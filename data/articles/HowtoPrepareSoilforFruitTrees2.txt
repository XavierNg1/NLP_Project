 These can be bought at many hardware stores, home centers, or even some general retailers, like Walmart and Target. Some tests include strips, vials, and mild reagents to test your soil and interpret the results, other tests send samples to labs for analysis, some kits do both!, Technically, you can test your soil whenever you feel like it, but choosing your moment has its benefits. Testing in fall or early in spring will give you time to make adjustments to your soil before planting.

Also, shoot dry conditions when testing your soil. Moisture in your sample can sometimes throw readings off.If you live in a part of the world where your growing season doesn't start in spring and end in fall, perform your test instead at either the start or end of your growing season.
 A mild soap and water will be more than enough to prepare your tools. Rinse all soap thoroughly from the tools, as it can give a false reading. Dry the tools with paper towel, and you’re ready to take a sample.

Similarly, wash, clean, and dry a bucket for harvesting samples. Lay out some newspaper on a flat, out of the way location; this is where you'll set out samples to dry., You want a good cross-section of the planting area. Dig five holes spaced out evenly around where you’ll be planting. Each hole should be 6 to 8 in (15.2 to 20.3 cm) deep. Harvest soil samples by cutting a half-inch (1.3 cm) slice from the side of each hole.

Harvested soil goes right in the bucket. When you’ve harvested all your samples, mix them together. When the soil is well mixed, lay it out on the newspaper you prepared earlier to dry.
When necessary, use the sample container that came with your kit to collect the required amount of soil (usually, it’s about a pint).
pH tests often only require you to add a reagent to a sample. The interaction between these two should create a vivid change in color, indicating the pH level according to the kit’s pH color chart.

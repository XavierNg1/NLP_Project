 This seems like a simple step, but it is commonplace to hear: His after shave was so overpowering, or his deodorant smelt so cheap. Another complaint is smelling sweaty.


Men: Throw away the deodorant sprays and invest in roll-on deodorant. Not only will you not be overpowering and cheap smelling, your body odour will be better and will last the whole night, no matter how much you perspire.
Ladies: Do the same. Don't believe in all those sexy ads. If it's your time of the month, purchase some dermatological and gynaecological tested spray deodorant for intimate hygiene.;
, Even if you have brushed your teeth, never take it for granted that your breath is fine, so keep breath mints on hand. Don't use chewing gum, as there is nothing more off putting than someone chewing all the time. Besides if you are going for a meal, what are you going to do with the gum at mealtime? Most people don't know what they look like when they are chewing gum, so do yourself a favour and don't do it.

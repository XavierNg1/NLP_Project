 Right after completing the “The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller” quest, head to the small town of Riverwood, directly south of Whiterun. In the middle of the town you’ll find a small inn called the Sleeping Giant Inn. Enter the building through its front door.;
, Inside the inn you’ll find Delphine, one of the female members of the Blades, a group of ancient dragon hunters. Talk to her and she’ll tell you that dragons are being resurrected and that the next one will come from a place called Kynesgrove.
 From Riverwood, travel to the city of Windhelm—the easternmost city on the map, just a little northeast of Whiterun. From Windhelm, head directly southwards until you find an old inn with a few tents around. This is Kynesgrove.


You’ll also find a dragon flying around this area. When you see the creature hovering in the skies, you’ll know you’re already near Kynesgrove.
 Once you arrive in Kynesgrove, Anduin, the main antagonist dragon, will start the ritual of bringing back Sahloknir to life. Wait for the ritual to end and Sahloknir to arise.


Don’t bother attacking Anduin during the ritual because he’s invulnerable to any attacks. After the ritual is complete, Sahloknir will start attacking you.
 Sahloknir will land every time he attacks you (he won’t be attacking you in mid-flight). While he’s on the ground, you’ll be able to reach him. Use whatever weapon or spell your Dragonborn has to attack and damage the monster. Once he’s sustained sufficient damage, he will fly off again.
 Sahloknir will also be randomly blowing fire breaths at you while he’s on land. This attack is pretty hard to dodge at close range since dragons are quick at breathing flames. Once you notice that Sahloknir is about to open his mouth, quickly jump out of his way to avoid the breath of fire.
 Depending on the strength of your main character, you can kill Sahloknir in one hit. But if you fail to do so, just repeat steps 5 and 6 until all the dragon’s life points is spent.

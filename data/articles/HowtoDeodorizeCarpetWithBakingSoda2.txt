 Is the bad odor neutralized? One treatment will be sufficient to neutralize most bad odors. If the carpet had a particularly strong smell, you might need to give it a second treatment. Remember, the longer you let baking soda sit on the carpet, the better it will neutralize odors.
 If your carpet is quite dirty, baking soda alone might not get rid of the smell. You may want to do a deeper cleaning and shampoo your carpet in preparation for a baking soda treatment. This will increase the likelihood that the treatment will work.
,, For the smelliest of carpets, you may want to add a fresh scent to replace the old smell. To scent your baking soda, pour it into a large bowl. Add five to ten drops of essential oil. Use a whisk to stir the scent in and integrate it into the soda. Spoon the soda into a shaker, then treat your carpet as directed. The following fresh scents will help counteract the smell:









Lemon or lemongrass
Lavender
Eucalyptus
Cedar

,, If you let your carpet go too long between cleanings, the bad smells will build right back up. Stay on top of your carpet's cleanliness by using a baking soda treatment every few weeks or at least once a month. The baking soda is more likely to completely eliminate odors that haven't been lingering for months or years at a time.

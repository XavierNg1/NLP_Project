 Ask her if she wants to talk about it.You can say, "I can tell that you've been really upset lately. Is something wrong?" She may want to talk and has been waiting for the invitation. Therefore, listen to her answer.Be silent and don't interrupt. You don't need to offer you words of advice unless she asks.


If she doesn't want to talk, respect her choice. She may be too hurt at the moment and feels she'll break down if she talks about it. She may just need to process the situation and her feelings for awhile. Give her some time, and let her know you're there when she feels like talking.;
, Remind her that she's a great person and how much she means to you. Acknowledge her feelings when she shares her pain. You could say something like "I know that's got to hurt. I'm sorry you're going through this."Continue to show her kindness and encourage her. Continue to be a loyal friend. Now is not the time to abandon her or avoid her.


Don't go around telling others about her problem.
If she asks for your advice, then give it.
If you don't know what to tell her, then suggest someone else who could, like another trusted friend, a family member, or a professional.
 If you can't understand, then just listen. You can offer support without encouraging a situation with which you disagree. Don't condemn her and rub salt in her wound. For instance, if she's upset over a fight she had with her husband, don't say, "I told you that you should have never married him."


If you can't say anything in her favor, then simply tell her that you're here for her regardless.Don't minimize her feelings.
A hug and a squeeze of the hand speaks volumes., Your friend may be grumpy or short with you, and she may snap at you. Don't take it personally. Ignore it and realize she's not herself. She's under a lot of stress, and you know that she's seen better and happier days.

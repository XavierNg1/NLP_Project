 Hair can be a great asset when cared for properly but can also detract from your appearance if neglected. Even if you have no time to put it up, make sure it’s brushed and that you have a ponytail holder with you.


Wash your hair regularly. Gently towel-dry it and let it air-dry as often as possible; blow-drying is hard on your hair.
Condition your hair to keep it looking healthy and vibrant. Find a formula that works for you; nothing is one-size-fits-all.;
, Of course you want to minimize flaws and accentuate your best features, but don’t pack it on; unnatural makeup makes you look fake. If you want people to think you are real, then be real and look real.


A touch of base, a hint of blush, a bit of eye shadow, eyeliner, and mascara can help bring your face to life.
To avoid looking like a painted lady, choose colours that compliment your natural colouring.
Go natural if that’s what feels best to you. Be sure to eat right, drink lots of water, and pamper your skin to make it glow.

 This way, you can try on your shoes, bag, and dress all together at the dress shop. If you change your mind, you can at least return the bag and shoes if time allows, and you will only have to pay the lay away fee rather than getting stuck with an expensive dress no one else would necessarily want.


Shoes usually look best when they are of the similar color or suit the color of the dress. A nice pair of heels is good if you want to be a bit taller.
When it comes to jewelry, don't go overboard, too much can just ruin the look of the dress and make it look cluttered.

 Move to an open area where your horse has a free range of movement. Grab a small treat that your horse will be interested in; carrots work particularly well for this stretch because of their length.
 The following stretches should be done on both sides of your horse, and from a position parallel to or just behind their front legs., Hold the treat near your horse’s head so that they become aware of it, and then bribe them into stretching by moving the treat down past the fetlock. Try to have them hold this stretch for 10-15 seconds before releasing and giving them the treat. The stretches the horse’s neck back and downwards.

If your horse can’t reach as far as you would like them to, simply lessen the distance at first and over time their muscles will become accustomed to it.
 Take another treat and, standing in the same location, get your horse’s attention and direct their head straight back towards their withers. Hold the treat just below their shoulder (a bit above their belly) and keep it there for 10-15 seconds. Then, release the pressure and give your horse the treat., Using another treat or the rest of your carrot, guide your horse’s neck down and back a bit between their legs. Instead of reaching to the outside of the fetlock, reach to the inside of the fetlock and hold the position for 10-15 seconds. Release the stretch and reward your horse with the treat., In order to prevent your horse becoming one-sided or pulled out of shape, be sure to stretch them on both sides. Follow the aforementioned directions for stretching downwards and straight back on both the right and left side.

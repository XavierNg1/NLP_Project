 Saying "gomen nasai" is an informal way of apologizing, used for friends. It's said as "go-MEN-naH-SAI".

More informally, you can say "gomen" (ごめん) or "gomen ne/na" (ごめんね/ごめんな), which are pronounced the same way as the "gomen" in "gomen nasai". "Gomen na" is a casual way for a man or boy to apologize to his friends and is never used by women.;
, This is more often used as something more similar to "excuse me", but is still classed as an apology - for example, if you bump into someone on the street. Pronounce it as "sue-me-MAH-sen"., This is often translated as "pardon me", but it actually would literally mean "allow me to bother you", and is a step up from "sumimasen". Pronounce this as "SHE-tsu-ray-shi-MAS" or "SHE-tsu-ray-shi-MA-she-ta".

While this saying is fairly polite, you can be even more polite by saying "shitsurei itashimasu" (失礼いたします). This is said as "SHE-tsu-ray-e-ta-shi-mas".
If you're having trouble with the "tsu" part, think of how the name of a breed of dog, the Shih Tzu, is pronounced. Instead of making the sharp "tzu" sound, soften the sound a bit so it's more of a "tsu".
 In a case where you're apologizing to someone like your boss or someone who is higher up, you would say this. It is said as "MO-she-wah-keh-ah-REE-ma-SEN".

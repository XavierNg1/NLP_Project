 Fill up a clean spray bottle with plain water. If you're reusing an old spray bottle, make sure it is clean and free of the chemicals before you use it.
 Use the spray bottle to spritz the shirt on all sides. Dampening the fibers will help it shrink. Don't completely soak the shirt, or you may end up with a smaller size than you want.


If you only want the shirt to shrink in certain areas, such as around the arm holes, then you can just spritz the shirt in these areas., Put the shirt in the dryer on the "permanent press" cycle and let it dry for two minutes at a time.Check it every two minutes and dry longer as needed. Remove the shirt from the dryer when it is completely dry. If the shirt was stretched out before, it should now be refreshed and ready to wear.


If you want it to shrink more, repeat the process and use a higher heat setting on your dryer.
Place a fabric softener sheet in the dryer with your shirt to freshen up the smell, too.

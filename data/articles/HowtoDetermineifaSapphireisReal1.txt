 Use a jeweler’s magnifying glass, at least 10x magnification, to inspect the sapphire closely. Natural sapphires form with tiny bits of other matter in them, so look for small specks and blemishes. These flaws are a good indication that a sapphire is real.Lab-created (fake) sapphires do not have inclusions of this nature, and some natural sapphires don’t have flaws either, but if you find flaws it is real.;
, Take your sapphire and breathe on it to fog it up. Count how long it takes for the fog to start fading and how long until the fog is totally gone. Natural gems should clear up in just one or two seconds, but created sapphires may take closer to five seconds to clear up., Gemologists can examine a sapphire and determine what kind of gem it is. They will give you a report on what they decide about the sapphire once they have analyzed it. They can tell you if it is natural or synthetic, treated or not, as well as many other attributes.Once the gemologists have fully examined the gem, they will give you an official statement. If you have an old family sapphire that you are sure is natural and valuable, it is good to have it certified to ensure that you get the best value if you sell it.
A certified sapphire will be easier to sell for a good price.

 Eliminate the time between bacon retrieval (huzzah!) and the check-out counter. You don't want it to cool down under your pile of Captain Crunch and Miracle Whip. When you get home, promptly place the package of bacon in the refrigerator. Store the bacon at 40ºF/4.4ºC or lower.


If you have a cold storage bag, make use of it! Keep it cool on the journey home. Your bacon deserves an honorable last few days, does it not?

, Nowadays if something doesn't come with at least four ingredients that have 7 syllables, it's something to write home about. Luckily, healthier trends are picking up -- so if you have an extra dollar to spend, go for bacon with a list of ingredients you're confident in pronouncing.


Aim for four or so ingredients -- pork (ya think?), water, salt, and brown sugar. That other stuff is the basics for curing pork (turning it into bacon). The crap in "regular" bacon is just preservatives and chemicals.
 That just means that they're not using sodium nitrate when the cure it and instead they use celery. However, celery has loads of nitrates, too (all veggies do), so it's really six of one and half a dozen of the other.


The best bacon will be grown (...suuuure) locally, use very few preservatives, be super fresh, and be from pigs that were raised humanely, of course. That being said, you could always cure it yourself!

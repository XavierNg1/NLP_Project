 If you hang out with them on a regular basis, you'll never be able to detach yourself. Occupy your time with healthy diversions. This way, you'll be telling the truth when you tell the person you don't have time to hang out.

If you hang out with them, avoid physical contact. Don't hug, touch hands, kiss, or have sex. These actions can stir up the feelings you're trying to conquer.;
, Don't read their posts or timelines on social media. Don't call, text, or email as often (or at all). If they call you, keep the conversation short. If you're busy distracting yourself with other things, you'll have a valid excuse for saying, “Sorry. Gotta go!”, Gather them together in a box or two and bury them in a closet or attic. If you have the money, rent a personal storage garage. Store digital files on a flash drive that you can store with the other mementos. Keep them hidden until your feelings for the person cool down., Forget about their cute face and concentrate on their annoying neediness. Recall that argument you got into over politics or religion. Think about how you felt when they told you they want five kids, but you don't want any. Focus on the real deal breakers that would make a relationship difficult or impossible.

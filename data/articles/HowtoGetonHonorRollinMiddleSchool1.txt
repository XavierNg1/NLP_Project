 Remember what was challenging last year for you and study it! You could go online and find a good website, get a book from your library or find one on Amazon. If you don't feel like studying over summer,you could do something like go to a museum if you have the time, or invite a friend over for a study session (that also happens to involve video game breaks). There are many ways to review what you know when school's out, even in fun ways! Just remember not to overdo it, because if it's not feeling fun and you don't want to do it, then you won't focus as much, you won't learn as much, and it will be frustrating.;
, If you excelled last year, then you might want to think about skipping ahead and covering next year's material. Say you're going into 6th grade and last year you aced every math test you had. If it's too easy for you, you could print out some 6th grade level tests and see how you do. You could also think about skipping a grade if all of the 6th grade material is SUPER easy. But it's good to prepare over the summer because you know what's coming and you have a head start on some things.
 Go to Office Depot, Office Max, Staples, or another school supplies store and get them all ahead of time. Don't wait until school has started, because then everything will be gone. Go a week or two early, bring your school supply list, and shop away. I would recommend getting a Case-it, because they hold a lot and keep you very organized, and that's a big help for getting good grades. Here is a general list, though it may vary from school to school:


Case-it or binder
LOTS OF PENCILS  (People will "borrow them" like crazy, which means lose them)
Lined Paper
Red pen
Highlighters
Folders and notebooks (you may want to wait on these because some classes require them and some don't)
Depending on teacher, you could need colored pencils, tape, scissors, and more

, When you're ready, bounce off your hands and knees, tuck tight and fast and push your hips BACK and UP. You should rotate to land on your back or in a seat drop position.
 They'll bounce with you in time and you'll try front somersault from standing. The other person is there to push you round if you under rotate, to ensure you don't land incorrectly(causing painful injuries .
 Start the somersault at the peak of your bounce(your arms should be high above your head), bring the arms down as you tuck your knees to your chest, hold your knees if you want. Push your hips hard backwards and upwards and tuck your head in, trying to power your rotation. Make sure that the other person throws in a crash mat if it seems you will land badly.
 When you think you are around 2/3 of the way round and you see the distant sky(or if you're inside, a point above head height that you've already decided on), open up straight and you should land on your feet. Once you can do the somersault unaided several times, the person should not need to throw the mat in any longer.

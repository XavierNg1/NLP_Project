 Urinary catheters are inserted temporarily following many surgical procedures. Once you have recovered from the surgery, or the obstruction has been removed, you donâ€™t need the catheter anymore.For example, if you have prostate surgery, you will generally receive a catheter that can be taken out 10 to 14 days after surgery.
Follow your medical provider's post-surgical guidelines and recommendations. These will be individualized to your health care situation.
 Your catheter will only need to be replaced if you cannot independently empty your bladder. People who get a catheter because they have a chronic illness or incontinence (a condition where you have a problem holding urine inside) that has been caused by an injury may need to have a catheter for a long period of time.


For example, if you suffered a spinal cord injury that has caused you to develop incontinence, you will need to have a catheter in place for a long period of time. Replace your catheter with a fresh one every 14 days or as directed by manufacturer or physician recommendations.
 Some people experience complications when they get a catheter. One of the most common negative side effects is developing a urinary tract infection. If you see any pus near your urethra, or have cloudy, bloody, or foul-smelling urine, you may have a urinary tract infection. Your catheter will have to be removed and you should talk to your doctor about treating your tract infection.


You may also notice a large amount of urine coming out from around the catheter. If you do notice this, remove the catheter. It is most likely defective.
If there is no urine draining into the catheter, there may be an obstruction in the device. If this is the case, it needs to be removed immediately and you should go to the doctor right away. Do not irrigate your catheter without first consulting a healthcare professional.

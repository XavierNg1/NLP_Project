Death Knights begin with 2 of each type of rune: Blood, Frost and Unholy.
After a rune has been used, it will be unavailable, or on "cooldown," for 10 seconds.
Nearly all abilities that require runes also build runic power, the second resource for Death Knights.;
,,


For instance, a Death Knight with most of his talent points in the Unholy tree may choose to use Death Coil as his primary runic power ability, since that tree offers a boost to that particular ability.
Death Knights specialized in player-vs-player (PvP) combat will probably prefer to save their runic power for an ability like Hungering Cold.



You can, and should, test your ability rotation on a training dummy, located in most major cities.
Look for holes in the rotation where no runes are available and your runic power is insufficient to power any other ability.



For instance, the Chains of Ice ability slows down a target for a short period, which can be helpful for a Death Knight in PvP.
The Death Grip ability pulls an enemy to you, allowing you to save less-armored players or control an enemy that is otherwise difficult to position.
Practice these abilities while questing and in battlegrounds to become proficient.
 The time it takes to find an ability on your hot bar, or to move your hand to the mouse so that you can click an ability, can be the difference between failure and success, especially for a Death Knight in PvP.



Your primary stats are Strength and Stamina and you should never be wearing any armor type other than plate.
The typical Death Knight spec will benefit most from a two-handed weapon such as an axe, mace or sword. Rarely will you encounter a problemÂ  with the appropriate stats for your class.

 When you’re pairing a headband with a ponytail or braid, the look tends to be more casual. Look for a bohemian-inspired headband to coordinate with the more relaxed style, such as one that features artificial flowers or leaves. A woven or feathered headband also works well with a ponytail or braid., Once you’ve settled on a headband, pull your hair back into the ponytail or braid of your choice. Use a hair elastic or clip to secure your hair, and apply some flexible hold hairspray if you’re concerned that it might come loose.








You can pull your hair into a traditional ponytail at the middle of the back of your hair, opt for a high ponytail at the crown of your head, or go for a low pony right at the nape of your neck. A side pony also looks cute with a headband.
You can also put your hair in pigtails if you aren’t a fan of ponytails.
French braids look especially good with a headband, but you can do your any braid that you like, such as a traditional rope or fishtail braid.
 After you’ve finished putting your hair into a ponytail or a braid, place the headband in your hair and push it into place. You don’t necessarily need to position it ½ inch (1.27 cm) from your hairline as you would with your hair down. Depending on the placement of your pony or braid, you may want to push it further back in your hair.








You may want to pull some strands of hair free from the headband around your face for a softer look. You can also pull your bangs free if you prefer.

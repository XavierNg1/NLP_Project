 The more you learn, the easier it is to raise awareness! Be sure to read articles from writers who are actually autistic, not just non-autistic therapists who can only guess at what being autistic is like.;
, Make sure that the organizations you support are well-respected within the autistic community; some "charities" actually spread damaging rhetoric that hurts autistic people.


A good way to spot harmful charities is to search the internet for "_____ controversy." If many autistic people write articles talking about how harmful it is, it's not a good charity.
Bad organizations will talk about about "missing children," "fixing" people, how "autism is a puzzle," "ruined" families, "cures" for autism, and basically any rhetoric that child murderers use to talk about their disabled victims.
 Speaking to them in person can help you understand their needs and desires. Furthermore, autistic people can be loyal, sincere, and insightful friends.
 You are promoting an organization that hurts people, and preventing people from recognizing its damage.
 When you have enough money, donate it to an autistic-run organization that helps improve people's lives! Examples of positive organizations are the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN) and the Autistic Women's Network. Both are run by autistic people.
 Teach love and respect. If you have any autistic friends or family members, offer to let them help run the page.


Let your page be a tool for activism that organizes people to help. For example, start letter-writing campaigns and petitions to label anti-autism groups as hate groups.
A stance clearly in favor of autism acceptance will let autistic people around the world feel safe and appreciated for who they are.

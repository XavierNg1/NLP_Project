 You can purchase styrofoam balls at most arts and crafts shops, online, or at the dollar store. Take the pointed end of a chopstick and push it through the bottom of your styrofoam ball. Insert the chopstick half way into the ball, and make sure not to push it all the way through.Pull out your chopstick and fill the hole that it made with an adhesive like glue or silicone.


The adhesive will ensure that your stick stays securely inside the ball.
Get different sized styrofoam balls to add contrast to your garden.
 Insert your chopstick into the hole that you just filled with glue. Allow the glue to set so that they hold your chopsticks firmly in place. Once the glue has dried, you can use the chopsticks to hold your small gazing balls in the dirt.
 Dab strong glue onto the marbles before sticking them onto your ball. Using a hot glue gun may also be effective at holding the marbles onto your ball.You can use plastic gemstones as an alternative to marbles.
You can also use grout and cover the surface of your ball before placing your marbles onto it.
 Allow your gazing balls to dry for a full 24 hours before you place them in your garden. Insert the end of the chopstick into the ground to plant them. Plant your gazing balls around flowers that compliment their style and color. Exposure to the elements should change the white of the styrofoam to different colors.

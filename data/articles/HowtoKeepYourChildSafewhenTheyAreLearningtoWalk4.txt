 Do a sweep of outside areas to locate and remove any unsafe items that might be dangerous for a mobile baby.


Items like lawn equipment, toys for older children, and gardening tools should be kept in a locked shed out of the reach of your baby.
 Call your garage door manufacturer to install a motion detector on the garage door to ensure that it will stop closing if it detects the motion of your child nearby.
 If you have a pool, install special exterior baby gates around it and make sure to always monitor your baby when he or she is outside. A fence that is at least four feet tall with gaps no wider than three inches should be installed around the perimeter of the pool. For extra protection, cover the pool with a rigid, motorized cover, as flimsy plastic covers can cave in if a child walks on top.


Pool professionals in your area can recommend specific products and install all of your pool safety needs.
 If your home has an alarm system, set it to chime or beep whenever a door or window is opened. This will help you to intercept an escaping child and prevent disaster before it occurs.

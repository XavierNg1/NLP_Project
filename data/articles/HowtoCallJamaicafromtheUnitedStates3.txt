 Although your cellphone can make and receive calls to and from Jamaica, call from a landline if you have one. If the recipient also has a landline, be sure to dial that number if possible, rather than their cellphone's, in order to save them money. Ask them to do the same if you expect them to call you back in the future. Avoid having both parties being billed for one phone call, regardless of who called who, which may happen if the call is made to or from a cellphone.Also, calling cellphones via your Skype account may cost more per minute than calling a landline., Although the Jamaican phone number is formatted just like a U.S. number, it is technically an international number and will be billed as such.If no one is answering and you know how many times the recipient’s voicemail will allow the phone to ring before picking up, hang up before the call “connects,” since a connection will result in a charge. If cost is no object, go ahead and leave a message.
 Find your most recent phone bill covering your average amount of calls to Jamaica. Add up the charges for those calls. Compare the total to the monthly rate for a flat-rate plan with unlimited international minutes. If the flat-rate plan is cheaper, switch to that.


Be sure to factor in any extra charges for set-up and cancellation, as well as any others, to make sure that switching will really be worth it.
 If you expect to make calls to Jamaica regularly, but not enough to warrant the extra money that a flat-rate plan will cost, compare various calling-card rates versus your own phone plan. Do plenty of comparative shopping first, though. Be aware that many cards have hidden fees and surcharges, which means your card’s value may decrease significantly over time if you don’t use it up in one phone call.

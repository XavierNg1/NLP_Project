 Let's suppose you want to add Bromidric acid to 1-butene. Split the acid molecule as hydrogen ion plus a bromide anion. Link the hydrogen ion atom to one of the two carbon atom of the double bond. Put a positive charge on the other carbon atom involved in the C-C double bond. You have obtained what is called a carbocation.
 Which of the C-C bond atoms does carry the positive charge? How many carbon atoms is it bonded with? Remember that carbocations are placed in this order by decreasing stability: tertiary > secondary > primary. In the case of propene , you have two possible outcomes: a primary and a secondary carbocation. The secondary carbocation is much more stable than the primary one so it's the only actual carbocation you obtain., Bond the halogen anion to the carbon atom that carries the positive charge of the carbocation., Give a IUPAC name to the compound you have obtained. In our example you should obtain 2-chlorobutane.

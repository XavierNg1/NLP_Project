 It is extremely important to choose cupcake liners that will match the rest of your party d√©cor. You do not want your cupcakes sticking out like a sore thumb, you want them to stick out like a 10 carat diamond ring...nice! There are many stores that have quality cupcake liners in almost any color and design imaginable. If you are not cooking cupcakes for any special event, you don't need to worry about the color or design of the wrapper, unless you just feel like being creative.;
, You never know what may happen during the cupcake cooking process, so you will want to make sure that you order a couple extra cupcake liners in case a mishap happens and you have to toss a batch of cupcakes. If you run out of cupcake liners while cooking your cupcakes, you will either have to a) drive to the store, hope they still have the same ones, and purchase more cupcake liners, b) order more from the online store you purchased them from and hope they have an overnight shipping option, c) make less cupcakes than what you planned to make.
 You will need to place a liner in each indentation or "cup" in the cupcake pans before you pour the batter into the pan.
 Depending on how you will decorate your cupcakes, you will need to fill each cupcake liner with batter. If you want a crown on your cupcake (or for your cupcake to look more like a mushroom) you will need to fill the cupcake liner three-quarters of the way. If you do not want a crown and need a flat or sunken surface for your decorating needs, you should not fill the cupcake liner more than halfway.

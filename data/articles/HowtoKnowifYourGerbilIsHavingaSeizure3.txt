 There is nothing you can do for gerbils during a seizure. Most gerbils seize for a very short amount of time and then recover quickly. However, during or after the seizure, you should move your gerbil to a quiet, dark, stress-free environment.You can move the cage to a bedroom or another room that doesn’t get used often. This helps reduce the stressors that can induce seizures.
 For most gerbils with seizures, there is no treatment. The seizures usually go away after six months of age, and they cause no permanent brain damage. This means there is no standard treatment for seizures. Your gerbil can live a happy, healthy life with the seizures.However, if there is a related problem to the seizures, your vet may consider giving the gerbil anticonvulsant medication to treat the seizures and related problems.
 While most gerbils that have seizures are fine and don’t need medical attention, there are some conditions that may require you to seek medical attention. If your gerbil suffers from grand mal seizures, you may want to get them checked out by your vet, just in case.You also should take your gerbil to the vet if the seizures last for a long time, like over a minute or two.

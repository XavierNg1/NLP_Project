 Hoodies are typically considered to be casual garments, but an easy way to instantly dress them up and add some style is by choosing a dark color like black or dark gray. Dark, plain colors will automatically upgrade the hoodie’s appearance and create a sleeker look. If you pair it with dark denim and basic trainers, you can look both polished and casual.Try pairing a dark gray hoodie with black skinny jeans.
If you find a plain black hoodie to be a bit boring, opt for a dark rich color like maroon or navy.;
, Hoodies have a reputation for unstylishness for a few reasons, and one of the major ones is because of the sweatshirt material classic hoodies are made of. There’s certainly nothing wrong with this style of hoodie, but if you want it to look fashionable, step things up with a high quality material. Look for hoodies made of high-end materials like pure cotton jersey, brushed cotton and fleece.If you have the extra money to spend, consider a hoodie made of a cashmere-silk blend.
 If you want your hoodie to look polished, avoid oversized and ill-fitting versions that bunch up around the stomach area. These will create the illusion of a paunch and look sloppy in general. Look for hoodies that have a slim fit to create a sleek, fashionable silhouette.If possible, try a hoodie on before you make a purchase to make sure it fits the way you want it to, especially if you are spending extra money on a high-end fabric.

 Consider the following questions:


How many seedlings do you want to grow? Use this amount to determine how many rolls you'll need.
Where will you place the seedling starters? Choose a suitable spot unlikely to be in the way of everyday things and that is warm.
What are the requirements of the seeds that you would like to plant? Think about germination temperature, light and humidity. If you're not sure, use a gardener's guide which has information about the particular plant you wish to grow.;
, You'll need empty toilet or paper towel cardboard rolls, the amount being determined by the amount of seedlings you're going to grow. You'll also need the items listed under Things You'll Need below.
 Cut the toilet rolls into rings roughly 4cm wide.
 Do not compress the paper too much.
, Tear the top layers of toilet paper in the ring and place a seed in the tear and close the tear over the seed.
,, The toilet paper and cardboard will suck up most of the water. Slowly tilt the plate to ensure even wetting of all seedling starters.
 Puff up the plastic bag to make room for the seedlings and tie the bag lightly to keep the air and moisture inside.
, You don't want to miss the sprouts popping up!

, Plant the seedlings into potting soil or straight into the garden by placing the biodegradable seed starter directly into the soil.  Mix a small amount of liquid plant food with the water and add it to the plate if you are not planting the seedling out directly after germination.

 Are three does kindling tomorrow? Is it weaning time for a litter today? Check these dates to prepare for the day or coming day.
 Bed each nest box (tightly in the winter). Use straw and/or old cloth for this job. Does will pull some fur out, but this doesn't hurt her.
 Keep breeding simple. Don't breed 17 does at a time.

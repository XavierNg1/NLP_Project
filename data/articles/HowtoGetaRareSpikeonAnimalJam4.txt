 There are tons of giveaways on YouTube and in the game for countless good items.
 YouTube is the best place to go for giveaways. Just check the description to see when this was published. You can get items that can help you get a spiked collar, (for example, the wrists, the betas, etc.) or spiked collars themselves.


On YouTube, try searching for an item that you could use to get a spike, or a spike itself. Watch the full video for giveaway details and enter with everything necessary. Be sure to like the giveaway video and subscribe to the channel, even if it isn't necessary. Wait until the giveaway is over, and receive your item if you won!
Use proper grammar and spelling. Avoid abbreviations and slang.
Watch the whole video, as watching the entire video will help you to understand the rules and who is currently in the lead and when the giveaway will end. If it is by a New Jammer or a noob, don't bother, though.
 If it's an OP person like Wolffeycat, trade away. You will have that 10Â % of winning.


Consider joining giveaways in streams or ones by famous jammers. These giveaways are obviously free of scams, since a famous jammer cannot scam their own fans.
In-game, most giveaways are scams, but you will find a few legit ones. Watch out for trust trading, flash trading, or gifting your items. These are three main ways to get scammed. Instead, look for giveaways where you directly get gifted(or traded) the item(s), or you tell the host a reason why you want that item.

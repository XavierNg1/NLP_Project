 You can create anything with the right lines of code – cartoons, websites, and software programs are just the most common. You might also be able to create something that no one has ever seen before. If you think about coding as an outlet for your creativity – the same way painting or writing are – you might become more interested in coding itself.For example, you could learn JavaScript to create cartoons or animations based on a story you're written.
You could also use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to create any kind of website - for a company, a product, or even your own blog.;
, If you love to read, you can use coding to build a website to write your own book reviews or blog about books you love. If you love cartoons, you can code your own animation. Think about your passions and then come up with ways that coding can help you pursue them.If you like music, for example, you can learn website coding that allows you to create a website where you can review your favorite music. With the right coding language, you can embed music samples or links to your favorite bands' websites,

, If you set out to learn coding just for the sake of learning how to code, you might not stay interested in it. Instead, have a specific goal for the coding you want to do. Tell yourself you’ll make one page of a website, or a few frames or a cartoon. Having a goal can help keep you focused and make learning to code feel less overwhelming.

 You can make TMNT themed invitations/emails. Example: (look at image) "It's a TMNT sleepover!" Make sure that your friends at least know who the TMNT are or like them. It'll be kind of awkward with them receiving the message or getting there and being like, "Who the heck are they?!";
, You can draw some pictures of your own or just print them off and tape them wherever you can! Go to Party City or another costume store and buy a costume of your favorite character. If you can't find one, you can order one online or make one of your own. (look some articles up on hereÂ :)

, Yummy...Go to your local bake shop (or wherever you can find a cake!) and order a TMNT cake. If you can't find one, ask someone that's talented with cake making or make it yourself!

, Maybe you have some of the old ones on DVD/Blueray, or maybe you can watch them on Youtube. Your party, your pick!

, All work and no play can really mess up a loyal fan (that's why they get so irritated and impatient while waiting for the newest movie/series to come out). Try to help your friends with having fun (if they're not used to this much Turtle partying)and try to explain the characters and plots during the movies if you've seen they before.

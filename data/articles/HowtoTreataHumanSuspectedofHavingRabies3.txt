 This is where the bitten person will have a raised temperature above 37.6 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). When your body senses a foreign invader, it creates a fever to burn the invading bacteria or virus out. Use a thermometer to see what the person's temperature is. If it is elevated above 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, it means the person has a fever.
 This is where the bitten person produces increased amounts of saliva. The saliva is caused by spasms that affect the muscles in your throat. The person will have pain when swallowing and therefore saliva will gather in his or her mouth. If you notice strings of drool (saliva) coming out of the person's mouth, you should consider this a red flag and get them to a hospital., The tingling sensation could also be described like ‘pins and needles’, particularly in the spot where the bite occurred. This happens because the virus begins affecting the person’s nerves and causing damage to them. If the bitten person complains of feeling like there are needles pricking his or her skin, consider taking him or her to the hospital.
 A muscle contraction occurs when a person’s muscle moves but you didn’t mean for it to actually move. When muscles contract, they become very tight and do not relax. This can happen to just one part of the body, or it can happen in several parts of the body at once.Muscle contractions are another red flag that means you need to get that person to a hospital.
 Injuries hurt and getting bitten is no different. The difference instead is that the nerves around the bite spot could be reacting to the virus, which is causing them pain. If the person begins to complain of pain in the area, monitor it for awhile. If the pain gets worse rather than getting better, go to the hospital.

 Flashlights and laser pointers are great ways to amuse your cat (and you). Turn the lights off and turn the flashlight or laser on. Cats will chase the lit-up dots or streams of light for a long time if they're in the mood.


Given that cats may run into other things when chasing, exercise caution when moving the flashlight to ensure you will not harm your cat in her attempts to pounce on the light.
When using a laser pointer, be careful not to aim the pointer in your cat's eyes.

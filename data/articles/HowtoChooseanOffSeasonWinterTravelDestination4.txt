 Peak tourist season in Europe will render popular destinations overcrowded and coincides with unpleasantly warm summer weather. Some destinations popularly visited in the winter months—especially warmer destinations in southern Europe, such as Italy, Greece, and Spain—can be equally pleasant in the spring and fall months, when crowds have died down and many hotels offer discounted fares.If you have specific European destinations you’d like to visit (e.g. museums, restaurants, vineyards, or historical sites), make sure to check online beforehand to see if the destinations are still open in the off season., Seasons are reversed between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres: summer in the Northern occurs during winter in the Southern. This means that during the Northern off season, you can visit Southern Hemisphere destinations during the peak of their winter. This increases the range of travel opportunities you can take advantage of during the off season.


Southern-hemisphere destinations, including Australia and New Zealand, can be visited relatively inexpensively during their off season (summer in the Northern Hemisphere).These destinations may be quite cold when you visit, naturally—although you’ll mostly be at risk for rainstorms., If you visit an African destination—for example, South Africa—during the months of May through September, you’ll be arriving in the middle of the Southern-Hemisphere winter. However, this is a good time to visit sub-Saharan Africa, especially if you plan to spend time outdoors in the natural world. The cooler temperatures will mean fewer tourists.If you choose to visit Africa, you will be able to find highly discounted rates in wilderness lodges, and travel with tour groups (including those giving safari-like photography tours) for relatively cheaply.

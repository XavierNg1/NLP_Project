 The roots or rhizomes will need a thorough washing to get off any mud or dirt. Although it may be more difficult to clean the roots than the shoots, you will be peeling the roots afterwards, so donâ€™t worry too much about it., Chop off the corms, which are the small stubby parts of the root. The corms are located at the bottom of the cattails. Cut this bulbous part off. Use a knife or a vegetable peeler to peel the corms. Try to get off any deeply ingrained dirt. You should have a tender heart of cattail flesh at the end of this process., Put some olive oil in a frying pan. Add the corms and fry them up. They taste a lot better fried but can also be eaten raw.You can also use butter or margarine to fry the corms.

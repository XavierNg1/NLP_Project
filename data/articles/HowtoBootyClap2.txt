 Again, just as before, the feet don’t need to be right next to each other. Stand in a normal stance with the feet under the hips and less than shoulder width apart. If you feel more comfortable, bring your feet closer together so that there is only an inch (2.54 cm) or two (5.08 cm) of space between your feet.If you are going to place your feet closer together, lean up against a wall or chair for extra support.
 Slowly, rise up on your toes and shift your weight to the balls of your feet. Use a wall or chair to help you balance if necessary. Or, you can take a little bit of a wider stance to help you balance.
 Then, straighten them. Then, bend your knees again and straighten them. Do this slowly at first. Then, move much faster -- as fast as you can go. Once you start moving faster, you’ll have to limit the range of motion, so it won’t look like you’re bending your knees.


In other words, your knee bending movements won’t be as large as before. Bounce slightly on your toes while you bend your knees. The two movements together help the booty clap. You should hear a clapping sound when you have done it correctly.
This method is easiest those that have a big butt already because it helps the butt jiggle.

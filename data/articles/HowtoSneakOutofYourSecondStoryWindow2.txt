 Look for a thick rope that will not break when you climb down it. You can test the rope by hanging it to a study object, such as a tree, and swinging on it. Look in your basement or garage to find a rope. If you cannot find a rope in your house, go to a hardware store.
 Take a few bedsheets (roughly 3-4) that, tied together, will reach from your bedroom to the ground. Take your bed sheets one at a time, and twist each one tightly, length wise. Then, tie a few knots in each sheet, and tie the sheets together. Double knot each knot tightly so that your sheet rope will not break., This can be a heavy bed frame, the foot of a sturdy desk or bookcase, etc. Whatever you tie your rope to, make sure it is something that cannot be moved by your weight. Double knot the rope when you tie it to your sturdy piece of furniture.


The object you're tying your rope to should weigh substantially more than you in order to hold your weight. To see if an object will hold your weight, try moving it with all of your strength. If you can't get it to budge, it should most likely be able to hold your weight.
 Open your window and remove the window screen if your window has one. Toss the rope out of your window so that it reaches down to the ground. Slowly and carefully climb out of the window, feet first, and begin to climb down the rope. Use the knots that you've tied into your rope to support your hands and feet as you climb down.


Leave the rope hanging down so you can climb back up it when you return home.

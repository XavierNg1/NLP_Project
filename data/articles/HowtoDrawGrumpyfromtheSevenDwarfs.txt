 All seven dwarves' heads are very round, like basketballs--look at the illustration to get it exactly right.;
, Connect it underneath the head as shown. This part will be the body.
 At this point Grumpy's body should sort of look like a falling-apart snowman.
 Draw the hands crossed over the upper part of the body (the left hand will be hidden under the right hand).
 The feet ovals should be longer than the others, so take that detail into account.
 Make a face with the right eye closed and the right eye opened, frowning eyebrows, a big nose, and a closed mouth. Put a cap over the head and a short, ruffled beard under his face.
 Draw a tunic over a chubby belly, secured with a buckled belt, as well as lumpy shoes on his feet.


Keep Grumpy's arms crossed against his chest to give him his distinctive irritated air.
 Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional. Erase any leftover pencil and add color!

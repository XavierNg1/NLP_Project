 Use warm water and work your hair into a healthy lather. Washing it every few days will remove all the dirt off, leaving it soft and manageable.


Comb your hair gently before you rinse out the shampoo. Do not use a brush while your hair is wet, but use one after you've rinsed the shampoo away. Rinse the shampoo off once you have combed your hair.
Avoid washing your hair with scalding hot water. Scalding water steals away the natural moisturizing oils from the hair. Use warm to cold water instead.;
, Hair has natural oils that come out with soap and water, and though conditioner can help replenish this oil, natural is better. Be sure to brush hair thoroughly, as this spreads these oils throughout the hair. For people with kinky or curly hair that frizzes when it is brushed, hair brushing should be done when hair is wet.









Simply wetting hair without washing, and before brushing can work, though you might want to apply a serum or leave-in conditioner that will help your hair from becoming overly frizzy.
People with oily hair can wash it more often, but people with dry hair should not wash their hair more than twice a week.
To shower without washing your hair, wear a shower cap or twist your hair into a bun and keep soap out of the bun. Be sure to brush your hair after it is cooped up in a bun or shower cap.
 You can find one at most hardware stores and home-and-garden stores. It will filter out the chlorine and various minerals from the water, resulting in healthier hair and skin.
 Dilute a tablespoon of powdered water softener (e.g., Calgon or 20-mule Borax) in a cup of warm water. Use it first to rinse shampoo out of your hair. Rinse out the rest of your shampoo in the shower. This will rid your hair of any residue from dirt and other hair products, including chemicals in your shampoo. Your hair should feel squeaky clean.









This softening treatment should not strip your hair of any natural nutrients, so feel free to use it every day.

 For this method, you will need a carrier oil such as sweet almond oil or jojoba oil, the essential oil(s) of your choice, and a dark glass container to store it in.


Carrier oils are important if you are going to be applying essential oils to your skin. This is because some essential oils can cause severe skin irritation if not diluted in a carrier oil first., You can choose any oils that you like, but for energizing purposes you will want to choose an oil that will wake you up. There are many that you can choose from. For example, peppermint, frankincense, ginger, bergamot, lemon, grapefruit, basil, thyme, tea tree, or clove. You will need to mix 10 to 12 drops into 1 fluid ounce of carrier oil. Some suggestions you can try include:4 drops basil, 2 drops cypress, and 4 drops grapefruit.
6 drops of grapefruit and 4 drops of ginger.
4 drops of rosemary and 6 drops of bergamot.
4 drops peppermint, 2 drops frankincense, and 4 drops of lemon

, If you have a close friend or significant other whom you feel comfortable asking, then you can ask them to rub the oil on your shoulders or back. The advantage of this is massages feel really nice, and it can help relax your muscles if you are feeling tense.


You can also offer to return the favor.
You only need to use around 1 Tablespoon of your oil for the massage.
 If you don’t have anyone you can ask, or don’t want someone else to massage you, don’t worry! You can also massage yourself with the oil. If you don’t like massaging yourself, you can also just rub the oil onto your skin to moisturize it.


Try massaging your hands, feet, arms, leg, neck or wherever it feels good. If you like, you can also massage some of the oil into your scalp, but be aware that it may make your hair slightly oily. Avoid sensitive areas such as your eyes, mouth, and genitals.

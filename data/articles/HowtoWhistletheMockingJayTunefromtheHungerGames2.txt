 You can listen to the whistle on repeat here:Â https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3PB5wAbwD4 First, just try to imitate the notes by yourself.
 The first note is easy to master, at a either a high or low G. It is the note that I automatically whistle when I whistle at all, and if you're lucky it will be like that for you too.
 To make your whistle go higher, contract your stomach and blow in a slightly different way.
 Expand your stomach instead of contracting it to whistle lower.
 Also, hold this note a little longer than each of the others to make sure it echos. And most of all, practice! Practice makes perfect!

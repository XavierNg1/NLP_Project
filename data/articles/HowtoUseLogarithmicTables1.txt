 To find loga(n), you'll need a loga table. Most log tables are for base-10 logarithms, called "common logs."

Example: log10(31.62) requires a base-10 table.
;
, Look for the cell value at the following intersections, ignoring all decimal places:

Row labeled with first two digits of n 

Column header with third digit of n

Example: log10(31.62) → row 31, column 6 → cell value 0.4997.
 Some tables have a smaller set of columns on the right side of the chart. Use these to adjust answer if n has four or more significant digits:

Stay in same row

Find small column header with fourth digit of n

Add this to previous value

Example: log10(31.62) → row 31, small column 2 → cell value 2 → 4997 + 2 = 4999.
 The log table only tells you the portion of your answer after the decimal point. This is called the "mantissa."

Example: Solution so far is ?.4999


, Also called the "characteristic". By trial and error, find integer value of p such that ap<n{\displaystyle a^{p}<n} and ap+1>n{\displaystyle a^{p+1}>n}.

Example: 101=10<31.62{\displaystyle 10^{1}=10<31.62} and 102=100>31.62{\displaystyle 10^{2}=100>31.62}. The "characteristic" is 1. The final answer is 1.4999

Note how easy this is for base-10 logs. Just count the digits left of the decimal and subtract one.

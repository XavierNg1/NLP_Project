 Roxanne is always playing a very optimistic, cute face. She is neither overly happy or sad. Also, she seems to be very thoughtful!;
, Roxanne doesn't under dress, and she doesn't overdress. Her clothes are very simple but girly, and basic colors. In the film, she is always wearing a blue-green short sleeved shirt with blue jean shorts that have a roll at the knees. On her feet are white slip ons, and she also has ball earrings.
 Her hair is big and bouffant, wavy and not curly or straight. Her bangs are cow licked, and swoop down, and one side of her hair is sometimes pulled behind her ear. If you really want the whole Roxanne look, dye your hair her color. It is a nice shade of reddish orange.
 If you want to go all the way then get brown contact lenses. Korean circle lenses would make your eyes look even bigger and more Disney like.
 She is definitely not skinny, and definitely not fat. Roxanne has curves and a round face, big hips and very nice legs. If you are not skinny then don't worry! Roxanne isn't either, and she still has a very nice body and shape for a cartoon character.
 This includes parties, school dances, concerts. Her best friend is Stacey, and if you are looking for a new best friend then make sure its someone like Stacey! Don't become friends with someone who is into drugs or alcohol.

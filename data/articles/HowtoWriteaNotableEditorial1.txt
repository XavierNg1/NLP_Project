 Editorials are meant to influence public opinion, promote critical thinking, and sometimes cause people to take action on an issue. Your topic should be current, interesting, and have a purpose. There are generally four types of editorials:



Explaining or interpreting: This format is used to explain how and why a newspaper or magazine took a certain stance on a controversial subject.

Criticizing: This format criticizes actions or decisions made on a third party's part in addition to offering a better solution. It's more to get the readers to see that there is a larger problem at hand.

Persuading: This type is used to move the reader to action, concentrating on solutions, not the problem.

Praising: This format is used to show support for people and organizations in the community that have done something notable.;
, An editorial is a mix of fact and opinion; not solely the writer's opinion, but the opinion of the entire staff. Your fact collection should include objective reporting and research.


A good op-ed needs to contain at least one "point of enlightenment" which can be described as "an observation that is fresh and original."So, get your facts from a number of different sources, pointing out patterns, impending consequences, or a hole in current analysis.
 Typically, editorials are for a fairly quick, captivating read. They are not meant to go on for pages and pages, belaboring the point. Nor are they meant to make the average Joe feel as if he's missed something. Make sure your editorial isn't lengthy or overly esoteric.


Keep it to about 600-800 words.Anything longer and you risk losing your reader. A short, snappy, fiery piece is much more captivating than a wordy lecture.
Eliminate the jargon. Your audience is reading your article for information on something they seek to understand; using technical terms or specific jargon may be off-putting and make your article difficult to take in. Keep the lowest common denominator in mind.

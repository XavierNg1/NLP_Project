 Traditionally, the "luckiest" person to enter a house in the new year is a tall, dark-haired man. If you have a friend or family member fitting that description, ask them to participate. If they're not considerably tall or their hair is medium-dark, that's OK, too. However, it is considered unlucky to choose a red-headed person as a First Foot.;
, These generally include small items that represent the wishes for the new year, i.e. a piece of coal for a warm hearth, bread and salt for all in the house to be fed adequately, a coin for financial prosperity, and a drink (commonly whisky) to represent good cheer.
 Since this can mean being somewhat excluded from the first hoorays and "Happy New Year's!" wishes, you can find a loophole and have everyone else standing inside with the door open and your First Foot outside when midnight strikes. The First Foot may also be accompanied by others (a group could go outside), as long as he is the first to step over the threshold after midnight and some people are inside to open the door.
 Three knocks are traditional, but they can knock however they please.
, The First Foot will then hand the gifts to the keeper(s) of the household and accept a drink (typically whisky) from them to toast with them. All guests may have their glasses filled beforehand to join in the toast (traditionally "Sla√≠nte!"). It is considered unlucky to either not offer the First Foot a drink or for them to decline it. If your First Foot does not drink alcohol, offer a different beverage instead. This is symbolic of accepting blessings and "inviting good luck to stay".

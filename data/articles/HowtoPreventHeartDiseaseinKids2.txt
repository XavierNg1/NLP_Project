 While maintaining your child’s diet is a large part of being able to manage your child’s weight, exercising and being physically fit also play a part. To keep your child at a healthy weight, you can check her body mass index (BMI). To do this:


BMI is measured by the weight (mass) of your child in kilograms divided by the height in mass squared.
The ideal BMI is 18.5 to 25, so a BMI of 25 percent or more means that your child is overweight., One way to help keep your child healthy is to encourage physical activity, rather than sitting around in front of the computer or TV.


Sign your child up for a sports team, or plan fun physical activities for the whole family, like hiking or biking.
 Active children tend to grow up and become active adults. Regular exercise is important because it helps to control your child’s weight; it can also help to boost your child’s self-esteem and confidence. Exercising could include playing sports like soccer or test, running, biking, hiking, swimming, snowboarding, or rock climbing; the possibilities are endless.


If your child has a medical condition that may keep her from exercising as often as she should, work with her doctor to come up with an exercise regimen that takes your child’s condition into account.
 If you are concerned about your child’s weight or heart health, keep track of your child’s physical activities in a log or planner.


Doing this could help you to pinpoint the problem areas, like the fact that your child watches three hours of TV every Saturday morning.
 Smoking can increase your heart rate and tighten the major arteries in your body, making your heart work harder. This could lead to heart disease in the future.If you smoke, make sure to do so far away from your child. You should also seriously consider quitting for your own health.
If you think your child may be smoking, talk to her about the dangers of smoking.

 The one key thing to remember is that you have two types which are wireless and wired.;
, All wireless headsets come uncharged when brought new, much like a mobile phone.
 First make sure your Xbox 360 is on, you can see the display on the television and your controller is synced with the Xbox 360 as player one.
 For older models of the official headset you will have the same method but will have a block to plug in rather than just the pin.
 Press the sync button on the Xbox 360 at the front and simultaneously with the sync button on the wireless headset. The lights on the wireless headset will flash until the circled "one" is solid. This means it has successfully synced to the Xbox 360 and is used for player one.
 As well as this make sure you test to volume as most of the time it will be set to zero.
 You will then see near the controller battery life either the same for the wireless headset or a sound icon for wired.

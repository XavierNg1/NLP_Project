 On many cars, the seat belt sensor is also used to trigger the airbag. Investigate whether this is the case on your car before doing anything drastic to your seat belt alarm.
 Almost all manuals give instructions on how to disarm the seat belt alarm without cutting any wires. This usually consists of doing a series of tasks in the car while parked. As an example, the sequence for turning off the seat belt alarm on a Toyota Camry (2004 and newer) is given below.Insert the key and turn the power on. You should not crank the engine.
There is a knob on your dash panel that toggles your trip and total odometer readings. Press this knob until you see “ODO” on the instrument panel.
You should turn the key off, and then back on.
Hold the same knob for 10-15 seconds. While still holding the knob, put on your seatbelt, and then release the knob.
You should see “B OFF” flash on the instrument panel. This indicates that you turned off your seat belt alarm.
 This may mean following the steps in the owner’s manual for reprogramming your alarm, which, as described above, is often a series of actions taken while the car is parked. Alternatively, you can take the vehicle to your dealer to do this. Some vehicles may have to go to the dealer to be reprogrammed with specific software.


It is worth noting that dealerships are often reluctant to fulfill this request due to legal and liability issues.

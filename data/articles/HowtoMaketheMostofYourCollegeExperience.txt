 The two most important things you should keep organized: your dorm room (if you live in one) and your academic life. Organization for your dorm means knowing where everything is, and keeping things in places that are easy to get to. Academic organization means using a system that allows easy access to your notes and assignments, as well as knowing all your "to-dos" and appointments. This includes using all these worthwhile things: containers, folders, notebooks, book for ideas, book for homework, large yearly calendar to hang on your wall;
, This is for everything really- in life, and especially during college. It goes for lectures, events, parties, etc. It's the one thing that has hugely made my life easier the past few months, but it took me some time to learn. This being said, stuff happens, and if you find yourself being late, just look frazzled, then take a seat and relax or (particularly if it's a professor you know is a stiffer for lateness OR says something at that moment)say "sorry I'm late". If the professor asks why: "I had to speak with my adviser, I had to stay behind my last class, I didn't plan my time well"

 Can you guess where this is going? Procrastination. If you are a procrastinator, the best thing to get on an assignment or project is to start it. That's all. It's about leaning in...Then, keep going (either the same day or over some time). But starting is almost always the icebreaker. You can apply "just do it" to anything you want or need to do.

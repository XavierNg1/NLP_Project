 Moderators are more likely to notice a person who is always mature and courteous, and has sense of humor in the chat.;
, If you are going to be "Don't swear, don't do that" etc. all the time, you are less likely to become a mod. It is usually just annoying, and it's suggested to just be natural in the chat.
 If a person acts like a jerk in the chat, you can report the person via their profile. If the report was good and not a lie, you'll be more respected.
 It drastically decreases the chances of you becoming one, until they forget it (if they do).
 This will make them think you are more mature than a person who is "omg 1337 guise check dis out!!". This part isn't absolutely necessary though, people can become mods even when having mediocre grammar.
 If you are a long-time member of Kongregate, you know things that newer people do not. If they ask something, you should answer them.
 It's okay to mildly swear sometimes, but it isn't okay if you put it towards another user or you have every second word a curse word.

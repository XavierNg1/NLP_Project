 Treats are what will make or break this training exercise. You'll need to find a treat that your chinchilla responds well to, which may take some trial and error. You can use store-bought treats specifically made for chinchillas, or you can use household foods that are safe for chinchillas like raisins.Limit how many treats you give your chinchilla each day. Some treats are okay, but too many can lead to weight gain, tooth decay, and other health problems.
Ask your vet if you're unsure how many treats your chinchilla should have. Your vet will most likely take your pet's size and weight into account.;
, Your chinchilla won't come running the way a dog would, but with a little patience, your pet chinchilla will come to you and climb onto you in response to a treat. However, your chinchilla will need to feel safe and comfortable around you before you can advance to this level of training, which may take time and patience.Hold the treat in one hand and lay your other open hand with your palm facing upwards.
Your open hand should act as a stepping stone for your chinchilla to climb onto you and get the treat.
 Once your chinchilla learns to trust you and feels comfortable climbing into your hand for a treat, you may be able to coax your pet into your hand without food. You may even be able to perch your chinchilla on your shoulder and pet it, though this will take time and practice.

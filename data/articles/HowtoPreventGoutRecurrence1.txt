 Purine is a chemical that is found in most foods. However, foods with high amounts of purine can cause your gout to flare up again. Because of this, try to avoid foods that are high in purine like:


Beer, anchovies, game meat, liver, mussels, livers, and sardines.
Look for foods that are very low in purine like spinach, mushrooms, beans, peas, cauliflowers, lentils, asparagus, red meats, fish, and chicken.;
, Water, dairy products, and coffee can help to dilute the uric acid in your blood. Drink plenty of liquid regularly.
 Being obese can lead to having gout. Because of this, it is important to exercise and keep off any excess weight you may have. Exercising regularly can also help to lower your cholesterol, improve your cardiovascular health, and lower your blood pressure.


Try to exercise for thirty minutes, five times a week., If you have not exercised frequently recently, a training coach can help you to create a regimen that will help you to lose and keep off the weight that may be playing a part in your gout recurrence.
 Stick to a pace that you feel comfortable with when you first begin exercising again; do not push yourself so hard that you injure yourself or lose steam.


For example, begin by walking on a flat surface for 150 minutes each week. The next week, try walking much more quickly for the same amount of time. The following week, try jogging slowly 150 minutes throughout the week., Drinking plenty of water each day will keep you hydrated and will help to dilute the uric acid in your system. Choose water rather than sugary sodas and other carbonated beverages.


While everyone requires a different amount of liquid to stay hydrated, adult males generally need to drink 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water each day, while adult females generally need 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water each day.

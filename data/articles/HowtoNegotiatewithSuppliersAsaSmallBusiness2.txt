 If you can demonstrate to your potential supplier that your company’s needs represent a new, untapped market, the supplier may be interested in reducing its prices to get your business. For example, suppose a paper company has worked primarily with commercial business offices, but you represent a school district. The supplier may be happy to get the school district’s business and might offer you a deal., A contract is not valuable to a supplier if they have to exert significant effort or resources in collecting. When you are negotiating for a better deal, ensure the supplier that you are a strong company and that you pay your bills on time. If you can demonstrate a good credit history or even provide statements from other suppliers you deal with, this may go a long way to helping you generate a better deal., Suppliers want to know that they will have a steady market for their product for some time. If you can commit to a lengthy contract, the supplier may be willing to reduce its prices in order to increase its level of security.Be careful not to tie yourself into too long of a contract, particularly if you are dealing in a volatile market or commodity. If prices or technology change rapidly in your field, you may be doing yourself a disservice by getting tied up in a long deal.
 In negotiating with the supplier, point out any ways that a strong deal will be a “win-win” for both companies. You may be able to pay a higher price, for example, if you can show the supplier that the two of you can work together to maximize deliveries. For example, if your company consists of multiple divisional offices, you might be able to consolidate your ordering to simulate a bulk purchase. This could reduce delivery costs for the supplier in exchange for better service for your company.

 Follow the width of the rug when squeezing out strips of caulk. Lay strips at intervals of about 6 inches (15 cm) for the best grip.


Acrylic-latex caulk is best for this purpose.
Alternatively, you can use a hot glue gun to lay out grippy strips; the process will be essentially the same., Leave the rug in a well ventilated room where it won’t be disturbed. If you have children or pets, you should close the door so the rug isn’t disturbed.


Make sure to wait until the caulk (or glue) is completely dry. Placing the rug on the floor before everything’s dried will cause the rug to stick to the floor and damage it., Once everything’s dried, place the rug down on the floor. If you’d like to test it’s grip, just place your foot on it and try to slide it around. The dried caulk should prevent it from slipping around. If the rug doesn’t have enough grip, you can flip it over and add more strips of caulk with smaller spaces between them.

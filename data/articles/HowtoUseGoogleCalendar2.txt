If you don’t have Google Calendar yet, you can download it for free from the App Store for iOS devices, Google Play for Android, and Windows App Store for Windows phone.
 If you have Google Calendar on the web and want to sync events with the app, just log in using your Google account email and password. The app will automatically sync any events and agendas you already have.
 At the bottom right of the Google Calendar app is a red circle with a + icon. Tap this to begin creating an event. Type the title of the event on the first field. Pick the date of the event in the field below the title, and then add the location of the event under “Add Location” field.


Once you’re done, tap the blue “Save” button at the top right of the screen.
 Locate an event on your calendar quicker by using the search feature. Open the menu (three-bar icon at the top left of the main screen), and tap “Search.” Enter the event name in the search box that appears and the event searched for will be returned in the results. Tap the event to view its details.
 Open an event and look for the pencil symbol at the bottom left. Tap it to open the event editing screen. Edit the event as needed, and tap “Save” to save the changes.
 If you need to delete an event, open its detail page and tap on the editing icon (pencil). At the bottom most part of the editing screen is the delete option. Tap it to delete the event.

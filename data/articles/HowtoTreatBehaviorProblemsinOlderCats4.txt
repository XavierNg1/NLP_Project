 If you are worried about the older cat and its behavior problems seem to be getting worse, bring it to the vet. Tell the vet about any behavior problems you are noticing in the cat. Mention when these problems started and if you suspect there is a specific cause for these issues., The vet will listen to your description of the cat’s behavior problems. They will also do a physical exam on the cat and run any tests, such as a blood test or a urine test, if necessary.They may ask you detailed questions about the cat’s behavior and have you monitor the cat’s behavior moving forward.
Behavior problems in cats can be caused by many things, such as stress, anxiety, aging, or a disruption of its usual routine. The vet will recommend treatment based on the cat’s needs.
 Once the vet has diagnosed the cat and suggested treatment options, you should have a follow up appointment with the vet. The follow up appointment will give you a chance to discuss if the treatment is working for the older cat and if its behavior has improved. Schedule the follow up appointment a few months after you see the vet.

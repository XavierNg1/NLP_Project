 Try to bring dolls with straight hair or with short hair, like Kit Kittredge. It's harder to care for dolls with long curly hair when you're traveling and there is a risk of getting their hair messy from wind, food crumbs, etc.;
, If you do, this means packing more things for them but it's a good idea to let them share clothes or you'll carry too much. The more you take, the easier is to lose things. If you do decide to bring an American girl doll with curly hair and/or if she has a water spray bottle to use, make sure the spray bottle is empty, this way your trip will be comfortable.

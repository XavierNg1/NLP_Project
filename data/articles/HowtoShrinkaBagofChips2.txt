 Get all of the crumbs and other food particles out of the bag. Leaving them in will cause bumps and irregularities in the bag after it shrinks. Dry the bag with a paper towel to help remove leftover particles.


Note that the aluminum lining the inside of most chip bags will cause sparks in the microwave. If you choose to use the microwave to shrink the bag, watch the bag very carefully., Set the microwave setting to “high” and allow the bag to cook for no more than 5 seconds. Keep your eyes on the bag at all times. The bag will likely spark, but should not ignite provided it does not "cook" for more than a few seconds. If the bag ignites into flames, turn off the microwave!, The chip bags will be very hot to the touch. Leave them in the microwave for 3 to 5 minutes before handling them. You may also use oven gloves or tongs to remove the bag if you wish to cool them elsewhere.


Don't try shrinking multiple bags at a time in the microwave. This will increase the amount of time required to shrink each bag, which can lead to a greater risk of the bags igniting into flame.The bags will be small and hard, and generally difficult to shape. The bags become easier to bend if they aren't fully shrunk.
A bag will shrink down to approximately 25% percent of its original size depending on whether you cook it for the fully suggested time, or a lower time.

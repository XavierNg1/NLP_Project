 Some people have had success fixing static hair by using an ionic blow dryer. This blow dryer has negative ions that neutralize the positive ions in your hair to help get rid of static. The ion molecules also break down water molecules in your hair instead of evaporating water molecules, like regular blow dryers. This helps prevent your hair of being stripped of moisture and getting staticky.These blow dryers are not necessarily that expensive and only cost around 20 dollars.;
, Rubbing dryer sheets on your hair can actually help get rid of static hair. You can alternatively rub them on your pillowcase at night instead of your hair.Try keeping your hair brushes wrapped in dryer sheets., Instead of using a plastic comb, try a metal comb. Plastic will make your hair more staticky, but metal is a conductive so it won’t. This means that the electricity goes to the metal first before it goes to your hair, making your hair have less static electricity.Rubber combs or brushes work better than plastic.You can also try using a wooden comb or brush.Use a brush with natural bristles. These brushes are more expensive but help distribute oil in your hair and prevent static., Metal is a conductive so it will help get rid of static. Rub a metal clothes hanger on your hair to help get rid of static electricity. Hold the hanger so it is touching your head and move it slowly downward. Make sure you make contact with every part of your hair., Using a humidifier will make your room moister and eliminate the static problem because the water molecules in the air break up static. If you don’t have a humidifier, simmer water on your stove with a little bit of cinnamon., Instead of using a regular towel to dry your hair, try using a shirt or paper towel. The rough material of a towel can open your hair cuticles which can cause flyaways.When drying your hair squeeze it with your towel, shirt, or paper towel, but don’t rub it.A microfiber towel may also do the trick.

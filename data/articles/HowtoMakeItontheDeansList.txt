 Most professors assign readings. Do them. You don't have to read every line but make sure you grasp the main point of the reading. Even though it might still take forever and you think you might be wasting your time, you will know (and remember) a lot more for your final.;
, Having clear and detailed notes will help you tremendously while studying.
 Unless of course you have a photographic memory and remember everything right when you write it down. But I doubt it.
 The only way you will remember all the information is when you make the appropriate connections in your brain. That can only happen if you are absolutely clear about the material your professor is covering. (Or at least the material that will be on the exam.) So don't hesitate just ask. Others will learn from your questions as well.
 Just because you are a friendly person doesn't mean you will get an A but knowing your professor helps. As much as some of them don't show it...they care! Get to know the way your professor thinks and show them that you care about the class as well. If you have questions or want to review your professor's office is the best place to go.
 Even if you're a genius, this step will be necessary. Find your learning style and use appliances such as flash cards, study guides, review sessions and intelligent friends.
 It doesn't mean you have to give up your social life or sports. It just means that you have to learn how to manage your time successfully.
 Make sure you realize that your grades in college will influence whoever you will turn out to be. High school is pass√©. It's time to show people your true potential.

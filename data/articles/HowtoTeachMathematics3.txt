 Students are going to follow your lectures more if they see you using certain technological tools. You should become aware of what materials your classroom provides and be able to use them correctly. Some of these may include:Smartboards

Computer projectors

Programmed slide shows (PowerPoint, etc.)


, Students are surrounded by technology, and they should be encouraged to use the tools that are available to them. In teaching math, you need to combine adequate memorization and understanding along with the use of technology. Students should be taught to use such tools as:Graphing calculators

Smartboards

iPads and other tablet accessories 


, Students who habitually forget to write down homework assignments or who lose or forget their notebooks can be encouraged to enter assignments into their cell phone calendars. This is more likely to assure that the assignment at least makes its way home. You can also encourage your students to do their homework if you allow the use of certain support apps. Research the Internet for a wide variety of math homework apps that you might recommend to your students.Homework apps, if used improperly, can cut into student learning. But if you research the apps carefully and direct your studentsâ€™ work, you can make the most of the available tools.

MetaCalculator and WolframAlpha are two useful apps you may want to investigate.
 Particularly in teaching math, you need to ask if the apps are adding to the learning experience or taking away from it. There are some apps, such as one called Photomath, that will actually show students the answers to their homework problems. While this could look like cheating, you need to require that students be able to explain their answers and the steps they perform. In this way, students who need help at home can use the app for guidance. In the end, however, they should know that you will be checking for their overall understanding.

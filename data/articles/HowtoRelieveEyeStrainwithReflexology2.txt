 This point is directly at the base of your skull. It is directly in the middle. Massaging this point with the tips of your fingers helps some with eye fatigue.You can also try placing just the tip of your middle finger on this point and applying gentle pressure, as you tip your head backward to help apply that pressure. You can also use your thumb.This point supposedly helps with most areas of the head, including the eyes.
 This location is actually two pressure points on the back of your neck. Find the base of the skull (where the wind mansion is), then move an inch down. Now, move an inch out on each side into the muscles at the back of your neck. Gently massaging each of these spots with your middle finger helps some people with eyestrain.You can also apply pressure similar to the method for the wind mansion, except use both of your middle fingers.
 Another place to massage is at the base of your three middle fingers--your ring finger, middle finger, and index finger. Use your thumb to massage where the knuckle meets your hand. You can also massage just above that knuckle, as well. Flip your hand over to massage on the other side, too.Use a thumb roll to apply pressure. Press down using your thumb pad. Let it roll down or up the knuckle as you bend your thumb. Move about 1/8 of an inch up and down as you bend and straighten your thumb., This spot is on the top of your foot. You'll find it down the foot a bit, where the big toe meets the little toe. You need to find the webbing. It's not actually between the toes but on the top. Massage the area gently with your finger tips.To make it easier, you can also use the heel of your other foot to gently press into this point for 30 seconds.

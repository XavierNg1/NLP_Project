A long bathing suit or skirt can become attached to the side of the pool or the railings on the ladders of the pool.
Make sure that the waist of the suit is not too tight because this can harm the skin. One way to make sure the bathing suit you buy for your child fits appropriately is to choose a bathing suit with elastic that can be adjusted to the childâ€™s specific shape.
 Just like when you feel uncomfortable when you wear a bathing suit that is not your personal style and that does not fit you well, your child will likely feel the same way about her bathing suit.


Both girls and boys can be self-conscious about their bodies and it is important to make sure that they feel good in what they are wearing and that it is not fashionably out of date.
Keep in mind that if you buy a bathing suit made of lighter colors, these colors will fade very quickly from the sun, chlorine and salt water. This can make the bathing suit look old and worn. It may be a good idea to buy brighter colors to prolong the life of the suit.

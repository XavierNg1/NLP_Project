 Each year, thousands of children are kidnapped by a parent and removed from the United States.Once a parent escapes the country with a child, it becomes much more difficult to locate the parent and return the child to the U.S. In addition, U.S. Customs and Border Protection does not screen outbound travelers, so the parent and child are unlikely to be stopped before the leave the country.Ask to file a missing person’s report and to have the victim’s name entered into the National Crime Information Center database.You might not want to file criminal charges against the parent before the child has been returned.The threat of criminal charges might cause the parent to take more extreme action to avoid prosecution.
 If you suspect that the parent might flee the country with the child, advise law enforcement of this possibility. You might be particularly suspicious of this possibility if the parent has ever discussed or threatened leaving the United States, if he or she has ties to a foreign country, or if the parent is in possession of the child’s passport. The police will contact the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s National Targeting Center. The Targeting Center will post a bulletin alerting agencies of the possibility of an international abduction., If the parent successfully removes your child from the country, contact the U.S. State Department’s Office of Children’s Issues for help at 1-888-407-4747. The Office of Children’s Issues can do the following to aid in the return of your child:


Assist you with the return of your child from a country that is a Hague Abduction Convention partner;
Put you in contact with attorneys in the country where your child is located;
Work with local and federal law enforcement; and
Help you connect with any other organizations and government agencies that may be able to help.

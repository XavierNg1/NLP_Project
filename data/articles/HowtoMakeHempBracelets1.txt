 Cut 2 long pieces of hemp about 5 feet (1.5Â m) long. Match the ends up and fold both pieces in half. Tie a knot at the fold.

, It helps to tape the loop left from the knot onto a table or safety pin to a chair or the knee of your jeans. This will give you some leverage as you create the pattern of knots in the bracelet.
 You should have four strands of hemp. For this type of knot, the two center strands will remain together, while the outer strands will be moving around.
 Take the strand on the left and cross it across the two middle strands to create a "4" shape.
 Take the strand on the right and cross it over the tail end of the first strand from the left. Then, pull the strand over and under, up through the loop in the "4" that was created.
 Make sure that all your knots are of an even tightness throughout the bracelet to create a level pattern.
 Use the same method as explained above to tie a knot starting on the right instead of the left. Each knot should move from the leftmost strand to the rightmost strand to create a flat (rather than a spiral) bracelet.
 Tie knots back and forth until it reaches a point long enough to wrap around the entirety of your wrist.
 When you reach your stopping point, tie a basic knot at the end of the bracelet. Cut off any excess hemp, and use the knot and the loop on the opposite end to secure the bracelet to your wrist. Enjoy!

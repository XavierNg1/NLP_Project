 You should have one figure of which the side lengths are given or measurable. If you cannot determine the side lengths of the figure, you cannot make a similar figure.

For example, you might have a right triangle with sides measuring 4 cm and 3 cm, and a hypotenuse 5 cm long.
 If you are scaling up, your missing figure will be larger, and the scale factor will be a whole number, improper fraction, or decimal. If you are scaling down your missing figure will be smaller, and your scale factor will most likely be a proper fraction.

For example, if the scale factor is 2, then you are scaling up, and the similar figure will be larger than the one you have.
 The scale factor should be given to you. When you multiply the side length by the scale factor, this gives you the missing corresponding side length on the similar figure.For example, if the hypotenuse of a right triangle is 5 cm long, and the scale factor is 2, to find the hypotenuse of the similar triangle, you would calculate 5×2=10{\displaystyle 5\times 2=10}. So the similar triangle has a hypotenuse that is 10 cm long.
 Continue to multiply each side length by the scale factor. This will give you the corresponding side lengths of the missing figure.

For example, if the base of a right triangle is 3 cm long, with a scale factor of 2, you would calculate 3×2=6{\displaystyle 3\times 2=6} to find the base of the similar triangle. If the height of a right triangle is 4 cm long, with a scale factor of 2 you would calculate 4×2=8{\displaystyle 4\times 2=8} to find the height of the similar triangle.

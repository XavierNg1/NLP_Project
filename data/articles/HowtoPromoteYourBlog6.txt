 Even if you aren’t posting a blog update, you should be actively involved in your blogging community. Every minute that you’re not promoting yourself is another minute without new readers.
 Come up with a plan of action for each day. Make sure you have attainable goals, such as write two pages of content and find three blogs in your niche. You may not always meet your goals for the day, but striving towards them will keep you active in the blogging community and ensure that your blog is always growing.
 Try to make direct contact with other bloggers and readers. Shoot for making 100 connections per day. This will keep you focused on networking and building your community. You may not actually achieve 100 connections, but trying every day will dramatically increase your network.

 Just because it's dry doesn't mean it can't go bad! Be sure to check the expiration date on dried marjoram you purchase.
 Unlike fresh, you should add dried marjoram at the beginning of the recipe unless explicitly directed otherwise.


Use less dried marjoram than fresh, as the flavor is stronger.
 Store dried marjoram in a tightly closed container in a cool, dark place. Use home dried marjoram within one year.

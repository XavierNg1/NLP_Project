 Take this time away from friends and family to work on your physical fitness. Exercise will help improve your mood and may distract you from feeling stuck in the hospital. Some hospitals may have outdoor space you can take advantage of to work out. If there isn't any outdoor space or a designated fitness room, ask a staff member to show you the best place to do some exercise.
 Reading novels may improve brain health and increase empathy. Discovering the joy of reading may set you up with a healthy habit to continue after being discharged.


Reading self help books may be a good idea, given the circumstances, and may improve mood.
 Some hospitals may have classes you can participate in or structured activities, like crafting. Take advantage of these opportunities to learn something new or find a new hobby. Pass the time doing something interesting to make your stay more bearable.


If the hospital does not offer classes or structured activities, you can request art supplies and books directing you how to create with different mediums.

 If you want to use it, make sure that you and your partner have the exact same dictionary, or else your "language" would be totally ruined. A more advanced dictionary works best because it has more words.;
, Now is time to understand the code. Open your dictionary to a random page into the middle. Since dictionary's are usually printed in 2 columns, you will have to adjust the code from the book code. Enter the first numbers (triple digit, unless you have a dictionary that has 1000+ pages). There should be 3 or 4 numbers in your code right now, depending on your dictionary. Now, search your actual word in a column. The columns can be numbered 1 or 2, so if you are using a dictionary, and you found the page and column, it should look like this: 435(for page)1(for column)...so it would be 4351.
 You search the word in the column and when you found it, see if it is the first word, the second word, etc. This will be your final numbers (double-digit(e.g. isolationism is word 21 in the first column on page 435; that means the code is 435121)).
 It must have 6 or 7 digits or else it won't be the dictionary code.
 Use your dictionary, record the page, column, and find your word. This may take a little while, but when you get used to it, it can be an effective code. Below is an example of some words printed in dictionary code from the Webster's Universal College Dictionary.

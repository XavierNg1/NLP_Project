 This button is also referred to as the "Tools" button, and it is located to the far right of the address bar at the top of your browser.


The graphic for the button looks like a small wrench.
 This choice should be located near the bottom of the "Tools" or "Customize" drop-down menu.


The "Options" option is located at the top of the sixth section and is the thirteenth option overall.
If using a Mac instead of a PC, look for the word "Preferences" instead of "Options."

, The "Options" or "Preferences" dialogue box should pop up. Click on the final tab in this dialogue box, labelled "Under the Hood" or "Under the Bonnet."


Note the two subsections of this tab: "Privacy" and "Network."

,


Clicking on the "Clear browsing data..." button should open up yet another dialogue box.
 Underneath the heading "Obliterate the following items," select the box next to the "Empty the cache" button.


Do not select any of the other checkboxes unless you also want to clear those other options.
Note that options vary slightly in older versions of Chrome when compared to newer versions. The only other options you have are "Clear browsing history," "Clear download history," "Delete cookies and other site data," "Clear saved passwords," and "Clear saved form data."

, Beneath the checkboxes is the statement, "Clear data from this period." Select "Everything" from the drop-down menu next to this statement in order to clear your entire cache.


Other options include "Last day," "Last week," and "Last 4 weeks."

, This button is located in the lower right corner of the "Clear Browsing Data" dialogue box. Clicking it will finalize the process.


As with newer versions, there is no "undo" option. In other words, this step is final.

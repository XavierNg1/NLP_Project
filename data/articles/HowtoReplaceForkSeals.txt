Loosen the 2 bolts that secure the fork legs to the frame and the caps upon each leg. Then loosen the brake caliper bolts and the whole front axle of the bike.
Put the bike in gear and chock the rear wheel.
Raise the front wheel off the ground as far as needed.
Remove the brake calipers, fender, front wheel and any other hanging cables.;
,


Loosen the bolts further and pull downward on the fork while twisting.
Remove the fork cap carefully. Because it is spring loaded, be careful not to stand in the way of the cap as you remove it.
Take out the spring and let the oil drain into a bucket
Free the damper rod by inserting a tool into the cavity to reach it.
Memorize the assembly of the fork's springs, washers and spacers for easy re-installation later.



Wedge the dust seal from the fork leg.
Find the fork seal itself. It is held into place by a clip within a groove.
Pry the seal out carefully.
Flush the area as you go to remove debris within the fork.
Take the tube in 1 hand and the stanchion in the other. Use muscle to pull the 2 apart. You will see the seal coming out of hiding as you do this.



Remove all rust and repair imperfections that led to the old seal's leakage.
Soak a cloth with oil and work on the area where the seal rested.



Rub oil on the inner part of the new seal.
Put the seal over the stanchion and slide it down into place.
Set the seal with a seal driver. This will tap the seal into place gently but firmly.



Situate the clip and dust seal back onto the fork. Place the damping rod back inside.
Pour new oil into the fork, measuring the height as necessary.
Re-install the spring and screw on the fork cap. Tighten the bolts.

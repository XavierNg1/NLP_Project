 If you're not confident, you won't be able to have a drop of girl swag -- not even if you steal Nicki Minaj's entire wardrobe. The first step toward having the right attitude for swag is just to be comfortable in your own skin. Everyone who sees you or talks to you for a minute should know that you love who you are, who you're with, and where you are. If you show confidence, people will trust that you know what you're doing when you pick your swagtastic outfits and show off your moves on the dance floor.


Have the right body language. Strut into a room with your head high and your posture straight, looking ready for what's ahead for you.
Wherever you are, look like you want to be there. Don't check your phone every two seconds or look around for somebody better to talk to -- you should look like you're exactly where you want to be.
Don't spend your time examining your makeup or adjusting your clothes in the mirror. This will make it look like you're not happy about the way you look.;
, If you really have girl swag, then you're so happy with who you are and how you look that you don't care if people think you're too loud or look ridiculous. Just be yourself and let the haters hate. If you spend all of your time trying to suck up to people, dressing like all of your friends, or asking people if you look good, then you'll just look insecure.


There's a difference between not caring what people think and being catty or mean. You should still treat people with respect -- just stop trying to please them and meet another person's standards of beauty or of how a girl should act.
 There's no way you can rock a killer outfit if you hate the way you look or are trying to cover up your curves. You don't have to have a perfect body to recognize that every girl is unique and to find the parts of your body you love the most and be proud to show them off. If you wear bulky clothes to cover yourself up, keep your arms folded across your chest, or generally try to hide how fabulous you look, then you'll never be able to love and accept your body. If you never accept your body, it means you aren't confident.
 There is no one outfit or uniform that means you have swag. Having swag just means being comfortable with your own style, and wearing whatever makes you feel good. Find an original style that works for you, and have fun experimenting with clothes that take you out of your comfort zone. The important thing is that you act like you love what you're wearing, instead of asking your friends if you look ridiculous, or trying to rearrange your hair or outfits in the middle of the day because you think you look too crazy.
 If you really have swag, then you're cool enough to be comfortable with anyone, not just trying to social climb and only talk to the people who will make you look better. A true sign of a girl with swag is that she can strike up a conversation with anyone, be comfortable meeting new people, and make almost anyone laugh or smile.


When you meet a girl, don't look her up and down, but be friendly while maintaining your cool. This will make you have much more swag than being stuck up and afraid or jealous of new people.

 Tropical flowers come in subdued, pastel shades and some brighter, bolder colors. Before you choose your colors, decide which color scheme you prefer – this will help you select your flowers.For example, pale tropical flowers include the African moon (a small, white daisy), the Amazon lily, begonias, cattleya, frangipani, and lotus flowers. Many of these flowers come in colors other than white, but they are more subdued hues.Vividly colored tropical flowers include crab claws, African tulips, angel wing begonias, blanket flowers, bottle brush flowers, and chrysanthemums.;
, Are you going for a big, statement bouquet or something with smaller buds? Big is better for a large, loose bouquet, while smaller flowers look best in a gathered bouquet.The African tulip, cautleya, catasetum, bottle brush, and decorative dalia flowers are all larger tropical flowers.
Smaller tropical flowers include chrysanthemums, constantia, and frangipani.
 Depending on where you live, it can be expensive to order fresh tropical flowers. Asking your florist which are in bloom and likely to be cheaper can help you save money.A good way to avoid this – and save money – is to buy fake flowers. Keep in mind, however, that while this is a money-saving option, you’ll probably have less variety to choose from.

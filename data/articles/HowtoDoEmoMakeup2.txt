 Only use enough foundation or concealer to hide imperfections. Don't make it look obviously done. Emo makeup on boys is usually a bit more subtle than on girls.
Most Emo guys don't wear foundation or concealer but it can be a good technique if you have blemishes or scars.
If using concealer, use the stick form as it goes on evenly and blends well. Tap your fingertips or use a concealer brush to blend it.
 Put it carefully onto your lash line in one continuous line to give a smooth final result. Keep the line as close to your lashes as possible.
The amount of eyeliner you apply depends on personal preference so try out different looks at home to find one you like.
You can use a liquid liner to define and clean up the edge of your eyeliner.
 This is optional but if you decide to apply eyeshadow then try to use a light amount and stay away from bright neon colours.


Charcoal eyeshadow is a good choice.
You should put a little bit of eyeshadow under the eye.
Boy Emo makeup is usually less dramatic than this same style on girls, though personal preference may change this.
 You should always use black mascara when completing an Emo look.It is not recommended for boys to curl their eyelashes as this creates too much of a feminine effect.
It is quite acceptable for boys and men to apply makeup. Many famous rockstars use makeup on a regular basis.
The amount of eyeliner and mascara used on boys may come down to personal preference rather than gendered standards.

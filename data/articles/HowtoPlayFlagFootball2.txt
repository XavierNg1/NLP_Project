 For a full-length game, plan for an hour of total playing time. Divide the game into four quarters, with 15 minutes to each quarter. For a quicker match, feel free to shorten the overall time.Simply divide that time into four equal quarters. Or, for a very short game, simply have two short halves of ten minutes each.Also, decide how long of a break you will have between each quarter and half. The break between the second and third quarter (halftime) is typically the longest. The other two breaks are of equal length.Break times vary from league to league in football.Halftime can be anywhere from five to twelve minutes.Breaks between quarters are usually one or two minutes.

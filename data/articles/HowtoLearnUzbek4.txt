 If you have the ability to travel through Central Asia, the best place you can learn and apply Uzbek is in Uzbekistan itself. Uzbekistan is country rich in culture, art, history, and hospitality. Again, do your homework and find what works for you.
 Language is more than just words and syntax, it is woven intricately with history and culture. While or before you learn Uzbek, immerse yourself in as much information as you can about the Uzbek peoples and traditions. The more informed you are, the better you will understand the subtleties of Uzbek.

 For some dogs, the pheromone will be enough to help them manage their bad behavior and anxiety. For other dogs, however, pheromones won't work or will not be enough treatment.You need to assess whether the pheromones are working and, if they are not, decide how to proceed.


If you don't feel that the pheromones are having a positive impact on your dog's anxiety level then you can discontinue their use. There is no need to continue to pay for a treatment that is not effective for your particular pet.
 Pheromones sometimes work best when used in combination with other efforts to help the animal. If you do not feel that the pheromone therapy alone is helping your dog enough, then you should continue to look for additional solutions to its anxiety. It may be that pheromones alone won't solve your dog's problems but a combination of tactics will help it immensely.


For example, if your dog is being destructive in the house, it may need a combination of training, more exercise, and pheromone therapy to help alleviate its issues. In fact, using pheromones while working on training may calm the dog in a way that helps it to absorb the training more effectively., If the pheromones don't work, don't give up. Take your dog back to its veterinarian or discuss the problems you are having with a professional animal behaviorist. They may be able to suggest other treatments that could work for your dog. If the anxiety is very strong, then your veterinarian may even suggest the alternative of giving your dog a prescription anti-anxiety medication instead of pheromone therapy.

Alternative View:
, Cut the rope a foot long or so (30cm). Pass the ends through holes in the flaps. Tie the ends in a knot.
 Make a loop that is only slightly larger than the case. Pass through the holes as shown. Slide loop to open. Slide loop to make "handles".
Alternative View (Handles made by sliding the rope through holes):
, Sew the hem edge of a large tee-shirt closed. Slide the case in through the neck opening and use the sleeve openings as your handles., Leave largish flaps of cardboard at the box opening. Roll the flaps to form "scroll like" handles. Tape well.

 Use traditional all-purpose flour and pour it into a large mixing bowl. The flour will act as the base of the bait and will help bind everything together., Slowly pour warm water into the flour and mix the flour with a whisk or fork. Eventually, the flour should start to stick together and harden into a dough., Sprinkle flour onto the palms of your hands and start to work the dough into a ball. If the mixture has become too sticky or wet, you can add more flour to the bowl to thicken the bait., Place the dough ball onto a square of wax paper and lay another piece of wax paper over it. Press down on the dough so that it flattens out on the wax paper. Continue to work it down until it forms into a 1/2-inch (1.27 cm) thick sheet., Place the wax paper in a standard microwave and heat it for 30 seconds. During this time the dough should harden and become less sticky. Once it's done microwaving, pull it out to see it's ready by rolling some of the dough in between your fingers to see if it's hardened.If the dough is too sticky, nuke it for another 10-15 seconds.
 Once the dough is tough and crusty, you can take it out of the microwave and roll it up into 1/4 inch (.635 cm) balls. This bait is durable and won't dissolve in the water as you fish.
 If you're not using your bait balls immediately, you can cover them in plastic wrap and keep them in the refrigerator for about a week. If the balls are too hard when you pull them out, add a couple drops of water to them and microwave them for another ten seconds.

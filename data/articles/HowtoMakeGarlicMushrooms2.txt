 Make sure that the rack is positioned in the middle.
 Be sure to scrub the tops well to get rid of any excess dirt. Don't worry too much about the stems; you will be cutting them off shortly.
 Try to cut the stems as close to the cap as possible. You can also peel the mushrooms to reveal the feathered underside; this will create a "bowl" for the butter and garlic to sit in.
 Make sure that the stem part is facing upwards. Try to arrange the mushrooms side-by-side. This will help keep them stable and prevent them from tipping over.
 You can do this by chopping the garlic into fine pieces with a sharp knife, or by using a garlic press.
 You can do this in a small saucepan over the stove over low to medium heat. You can also place them in a microwave-safe dish, and heat them for 30 seconds.
 Be careful not to spill any of the garlic butter onto the baking or casserole dish.
 How much you use is up to you. If you are making this for a group of people, it might be better to limit the salt and pepper; this way, your guests can season the mushrooms to their personal tastes.
 As the mushrooms roast, the garlic butter will seep onto the bottom of the dish. Every so often, you will want to baste the mushrooms with this melted garlic butter. Use a turkey baster to pump the garlic butter from the bottom of the dish, and to squirt it over the mushrooms., You can transfer them to individual plates, or to a new serving platter. They can be served on their own as an appetizer, or alongside a main course, such as chicken or steak.

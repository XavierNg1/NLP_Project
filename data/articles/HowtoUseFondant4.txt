 The grid squares should add up to make the exact same size as the motif you're making. (This means that using pre-drawn graph paper may not always work out.) A simple method is to determine the size of the motif, draw a box to that size, then use a ruler to measure evenly to divide the square into grid boxes.


If you're upsizing an original motif, then the number of squares need to match the original amount on the smaller motif.
 Either copy with existing grid motif or copy in an image you like.


You can skip using the squares if the image you like can be printed, cut out and is simple enough to work over the top of without gridding. Be aware though that it's usually easier to work a grid design when shaping the fondant pieces.

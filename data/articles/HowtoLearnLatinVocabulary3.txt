 Inserting foreign words into English sentences helps with quickly learning the meaning of each word. This technique is known as diglot weave . Come up with different sentences and replace one word at a time with a Latin vocabulary word leaving the rest of the sentence in English. Repeat this, replacing different words within the sentence, until you’ve mastered each word.
 Place a label on the things that are around (wall, window, chair, computer, etc.) with a Post-It note of the word and its meaning on opposite sides. Read both sides of the label until you’ve committed it to memory.


When you’ve memorized the word, remove and gather the Post-It notes. Match each vocabulary word with its item.
Practice daily and revise your labeled notes with different items. Whenever you walk past a Post-It note, test yourself.
 The easiest way to remember what you’ve learned is by teaching and sharing with others. Strike up conversations with those around you. Insert the words that you’ve learned into those conversations. Use the diglot weave technique if you’re still working on forming complete sentences.

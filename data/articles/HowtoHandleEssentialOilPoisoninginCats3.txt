 Cats are natural explorers. But if your cat ingests, inhales, or otherwise comes in contact with concentrated essential oils, the poisoning that results will be swifter and more serious. Therefore, lock your essential oils away in a high, out-of-the-way cabinet that your furry friend is unlikely to get into.If your essential oil bottles exude a significant scent even without being sprayed, place them in a resealable plastic bag, then stash them in your locked cabinet.
 If you spray essential oils in a room, place your cat in another room and do not allow it to enter the space where you sprayed the essential oils until the scent has dissipated. To prevent the possibility of low-level buildup, do not use oils for more than two weeks at a time. Wait at least one week before resuming your use of essential oils.Use these same rules for liquid potpourri, hydrosols, scented cleaning products, and other concentrated sprays.
You can accelerate the dissipation of essential oils by opening a window or turning on a fan.
 Cats are especially sensitive to essential oils containing polyphenolic compounds (or “phenols”). These include oils like:Thyme
CitronellaClove
Eucalyptus
Birch
Cinnamon
Melaleuca
Wintergreen / peppermint
Tea tree
Lemon

 Start taking your kids to the dentist at an early age so that they get comfortable with their dentist and are not afraid.Make sure you select a dentist who has worked with many kids before, since this will make it easier for both you and your children to trust their dentist.


Your pediatric dentist should have a clinic that is suitable for kids as well. It should feel welcoming and child-friendly. Avoiding traumatic or scary visits to the dentist when your child is young will actually help ensure their oral health as adults, as they will be less likely to fear going to the dentist.
 It’s important to start taking your child to the dentist regularly while they’re still young. This will encourage them to trust their dentist, and to feel comfortable around the dental equipment.Taking your child to the dentist early and often will allow your dentist to frequently assess their general oral health and catch any cavities or other problems as soon as they develop.
 Especially before your child’s first trip to the dentist, avoid any use of words like “shot,” “hurt,” “drill,” and “pain.”These terms may needlessly frighten children, and make the dentist visit worse than it would otherwise be. When explaining to your child why they need to see a dentist, or what the dentist will do in their mouth, explain the visit with optimistic terms. Say something like:


“The dentist just wants to count your teeth and make sure your smile is bright.”
“The dentist is going to open your mouth and have a look inside.”

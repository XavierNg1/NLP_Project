 If it's origami paper, start with the white side up. Fold it in half diagonally both ways. Then, unfold.






;
, This is called a blintz fold.
, This is called a book or greeting card fold. Then, unfold.
 This is called a cupboard fold. Do not unfold this.
 Pull them up and pinch them so they stick up. Then pull them down to the middle so that the shape appears as in the image.
 Repeat step eight on the unfolded side.
, It's finished!








, Here are some ideas for using your origami pinwheel:










Make a pinwheel: find a pushpin and a chopstick/pencil. Push the pushpin through the paper and into the chopstick or pencil and it looks like a real pinwheel. If you leave room on the pushpin for the wheel to slide back and forth and you blow, it works like a real one.
Garden decoration: These origami pinwheels look pretty in the garden. They'll last until it rains, or keep them sheltered.
Cards: Glue the origami pinwheel to cards. Either draw a stick or glue on a thin stick to create a 3D pinwheel effect on the card. Or be imaginative and use the pinwheel to create other designs on the card, such as a windmill, a Ferris wheel, etc.
Festive decorations: Tie a row of origami pinwheels together along a piece of string or ribbon and hang for festive effect. Try using different colors of paper for best effect, or use colors that are themed to the occasion.
Gift boxes: Attach an origami pinwheel to a gift box as the "seal" or as a design feature. Pinwheels could also be attached to gift wrapping paper for a 3D effect.

,, You can use stencils or free-style it — just make sure your designs are easy to cut out!


You can also use stickers whose shapes you like, as long as don't mind throwing them away.
 Be sure to stick them to the outside of the jar.
 Ensure that you’ve sprayed the jar evenly, and that you’ve covered the designs that you’ve stuck to the jar.
 Make sure it’s completely dry before you move to the next step. It may take less than 10 minutes to dry, depending on the spray.


The drying time should be clearly stated on the back of the spray can.
If you’re unsure of whether the spray is dry, touch the glass. It should feel dry.
 Once the glass frosting spray is completely dry, you can remove the adhesive designs.


This will leave you with a frosted glass lantern with clear spots where the designs were.
 To keep the candle stationary, you can nestle it into some sand, sea salt, or epsom salt.
 If you want to hang your lantern, you’ll need to add a handle. To make a handle:


To determine the length you need, wrap a piece of strong wire around the mouth of the jar, just beneath the ridges where the lid would screw on. Next, pull the wire upwards and loop it over the jar to the desired size of the handle that you want, then cut the wire.
Wrap one end of the wire around the jar’s mouth, bend the wire up as if making a handle, and then secure the end of the wire to the start of the handle by bending it into a loop with pliers.
Bend the free end of the wire into a handle and then secure it to the wire that sits around the jar’s mouth, on the other end of the jar, by using pliers to bend it into a loop around that wire.

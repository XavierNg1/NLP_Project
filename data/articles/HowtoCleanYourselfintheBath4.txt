 The floor might be wet as well as your feet so you need to be extra careful to prevent yourself from falling. Also, your blood pressure might be slowed down and you could get a head rush when you stand up. Pull the plug and pour cold water in to gradually bring your core temperature down then slowly stand.If you can, hold on to something stable as you stand up.
 If you have dry skin, you may want to rinse off with clean water from the faucet to get off any soap residue from your bath. You can do this by filling up a cup and repeatedly pouring water over your body. You can also turn on the shower to have a quick rinse.


If you decide to use the shower, wait until at least half of the bath water drains out so water doesn't splash on the floor and the tub won't over flow.
 Put a towel around yourself to soak up the water left on your skin. To keep your head warm and dry your hair, take another towel and wrap it around your head. This will help prevent additional water from dripping on the floor that you could slip on.


Pat yourself dry and apply lotion or cream to your body and face to help moisturize your skin(optional).
 Just unplug the bath tub, put everything back and wipe up any spills or footprints. You can also spray an after shower cleaner that doesn't involve any wiping and will help keep your tub clean.


Natural cleaning products that don't use chemicals are safe to use and better for the environment.

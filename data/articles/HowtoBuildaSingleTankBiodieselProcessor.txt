Cut a large opening (about half the top) in the top of the steel drum. You may also be able to find a drum with the top already removed.
Drill a 1.5-inch hole in the bottom of the drum. You will attach a pipe to it shortly.
Weld the 1.5-diameter pipe in the hole at the bottom of the drum.
Attach the 1.5-inch brass ball valve to the pipe. This is the drain valve. Brass is not necessary, but it offers the greatest durability.
Drill a hole in the side of the drum at the bottom, same size as the heater element. You can find heater elements in old hot water heaters or purchase them at a hardware store.
Fit the heater element properly, making sure it is not touching the side of the drum.
Wire up the heater element.



Attach one pulley to the rolled steel rod.
Attach the other pulley to the spindle of the electric motor.
Weld the propeller to the other end of the rolled steel rod. You can use cheap shelf brackets as propellers.
Attach the rod, pulley and propeller assembly to one side of the hinge. This will allow you to be able to move the propeller/mixer when necessary.
Weld a piece of angle iron across the top of the drum. This angle iron (or similar) offers support for the mixing apparatus.
Weld the unattached side of the hinge to the angle iron so the propeller and rod assembly sits in the middle of the drum. The hinge should swing the propeller and rod back and forth.
Mount the electric motor on the side of the drum. You should be able to mount the motor directly to the drum without it tipping the drum (unless your motor is from an old Cadillac or something).
Fit the belt to the pulleys and tighten by wedging a block of wood into the hinge. A tight belt is necessary to mix the biodiesel.
 The measurement stick will aid in processing biodiesel.

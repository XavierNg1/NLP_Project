 Sugary stuff is great, but remember to have other options e.g. pizza, crackers or even fruit because sometimes at 3:00am you might not feel like chocolate or other sugary foods. Remember to check if your guests are vegetarian or vegan or have allergies because a trip to the hospital at 2:00am because Molly ate a Snickers when she has nut allergies will definitely put a damper on the night., For example maybe if you see some blueberry fizzy juice at your local super market. Even if you all hate it, it could still come in handy for penalties in truth of dare. Once again remember to check if your guests have allergies.

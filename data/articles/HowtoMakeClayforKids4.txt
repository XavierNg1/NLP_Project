 You'll need:









2 slices white bread
4 tablespoons white glue
Paint for coloring, optional.
 Cut or tear off the crusts from the bread and throw the crusts away.
 Smaller pieces of bread will make kneading the clay easier. Place your bread pieces in a small bowl.
 Mix the bread and glue together thoroughly with a large spoon.
 Add a couple of drops and stir well. Always add small amounts until you get the desired color.
 The glove will keep your hand clean and dry.
 When the bread clay starts to form into a mass, remove it from the bowl. Knead it with the gloved hand until it stops being sticky.
 Knead the clay ball with both hands. When it forms a ball, it's ready for using in your project.
 Clay can keep for a few weeks, if well sealed and kept in the refrigerator.

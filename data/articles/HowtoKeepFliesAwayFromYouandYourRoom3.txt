 Sealing up your room will help you save energy and to keep flies away. Check the weather stripping and caulking around your windows and doors to make sure it doesn't have cracks in it, and replace it if it's necessary. Check for leaks in any pipe entryways, like in your air conditioning unit. Fill any gaps you find with a can of expandable foam., Check your screens for holes or tears -- even if they're tiny, they may still be big enough to let in flies. Replace them, or cover them with tape for a temporary solution, and see what a difference it makes. Make sure that the edges of the screens fit snugly and that there's no space for the flies to pass through.

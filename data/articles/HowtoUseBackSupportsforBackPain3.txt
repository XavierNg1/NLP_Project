 Ask your doctor what areas of your back would most benefit from a back support. Lifting back braces are made in small and large models. Some involve a tapered belt to allow you to twist, while others restrict twisting motions.
 Back or spine injuries can be very serious. Exacerbating a spine injury can lead to paralysis. To avoid this, always listen to your doctorâ€™s instructions and follow his/her recommendations closely.


Take prescribed medication at its correct dose and time.
Full rest is not advisable. It's important to move within pain tolerance as much as you can.
Perform regular physical therapy exercises (if so prescribed).
 Rest while flat on your back, ice the affected area and take an anti-inflammatory while you recover. It is especially important to see a doctor, if you must return to a job that involves physical labor, to rule out non-muscular spinal problems.

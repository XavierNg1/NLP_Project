 Recuva is a file recovery program that has a free version available for home use. It is Windows only, and has a graphical interface instead of using the command prompt. You can download Recuva from the Piriform website.


Make sure to choose the Free version when selecting your download.
Most users can leave the installation settings at their default.
 Ensure that the card has been inserted into your computer's card reader, or that the card is inserted in a camera and the camera is connected to your computer via USB.
 When you start up Recuva and click past the Welcome screen, you will be shown a list of options for what types of files you want to search for. Choose the category that best suits your needs, or click the Other option to manually select all the file types you want to search for.
 On the next screen, you will be asked where Recuva should look for files. Choose the "On my media card or iPod" option and click Next.
 On the next screen, you will be given the option to enable a Deep Scan. This is a very time-intensive scan, and should only be done if your first scan doesn't recover the files you need.
 Click the Start button to begin the scan. The scan will begin, and a progress bar will display how far along it is. The time of the scan will depend on how large the SD card is.
 When the scan is complete, you will be shown a list of all the recovered files. Click the Switch to advanced mode button. This will enable the drop-down filter, which will help you narrow the list down a little.


Original file names are almost always deleted during a recovery, so you will need to manually rename recovered files.
 Check the box next to each file you want to recover. Use the preview to determine which files are the ones you want to keep. Once you've checked all the files you want to save, click the Recover button. You will be asked where you want to save the files, and they will then be copied to that location.

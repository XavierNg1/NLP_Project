 To create a 3D video, you need two different videos layered on top of each other. One video is tinted red and the other video is tinted cyan. You’re looking for video editing software that can duplicate and tint videos.These are popular softwares:


Final Cut Pro
Adobe’s Premiere
Cyberlink
Corel
Magix;
, Upload the video you are attempting to three -dimensionalize. All softwares have their own protocols for importing video. This is typically found under file/import off of the menu bar.
 Not every software will allow you to duplicate footage. Make sure you are using a software that can handle two videos on top of each other. Manage your layers and be sure you can go back and forth between videos easily., Select one of your layers and adjust the color so that the color is red. Then select the other layer and color it cyan. When doing this you won’t instantly see the 3D effect., Opacity is also referred to as transparency. You’ll need to adjust the top layer of the video’s opacity. This will create a blend of the colors. Set the top layer to 50%., Now you will need to adjust the position of the top video layer. This will create the classic 3D image that you see without wearing 3D glasses.


You can use your 3D glasses to help guide the positioning.
The top layer does not need to be too heavily adjusted, but far enough so that there is a dizzying effect.
Once the position is correctly aligned, you’ll be able tell using your glasses.

 Cheese fries are a classic variation of the usual French fries. You can pour homemade or store-bought cheese sauce over a plate of fries, or melt shredded cheese over the fries under the broiler.You can add whatever cheese you like to your fries, but cheddar, monterey jack, pepper jack, mozzarella, and gruyere all melt well.
Give your cheese fries a kick by adding chopped jalapenos to the sauce or to the shredded cheese before melting it.
Chopped crispy bacon and green onions make ideal garnishes for a plate of cheese fries.
 Instead of dipping your fries in a sauce, try pouring brown gravy over them. The dish is common in diners, and is especially popular in Canada.You can serve the gravy on the side if you prefer to dip your fries.
In Canada, French fries smothered in brown gravy is called poutine. However, cheese curds are traditionally added to the dish as well.
 If you want your French fries to a meal in themselves, top them with your favorite meat. Chili fries are a popular dish at fast food restaurants and diners, but you may want to try topping your fries with pulled pork, short ribs, shredded barbecued chicken, pastrami, or your favorite meat.To make meat-topped fries even tastier, melt some shredded cheese over the meat and fries before eating them.

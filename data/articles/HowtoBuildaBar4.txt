 You will need to determine the measurements of the bar-top for yourself, as it will depend heavily upon your needs and preferences. Form the base from three pieces of plywood, the front piece wedge between the side pieces. The overhang should be at least 6”. Dimensions of roughly 12” x 50” for the front piece and 12” x 33 ½” for the side pieces is recommended.
 Use 1 ¼” screws to attach the bar-top base to the walls, being careful to center your screws in the top edge of the wall.
 You will then need to cut to size a bar-top from whatever material you wish to use. The measurements will depend on the dimensions of your bar-top base. For the bar-top, the front piece will need to be longer than the side pieces, fitting in the opposite way to how the base was constructed (this will give it strength). The bar-top will also need to be narrower in order to fit the bar-top molding. Check the depth between the two slots on your molding to determine how much narrower the bar-top will need to be. Measure and cut the material accordingly and then place it using 1 ¼” nails. Try to place the nails in such a way that they will be covered by the lip of the molding (if it is wide enough to allow that).
 Once that is done, measure your molding to fit and then miter the three pieces together at 45° (leaving it flat at the back ends so that it sits flush with the edge of the end cap). Nail it into place with 1 ¼” nails from the underside of the plywood base. You’re done!

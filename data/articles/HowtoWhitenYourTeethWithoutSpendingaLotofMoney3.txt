 Changing your eating and drinking habits can help maintain white teeth. Some foods are more likely to stain teeth and some can help maintain whiteness.


Most types of berries, like blueberries, blackberries, and cherries, can stain teeth with streaks of blue, purple, or red. Strawberries, however, are acidic enough that they can actually whiten by breaking down bacteria causing stains and can also be used with baking soda to brighten your teeth.Be careful when drinking wine and coffee. Both tend to stain teeth. If you really want a cup of coffee with breakfast or wine with dinner, sip water while drinking. Slosh the water around in your mouth to remove any excess coffee or wine to prevent staining. Adding milk or cream to coffee can also reduce staining.Seeds, nuts, and other harder grains that require chewing can help whiten teeth. This helps rub off plaque, which contributes to tooth decay and staining., Perhaps the best way to keep teeth white is simply through proper care. Brush, floss, and use mouth wash on a regular basis.


Most people brush their teeth in the morning and before bed. Sticking to a routine like this can help you maintain regular care, but you should also brush your teeth after eating anything high in sugar. The acids from sugary snacks require prompt removal.Replace your toothbrush every 3 to 4 months and make sure to floss daily. You should also use some kind of mouthwash, such as chlorhexidine mouthwash, to combat bad breath and add extra protection to your teeth., Regular dental checkups are important for a variety of reasons. In order to keep your teeth white and healthy, make sure to see a dentist at least once a year.

 Labels on tags, for example, can be easily cut from clothing. This will make it easier for potential thieves to remove the labels that indicate the clothing is yours. A label on the fabric of the clothing, however, will be difficult to remove without doing damage.


Consider labeling the inside collar or bottom hem of shirts. For pants, you might label the inner waistband or bottom cuff.
When labeling with a writing utensil, like a permanent marker, test a less visible portion of the fabric first. This way you can check that the ink doesn't bleed through the fabric.;
, Labeling visible areas of your children's clothing could put them at risk to child predators. Children often regard adults who know their name as safe. Hide labels on the underside of fabric to prevent this.


When your children are under constant supervision, like when playing a sport or on a field trip, obvious labels are OK.
In some cases, like when on school trips, obvious labels can help supervising adults keep tabs on your kids.
As a general rule of thumb, if your child will at any point be unsupervised, even if it's only when walking home, all clothing labels should be hidden from view., Over time, even labels that were once safe can become less so. Peeling edges, loose threads, or weakened adhesive can cause your label to be pulled off your children's items. In these cases, your label can become a choking hazard.


You may want to create a safety schedule on your calendar or with your cell phone to help you remember to check the safety condition of labels.
A label that is properly attached to an item should hold up for some time. A once-a-month safety check should be sufficient.
You may want to check the label condition of heavily used or frequently washed items more frequently. The labels on these will be more likely to degrade quickly.

Decimation describes the wiping out of humans. In ancient Rome, “decimate” literally meant "kill one of every ten soldiers."

Ex. “The 2010 tsunami in Japan decimated cities and towns along the coast.”


Using creative license, you would also be correct in saying something like:

“The flu decimated Larry's sixth grade class.” (Everyone will understand that more/less than ten percent were affected and nobody actually died.)


Remember that "decimate" is similar to "decimal," which refers to counting by tens.



Devastate means "lay waste to."

Ex. “Natural disasters can devastate a region’s buildings, forests, and landscapes.”


Devastate also means “overwhelm with negative emotions.”

Ex. “A nasty breakup can devastate an individual.”

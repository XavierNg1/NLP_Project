 Acquaintances and coworkers generally aren't good audiences. Your loved ones are usually happy to hear about what's going on with you, as long as every conversation doesn't get sucked into the realm of your issues. Remember, they also have their own lives and struggles.


Constant complaining about your problems can cause you to come off as immature and whiny.;
, Venting can help you feel better, but going on constant rants hinders your ability to move forwards.
 Moaning about your relationship may make you feel better, but it only is useful in small doses. Focus on turning your talk into something more productive: explain the problem as calmly as you can, and ask your loved one how to respond to the situation well. Listen closely to their response.


"Jake and I are having some issues with our schedules. Is now a good time to talk about it? I could really use some advice."
"I feel really frustrated and confused. How do you think I should handle this?"

, If you notice that you've been going on for a while, without letting your conversation partner get in many words, stop. Take a deep breath and give the other person a chance to speak. They may welcome a shift in conversation, or they may ask you to keep going (in which case you're in the clear).


"I'm sorry, I'm going on and on about my relationship problems, aren't I?"
"I realize I've been doing most of the talking since we met up. What's going on with you?"

, Listening is an incredibly important life skill, and listening to your loved ones can improve your relationship. Pay close attention to them and focus on what they have to say.

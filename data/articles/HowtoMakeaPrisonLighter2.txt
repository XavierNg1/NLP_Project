 You're going to want to cut it into a thin line that's just a bit smaller than your pinky finger, and fold it (length-wise). Next cut the edge that has been made when you folded the strip to make it thinner than the strip itself, in order for both the negative and positive side connect and heat up.
 Take one side of the tin foil strip and put it on the plus side of the battery.
 Again there may be a delay it can take 1 second to a 3 minute for the tin foil to catch fire.

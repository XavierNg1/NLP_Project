 Do not honk your horn and expect the train to stop; a train will not be able to come to a complete stop immediately. Even if it is slowing down, it will still plow through you before it can come to a stop. Do not attempt to play chicken with a moving train. It's not backing down; you must. Get out of the car, and tell any passengers do to the same.;
, Do not risk your life to gather objects from the back seat (unless they are infant passengers). You may be too late. You may want to take a cell phone if it is in easy reach.
 As in, as soon as possible.
 Do not attempt to run away from the train; when the train collides with your car, the wreckage may fly through the air and hit you. Run in the opposite direction of the train. It may be best to take cover, if there is any, to avoid flying debris from the car being smashed by the train.

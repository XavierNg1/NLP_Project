Cross the ends of the strips and pull one end through the loop that forms. If you want the color from a particular end of the strip, tie the knot at the other end. Don't twist the paper, just loop it.
Gently tighten the knot, then gently pull the knot without creasing or squeezing the strip of paper.
When all the edges are in contact, press it down and crease. You should have a pentagon with a long end and a short end sticking out.
 If there's a little more than a pentagon width, you can tear it off or fold it under and tuck it in.
 The result should be a fatter pentagon. Fold so that the color you want faces out, if the two sides of the strip are different.
 If there is a little too much, fold it over or tear it off before tucking it in.

Make a whole bunch of these and display them in a jar or clear glass.
Display them mixed with confetti or tinsel as part of the party decorations on a table.
Work a needle and thread or string through opposite corners to string them together as a garland or necklace. You could combine them with paper beads or other elements on the same string.

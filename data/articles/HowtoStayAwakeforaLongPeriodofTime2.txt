 Warm or hot environments can make us feel tired, sluggish, and sleepy. In contrast, cold environments can make us feel more alert. Indeed, BUD/S candidates say that when you’re freezing cold, it’s almost impossible to fall asleep. They are subjected to up to 15 minutes immersed in water that is barely above 60 degrees Fahrenheit.Go outside and jump in the snow.
Drink a glass or two of ice water.
Sit in an ice bath.
Adjust the air conditioning to make the room cold.
Take a cold shower.
Perform the above techniques with caution. Too much time spent in the cold can cause your body temperature to drop too low, resulting in hypothermia. Hypothermia is a potentially deadly condition.
 You’re less likely to fall asleep when you're uncomfortable, according to one military member who successfully completed Hell Week.This may involve getting “wet and sandy” like the BUD/S candidates do or standing up instead of sitting or lying down.
 Crank up the volume on your stereo. Loud noises will make it difficult to relax and fall asleep. For added benefit, get up and dance to the loud music.


Listen to rock, death metal, or upbeat pop. Avoid slow, boring music.
 Go outside or move to a different room in your house if you feel yourself getting tired. Often, new surroundings can provide novel things to focus your attention on. This can help you feel less tired.


If you are inside, go outside and vice versa.
Move to a different room. Avoid rooms with beds, comfortable couches, and comfortable chairs.

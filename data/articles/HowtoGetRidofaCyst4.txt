 A pilonidal cyst is a cyst that occurs around the buttocks or lower back. The cyst may be tender, warm to the touch, and may produce pus or other drainage. In order to stop the cyst from growing, keep the area surrounding it clean and dry. Pilonidal cysts are often caused by ingrown hairs, which are hairs trapped beneath the surface of the skin. Remove any hair follicles near the cyst to prevent them from becoming ingrown., As pilonidal cysts can lead to potentially serious infections, you should always have them examined by a medical professional. Make an appointment with your general practitioner when you notice the development of a pilonidal cyst.


Usually, a doctor will give you a brief physical examination and look at the cyst. The doctor will also ask about any drainage you've noticed, whether the cyst is painful, and how long you think it's been there.The doctor will also ask whether you have other symptoms. If the cyst has caused a rash or fever, the doctor might recommend removal. If the cyst is not causing problems no treatment is needed., The least invasive measure to remove a pilonidal cyst is having it lanced and drained. The doctor will cut a small hole in the cyst and drain any excess fluid. The cyst will then be packed with gauze. You may be prescribed antibiotics to prevent infection., Cysts sometimes recur after draining. Your doctor might recommend surgical removal. Surgery is usually brief, but recovery time can be lengthy and you may have an open wound that needs cleaning.

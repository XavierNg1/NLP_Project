 Many plants do well when you start them from seeds. Check your local garden center for seed packets and look at the label to see how long they take to grow, when is the best time to plant them, and how much water they need.


Growing from seed can take anywhere from one to four months depending on what you are growing, so it is important to plan ahead.
Growing from seeds is the cheapest option, as a pack of seeds costs only a few dollars or cents. Full grown plants purchased from a gardening store can cost anywhere from $1-$50 each.
Keep in mind that when you plant from a seed, you can start the seed in a container and keep it indoors or put it right into the ground. However, planting a seed in a container and starting it indoors may result in a healthier plant than starting outdoors in the ground., The benefit of transplanting a mature plant into your soil or container is that it is already partially grown and will bear fruit sooner. The plant will also be more likely to survive and thrive. Transplanting mature plants takes only a few minutes of work once the rest of your garden has been prepped.

Check your local garden store for mature plants and make sure to check the tags on the plants to determine if they will work for the type of garden you are planning.
 If you choose to grow flowers, you also have the option of planting bulbs. Bulbs are easy to plant, and they come back every year. However, bulbs only bloom for a few weeks at a time.


Check your local garden store for bulbs that you can plant in your garden and enjoy year after year.

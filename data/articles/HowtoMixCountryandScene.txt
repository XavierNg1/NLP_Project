, Separate all the clothes you can't wear, the clothes you don't want but can wear, and the clothes you can wear. Give away or recycle clothing you can't wear and box up and store the clothes you don't want but still can wear, just in case you change your mind. If you really don't want those old clothes than give them away or recycle them too.
 Try a style such as parting your hair in a horizontal line and put low pigtails on the lower half and making the top half in a bob-like style. An example of this type style is when Wenwen Han first appeared in the movie Karate Kid.

 Based on what you’ve read, write notes for yourself using your questions, the answers to them, and other pertinent content that struck your interest. Use the format of note-taking that suits you best (e.g. lists in point form.) Be sure that your notes are legible and coherent enough to refer to easily later on.If you understand things better in list form, for instance, make a list of the most notable battles during WWI when writing your history notes.
 While you write your notes, record the page numbers of the source material that you are referencing. Having this information will allow you to go back to the source easily when you review your notes. If any pertinent maps, charts, pictures, or other visual aids relate to part of your notes, write down the page numbers for those as well., In addition to taking written notes, summarizing the content you’ve read (either out loud or in your head) is an excellent way to process and retain the information. Organize your thoughts as if you were giving a lecture or oral presentation about the subject, and make the “lesson” as comprehensive as possible.By formulating the material that you’ve studied in the style of a presentation, you make the content more engaging and understandable for yourself as well as your imaginary audience.

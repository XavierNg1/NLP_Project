 Repetitive motion injuries (RMIs) occur because of overuse. Muscles and connective tissues don’t have enough time to repair themselves, which leads to strain and eventual injury. So avoid RMIs by allowing yourself ample recovery time.
 Even in the context of manual labor, it is important to stretch a variety of muscle groups to prevent injury. Pay special attention to the muscles that you habitually work., Work equipment that is too large, too small, or non-functional can force your body into unnatural and dangerous stress positions. Make sure that you use proper tools and safety equipment.If you have a job where you have to bend down a great deal, or a job that requires picking up heavy loads, consider a back support/lifting belt. They generally range from $25 – $100 new, and you can find them online, or at any sporting goods or orthopedic store.
 Akin to taking breaks, varying routines is an excellent way to prevent RMIs. Varying routines is difficult to do at work, but try.It’s usually cheaper to move workers around to different tasks than it is to pay for worker’s compensation.


Try to limit twisting motions, repeated wrist motions, long periods where heavy vibrating machinery is hand-held, repetitive motions with the back, and long periods of standing with little to no opportunity to sit, lean, or re-position.If you can't get rotated out of a particular assignment, see if you can get production lines to be slowed down, which helps minimize jerking motions.
 Use proper lifting techniques all the time, but particularly when you repeat the same motion numerous times a day.Basic lifting techniques include:


Keeping a straight back
Getting as far underneath a load as is possible
Keeping a wide stance
Lifting with your legs
Don’t twist, jerk, or use partial grips

 Different cancers impact different parts of the body, and different stages of cancer impact how severe things are and what type of treatment is needed. Start learning about your sibling’s specific cancer by talking to your sibling or speaking with their doctor.Some cancers are more treatable than others. Understanding what type of cancer your sibling has and what type of treatment they will go through can help offer peace of mind.
 Once you know what your sibling is dealing with, you can do some research on your own. Go to your local library or look at sources like the Mayo Clinic and medical journals online to find out more about the type of cancer your sibling is dealing with.Take a look at survivors’ stories to see what helped others cope with the type of cancer your sibling is dealing with. Pay attention to how this makes you feel. It should make you feel better and like you are not alone, but if it stresses you out or makes you feel worse, then don’t read them.
Look at trusted medical sources. Many non-medical publications publish opinions and unproven data regarding dealing with cancer. It is always best to look at medical sources such as journals and hospital publications before anything else., Support groups are a great place to learn not only about cancer itself, but about methods to help support and care for your sibling. Consider joining a support group meant for friends and family of cancer patients.Support groups may be offered by the hospital at which a sibling is receiving treatment, or you can look for one put on by a local grief counselor.
There are also specialized support groups for children and teens dealing with a sibling’s cancer treatment. Look at youth counselors in your area to see if they offer childhood grief support groups.

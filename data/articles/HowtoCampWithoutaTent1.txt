 A simple roll-out mat may be enough on a warm night, straight under the stars. A comfortable sleeping mat that self-inflates and a sleeping bag or suitable cover should suffice for a good night's rest when the conditions are right.

 Sand is soft and if you burrow in can help insulate you but don't sleep too close to shore in case you've misjudged the tide.
 There are different kinds of hammocks and swinging bed structures available. In some places, such as the jungle, this is really the safest way to sleep, away from the water, bugs and prowling creatures. You can either carry a commercially made hammock suited for the purpose or learn to rig up a simple one using ropes and a tarpaulin or simple strong sheet.

, This will be used to siphon the catnip into the sack.
, Let it balance unaided.
 Tip this into the paper funnel, so that it lands inside the sack. Continue doing this until the sack has been filled.


Pack firmly but leave room for the feathers.
 They should rest on the bottom of the sack and be held tightly inside by the catnip.
 Pull the corners together in the middle to bring all the sides up and around the contents of the sack. Tie together tightly with a piece of yarn, winding the yarn around the closure several times.


There should be a decent amount of the feathers sticking out of the top. Adjust before tightening the tie to ensure this.
If you wish to dangle the toy, leave plenty of yarn length hanging from it for holding from. Knot every so often, as this helps to stop tangling.
 Stitch around the closure using a blind stitch. Although optional, this is a good way to prevent leakage of the catnip and removal of the feathers.
 The feather and catnip toy sack is now ready for play. The cat can play with the rod toy independently, or you can put the stick part on a chair, table, or through a hole so the feather part dangles down.

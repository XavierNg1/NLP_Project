 You'll need the paid version of Adobe Acrobat for this, but you'll be able to save an entire web site, including every page on the server in its original format with working links.
 Enter in the lowest level address for the site if you want to grab the entire thing. If you just want a single page on the site, enter its direct address.
 You can choose to "Get only X level(s)", or you can "Get entire site".


Level 1 is only the page that opens when the address is visited. Level 2 includes every page that is linked on the starting page. Level 3 includes all of the pages that are linked in the Level 2 pages. This can lead to a massive file depending on the website.
 When you start dealing with multiple levels, there's good chance that links will lead off the website. You can prevent Acrobat from grabbing these pages by selecting "Stay on same path", which will only grab pages from the same domain, or "Stay on same server", which will will only grab pages from that web server.
 This allows you to adjust headers and footers, as well as bookmarks for navigation.
 Depending on how many levels you are capturing, and how large the site is, this could take anywhere from a few minutes to a very long time.

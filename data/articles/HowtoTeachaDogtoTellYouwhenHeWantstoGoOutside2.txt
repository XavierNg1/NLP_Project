 If you want to teach your dog to bring you his leash when he wants to go out, you'll need to start keeping it somewhere where he can easily reach it.A location next to the door is ideal. Try putting it in a basket for easy access.
 To get started with this training, pick up the leash and give it to your dog before you let him outside, waiting a few seconds while he holds it. Then reward him with a treat and let him out. Repeat this until your dog seems eager to hold the leash for you.If your dog drops the leash, put it back in his mouth and repeat until he holds it for a few seconds.
 Once your dog has become accustomed to holding the leash in his mouth while you are both next to the door, it's time to move on to the next level of training. After you give him the leash to hold, start slowly walking away. Stand a few feet away from him and encourage him to come to you with the leash, rewarding him with a treat when he does. Repeat this until your dog seems comfortable with the routine.When your dog gets used to this, he may start following you with the leash without you having to call him to you.
 As training progresses, you should be able to walk further and further away from your dog until eventually he will bring you his leash all on his own, without any help from you.This method may not be effective for dogs who do not enjoy playing fetch.
Be sure to respond to him when he brings you his leash by taking him outside right away. Continue using treats to reinforce the behavior for a while.

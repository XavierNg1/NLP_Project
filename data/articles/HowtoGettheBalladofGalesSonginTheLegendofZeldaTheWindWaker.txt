 Cyclos is oneÂ of the two wind gods, and in order to learn "Ballad of Gales" you need to find him (since he'll be the one to teach it to you.) He'll be inside of a large tornado, so that's what you'll be looking for. Sail around until you see it, and keep in mind it will always be in one of the following three locations.


Mother and Child Isles (This is location B-2 on the World Map)
Northern Triangle Island (This is location D-3 on the World Map)
Shark Island (This is location C-6 on the World Map);
, At the base of the tornado, you should see a whirlpool. Sail closer to it, and then allow your boat to get sucked in.
 You should have obtained the Hero's Bow by this point in the game (it was the treasure back in Tower of the Gods). Equip is as soon as you have entered the whirlpool so that you can begin shooting at Cyclos.
 You'll need to hit him three times in order for him to teach you "Ballad of Gales" and it won't be easy. Due to the poor visibility offered once you're inside the whirlpool, aiming is almost impossible, but here are a few things to keep in mind.


Aim high. Even when you can't see Cyclos, your best bet is going to be to aim toward the top of tornado. If you see Cyclos, aim for him, but if you can't see him it's best just to aim high since that's where he'll be.
Shoot quickly. Firing arrows rapidly without aiming is one of the most common ways that people hit Cyclos. Aim if you can, but don't waste too much time aiming for something you can't see. Remember, the more arrows you shoot the more chances you have of hitting him.
 When you have successfully hit him three times, he will descend from the tornado on a cloud and teach the "Ballad of Gales" to you. You will then be able to use it to warp to various points on the map as you so choose.

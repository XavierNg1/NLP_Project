 Every card trick practitioner out there knows how to wow an audience by “magically” revealing a top card that had seemingly been shuffled into the middle of the deck. This trick is a good introduction to the combination of quick hands, skilled fingers, timely audience distraction, and showmanship that card tricks require. Start by practicing the following two skills:









Take two cards from the top deck while keeping them together (so it looks like only one card was drawn).
Slip a card directly below the top card in the deck while the deck is behind your back for only a moment.;
, Tell everyone to look at it. Show it to everyone. Put it under the top card, while the deck is behind your back for a magic moment, where no one can see.









If some protest your having the card behind your back, say it is part of the "suspense", and "it's a magic moment".
 Show only the bottom card to the audience, as if that pair is one card.
 After they confirm "Yes!", put the tricky pair back on top of the deck.
 Remember, the picked card is now moved to the top, unknown to the audience. The audience will think that this was their card.
 You could make a fancy gesture with your hands to really play into the dramatic aspect of the trick.
 It will be the chosen card. This trick usually requires only a little bit of practice, but is puzzling to the audience nonetheless.

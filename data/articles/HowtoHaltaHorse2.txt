 When handling a horse from the ground, you should have a lead rope, or long rope with a metal clasp on one end. This clips onto the horse's halter.
 This is the proper command to halt a horse when you are not mounted.


If your horse doesn't listen when you ask it to stop, make a fist with the hand that's holding the lead rope and gently push into the horse's chest slowly until it stops. Do not hit your horse, just apply the pressure with your hand and arm and it should stop. Be sure never to step in front of your horse as they may step on you.
Make sure your horse respects you and has good ground manners. If you have a horse that likes to pull and refuses to halt try using a chain around the halter. Ask an instructor or trusted horse person if a chain is the right choice for you and your horse.

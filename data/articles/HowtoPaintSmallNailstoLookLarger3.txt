 These make your nails appear to be taller, and you can just use a thin section of tape. Paint over it, and then peel the tape off once the polish dries.
 You can do these with a nail art pen, or a super thin nail polish brush. These designs will make it appear like your nail is big, and the decals are spread out.
 This will draw attention away from your tips, and make your nails seem much larger. You don't even have to grow your nails out.

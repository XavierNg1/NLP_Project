 Your choices include:



Water Culture. This is a low cost, easy-to-build option. It results in your plants being suspended in water by a StyroFoam platform. The water will be filled with a nutrient solution. You can grow 5-6 plants per 5 gallon (18.9Â L) water culture system.

Multi Flow. This is a medium cost, fairly difficult-to-build option. It relies on gravity to flood plant trays with water and nutrient. You can use a timer and float switch to control water levels. You can grow many plants at a time with this system.

Ebb and Flow. This is a low-cost, moderately easy-to-build system. Your plant tray is put on top of a reservoir and connected to the reservoir with tubing. A water pump pumps water and nutrients to the plants. Excess liquid is returned to the reservoir for later use. You can grow a fair amount of plants with this system.
 They are listed in the "Things You'll Need" section.

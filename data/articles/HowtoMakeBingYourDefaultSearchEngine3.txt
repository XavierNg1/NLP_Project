 Look for Mozilla Firefox on your computer and open it. The web browser will load.
 There’s a search bar or box on the header toolbar. This can appear right beside the address bar or on top of it, depending on where you’ve put it. The logo of the default search engine is displayed on the left side of this search bar. Click on it.


The drop-down list contains some options for search engines, such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing.
 Select and click “Bing” from the drop-down list. Its logo will appear on the search box. Bing is now your default search engine in Firefox.

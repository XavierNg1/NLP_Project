, Each strip needs to be at least 10cm/4 inches in length and 2.5cm/1 inch in width. For the best design, use a different fabric for each strip but coordinated. For example, keep flowers with flowers, stripes with stripes, etc.
 Gather it by sewing through the middle several times and knotting off tightly. Repeat for each of the other strips. They will look like little bows.
 To do this, align the middle pieces in a clock formation, fanning around. Then sew all of the center pieces together.


Use a strong needle that is suited for upholstery fabrics and a thimble or thumb protector to give you the necessary oomph to push the needle through.
Sew slowly, as this can be hard going.
For certainty of hold, do at least six stitches, up to ten at most.
 This not only covers up the stitching but serves as the center of the floral brooch. Choose a pretty button!

, Sew the pink/brooch back in place. Check that it is firmly attached.


You could also glue it in place. If so, follow the package instructions.
 The fabric flower brooch is now ready for wearing. Why not make a few more for friends and family?

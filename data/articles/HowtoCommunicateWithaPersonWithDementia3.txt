 Look for a support group for caregivers of those with Alzheimer’s and/or dementia. You can contact your local senior services agency for suggestions, or try searching for one through the Alzheimer’s Association: http://www.alz.org/apps/we_can_help/support_groups.asp

These groups can give you suggestions for ways to communicate with your loved one, as well as offer you comfort and reassurance. They are a great way to avoid feeling isolated, as many caregivers frequently do.
 If you are your loved one’s primary caregiver, you will need a break now and then. Taking care of a person with dementia can be exhausting and all-encompassing, and you need to take care of yourself in order to effectively care for your loved one.Here are some options:

In-home care. You can have someone stay with your loved one at home while you get out of the house for a while.
Senior day center. You can drop your loved one off (or, in some cases, have them picked up) for a few hours of activities and socializing.
Residential facility. This can be an option if you need to have your loved one taken care of overnight, or for a few days if you need to go out of town.
 Other family members involved in your loved one’s care can be an invaluable support. You can talk to them about the highs and lows of day-to-day care, suggest caregiving strategies, and blow off some steam., The doctor, social worker, or nursing home staff may have suggestions in effective communication methods. Opening the lines of communication with others involved can only help improve the care they receive, because you will be a helpful source of information for these professionals as well!

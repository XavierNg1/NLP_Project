 Keep in mind the time in Singapore when making a call. The time zone followed in Singapore is UTC/GMT +8, or 8 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. This means that it is 16 hours ahead of Pacific Standard Time (PST) so if you were calling at noon from California, it would be 4am in Singapore. You can download an app or check online clocks for the current time in Singapore.;
, If you are calling a mobile phone you will need to know the mobile code. Also, calling a home phone will require knowing their schedule to ensure that they are home. A landline may be best to ensure that your conversation isnâ€™t dropped or filled with static.
 Every provider offers different rates for calling long distance. Inquire about special plans and deals if you will be calling Singapore frequently. If you are not with a service provider you may inquire about rates for pay-as-you-go phones.


For example ask your service provider how much you will be charged per minute for calling Singapore from your location. You may also ask if there are any calling packages offered for Asia or Singapore specifically if you plan on calling several times a month.

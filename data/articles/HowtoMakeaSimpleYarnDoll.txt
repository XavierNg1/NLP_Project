 You will be needing these materials:


Yarn (the best color is brown)
Scissors;
, The size of your doll will depend on how long your strips of yarn would be.
 To help you know where's the middle fold it in half and make sure you won't get messed up.
 Tie it super tight so that it's secured. Snip of the excess.
 If you don't understand this step, below where you tied the middle of the string, maybe about 1 inch (2.5Â cm) below, tie it so that it creates a head shape.
 Get maybe about 14-16 strings for each arm. And the rest of the strings for its body. Braid its arms and leave a little amount of "un-braided" strings for its hands.
, Braid the legs and leave a little amount of "un-braided" strings for its feet. Tie the legs tight and also the arms.
 Enjoy the doll!

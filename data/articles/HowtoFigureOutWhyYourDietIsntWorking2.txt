 If you do not eat enough calories each day, your metabolism can slow down and make it difficult to lose weight. You should eat at least 1200 calories each day. If you are not eating this many calories, you cannot get all the nutrients you need and your metabolism will slow.Track your calories for a few days to see if you are eating enough. If you are not, increase how much you are eating.
 Many people believe that cutting carbs, fat, dairy, grains, or other food groups will help them lose weight. Generally, cutting an entire food group is not sustainable over the long term. Instead of cutting foods, try to eat a balanced diet that includes healthy choices in each food group.For example, add healthy fats through avocado and olive or coconut oil. Get healthy carbs through fruit or quinoa. Eat healthy dairy like low-fat cottage cheese and milk or Greek yogurt.
 Some people think skipping meals is a good way to lose weight. Not only does it lower the amount of calories you consume each day, but it confuses your body. If you skip a meal, your body goes into starvation mode because it thinks food is not a readily available option. Therefore, your body won’t allow you to feel full because it’s afraid it’s going to starve.Skipping meals can lead to overeating later. Instead of skipping meals, eat balanced meals each day.

If you are writing, take note that all nouns in German are capitalized.
 Often in English, asking a question is a polite way of saying, "Hello!" In German, it is no different.

"Wie geht es Ihnen?" -- How are you? (formal)
"Geht es Ihnen gut?" -- Are you well?

"Sehr erfreut." -- Nice to meet you.

To respond: "Gut, danke." -- I'm fine, thank you.
"Es geht mir sehr gut." -- I'm very well.
"Ziemlich gut." -- I'm rather well.



If you are asked a question such as this, it is customary to respond with, "Und Ihnen?" -- And you? (formal)

, In every culture or region, there is a different standard of greeting, be it bowing, hugging, or hand-shaking. Germany is a bit different than the rest of Europe.


People in Germany usually prefer to greet non-family members with handshakes instead of the cheek kissing that is customary in most of Europe; however, cheek kissing is still a common type of greeting in many German-speaking countries.
The rules regarding the number of kisses to give and knowing when and who to kiss change from place to place. When you meet someone for the first time, you can usually just shake hands. Then just watch how other people interact. You'll quickly recognize the pattern.

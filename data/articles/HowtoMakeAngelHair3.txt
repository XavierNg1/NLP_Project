 Wash the mussels thoroughly with cold water. Beard them and scrub off any grit. Discard any mussels with open shells.
 Pour the cream, lemon, chicken stock, and salt and pepper into a deep cast iron skillet or another deep pan. Heat the ingredients over medium heat, bringing them to a light simmer.
 Place the mussels in the skillet, cover, and cook the mussels for about 5 minutes, or until their shells open. Remove the skillet from heat.
 Fill the pot about 3/4 full, and put in a few pinches of salt to add some flavor to the noodles.
 Break them up so all the noodles fit.
 This is the state at which the pasta is fully cooked, but still has a good texture, and hasn't become too mushy. It should take 5 - 10 minutes.
 Place a colander or strainer over the sink. Pour the pasta into the colander or strainer to drain the water. Transfer the pasta to a large bowl.
 Pour the cream and mussels sauce from the skillet into the bowl with the pasta.
 This dish is excellent with extra lemon wedges and Parmesan cheese.

 Slip the shorts over the waistline about two to three inches and pull the drawstring to tighten them. The elastic waist should sit comfortably above the hips, while the hem should sit just above the knee.

If you want to sag, do it carefully. Slip on the shorts up to your pubic line. Make sure the back of the waistband is just below the "fault line," so to speak, but tight to your body, using the drawstring to secure the shorts as you walk. To get them to stay, combine fairly large boxer shorts with a tight drawstring to get them to stay without having to constantly tug at them and pull them up.
 If shorts are the perfect size, you don't really have to mess with the drawstring. They should stay on comfortably without much effort, not too tight and not too loose. Jump around a bit to make sure they're secure when you're trying on a pair at the store. Make sure they don't snag against your knee so you'll be ready to hit the field, regardless of what sport your athletic shorts are for.
 Since you're going to be wearing athletic shorts to sweat in, white varieties are often a bad choice. They'll show the sweat more quickly, sometimes even becoming a bit translucent as you work out. You don't want to end up halfway through a 10 mile (16Â km) jog to find out your hiddens are not so hidden.
 Wearing booty jogging shorts or bike shorts around is not recommended. You wouldn't wear a bathing suit to the ball and you shouldn't wear your exercise gear either. What looks normal at the gym doesn't look normal in public. Regardless of how comfortable and cool they are, and regardless of how sick your jump shot is, save the work out shorts for workouts and opt for more professional wear in public.

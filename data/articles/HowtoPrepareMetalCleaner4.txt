 Most chrome is simply plated with chrome, so you do not want to use harsh cleaners that could ruin the finish. Be very careful to clean with a soft cloth or small toothbrush because it will scratch easily. Dry the chrome with a cloth immediately to avoid watermarks. Clean chrome often to avoid tarnish.


If some tarnish remains, clean it with a soft rag and vinegar. For rust, use a crumpled up piece of aluminum foil dipped in vinegar and lightly scrub. Rinse the vinegar and dry the chrome with a cloth.

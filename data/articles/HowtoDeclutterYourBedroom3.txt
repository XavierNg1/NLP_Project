 A common way for clutter to start building up is after a load of laundry. Instead of shoving your cleaned laundry into your room, put it away immediately. When you fold your clothes fresh out of the wash, you decrease the chance of wrinkles. Fold, sort, and put away your clean clothes right after the wash.


Avoid letting piles of clothing build up on the floor of your room.
If you don't have enough room for your clothes, get rid of more clothes.
If you need extra storage for your clothes, organize your clothes based off the season. Once it’s summer, store away all your coats and sweaters in a storage bin and place in a community closet, garage, or an attic.
 Instead of waiting a couple of months to a year, do small bits of organizing and cleaning everyday or week. If you have a small amount of clutter on your desk or in the corner of your room, go take care of it. Don’t let the mess build up. You can save yourself a hassle in the future by tackling bits of clutter as they form.


You should plan to sweep/vacuum your room at least once a week. If you have a cat or dog, consider doing it more often., Many people have problems with hoarding materials or purchasing impulse buys. If you are one of these people, attempt to limit the amount of belongings you purchase. One way to implement this is to consider where the belonging would fit into your room. Ask yourself: “Could this fit in my room practically?” and “Am I buying this for the right reasons?”If you are considering upgrading a belonging, decide if you’re willing to purge the original?
It is okay to have decorations around your room, but too many can over clutter your walls and floor space.

 Always keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction, treat the firearm as if it were loaded, and keep your finger off the trigger.;
,,

Pull the bolt back and visually and physically (stick your finger in there) check there aren't any cartridges in the magazine well or in the chamber.






Be double-sure your firearm is unloaded. You do not want an unexpected boom while stripping your firearm.

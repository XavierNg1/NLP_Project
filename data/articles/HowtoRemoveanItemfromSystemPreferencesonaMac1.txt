 To do this, click on the "System Preferences" icon in the dock. If you have removed this icon from the dock, you can also access the menu by clicking on the "Apple" icon in the task bar, and selecting "System Preferences" from the drop-down menu.;
, Hold your mouse over the item you want to remove, and either right-click or control-click on it.

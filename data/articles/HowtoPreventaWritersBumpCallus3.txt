 If you’re able to, substitute a laptop for a pen and paper. Typing can be much faster and easier than writing, and you’ll be able to give your callus a break. If you’re in school and laptops aren’t allowed, try only to write in class when you really need you, then type all of your homework., Writing on a hard surface can make your marks darker with less effort. In turn, that means you can loosen your grip. You can also use a clipboard or other hard, flat surface to go under pages in a notebook., If endless note-taking is causing your writer’s callus, take less notes. Use a laptop, smart-phone or digital recorder to capture the audio from a lecture, then replay it later instead of having to reread notes. Calluses go away on their own after a few weeks of rest, so you should see a huge change after a semester of recording lectures.
 Just like typing and recording, developing your mental recall will prevent you from having to write as much. Improve your memory by playing brain-exercise games, creating mnemonic devices (where words stand for the first letters of information you want to remember), getting more sleep, or just practice paying more attention. With a little practice and effort, you’ll be able to save your fingers some stress.

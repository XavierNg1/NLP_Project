 How much sugar you add will depend on how sweet you want your drink to be. The more sugar you add, the sweeter it will be.
 There should be no lumps or chunks. Don't worry if you see any seeds, however; you can strain them out.
 Press the back of a spoon against the mess to ensure that you get all the pulp out. When you are done, discard the seeds and return the mixture into the blender. If you don't mind the seeds, then you can skip this step., If you have not already, return the raspberry puree to the blender, and add the ice. Pulse until everything is smooth and evenly combined.
 If you'd like, you can garnish them with mint leaves, lemon slices, or raspberries.

 The organ is a difficult instrument. As such, you will benefit greatly from professional instruction. Once you have located a teacher in your area, create a regular schedule of lessons (such as, twice a week). Find out if there is anything you must bring with you to each lesson. Organize your other life obligations so that they do not conflict with your lesson times., The primary difference between piano and organ is the introduction of a third voice, by way of the foot pedals. To play organ, you must practice proper pedal form and technique. Work to keep your heels together at all times. Additionally, your knees should also be touching. Finally, play on the inside of your foot, which means turning your ankle in., With the organ, you do not want there to be any space between notes. You likewise do not want to the notes to overlap. This is known as “legato playing.” Legato playing also involves a technique called “trapping the note.” This means holding a key down with one finger so that you can advance to another key (note) with a different finger. For example, if you initially press a key down with your first finger, you may need to use your thumb to keep that key down, so that your first finger can advance to another key. Work your way across the keyboard and back to master this technique and achieve a legato effect.Begin practicing legato playing using only the white keys. Once you feel comfortable with this, work to incorporate the black keys.
When you feel comfortable playing legato with your hands, advance to practicing your legato playing with both hands and feet.
 There is only one way to master any instrument: practice, practice, practice. Create a daily practice schedule for yourself and stick with it. The more practice you can put in, the more you will get out of it.

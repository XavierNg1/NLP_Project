 Use another phone to dial your phone number. Surprisingly, if your phone is on, you may find that it isn't very far from you. Have a friend help you by going into various rooms to listen for the phone's ring or vibration.
 Try to remember where you last had the phone, and go back to the places you have recently been. If you had been at a bar the previous night, call the bar and ask about any recovered devices., Somebody you know could have recognized the phone as yours and picked it up, or could have seen where you had been last using it. Sometimes, people even turn a lost phone over to police or security, so contact them to learn if they have received any phones. Check your nearest lost-and-found and ask the customer service employees at stores you may have recently visited.

 After opening your image in GIMP, click on the layer that needs adjustment in the Layers dock. If you are adjusting the brightness of an image that hasn't been split into layers, the single layer "Background" will be selected by default.;
, There are 2 ways to open this menu. The first is to click on "Tools" in the main tool bar, and then select "Color Tools" and "Brightness-Contrast." The second way is to click on "Colors" in the tool bar and then select "Brightness-Contrast."

, Use the slider labeled "Brightness" to adjust the layer's brightness. Moving the slider to the left makes the layer darker, while moving it to the right makes the layer lighter. Note that this transformation will occur uniformly, which means that it will increase or decrease the brightness of each pixel by the same magnitude.


For example, if you increase the brightness of a layer that is too dark overall, the finished image will likely have a washed-out appearance. This is because the brightness slider turns the layer's darkest tones (like black) into medium tones, and so the overall contrast has been reduced.
To adjust brightness in a non-uniform manner, you should use the "Curves" menu instead. This will allow you to adjust brightness while preserving the layer's tonal variety.
 Click "OK" to apply the changes you've made. Remember to save the image before closing GIMP.

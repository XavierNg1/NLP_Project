 Prepare a variety of snacks and desserts for your menu. You could simply have cake and punch or you can prepare a more elaborate spread. If your shower falls during lunch or dinner time you may want to provide a more substantial menu than just dessert.









Finger foods are easy to prepare and the choice of finger foods is endless. Pigs-in-a blanket, miniature ham biscuits, mini quiches, assorted finger sandwiches of meat and cheese or chicken/egg salad croissants are always great options.
Prepare either a fruit or fresh vegetable tray and serve with a delicious dip. Strawberries and grapes make good fruit selections because they require no cutting up.
You can round out your shower menu with small snack items such as chips n dip, snack mix, assorted cubed cheeses and crackers, nuts, mints or whatever else you can think of that your guests would like. If you have a specialty dish or dessert, make it for the shower.
 Make your own punch using sherbet and ginger ale, or buy a prepared frozen punch starter from the ice cream section of your grocery store and simply add ginger ale. Float a couple of small rubber duckies in the punch bowl for a truly fun accent! Serve the punch in goblets for a more elegant touch. You will probably want to have some chilled bottled water, coffee or diet drinks available for guests who would prefer.
 Cake is a baby shower staple. Special ordering a cake for a group can be expensive, so baking your own cake or cupcakes from a box mix and canned icing then decorating them with simple colored candy sprinkles or decorative cupcake picks is a less costly option.









Display your decorated cupcakes by placing them on a footed cake plate scattered with candy sprinkles and add a cute figurine or rubber ducky in the center.
A cheesecake sampler is a good alternative to your standard cake, especially for a small number of guests. These are found in most supermarket bakeries.

 Add one tablespoon to trisodium phosphate cleaner to 1 US gal (3.8 L) of warm water. Dip a large sponge into the mixture and scrub the soot off of the walls (or other hard surface). After scrubbing with the cleaning mixture, rinse the hard surface with a clean wet rag.You may need to repeat this process several times.
Work on one section at a time so that you can scrub and clean as you go.
Be sure to use rubber gloves when handling the cleaner because it is quite harsh and can damage your skin.
 Most hard surfaces with soot stains can be cleaned by scrubbing them with a sponge (or towel) and a regular household cleaning detergent, like an all-purpose cleaner. Simply spray some of the cleaner on the sponge and wipe the soot away. You will need to rinse the sponge periodically so you don’t just keep transferring the soot stains as you clean.Start from the bottom and work your way up.
This can be very effective in preventing the soot from transferring onto other surfaces, which could cause the mess to get bigger or even create a permanent stain.

 Whether your following a recipe or simply preparing fruit for a dessert dish, choose the type and amount needed. Most types of dried fruit will reconstitute well.;
, The fruit should not come more than halfway up the bowl, as it is going to double or even treble in size once the moisture is restored.
 Pour enough to cover, and about another inch/2.5 centimeter (1.0Â in) of water over the top.
 The fruit should soak for at least 12 hours, or overnight. Either place a lid, upside down plate or clean tea towel over the top, to prevent insects or anything else from falling in during the soaking process.
 If you're happy it's ready, use as required. If not, leave a bit longer.

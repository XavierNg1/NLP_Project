 If it is just you or your family, the next step is not quite as important. However, if you are taking a scout troop or a group of friends, read the next step carefully.;
, If someone is injured on the trip, the insurance information will make a huge difference in the care they receive. Health information is very important in planning the trip, for example, you cannot pack peanut butter if your friend is allergic to peanuts. If someone who is coming needs routine medication, make sure they have it. If they wear glasses or contacts, make sure they have a case, saline(contacts only)and/or a spare pair of glasses.
 If you are not sure what to put in it, read "Things You'll Need". You should also teach yourself general First Aid.
 If you do not know this, you will go through the trouble of purchasing and packing a tent when you were supposed to sleep in a cabin.
 Try not to pack too many perishable food items, like cheese, chicken, and milk. Basically, try to avoid dairy products and meat, because they can make you sick if you eat them when they go bad. Trail mix is great for snacks, fruit for breakfast, crackers for lunch, and leftovers for dinner. Also, remember to pack lots of water.
 You can put smaller items in a backpack or rolling suitcase and the larger items like your sleeping bag can be carried in a garbage bag. They are great for carrying and can be folded and stubbed into a small space until needed.

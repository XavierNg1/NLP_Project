If using a charcoal grill, once the charcoal is fully lit, scatter them in your grill so that there is a hotter area and a cooler area. Having one uniformly hot area will make it harder to cook the lobster.
 If you've decided you want to cut the lobster in half, get a clean break so that you have two smaller halves of lobster for each tail. Leave the meat in its shell.
 Many people like to add lemon juice as well.
 Start with the meat side down before flipping over to the shell side. You may need to cook the shell side a bit longer than the meat side for perfect doneness.









Make sure that the tails do not burn â€” if there are any flames on the grill, move the lobster away from them.
The tail meat is cooked when it's turned opaque and is no longer translucent.

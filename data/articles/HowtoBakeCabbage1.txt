 Set your oven to 360°F (182°C) so it can heat up while you prepare your ingredients. If your oven runs a little hot, set your oven to 350°F (177°C), and if it runs a little cool, set to 375°F (191°C). Preheating usually takes about 15 minutes., Coat the bottom and sides of your casserole dish or roaster pan with cooking spray. Spread your cabbage evenly in the bottom of your dish. Drizzle olive oil over the cabbage. Lightly toss the cabbage to evenly distribute the oil., Arrange 1 to 2 pats of butter on top of the cabbage. Encourage a better distribution of butter by breaking pats into chunks and spreading these over the cabbage, or by using more pats of butter. Add salt and pepper to taste.


To give your baked cabbage some kick, lightly sprinkle some crushed red pepper flakes over the it. Toss the cabbage to distribute the flakes., This will prevent the cabbage from becoming too dry while it bakes. Do not overfill the pan. The water should be no more than a quarter of the height of your cabbage., Lid your dish and put it in the preheated oven. Allow the cabbage to bake for about 45 minutes., Open your oven and remove the lid with an oven mitt or potholder. Close the oven and continue to bake the cabbage until the water has evaporated.


Stir the cabbage occasionally during this time with a utensil, like a wooden spoon., Baking the cabbage for about an hour and 15 minutes will yield a very tender, slightly browned cabbage. Remove the cabbage sooner for firmer cabbage. Serve your cabbage and enjoy.Use an oven mitt when handling the dish and place potholders beneath it to prevent burns and heat damage.
Seal baked cabbage in an airtight container and save it for up to 5 days in your refrigerator. Frozen, your prepared cabbage can last up to 12 months.

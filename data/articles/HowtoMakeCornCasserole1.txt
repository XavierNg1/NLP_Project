, Liquefy the butter with short, 30 second intervals. The butter does not need to be hot, just completely melted.
 Using a whisk or spatula, blend all of the ingredients together so that they are combined with no chunks of muffin mix or sour cream.


If you want to add spices like garlic powder, black pepper, or hot sauce, add them now.
 Using cooking spray or a small pat of butter, grease an oven-safe dish so that the casserole does not stick when you serve it.


You can use a paper towel to evenly spread a light coating of butter across the dish.
 Once all of the mixture is in the bowl, use a rubber spatula or spoon to evenly distribute it across the pan. The top should be relatively flat.
 When done, the casserole will be a light golden brown on top. If you prefer a heartier, drier casserole than you can leave it in the oven for closer to an hour.
 You can also add the cheese as the casserole finishes cooking -- just apply the cheese to the top of the casserole 5 minutes before you plan on taking it out of the oven.

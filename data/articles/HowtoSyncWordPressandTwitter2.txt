 Next to the “Broadcasting enabled for” heading are checkboxes for what events trigger broadcasts (tweets). Depending on what plugins you have installed, you may see more than Posts and Pages. Select "Posts."


Select “Pull in social comments from Facebook and Twitter.” This is if you’d like to get reactions from your Facebook feed posted on your WordPress site.
Next to the “Post broadcast format” heading is a text box that allows you to create the template for your tweets. There is a list of dynamic tokens you may use, and you can also add your own text.
Next is a “Comment broadcast format,” which allows you to adjust the template for how social media comments post to your site. Like before, you may also select dynamic tokens to place in the template.
 Once you’re happy with how the automated posts will look, you may click "Save Settings" at the bottom of the page, and you have just synced Twitter with your WordPress site.

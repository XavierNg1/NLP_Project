 Make an appointment with your eye doctor to get fitted for the correct contacts. Be sure to mention you have dry eyes. Talk to your optometrist about any concerns you have regarding contact wearing and any symptoms you have for dry eyes or any other contact lens-related problems.During your appointment, discuss your lifestyle briefly so you can choose what kind of contacts make the most sense for you – daily, weekly, monthly, etc.
Your eye specialist will also be able to help you uncover any other possible reasons for your dry eyes.;
, Be sure to get a watery contact lens, which means that the lens has high moisture levels. This will suit your eyes better than regular ones and help prevent the symptoms of dry eyes.The material that the contacts are made of matters greatly in this issue. The thicker the material, the more likely you’ll have problems with dry eyes (especially if you already suffer from dry eye symptoms). So choosing a thinner, more breathable material will help reduce your discomfort from dry eyes significantly.
 Work with your optometrist to ensure that your contacts are fitted properly to the shape of your eye. An ill-fitting contact will move around more than it should, often causing dryness and discomfort.If you think your contacts might not fit properly (they feel like they move around or don’t go in perfectly), consult with your optometrist about changing the prescription size.

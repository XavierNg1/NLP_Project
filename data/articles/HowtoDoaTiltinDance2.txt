 As noted above, you'll want to stretch all of the muscles involved in performing the splits before attempting a tilt - glutes, groin, lower back, hips, etc. Most important of all are the hamstrings. The flexibility of these muscles directly dictates how straightly you'll be able to extend your leg and how far you'll be able to stretch it. Luckily, adding any number of a wide variety of hamstring stretches to your fitness routine can help you improve flexibility in your hamstrings.
 When holding a tilt, you're balanced on one leg with the other in the air and your upper body jutting out to the side. This is not an easy position to hold for any length of time without falling over. Doing so requires great balance, especially in the form of strong core and "stabilizer" muscles. Try adding balance-strengthening exercises to your fitness routine. These exercises help improve both your natural sense of balance and the stabilizing muscles you use for the tiny posture adjustments that keep you upright while performing a tilt.
 Finally, as in many other dance moves, a strong core is essential for performing tilts. Core muscles are vital for balancing and supporting your weight in awkward dance positions like the tilt. More importantly, a strong core can help prevent strain and injury, especially to the back, which can be debilitating for any type of athlete, dancers not excepted. So, be sure to incorporate plenty of core exercises into your fitness routine - crunches, planks, deadlifts, squats, and lunges, for starters.

 Before making an effort to increase your cat’s exercise routine, get approval from your veterinarian. Age related issues like arthritis or vision loss might make play, chasing, or jumping dangerous for your cat. Follow your vet’s recommendations for your senior cat’s ideal activity level.Ask questions like, "I was hoping to increase my cat's activity level by having it chase toys several times a day. Is my cat in good enough physical shape for that kind of activity?"

, Regularly engaging your senior cat in moderate play and exercise is the best way to help it lose weight. Engage your cat by playing on its hunting instincts, dragging and tossing a string, fishing rod toy, or toy mouse for it to follow. You can also use a laser pointer to capture your senior cat’s attention and get it moving.If your cat shows signs of fatigue or shortness of breath, stop the activity immediately and call your vet if the problem persists.
 Purchase puzzle toys, which you can fill with treats and leave for your cat to play with at its leisure, online or at your local pet store. Cats work to slowly extract their reward from the toy, which usually takes several hours and plenty of energy. Cats are not able to overindulge on treats because of how time-consuming it is to get them out of the toy., To encourage your cat to play, buy refillable toys and fill them with dried catnip, available at pet stores. Use approximately 1 tsp.(0.5 oz.) of the harmless herb, which should be enough to elicit a "high" that will stimulate your cat's energy and enthusiasm. You can also make a catnip spray to apply directly to toys, or spray in your cat's play area.

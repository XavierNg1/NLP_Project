 Because you're a teacher, students automatically respect you by default. By learning their names and using them on a regular basis, you are showing your students that you care and that you don’t take their respect for granted. This makes them feel good and respect you even more. If you’re not good with names, or if you have a big group, don’t hesitate to pass out blank name tags to each student at the start of class to help yourself out. This will also help students get to know each other, as well.;
, Once you’ve learned your students’ names, use them on a daily basis. If students feel welcomed into your classroom, they’ll want to stay and learn.
 This can happen before or after class or during class breaks. Socializing with students takes time on your part, but it’s a worthwhile investment. From a student's point of view, socializing makes you seem more approachable, less intimidating, and easy to talk to.
 Students will like you if they feel like you want to know who they are. To jump-start the “get to know your students” process, hand out a student survey at the beginning of the term that asks general interest questions.


For younger students and smaller class sizes, invite each student to prepare a short presentation about themselves that they can share with the entire class.
 Students like to be heard and understood, just like teachers do. If you want your students to be engaged, ask questions, and take risks, they need to know that you listen to them and care about what they have to say.


To encourage dialogue from your students, set designated discussion or debate sessions in your class and encourage everyone to speak their mind.
For younger students or smaller classroom sizes, invite students to pick a topic on something they are interested and make it their task to teach you something new.

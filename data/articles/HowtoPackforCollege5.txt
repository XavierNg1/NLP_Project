 If you're bringing a car, find out where to park and how much it will cost. You may just change your mind, depending on what you find out. If you won't be bringing a car, find out if you need another way to get around campus besides walking. Some campuses are too big to get from class to class without having a car, bike, skateboard, longboard, scooter, etc., although most probably provide some form of shuttle transport which you can avail yourself of.
 The following items depend on your phone plans, but you may want:


A cordless phone
A cell phone
Phone cards
Answering machine

, Have an umbrella and a good raincoat for those days when you need walk in the rain and keep your textbooks dry. If you're in an area with high rainfall, consider waterproof pants as well if you have to walk everywhere. Books can also be kept safe inside a watertight backpack., A lot of great memories will be made at college, and ten years from now you will be glad you brought a camera! If you don't have your own camera, and would rather not fork over the cash for one right now, get a few disposable cameras. They work just as well, although with the cost of getting films processed on top, you're probably likely to find a good digital camera on sale for the same end price.
 If you have a smartphone, iPad, eReader or similar portable electronic device though, simply download maps and carry them around with you at all times.

 The "A" stands should be straight up.
 You should try to push the bottoms of each leg about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) into the ground, keeping the top supporting bar parallel to the ground.
 Tightly tie the stake and the leg together with strong twine.
 These stakes provide your trellis with extra support.
 The nails should be spaced evenly about 6 inches (15 centimeters) apart. Do not hammer the nails flat into the bars.
 Each clothesline should be about 3 feet (1 meter) in length, and one piece of clothesline should connect two screws on opposing netting bars, parallel to the legs of the "A" stand.


Heavy twine or flexible wire may also be used in place of clothesline.

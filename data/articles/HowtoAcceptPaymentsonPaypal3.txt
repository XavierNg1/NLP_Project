 PayPal allows you to receive credit card payments on your Apple or Android device. This is especially convenient for people and small businesses that receive most of their payments on the street such as food trucks, small street vendors, etc.


In the U.S., PayPal takes a 2.7% fee for every mobile card swipe. The rate is slightly higher if you manually input the card number or scan it with your phone's camera (3.5% + $.15 per payment.), The app is available for free in the Apple Store and Google Play Store. Install the app on your device.
 You'll be asked to log in with your PayPal account. The App will confirm your address and phone number. It will then offer to mail you your free Card Reader attachment. Use the confirmation code you were emailed to complete the signup process.
 You can choose to include your location, website, and Facebook. This information will appear on your customers' receipts.
 The simplest option is to input each sale individually, but you may also want to create a list of individually-priced products to choose from. When a customer is ready to pay, plug the PayPal Card Reader into your device's audio jack. You should receive a "Card Reader Connected" notification.
 Select "Card" on the next page. Swipe your customer's card through the card reader. The card should be positioned so that it is upside down with its strip is facing away from you.


When swiping, use one smooth, quick motion, ensuring that the entire magnetic strip passes through the card reader.
If you don't have your Card Reader yet, you can still take credit card payments. You will be prompted to enter the card information manually or scan it using your phone.
 Click "Complete Purchase" to finalize the sale and receive payment. Offer to email the customer the receipt.

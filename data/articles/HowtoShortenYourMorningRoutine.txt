 If you're taking a shower in the morning, try to remind yourself to hurry it up. Maybe a note on the wall saying "keep it quick", or a waterproof clock will help remind you how long you are taking so you get out quicker.;
, It will save you some time.
, Add a little mousse or hairspray if you need to keep it in place, and let it dry naturally. Avoid blow drying, straightening, and curling unless you can get the curls or waves you want with a quick scrunch.
 Try to stay natural, use a concealer for any blemishes, a powder to set, maybe a light eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara and lip gloss. Aim to spend no more than about 8 minutes on makeup. Time yourself on the weekends and try to find ways to make your makeup process as quick as possible.


Take your shower and shave, if you need to.






Braid or set your hair overnight to produce curls or waves for the next morning.






Set out your clothes for the next day.






Set out anything you need to take with you the next day so that you don't forget it, and so that you don't have to go hunting for it. When you get home, set things down where you can find them easily the next morning.

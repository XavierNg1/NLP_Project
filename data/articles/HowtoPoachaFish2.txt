 Olive oil poaching is a technique best used with fish that are sturdy and flavorful, such as salmon, halibut or tuna. Choose either steaks or fillets that are about 3/4 to one inch thick for best results.The taste and texture of the final dish is better with thicker, sturdier fish than it is with very delicate fillets.


Season the fish with salt, pepper and other herbs that complement the meal you're serving.
This method also works well with shrimp, prawns and other shellfish.
 Cooking at a low temperature will preserve the integrity of the fish.
 Set it out on the counter for 10 minutes or so before you cook it. Letting the fish come to room temperature will ensure that it cooks evenly and fully once you place it in the oil bath. Putting it straight into the oil from the refrigerator would cause the temperature of the oil to drop, throwing off the cooking time and affecting the taste and texture of the finished dish., Line a glass baking dish with thin slices of lemon, then arrange the fish fillets on top of the lemon slices. Pour enough olive oil over the fish to cover the fillets.
 Place the baking dish in the oven and poach the fish until the fillets are opaque and flake apart easily when forked. Check the fish after an hour, and return it to the oven for an additional 10 to 15 minutes if the fillets need additional time. Serve warm over a bed of rice or steamed vegetables.

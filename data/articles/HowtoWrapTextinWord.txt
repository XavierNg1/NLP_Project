 A mouse is useful for working with images in Word, because you have more control of the size and shape when you can click and drag the image.;
, Scroll down until you find “Photo.” This will allow you to insert any jpg, pdf or other type of image that you have on your computer or drives into the document.
 Choose “Picture From File” if your image is on your desktop or in another folder., Then, click the “Insert” button at the bottom of the dialog box.
 Keep in mind that Word’s default setting is to put the image “in line.” This means it will treat it as if it is a large letter or a tall line of text.


Image wrapping will allow the text to wrap around the image, go over the image or be beside the image.
 This action will bring up the picture formatting menu in Word. Clicking outside of the image will take the picture formatting menu away and bring you back to the text formatting menu.,, You will get a drop down menu.

Choose “Top and Bottom” if you want the image to stay on its own line, but be between text on the top and bottom.
Choose “Tight” to wrap text around a round or irregularly shaped image.
Choose “Through” to customize the areas that the text will wrap. This is best if you want the text to be incorporated with your image in some way, or not follow the borders of the image file. This is an advanced setting, because you will pull or drag image points in and out of their original borders.
Choose “Behind Text” to use the image as a watermark behind the text.
Choose “In Front of Text” to display the image over the text. You may want to change the color, or it can make the text illegible., The program will allow you to place it where you want it now, with the text flowing around it.
 Each image and project requires different types of text wrapping. Repeat each time you add a new image.

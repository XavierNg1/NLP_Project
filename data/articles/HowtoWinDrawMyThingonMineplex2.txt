 Your turn to draw could be at any point in the game, so be prepared. At the end of each round be ready to draw. It could be you next!

, You have a restricted amount of time so every second counts.
 This could lead to you making mistakes and having to start over. Also, people might not be able to work out what you are drawing if you aren't taking care.
 This can save time as well.
 For example, don't use black to draw milk. It confuses people. If the colour you want isn't available, just draw the outline of the thing in black. (For example if you were drawing a pig, you could just draw the outline of it instead of colouring it in purple)

 If you don't have the app, use your browser to access the YouTube homepage. Be sure you have logged in so that the changes you make are applied to your account. Both the app or browser, so long as you are logged in to your account, will work for making these changes.
 Scroll to the recommended videos for your account in your app or browser. You should find three vertical dots to right of each video. These represent the options available for each recommended video. The topmost option after you tap the three dots should read, "Not Interested." Tapping this should remove the video for your feed.
 You can only flag your unwanted videos one at a time, so you will need to tap the three dots and select "Not Interested" for each video you want removed.
 For as long as your YouTube account has data off which to make recommendations, YouTube will continue to recommend videos that you may not want in your feed. Regularly removing unwanted videos will keep your feed cleaner and your content focused on the videos you want.

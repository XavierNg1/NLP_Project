 Right when you wake up you should check the new affiliate's website for school delays and cancellations. They should have an accurate list that will normally be refreshed every few minutes for updated information.


You could alternatively turn on the local news. Near the bottom of the screen they’ll show school cancellations and delays based off county districts.If you attend a private school, your school information may not be listed on the news.

, Many schools will send out an automated phone call or email to all student’s homes. If your school does not do this, you can call the school directly or go to its website. Your school should have a inclement weather hotline you can refer to., If you’re not able to get a clear answer, call a friend and ask them if they know any information. Do not call them too early in the morning.


Make sure you can trust your friend. It’d be unfortunate for you to find out school’s cancelled when it isn’t.
 Some local radio stations include delay and cancellation information for schools. Survey through your stations until you get the local news station. You probably won’t hear about school delays from your classic rock station., If all else fails, get ready and go to school like you would on a normal day. If the parking lot is empty, doors are locked etc, then school is most likely closed. Even if your school is open, there is always a chance that you will be sent home early due to inclement weather.


If you weren’t able to get a clear answer, you probably have to go to school.

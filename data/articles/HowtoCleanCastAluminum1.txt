 One of the most effective ways to clean a cast aluminum item is to boil it in a solution of three tablespoons of cream of tartar and four cups of water. You can submerge the item in a pot of this solution. If you want to clean the inside of a pan, boil the solution inside the pan.


Boil the solution on medium high heat for 15 minutes. Then, remove the solution and let the item cool.
You can follow up by scrubbing the item, if necessary. Scrubbing any residue will be much easier thanks to the acidity in the cream of tartar. The cream of tartar can also help to remove any dark or blackened spots on the pan.;
, If there is a lot of residue on a cast aluminum pan or piece of furniture, you can use a toothbrush with soft bristles or a soft, non-abrasive pad to gently scrub the item. You should scrub in gentle, circular motions and be careful not to scrub too hard or with too much pressure as you do not want to scratch or damage the surface of the item.Soaking a pan or small furniture items in cream of tartar and water before scrubbing them can make it easier to remove any residue.
You can try to scrub cast aluminum furniture with a soft toothbrush or a fine scrub pad without soaking it first. One option is to run the garden hose over the furniture to give it a good clean and then scrub it with a fine pad or a toothbrush.Avoid using any metal utensils or steel wool on cast aluminum items. These harsh scrubbing tools can damage the finish., The acidity in the lemon juice can help to loosen up any residue on a pan or furniture. However, be careful not to use too much lemon juice in the soaking solution as too much acidity can damage the cast aluminum surface. Dilute the lemon juice with water using one part lemon juice to four parts water.You can also try another natural acidic product like apple cider vinegar, but make sure you dilute the vinegar with water before soaking the cast aluminum in it or before applying it as a scrub to the furniture.

 The melting temperature and time will be determined by the type of metal you are using. You can also use a blow-torch and small crucible to melt your silver.
 For professional jewelry, you'll need a centrifuge. This evenly distributes the metal quickly, but it is not the only option you have for casting. The more classic, easier solution is to simply pour the metal careful into the tunnel left by the base of the mold.









You could use a large, metal-specific syringe to pump the metal into the mold, too.
 The amount of time it needs to cool is dependent, of course, on the metal melted and used. Dunk too soon and the metal may crack -- dunk too late and it will be hard to remove all the plaster from the hardened metal.









Look up cooling times for your metal before moving on. That said, if you're in a pickle you can just wait 10 minutes and then dunk in cold water.
The plaster should begin dissolving away as you shake it around the cold water.
 Separate the flask from the sprue base and use your fingers or a toothbrush to peel away any last bits stuck to the jewelry.

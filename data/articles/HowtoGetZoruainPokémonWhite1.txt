 This Celebi was a promotional Pokémon distributed in 2011 at GameStop and during a mall tour for Pokémon Black and White. If you didn't pick one up at those events, you will have to borrow one from another player or use action replay cheats to add one to your party.;
, The Relocator allows you to transfer promotional Pokémon into the game. To get the Relocator option added to your menu, follow these steps:

Go to Castelia City and find the Name Rating Services on the left side of the street north of the central plaza.Go to the 11th floor and talk to a scientist in the lower right corner. He will ask you for two sets of passwords.






Answer his questions with "Everyone + Happy" and then "Simple + Connection." This will add the Relocator option to your Main Menu.
 Restart your DS and select the Relocator option from your main menu. Set up the DS wireless connection with another DS system and use the "download play" option to get the promotional Celebi into your system.

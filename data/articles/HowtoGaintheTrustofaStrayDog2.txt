 If you notice that the stray hangs out in a particular place, bring a dish of food there at the same time each day. Put the bowl on the ground, and walk away from it so that the stray will feel that it’s safe to approach.A dry dog kibble will often work fine for a hungry animal. However, if you want to be sure to attract them, you may want to add something that’s irresistibly smelly, like leftover meat or some wet dog food.
Food is the best way of establishing trust since it establishes you as a provider.
 At first, you want to leave the dog to eat the food on their own. Then, see if the dog will eat if you stay and watch from a distance. Each day, move gradually closer to where the dish is located while they eat until you’re standing next to them., Once the dog is at ease with you standing next to them while they eat, try offering them food from your hand. Crouch down so that the dog can eat comfortably from your palm.It may take a while and many attempts for the dog to approach your hand. Give them time to adjust, and go back to standing next to them for that day if they resist what you’re offering a few times.
Once they eat kibble from your hand, consider giving them treats the same way as a reward. If you keep the treats in your pocket, they’ll have your scent on them, which will help further establish trust with the dog.
 After the stray is comfortable eating out of your hand for a few consecutive sessions, you may try reaching out to pet them. Put your hand on the side of their neck or body, and stroke them gently and slowly.Don’t try to petting them on the top of their head since reaching over them can be startling.
To reinforce the sense of trust, reward them with treats with one hand while petting them with the other.

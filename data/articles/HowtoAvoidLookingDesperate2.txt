 Once you’ve determined that someone isn’t interested in you, know when it is time to stop pursuing and time to walk away. Pursuing someone who is not interested may make that person resent you. Also, consider walking away from a relationship that you may be desperate to hold onto.If you consider the following, it might be time to walk away:


You can’t remember the last time you had a meaningful, heart-to-heart talk.
You cannot list what you have in common.
You don’t respect your partner or your partner does not respect you.
You or your partner cannot compromise.
You notice the bad times outweigh the good times.
 Do not stalk the object of your affections on social media or on the internet. Do not post on pictures, posts, or emails. Further, avoid over-analyzing posts made on social media. Other e-stalking behavior may include:


Researching other friends that have reached out to your partner/crush.
Reading his/her e-mail or other correspondence.
Looking through or reading through his/her old posts or pictures.
Reprimanding or “calling him or her out” for talking to other people online.
 You want your partner to feel comfortable in your presence. You do not want to scare him or her away with too much attention. Give him or her some space:


Do not text more than twice in a row or within 10 minutes of last texting him. Try and only text meaningful messages or text when you have a legitimate reason.
Do not get nervous or upset if s/he doesn’t contact you right away.
Do not follow your partner/crush around.
Do not be over accommodating. For example, do not be worried about making friends with your own friends in case your partner may want to hang out or go on a date.

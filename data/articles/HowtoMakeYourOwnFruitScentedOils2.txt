 Place a pot on your stovetop and your jar inside the pot. Fill the pot with enough water to cover most of the jar, but not enough for it to spill inside. Bring the water to the boil. Let the jar sit in boiling water for about ten minutes so it warms up., Transfer your chopped fruit peel to the jar. Then pour the oil in. Use a jar that is narrow enough for the oil to completely cover the fruit peel.For a preservative, add two drops of vitamin E.Then let the filled jar continue to sit in boiling water for an additional ten minutes.


To avoid scalding your hands as you fill the jar, either remove it with tongs or turn the heat off so the water quits bubbling.
 After ten minutes in boiling water, use tongs to remove the jar from the pot. Transfer the jar to an area that receives sunlight. Let it sit there for a couple days. Allow the almond oil some time to extract the fruit essence., Line a strainer with cheesecloth and place the strainer over another container. Pour the liquid from the jar into the strainer. Smell the liquid to gauge the strength of the scent. For a stronger scent, pour the liquid back into the jar and add a fresh Â¼ cup of chopped fruit peel to the oil. Give it another couple of days before testing again.Continue to repeat as desired until the scent matches your preferences.

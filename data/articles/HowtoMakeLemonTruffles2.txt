 Pour your lemon zest and whipping cream into a saucepan over your stovetop. Stir the contents until all of the ingredients are well-mixed. Continue to heat the mixture until small bubbles begin to appear around the edges of your saucepan, then take your pan off of the heat., Once the mixture begins to boil around the edges, pour it through a fine-mesh sieve over a bowl of your white chocolate. This process will start to melt the white chocolate so that you can fully incorporate it into your truffles. Use a spoon to break up larger chunks of white chocolate and whisk the ingredients until your mixture is smooth., Once your chocolate is fully melted, add 10 milliliters (2 teaspoons) of lemon juice and 7g (4 tablespoons) of butter to the bowl. Use a wooden spoon to crush down the butter and mix everything together. Stop mixing once the batter is smooth.
 Spread plastic wrap over the surface of your bowl before putting the batter into the refrigerator. Chilling your truffle mixture will allow the batter to set and become more firm.If you are making truffles for later, you can leave your batter in the fridge overnight.
 Remove the bowl from your refrigerator and use a spoon to scoop some of your truffle mixture onto a cutting board. Roll the dough into 2-inch (5.08 cm) balls by rolling the batter against the cutting board. If the balls are too sticky and the batter is coming off on your hands or cutting board, you can sprinkle powdered sugar onto your board to help you form the balls., Set aside a bowl filled with powdered sugar. Once you've formed the balls, you can carefully roll them in the sugar to coat them. After you coat them, the truffles are ready to eat. You can store truffles in the refrigerator for up to one week after you've made them, but let them warm to room temperature before you eat them.You can also freeze your lemon truffles if you need to store them for a longer period.

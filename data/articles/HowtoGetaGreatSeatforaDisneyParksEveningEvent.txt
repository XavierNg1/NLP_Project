 Usually, if you decide an hour beforehand that you're going to see a show, you will likely end up not getting a good seat, unless the park is not very busy. Therefore, try to look at the schedule before your trip, or at least the day before, and decide that you're going to see the show.
 Whether you are going to Disneyland, Walt Disney World, or one of the other parks, research online: "The best places to view _______ (the name of what event you're seeing)". Most of the time, you will see a list of areas pop up around the park that are the best places for viewing that event. Some of them may even be lesser known, so you may not deal with as big of a crowd., At some parks, some of the shows may offer a dining package, which allows you to eat at a select restaurant, and get a guaranteed seat for the event. They may be a bit more pricey, but if you're willing to spend, then do it., This is especially important if you arrive closer to the event time. You may get taller people in front of you, unfortunately, or you may have parents who put their kids on their shoulders. Therefore, try to pick a good spot that has little chance of getting an obstructed view, and you'll have one of the best seats., If you want the best chance of getting a good spot, plan on arriving an hour before the event, possibly even earlier if the park is more crowded on that day. If you arrive ten minutes before the event is due to start, you're a lot less likely to get a good spot., If you must leave to do something, make sure that it's extremely quick, and try to have another member of your party stay in your spot while you go.

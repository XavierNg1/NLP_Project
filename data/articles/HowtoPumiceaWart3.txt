 This goes for warts on your own body, as well as otherâ€™s warts. Avoid direct contact between a wart and areas where you do not have warts. Touching unimpacted areas may only spread the virus.If you do come into contact with warts or with surfaces that have been touched by someone with warts, make sure to wash your hands and any other exposed areas carefully with soap and hot water.
 Help keep warts from spreading elsewhere on your body or to others by covering your current warts with a bandage or clothing. This can help minimize direct contact with the wart while it heals., Tools including pumice stones, razors, nail files or trimmers, and any other object that comes into contact with an infected area could spread the virus. Be careful sharing or borrowing tools from someone currently treating warts.

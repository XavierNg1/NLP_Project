, As you make the fondant,add the flavoring along with the wet ingredients. Add just a few drops of any flavoring, like mint extract for mint fondant, strawberry extract for strawberry fondant , cocoa powder for chocolate fondant, or you could even use pudding powder to flavor it.
 Depending on how much fondant you make you might want to add a little then taste it becauseÂ  if you don't you may never know if you got the right amount.
 If you want to make your fondant pretty and colorful, add in food coloring.
 Mix it all up and you have delicious flavored fondant!

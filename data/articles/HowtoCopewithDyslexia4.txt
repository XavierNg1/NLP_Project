Use flash cards on a regular basis to familiarize yourself with frequently used words and letter combinations.
Read ‘easy’ text just for the decoding practice. See if you can decrease the amount of time it takes for you to read the text.
Read aloud often. Because of the difficulties with decoding words, reading aloud can be a challenging and sometimes embarrassing experience for people with dyslexia.
 Often when people with dyslexia are writing, they become so focused on spelling words correctly that they lose their train of thought. Try to ignore spelling when you are writing a draft. Focus only on getting your ideas out. Then, go back later and review the document for spelling mistakes.

Flashcards can also serve the dual purpose of reviewing letter sounds and showing what they look like.
 It can also help you manage your time. Reviewing your writing enables you to catch any spelling, grammatical, or other errors.


Think about what your main idea is, what details support it, and how you want to conclude.
Read your writing aloud. It is sometimes easier to spot mistakes this way.
Have someone else read your writing to you so you can hear how your ideas flow together.

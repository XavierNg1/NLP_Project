 Choose a pot that is big enough to hold your entire bronze item. Bring the water to a boil first, and then place your bronze inside the pot. Leave it in the pot for a moment or two, until it is hot.








If your item is too large to fit in a pot of boiling water, consider using a different method to clean it.
 Use tongs to grab the item from the hot water, or use a strainer to drain the water. Place the strainer in the sink, and carefully pour the water from the pot into the strainer. If your bronze item is delicate, be careful not to let it fall too far into the strainer.
 The flannel cloth should be soapy and full of suds. Use it to pick up the warm bronze item, and then rub the item thoroughly with the cloth. Remove any marks or stains with gentle rubbing.








Use a natural, unscented soap. Avoid using alkaline soaps that don't have sodium hydroxide as an ingredient. Also, if your bronze is lacquered, avoid using detergents that have pyrophosphates, such as Tide, or solutions made of ammonia. These can cause the coating on your bronze to deteriorate.Be careful not to burn yourself if the bronze is still very hot. You can use the cloth as a barrier between your skin and the bronze.
 Chamois leather is sheep or lambskin leather that is tanned using natural oils. It is known for being absorbent and non-abrasive, so it will not damage your bronze as you dry it.

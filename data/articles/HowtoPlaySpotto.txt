 This can be anyone, from a friend to a family member. This doesn't have to be a game of only two people playing each other - this can be as many people as you want, as long as they can all fit in the vehicle. You can also play with the driver, although you should let the driver concentrate as well, whilst he/she is driving. You can also play by yourself, although this could get a bit boring!;
, This game is mostly played by children, they will obviously need a person who has qualified for driving and is eligible to drive without a person assisting them. They can play with the driver, but again, as long as they know that they should let the driver concentrate on the driving as well.
 This is known as the scorekeeper. This person can play as well if they want. They can use a pen and paper, write down the names of the people, and write tallies for keeping points.
 Read the next few steps to find the rules.
 An example of this is including more coloured cars that can be counted as points or simply changing the normal yellow coloured car to a blue coloured car. You can also change the amount of points awarded for a car spotted!

, Prepare to face your opponent(s) as well.
, and point to the yellow vehicle so that opponents know it's there, and you're not cheating. Be sure to be quick to tell them, otherwise if nobody sees your proof, you may lose the point by the scorekeeper's rules.
 Do it in a friendly way and, if doing it to a child, don't make them cry!

,, It should be something that is suitable to be a gift, i.e. lollies, chocolates, money, etc.

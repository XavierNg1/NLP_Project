 Due to increasing popularity and demand, Champagnes and sparkling wines are widely available.


Grocery stores and mass marketers may have limited selection, but their wines will typically be more reasonably priced because theyâ€™ll sell more popular wines at a higher volume.
Local liquor stores usually have a section devoted to Champagne and sparkling wine. The staff may be able to offer suggestions, and the wines may be classified by country of origin.
Wine stores are your best option for truly learning about the different types of sparkling wines available. Many wine stores offer tastings and classes.
 Once you have found a reputable local wine seller, invest the time in getting to know them and their products. Staff at these stores are usually quite enthusiastic about sharing their information with others.
 Occasionally, online retailers may be your best option for sourcing rare, hard-to-find varieties or very high-end brands. Check the laws in your state, however, as some forbid buying alcohol by mail.
 Each of the 50 states currently has at least one winery, and local vintners offer a variety of tours, tastings, and events which can be helpful as you explore the world of sparkling wines.

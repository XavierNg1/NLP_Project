 Make sure the paste is thick, similar to the consistency of toothpaste. You want the paste thick enough so that it can stick to the sides of your tub.If your paste is thin, then just add more baking soda until it forms a thick paste.
 Apply the paste to both the sides and bottom of the tub. Then let the paste set for 30 minutes.Depending on how dirty your tube is, you may need to let the paste set for a longer amount of time, like an hour or so.
 Do this once the paste has set for the allotted time. Use a nylon brush to scrub the paste off to avoid scratching your tub., Using a bucket or a showerhead, make sure to rinse it thoroughly until the residue is gone. Then dry your tub with a clean towel., Dip a cotton ball or a clean, white cloth in the nail polish remover. Gently rub the tough stains individually until they are gone. Wipe the areas with a clean, wet cloth, and then dry them with a clean towel.Alternatively, you can use turpentine to remove tough stains.

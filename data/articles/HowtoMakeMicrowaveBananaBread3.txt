 Pour the coconut flour and baking powder into the mug. Stir them together using a fork or mini whisk.
 You can use almond milk or coconut milk. You can also try another type of vegan friendly milk as well, such as soy milk. Stir the batter once more.

Allergic to nuts? Try soy nut butter or sunflower seed butter instead., Keep mixing until everything is evenly combined. Make sure that you scrape the bottom and sides of the mug often so that nothing gets left behind.
 How long this takes depends on the strength of your microwave and the type of mug you are using.As the bread cooks, it may start to rise a little, but it will deflate once you stop the microwave.

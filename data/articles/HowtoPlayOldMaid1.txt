 This number of players can easily play using a single deck of cards.


If you have more players, use two decks but make sure the decks look identical.;
, The other Queen will be designated as the "Old Maid."


The goal of the game is to avoid being the player who holds the "Old Maid" in your hand when all the cards have been discarded.
 The dealer will shuffle the cards and deal the cards as evenly as possible amongst the players.


Some players may have one card more than others. This is fine.

 Have a standard VGA cable on hand; it should come with the projector. If you don’t have one, you can purchase one from your local electronics store. You can’t connect the VGA cable directly to your iPhone. You’ll need an Apple VGA-to-Lightning adapter first, which is available at Apple stores.


Note that this adapter is different for iPhone 5, 5S, 6, 6 Plus (models after November 2012), and iPhone 4, 4S (models before November 2012). The adapter for iPhone 4, 4S is called VGA-to-30 Pin adapter.;
, The VGA cable is the projector cable that is plugged into the computers. Connect that cable to one end of your VGA-to-Lightning adapter. Tighten the cores of the VGA cable so that it stays connected properly.
 Connect the other end of the adapter to your iPhone. It will go in the charging socket of your iPhone. Once done, your iPhone will be connected to the main system of the projector.
 Connect the audio cable of the Projector to the iPhone. This cable will fit in the headphone jack of your iPhone. This will enable the audio of your presentation, if it has one.
 When your projector is switched to the correct input, you’ll see your iPhone screen on the projector display. You can navigate your iPhone as normal and the screen will be mirrored through the projector. Open the app that contains what you want to share and give your presentation.


Open to the first screen of your presentation before switching the projector to the correct input. This will ensure that the audience only sees what you want them to see.

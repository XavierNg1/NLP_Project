 These are pastas made from semolina flour. The color of such pasta will be light gold or yellow. Most European pasta is made from semolina flour and Italian pasta still proves to be a firm favorite with many pasta devotees.;
, Cook a small amount of your selected pasta to discern its quality. Good quality pasta will not stick together when it cooks. If your spaghetti is sticking together as you cook it, change brands.
 It may be a personal taste but there is a real difference in both taste and texture between fresh pasta and dried pasta. Fresh pasta will likely have a softer texture and breaks more easily, especially under the weight of heavy sauces. Fresh pasta is best for pastas with fillings, such as tortellini, ravioli etc. Dried pasta is best for non-filled pasta such as spaghetti, penne and rigatoni.
 Thick and chunky sauces are best for thick and substantial pasta types, such as penne, conchiglie, rigatoni or fusilli. Light and delicate pasta should only be graced by light sauces or even olive oil with fresh garlic and herbs. Use your common sense.

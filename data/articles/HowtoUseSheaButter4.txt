 You can make some luxurious and moisturizing shaving cream using shea butter and a few other ingredients. Here is what you will need:1/3 cup coconut oil
1/3 cup shea butter
Â¼ cup olive oil

, Put the pot on the stove, and set the heat to "low." Drop in your oil and butter and wait for both to melt. Be sure to stir every so often so that they melt evenly. Because of their low melting points, this should not take long.
 Once the coconut oil and shea butter have melted, lift the pot off the stove and transfer everything into a heat-safe bowl. Add in the olive oil and stir to blend everything together. The liquid will look translucent.
 As the oils and butters harden, they will turn an opaque yellow color. Consider labeling this bowl so that someone does not mistake your shaving cream for butter and eat it.
 You can do this by using a hand mixer, or a food processor with a whisk attachment. This should take about three minutes.
 Because of the low-melting points of coconut oil and shea butter, you will need to store your shaving cream in a cool, dry place.

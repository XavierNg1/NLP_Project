 Most U.S. homeowner's insurance policies cover two types of natural disasters--wildfires and tornadoes. Hurricanes are more difficult to categorize; the damage from wind and rain during a hurricane is usually covered, but flooding is not.For example, if the wind from a hurricane broke your windows and the rain damaged your floor, both of those types of damage would be covered. If the rain overloaded the storm drains in your neighborhood and resulted in a flood, that would not be covered.
 While insurance is supposed to protect you against loss, not every policy values reimbursements equally. There are a few different ways an insurer will value your items: actual cash value, replacement value, and extended replacement value.Actual cash value reimburses the owner for the current cash value of the item. This is usually the stingiest method of reimbursement, because most things depreciate in value rather than appreciate. So if your 5-year old mattress was destroyed in a fire, the insurer won't reimburse for what it costs to go find a new mattress, but for the value of a five year old mattress.
Replacement value doesn't factor in depreciation,meaning it's a more generous method of reimbursement.
Extended replacement value is a method of reimbursement which reimburses for the cost of replacement plus an extra percentage.
 There are a number of ways to keep your premiums low that don't involve raising your deductible. These include installing safety devices, bundling, and retrofitting your home.Safety devices that can result in big savings include smoke detectors, sprinkler systems, and fire extinguishers.
Bundling insurance means carrying multiple types of insurance with one carrier. You can usually get a discount the more policies you carry at a time.
Retrofits that can lower a premium include replacing single pane glass windows with double pane glass, and fire resistant roofing materials, like metal roofing.

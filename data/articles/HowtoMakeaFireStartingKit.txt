 These are listed below under "Things You'll Need".
 While optional, this makes it a cleaner way to work, especially as you will be working with dripping wax.
 Do this as follows:


Light the candle and let the wax melt a little.
Dip a match into the wax; be careful not to light the match in the flame.
Let the wax dry on the red part of the match.
 Soak the cotton balls in the alcohol and let them dry.
 Put the matches on one side. Then, put the cotton balls in the bag, roll the baggie up, and push into the case.
 This will be used to strike each match.
 The fire starting kit is all set to go.
 If your matches are not the "strike anywhere" kind, this striker will be required to provide the second half of the two-part match/striker system. As opposed to the sandpaper used above, this striker is NOT just a friction source. It is half of a two part chlorate / phosphorus ignition system.

 As you finish up for the day or complete your project, use up as much paint on your roller as possible. The less paint on your roller, the easier the clean-up process will be. Roll excess paint from your roller onto newspapers, cardboard or any other disposable surface.;
, Latex paint and oil-based paints require different methods of cleaning the rollers.


Wash latex paint from your roller with soapy water. Submerge the paint roller in a bucket of soapy water, swirl the roller around and squeeze excess paint from the roller with your hand. Empty the water, refill the bucket and repeat the process until the roller water rinses nearly clear.






Clean oil-based paint from rollers with paint thinner. Wearing gloves to protect your hands, pour paint thinner into a clean paint tray, and roll the roller in the paint thinner several times. When mostly clean, submerge the roller in a bucket of warm, soapy water to clean it for reuse.
 Cut off the side of an ordinary clothes hanger. Attach the roller to the bottom part of the hanger to dry. Drying the roller this way helps to save the nap, which keeps it fluffy for the next time you wish to use the roller. A roller with smashed nap may paint unevenly.
 Insert the roller into a large, food storage bag and seal it. If you don't have a food storage bag large enough to fit the roller, use a plastic grocery sack and tie it closed. By sealing or tying the bag closed, you keep the roller clean and dust-free for future use.

 Orient it vertically. You can use a different sized piece of felt, but it needs to be a rectangle, and oriented vertically, with one of the narrow ends facing you., You can fold it up by more to make a deeper bag, but this will make the top flap shorter., Lift the bottom flap up and run a line of hot glue down the edge. Quickly press the flap back down and run your finger along the edge. Repeat this step on the other side for the other edge., If you'd like to, you can cut the top flat into a V shape so that it looks more like an envelope. This is not absolutely necessary, but it can give your bag a nice touch. You can also cut the flap shorter, if you'd like to.
 You don't have to do this, but it will make your bag look more professional. It will also help keep it shut. Place one piece on the bag itself, and the other piece on the underside of the flap.


You can use self-adhesive Velcro or regular Velcro. If you are using regular Velcro, you will need to glue it in place.
 You can leave your bag as it is, or you can embellish it further. Here are some ideas:


Trim the sides down with pining sheers for an interesting touch.
Straight stitch or blanket stitch along the edges with embroidery floss.
Cut a strip of contrasting felt, and hot glue it down onto the top flap.Embellish the flap with felt bows, flowers, or other felt shapes.

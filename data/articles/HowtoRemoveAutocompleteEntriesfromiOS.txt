 The one you choose to open will depend on your current preferences. Some typical autocomplete fields are in the following places:


Messages - Tap the New Message icon in the top right corner of your screen.
Mail - Tap the New Email icon in the bottom right corner of your screen.;
,, Again, what you choose to type here will vary depending on your situation.


For example, if you're trying to remove "wikiHow" from your frequent searches in Mail, you might type "wiki" here.
 This should be to the right of your entry.
 This button's location will change depending on the app you're using.


For example, the Mail app's "Remove" button says Remove From Recents and it's at the bottom of the page.
The iMessage Remove option, on the other hand, is in the top right corner of the page.
 You can remove any entries you wish to remove in this fashion.

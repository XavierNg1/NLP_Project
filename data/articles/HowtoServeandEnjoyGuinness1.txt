 Although it may seem that any glass will do, to enjoy a truly perfect glass of Guinness you must use a tulip glass.


The shape of a tulip glass is perfect for allowing the nitrogen bubbles to circulate from the bottom and back up to the top.
Although any size will do, a 16oz glass, otherwise known as a pint, is generally agreed upon as the classic size for the drink.;
, Pour until the glass is about Â¾ of the way full, in one slow smooth pour.


Using the 45 degree angle keeps the Guinness from frothing and allows for a better head.
Be sure to keep from pouring straight down, as it will create a fisheye in the top of the foam and large unwanted bubbles, After pouring, let the Guinness set for a minute or two so the head can develop. The nitrogen bubbles become distressed by the movement of the pour, and will gather in a creamy foam at the top of the drink when allowed time to settle.
 Fill the glass the rest of the way up, so that a dome effect is created at the top of the glass.
 Although good on its own, try the beer paired with seafood for a delicious combination.

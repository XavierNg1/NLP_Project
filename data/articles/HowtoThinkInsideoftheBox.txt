,,, This is the "box" in which you must work your solution. If you are drawing these boundaries, be careful where you draw it, and be aware of what can and cannot be moved, if necessary, about them.
 Can some components of your problem be postponed until later in the project? Must some of the components be solved before other components can be solved?

, Ask yourself why each of these solutions failed. Many times a solution fails because of lack of persistence. You need to hit a nail more than once before it is driven into place.


Before discarding a possible solution that has failed, consider whether your situation is different somehow. Have technologies, attitudes, or conditions changed? Is yours a slightly different problem?

, Write down every idea regardless of merit and filter them later. Remember that it is easier to have too many ideas to choose from than not enough.



Keep a notebook and pen with you at all times. Jot down as many ideas as they come to you, whether or not they are "good".
Think about your goal and the components of the problem when you have idle time, such as during travel time, exercise, coffee breaks or even routine meetings.
Look to your supervisors, coworkers and companions for input. Accept every suggestion. You do not need to create your own solution, but can freely adopt and adapt a solution that has worked for someone else.
Work backwards. Consider resources or solutions open to you and ask whether and how they could move you toward your goal.
 Include estimated budget requirements.
 Re-write and re-phrase solutions. Organize the list, grouping the most viable solutions together.
 Present it. Implement it.

 Look at what cards the machine reader will take. Most snack vending machines don't take ATM cards, despite their VISA associations behind the scenes, and this should be stated on their ATM card reader on the machine itself.;
, All credit and debit cards (which come from a bank) have one of a variety of insignias (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express, etc.). See if this insignia on the card matches one of the insignias stated on or near the card reader.
 You'll sometimes see the card reader to say to swipe with the magnetic strip to the left and sometimes the magnetic strip to the right.
 Most often times, at this point the screen says approved, the vending machine company has placed a temporary authorization payment on the account to ensure there really is money in the account and that they are able to take the money from you at any given time.
 Type in the numbers on the keypad you are given near the reader to make your selection, just as you would have had you had cash and/or change.
 Most companies will combine your charges into one combined larger charge

, This is a critical step that most first-time users tend to forget to do when using a vending machine with this type of payment form.

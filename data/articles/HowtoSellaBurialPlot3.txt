 There are many options for selling a burial plot online. You can use a specialized service, such as Grave Solutions or Plot Brokers, or place your own ad on free websites like Craigslist and Ebay.Placing your own ad can be advantageous, as there are no fees or costs to the seller.Working through a brokerage service can also be advantageous, as they take much of the work out of selling your plot. Brokerage services typically charge either a monthly advertising fee, a percentage of the final transaction, or a combination of the two., It may sound a bit strange, but photographs can be an important factor in a buyer's decision. Many burial plot listings feature descriptions paired with photographs so that prospective buyers can get a comprehensive understanding of the plot before they decide to purchase it.Some people want a plot that is in a shaded area, for example, while others may worry about whether or not the plot location is prone to flooding.
 Your ad should clearly state the name of the cemetery, as well as the section, plot, and grave number.You should include photographs, if you have any, and a thorough description of what a seller can expect from your burial plot. The advertisement should also include your asking price for the plot, though many sellers end up offering some room for negotiation., It's best to bring in a lawyer to help with the paperwork, as there will be a great deal of variance from one county, state, or country to another. Different municipalities have different requirements. Generally speaking, the paperwork you use to complete the sale should specify the location of the burial plot and a clear transfer of ownership. You may wish to secure a signature from a cemetery representative as well, so that the buyer feels comfortable with the purchase he is making.

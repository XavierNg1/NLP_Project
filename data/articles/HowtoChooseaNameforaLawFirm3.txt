 If you specialize in criminal law, family law, tax law or other areas, consider choosing a name that reflects your area of legal expertise.


For example, The Davis Family Law Group signals that your firm specializes in family law.
 A long name might be used professionally, and then shortened when used in marketing and advertising materials.


For example, a firm legally called Legacy Tax & Trust could simply be called Legacy by its clients and partners.
 If the branding associated with your firm name is extremely distinctive, you may consider trademarking the firm name and the brand.


To trademark your business name, simply visit the United States Patent and Trademark Office website. There is a form available online that will register your trademark. Download this form and fill it out.
The form will require you to provide information about your business.
Additionally, the fee to trademark a business name is between $275 and $325.

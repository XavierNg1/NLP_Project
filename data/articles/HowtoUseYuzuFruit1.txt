 Fresh yuzu fruit is hard to come by outside of East Asia. Depending on your location, you might be able to find fresh fruit at a nearby Asian grocery store. Bottled yuzu juice, also available at your Asian grocery store, is more widely available., You will likely find both pure yuzu juice and concentrated products. Concentrates or seasonings containing yuzu are far less potent than pure juice so, in general, you should choose 100% yuzu juice.After opening, you can refrigerate bottled yuzu juice for up to four weeks.
 Yuzu is less acidic, but more intensely flavorful than other citruses, like lemon or lime. It’s potent enough that just one drop goes a long way. Try using a few drops of yuzu juice wherever you’d use a teaspoon of citrus juice, such as in ceviches or seafood marinades., Yuzu, like other citrus fruits, works well in both savory and sweet dishes. You can add a dash to sweet recipes, such as jellies, custards, or meringues.Try making an easy yuzu glaze for cakes by mixing 2 cups (480 mL) of confectioner’s sugar with two teaspoons of yuzu juice. Add more juice for more intense citrus flavor and, if necessary, to thin the glaze’s consistency.

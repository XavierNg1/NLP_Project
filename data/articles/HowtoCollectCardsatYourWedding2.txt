 Having a special place where guests can leave cards means they won’t get lost or damaged during your reception. It also allows guest to drop off cards at the beginning of the event, rather than carrying them around until the evening’s end. If you choose to collect cards in a card box, make sure you place the box in a secure location that is also accessible to guests. Place the card box on a table that is not near any of the exits, which will make it more challenging for a thief to make a mad dash with your cash.
 You can use the same table as a place for your guest book and as a drop-off place for gifts other than cards, or you can designate an entirely different space for guests to leave their cards. Make it clear that guests should place their cards there. For example, you can decorate with a creative sign that reads, "Cards." You can also decorate the space with photos of the couple, flowers, or any other decor that matches your wedding theme.
 If you decide to collect cards out in the open, such as in a card box or on a card table, make sure you have someone watching over the space. Cards often contain cash and can be easily snatched by a wedding thief. Having someone keep an eye on your cards can prevent theft.


Try asking a trusted friend, family member, or wedding staff to watch over the card box.

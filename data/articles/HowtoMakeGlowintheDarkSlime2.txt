 You can also use less cornstarch to produce a more watery slime.









Because you’re using cornstarch rather than borax or liquid starch, this slime is a safe alternative for small children.
 Stir with a spoon or with hands to combine.
 Continue stirring until the desired consistency is achieved. Glow-in-the-dark craft paint is available at most craft stores as well as in the crafting section of many major stores.









As an alternative to glow-in-the-dark paint, you can instead use the ink from a highlighter to color your slime. Pry off the bottom of a highlighter and drop the ink filament that’s inside the highlighter tube into the bowl of water and cornstarch. With a gloved hand, squeeze the filament to extract the ink.Note that if using highlighter ink, it may only glow under a blacklight.
You can also add drops of food coloring to change the hue of the slime, just remember that the food coloring may make the slime glow a little less.
 Enjoy your glow-in-the-dark slime!

 It’s important to take breaks, especially if you plan on skiing for an extended period of time. Every hour or two, it may be a good idea to reenergize and warm up.


Find a place that is warm (preferably indoors). Going indoors periodically can help your body warm up. You can take off your ski boots and gloves and warm up your fingers and toes by placing them near a heat source or simply rubbing them. This helps recirculate the blood flow in your frigid fingers and toes and can help you feel more comfortable when you go back outside to ski.






Refuel. Skiing takes a lot out of you. Your body may be tired and needs a snack or lunch to reenergize before going back to the slopes again. Also often times when you are hungry, your body tends to feel colder than when your hunger is satisfied. A good idea could be to drink hot soup or hot chocolate to satiate your hunger as well as warming up your insides!






Dry your wet ski clothes and boots. Invest in a boot dryer or find a heat source to warm up and dry your wet boots, socks, and gloves. Skiing in wet gear is not fun or comfortable, so it may be a good idea to take a break and draw out the moisture from your clothes.
 Often times when skiers are cold, they clench their toes when they are cold. This actually doesn’t work because it restricts blood flow in your feet and cause your toes to become even colder. A good way to warm yourself up while you’re on the slopes is to swing your feet back and forth on the lift to warm up your lower body and circulate blood back to your feet.
 When you are feeling extremely uncomfortable because you’re very wet or cold and it’s difficult to find a warm indoors area to rest and warm up, having extra supplies in your ski jacket to warm your body up would be helpful. Be careful not to pack too many supplies in your ski jacket that would prevent mobility and comfort while skiing.

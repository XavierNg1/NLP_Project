 Cats don’t enjoy loud or surprising noises. Try to minimize loud sounds when you enter the cat’s space for the first time. If you have crinkly shopping or grocery bags with you, for example, leave them outside, so you don’t frighten the cat.If you are bringing loud or rambunctious children into the house, ask them to be quiet or take them to another part of the house where they can wait with a trusted adult.;
, People tower over cats, and sometimes a cat may get underfoot by accident. If appropriate, remove your shoes so you don’t risk stepping on the cat’s tail. Some shoes, particularly high heels, make loud sounds when you walk. Removing them will also help keep the environment quiet and stress-free for the cat., Direct eye contact can be intimidating for cats or even be interpreted as a sign of aggression. Avoid looking directly at the cat, and instead ignore them when first entering their space., The specific cat’s temperament will play a large part in whether they want to interact with you or not. If the owner is around, ask them if their cat is typically friendly or if they prefer their space.You could say, “I love cats. Is your cat usually interested in meeting new people?”

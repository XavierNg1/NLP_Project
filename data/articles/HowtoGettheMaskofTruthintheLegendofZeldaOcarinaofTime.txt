 Make sure you are Child Link, and make sure you have completed the first three dungeons- In The Great Deku Tree, Dodongo's Cavern, and In Jabu-Jabu's Belly. Also make sure that you have talked to the guard guarding the Death Mountain entrance and that he has mentioned a mask to you, and that you know Saria's Song.;
, The owner will explain the system of "borrowing" the masks and bringing money back so you can get the new mask. Borrow the Keaton Mask, the one that looks like a fox. Give it to the guard near Death Mountain Trail's entrance. Go back to the mask shop.
 Go to the Lost Woods. At the entrance, go left. You will encounter a Skull Kid playing a flute. Face him, and speak to him with the mask on. He will ask you about the mask, and will buy it off you. He pays you less than it's worth, though. Go back to the Mask Shop.
 Make sure it's daytime. Go to the Graveyard. You'll encounter a little kid pretending to be the gravekeeper. Wear the mask and talk to him. He'll buy the mask off you for full price. Go back to the Mask Shop.
 Go out to Hyrule Field. If it's nighttime, search for a guy in a toga-like outfit sitting on the ground near Gerudo Valley. If it's daytime, search for the same guy running. When you do finally track him down, talk to him with the mask on. He'll get excited and buy the mask for way more than it's worth by filling up your wallet. Go to the Mask Shop.
 You can also borrow the Zora Mask, the Gerudo Mask, and the Goron mask, which are just for show. You can borrow the others as well.

 Pressing flowers is done best with small, flat flowers, such as pansies and lilacs. Stay away from flowers with fleshy stems or extra-thin petals, which can end up damaged., Place your flowers on a matte, non-glossy paper such as newspaper, cardboard, or tissue paper. Arrange your flowers in a single layer, then place another sheet of dry paper over the top.


The more absorbent materials you use, the better your flowers will turn out. Try placing the flowers between newspaper, the newspaper between blotter paper, and the blotter paper between corrugated cardboard. Tape the whole pile shut., Place them under something that has a large, evenly dispersed weight. Typically, dictionaries or encyclopedias are a good option for this, but you could also use heavy boxes or pieces of wood.


Keep the stack in a warm, dry place.
 After the first week, remove the flowers and replace the paper with fresh, dry sheets. Then put the flowers back under the weights to continue pressing them.
 After the flowers have been left for a few weeks, take off the weights and papers and pull out your flowers. They should be crisp and paper-thin, and transparent to light.

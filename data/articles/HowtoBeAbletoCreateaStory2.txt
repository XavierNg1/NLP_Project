 Spend time in public places, surreptitiously watching people and making up stories for them. Write down descriptions of their appearance, their mannerisms, their voices, what they were saying and what they were doing. Then take those stories and make them longer and more intricate.


Put people that you see into the same story, even if they aren't interacting in real life.
 Obviously be safe while doing this, but talk to random people. Get insights into their lives and what they're doing. Even a simple discussion about the weather can give you insight into a person.


Do they mumble? Do they meet your eye or do they look anywhere but you? How is their body language?






Using what you've observed, write a story about them, using the mannerisms and descriptions that you've noticed about them.
 You will find the most amazing and bizarre names in the phone book. Look through it and pick out the best ones. Write stories with characters based on the names that you've discovered.
 The best stories do seem to come from real life events and experiences (as they say "Truth is stranger than fiction") so read lots of nonfiction, especially if you're a fiction writer. Read histories of all different countries and time periods and build stories based on the things that happen. Read science books and medical books. Read about seafarers, and potential witches.


Pick out the facts and things that most interest you and build stories based on them. For instance, you could take something as simple as a decommissioned lighthouse in Maine and turn it into an epic tale of good and evil.

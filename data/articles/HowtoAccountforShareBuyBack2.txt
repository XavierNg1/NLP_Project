 Multiply the number of shares by the price per share to determine the amount of money you will have to pay out. If you were buying back 10,000 shares with a par value of $1 originally sold for $12 each at $15 per stock, you would pay out $150,000., You will need to list the common stock as a debit for the par value, so 10,000 shares with a par value of $1 would be listed as "common stock, par value $1" with a debit amount of $10,000. Notate the original sale price minus the par value as additional paid-in capital.Since the 10,000 shares in the example were originally sold at $12 per share, the additional paid-in capital debit amount would be $110,000.
The remaining $30,000 from the 10,000 shares bought back at $15 per share will be notated as a retained earnings debit.
Finish the notation with a cash credit in the full amountâ€”the example would be a cash credit of $150,000.
 Using the constructive retirement method for the buy back of shares eliminates the common stock and additional paid-in capital amounts so they can be written in as a credit along with the retained earnings. This method is used when it is assumed that the stock will not be reissued.

Loosely curl 3-inch sections of hair at a time.;

Messy hair is wanted for this style., Separate a 1-inch section of hair from your ponytail. Wrap the section around the base of the ponytail—around the elastic specifically. Secure the band with a couple of bobby pins underneath the ponytail., Use a texture product again, like sea salt spray, to give your hair more movement. Adjust the ponytail to make it as messy as you’d like. You can scrunch, twirl, massage your hair for a more tousled look.

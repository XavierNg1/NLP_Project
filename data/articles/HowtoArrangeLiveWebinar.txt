Think of a webinar host as connecting at least two, and perhaps hundreds, of persons speaking and sharing by using your and their computer screens, sharing a PowerPoint (PPT) presentation (or other application) with colleagues or several associates while you talk them through the presentation. With a webinar, your client -- or hundreds of them -- can not only watch your presentation while you share it, but can also listen to you as you walk them through your presentation. The wonderful thing is that (a) your friends, associates, or potential clients can be anywhere in the world, (b) you can still have a dialogue or exchange of questions and answers during your webinar and, (c) in just about all cases only you need all the materials and the presentation software that you are sharing with them.
 (1) Since a webinar is dependent on the internet, all the participants must have access to it and should have good connectivity. (2) Before you conduct the webinar, you need to prepare strong, useful, composite visual and verbal materials that are required by the audience to be sure your message will be understood.
 Similarly if you have hired consultants to help you with your companyâ€™s growth or need them for competitive benchmarking, you can use the webinar to get the information presented to you, to understand them easily.

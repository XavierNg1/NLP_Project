Not everyone who uses Snapchat has a phone number associated with their account. The other users must have enabled this feature on their own Snapchat accounts in order to be matched on your list.
 This will open a new screen with your current Snapchat friends., This will display a list of people in your phone's contacts list that have their phone number associated with their Snapchat account., When you open this tab for the first time, you may be prompted by Snapchat to allow access to your device's contacts. This will allow Snapchat to check which of your contacts have their phone numbers associated with Snapchat profiles., The person you add will be added to your friends list, and notified that you've added them. They'll then be able to add you back if they want.Snapchat only matches people based on phone numbers. It does not match by name, email address, or other social media accounts like Twitter or Facebook.

You can tap "+Invite" to send them a text with a link to the Snapchat app.
 You may need to be added back by the person you added to your friends list before you can start communicating. This depends on the other person's privacy settings. Your messages will be stuck "Pending" until you are added back.

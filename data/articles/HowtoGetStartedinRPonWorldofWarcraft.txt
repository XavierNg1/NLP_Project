 It sounds boring but this is where a lot of new Role-players make mistakes. Reading about the lore of certain events and how they happened can give you a good backbone to creating your character.;
, When you decide to make your character, make sure you pick and appropriate name for your race. A Human Male is less likely to go around with a name like "Pwnzer" or "Leetkilla" if they are role playing, It is more likely you will see names like "Harrisone" or "Johnstone." Picking a good name gives you a good impression and make you look like you have done this before.
 Double Brackets are your friend. Double Brackets are used as a form of communicating to people OOC (Out of Character) it is a very useful emote that can help you in situations. Example: Character 1: I have another important matter to attend to. Character 1: ((gtg I need to go to the shops. )) They are a really useful thing to learn straight off.
 If you use Curse Client you should get a few addons specifically made for Roleplaying, A couple of good ones include; Total RP 2, GryphonHeart Items, My RolePlay. These can be used to create or add extra information to your character.
 Even if you are roleplaying, most people are probably more interested in getting Rep or farming gold. Don't pester them to Roleplay with you because it will make you look stupid and needy for attention. Invite people nicely to roleplay and be prepared for them to say no.
 Okay now this subject if tricky. A lot of people who do roleplaying for a while will have (at one point) had an in game relationship with another character. If you feel like you want to have an in game relationship with someone, Ask the OOC first before rushing in, make sure you and and the other person are comfortable with it

, The main point of roleplaying is to have fun with your friends and learn more about the world of warcraft. It's nice for you to make new friends and to have in game relationships with them.

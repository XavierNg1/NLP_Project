 You will want to avoid over serving your guests during the appetizer. In order to accomplish this, you should plan to serve about 1 to 2 ounces (28 to 57 grams) of cheese per guest. Ultimately, the amount of cheese you will serve is going to depend on how many guests you invite.For example, if your dinner party includes eight people, you will want to make sure that you serve at least 16 ounces (454 grams) of cheese.
 You should slice firmer cheeses before serving them to your guests. With the harder cheese in particular, you do not want your guests struggling to cut off slices on the tray. Make things easy for your guests by slicing or breaking off chunks of the cheese beforehand.Hard and semi-hard cheeses include gouda, cheddar, Swiss and parmesan.
Semi-soft cheeses include bleu cheese, Monterey Jack and Havarti.
Exposure to the air can really enhance the flavor of certain semi-hard cheeses.
 Leave soft cheeses in their rind and do not cut into them before you serve them. Because your guests will want to spread these cheeses on crackers and breads, you should serve them whole with a knife. The interior of some of these cheeses is runny so you will want to keep it whole until you serve your guests.Soft cheeses include brie and camembert.
The rind is the firm exterior of the cheese. With many soft cheeses, the rind is edible.
 Because cold mutes flavor, you will want to make sure that you serve your cheeses at room temperature. Be sure to remove your cheeses from the refrigerator at least an hour before serving them. Some harder cheeses may need two hours to properly warm up and aerate.Make sure you do not set out your cheeses in a warm room. This can cause them to melt.

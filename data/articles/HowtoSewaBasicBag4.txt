 Choose the fabric you like, or use fabric you have spare from your fabric stash.


You will also need a piece of string, ribbon or cord (or anything that is similar).
 Both pieces must be the exact same size but the size is up to your needs.
 Face the two pieces wrong-side inwards. Then sew along three sides, leaving one end open (this is where the drawstring will go). Then turn the fabric bag out the right way.
 Next, you'll add the drawstring feature.
 Cut like this all around the edge of the pouch, about 2 inches/5cm from the top of the pouch.
 Work the string/ribbon all the way around the top of the bag.
 You can tie it closed.
 You've created a drawstring pouch.

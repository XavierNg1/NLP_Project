 Many universities have a more open approach to providing scholarly articles to the general public. You may be able to access scholarly articles through the library's website even if you aren't a current student at that school.Check colleges and universities near you as well. That way it won't be inconvenient if you end up having to go to the library to look at articles you've found online.
Even universities that don't have open access to their databases may still have open access to the general public if you use a computer in the library itself.
 Different libraries will have different databases of scholarly journals and other scholarly publications. Typically these databases cover particular fields or disciplines.Look for a tab that says "research," "online resources," or something similar. Even if the library allows the general public to access the databases, you may have to create a user account.
 When searching library databases, you'll typically get better results using advanced search options than a plain language search like you would use for a general internet search engine.If you've never used this particular database, familiarize yourself with the search terms. While they'll generally be the same, there may be some differences from one library system to another.
Typically you'll also have the option of limiting your results. For example, you may be able to check a box if you want your search to return only peer-reviewed articles.
 When you submit your search, you'll get back a list of related scholarly articles. Typically the search results will give you the name and author of the article along with publication information.In an open access library, you can click on the title of an article to read the full text of the article. In other libraries, clicking on the title may lead you only to an abstract. If you think the article would be helpful for your project based on the abstract, you typically can access the full text by going to the library.

 This is the most important part, but not the only part, of course.;
, Don't eat any food with a stench that morning or at school. Chew gum or pop a tic tac before if you'd like.
 Dress in clean, presentable, uniquely you but still appropriate for school.
,, Lay on your back, you entire body completely comfortable and sinking into whatever you're laying on (mattress, bed...). Think about how it's just another first day out of so many, how everyone else going to your school are just like you and you shouldn't be intimidated by them, think about how you're going to meet a lot of new friends and have new adventures with them. You're the new girl - you have an opportunity to practically start over and be accepted for who you really are. People are going to get to know you without the backstory of what has happened the years before.
 People will be attracted to you for being so confident.
, Always be nice, polite, and be yourself and be relevant (make relevant jokes, make relevant observations...). Don't gossip, especially if they don't start. it's a dangerous game to play right away, you don't know what they know.
, Don't stick to one group of kids right away, you may be missing out before you even got to know others.

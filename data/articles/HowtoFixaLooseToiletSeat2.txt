 If the bolts are damaged, then you may just want to replace the individual pieces but leave the seat intact. If the body of the seat itself is in poor shape, however, then you may just want to swap it out for the sake of longevity. Look for toilet seats at a local hardware or home-and-garden store.
 There are two standard commercial toilet seat shapes: round and elongated. The round seats are perfectly round, while the "elongated" seats are oblong and egg-shaped. Buy the seat that matches your bowl.


Try to find a seat made by the same company that manufactured your toilet. Off-brand seats may well do the trick, but they may not fit quite so perfectly.
 You will need to unscrew the old seat, set it aside, and then tighten the new seat onto the bowl. Make sure that the new seat is aligned straight onto the toilet!


Save the bolts and nuts from the old seat in case you need to replace a bolt on your new seat.

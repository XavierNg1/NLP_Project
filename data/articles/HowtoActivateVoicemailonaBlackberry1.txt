, You will hear several beeps and then an automated voice. This is a one-time setup that you will only hear when you first activate your phone.
 If you want English, press "1" and then "#" to select it. If you want another language, wait for the prompt and then press the number followed by the "#" key.
 This can be any combination of numbers, but it should be difficult for someone to guess. Write down this number in a safe place in case you forget it. You will have to enter in this password if you need to listen to your voicemail from another phone, but you won't need to type it in if you are checking messages from your Blackberry.
, If you want to use the standard, canned greeting, press "1." If you want to create your own personalized greeting, press "2."

, You might record something like, "You have reached XYZ. Please leave a message after the beep and I will get right back to you." When you are satisfied with your greeting, press the "#" key. Follow the prompts if you want to re-record your greeting. There is no limit to the number of times you can record a greeting.

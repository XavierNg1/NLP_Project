Enjoy sage, rosemary, basil or other herbs in your kitchen.Avoid north facing windows for indoor kitchen herb gardens. They do not provide enough light.

On another table, you could put glass jars with sand and air plants or succulents on top., You could place a small cactus on your home office table. If you are more ambitious, you could create a small cactus garden with different sized and shaped cacti in your living room. Play around with the shapes and sizes of the cacti. It might be best to place the small cacti in front of the larger cacti, so you get a sense of depth in your cactus garden., You can purchase a weekly flower delivery service so that you can look forward to fresh cut flowers every week.

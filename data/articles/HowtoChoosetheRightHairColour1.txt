 Are you just looking for a slight change to revitalize your look or are you interested in making a dramatic change? Make sure that you consider rules at your place of work or school as you plan your new hair color look.;
, Cut pictures out of magazines or save images onto your phone or computer so that you can easily look through the hair color looks that you like. Saving these pictures will also provide your hair stylist with a guide if you decide to have your hair professionally colored.
 If you are considering a haircut in addition to your new hair color, you should get your hair cut first. If you cut your hair first, you will save money because you will need less dye to color your hair. Cutting before coloring will also allow you to see the effects of your new hair color on your new haircut.
 If you make a dramatic change, like going from blond to black, then you will need to have regular touch-ups to maintain that look. But if you only make a subtle change, like going only one shade darker than your natural color, you will not need to worry about maintenance as much. Decide how much time and money you are willing to put into maintaining your hair color before you decide on a hair color look.

 Children model much of their behavior after that of the adults around them. If you want your children to be grateful, you will need to express gratitude regularly. Say “thank you” and show your appreciation for others through small gifts, kind words, and loving actions. These things will create an atmosphere of gratitude that will nurture your child’s gratefulness.If you regularly express disappointment or are unsatisfied with the things that others do for you, do not be surprised if your children develop similar habits.
 Children often pursue materialistic goals at the expense of connecting with others or engaging in personal growth. Instead of facilitating a child’s already strong inclination towards materialistic goals, encourage values that build community and help them better understand themselves. As your child develops these intrinsic goals, they will learn to appreciate the things that others have done for them.Foster your child’s intrinsic goals by giving experiential gifts instead of material ones. Instead of toys, take your child on a camping trip or buying them a membership to the local museum.
 By inspiring your children to help others, you are helping them build strong personal relationships with people in their community. They also develop a greater appreciation of the ways in which others help them. With your children, volunteer in your community or donate to local charity groups. These actions will help your children appreciate what they have while being thoughtful of others., Developing a mindfulness practice is a great way to foster gratitude in your child. Being mindful will help you appreciate your connection with your child and other people. Spend time with your child and develop a family mindfulness practice. Help your children develop an appreciation of the world through daily gratitudes, meditation, and anxiety reduction.It is important that you develop a mindfulness practice before you teach it to your children.

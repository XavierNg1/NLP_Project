Dealing with a bipolar husband can be difficult, so give your time to adjust to the new challenge in your life.
 Though you may have to make adjustments and sacrifices because your husband has bipolar, that does not mean that your life should be only about your husband. You should not live for him. You should be your own person, with your own interests and your own life. Pursue hobbies, your career, and personal goals. Don’t sacrifice yourself.Remember that you are a human being who deserves a good life. You deserve to take care of yourself in addition to your husband. Having your life revolve only around your husband can cause a lot of problems for both of you.

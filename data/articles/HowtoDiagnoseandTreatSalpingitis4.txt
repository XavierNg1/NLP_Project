 As a first course of action, your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics to fight the infection. For most women with salpingitis (around 85%), antibiotics alone can successfully eliminate the problem.
 In more severe cases, your doctor may recommend that you enter the hospital. While there, you can receive fluids and antibiotics intravenously (through a needle in your arm).
 Most women are successfully treated with antibiotics, but in some cases, surgery does become necessary. Your doctor will recommend surgery if there are abscesses on your fallopian tubes that must be drained. In a small number of cases, you may also need a salpingectomy â€“ the removal of damaged fallopian tubes.


If your salpingitis is related to a larger case of pelvic inflammatory disease, you may wind up undergoing a complete hysterectomy along with a salpingo-oophorectomy. In such cases, a surgeon will remove your uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.
 If your salpingitis is traced to a sexually transmitted infection like chlamydia or gonorrhea, your recent sexual partners should be tested and treated. Keep in mind that these partners may be infected even if they have no symptoms.

 This random event is located on a dirt road to the west of an Ammu-Nation store and to the east of the Land Act Reservoir. You will see two red dots on your minimap if this event is available.
 Two of them will arrive first (on an ATV and a dirtbike) and will try to stop your vehicle by parking behind and in front of your vehicle. Use Franklin’s special ability to slow down time (which can only be done inside a vehicle), and then shoot at them to do a drive-by. Once you’ve killed them, one more will show up on an ATV, and you will need to kill him as well to complete the event.


If you prefer, you can shoot at them from outside your vehicle. However, doing so will make you more vulnerable to damage unless you take cover. Since they will be surrounding your vehicle, which is the closest place you can take cover, staying in your vehicle is the best option.
Alternatively, you can run over them, but it may take longer to kill them.
Fleeing the scene will end the event, causing it to be incomplete.
 Walking over to their bodies will give you the money and sawed-off shotgun ammo. They will have dropped around $600.

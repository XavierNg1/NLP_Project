 While you may not have been breaking down your muscles during your workout, you have engaged your metabolism, heart muscles, and blood vessels in a way that demands a rejuvenating snack that, yes, still includes some protein.


Carbs are important before your cardio based workout, but keep them out of your post workout (so as to keep your body from storing fat in your cells).
Make sure to include protein. You won't need as much as a body builder, but it is still important in keeping your muscles strong (especially your heart).
Similarly, try to include fatty acids, like Omega 3's found in fish oil.
High fiber is important. Besides keeping you regular, it will help keep you feeling full in place of carbs, and can help fill out your snack.
Get enough salts/acids to replace what you sweat out. A little bit of salt or citrus can go a long way into keeping you from feeling fatigued.
 Remember to keep carbs/sugars low, and protein/fiber high. Be sure to have plenty of water with the snack that you choose.

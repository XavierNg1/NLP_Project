, Select the gentle cycle and turn on the washing machine. You will then need to watch the machine until it hits the rinse cycle. Once the machine hits the rinse cycle, remove the curtain from the washing machine.It will be dripping wet at this point, but thatâ€™s okay as you are going to let it dry over your bathtub.
 Take the dripping shower curtain and gently hang it up over your bathtub using the shower curtain rings. Make sure the bottom of the shower curtain is inside the bathtub, not on the outside, so the dripping water will go into the tub.
 Once you have hung up the shower curtain, let it dry overnight. The weight of the dripping water as well as the exposure to air should flatten out any folds in the curtain.

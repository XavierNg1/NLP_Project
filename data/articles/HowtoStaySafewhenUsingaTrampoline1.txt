 The ideal location for your trampoline is one out in the open, away from any trees or objects that you might hit while jumping. You also should keep the ground clear for several feet around the trampoline.Removing any objects within 8 feet (2.4Â m) of the trampoline in all directions.
The ground under and around the trampoline should be as level as possible to keep people from jumping too high or causing the trampoline itself to flip over.;
, Invest in a trampoline that comes with safety pads, or find safety pads that will fit the trampoline you want right away. Hitting the metal edge of the trampoline frame is one of the easiest ways to get hurt.Without pads, your feet also can get caught between the springs of the trampoline, causing injury. Safety pads prevent this.
It's best if the color of the cover contrasts sharply with the color of the frame. This way you can easily see if the cover has been disturbed., The safety net keeps someone from being bounced off the trampoline onto the ground, or from hitting the metal parts of the frame while they are jumping.Make sure the net is high enough that people will not routinely jump higher than the top of the net. You may need to get a higher net if there will be larger adults using the trampoline who are able to jump higher than children.
Don't extend the net to cover the space under the trampoline. Otherwise you may have difficulty keeping the area under the trampoline clear.
 If you have soft, spongy grass in your backyard, you don't have to worry about lining the ground around the trampoline with anything else. However, you should never place a trampoline on a hard ground surface such as concrete.Look for sand or wood chips. Any material commonly used around playground equipment can also be used around a backyard trampoline.
The purpose of this material is to prevent serious injury if someone should fall off the trampoline onto the ground.

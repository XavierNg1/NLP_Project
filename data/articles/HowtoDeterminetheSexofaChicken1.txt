 Easily enough, often a chick's down color will tell you whether it's male or female. Of course, it depends on the type of chicken you're raising -- if they're Black-Breasted Red, Light Brown, or Silver Duckwing, it'll be simple. The males have only two colors down their backs and a dot on the crown of their head; females have three colors and they all run up and down their backs.


Barred Plymouth Rocks can produce chicks that are easy to sex at hatching (they're black with yellow or white spots). With this breed, the males have yellow spots on their heads. For the New Hampshire or Buff Orpington types, the male chicks will have off-white streaks on their wings while the females will often have brown lines down their backs and/or dark spots on their heads.;
, Female chicks (pullets) get their feathers quite quickly -- in the first week or so. Cockerels' feather growth doesn't go nearly as quickly. However, at 2-3 months you will see the long and pointed hackle feathers developing on the males.


The cockerels will start to develop combs at around 1 1/2 months in most breeds. It will start to redden in the males; the females will still be yellow.
 Cockerels are usually bigger by just a few weeks old. What's more, cockerels (the males) have angular (and often larger) heads, while the pullets have smaller, round ones.


Cockerels usually have longer legs, too (look for spur development).
 Go into your henÂ  house and sneeze. The cockerels will probably stay put and the pullets will scatter! Talk about reinforcing gender norms, huh?, Roosters are brave and put the hens first. They'll find a piece of food and call for the female to eat it. They also crow whilst females obviously lay eggs.

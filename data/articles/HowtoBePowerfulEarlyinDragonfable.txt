 A lot of their levels are scaled so if you are level 10 and below, then it will be easier than you thought. Just keep fighting until you find the boss if you're lucky and finished it you might get a very rare "ChickenCow Armor".;
, Surely you want a cooler weapon and class/armor than your usual armor. Well if you're a guardian you can get a powerful copy of it and you can use it at any level. Or if you're a Dragonlord. It's about the same.

And Option 2 is go to the Bandit hideout and kill the bandits until the boss, the lowest you can get is 50 gold and highest is 600 gold you can also get extra gold by selling the daggers but if your a rouge it is useful as it has about 20 daggers.
 The common place to get them is at Aria's/Grandma's/Cysero's but be wary, the pets at Aria's/Grandma's are cheap but they tend to miss a lot so that renders them useless on the other hand RARE pets and pets for Dragon Amulet holders(DA) is expensive but only because they rarely miss and they tend to have special abilities like poison, stun and etc.

 People who trust each other will be more likely to want to communicate with each other, and be able to tell you anything that is on their mind. Keep in mind that building trust takes time - LOTS of time. This is normal, because trust builds through different situations. You have to be patient with this, since it is going to be the foundation for the future of your relationship.Also keep in mind that trust can be lost very easily. All it takes is one situation where you betrayed that trust (for example, an affair with someone else, or lying about something and getting caught). Be careful not to destroy that trust so easily, and if it is destroyed, you have to start again to build it.;
, Sometimes, people are hesitant to communicate certain ideas, thoughts or emotions with others out of fear that the other person will judge them. This is a major hurdle to overcome, even in the most intimate and serious relationships. You have to show your partner that you are not going to judge them for their opinions, their thoughts, and their emotions. This is easier said than done, but if your partner feels that you will never judge them, they will feel more confident about sharing and communicating with you!

, You have to remember that communication is a two-way street. If you want your partner to have healthy communication habits with you, you have to be willing to share healthy communication habits with your partner as well. This will also give your partner an opportunity to see what your preferences are, and give him/her a fair chance at understanding what healthy communication means to you!

, Whenever you communicate with your partner, do your best to be an honest individual. Even if what you are telling your partner is not what they want to hear, you should be an honest individual who strives to tell the truth, no matter how painful it is. Your partner may feel hurt at first, but they will eventually respect you and will learn to count on your honesty!

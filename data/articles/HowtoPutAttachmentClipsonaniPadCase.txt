, Unfold the locking flap and gingerly slip it from the tight clutches of the case. Go slowly and don’t stretch the case - patience grasshopper! As you remove it, notice the top has two small access slots for the mic/earphone jack and power switch.
 Thread the strap material through the ring and fold as shown.
 Position the ring and strap as shown so that the strap lies on the interior of the case and the ring just protrudes through the access hole. The ring should be just at the access hole without excess strap material protruding. It will stretch slightly with use.
 Note the right side strap is positioned to avoid the hump on the back of the case.
 The iPad makes a good straight edge.
 One at a time, carefully run a bead of cement down the line and press the straps into the cement. Only very little should protrude. Using wax paper from the kitchen, gently press the strap to spread the cement.
 Using a paper cutter, cut about 30 sheets of used office paper 8 ½ by 6 ½ inches (21.5 cm x 16.5 cm) to fit inside the case. With the wax paper still in place, put the paper on top, as shown, and place several large books on top to press the assembly. Leave for at least an hour to dry. (Some suggestions for heavy books: Anything by Edward Tufte, MC Escher or NASA.)

, Now you can carry your iPad around without worrying about setting it down and leaving it somewhere!

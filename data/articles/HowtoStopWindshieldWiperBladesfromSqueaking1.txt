 Lift the wiper blade so it is oriented away from the windshield. Wet a piece of paper towel with a small amount of hot, soapy water or rubbing alcohol. Wipe the blades with the towel until the paper towel comes away clean.

Remember to clean the arm and hinged parts as well. Hinged parts of the wiper assembly can stiffen with dirt and grime, contributing to squeakiness.
For severely dirty wipers, you may need to use several pieces of paper towel. If your paper towel is somewhat flimsy, double it up before wiping or use a rag.
If your wiper blades don't stay in position when pulled away from the windshield, hold the blade away from the glass with your free hand and clean them one at a time.;
, Coat your windshield with a generous amount of ammonia-free glass cleaner. Now you’re ready to wipe the windshield clean with a soft, lint-free cloth, like one made from microfiber. Wipe with a top-to-bottom motion until the glass is clean.


Undiluted white vinegar can be substituted for glass cleaner. Add it to a spray bottle and use it as you would glass cleaner. Avoid getting vinegar on painted areas of your car.Ammonia based cleaners can damage tinting and cause plastic to degrade quickly. Ammonia-free glass cleaners should be clearly indicated on their label., Simply sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda on a water dampened paper towel for a stronger cleaning. Then wipe the glass clean in a top-to-bottom motion., If squeaking starts suddenly when you’re on the road, you won’t have the luxury of having household supplies on hand. Instead, keep some alcohol wipes in your car. When squeaking occurs, wipe the rubber of both blades with the alcohol wipe.

 Mix enough baking soda and water together to form a paste a little bit thicker than toothpaste.This will require slightly more baking soda than water. Once the paste is mixed, apply to rusted material and begin working in with an abrasive, such as steel wool or a toothbrush. Wipe off and inspect the site.


You may need to use several applications of your baking soda paste in order to see results, but the process definitely works.
 Achieve the same consistency as the baking soda paste by using slightly more cream of tartar than hydrogen peroxide. Apply to rusted material, work in with an abrasive, and then wipe off.


If you do not have hydrogen peroxide, you can also use water to similar effect. The active rust-busting ingredient here is cream of tartar.

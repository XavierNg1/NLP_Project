 The 80s was all about big hair - the taller, the wider and the crazier, the better. If you really want to commit, ask for an 80s style perm at your local hair salon, otherwise you can just aim for tons of volume through blow drying, teasing and lots and lots of hairspray!

, Massive earring are an 80s fashion must-have for both guys and girls - and it really is a case of "the bigger the better". Look for feathers, over-size crosses and enormous hoops that reach as far as your shoulders.
 Fingerless gloves hit the big-time in the 80s, mainly thanks to Madonna and her quirky, punk-rock fashion. Lace and leather are two popular materials, but really anything goes. You don't even need to worry about finding fingerless gloves in the store -- just cut the fingers off regular gloves for perfect 80s grunge., Wooly, neon-colored leg warmers are pretty much synonymous with the 1980s and the cast of Fame. Pair your legwarmers with some funky 80s style workout gear or your favorite heels and mini-skirt!

, Most 80s ladies did not go in for "the natural look" when it came to make-up. Women literally painted their faces with heavy pink blusher and bright blue and green eye shadows all the way to the eyebrows. Combine with lashings of blue mascara and eyeliner and your eyes are good to go. Next get some frosty pink lipgloss or blue/red lipstick and you'll look like you stepped straight out of the 80s!

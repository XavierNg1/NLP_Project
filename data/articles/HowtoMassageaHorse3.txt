 There are many telltale symptoms of muscle pain in horses. These physical signs include flinching away when you attempt to saddle them, traveling with their head elevated, or trailing their hind end instead of stepping under themselves.These symptoms usually indicate that your horse has some muscle pain and would benefit from a massage.
 A clear sign that your horse is in need of a massage is when they seem to be performing at a lower level than normal. This can include things like resisting lateral work, cantering less often than usual, or a decrease in coordination.


When humans experience a stiff back or sore muscles, they have trouble performing their daily tasks in the same way. Horses are no different.
 If a horse is in pain, they will usually act differently. Watch for signs in their behavior like resisting being saddled, decreased interest in treats, or lessened interest in activities they normally enjoy.If your horse seems depressed or less interested in things than usual, you should check with a vet to make sure they arenâ€™t sick. But also consider that they might need a massage.
 If you are having trouble giving your horse a massage, you could consider looking into hiring a professional horse masseuse or being trained by one yourself. There are plenty of workshops hosted by professionals in the field to help you get the training you want.These kinds of training seminars are great if you have a horse that is resistant to your basic massage techniques or who seems to flinch away in pain when you attempt to massage it.

 This is like a normal gedan barai with both arms slanting downwards to the sides of your body, almost like you're pretending to be an aeroplane. It's done so you can do the kick without losing balance and falling over.


Make sure your stance is low.;
, Try to make your heel and toes spring up in a simultaneous motion.


Keep your leg bent and toes pointed forward. Do not let your toes point towards the floor.
Ensure your toes are together. Be careful not to let one toe separate from the others; to prevent a broken toe.
This move, lifting the leg, is the most important of any to make the kick powerful. Practice, to make sure it is fast.
To refine the leg life, you can imagine you will be striking someone with your knee. The lift of the leg should be that strong and fast.
 Point the ball of your foot at the spot you want to aim at. This is the "Striking surface" and will do a lot of damage if it hits.



Rolling the hips forward gives kick extra power and speed.
Ensure your toes are pulled back prior to impact. You want to hit with the ball of the foot, not the toes.
Exhale and/or kiai on impact for maximum force.



You should feel a snapping motion. The kick makes a solid contact and then snaps back.
Snap back needs to be all the way back to the position in Step 2. Do not drop your foot straight down. Control your leg all the way back.
The impact/snap back can be a bit tricky to get if you are kicking the air. Some of your practice should involve kicking a makiwara or other target so you can get the feeling of impact/snap back.
Snap back is important for several reasons. It makes the kick more effective, prepares you for the next technique, and ensures your opponent does not grab your leg.



Don't wobble.
Keep your "Zanshin." This means, keep your eye on your (real or imagined) opponent, keeping ready for the next technique.
 It is important to have ability to mae geri with either leg.

 As long as the ground isn't bone dry, you can prop the nose of the ball in a small divot and use it as a makeshift tee. To do so, simply kick your heel into the ground, aiming with the point where the back of the shoe meets the bottom. You want to be facing the direction you're kicking when you make the divot. Then ease the nose of the ball into the ground.


If you normally kick with a tee, you'll need to take a few practice hits to get used to the new ball placement. It is slightly lower than a tee, meaning you need to get your foot a little further under the ball to get it up.
 You want one of the round, low cones. While a little bit higher than a standard tee, you can balance the ball easily on the hole in the tip and use it to elevate the ball for a perfect kick.
 While it is not the most elegant solution, a high school team in the United States once used the opening in the top of a cleat to prop the ball up, allowing the kicker to make full contact with the ball.

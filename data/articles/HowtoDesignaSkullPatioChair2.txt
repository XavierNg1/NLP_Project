 Light plastic chairs will move around when you are cutting so securing the chair is vital to making this a success.

Weigh down the legs with bricks or rocks if your chairs have feet. You can also push the chair up against the wall to make sure it doesn’t tip over.






Weigh down the chair seat to keep the chair in place. If your chair doesn’t have feet you can also keep the chair in place by placing weight on the seat.
 Any time your work with power tools you should make safety a priority. This includes wearing work gloves and keeping children and pets clear of the area.
 One way you could approach this project is to create the same number of patterns as you have chairs and cut right through them instead of tracing or transferring.


Use heavy duty tape to adhere the pattern to the chair. The pressure from the handsaw could move the paper so it’s important you secure it.
 While the pattern or design may be ultra cool, you want to make sure the chair is still functional. Consider how you will sit down in the chair after the design has been cut to ensure either the chair won’t break or be unusable.
 Depending on the size of your design and chair you should size up what you will be cutting to match up the right blade.


Make sure your hand saw equipment is up to par. You don’t want to approach this project with a dull blade so make sure you are working with a sharp blade and a hand saw that works well.






Select a slow cutting speed. You may be excited about creating the design but a fast speed could make you more prone to errors.
 Make sure you’ve fully punctured the plastic and you won’t be tearing or twisting the plastic chair to remove the cut out pieces.


Sand the cut out area if you see rough spots. Be careful when using sandpaper as you don't want to scratch the chair.

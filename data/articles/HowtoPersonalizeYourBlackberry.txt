 Many BlackBerry users enjoy installing a theme onto their mobile device. Check the BlackBerry App World or sites like http://crackberry.com/ and for cool, unique themes. Pick one that is visually appealing and includes something you love (your favorite color, a cartoon character you like, etc.).;
, Another accessory that is popular are cases. Not only do cases protect your BlackBerry from scratches, but they also are fun ways to decorate your phone. They come in all types of colors, textures, and images, and everyone is sure to find one that suits them.
 The first thing you see after you unlock your BlackBerry is your background picture, also know as your wallpaper. Your wallpaper can be anything from a photo of your family to a beautiful beach landscape. You can find some wallpaper images that were already preloaded onto your phone. Go to your photos and then the file that is named "Preloaded Pictures". You can also take a picture on the camera on your BlackBerry, and set it as your wallpaper image.

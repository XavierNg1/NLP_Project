 Chances are you’re not the only one who feels wronged. This could come in handy when looking for ways to get even.


Maybe your coworker has wronged several of you. Work with others to formulate a plan.
Grab your friends for a multi-front getting even scheme. You can all use social media to your advantage, or if you have access to your target's apartment or home, enough of you can easily rearrange his furniture, and if you really want to get even, you can do something like putting his mattress on the roof.
 Just like every great heist flick, or mafia movie, everyone has a role. Figure out who is going to distract your target, who’s going to be the lookout, who’s going to be the greaseman, etc. Getting even requires precision when there are many moving parts so make sure everyone knows his role.
 You wouldn’t play in the Superbowl without practicing, so don’t get even without some rehearsal.
 Now that everyone has been assigned a role, it’s time to put your plan into action.


If you’re getting even with your coworker, know how long it will take you to complete your task. Have you and your compatriots get to work early to clock how much time you have.
If you’re getting even with your friend, know what his schedule is like and how long it will take you to get in and get out. If you need his phone or computer pay attention to how he uses it and if he leaves it unlocked. Alternatively, if he has a passcode on his phone, one simple option here is to have your other friend distract your target while you put in the wrong passcode enough times to lock him out. You can even lock him out for 24 hours if you’re feeling especially vindictive.
 You did it! You and your friends got even, now relish in your achievements with a beverage or two.

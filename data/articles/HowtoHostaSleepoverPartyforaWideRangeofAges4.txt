, Before your guests arrive, cut out cards that are all the same size (one for each guest e.g. if there are 5 people coming make 5 cards) write murderer on one and detective on another and suspect on the rest. If there are children coming who can't read/are not confident readers draw a shape beside each one and for example say - if you have a square on your card you are the murderer. Everyone keeps their card a secret. The lights go out and if you are the murderer you have to tap people and they have to scream and fall over however if you are the detective and you get tapped you have to put the lights on and try and guess you the murderer is. If they guess right they win but if they don't the murderer wins.,, There are loads of great apps that can help you with that and they are a great way to remember your sleepover.,, Indoor or outdoor dens/forts are great fun to make and fun to hide out in. They are also great because allÂ kids from 7 to 12 mostly like making dens so its something everyone can join in with.,

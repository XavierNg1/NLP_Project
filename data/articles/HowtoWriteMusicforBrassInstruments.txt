 To write music for brass, you must first have a basic knowledge of music theory, including scalar method, chord analysis, rhythms, and transposition.;

Horns and mellophones are usually in the key of F, and rarely in Bb. In Europe, Eb (Alto) Horns are found in some bands. Mellophones may also be pitched in G in drum and bugle corps.
Trombones are usually in C and written in the bass clef, or rarely, in tenor clef. In British brass bands they are in Bb treble clef.
Baritones are in C if you read it in the Bass Clef, or Bb if you read it in the Treble Clef. Bugle corps may also use marching euphoniums written in G treble clef. Remember to always provide a part for both clefs.
Tubas are usually written in C in bass clef, though in British brass bands, tubas may be written in Bb or Eb in treble clef, depending on the size of the tuba. Contrabass bugles, the tubas' equivalent in bugle corps, are pitched in G.
 Depending on what type of song you want, you should choose between major or minor. Major is the norm for music writing, but minor is also used. Songs in minor sound much more solemn, and give opportunity for expression. Next, choose your meter, and instrumentation.
 Start on the tonic (First note of the scale) and try to end up on the tonic, or dominant (Fifth note in the scalar note progression). It's best to just sit in front of your piano and play anything that comes to mind.
 Make sure any dissonance fits in context, and does not detract from the overall performance.
 Then beef up the chord progression, so the poor tuba players aren't holding whole notes for the entirety of the piece.

 Because fish are cold-blooded, they are usually less active during the winter months than in summer and therefore do not put up as much of a fight as in warmer weather, so it usually isn't necessary to use heavy lines when ice fishing. A spinning or spincast reel with a good quality gear system and drag will work well when ice fishing.


You may need to use a thinner reel lubricant for ice fishing than for warm water fishing, as thicker lubricants tend to gel in colder weather. (This is the same reason you use a thinner or multi-viscosity oil in your car during the winter.)

, Lines of 2 to 6 pound test (1 to 3 kg class) are usually the best choice for ice fishing. Most ice fishermen spool their reels regular nylon monofilament line, although some favor lines specially designed for ice fishing.

 There are many possible choices because a number of different forms of the Japanese maple have been cultivated over the last few centuries. The Japanese maple is broken into various cultivar groups to help you choose:

Palmatum group: This species has hand-like leaves with five to seven lobes.

Dissectum group: This species has deep, finely serrated edges to the leaves. Each leaf has five to nine lobes.

Linearilobum group: This group has a long and slender lobe with five to seven lobed leaves.

Most Japanese maples will grow to around 5 meters (16.4 ft) in height and end up with a broad, vase-like crown. The main trunk is usually about 1 meter (3.3 ft) in height and strong.;
, There may be specific needs that apply to your particular cultivar that should be followed.
 The soil space should be deep to allow the roots to take hold easily. If you're potting the Japanese maple, ensure that the container is of a decent size, use high quality potting mix and prefer a potting mix containing water crystals.
 A reasonable amount of daily sun is required but Japanese maples don't like hot afternoon sun. Provide adequate afternoon sun shading.
 Wind can damage or dry the tree, so find a sheltered position for it.
 A good layer of mulching will help to keep the moisture in.
 Use a good fertiliser to keep the plant well nourished. Slow-release fertiliser is a good choice for summer time.

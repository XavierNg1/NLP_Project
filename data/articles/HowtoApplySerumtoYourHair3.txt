 Don’t start with the front or the top of your hair and ruin your style with too much serum. Instead, use your hands to gently blot the serum into the midsection and tips of your hair- starting at the back and moving forward to the front of your hair. This way, if you apply too much to your hair to start, it won’t be noticeable.
 If you have been very careful not to over apply serum, you may need to add a little more to your hair. If your hair still looks a little dry, apply another drop to your hand, and, again, rub it between your palms well. Apply it now to the sides and front of your hair. The serum should make your hair less frizzy, more flexible and more vibrant.
 After you have blotted your hair with the serum and it has the shine you want, your hair might be due for a last little volume boost. If your hair is a little flat, go back and re-curl/style your hair to re-energize it.
 If after a couple hours or a day your hair serum is leaving your hair greasy and heavy, consider shopping for another hair serum. You may have picked a serum that doesn’t suit your hair type. It is common with hair products that trial and error is necessary before you have success.

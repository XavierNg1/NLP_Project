 This method calculates your total blood volume in milliliters. To perform the calculation, you will need your height in inches and your weight in pounds. The formula is: (0.006012 x Height3{\displaystyle ^{3}})+(14.6 x Weight)+604.If you have your height in centimeters and your weight in kilograms, you will first need to convert them to inches and pounds, respectively. 1 centimeter is 0.39 inches. 1 kilogram is 2.2 pounds.

 Calculate the height function of the formula. Cube your height in inches and then multiply it by 0.006012.

 Calculate the weight function. Multiply your weight in pounds by 14.6.

 Add the height function to the weight function. Add 604.

, This method uses the average number of milliliters of blood per kilogram of body weight that a man has. This method is also called the reference book method.Your weight should be in kilograms. If you need to convert pounds to kilograms, 1 pound is 0.45 kilograms.

 Multiply your body weight in kilograms times the average for men: 75 milliliters of blood per kilogram.This will give you your estimated blood volume in milliliters.
 Not all types of tissue have the same amount of blood in them. This means that if a person is obese or very thin, it will influence the accuracy of the calculations. Gilcherâ€™s Rule of Fives makes adjustments for this in the estimated amount of blood per kilogram of body weight. If you know your weight in pounds, convert it to kilograms by multiplying by 0.45. Then multiply your body weight in kilograms by one of these values to get your estimated total blood volume in milliliters:Muscular men have 75 mL of blood per kilogram of body weight.

 Normal men have 70.

 Thin men have 65.

 Obese men have 60.

 This is the tank that supplies water for your pump. The water level in the tank will also equal the water level in the pipe, so this is the level the pump is currently drawing from.

If you are pumping from a well, either measure the depth directly or look for an estimate of water table levels in your area (at this time of year). Government agencies such as the USGS can often provide this information., The destination reservoir is a second tank, to which the pump transfers water from the base reservoir. Make sure it is empty and connected properly to the pump.

If you do not normally have a tank here, just put down a large bucket to collect the water for this measurement. Use a bucket of known size in gallons.
 Using a scale or ruler, measure the vertical distance between the water level in the base reservoir tank and the water input at the destination tank. Write down the distance in feet.

For example, say the water level in the first tank is 120 feet lower in elevation than the destination reservoir.

For this step, it doesn't matter how much horizontal distance the water travels.
 Turn on the device, and it will start pumping water. Start a stop watch at the same time.
 Once your pump is working, you can measure the volumetric flow rate: the volume of water transported per unit of time. Note this rate in gallons per minute.

For example, your pump takes 30 seconds to fill a 10 gallon container. This means the flow rate is 10 gallons30 seconds∗60secondsminute=20gallonsminute{\displaystyle {\frac {10\ gallons}{30\ seconds}}*60{\frac {seconds}{minute}}=20{\frac {gallons}{minute}}}. This is usually written 20 gpm, for "gallons per minute".
 Specific gravity is a measurement of density: the more dense a fluid is, the more power it takes to pump. Water has a specific gravity of 1. If pumping a different fluid, look it up on a specific gravity engineering table.

This example will use water, so the specific gravity is 1.
 The water horsepower of the pump is roughly equal to H∗Q∗SG3960{\displaystyle {\frac {H*Q*SG}{3960}}}, where H is the vertical distance the water travels in feet, Q is the flow rate in gallons per minute, and SG is the specific gravity of the fluid.

In this example, the pump is operating at 120ft∗20gpm∗13960={\displaystyle {\frac {120ft*20gpm*1}{3960}}=} 0.65 horsepower.

In reality, you are likely using more power than this on your pump. Your pump is also overcoming the force of friction in the pipes, and some power is wasted due to the inefficiency of the motor. You can double this result for a rough estimate of power consumption, or track the actual amount of fuel or electricity your motor uses, or refer to the full calculations above.

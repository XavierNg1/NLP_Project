 In 2012 and 2013, they conducted the “Plumpy’Nut Challenge” to increase awareness of malnutrition. Check the http://www.plumpynut.co.uk/ website frequently for updates.
 They will send you a box of Plumpy’Nut packets. You must agree to only eat Plumpy’Nut for a few days to a week.
 Raise pledges before you start the challenge.
 Submit the pledged donations to Merlin.

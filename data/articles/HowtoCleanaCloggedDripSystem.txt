Try backwashing the filters with the drip system's own water or manually remove and clean them., The bleach's chlorine can reduce calcium carbonate buildup from hard water running through the lines.

Introduce the bleach during the final 30 minutes of an irrigation cycle or however long it takes to fill all the drip lines with water.
Enough bleach should be added so that by the time the irrigation cycle ends, the residual chlorine at the end of the system would be the same amount as found in 2.6 oz. (78 ml) of bleach mixed in 1000 gallons (4000 l) of water.
Use a metering pump to add a food-grade phosphoric acid to the drip lines to keep their water's pH at 7. Injecting acid for a short period of time, then rinsing it through the lines, should not harm the drip system.

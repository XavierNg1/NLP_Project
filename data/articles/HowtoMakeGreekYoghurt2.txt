 Instead of discarding the whey that becomes a by-product of Greek yogurt, find a use for it instead. If you're really intrepid, you can drink it straight up, although it may not taste very appetizing. Here are some ideas you can tweak to make use of your leftover whey:









Freeze it up in an ice cube tray and add it to your smoothies for added nutritional content.If you don't want to hassle with freezing it, you can just add it as-is to your smoothie.
Replace buttermilk, milk, or water with whey in your baking. Have a recipe that requires one of those three? Why not try whey instead? Use whey to bake bread or even pancakes.
 Once you make your own yogurt, you can use the bacteria cultures present in it to serve as the starter for your next batch of yogurt. The third or fourth generation starter, however, might not be as tasty as a first generation starter, so be sure to invest in some new bacteria after the third or fourth batch of yogurt.
 Yogurt is fantastic on its own, especially if it's homemade. You can also use yogurt in a number of great-tasting recipes if you accidentally make a too-big batch and don't know what to do with it. Here are some ideas for you to ponder:









Make a tropical yogurt parfait
Make frozen yogurt cups
Make a sweet lassi
Make blueberry yogurt cookies

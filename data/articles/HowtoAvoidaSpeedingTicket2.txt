 If you get pulled over, present all of the identification requested of you and resist any urges to be antagonistic to the officer involved; do not give them any more reason to want to give you a ticket.Ask for as much information as possible, including where they first saw you and how long they paced you.While this scenario is a stressful one, being agreeable and friendly may get you out of a speeding ticket..


If youâ€™re feeling bold, try asking the officer if they will consider giving you a warning instead of a ticket.
 Paying a speeding ticket right away is essentially an admission of guilt; you generally have 90 days to either enter a plea or pay the fine, so delay paying to explore your options. In many cases, fighting the ticket will not mean going to trial.Take the time to inspect your ticket for any errors in information (e.g. citation number, location of where you were stopped and the time of day you received the ticket)., In addition to being costly, speeding tickets can raise your insurance premiums for several years.Whether or not you're guilty, always contest your ticket; you have the chance of at least reducing the fine. Cases are often thrown out if the officer in question doesn't not show up to court, if they go to court at all.

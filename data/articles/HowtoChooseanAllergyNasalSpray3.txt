 There are many conditions that have the same symptoms as seasonal allergies. These include colds, asthma, sinusitis, and nasal polyps.Before you start a nasal spray, make sure that you are really suffering from allergies. Your doctor can not only diagnose your allergy, but they can also recommend the best spray for your particular symptoms.
 To help you uncover the root of your allergies, you should keep a detailed record of when your symptoms flare up and what you think causes them. Common symptoms for seasonal allergies include itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny or stuffy nose.On your phone, computer, or in a journal mark down:


What time of day do you experience symptoms?
Where are you when you feel the symptoms? Outside? Inside?
What seems to be the trigger? Is it pollen, dust, mold, or pets?

, If your allergies are severe, you may want to ask your doctor for an allergy test. These are typically tests where you are pricked with your suspected allergen. The doctor will note what kind of reaction it causes. Allergy tests can be useful for finding the underlying cause of your allergy so that you can choose proper medication and avoid the allergen in the future.

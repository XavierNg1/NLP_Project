 Because ink tends to be sticky, and can easily spread well beyond the initial area of a spill. Give the entire shirt a good look-over to make sure that you have found all affected areas.
 If necessary, place the entire shirt into a bowl a milk to make sure that all affected areas are covered. Allow it to sit for at least ten minutes, and up to an hour.Milk is one of the mildest potential cleaning agents you can use, and there is not known fabric that can not be treated in this way.
It may be best to use 2 percent or whole milk. While the water in milk will pick up most types of dyes, the fats in whole and 2 percent milk will absorb others.
This form of treatment is really only effective for the freshest of ink marks. Dried stains will not be affected by soaking in milk.
 Rinse out some of the milk and ink in your kitchen or bathroom sink.
 If there are only minor marks indicating where the spill had been, the milk treatment has worked. If the ink is largely unaffected, you may have to try an alternative method.
 As noted above, there is a difference of opinion about the effectiveness of hot versus cold water. Some argue that hot water is most effective.A bare majority says that hot water only sets the ink and results in a stain.Just to play it safe, cold water may be the best washing option.









Wash the shirt by itself. The ink can be transferred from the shirt to other clothes during the washing process.

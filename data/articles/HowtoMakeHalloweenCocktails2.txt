 Place one martini glass in the freezer until it's frosted and cold. You could also fill the martini glass with ice water and let it sit while you mix the cocktail. Pour out the ice water right before filling the martini glass with the cocktail.This cocktail also looks good in any antique or vintage cocktail glass. Just ensure that the glass can hold at least 5 to 6 ounces (150 to 180 ml) of liquid.
 Pour 2 ounces (60 ml) of apple cider, 1 ounce (30 ml) of pomegranate juice, and 2 ounces (60 ml) of tequila into a cocktail shaker.If making just one cocktail at a time, consider using a small cocktail shaker. You could also multiply the recipe to serve a crowd.
 Fill the cocktail shaker with ice and cover it with the lid. Shake the cocktail until the outside of the shaker becomes frosty. Remove the lid and strain the cocktail into your chilled martini glass.Avoid letting the ice sit in the cocktail shaker with the rest of your ingredients. The longer the ice stays in the shaker, the more you risk diluting your cocktail.
 If you'd like to make your poisoned apple cocktail smoke, add a few chips of dry ice. Take care not to handle the dry ice with your bare hands. Wear gloves or use tongs to place the chips right in the cocktail.Keep the dry ice chips small. If the dry ice bits are too large, it will take a long time for them to dissolve and smoke.

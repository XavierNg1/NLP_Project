 You can dye just one carnation, if you want to, but because you will be using so much water and dye for this method, you might as well dye a whole bunch. You will need to dye one carnation at a time, however.
 Fill a large bucket with 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water. Stir in 1 tablespoon (13 grams) of alum and enough food coloring to get the color you want. If you don't have any food coloring, use liquid watercolor or colored ink instead.You can use fabric dye instead. Pour enough dye into 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water until you get the color you want.You can also use a floral dye. Mix it according to the instructions on the package, as each brand may be different., Hold the carnation by the stem, then dip the flower part into the bucket. Swish the carnation around in the water for about two seconds, then lift it out., Hold the flower upside down over the bucket, and let the excess dye drip back into the dye bath. You can give the flower a gentle shake, if you need to., If you think that the flower turned out too dark, you can rinse the excess dye off under clean water.Keep in mind, however, that the color will lighten a little as the flower dries.You can dye more flowers while you wait for the first one to dry.
 Once you have dyed the flower, you can trim its stem, pull off its leaves, etc. You can use it fresh, or you can dry it further to preserve it. Be careful not to get the blossom part wet, however, or the dye may run.

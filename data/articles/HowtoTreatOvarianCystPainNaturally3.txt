 Severe pelvic pain is a sign that the growing ovarian cysts have already caused damage to surrounding structures because of increased compression.


Pain receptors in the area send pain signals to the brain, and you may feel unbearable pain.
This pain is would probably be best characterized as sharp or excruciating.
 Increasing abdominal size is a sign that the ovarian cyst has grown larger.


Use a tape measure to keep track of your abdomen's size and record it everyday. To measure your abdomen, follow these guidelines:
The starting point should be the belly button. Position one end of the tape measure on the belly button.
Wrap around the abdomen horizontally until you reach the belly button again.
Read the measurement and record it in a small notebook.
 If your menstrual flow is greater than 80 ml or more, or you are soaking through a pad or tampon every hour, this is a sign that the growing ovarian cyst has damaged surrounding structures due to the force of compression.


The body gets rid of the excess blood through vaginal bleeding.
Contact your doctor immediately if you suspect that this is the case.
 Persistent high fever can indicate the presence of an infection due to a rupture caused by your ovarian cyst.


An infection can be very serious, so make sure to take your temperature regularly and go to the doctor if you come down with a sustained, high fever.

 The Act allows adult adoptees to request the names and addresses of their birth parent(s) when the birth parent signed a relinquishment or consent for adoption, or had his or her parental rights involuntarily terminated by court order in or after 1984; and the birth parent also signed an Adoptions Information Act Statement (AD 908), available at http://www.cdss.ca.gov/cdssweb/entres/forms/English/AD908.pdf Adoptions Information Act.
 You will need to download Form AD 908 A, available at http://www.cdss.ca.gov/cdssweb/entres/forms/English/AD908A.PDF. You must then fill in some identifying information, including your name, address, and any other names you have used. Your signature must be witnessed by a notary public, CDSS representative, or a licensed adoption agency representative. For this reason, do not sign your form right away.
 Before you sign, take your form to a CDSS representative, a licensed representative of the adoption agency that handled the adoption, or a notary public. A CDSS or adoption agency representative will complete Part B of the form. If you take your form to a notary public, he or she will complete Part D.


If you are able to deliver the form in person to the adoption agency or a CDSS office, you can have your signature witnessed at the same time you submit the form. If you need to mail the form, you should have it notarized instead.
 To turn in your form, send it to the adoption agency which handled the adoption, if known, or to Central Office: Adoptions Support Unit, Department of Social Services, 744 P Street, M.S. 8-12-31, Sacramento, CA 95814. If necessary, CDSS will return your form to you, with the correct address of the proper adoption agency for you to submit your form. Once your consent form reaches the proper agency, the agency will file the form and alert you if and when another party submits a consent form.Private adoption agencies may charge a small fee for this service.

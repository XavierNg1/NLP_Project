 For this technique to work, it’s important to begin at the entrance. Too often, people will try to use this technique only once they’ve gotten lost inside a maze. Trying to do this in the middle of a maze will keep you lost., Always keep your hand along the wall for guidance. Walk ahead, away from the exit, until you reach an intersection or a dead end., With this method, you don’t even have to think your way out of an intersection or back through a dead end. At intersections, you’ll usually be taking the closest path to your right. At a dead end, following the right wall will have you loop around it until you exit the dead end.

As long as you keep your hand on the right wall and walk forward, you will find the exit.

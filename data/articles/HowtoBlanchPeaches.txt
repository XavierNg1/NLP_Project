 Set it to boil.


The stockpot doesn’t have to be very large. You can only fit in as many peaches as will comfortably float at the top—about 4 for most pots.
3-piece stockpot sets with removable colanders work perfectly for blanching. You can remove the fruit without removing the boiling water.;
, Fill a large bowl with cold water. Drop ice cubes into the water.


Set the ice bath near the stove.
, Freestone peaches may be slightly less sweet than clingstone peaches, but they are easier to pull away from the pit.


Clingstone peaches are usually available starting mid-June. Freestone peaches are usually available starting in July.
Store bought peaches are likely to have ripened off the tree, while those at the local farmer’s market were probably tree-ripened. , Blanching is best done with a large batch, since you can blanch many batches of peaches in your pot of boiling water.
 You don’t need to scrub them because you will peel them; however, removing dirt and chemicals will make the boiling water useful for many batches.
 Two intersecting lines that extend deep in the peach will allow for expansion during the blanching process. They will also make the peaches easier to peel. , Stand close by with a slotted spoon.
 The following guidelines are good:


For over-ripe peaches, blanch for 45 seconds.
For ripe peaches, blanch for 1 to 1.5 minutes.
For fairly ripe peaches, blanch for 2 minutes.
For harder peaches, blanch for 3 minutes. , Place them in the ice bath right away.
 They should be slightly warm still, so that they are easier to peel.
 Place a knife just under the peel near your “x” and pull it off. Repeat with each corner of the “x.”

, Remove the pit. Slice them thinly.

 Never take someone’s word that a dog is purebred, even if it looks like a purebred dog. You should research the dog’s ancestors and bloodlines. You can start by looking at the dog’s pedigree.A pedigree is a document that shows the dog's ancestors and bloodlines to prove that it is a purebred.You can order digital or hard copies of your dog’s pedigree from the kennel club they are registered with.
 Another way to ensure that both dogs are purebred before breeding is to do a DNA test. You can start by getting a DNA test from the American or British Kennel Club. However, these tests are only to verify the parentage of the dogs to ensure they are from the proper bloodline.If you want to determine what breed one of the dogs is or if the line has been crossbred, you can order at-home DNA kits to determine the breed. They are available from companies such as Wisdom Panel and DNA My Dog., Only purebred dogs can be registered through the American or British Kennel Clubs. To be registered, the breeders must prove through pedigrees and DNA analysis that the dog is from a line of purebred dogs.By choosing a dog that is registered through one of these organizations, you can be confident the dog has no mixed blood.
 A female who mates with different male dogs around the same time can have puppies in the same litter by different fathers. If your dog has mated with two different breeds, your litter may contain both purebred and crossbred puppies.To ensure this doesn’t happen, either let your female dog only mate with one male dog, or make sure she mates with dogs that are purebred.

 The oxidation state of an ion simply means how many electrons it gains or loses. Most transition metals, which are grouped together in the periodic table of elements, have more than one oxidation state.The oxidation state of an ion is equal to its charge, which is the number of electrons the ion has.
Scandium and zinc are the only two transition metals that do not have more than one oxidation state.
 The most common way to indicate the oxidation state of an ion is to use roman numeral in parentheses to indicate the charge.Continue to use the element name as you would for any positive ion. For example, Fe2+ is called iron (II) ion.
Transition metals do not carry negative charges, so you will not have to worry about adding the -ide suffix., While the roman numeral system is more common today, you may encounter the older naming system, especially on labels. This system adds the suffix -ous to the ion with the lower positive charge, and the suffix -ic to the ion with the higher positive charge.The suffixes -ous and -ic are relative, which means they do not correspond directly to numbers. For example, iron (II) ion would be called ferrous ion using the old system, and iron (III) ion would be called ferric ion, because iron (II) has a lower positive charge than iron (III). Similarly, copper (I) ion would be called cuprous ion and copper (II) ion would be called cupric ion because copper (I) has a lower positive charge than copper (II).
This system does not work well for ions that can have more than two possible charges, which is why the roman numeral system is preferred.

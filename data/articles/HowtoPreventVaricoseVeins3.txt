 Varicose veins don’t usually cause serious health problems. However, they can cause discomfort, pain, and embarrassment. You may want your doctor to help you manage your varicose veins, even if they don’t pose a health hazard. Common symptoms of varicose veins include:


Aches and pain in the legs
Throbbing or cramping
Feelings of heaviness or swelling in the legs
Itchy, irritated, or darkened skin
Fidgety or restless legs

, While most varicose veins do not pose a serious health threat, sometimes they can lead to issues you should seek medical help for. If you have varicose veins and experience any of the following symptoms, see your doctor:Sudden swelling of the leg
Redness or warmth around the vein
Change in skin thickness or color
Bleeding on or around a varicose vein
Tender lump in your leg
Open sores or ulcers

, If your at-home changes do not help your varicose veins, you may want to consider other treatments. Consult with your doctor about your options.Sclerotherapy. This is the most common treatment for varicose veins. Sclerotherapy involves injecting chemicals into the varicose vein, which causes it to swell and then seal shut. After a few weeks, the vein turns into scar tissue and then fades. This procedure can usually be done right in your doctor’s office.

Laser surgery. This is a less common technique, because not all skin types and colors can be treated safely this way. It is also usually not effective for veins larger than 3 millimeters (1/10 of an inch).

Endovenous techniques. These treatments are designed for deeper or severe varicose veins. They are usually done under local anesthesia in your doctor’s office.

Surgery. Surgeries are usually reserved to treat very large or very severe varicose veins. Consult with your doctor to consider whether surgical treatments are right for you.

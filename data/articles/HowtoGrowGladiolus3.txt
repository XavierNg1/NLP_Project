 Make sure you remove the complete corms with all smaller cormels surrounding it. Shake off the loose soil and cut the stems from the corms.
, Break apart the old dried corms off of the new corms and remove loose husks. Leave wrapper husks attached during storage. The new corms are called cormels.
 Cormels will not produce flowers the first year they are planted, but will grow into larger corms for future year's flowers.
 Dust them with the same insecticide you used to protect the plants and keep them in a dark, cool, well-ventilated area where they will not freeze.

 While most softball bats are lightweight and durable, there are differences to consider when choosing a bat material.


Pick an aluminum bat. Aluminum alloys are durable and thin. The light weight aluminum also increases the "sweet spot" of the hitting zone on barrel of the bat, which can help add distance to your hits.
Decide if you want a graphite/titanium lined bat. Graphite and titanium will help reduce vibration. The materials also will reduce the stinging sensation often experienced when the ball doesn't hit the sweet spot of the bat. (If you go to Kmart or any store that sells softball bats you can see that on some bats especially on Easton brand you can see where they marked "extended sweet spot.");

Determine your bat length based on your age. Bat lengths generally come between 24 to 34 inches (61 to 86.4 cm). There are charts available online and at most sporting good stores for players 5 years and older.
Gauge your bat length by your height and weight. Check online for available charts and consult your local sporting good stores to determine the ideal bat for your height and weight.
Evaluate the distance to your wrist. Stand with your arms at your side and your feet together. A bat with the correct length standing on it's end should reach to your wrist.



Choose a bat weighing 29 ounces (822.14 g) or more if you're bigger and stronger than most softball players. You'll receive the benefits of both the heft of the bat and the power of your swing.
Pick a bat weighing 28 ounces (793.79 g) or less if you're a smaller player with less strength. Choosing a lighter bat will enable you to have more control of your swing and swing the bat quicker.
 Every softball league is different, so be sure to obtain a list of approved and/or banned bats before making a purchase.

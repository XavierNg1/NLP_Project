 Unfortunately, dry cleaning solvents aren’t that effective on oil-based stains like ketchup and lipstick. In some cases, they may even make the stain worse. Since the chemicals are so harsh, you may damage your tweed in the process, as well. Use dry cleaning solvents on water-based stains, such as juice or cola stains., These kits can be purchased at most home improvement stores or online. Check the packaging to ensure it’s safe to use on woolen fabrics before you make the purchase. If time allows, you may want to do a quick Google search for customer reviews on various products before purchasing one.
 Some dry cleaning solvents are toxic. Crack a window and complete the process in a well-ventilated area. Restrict children and pets from entering the area while you work.
 Every brand is different, but most dry-cleaning kits provide a stain pre-treatment. This may be a pre-moistened towelette. Follow the instructions provided by the kit to pretreat your item. If there is no pretreatment included, make sure to get up any solid dirt and debris before you begin., Before you begin applying the dry cleaning solution, it’s important to place a cotton pad or thick wad of paper towels underneath the item. This will absorb excess fluid.
 Turn the bottle upside down to dispense the fluid. Then gently rub the stain with a small towel or sponge. The stain should go through the fabric onto the absorbent pad or be absorbed into the towel. Continue applying the solution until the stain is no longer visible on the fabric.
 Some kits will direct you to place the items in the dryer. Proceed with caution, since this can damage tweed. It’s safer to allow the item to dry on a flat surface instead. Let it dry completely before you use it.

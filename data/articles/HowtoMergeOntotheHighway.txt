 This is a very long lane where you rapidly accelerate to get very close to or match interstate speed.;
, Look out for other drivers also entering the highway. If the lane is crowded you won't be able to go too fast until you hit the interstate.
 Usually open highways have a speed limit of 75 mph (121 km/h) so before merging try to be around at least 65 or 70 mph (105 or 113 km/h). On the other hand, highways near winding mountains are only 55–65 mph (89–105 km/h) so your minimal merge speed should be 45 or 55 mph (72 or 89 km/h) respectively.
 Prepare to do the merge there. You must yield to traffic already on the interstate. Look in your mirrors, over your shoulder and always signal.

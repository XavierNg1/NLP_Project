 Buy sections of fence which are high enough for walls and wide enough that each section can make a good single wall. Picket fencing with no gaps works great for this.


You can also build your own.
 Use hinges to join the four or more sections together. Make sure you attach them in the appropriate directions, so that the fence sections can be folded together (picture a Japanese screen). Leave one joint unattached, so that the whole thing can be collapsed.
 Using a jigsaw, cut a square or rectangle in the center section of one or more wall portions (being careful not to cut the brace beams), in order to make windows or doors.


This is somewhat optional, since you can also just move a wall section to get in or out.
 You can paint or stain the wood, as well as add other decorations like a fort flag.
 Fold up the fort and move it into and out of the woods as necessary.

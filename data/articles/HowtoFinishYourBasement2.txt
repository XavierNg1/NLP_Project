 Take out all items that you are storing in your basement. This includes washers and dryers, cabinets, and basically anything else that can move or that takes up floor space. You will need to have total access to all walls and floors while you are working on finishing your basement.
 If you have a concrete floor, you’re going to want it to be as clean as possible before you start. Clean up all dirt and debris from the floor. Mold problems and leakage should be double-checked, just to be sure they won’t cause issues later on.
 This is one part you should really get a pro to do. At best, bad wiring just won’t work. At worst, it starts fires or electrocutes you (and not in a Wile E Coyote kind of way). Unless you want to try your hand at some DIY firefighting, just get a pro to come in and wire your new basement. If you’ve got some experience, however, you can do the bare necessities wiring yourself. Just make sure you carefully plan everything out.
 This is another thing that is good to have a professional do. While it’s less dangerous than bad wiring, it still can lead to costly repairs being necessary later if something leaks. Make sure that you carefully plan ahead so that everything that needs water will be accounted for.
 Insulating is important mostly for soundproofing a finished basement. If you’re going to put a media room down there, you don’t want that sound traveling up and disturbing anyone. Use soundproofing materials to insulate the ceiling and everyone will be happy. Otherwise, building a simple drop ceiling should be enough.
 It will be very important to insulate the basement walls. This will keep your basement warm and cosy, making the space much more livable. There are many types of insulation available but spray-foam insulation is becoming popular for basements.

 A good rule of thumb is to have your burrito at least twice as big as the contents you'll put in it. That means that you have fold the burrito in half, with the contents inside, and easily reach both ends together with room to spare.

, This step is essential. Getting your tortilla warm and moist makes it pliable, meaning that it's easier to work with. To get that warm moisture into your tortilla, try any one of the following:









Place the tortilla under a large panini press on medium setting for 20 to 30 seconds.
Place the tortilla on a plate in the microwave for 30 seconds, using the high setting.
Steam the burrito, using a commercial steamer.
 You probably already have an idea of what you want to put into your burrito, but if not, you can take a cue from these examples:









Beans (black, refried, pinto, etc.)
Rice (white, brown, or "Spanish")
Meat (carnitas, carne asada, chicken, etc.)
Cheese
Lettuce
Salsa ("red," i.e. pico de gallo, or "green," i.e. tomatillo salsa)
Sour cream
Guacamole

, Make sure to keep the contents of the burrito in the tortilla. Set it back down again, open faced.
, Your tortilla flaps probably won't overlap at this point.









Don't pull too hard on the ends of the flaps as you fold them over to the center. This could rip the tortilla, causing the contents to spill out before they spill into your mouth.
, This will bring the burrito together into a cylindrical shape. If you can, let the burrito rest on top of the last little flap for a minute or two; this helps fuse the ends of the tortilla together, making them stick together.
 This does three things: It provides insulation to keep the burrito warm; it helps compact the burrito even more; it gives the person eating the burrito a mold to help keep the burrito together.

 Simple randomization uses a single sequence for random assignments, so an ordinary object is acceptable for use.The only need is to be sure that it has two sides or that it can somehow be distinguished for two separate groups.


Coin
Deck of cards
Dice
Spinner;
, If you are creating groups for a study, for example, you might have a control group and a treatment group. Other uses might be in the classroom, where you are splitting a class into two groups for a game or activity.


Coin—heads to one group, tails to another
Deck of cards—evens to the first group, odds to the second group (note: remove all non-numbered cards, including face cards, aces, and jokers in order to have an even 50/50 split)
Dice—3 and lower to one group, above 3 to the other group
Spinner—left half to the first group, right half to the second group

, This means that you will start using your tool of choice to randomize the whole group into two smaller groups.


Toss the coin for each person or thing in the group.
Pull a card from a shuffled deck of cards for each person or thing. Remember to pull out non-numbered cards, including face cards, aces, and jokers.
Roll the die for each person or thing, assigning him/her/it to whichever group applies based on the number rolled.
Flick the arrow on the spinner and designate each person or thing to a group based on where it lands.
 In many cases, you will need to know who is in each group. It is important to somehow document the groups as you randomize them, and whatever method you choose, you will want to make sure that it can be saved.


Use a tool like a table in a word processing document or a spreadsheet to create the lists.
Write down the names by hand on paper, with two columns representing the groups.
Type the names into each list using a notepad app on your smartphone.

 Comb your hair into a nice high ponytail. Secure it with an elastic hairband.
 Gather about a quarter of the hair below the ponytail.


If you're having trouble separating the hair, you may need to take out the elastic hairband.
 Tie the main/big part of the ponytail with the elastic band. At this point, you should have a segment of hair loosely hanging below the ponytail.
 Take the loose segment of hair and wrap it around the elastic band.


Depending on how long your hair is, you may need to wrap it around the hairband several times.
 Use bobby pins and pin them to the ends of the hair you wrapped. This will secure it and help hold the ponytail in place.
 Look to make sure there are no fly aways or bits of hair sticking out from your ponytail. Make sure the hairband is completely covered by your hair.

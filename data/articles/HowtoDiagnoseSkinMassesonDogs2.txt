 If a mass on your dog’s body is something to be worried about, then it will probably change in size, shape, or appearance quickly. Monitor the lump by checking it once per day or a few times per week. If you notice that a mass on your dog’s body has grown in size, changed shape, or become red and irritated looking, then take your dog to see a veterinarian right away.


Taking photos of the lump and/or measuring it can help you to track any changes with more accuracy than just looking at it. Try snapping a photo of the mass and write down the diameter to help you see if it is changing or growing.

The sooner the skin mass is examined and diagnosed, the quicker your dog can get the treatment she needs.

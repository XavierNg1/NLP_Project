 Try a more complicated design where you overlap the patterns and outlines.
 It will make it easier if you colour the first area then leave the second area empty and again colour the third area. Using this method, continue colouring. If you do not want to colour the first area then leave it untouched and colour the second area. Continue colouring.
 Here is another example of art using overlapped shading to experiment with positive and negative space.

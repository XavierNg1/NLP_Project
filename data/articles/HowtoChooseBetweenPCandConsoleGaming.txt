 An Xbox 360 costs roughly $300, and more for accessories. A PlayStation 3 will cost you the same price. This is obviously a lot cheaper than going out and building an intense gaming rig! If you've got a lot of money, go crazy with a gaming computer. Not so easy to let go of your hard-earned money, and buy yourself a console.;
, Consider what type of games you enjoy. If you enjoy MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft, Aion or Age of Conan, you want a PC. If you want to play RTS games such as League of Legends or Starcraft 2, go for a PC. If you want to play FPS games, I recommend a P.C for tactical shooters, a console if you want to only play Call of Duty. Want to play sports games? Go with a console.
 If all of your friends have a PS3, well, go buy one! But if all of your friends are talking on Steam and enjoying PC gaming, go that route.

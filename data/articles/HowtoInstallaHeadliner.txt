Pry off all the trim that surrounds the headliner and holds it in place.
Detach and remove all of the seatbelt covers, lights, speakers, visors and clothes hangers. You may also have to remove some of the upper A, B, C pillar panels to get the headliner to drop form the roof area. You may have to unscrew some bolts and/or pry some parts up with a flathead or torx screwdriver.
Unclip any clips that are holding the headliner board in place.
Slide the headliner board out of the vehicle and set it on a flat work surface. A large table or the floor will do.
Remove the material from the car headliner board. It should peel off without much effort.;
, Be gentle, so as not to damage the board. The smoother the board surface is, the better your finished headliner replacement will look.
 Spread it out flat and smooth out any folds or wrinkles.
 Working each half of the fabric application separately makes the job easier to manage.
 Brush contact cement on the underside of the headliner fabric and on the exposed half of the headliner board. Alternatively 3M makes a spray adhesive that is much easier to work with.


Get the strongest glue you can. Because of the location of the headliner, many weaker glues will fail with heat.
,, Drying time will be listed on the adhesive label.
 Use a hobby knife for this.
 Leave about 0.5 inch (1.27 cm) of extra fabric around the circumference of the board so that it can be tucked in during installation.



Tuck the excess fabric under for clean edges.
Secure the headliner with the car's headliner clips (if applicable).

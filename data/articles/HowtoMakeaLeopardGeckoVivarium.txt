 Get a 20 gallon (75.7 L) long terrarium or vivarium, but you could do with a 15 gallon (56.8 L). You could also use a Rubbermaid tub but make sure the dimensions are at least 30"x12" and that it is tall enough for no escape. You could get a tank with sliding doors instead, which would make taming easier.;
, Something like an under tank heater of the appropriate size. The heater should take up one third of the cages bottom and be completely to one side not in the middle. You could also use heat tape and it will work just as well. The reason I recommend an under tank heater is because Leos absorb heat from their stomachs.
 What you can use is dry Eco earth or textured tile. Do not recommend sand and do not use wood at all.
 You will need a total of three; one on the side of the heater and one of the other side. Now you will need another hide on the side with the heater and it needs to have moist moss, eco earth, or paper towels in it to aid with shedding.

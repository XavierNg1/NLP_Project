 Outline one of these triangles. You will use it to find the length of one side of the rhombus.

Since the triangles are congruent, it doesn’t matter which one you outline. 


, The two diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so the central angle of your triangle will be 90 degrees. , The hypotenuse is the side opposite a 90 degree angle.Traditionally, the hypotenuse is labeled c{\displaystyle c}.

The hypotenuse of your triangle is one side of the rhombus. So, if you find the length of c{\displaystyle c}, you will know the length of one side of the rhombus.
 Traditionally, these are labeled a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}.
 To do this, divide the length of the diagonal that a{\displaystyle a} runs along by 2. Label the side length on your triangle.

Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other, you know that the length on either side of their intersection will be equal.Since side a{\displaystyle a} is half the length of the diagonal, you can find its length by dividing the diagonal length in half.

For example, if side a{\displaystyle a} runs along a diagonal that is 12 meters long, you can find the length of side a{\displaystyle a} by calculating:a=122{\displaystyle a={\frac {12}{2}}}a=6{\displaystyle a=6} 


, To do this, divide the length of the diagonal that b{\displaystyle b} runs along by 2. Label the side length on your triangle.

For example, if side b{\displaystyle b} runs along a diagonal that is 16 meters long, you can find the length of side b{\displaystyle b} by calculating:b=162{\displaystyle b={\frac {16}{2}}}b=8{\displaystyle b=8}


, The theorem states that a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}. This is a basic geometric formula for finding the side lengths of a right triangle.
 Make sure you substitute for a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}, but the order doesn’t matter due to the commutative property.

For example, if a=6{\displaystyle a=6} and b=8{\displaystyle b=8}, your equation will look like this: 62+82=c2{\displaystyle 6^{2}+8^{2}=c^{2}}.
 To do this, you need to square a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}, add, then find the square root of the sum.

For example:62+82=c2{\displaystyle 6^{2}+8^{2}=c^{2}}36+64=c2{\displaystyle 36+64=c^{2}}100=c2{\displaystyle 100=c^{2}}100=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {100}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}10=c{\displaystyle 10=c}


, Since the hypotenuse is also the side of the rhombus, to find the perimeter of the rhombus, you need to plug the value of c{\displaystyle c} into the formula for the perimeter of a rhombus, which is P=4S{\displaystyle P=4S}, where s{\displaystyle s} equals the length of one side of the rhombus. In this case, it is the same value that we found for c{\displaystyle c}.

For example: P=4S{\displaystyle P=4S}P=4(10){\displaystyle P=4(10)}P=40{\displaystyle P=40}


, Don’t forget to include the correct unit of measurement.

For example, a rhombus that has diagonals measuring 12 and 16 meters long has a perimeter of 40 meters.

 The type of machine really matters in terms of protecting your sleeping bag:


If you choose to wash in a machine, it is recommended that a laundromat machine is probably better due to the larger space available, and look for a machine that does not have an agitator (front loader). This will keep the drawstrings and straps untangled and intact.If you only have an agitator style washing machine, prefer the bath method; the agitator may destroy your sleeping bag.
 Use a gentle, cool cycle in a washing machine.
 Include a rinse cycle.
 Spin on low only, or use the "drip dry" cycle and follow steps outlined under drying.
 Follow the "Drying" steps.

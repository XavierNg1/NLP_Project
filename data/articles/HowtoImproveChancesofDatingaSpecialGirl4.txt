 Fortunately, asking her out is simpler than pursuing the answer of whether she likes you or not. Once you've received her response (yes, she likes you), proceed to ask, "Would you like to go out with me?"


If the answer is yes, plan out a time and date when both you and her will be available. Be sure it's a place where you both will be comfortable. Make sure you take her home before curfew!
If the answer is no, she still likes you, but she probably isn't ready for this step. It's fine - just tell her you can and will wait. She may accept another invitation from you in the future, but as for now, remain as her friend - the only difference is that you know you two like each other!

, Group dates are less intimidating and are free of stress. Not only will you be building a closer, more intimate relationship with your crush, but you will also be strengthening other important relationships as well! It's recommended that you go on a few group dates together before starting to go on one-on-one dates.


Group dates don't have to be special people. They can just be your original small group or a few friends of hers and yours. However, be sure there is no rivalry between one of your friends and hers, or there may be problems! Be sure everyone is comfortable with everyone.

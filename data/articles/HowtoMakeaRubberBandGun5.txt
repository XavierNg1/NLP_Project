 You'll need a board that is at least one foot (30 cm) long, six inches long (15 cm), and of decent thickness. Thicker wood will result in a sturdier gun. Wood can be bought at most local hardware stores or lumber yards., The wooden board that you now have will eventually turn into the stock and barrel of your rubber band machine gun. But to transform that wood into your legendary rapid-shooter, you'll need:

Pencil (or felt tipped marker)
Saw
Knife
Rubber bands
String
Thumbtack

, Use a pencil or felt tip marker and sketch the outline of your machine gun. You may want to look up some images on line to serve as an example for your outline., Using a normal wood saw, cut along the outline you have drawn on your wood until your machine gun is free from the board. Once it is free, you can take sand paper and rub it against the edges of your wooden gun until it is smooth to the touch., Cut a notch with your knife that runs down the barrel of your wooden gun, starting where your barrel meets the stock and running along the top side. This will be the track for your pull-release string.
 Leave about one inch (2.5 cm) between your horizontal notches, and make sure your tip to tip notch running along the top of your barrel crosses all of your horizontal notches.
 Use a tack to pin your string to the very front of the barrel of your wooden gun. Lay your pull-release string atop the barrel of your gun, guiding it with your fingers so that it lays in the tip to tip track.
 Each of the horizontal notches you cut into your barrel will be a catch on which you can string your rubber band. Take one end of your rubber band and catch it on the front of your wooden gun, and pull it back until you can hook it in place onto a horizontal notch.
 By pulling on the release string quickly, you'll knock the rubber bands free one after another, creating a rapid fire, machine-gun effect. You might also think of pulling the string slowly to create a more sustained effect.

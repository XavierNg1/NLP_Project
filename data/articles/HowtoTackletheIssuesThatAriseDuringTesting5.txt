 The success of any testing effort depends upon the camaraderie between the testers and the developers. They should work as a team so that the expected results are obtained. If there is lack of communication between the two teams then it would severely affect the project schedule.
 The solution for this is that the testers should be kept informed about the build to be tested so that time is not wasted on wrong builds and also on defects that have been already fixed. The development team, on the other hand, should be informed about the defects that have been found so that it can be fixed immediately.

 You can get store-bought kits for $20 to $50 at your drugstore or supermarket. Store-bought kits contain one-size-fits-all trays that you adjust to mold to your teeth.


Kits from your dentist's office may cost about $300. Your dentist will create trays that are created from custom molds of your teeth so the whitening gel spreads equally on the entire tooth surface.
 Check to see that your trays are free of moisture.
 Excess gel in the tray may squeeze out into your mouth and irritate your stomach if you swallow it, or can irritate your gums.
 If gel squishes out onto your gums, wipe it off with a paper towel.
 The length of time you wear the trays will depend on which type of gel you use. There are some tips and tricks you can use with each gel to enhance their whitening abilities.


For carbamide peroxide gel:

10, 15 or 16 percent gel can be worn for two to four hours, twice per day. If you experience no sensitivity, you can wear it overnight.
If you are using 10 percent carbamide peroxide gel, replace the gel after one hour of use and then continue wearing for the remaining time. This may speed up the process, but remember it can only be done with the 10 percent preparation.
20 to 22 percent gel can be worn 30 minutes to one hour, twice per day. Avoid wearing a strong carbamide peroxide gel overnight.


For hydrogen peroxide gel: use the trays for 30 minutes to one hour, twice per day.

Hydrogen peroxide is sensitive to any source of intense light, and causing it to become more active. You can buy a home whitening lamp from the internet for just $10.
 If you're having some problems with sensitivity, use toothpaste that is specially designed for sensitive teeth or use a sensitivity gel.
 Store the trays in their holders so that they can air dry. Then, store your remaining gel in a cool, dry place.
 You'll see your teeth start to look whiter in 1 to 2 weeks.

 This method should be used with long, narrow heads of cabbage. The most common type would be napa cabbage.









Note that there are some similarities between this method and the standard method used for cutting round cabbages, but there are a few small difference, as well.
 Use a sharp knife to cut the cabbage head from top to bottom, cutting straight through the core end.









You will end up cutting the core and stem in half during this step.
Note that you do not need to trim the stem before cutting the cabbage in half.
Hold the cabbage steady with your non-dominant hand and cut with your dominant hand.
Cut carefully so that you do not accidentally slip and cut yourself while working with the cabbage.
Stabilize the cutting board by placing a dry dish towel underneath. This may not be necessary if you have a non-slip cutting mat, however.
 Keep the cut sides facing up. The core should be fairly easy to spot. Make an angled slice around each side of the core. Cut straight through to the bottom so that you can lift the core out afterward.









At this point, you should also peel off any wilted outer leaves.
Rinse the cabbage under cool, running water to clean it, as well.
 From this point on, the cabbage can be shredded, cut into smaller wedges, separated into layers, or used in a variety of other ways for a wide range of hot and cold recipes.

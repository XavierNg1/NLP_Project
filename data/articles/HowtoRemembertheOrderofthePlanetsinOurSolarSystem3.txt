 Memory pegs are things that information hooks onto inside your brain. Use this method to associate images with the things you need to memorize.Each number will be given a word that represents an object.


For example, 1 will be given “bun,” 2 will be given “shoe,” 3 will be given “tree,” and so on.
This method is particularly useful for a visual learner.
 For each of the words assigned to each number, imagine that object. Imagine a shoe for the number 2. Have a clear image in your mind and always think of the same type of shoe for this number.
 Give each planet a number in the order that they need to be memorized. Mercury will be 1, Venus will be 2, Earth will be 3, and so on.
 Connect your number image (1-bun, 2-shoe, etc.) with your planet name. For example, connect Mercury and bun (1) by imagining a hamburger bun with a thermometer sticking out of it., Go through each image set and link the images together. Go systematically, reviewing them one by one. Give yourself a written test to see how well you remember the image sets. Continue to work on linking the images together.

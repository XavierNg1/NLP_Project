 The mode is just one measure of central tendency. It tells you which value appears in the data set most frequently. The mode is helpful because you can use it with non-numerical data. If no value repeats in the data set, then the data has no mode.

If multiple values appear in the set with the same frequency, then it is possible to have more than one mode.
 Make sure to arrange all the numbers in the series, including 0.

For numbers that appear in the series more than once, make sure that when you reorder, you include each instance of that number. 

If you are working with a large data set, it might be helpful to use a spreadsheet program, like Microsoft Excel, to sort your values. Read Sort a List in Microsoft Excel for more information on how to do this. 

For example, if your series is...−1,2,3,1,0,3,10{\displaystyle -1,2,3,1,0,3,10}...you would rearrange them in the following order:−1,0,1,2,3,3,10{\displaystyle -1,0,1,2,3,3,10}.
 This number will be your mode. Remember, it is possible to have more than one mode, or no modes at all.

For example, in the series −1,0,1,2,3,3,10{\displaystyle -1,0,1,2,3,3,10}, 3 is the only number that appears more than once, so 3 is the mode.

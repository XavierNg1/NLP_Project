Make sure you are as comfortable as possible, and wearing comfortable clothes (pajamas are recommended);
, Try to not fall asleep, however. The goal here is you're allowing your body to fall asleep while your mind is still awake. Breathe softly, in and out. This will help you relax more.


Focus on your breathing, and don't get carried away with thoughts.
 Vibrations are totally normal during astral projection and are a sign that you are on the right path. Avoid getting too excited though, as this will only ruin your astral projection. Just stay calm and positive, and relaxed.
 Don't overdo this and don't think too hard.
 This is a great sign that it is working.

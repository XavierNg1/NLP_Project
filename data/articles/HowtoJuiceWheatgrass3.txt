 If you prefer a stronger, more concentrated taste, stick with only 2 cups (500 milliliters) of filtered water. If you are unaccustomed to the taste of wheatgrass, however, or if you find it overpowering, dilute the juice more by using 3 cups (750 milliliters) of water instead. If you like, you can substitute the water with fresh-squeezed orange juice or coconut juice instead. This can give the wheatgrass shot you'll be preparing a bit more flavor.
 Blending for about 60 seconds should suffice. You should be left with an emerald green juice with chunks of pulp floating at the surface.


Note that the grass may get tangled around the blades of the blender if the blades of grass are too long. This will not be an issue in most cases, and you can simply clean the blades of your blender after you finish getting the juice out. Pay attention to possible signs of trouble, though, like a slowing blade or the sounds of a struggling motor. If you suspect that the wheatgrass is clogging your blender, you may need to fish out the wayward wheatgrass before you continue blending.
 The strainer should have fine gaps, and it should be no larger than the mouth of the bowl you place it over.
 The cheesecloth should be large enough to hang over the sides of your strainer.
 Most of the liquid should flow through without much effort on your part.
 This juice should also flow through the cheesecloth and into the container. Continue pressing down on the wheatgrass until no more juice comes out.
 The lemon is only optional, but it enhances the flavor of the wheatgrass while preserving the juice a little longer. Mix with a spatula or spoon to combine. This can be especially useful if you stick to water instead of using juice for your blended mix.
 Serve it chilled or with ice. Wheatgrass can be best enjoyed in shot form.

 Being in love with a person who you’ll never meet is a good learning experience and has the potential to meet many of your emotional needs. However, it also uses up so many of your emotional, financial, and time resources. Choose to reallocate those resources to dating locally. Because you’ll be able to meet people locally, your resources will be much better invested.Go on a local dating website
Or look at a national website, but select your geographic area
Or look to local hobby groups
Ask a friend to set you up with someone
Join a local recreational sports league

, You may feel an internal conflict when you decide to end your relationship to pursue dating locally. Choosing to date locally can be intimidating, especially if you’re in love with someone who you’ll never meet. You have an emotional and intellectual connection with that person, but seek a physical connection as well. Recognize that you feel conflicted, accept that it’s okay, and give yourself permission to seek happiness in a local relationship.It’s good and healthy to admit that you’ll never meet this person for whom you have feelings. Maintaining even the slightest hope that you’ll meet them may only intensify your inner conflict.
 Ending a love relationship can be painful, and it’s not something that you want to feel again intentionally. Refrain from starting another relationship with someone else that you won’t meet. If necessary, stop using the Internet for a while to prevent opportunities for falling into a similarly difficult relationship.Find new games to play, new message boards with which to interact, and new groups to join.
You learned from previous experience that it was important to meet the person who you love, so you want to avoid starting a similar relationship with someone in these new groups or communities.

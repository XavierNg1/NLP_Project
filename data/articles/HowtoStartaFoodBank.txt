 The amount of donations you get may vary throughout the year, so find a place large enough to accommodate the intake. If you are an individual operation, you may be able to start by storing things in your basement or garage.;
, Working with churches, schools, and local government agencies is a great place to start.
 Some banks may have food surpluses that you may be able to purchase. Some food banks do require you to pay for food while others do not.
 Some food banks may only disperse donations every 2 weeks. You may also be able to work with these other agencies to offer your donations on the opposite weeks to help a larger portion of the community.
 You may do this by holding food drives through schools and churches or by setting up a drop-off site outside the local grocery store or other business. Make sure you have permission from the business owner first before you do anything. Grocers may also be willing to donate items that are reaching the expiration dates.
 Have shelving set up in your bank area to separate the items according to product type (cans, boxes, breakfast items, fresh food, dried goods etc). Double check expiration dates and throw out any that are past the freshness date or foods that look suspicious.
 Try to have a variety in each box. If you are packaging for individuals, keep in mind the amount of people the food has to feed and pack accordingly.
 These records can help you better assess what to prepare for them.
 Food donations can decrease during certain times of the year, especially around the holidays when they are needed the most. By getting additional funding, you will be able to fight hunger on a more consistent basis. Reach out to local community groups for monetary funding or check for government funding programs.

Use word of mouth to get cell phone numbers. For example, if you need to find Dave, but don't know his phone number, ask mutual friends if they will get a message to Dave and say that you'd like to contact him. If they don't know where Dave is, either, broaden the search to check with coworkers and family.
Be sure to be honest with these contacts regarding your reason behind obtaining the number to ensure the best results for all parties involved.

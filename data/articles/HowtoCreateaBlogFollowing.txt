 Here are some options that you can provide.


Blog Bookmark: create a button that lets readers bookmark your blog on their Internet browser so they can conveniently access it and not forget about it later on.
Email subscription: ask readers if they want to submit their email address to receive email newsletters or updates related to your blog.
RSS feed subscription: when someone subscribes to your RSS feed they will receive notifications whenever you add a new blog post.;
, Choose a topic that you specialize in or at least you are familiar with so you can write about it with a knowledgeable tone. The topic should be something that can retain your readership for a long time rather than just being a time-sensitive subject that people will lose interest in later on.
 For example, you can create a blog following by offering a free ebook to encourage people to subscribe to your blog.
 This will make followers of other blogs come to your blog and start following it.
 If people don't have time to read your blog right away they may still decide to subscribe to it when they see your advertisement so they can read it later on.
 This will intrigue people to find out more about you and become blog followers. Mention your blog as much as you can. You could discuss it in social gatherings, at your workplace or in online chatrooms. The more people know about your blog the more they will want to follow it.
 People like to discuss information rather than just read a one-sided story. Encourage everyone from your most loyal blog subscribers to new readers to leave comments under blog posts or email you to share their opinions.

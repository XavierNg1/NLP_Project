 In a personal statement, this section will be a little bit different, and will focus more on your personal views on diversity.


Instead of talking about customers or employees in general, talk about how you have encouraged diversity in the past or worked easily with a diverse group of people.
Use your experiences to back up what you’re saying.
 Nothing drives a point home like a personal anecdote. Use a story from your past to illustrate how committed you are to diversity.


For instance, maybe you started a gay-straight alliance when you were in high school because you saw gay friends being bullied.
 Take some time to talk about what types of diversity you are committed to, just as in the organizational statement.


Do you oppose ageism, sexism, classism, and homophobia?
Spell out in your diversity statement in positive statements, such as: “I believe that all people should be treated equally no matter what sex they are…”

, Show how you would use your experiences to embrace diversity in the future at the college or company.


Essentially, you want to convince your employer that you are committed to embracing all people.
If you are applying for a teaching position, you can discuss how you would go about teaching diversity in the classroom.
What types of lesson plans would you use to implement your positions?

 Mascara covers your lashes, which can cause irritation. Removing mascara daily may be harsh on your lashes, and may even cause you to pull them out. Skip wearing mascara for a few weeks. This gives your lashes time to breathe and repair themselves.This includes going without fake eyelashes. The glue used with fake eyelashes may irritate or damage your eyelashes.
 Giving your eyelids a gentle massage can help increase the blood flow, which can help your lashes grow. Wash your hands and face well. Then apply gentle pressure with the pads of your fingers to massage your eyelids and lash line.Make sure not to pull too hard. Also be careful not to pull on your lashes so that you accidentally yank them out.
 Removing your makeup every night is important for healthy, strong eyelashes, but you should be careful. If you rub too hard to try to remove mascara, you can break the lashes, pull them out, or cause them to be brittle. Use a gentle makeup remover. Press it onto your lashes and let it sit instead of rubbing hard.

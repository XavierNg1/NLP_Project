 Measure out 2 cups (474 ml) of regular Mountain Dew and pour it into a tall glass. Add in the cup (237 ml) of Gatorade and stir to combine. As the two liquids come together, the drink will take on an aquamarine color similar to Baja Blast.


To make a larger batch, double or triple the quantities of each drink. Stick with a two-to-one ratio of Mountain Dew and Gatorade.Even though Baja Blast has a tropical-lime flavor, the best homemade version uses Cool Blue Gatorade, and not any of the lime or tropical flavors.;
, For a refreshing cold beverage, add a few cubes of ice to the glass and serve it chilled. You can also refrigerate the drink for 30 minutes to chill it without watering it down.
 You can also turn your Baja Blast into a slushy, and to do that you'll need plenty of ice and a blender. Combine the Baja Blast in the blender with about 18 cubes of ice. Blend the mixture on Snow or Ice Crush mode for about a minute, or until there are no large chunks of ice left.


Transfer the slushy to a tall glass and enjoy.

 This method is useful when you can't remove a CD because your CD player will no longer turn on. This method involves disconnecting, then reconnecting the electrical supply to the CD player. For most CD players, this means that any radio presets you've set will be erased and your personal audio settings will be reset to their defaults. If you're an avid listener of music in your car, make sure you record your personal settings so they can easily be restored afterward.
 When manipulating or altering your car's electrical system, it's important to ensure you're not in danger of electrocution. Turn the car off and remove the keys from the ignition, then open the hood for access to the battery.
 The negative terminal on a car's battery is colored black, while the positive terminal is colored red. Carefully disconnect the negative terminal. Some terminals may require you to use a small wrench or pliers to loosen a nut before removing the wire connection.
 After reconnecting the terminal, tun the car on and try to eject the CD as normal. Disconnecting then reconnecting the CD player's power supply can cause the CD player to "reset" to its factory default, which, in some cases, can restore its ejection functionality.
 Check your owner's manual - often, a car's fuse box will be behind a panel somewhere on the driver's side of the dashboard. Disconnect the battery, remove the fuse box's protective covering, then, consulting your owner's manual, replace any of your CD player's fuses that may have blown.

 Most people do not want night shifts, but as the new nurse, you will have to be prepared to survive it. Some departments have no openings on day shift for many years, depending on the turnover of the nurses. To be ready, get enough sleep. Aim for seven to nine hours per day.


This can be very hard for nurses with 12 hour nights to do, so on your days off, you may need extra rest, or a nap before work.A lot of people get sales calls during the day, it can make your sleep very broken. Try to keep your phone off so you can rest.
 To keep yourself energized, you need to exercise. Exercising in the morning is ideal for a lot of people and can warm up your body. This will keep you more energized during your shift and help keep you awake. Don't over do it because you don't want to expend all your energy.


You should also eat well balanced small meals and healthy foods. Especially on night shift, nurses get tired and their bodies crave sugar. Avoid sugary beverages and caffeine loaded drinks that can leave you dehydrated and crashed later in the night.
The morning for a night shift nurse is not morning, but when you wake up., There are certain activities that will help you adjust your schedule. Shower before work to help you wake up. Try to stick to your normal morning routine, even if it is 3pm when you wake up. Keep your phone on silent. If you have a choice, try to not work one night on, one night off, and another night on. It will throw your body off very badly because it won’t know how to sleep.


Try to get your family to understand. They won’t understand, they never will. They need to know that your 2pm time is their 2am time. You need rest and they need to understand not to wake you and that you may miss certain events.

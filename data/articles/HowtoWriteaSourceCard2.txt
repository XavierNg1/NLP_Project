 Like with a book, place the author’s name on the first line in the upper left-hand corner of the card, with the last name first. Let’s say our author’s name is Jo Ross. It will look like this:


Ross, Jo.
 The title should be at the top of the article. The title of the article we’re looking at is “Analysis of the Behavior of Grey Cats,” which you’ll add below the author’s name. Remember that the titles of journal articles should go in quotations, they should not be underlined like book titles..


Ross, Jo.
"Analysis of the Behavior of Grey Cats"

, If you’re working online, the journal title should be listed somewhere below the author in the database page or at the top or bottom of the journal article. If you’re working in print, the journal name should be on the front cover. Our journal is titled “The Sociology of Cats” — it should go under the article title and be underlined:


Ross, Jo.
"Analysis of the Behavior of Grey Cats"
The Sociology of Cats

, With a journal, the date could be a month and year or a day, month, and year. In this example, the article was published in February of 2002, so write the month and year, followed by a colon:


Ross, Jo.
"Analysis of the Behavior of Grey Cats"

The Sociology of Cats Feb. 2002:

, One piece of information you need to include with a journal article that you don’t need with a book is the volume and issue numbers. These should be located in the bibliographic information online, or at the front of the journal or in the header or footer in print. In this example, the volume number is 14 and the issue number is 2. Occasionally, journal articles won’t have these numbers.

, The page numbers tell your reader where in the journal the article can be found, which is why they are important to include on your source card. In this example, the article is located on pages 22-54. Add it below the volume and issue information:

The Sociology of Cats Feb. 2002:
14(2)
22-44

, Finally, make sure to add the location of the source, whether you found it on a database, website, or in a print publication. In this example, the journal article was found in EBSCOhost on the Sociology Database:

 Your patterned fabric can be anything you want it to be. It can be baby-themed, or nursery-themed, or simply something that you find pretty.
 This will remove any shrinking and starches. When drying your fabric, avoid using dryer sheets, as they may reduce the absorbency. Lastly, be sure to iron your fabric. This will help stretch it back out as well as remove any wrinkles.
 This will be long enough to wrap over the front of your diaper, with extra space for the hems.
 Take your fabric strip, and turn it so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold both of the long edges down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and press them flat with an iron., With the wrong side of the fabric still facing you, fold both of the narrow edges down by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters). Press them flat with an iron.
 Turn your diaper so that one of the narrow edges is facing you. Place the fabric strip down on top of it and center it. Make sure that both ends of the fabric strip are hanging over the edges of your diaper by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Once you are happy with the placement, pin the fabric strip in place.Don't worry about folding the ends of your fabric strip down just yet. You will do that later.
 A good way to do this would be to position the edge of your strip so that it aligns with the center of your presser foot, then shifting the needle off to the side, so that it catches onto the fabric. Topstitch first one side, then the other. Remove the pins as you sew.


Use a thread color that matches your patterned fabric, and a bobbin color that matches your diaper.
Be sure to backstitch at the start and end of you sewing, so that the stitching doesn't come undone.
 You will have a hem that is between ½ and 1 inch (1.27 and 2.54 centimeters) thick, depending on the bulk of your diaper. Secure the hem down with sewing pins.
 Be sure to switch out the bobbin thread so that it matches the patterned fabric. Backstitch as the start and end of your sewing, and remove the pins as you go.

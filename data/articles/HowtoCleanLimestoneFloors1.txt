 To start, take a microfiber cloth. Wipe it across the floor to remove any obvious dirt and debris, such as spilled food or dust. A microfiber cloth should easily lift obvious messes off of a limestone floor., Any ingrained dirt should be scrubbed away before you give your floor a general mopping. For limestone, use a detergent formula specifically created for calciferous stone. You can purchase this online or at a local supermarket. Dilute your detergent with water, using a ratio of one parts detergent to five parts water.It should say somewhere on a cleaner's label what types of floors it's appropriate for. Do not use a detergent unless it specifies it can be used on limestone.
 Apply your detergent to spots where there is built up grime. Let it sit for 10 to 20 minutes. Use a cleaning brush to scrub out the dirt and grime from your floor.Keep in mind, if you clean your floor regularly, there may not be built up dirt. If this is the case, skip this step and proceed to general mopping.
 After removing dirt and grime, wipe away the dirty cleaner from the floor using a mop soaked in clean water. After wiping away dirty cleaner, pat the floors dry with a clean towel.

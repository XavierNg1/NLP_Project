 If your sling has rings, the process for setting it up is a bit different. First, put the side of the sling with the rings along the shoulder opposite to the hip or arm you typically use to carry your child. In other words, if you usually carry your baby on your right side, then set the rings on your left shoulder. Let the part of the sling without rings fall freely down your back.
 Spread the sling out completely.
 Take the end of the sling without rings, which has fallen down your back, and bring it to your front by passing it under your arm. Spread the sling again.


Make sure, at this point, that the sling isn’t twisted on your back.
 Grasp the end of the sling and wrinkle it so that it will fit, then pass it through both rings.


Note that these rings are functional; you can customize the size of the sling to fit your child’s age and size.
 Bring the end of the sling back over the top ring and down through the bottom ring. Check to see that you can tighten it by pulling on the end.


Once the sling is secured, you don’t have to untie it. You can simply remove it as is, hang it up, and, when you wear it again, adjust the size as needed.

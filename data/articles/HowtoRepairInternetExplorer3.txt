 These are free programs that will scan your computer for malware that may be causing problems with Internet Explorer. If you can't open Internet Explorer, you'll need to download these with another browser or on another computer. Popular programs include:


Malwarebytes Anti-Malware
Spybot Search & Destroy
Adwcleaner
Lavasoft Adaware

, Install each of the programs, but don't start the scans yet.
 This will allow the anti-malware software to detect more malware. For detailed instructions on booting in Safe Mode, click here.


Reboot your computer.
Repeatedly press F8 as the computer starts up.
Select Safe Mode with Networking from the Advanced Startup menu.
 Each program scans for slightly different things, so it's important to run all of them.


If given the option, perform a Full or Deep scan instead of a Quick scan.
Malware scans may take a while to complete.
 While you're in Safe Mode, you should also run a full scan using your antivirus program. It may be able to detect things it normally couldn't.
 After running all of your scans and removing infected entries, you can reboot your computer to start Windows normally.


If your problems aren't fixed, see the next section.

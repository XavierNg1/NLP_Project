 Every teacher assigns some work that is either redundant or simply not necessary and in some cases, you may not need to complete it to understand the materials. Chances are other students do need the extra practice though. If the assignment is a worksheet or closely resembles something else you’ve done in the class, it is probably busy work. If this is the case, work through the busy work quickly. Don’t give it more time than is absolutely necessary. Just show your teacher you can do it and move on to more pressing assignments.
 Too often we try to complete several assignments in one sitting. Rather than inundating your brain with information, compartmentalize your school work. Finish your math homework, take a break, and come back to study for your science test 15 minutes later. This method will help you process the information.
 Start with the hardest or most important stuff first and then move to the easiest and least significant work. This way if you run out of time or steam, you’ll have the most important assignments done first.For example, complete your physics study guide assignment that is worth a significant portion of your grade before you do your English journal entry that is barely worth anything.
 There are three steps to writing a great paper — research, writing, and editing. Compartmentalize these steps. Compile all the info needed to complete the essay. Write the essay. Then edit it. Don’t blend these steps. It will take you longer to complete the essay as a whole and you’ll inevitably backtrack needlessly.


Don’t stress about each sentence while you’re writing. Get your basic ideas out on the page. And then go back and edit.When you go back to edit, you can use a thesaurus to help dress up your language.

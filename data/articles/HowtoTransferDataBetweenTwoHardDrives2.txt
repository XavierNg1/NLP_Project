 Because of the dramatic drop in the price of storage, coupled with the dramatic increase in bandwidth, making your second hard drive virtual is an idea to consider. It's safe, secure, and perhaps best of all—it's backed up constantly, off site, in secure locations.


Cloud storage also gives you access to all your data no matter where you are, or what machine you're using.
 They are solutions that provide, for free, from 2GB of storage to unlimited storage. Not only do they provide storage and retrieval from any location, they both let you share files with other people and groups, add notes to files, and much more.



Evernote gives you unlimited storage, but you can only upload 50MB per month for free.

Dropbox gives you 2GB for free, but has no maximum upload limit.
Once signed up, simply drag your files to a folder you've created on the service.
 If your needs are simply to make sure all your files are backed up regularly and securely, consider using a cloud-based backup service. You schedule when the backups happen, and you can be confident your files are ready for you no matter what, when, or where.



Carbonite, which is designed to back up your computer only—no external hard drives—lets you access those files anywhere, and read them on any device, whether that be another computer, an iPad, or an Android. Carbonite offers unlimited storage for a few dollars a month.

Mozy has pricing plans that vary, and lets you save up to 125GB of data on up to 3 computers. For business owners and those with critical files, Mozy will send you a restore disk in the mail (for a modest fee) should the need arise.

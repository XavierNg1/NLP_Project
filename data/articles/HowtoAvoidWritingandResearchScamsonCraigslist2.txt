 As mentioned previously, do your homework on the company and ask for clarification of anything you do not understand or would like to have explained further.


If the business and job posting is legitimate, your contact will be happy to answer your questions.
 If you can’t find much information online about the company, or you simply feel like something is slightly off, ask your contact for references. These professional references should be able to vouch for the company you are applying to. Ask for the reference’s name, company, number and email address. Once you have this information, you can research the person and company to ensure they are legitimate.These references could include:


Vendors who has worked with the company.
Partners of the company.
Customers.
 Know what you are getting into. Ask about the supervisor or manager, what the job duties are, and anything else you wish to know before going further in the interview process. If you find that the company doesn’t sound like it would be a good fit for you, or you feel like something is off about the company, stop the application process.
 If you are writing an article or report, ask where your writing will be posted and/or who the readers are. If you are conducting research, ask who will be reviewing this research, what the higher purpose is and if or where this will be available for people to view.


It is important to know what the purpose of your writing is. If you are writing a pro-chocolate report and find out your article is going to published as the sensationalist views of a chocolate-lover in an anti-chocolate magazine, you might want to think twice before sending in your article.
 Know how much and when you will get paid. Avoid any jobs that offer an over-the-top amount or ‘too good to be true’ promises, since they are most likely not true.


Researching the going rate for the job you are applying for will help you to spot empty promises.

 Some paintings require a background color. This will be different depending on your subject matter. If you need one, you have to start off with this. Using a large brush, paint your background color across the canvas. Make sure this is before you start to apply your other paints or sketch out your image., Now that you primed your canvas , you have your brushes, and you have chosen your paints, you can start work on your canvas. You should already have an idea of what you want to paint since you have chosen the colors that you need. At this point, you can sketch the outline of what you want to paint across the surface of your canvas before you start to paint. If you are working on a more abstract, free slowing work, you can just begin painting on the canvas., If you are working on a subject, you need to start with the low and highlights. Apply the darkest and lightest colors that you are going to use onto the sketch you made. From here, you can build up the middle ground shades on top of them, blending them as you go.If you are using oil paints, make sure you clean your brushes with turpentine between uses. If not, you will get paint build up and it will ruin your brushes. If you are using acrylics or watercolors, rinsing them out in water is fine.

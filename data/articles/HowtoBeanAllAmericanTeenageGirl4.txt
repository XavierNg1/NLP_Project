 Americans are renowned for being super friendly, so the “all-American” girl is interested in other people. As the saying goes, “a stranger is just a friend you haven’t met yet.” Standing in line at the store, sitting in a waiting room, and waiting for class to start on the first day are all great opportunities to make low-stakes small talk. Just asking someone how they’re doing is a great way to meet a new person and make them feel good.
 One easy way to project “all-American” friendliness is to smile at people. This is easy even if you’re shy. Smile at everyone you meet—people you walk past on the street, your waiter or waitress, the person taking tickets at the movies. This makes you feel good, it makes others feel good, and it makes your interactions with people more pleasant.
 America is a diverse country, and modern Americans are proud of that diversity. When you’re an “all-American” girl, you accept the differences between you and the people you meet, even if you don’t understand them. Be friendly to everyone, no matter what they look like or where they come from. Try to get to know them better. It can be fun!

 People are losing the basic skills of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Instead of using what they learned in school, they’re just pulling out their cell phones or calculator. If your math skills have gotten dull, start doing math in your head.If you need to use pen and paper to work out the problems, that’s okay.
 Cell phones have made leaving a tip so much easier because you can use a tip calculator app instead of doing math. Instead of using your phone, calculate the tip yourself on a napkin.


If calculating 15 or 18% is too difficult at first, start with 20%. That is an easier percentage to calculate by hand.
 Many people don't wear watches anymore because they use their cell phones to tell time. Try wearing an analog watch where you have to read the time based on the hands instead of just easily reading the numbers.
 In some cases, using your phone or tablet may be unavoidable, but you can still keep your mind sharp. Many apps can help you improve your math skills by giving you problems to solve. There are even apps, such as Maths Alarm Clock or FreakyAlarm, that will force you to answer a math problem before turning off your morning alarm. These can help you keep yourself alert and focused, even as you use technology.

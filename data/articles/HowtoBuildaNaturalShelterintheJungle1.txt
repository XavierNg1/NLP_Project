Avoid sinking soil.






Avoid areas likely to fill quickly with water in the event of a flash flood.






Choose high ground that is located away from swamps and dry river beds.
 Since you'll need to procure raw materials and cut and bind them together, you'll need to use your ingenuity to find materials that take the place of what you'd normally have if you don't already have a pocket knife and rope. Some alternatives include:


Sharpened stick, sharp-edged stones for cutting






Vines, reeds, bandannas, clothing pieces, strong young tree growth, etc. for tying






Leaves, grasses, clumps of mossy material, etc. for bedding, cover, and warmth.

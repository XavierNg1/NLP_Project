 Rigid shoes that do not allow your baby’s feet to move around can actually hurt your baby’s feet and inhibit them from developing correctly if he has not begun to walk yet. Before your baby begins walking, he really only needs a pair of non-slip socks or booties to get around in. Aside from keeping his feet warm in the cold weather, the only other reason to put shoes on a non-walking baby would be to complement his outfit and add to his style.;
, Your baby’s first pair of shoes should be a strong, yet flexible shoe that has a good grip for walking. These shoes will help to protect your baby’s feet and give them the room they need to grow and develop properly. Your baby’s balance will not be perfect when he or she is beginning to walk, so a good pair of shoes with non-slip soles is very important because falls will happen.


When buying your baby’s first shoe, also be sure to thoroughly check how well the shoe fits before you leave the store. Have your baby stand up in the shoe to make sure he has enough room for his foot to expand and move about freely. Also check to ensure that the shoe does not slide up and down on the back of the foot because this may cause the shoe to rub excessively against the surface of his skin, which can give your baby blisters.
It will be easier to find the right fit if you shop for your baby’s shoe in the afternoon or early evening. Your baby’s feet can swell up later in the day so if you buy shoes early in the day, the shoes may not fit properly later in the evening.

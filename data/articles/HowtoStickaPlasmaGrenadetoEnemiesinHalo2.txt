 There are several ways to do this.


One way is to empty their shield (fastest way is with the Plasma Pistol), and as they stagger, throw the grenade.






Another way is to run up to them. When they try to punch you, move out of the way while throwing the grenade.






A third way is just to throw it, but that's not a good strategy if the enemy is moving.

, Usually, the grenade would fall before it hit the enemy when your cross-hairs are on them, so it's not a good idea to attempt the stick.


If they are close, throw it right at them. If they're a little further, throw it in front of them so they walk right into it.

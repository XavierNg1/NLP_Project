 You want to be healthy enough to fully participate in and benefit from the fast. You also need to make sure you are strong enough to forgo other nutrients. Children and women who are pregnant should not partake of the pineapple fast.


The fast should last at least 3 days and no more than 10. Ask your doctor how long you should fast based on your current health. Also ask about the benefits of a pineapple diet for weight loss if that is an area of concern.
A pineapple fast can be especially helpful for smokers who are quitting. Smokers have noted that they feel as if they can breathe easier following the pineapple fast. However, it may take up to a year or longer to completely remove toxins in a smoker's lungs.;
, Stop smoking at least 7 days before you start your pineapple fast. You'll also want to get rid of alcohol, eggs, meat and fish at least a week before you begin.


It's never a good idea to start a fast if you're feeling sick. Your body is going to go through a lot in the next 3 to 10 days -- so start when you're in optimal shape. If you have serious health concerns, do not take part in this fast.

 It is important to cut the fabric for the tie on the bias (diagonally across the grain) which will allow the tie to have more elasticity. Remember to make sure the fabric is laid out smoothly with no creases.








If the fabric is patterned, envision how the pattern will look once you cut the fabric out. Rearrange the layout of your pattern to make sure it will show nicely.
 Use a weight or pin to hold the pattern outline down. Then, use a piece of chalk to carefully trace around the outline onto the "wrong" side of the fabric. Chalk is a safe and easy tracing tool for this type of project.
 Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut the fabric about 3/8in around the outside of the chalk line. This will leave room for you to sew the inseam.If you're using a fabric that's more difficult to work with, you might want to use a rotary cutter instead.









Cut slowly to avoid making a mistake and wasting fabric.
 Lay the tie outline on the interfacing and use chalk to trace the outline. Then, carefully cut out the interfacing using sharp scissors or a rotary cutter. The interfacing will end up having the same shape as the fabric you cut, but it wonâ€™t need added seam allowance so cut directly on the chalk line.
 You will need to measure out your back liner to fit the bottom diamond of your tie. This will be used to cover the back of your tie that will be left exposed after your tie is folded over and sewed. It is also a nice place to tuck in the back tail of the tie. It will be cut straight across on top, and then follow the bottom cuts of the tie pattern.

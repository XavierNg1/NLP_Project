 While standing, hold the sheet horizontally in front of you. Fold the ends together, until the sheet is the proper length for your height. It should cover from your waist to your feet.
 Holding the folded sheet horizontally behind you at your waist, wrap a few feet of one end around your front-side to make a skirt and tuck the top of the skirt-end into the sheet, like a towel. Keep the rest behind your back.
 While still holding the sheet at your waist wrap the longer end around to the front. When you cross the front, pin the top of the skirt together at your waist.
 Continue this longer end all the way around your body, across the front of your waist, under your arm, and across your the back. Then back to the front again, under your arm.
 Once the longer end is at the front again, cross over your chest and over the opposite shoulder. The end will drape over your shoulder and rest on your back.


If you have a rope, use it to wrap around the small of you back to secure the loose end hanging in the back.

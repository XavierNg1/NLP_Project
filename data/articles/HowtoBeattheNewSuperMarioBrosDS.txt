 Here are the basics:


A=Jump
Y=Make Mario go faster.
Control Pad= Makes Mario walk.
Start= Pause.;
, World 1 is mostly a grassland/calm world as it is were Princess Peaches Castle is.
, A dark red mushroom will come along. These are goombas and they harm you. Jump on it in order to defeat it. Keep playing along. The rest will come naturally.
 If you do then you will know the controls better and the enemies better as well.
 These are mushroom houses, each holding useful items for you. You must use star coins to unlock them. Star coins are found in levels and there is three per level. Here is a guide to the mushroom houses.


Green mushrooms: 1-Ups, these will give you extra lives.
Yellow mushrooms: These contain one giant mushroom which will make Mario a giant.
Red mushroom: These hold miscellaneous power ups.
 Towers have Bowser Junior. Bowser's son. The towers are full of traps and dangerous things. To defeat Bowser Jr. you must jump on him three times. Later in the game you must use shells to make him fall over before you can jump on him.
 Again, these are full of traps and harder than towers. You will come across a different boss in each castle. Bowser however appears in the World 1 castle and world 8 castles.
 Here is the key to getting to those worlds.


World 4: Defeat the World 2 boss as mini Mario. This will be hard however as if mini Mario is hit once, he dies.
World 7: Defeat the World 5 boss as mini Mario. You can also get to World 7 by using the World 4 cannon.
 Its confusing and dangerous. Luckily there are guides online guiding you through the rest of the game and the castle.
 The best method to defeat them is to get a mega mushroom which makes Mario giant.
 You've completed the game. Now you can get all the star coins, 99 lives and more.

 Feed the right side of the shoelace down through the lowest right eyelet and feed the left side of the shoelace down through the left eyelet to create a straight line between the two eyelets.


Make sure the laces are the same length before moving on.;
, Take the shoestring on the left side of the shoe and cross it over to feed it down through the second eyelet on the right side of the shoe. Then, take the shoestring on the right side of the shoe and cross it over to feed it down through the second eyelet on the left side of the shoe.You should end up with a straight line between the bottom two eyelets, and an “x” between the second two eyelets.
The laces should be coming through the second eyelets towards the inside of the shoe.
 Continue to cross the shoestring end over and feeding them down into the eyelets to lace up the shoe. Stop when you get the last eyelets.


Make sure you are always feeding the shoestring down through the eyelets towards the inside of the shoe.
 When you reach the last eyelets, you need to tie off the shoestring to secure it in place. Take the shoestring on the left side of the shoe and make a knot in the string close to the eyelet on the inside of the shoe. Repeat this process with the shoestring on the right side of the shoe.
 After tying secure knots, you can cut off the excess shoestring. Leave about one half to one inch of shoestring after the knot and then cut off the rest. Cutting off the extra shoestring helps prevents the possibility of injury due to laces getting caught in your skateboard.If you don’t want to cut your laces, you can tie them in a bow inside your shoe behind the tongue instead.

You can also mix this by hand.;
,, If mixing by hand, use a wooden spoon to mix thoroughly.
 Cook over a low flame, stirring continuously.
 There should still be some moisture left to avoid the mixture turning rubbery but the dough should be well formed by this stage. This will take around 5 minutes or so.
 Transfer the dough to a wide, shallow dish (such as a thali or a low bowl) and allow it to cool enough to be handled safely.
 When it is cool enough to handle, knead the dough gently. Knead until a smooth ball forms.
 Place the ball on a baking sheet covered in parchment paper, then slightly flatten with your thumb, pushing an indentation into the middle of the sweet. This indentation will hold any garnish you may wish to add.
, The garnish can be any of the following or a combination of them: chopped pistachios, chopped almonds, chopped cashews, chopped raisins or sultanas, grated chocolate, etc.
 The chocolate sandesh is best served once made, while it remains room temperature soft. If you are not able to serve it straight away, refrigerate it until serving time. Refrigeration will harden the mixture though, which isn't as desirable a texture for eating.

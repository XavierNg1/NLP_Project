 Understanding the job, a company’s history, and where the company is heading are all key to crafting a position-specific resume. Utilize the company’s website and social media profiles to conduct your research.
 You don’t need to put everything on every resume you submit. Keep a master list of all jobs and experience and use this to craft concise, position-specific resumes that market you as a great fit for the job. Three pages or less is more than sufficient.Start with your current or most recent job and list no more than a total of five positions.
For example, if you are applying for a job as a teacher you probably don’t need to include the pet store job you worked in high school.
 Be specific and to the point about how you progressed in a particular position. For example, if you gradually took on increased responsibilities over the course of your internship, highlight this in your resume., Employers don’t want you to tell them about what you accomplished, they want to see it demonstrated in a tangible way on your resume. Be clear about outcomes and how these contributed to the overall success of a particular project or organization. For example, if you designed an educational program at the local museum as part of your internship, include information on how many school groups and individuals participated. This will demonstrate a tangible outcome from your work.
 Flashy, over-the-top, and exceptionally lengthy resumes will do little to increase your odds of being hired for a position. Your efforts may instead come off as desperate, juvenile, or self-serving. Get back to the basics and craft a resume that illustrates results and authenticity, and pair it with a cover letter that demonstrates your understanding of what a potential employer wants.

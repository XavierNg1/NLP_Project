 A call that only lasts for a couple of minutes can leave you and your contact feeling awkward. Texts, on the other hand, get right to the point. If you just want to shoot the breeze with a friend in short bursts or ask a short question, a text is a safe choice., Messages that don’t require an immediate reply can be texted. This way, your contact can take time to relax from a long day, eat a meal, etc. without feeling forced to get back to you immediately. Examples of non-urgent messages include:


Asking the person you’re dating to get together Friday night.
Telling someone you’ll be somewhere in a few minutes.
Asking your significant other to pick up some bread on the way home.
Relaying any kind of message that doesn’t need a reply for at least two hours.
 Calls take your attention away from what you’re doing. A text message, on the other hand, can wait until you finish your work. If you think your contact might be in a meeting, teaching a class, or typing up a report, send a text.Give them a few hours to reply before retexting.
 Maybe you share an office with several other people. Maybe you live with a third-shift worker who sleeps during your waking hours. Situations like these call for courtesy. If your voice will distract others from their work or wake someone who is sleeping, opt to send a text message—and set your phone to vibrate for the reply., Texting is increasingly common among new couples who haven’t formed emotional bonds yet. However, advice columns vary from promoting textingto warning against it altogether.What should you do? Ask! It’s the best way to get a clear answer.


Something simple like, “So, should I text you, or do you prefer phone calls?” should do the trick.

Start with some simple free ways to advertise, like telling your friends and family. They may love the product you sell and spread the word.
 For example if you sell plant seeds, use keywords like seeds, planting seeds, and gardening. Think of relevant search phrases too, like marigold seeds, or pumpkin seeds. But don't just use keywords, write a little bit and use your keywords in sentences.
 A successful on-line store starts with you being found.


Use social media to create some buzz.
Use Instagram.
Create a Facebook page for your business. You will want to write a short story about your business. Remember to stay active and post pictures of your products as you make them, and include links to your store. Invite everyone you know to join your group and have them "like" your group and "share" your new products.
Make a blog about the subject of your business and write in it at least once every day. It's fine to let your personality shine through on your blog but make sure you don't have any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. You want this to look both personable and professional.

 Some Firefox add-ons can be acquired outside of the built-in add-on interface. Navigate to the website that hosts your desired extension file and download it. Firefox extension files use the .xpi filetype (cross-platform installer).


XPI files can be acquired from external installation links by right-clicking and selecting “Save Link As…” if you prefer to install manually or want installers for archiving purposes.
 Go to Settings (☰) > Add-ons. This page will display any installed extensions. From here you can update, remove, or search for new extensions and add-ons.


This page can also be accessed by typing “about:addons” into the address bar.
 From the add-ons interface, press Settings (gear icon) next to the add-on search bar. This will open a menu of add-on specific controls.
 This will bring up a file explorer window.
 A notification will appears to the left of the address bar that an external source wants to install an add on.
 Press “Install” in the notification and restart Firefox if necessary.

 A shortwave radio can tune to frequencies that includes WWV / WWVH. Cheap shortwave radios can be purchased from your local electrical store. If you don't want to use a shortwave radio, then you can use an online receiver such as Global Tuners or the Twente Web SDR to tune to WWV / WWVH.;
, For the ones who uses an online receiver, tune the online receiver to the WWV / WWVH frequencies.
 If you have a pair of headphones, connect your headphones to your shortwave radio or computer.
 If you're using Windows,  double-click the time on the taskbar. When the "Time and Date Properties" box appears, click "Change date and time" .
 When WWV / WWVH double ticks at the nine second (i.e. 11:02:09 UTC), click the "OK" button. You can also click the "OK" button when the station chimes at the beginning of the minute (i.e. 11:02:00 UTC). For those who live outside the UTC time zone, set your clock according to your local time zone.
 Your computer clock is now synced with WWV / WWVH. Remember to repeat the same steps if your computer clock loses a second again.

 Flatten your bandana on the table. A square bandana works best for this style. Position it like a diamond, and fold it in half to form a triangle.





;
, Fold the base of the triangle up about 1–2 inch (2.5–5 cm) toward the tip of the triangle. Crease the fold and repeat, folding until the bandana is a narrow rectangle.
 For a simple headband look, place the center of the strip against your forehead. Tie the ends around the back of your head, using two knots to keep it secure.
 Alternatively, place the middle of your bandana strip on the center of the hairline on the back of your neck. Move your two hands toward the edges of the strip and pull it onto the top of your head.Tie a double knot on top of your head. Take the short ends sticking out of the knot and open the folds of the bandana to create your bow.









Flip your head over if you’ve decided to wear your hair down. Once you’ve pulled the corners to the top of your head, flip your head back over so you can see what you’re tying.
 If you want the bow to be off-center, now is your time to move it. Simply grab the knot with one hand and the middle of your bandana with the other and shift it until it reaches your desired spot. Pin the bandana near your ears and at the knot to keep it from shifting further.

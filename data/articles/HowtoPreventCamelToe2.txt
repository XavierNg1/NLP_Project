 If you want to avoid camel toe, don’t go “commando” (without underwear). Going without underwear will increase the chances you’ll have this problem.


This is especially true with fabric that is especially thin or made out of material that stretches or is lighter in color. If you don’t wear underwear with such already unsupported fabric, you’ve got a double problem.
Wear thicker panties. The panties are less likely to cause camel toe because they won’t get pulled into your private parts as easily. Thicker panties will also provide some support, smoothing out lines.
 Try to buy jeans, slacks or workout gear that contains multiple seams.


For example, you could look for clothing with seams that have a V formation in the crotch area.
Clothing that has a single seam running through the crotch area is more prone to camel toe. That’s because the looser fabric will more easily creep into your private area.
 This holds true for workout pants as well as for blue jeans. The higher the waist, and the more likely you are to get camel toe.Try on clothing, squat and sit in it inside the fitting room before you purchase it to test it out for camel toe. Avoid the "mom jeans" look. Jeans that ride up the hips could cause you a camel toe problem (not to mention being uncomfortable and unflattering).
Choose pants and workout clothes that fit comfortably on your hips. You want to avoid clothing that will ride up and bunch in your privates area.

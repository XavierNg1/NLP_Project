 Some vegetarians do not eat dairy products, as milk, butter, and cream all come from animals. If you do not want to have sweets that contain dairy, you will need to buy chocolates for Valentine's Day that are marked "dairy free." Look for boxed chocolates that are dairy free at your local supermarket or online.

You may need to visit a specialty chocolate shop for dairy free chocolates and sweets. Often, dairy free sweets are made with coconut oil, rather than butter or cream, and pure dark cocoa, rather than milk chocolate.
 If you are going out to eat, check the menu to see if there are any vegan desserts available. Most vegetarian restaurants will offer desserts that do not contain animal products. There may also be an existing dessert on the menu that can be modified to be vegan or dairy free.

Many ethnic restaurants will offer vegan desserts, such as mango pudding made with coconut milk at an Indian restaurant.
 If you are whipping up a vegetarian Valentine's Day meal at home and want to end with a yummy dessert, make vegan sweets. Prepare a vegan moist orange cake or a vegan mint chocolate cake. Make a vegan cheesecake or vegan cupcakes finished off with pink, Valentine's Day themed icing.

You can also try adapting an existing recipe so it is dairy free or vegan. You may use substitutes like vegan butter or coconut oil to do this.

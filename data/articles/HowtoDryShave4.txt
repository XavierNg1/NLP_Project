 Rinse the razor u/nder water to clean out any remaining hairs from between the blades. Tap the razor against the sink or tub wall to help dislodge hairs as well. Cleaning a reusable razor will prolong the life of the blade.


If you used a disposable razor you can simply throw it away.
Consider dipping the razor in rubbing alcohol to help dry out the blade and prevent rust from forming.
 Cup your hands under the faucet to catch some cold water, then splash it against your skin. Do this for 30-40 seconds. Cooling the skin down with water will help to close your pores and soothe the skin. If you have any nicks, the cool water will help stop the bleeding.
 If you shaved your face, you can apply an aftershave to tone the skin or moisturize it. Aftershaves are either made with a base of alcohol or witch hazel oil. Alcohol will add more tone to the skin, but can also dry skin out. Witch hazel is better at moisturizing the skin, but does not add as much tone as aftershave.
 Shaving can be rough on your skin, you can even lose some of your skin in the process. Keep your skin looking and feeling healthy by treating it with some non-alcohol and fragrant-free moisturizers.Simply place a dollop on your hands, then massage the lotion gently into your skin.

 This is the mode you will be fighting Undyne in. In this mode, your soul cannot move and has a spear, given to you by Undyne, to block her attacks.;
,, This will happen soon after you go into the arena. Your soul mode will be red.


Soul mode red is the default soul mode. It allows you to move along the fighting box with the arrow keys without any restraint.
Undyne will turn your soul to the green mode with a spear.
 To do this you move the arrow keys to move your spear. The top arrow shields the top of your soul, etc. You must block six attacks.


After six attacks, she will turn your soul to the red soul mode again. Take this advantage to flee. When you escape, run as fast and far away from Undyne as you can.
 You will enter another fight. Luckily, for this fight, you must only block four attacks before you can flee.
 Block eight attacks and flee. While you are running, you will get a call from Papyrus.


Undyne will not move during this call. After that, keep running until you reach Hotland and then you will have successfully spared Undyne.

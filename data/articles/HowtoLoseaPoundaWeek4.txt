 As you become more fit, your body will grow accustomed to the workouts you're putting it through. If you only read one genre of books, would you be well-read? No. So keep surprising your body -- it needs to be as well-balanced as you are.


Vary the duration, intensity, and frequency, and type of activities you do. If you like walking, do it uphill, downhill, inside, and outside and for different amounts of time. If you're a swimmer, try rowing. Dancer? Take a step class. Your attention will last longer to boot.
 In this path to weight loss, there are gonna be days where a candy bar can and will solve all your problems. That's fine. Just make sure you realize that after the candy bar, you're gonna start fresh. Don't let the occasional setback tell you to give up.


Staying positive is key to maintaining motivation. If you're hard on yourself, it'll be that much easier to give up. Concentrate on your progress, not what you wish you were capable of. In addition to writing down what you eat and drink in your journal, write down the milestones you've hit and the new things you've accomplished, exercise-wise.
 Sometimes our current situation just stares us in the face and it's hard to remember that our current selves determine our future selves. It may seem like a lot of work now, but the benefits in the future are truly great. Remember who you're on the path to being and keep your head up. Eventually the future will be now.


Focusing on the future will orient you to your goals. If you concentrate too much on the present, it's easy to get bogged down by worry or complacency. Unfortunately, immediate gratification isn't how worthwhile things work. Remind yourself of why you started this journey in the first place and how good it'll feel to meet your goals.

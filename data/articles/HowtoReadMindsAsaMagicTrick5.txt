 This awesome trick exploits certain common quirks in human psychology. Though you give your spectator choices that seem like they have many different possible answers, most people will guess exactly the same thing, which, at the end of the trick, you'll guess, to the likely amazement of your volunteer. Start by asking the volunteer to think of any number between 1 and 5, but not to reveal it.
 For example, if your volunteer picked the number 5, 9 Ã— 5 = 45, so s/he will add 4 + 5 to get 9. This should be done mentally, not out loud.
 9 - 5 = 4, so, at this point, your volunteer will have the number 4 in his or her head.
 For example, the number 1 corresponds to A, 2 to B, etc. At this point, they will have the number 4, regardless of what number they initially picked, so they will pick the letter D.
 Most of the time, people will think of the country Denmark.
 The last letter in "Denmark" is "K", and most people will associate the letter K with kangaroos.
 The last letter in "Kangaroo" is "O". Orange is the only common color that starts with O.
 Make a big show of squinting and pressing your fingers to your temples. Tell your spectator that you are searching deep in the depths of his or her psyche.
 Nine times out of ten, your volunteer will react with amazement, though occasionally you'll get someone who picks "Koala" or "Djibouti" or another answer.

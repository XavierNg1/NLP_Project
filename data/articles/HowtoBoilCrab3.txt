 The flap of shell on the underside of a crab, called the abdomen or apron, must be removed. You can simply use your fingers to do this. It should come off easily, especially after cleaning and boiling., Stick your thumb in the hole just to left of where you removed the abdomen. Lift up firmly. The outer shell should come off with some guts attached.
 You will see a pair of leaf-like, spongy gills on either side of the crab. These should be removed and discarded.
 Some greenish-brown guts will be attached to the crab's body. Rinse them out in your sink, making sure all of the guts are thoroughly removed as they are not suitable for consumption., The mandibles are the mouth parts attached to the front of the crab. Simply break them off and then discard.



Turn the crab upside down and grip it on either side. Place your thumbs under the mid-line of the back, where the shell used to be.
Push up with your thumbs and down with your hands. The crab should crack in half easily., Just to make sure any lingering guts and shell bits are removed, give the crab a good final rinse in the sink.

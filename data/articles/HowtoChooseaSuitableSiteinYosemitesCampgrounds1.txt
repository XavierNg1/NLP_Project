 If you are looking to spread out and enjoy some privacy in the great outdoors, North Pines is not the campsite for you.;
, It is a shady site located near a bubbling rapid section of the river and sits in relative isolation from the other sites. It cannot hold an RV.
Other good shady sites on the Merced river include sites 502, 504, 526, 524, 522 and 520.
Sunny sites that are pleasant include sites on the river, such as site 113. Other sunny sites situated on the river but also located near the road, both in and out of the campground, are sites 101, 103 105, 107, 109 and 111.
One delightful spot is site 136. This is a shady, relatively isolated site within view of Tenaya Creek.
 They are the most crowded and do not provide riverfront access.
 Suitable sites include sites 18, 37, 28, 39, 60 and 63. These are great when the weather isn't too hot. Be aware, however, that on a very hot summer's day, the lack of tree cover can make these campsites rather uncomfortable.
 These are located in the back of the campground. As such, they have some relative isolation and avoid the sun. Suggested good sites include 87, 88, 89, 69, 70, 71, 53, 4 and 2.
 However, many of them may be crowded and unappealing if you are seeking more solitude and space.

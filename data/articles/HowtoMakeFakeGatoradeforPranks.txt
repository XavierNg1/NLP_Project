 You will need: An empty Gatorade bottle, water, and lots of different food colouring.;
, It is best to have an already used Gatorade bottle, and the wrapper is essential to the prank going well. Pour the water into the bottle. If you are making "Lemon-Lime" Gatorade, make sure you are using that kind of bottle and wrapper. Add food colouring until it looks just right. Close the lid, shake it up, and make sure it is thoroughly mixed together.
 Don't choose your school's Albert Einstein to pull this on. Someone not stupid, just your average kid. Say, "Hey, I got a Gatorade in the vending machine, and I punched in the wrong number. I don't like this flavour." . If the kid says yes, watch as he/she realizes, it tastes NOTHING like it. If you don't like the results, try again on another kid (just be sure to wash the bottle out)

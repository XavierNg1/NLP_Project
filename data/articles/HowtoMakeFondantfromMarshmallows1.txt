 Marshmallows are extremely sticky, and you'll have a difficult time handling them if you don't use a lot of shortening throughout the fondant-making process. The shortening prevents the marshmallows from sticking to the countertops and the spoon you're using.









Rub shortening all over the spoon, not just the bottom. Cover the handle as well.
Rub shortening on a large cutting board, baking sheet, or whatever work surface you're planning to use when it's time to knead and roll out the fondant dough. This is a messy job, so you'll need a big surface.;
, Use the largest one you have that fits in the microwave. Dump all of the marshmallows into the bowl, then pour the 2 tablespoons of water on top.
 You want to completely melt the marshmallows, but do it slowly so they won't make a mess. Check the marshmallows every 30 seconds to monitor their state, and remove the bowl from the microwave when they're melted.
 Pour half the bag of powdered sugar into the marshmallow mixture, and use the spoon to mix it in. Pour in more powdered sugar and keep stirring. The mixture will become very stiff, and eventually difficult to stir with the spoon. That's when you'll want to stop adding powdered sugar. You may not need the entire bag.

 Your teacher may use further methods to determine your grade in the class. It is important to know which system your teacher or school uses before doing too many calculations. If your class will be graded using standards-based grading, then the methods above should accurately predict your grade.


Standard-based grading is a system where all of your work can earn a set number of points and the number of points you earn directly results in your grade.
 Rank-based grading is a more complicated system that has been adopted by some teachers and schools. In this system, all of the grades earned across all of your classmates will be placed on a curve. The majority of students will receive a middle range grade, whereas students who score higher or lower than the middle group will receive correspondingly high or low scores. Where you placed on the curve will then determine your final grade, so it can complicate your calculations.


For example, you may get an “A” (even if you scored only an 85%) if your classmates all scored worse than you did.
This system can be used to determine your entire grade or just particular parts. Sometimes teachers will apply it only to a final exam, for example.

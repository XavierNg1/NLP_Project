 Ensure your math and calculations are correct.


Your total rise is the vertical height from one story to the next. Your individual rise is the vertical height of each step.
Your total run is the horizontal distance between one story and the next. The individual run is the horizontal distance of each step.;
, The board should be at least 12 inches (30.48cm) longer than the planned stairs.
 These figures should touch the upper edge of your board.


The short end of the square (tongue) should be on the rise measurement. The long end of the square (body) should be on the run measurement.
 Move the square down to extend the run line to the lower board edge.
 This marks the stringer bottom.



Line up the scale's rise figure at the top edge. Mark the new outline and repeat until you have marked 1 extra pair of runs and rises.
 Do not cut beyond the cut lines, because this can weaken your structure. Finish your cuts with a hand saw.
 Use this one as a stringer template for all of your other stringers so they match exactly.

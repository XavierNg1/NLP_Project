 Sequins can be harder to pull off as you age and some people will not feel comfortable wearing a lot of sequins. There are; however, easy ways to add sequins to your outfit in a subtle way. Try wearing a shirt or dress that incorporates some sequins detailing. There are a lot of beautiful pieces available that will have a few sequins sewn into the piece, without being entirely made of sequins.


For example, a blouse with sequins detailing around the neckline.
 You can also add sequins to your outfit by pairing a sequined cardigan, blazer, or bolero with a solid top underneath. This will add some personality to your outfit, while still maintaining a professional appearance. This can be a great look for a business dinner or casual social event.Wear a black or white blouse under the jacket or sweater. This way the undershirt will not compete with the jacket for attention.
 Another great way to wear sequins is by pairing a sequined tank top or short sleeved top with solid jeans or a pencil skirt. This look will continue to be stunning as you age. Similarly, you can pair a high-waisted sequined skirt with a solid blouse. If you are uncomfortable showing too much leg, you can always wear stockings to cover up and still pull off the look.

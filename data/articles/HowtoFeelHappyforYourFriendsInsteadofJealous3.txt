 Incorporate gratitude exercises into your daily routine. For instance, when you wake each day, spend five to nine minutes writing about someone or something that makes you happy. It could be the friend you’re jealous of, a teacher, a vacation you had, or even your dog. Whatever it is that you’re thankful for, write about it.You might also choose to engage in this sort of gratitude exercise before going to bed each night. Everyone has something to be grateful for in their lives. Instead of fixating on the things you do not have, take some time each day to think and create a list of all the things you are grateful for. For every feeling of jealousy that may pop up, put conscious effort into replacing it with a thought of gratitude.
 Jealous thinking is often a defense mechanism. Positive affirmations can reduce your defensiveness and make you more willing to feel happy for your friends instead of jealous.For instance, you might say, “I am a good person and I am possessed of many useful skills.”
Your positive affirmations might also be more general, such as “Today will be a wonderful day.”

, Jealousy is a result of stress, and can cause even more stress. Find a healthy way to cope with your stress by taking up yoga or some other form of exercise. You might also try:Improving your sleep habits. If you get less than eight hours of sleep per night, you are more likely to be stressed and irritable the following day.
Changing your diet. Poor nutrition can multiply stress. Eat mostly fruits and veggies, and avoid processed foods loaded with salt, fat, and sugar. Stick to whole grains (whole wheat bread, brown rice, whole wheat pasta) and avoid refined wheat and grains (white bread, white rice).
Talking to others about your feelings. Even after you’ve admitted that you have feelings of jealousy regarding your friend, you are likely to continue feeling that way for some time. To cope with these feelings, unburden yourself to another friend family member, or counselor.

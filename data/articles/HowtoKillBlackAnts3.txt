 Regularly sweep, mop and vacuum your floors to get rid of all the tiny crumbs that tend to collect there. After each meal, wipe down your table and countertops to remove all remnants of food. Ants are attracted to even the tiniest of spills, so make sure to clean up after yourself regularly to keep them from coming in.
 It's important not to leave food out for more than a little while - otherwise, the ants will sense that it's there and come to get it. If you have an ant problem, you might have to take extra measures to make sure your food is packaged tightly. The following foods should never be left out where the ants can access them:


Maple syrup
Juice
Sugar
Cracker crumbs
Fruit with thin skin, like strawberries

, Is it easy for ants to walk right into your house? You might want to look into sealing your doors and windows so that the ants won't be able to come inside. Use caulk and door seals to take care of the crack under your door and along the sides of your windows. Examine your house from the outside, too, to determine if there are any holes or cracks where they might be coming in.

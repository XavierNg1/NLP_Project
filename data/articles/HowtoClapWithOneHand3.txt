 Maintain a relatively relaxed hand position.
 This could be your leg, the program you are holding in your other hand, or something else that is near you.


Try to have this surface chosen before the need to clap arises. This will help you clap smoothly instead of appearing frantic as you find something to use.
Donâ€™t use anything that will disturb another person, such as a shared armrest that might shake their chair.
 It should be hard enough to create noise, but not hard enough to break anything or hurt (if the second surface is your thigh.)

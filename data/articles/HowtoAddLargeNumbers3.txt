To add two numbers together using this method, round each number individually. For example, when adding 39 and 97, round the 39 up to 40 by adding 1, and round the 97 up to 100 by adding 3. Now your math problem is 40 + 100, which is easily added to result in 140.
Find your final sum by adding together the two single digits that you've added to each number, and subtracting it from your initial sum. In the example above, you've added 1 (to 39) and 3 (to 97). Now add 1 + 3, resulting in the answer 4.
Next, subtract this second number from your first sum. In this case, you'll subtract 4 from 140. 140 - 4 = 137. This is your final sum.
 You will still round each number individually, but you may choose to round them to a larger unit.


The goal of rounding numbers is to make the addition simple. Sometimes you may wish to round more than once. For example, when adding 982 + 247 + 475, start by rounding 982 to 990 (+8), 247 to 250 (+3), and 475 to 480 (+5). Now your math problem reads: 990 + 250 + 480.
You can employ the rounding method a second time, by rounding 990 up by 10 to 1000, and 480 up by 20 to 500. Now your addition problem reads 1000 + 250 + 500. The total is 1750.
Next, add the numbers you've added to round up. Start with the first numbers you added: 8 + 3 + 5. This total is 16. Because you rounded a second time, add these numbers as well: 10 + 20. This total is 30. Finish by adding all totals together. In this case, you'll add 16 + 30 to result in the number 46.
Finish by subtracting 46 from 1750. The resulting, final sum is 1704.
 You probably use this form of adding large numbers already, perhaps without knowing it.


Notice how often prices are listed in numbers that can easily be rounded up to the nearest dollar. For example, frequently a price is listed as $9.95 which is easily rounded to $10.00. Prices are also often rounded to the nearest half-dollar, as $3.49 is commonly rounded to $3.50.
To pay for a series of items, you'll need to follow the steps of rounding up individually, then adding to see the total. For example, a grocery list of items might contain a gallon of milk for $3.98 (rounded to $4.00), a box of cereal for $4.38 (rounded to 4.50), two pounds of bananas for $1.97 (rounded to $2.00) and a loaf of bread for $3.47 (rounded to $3.50).
Added together, this total grocery bill would be rounded up to $14.00. You have added a total of 20-cents, or $.20, which should be subtracted for your total (pretax!) purchase price of $13.80.

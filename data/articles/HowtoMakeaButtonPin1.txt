 You will need to buy snap-in button casing. You can find this online or at your local craft store. It comes in a variety of sizes and you can get as many as you need (from 20-200 or more!).;
, Print and cut out the image that you want on your button. Make sure the image you have is the right size for the button casing and then print it out on regular paper. Cut out the images as perfectly as you can.
 Put the printed and cut-out image into the bowl half of the casing. Face the image toward the bottom of the bowl.
 Snap in the back of the casing and thatâ€™s it! It's just that easy!

, Simply pull the button apart in order to reset the image or add a new one.

 Measure the correct amount of butter for use in your recipe, using the markings on the packaging or a kitchen scales. Place the remaining butter back in the refrigerator.
 You can leave the butter in its wrapper if it's made from paper, but if it's in metal packaging, you should remove it.
 Alternatively you can use the "Soft/Melt" feature on your microwave, if it has one.
 If the butter yields to your touch, leaving the imprint of your finger, it is soft enough. If not, return to the microwave for another five second burst, and repeat until the butter is soft enough.
 Microwaving should really be your last resort when it comes to softening butter. This is because it is very easy for butter to melt in the microwave, and melted butter produces a very different effect from softened butter when used in a recipe. Melted butter will cause your cookies to spread and make your cakes too dense. Therefore, if you are using a microwave, keep a very close eye on your butter to make sure it doesn't melt.

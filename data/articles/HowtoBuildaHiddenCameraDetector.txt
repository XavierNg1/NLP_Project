Cut the other piece of red plastic about an inch larger than the inner core of the toilet paper roll.
 Attach the smaller piece of cut red plastic to the flashlight, as shown here. Then re-assemble.
 Make 1/2" (12.7 mm) slits around the edge of the larger piece of red plastic.

Cut the toilet-roll in two, and make two 1" (2.5 cm) slits in it, as illustrated.






Tape red plastic and put the other half of the toilet-roll over it. Tape the two halves together.
 You may want to use a better kind of tube if you want to use the detector more than once or keep it in a bag/purse.
 Any camera lens will light up as the flashlight shines on it. This is illustrated with the hidden camera in the video (a gum pack type camera). It works best if you turn off the light and draw the curtains.

 You will want the rod to equal the length, plus several inches beyond the span of your window. Exact length depends on the room and your taste, but be sure you leave enough room on each side so the rod balances easily within the brackets.


Make sure the branches/rod holders are the same length. This will provide more balance and continuity. Keep in mind the “v” area where the branches meet should be situated close to the top of the window molding and will hold the rod in place.






Mark where you plan to cut with your Sharpie marker and then cut along the lines with a saw.





;
, In a well-ventilated area, use a paintbrush to cover the branches with polyurethane. This will keep the branches sealed and protected from peeling or flaking.


Allow branches to dry overnight in a cool, dry room.
 For best results, measure the molding to determine exactly where the brackets will be placed and to ensure they are level and equal.


Drill screws directly through branch brackets and into the molding. Use 2 screws per branch bracket, one toward the “v” and the other toward the bottom of the branch.
 You may want to test how it will look before you add curtain panels or just slip the panel loops through the branch rod and hang.


Hang your curtain.

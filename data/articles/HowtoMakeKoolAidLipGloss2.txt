 Put 2 tablespoons (29.6Â ml) of coconut oil in a small, microwave-safe bowl or cup. Stick it in the microwave. It will only take a few seconds to heat up and soften. Start with 5 seconds.You don't want the coconut oil as a liquid. You just want it to be softer.
If it's too solid to stir, heat it a little more.
If you're making a bigger batch, you can start with 1 cup of coconut oil.
 In a different small cup, pour in 1/2 a packet of Kool-Aid. You can use whatever kind you want. You just need to keep the color and flavor in mind. Add a bit of water. You don't need too much, just a little bit. Stir until it forms a thick paste.Make sure you get as much of the Kool-Aid dissolved as possible.
If it's not dissolving, add a little more water.
 Add a teaspoon of sugar to the Kool-Aid paste. Stir it in until the sugar dissolves. You may need to add a touch more water to help the sugar dissolve. The sugar takes away some of the bitterness, though you can use a sweetener instead., Bit by bit, add the Kool-Aid paste into the coconut oil. Keep adding until you get a color you like. Keep in mind that the color you see in the lip balm will be much lighter on your lips, so you may want to go a little darker than you'd think., Once you've got the desired color, spoon the lip gloss into little containers. You can find small twist-off containers at a drugstore or big box store in the travel toiletries section or at your local craft store.,

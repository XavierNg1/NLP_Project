 You may want to have your Pokémon have the features of a single class of Pokémon, such as an electric Pokémon that combines the features of Pikachu and Voltorb. You may instead want to have a Pokémon that crosses types, such as a miniature version of Gamera that combines Charizard's flame with Blastoise's jet appendages.


Even if you want to create a sprite to fit into a single Pokémon class, you may want to borrow from Pokémon of several classes to create your sprite. If you want to create an electric Pokémon with a body like Voltorb's, you may want to give it a shock aura that looks similar to Gasly's gaseous aura or projections resembling Bulbasaur's whip-like tendrils.;
, Also called sprite programs, these programs/websites are sources of raster images of existing Pokémon that you can combine to make your own creatures. Examples of such generator websites include http://randompokemon.com/, and http://www.dragonflycave.com/testing.htm.
 Instead of using a Pokeball, you'll use the screen capture commands for your computer system or the graphic editor program you'll be using. You'll need a Pokémon for the principal body type, and one or more additional Pokémon for arms, legs, and other appendages.
 Place the captured images close together to make it easier to move image portions from one Pokémon to another.


You may also wish to save your selection of images, so that if you make a mistake, you don't have to recapture the images when starting over.
Some images will display a black background when copied onto the canvas of your graphic editor program. For those images, you'll need to erase or repaint the background to match the canvas, or use the option to make the background transparent when pasted if such an option is available.

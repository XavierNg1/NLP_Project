 Individuals with pink or blue undertones have “cool” toned skin, while individuals with yellow or peach undertones have “warm” toned skin. Olive skin falls between warm and cool, since it is a mix of both yellow and blue undertones.
 Determining the warmth or coolness of your eye color can get tricky, since the spectrum of possible eye colors covers such a wide range.


If you have blue eyes, determine how close they are to pale blue-gray. Most blue eyes are considered cool, but the closer they are to gray, the warmer they get. Another option is to go with a peach or orange color which will make your eye color pop.
If you have brown eyes, determine how close they are to black. Most brown eyes are considered warm, but extremely dark browns often qualify as cool toned.
If you have green eyes, determine whether your eyes are blue-green or yellow-green. Blue-green shades are cool toned, while yellow-green shades are warm.
 Cool tones include strawberry blond, platinum, blue-black, white, auburn, salt-and-pepper, and ash brown. Warm tones include golden blond, brownish black, brown-gold, carrot, or dusty gray.
 If you have more warm tones, then you likely have warm coloring. If you have more cold tones, you likely have cool coloring.



Think gold, copper, camel, khaki, peach, orange, coral, off-white, fire-engine red, and blond tortoise if you have warm coloring.
Lean toward silver, black, rose-brown, blue-gray, plum, magenta, pink, jade, blue, and dark tortoise if you have cool coloring.

 When you see poor person or a homeless people walking the streets or in the countryside, remember they are no different from you. Their economic position is different, their problems may be of a more severe degree, but they are a human being.;
, Go to a shelter and volunteer. Get to know them. Get to understand where they come from. Understanding more about how people's situations can change, for example being made redundant, having their home repossessed, having more children than they can afford to look after etc makes people poor, and or homeless will hopefully help you to treat everyone with respect.
 Be aware that as with any other group of people, not all poor people will repay your kindness and understanding. Some are drug addicts, career criminals, dossers and economic migrants.
 Don't talk to them, let them talk to you. Strive to understand poor people. The biggest thing that insults poor people, and other groups such as disabled people, or people who have differences is to be ignored, taken for granted, or, worse, stigmatized.
 Get to know the people they know. As much as you can, immerse yourself in their lives. Then toddlers home to you warm, cosy, three-bed semi.
 That's a step. A handout gets one past the next meal, but doesn't change the big picture. If you want to help, offer a place to live, a job, or a ride.

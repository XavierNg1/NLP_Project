 Look at your weapons and armor in your inventory, and decide if you have something that you would like to improve. Improvements will give weapons and armor special traits, and make them better in every aspect.

Besides the weapon/armor in question, you will also need special items such as homing stones, dwarven oil, grain solvent, and tempering alloy. You can get these items by deconstructing items at any Blacksmithing Station. Try to get as many of the items as you need for the improvement.
 The Blacksmithing Station is a huge black anvil. Walk up to it., When you walk up to it, the Blacksmithing Station button will appear. Hit A to open the menu., The fourth option down reads “Improvement.” Scroll down and hit the A button to open up the Improvement menu., Pick a weapon or armor from the list by moving along your items until the one you want to improve is highlighted. Select the item, and a new menu will open., Look at the box on the left side of the screen; this box tells you how many items, like Homing Stones, you need for an improvement. One is 20% success rate, two is 40%, and so on. The best you can do is 5, at 100%., Once you’ve added the items for improvement, hit A to improve your item. You will then get a better item and blacksmithing experience.

Always be careful when adding an improvement below 100 percent. If improvement fails, your improvement items as well as the weapon or armor will be destroyed.

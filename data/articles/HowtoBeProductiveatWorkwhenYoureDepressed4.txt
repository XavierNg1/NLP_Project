 Clutter is a nuisance because it makes it harder for you to work. In addition, it can also contribute to your depression. On your good days, try to keep your work area uncluttered so that on your bad days, having too much stuff around won't bring you down even further., If you're depressed, you may also be feeling some anxiety about not being able to get your work done. That anxiety isn't going to help the situation. Try keeping yourself calm by listening to some music that soothes you, if your boss allows it. Of course, put in some headphones so you don't disturb your neighbors, particularly if you are in a cubicle or out in the open., Blue can be a calming color, keeping you relaxed. It can also help increase your productivity. Try adding some splashes of blue to your desk or work space or changing your computer background to a predominantly blue picture.If you can't change much, try adding a touch of color, such as a tiny stuffed animal or sticker where customers can't see it.
 If you can, add some pictures or art to your workspace that make you feel happier. Put up pictures of your kids if that's your thing, or have a desk calendar with cat pictures. You could also put up prints of artwork you enjoy.

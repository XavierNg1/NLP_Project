 You don’t want to use the same makeup remover on your eyes as you do on your face, because the skin around your eyes is very sensitive. Avoid foaming cleansers in particular, because they can easily get into your eyes and you'll likely have to scrub to get your makeup off., Micellar water is a type of cleanser that uses water mixed with minerals that attract dirt. It won’t foam up while you’re using it, but the chemical composition of micellar water will attract dirt. However, you might have to wipe two or three times to get all of your waterproof makeup off., Since eye makeup – especially mascara and eyeliner – tends to be waterproof, using a water-based makeup remover won’t always work best. Instead, try an oil-based makeup remover that will dissolve your makeup more quickly. This is also the best type of remover if you’re in a hurry since you’ll really only need one wipe., Avoid scrubbing your eyelids or lashes and touching the very sensitive area under your eyes. Instead, apply a small amount of your chosen makeup remover to a cotton pad or cotton ball, and hold it over your lashes and eyelid for a minute or two before gently wiping the makeup away.

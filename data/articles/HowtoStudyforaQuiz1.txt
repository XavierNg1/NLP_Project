 Create flash cards by hand or online. Whatever method you use, however, make sure that you create your own flash cards. Creating your own flash cards creates neural pathways. These neural pathways will help you retrieve the important information you learned at a later date.Make your flash cards by writing down key concepts and ideas on one side, and the answers on the other side.
Mix pictures with words on your flash cards.
Study your flash cards in small 15 to 20-minute sessions.;
, Acronyms and mnemonic devices are a great way to memorize difficult information. String together words to make a memorable phrase or sentence. Each word in the phrase should start with the letter of the piece of information you are trying to remember.For example, the phrase “Never eat shredded wheat” is used by students to remember the order north, east, south, and west appear on a compass.
 Test your knowledge by reviewing the practice quizzes at the end of each chapter of your textbook. Review the information that you got wrong on the practice quizzes. Re-take the practice quizzes until you get every answer correctIf your textbook doesn’t provide practice quizzes, then create your own. Create open-ended questions based off of your notes and the textbook. Open-ended questions will force you to write out your answers, which will help you retrieve and apply your knowledge during the quiz.
Alternatively, have a friend create a practice quiz for you.

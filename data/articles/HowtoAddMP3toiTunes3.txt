 You can rip the music from your audio CDs directly into iTunes, allowing you to create a digital copy of your entire physical music collection.
 Insert the CD into your computer's disc drive. Virtually any disc drive will work, as long as it can read CDs.
 iTunes will automatically look up the information for the CD you insert, but sometimes multiple entries will come up for the same disc. If you're prompted to, select the entry that best matches the disc you inserted.


If you inserted a disc that was burned elsewhere, iTunes may not be able to retrieve the information for it and you'll have to fill it out manually.
 If you haven't disabled this setting, you'll be prompted to import the disc once it's been detected. Click "Yes" to begin ripping the audio files to your computer.
 If you didn't get asked to import the disc after it was detected, click the disc button at the top of the iTunes window and then click the "Import CD" button. Click "OK" in the window that appears.


If you specifically want MP3 files, select "MP3 Encoder" from the "Import Using" menu. The default AAC format will result in smaller, higher-quality files than MP3 that are completely compatible with iTunes.
 The progress is displayed at the top of the iTunes window.
 This button has a music symbol icon and can be found in the upper-left corner of the iTunes window. Your new tracks can be found in your library based on the artist information. You can also click the "Playlists" tab and select "Recently Added" on the left side of the screen.

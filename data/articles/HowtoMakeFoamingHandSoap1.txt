 Plastic and glass bottles can be acquired cheaply in most supermarket and online. If you want to make a good gesture for the environment or save money, you can clean and recycle an old bottle with dispenser instead of buying a new one.


Choose a sturdy and aesthetically pleasing bottle. Remember that you want to use it for a long period of time.
If possible, test a few bottles. Make sure that the pump works well and look for a sturdy bottle which can survive a fall on the floor.;
, Washing your hands can damage the skin. If you suffer from hand dryness, irritation, itching or cracks, look for hypoallergenic or scent-free soap. Examine the label. The most common allergic reactions are caused by the following ingredients: QAC, iodine, iodophors, chlorhexidine, triclosan, chloroxylenol and alcohols. Look for a soap with moisturizer to protect the skin of your hands.
 Pour tap water into your empty hand soap bottle until it is one third of the way full and then add the gel soap refill until another third of the space is filled. Shake well to mix the gel and the water until they form a liquid. Tighten the pump back onto the hand soap bottle.


Add the water first. If you don't, the water will make the soap foam up.
Do not fill the bottle beyond two thirds of the way. If you do, the bottle will overflow when you screw the cap back on.
If the dispenser pump is not springing back to the up position, rub a bit of petroleum jelly on the dispenser stem to get it freely moving again.
The mixture must be diluted enough to flow through the pump. If the dispenser is clogged, clean it and add more water to the mixture.

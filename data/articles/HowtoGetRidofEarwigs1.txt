 Place shallow tin cans (like cat food cans) in your yard. Fill them with 1/2" (1.25 cm) of vegetable oil. This will attract the earwigs, they'll crawl in and drown. Dump and refill the cans as needed.;
, Roll up an old newspaper and place it near the base of your plants around sunset. (Alternatively, you can cut up sections of an old garden hose.) Empty these earwig traps into a bucket of water every morning, or place the inhabitants a long, long way from your garden bed and house.
 Poke some entry holes in the outer sides of a shoebox near the base. Place a thin layer of oatmeal or bran in the box and put the lid on it. Leave it on the porch or other entrance area around or in your home to trap the earwigs.

 Encourage your child to express their thoughts and feelings. This shows that your child’s thoughts and feelings are valuable. Your child may not immediately offer up information, so ask questions. Say, “What do you think about going to preschool?” or say, “You’re starting preschool tomorrow. How does your body feel?”Give them a vocabulary to use to label feelings by naming them for them. Say, “You look disappointed that you didn’t get a star today. What happened?”You can also say, “Wow, I can tell you had a good day today, you look very happy!” This will help them talk about their own feelings and express them to you., Have something you do with your child each time you leave them at preschool. This could be a special hug or high-five and a phrase such as “See you later, alligator! After a while, crocodile.” Be consistent and make a point to say goodbye. The ritual can comfort your child and make them feel special.Resist the urge to run back and rescue your child if you hear them crying or screaming. Going back for your child sends the message that they are safe only if you are there. This can prolong their distress. Trust the teacher’s years of experience to calm your child.
 Some children may have an especially hard time separating from you when they go to school. If this is the first long stretch of time your child has spent away from you, don’t be surprised if they struggle with separation anxiety. However, plan to combat it before it starts. If your child expresses concern (either before or after preschool starts), listen and make them feel heard and understood. Let them know it’s normal to feel happy, sad, angry, scared, and nervous.Reassure them that they will be safe and that you will come back for them.
Also, make sure to be consistent about the time when you take them to school. If they start off later than other children or at different times throughout the week, then this may throw off their day.

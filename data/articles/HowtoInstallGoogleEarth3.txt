 Google Earth is available for free for both Android and iOS devices. You can use Google Earth on both phone's and tablets.


You can also find links directly to the app in the store by visiting the Google Earth website on your phone, selecting "Mobile", and then clicking the appropriate link for your device.
 Make sure that you are downloading the free app published by Google Inc.
 On Android, tap the Install button to begin downloading the app. On iOS devices, tap the Free button, and then tap the Install button that appears. You may need to enter your account password.


If you have a data cap on your service, you may want to download the app while on a Wi-Fi connection.
 Once installed, the app should appear on your Home screen or in your App Drawer. Tap the apps icon to open it, and start using Google Earth. It is recommended that you go through the quick tutorial first to get a hang of using your fingers to navigate the globe.


By default, Google Earth will start zoomed in at your location as determined by your device's GPS and Wi-Fi connection.

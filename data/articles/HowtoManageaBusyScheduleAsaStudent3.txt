 Establishing goals for yourself is an important part of using your time wisely. Though you are likely working towards more comprehensive accomplishments, specific goals are more helpful for study sessions.Avoid vague, immeasurable goals such as “Read for philosophy class.” Instead, give yourself the goal of reading 15 pages or Sartre and writing a few paragraphs about the test. Similarly, instead of “study for biology exam,” establish the goal to “complete two of chapter three’s worksheets.”

, In order to be achievable, your goals should take a short, realistic amount of time to reach. Establishing the goal of studying for 28 hours next week doesn’t actually help you study for 30 hours next. However, deciding to study 4 hours every day next week can help compel you to reach 28 hours of studying!, You’re already planning on starting a paper tomorrow and it’s already late. However, an idea occurs to you. Take advantage of moments such as these by sitting down to record your thoughts. You don’t necessarily need to start writing, but you can get a head start on tomorrow’s tasks by reading the paper’s prompt and nailing down your specific topic., Break up any study session longer than 90 minutes. In fact, plan to study for only 45-90 minutes at a time, with 10-15 minutes breaks in between focused sessions.Try to establish a schedule that incorporates 3 total hours of studying each day, broken into multiple study sessions.
If possible, study during the day, as opposed to the evening, as your mind will be able to focus better and your memory will retain more.
 Once a month, spend a few minutes reflecting on your long-term goals. Are the ways you’re spending your time contributing to the achievement of those goals? If not, look for ways to tweak your schedule and behavior to ensure you’re on track to meet your goals both short and long term.

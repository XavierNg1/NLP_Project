 Burmillas can have short or long hair. Both hair types are easy to take care of. Make sure you brush or comb your Burmilla’s hair at least once each week. This helps to remove mats or tangles in the fur. The breed also sheds a lot, so weekly brushing will remove dead hair.It also helps spread skin oils over the coat to keep it healthy.
 You should regularly groom your cat, which includes trimming their nails and cleaning their ears.To clean their ears, use a liquid ear cleaner and a cotton ball. Do this once each week.
To trim your cat’s nails, place your cat in comfortable position. Only clip the nail and not the quick. Place your cat on your lap. Use your dominant arm to hold your cat’s upper body in place. With your other hand, hold the paw. Gently press the paw to make the claws pop out. Trim the nails with your other hand. You can take your cat to the vet for a nail trim if you cannot do it yourself.
 Proper teeth cleaning is part of taking care of your cat. Brush the cat’s teeth with a cat toothpaste and cat toothbrush. To get your cat used to brushing, start by letting them get used to the taste. Put the toothpaste on your finger and let them taste it. When your cat gets used to the taste, rub your finger along the gums to get them used to the sensation.


After they have gotten used to that, place toothpaste on a toothbrush. Carefully drag the toothbrush along the cat's gums. Over a few days, move the toothbrush along the teeth in small circles. Keep adding more teeth until your cat will let you brush all of their teeth.
Never use human toothpaste on a cat. The fluoride is toxic to cats.
Take your cat to the vet for oral exams and dental cleanings at least once a year.

 Rule 8.204 of the California Appellate Rules allows you to use any conventional type-space as long as the size is at least 13 point. I did a little research and discovered the Times Roman font family was designed for newspapers, not books. The letters are very close together. Some people go the opposite extreme with Courier.
 The Century Type Font family is used by the United State Supreme Court and they require briefs in this font as well. Century Schoolbook is also the favorite font of Circuit Judge Richard Posner. The font may look a little weird at first, but it reads very well.
 So I go with 12-point size even though it is technically a violation of the California Appellate Rules of Court (don't tell anyone).

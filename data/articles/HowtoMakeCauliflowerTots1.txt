 Wash 1 head of cauliflower and trim away the leaves. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut the cauliflower into florets. Put the florets in a microwave-safe bowl with 2 tablespoons of water. Microwave the cauliflower for 6 minutes, so that it steams and becomes soft.If you prefer, you can use a steamer basket to steam the cauliflower on the stove.;
, Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (175 C). Scoop the steamed cauliflower into a food processor along with any water that's left in the bowl. Put the lid on the processor and blitz the cauliflower until it's completely smooth.You may need to stir the cauliflower and blitz it again to ensure there aren't any chunks of cauliflower in the puree.
 Scoop the pureed cauliflower into a mixing bowl and add 1/4 cup (12 g) of nutritional yeast. Stir in 2 tablespoons of flour and some salt and pepper. Taste the mixture and add more salt or pepper according to your preferences.You can also use coconut or almond flour instead of all-purpose flour.
Consider adding some of your favorite spices. For example, you could try curry, cumin, paprika, or turmeric.
 Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and set it on your work space. Use a spoon or cookie scoop to scoop out teaspoon-sized balls of the cauliflower mixture. Set the balls on the baking sheet.If the mixture is too wet, add a little extra flour to thicken it up.
 Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the tots for 35 to 40 minutes. They should turn golden brown. You can then turn on the broiler and place the tots under it. Broil the tots for 1 to 2 minutes, so they be become crisp on the outside.You should serve these immediately because they'll soften as they sit out.

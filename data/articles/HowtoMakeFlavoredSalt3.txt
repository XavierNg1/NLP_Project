 Certain liquids can be cooked down to then be combined with salt like wet condiments. Wines and heavy liquors are especially good for this purpose due to their sugar content and high smoke point. Grab a bottle of your favorite pinot noir or barrel-aged whiskey and get cooking.Browse a few recipes to see which liquids can be used to make reductions and which can’t.
Try a dash of maple-bourbon salt on a sirloin steak or homemade caramels.
 Pour 2-3 cups of your chosen liquid into a saucepan. Turn on the stove top to a medium-high temperature and heat the liquid until it just begins to bubble. From there, reduce the heat and let it continue simmering.The liquid will most likely need to simmer for between 15-20 minutes, but exact times may vary. Keep an eye on it as it cooks down.
 The process of boiling and simmering the liquid will cook the moisture out of it, causing it to thicken into a condensed syrup. Stir the reduction continuously to keep air moving through it and prevent it from burning or sticking to the saucepan. When it’s thick enough to coat the outside of your spoon or ladle, it’s ready to be added to the salt.You should be left with 1–2 tablespoons (14.8–29.6 ml) of syrup after the liquid is fully reduced.Remove the reduction from the heat as soon as it’s finished. It can burn very easily if it continues being exposed to heat after it has thickened.
 Drain the contents of the saucepan onto a nonstick baking sheet. Pour in 1-1 ½ cups of salt and fold the salt into the syrup by hand. Spread the salt mixture thin and place the baking sheet in the oven for about 2 hours at 170 °F (76.7 °C). The dried salt can then be broken up and sifted into a different container. That’s all it takes!Shake or stir the salt periodically to keep it separated.
You can produce roughly 1 cup of salt per batch this way.

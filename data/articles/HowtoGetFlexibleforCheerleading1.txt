 Work on your warm-up routine once in the morning and once in the evening every day.;
, Stretching cold muscles can cause more harm than good.
 Example Routine... Hold each stretch anywhere from 30 seconds - 1 min. Don't stretch too long, because you might injure yourself. Do a pike, straddle(left, right, center), butter fly, bridge (make sure to push through your shoulders), Splits (left, Right, Center)... If you have your split to the ground then its time for you to put your front foot up on a higher level. If you're tumbling always stretch your wrists and ankles as well.

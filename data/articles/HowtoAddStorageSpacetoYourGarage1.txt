 Go through the things in your garage and organize them according to function or utility. As you sort, you should also create three other piles for things that you want to recycle, throw away, or donate. Once you have sorted everything and removed the things you want to get rid of, you should have a better idea of what your needs are going to be.Be sure to responsibly dispose of any chemicals or other hazardous chemicals in your garage. Do not simply throw them in the trash or pour them the drain. Contact your local hazardous waste site about disposing of excess chemicals.;
, When sorting the things in your garage, determine what items will be stored together. Keeping similar things together will make it easier for you to find them later. It will also help you determine what kind of storage system to invest in.For example, put all of your gardening supplies in one group and your sports gear in another.
 Once you sort everything, make a floor plan of your garage. With a tape measure, note the measurements of the garage, paying particular attention to the windows, doors, and any utilities. You should also figure out how much space you will need for your car. After you make your measurements, plot out the dimensions of your garage on grid paper and highlight the areas where you can store things., Using your floor plan, consider the types of storage space you will want to add and the space requirements of each item. Some shelving and vertical storage space systems will allow you to maximize your wall space without giving up much floor room. Things like plastic bins and cabinets will take up more space, but they are useful for storing things long term.Remember to keep garden tools, bikes, and other frequently used outdoor gear near the garage door.
Make sure that the trash and recycling are easily accessible from the door to the house.
Keep your seasonal items in the hardest to reach places, like the top of a shelf.

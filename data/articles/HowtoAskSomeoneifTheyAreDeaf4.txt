 In this scenario, the medium is not the message. If you’re struggling to be convey yourself effectively, or if the person with whom you are communicating is unable to hear you or read your lips, break out some writing equipmentFirst, ask if the other person is comfortable with written communication. Do not assume that a deaf person will prefer to write.
You can use a writing utensil and paper, or use a smartphone or computer to exchange written statements.
 After establishing that the other person is comfortable writing out a conversation, state the subject area or ask them to do so. This will help get your both on the same page at the beginning of a conversation.You likely only need to write a few words at a time. Allow the deaf person to see what you’re writing as you write, as they will likely understand what you’re trying to convey before you’ve written it all out.
 You should still try to maintain lots of eye contact and use body language indicating that your focus is on the conversation. For instance, sit or stand with your body facing the other person, and watch their face whenever you are not writing.You will read each other’s facial expressions as much as the content you’ve written. This will make communication more comprehensible, not to mention more accurate.
 If your conversation progresses, the person you are speaking with may want to use software such as Computer-Aided Real-Time Transcription, which will allow them to read what you are saying as you speak.

 Because not all gamers actually buy in-app purchases, publishers often give all players an equal chance in owning items that can only be bought using in-app purchases through raffles and promos.


Most raffles apply to anyone who plays the game though sometimes only a specific group can participate.
Check the mechanics of any in-game raffles or promos of the game you’re playing to see if you’re qualified to join.
 If you don’t want to spend money or time, you can always use cheat engines to easily get free in-app purchases. Cheat engines are applications developed by end-users that are designed to hack games.


Cheat engines can be downloaded either over the Internet or from the application market of the device you’re using. There are several versions you can choose from and some even works only with a specific game.

 Put the carrots into a large saucepan, then cover them with water. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat, then cook the carrots until they turn tender, about 15 minutes.
 Pour the carrots through a strainer, then shake them gently to dislodge any last bits of water. Place the carrots back into the saucepan, then set the saucepan aside.
 Pour the orange juice into a small saucepan, then bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Let it cook for 5 minutes., Don't worry if the ingredients don't come together right away. This will give you a basic glaze. If you'd like to step things up a bit, try some of the following:If you'd like extra flavor, add ½ teaspoon of ground cinnamon and ¼ teaspoon of ground allspice.
If you don't have any brown sugar, try ¼ cup (90 grams) of maple syrup instead.
For a richer glaze, increase the butter to 4 tablespoons (55 grams).
 The butter will melt first, then the sugar will start to dissolve. Eventually, the glaze will start to thicken. If it is not thick enough for you, stir in 2 teaspoons of cornstarch.
 You can stir the carrots up with a rubber spatula, or you can cover the saucepan with a lid and shake it. This will coat the carrots in the glaze.
 They taste great on their own, or as a side for a larger meal. If you are serving this to young children, let the carrots cool down for a few minutes first. It might also be a good idea to cut them into bite-sized pieces as well.

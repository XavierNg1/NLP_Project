 For this recipe, you'll need:

1 cup peanut butter (230g) (or another nut butter, or "Sunbutter")
3 medium bananas (300g) (see nutrition link below, for substitutions)
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt (remember that peanut butter has salt)
1/4 cup virgin coconut oil, melted (can substitute with 1/4 cup extra peanut butter; the texture will just change) (50g)
Stevia extract to taste, or 3-4 tablespoons of powdered sugar, or liquid sweetener (such as pure maple syrup).
(If you want a deeper-dish pie, use: 1 1/2 cup peanut butter, 4 1/2 bananas, 1 tablespoon vanilla, a little over 1/8 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoon coconut oil, and stevia to taste or 5 tablespoons of powdered sugar.)

, A Vita-mix is great for this., This pie can easily be crustless! Freeze until firm. (If not using the coconut oil, just chill in the fridge instead.), The pie should be kept cold, for example, in a freezer. Just thaw before eating, and the mousse-like texture will come right back!

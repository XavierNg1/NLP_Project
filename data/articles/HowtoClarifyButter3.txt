 Melt whatever quantity of butter you wish in a saucepan over low heat. Don't let it get so hot that it browns.
 Remove it from heat and let it sit until the solids gather at the top.
 Use the type of food storage bag that has a zipper seal. Seal the bag, making sure it's locked.
 Two distinct layers will form in the bag; a liquid layer on the bottom, and a solid layer on the top.
 Snip off just enough of one of the bottom corners to make a small hole for the liquid to run through.
 The solids won't be able to pass through the hole.

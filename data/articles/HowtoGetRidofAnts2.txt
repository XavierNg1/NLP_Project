 If you can find the source, carefully dig/puncture the soil and dump several gallons of boiling water into the nest. That should take care of the entire colony.
 Mix one part camphor oil with 9 parts denatured alcohol (ethyl alcohol that has a chemical added to stop humans from enjoying it), may be methylated spirits containing poison non-drinking alcohol. Pour over the anthill., The best way to get rid of ants is to destroy their source: the ant queen. She produces a large number of ants and killing her will exterminate them; if you can, find and kill the queen inside the ant nest. She's rather shy and will hide in the bottom. This method is not recommended, if the ants are aggressive and/or sting.

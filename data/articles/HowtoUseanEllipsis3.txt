 To determine where you want to add an ellipsis in creative or informal writing, you should ask yourself a question: Do you want to add an ellipsis to express passage of time, or do you want it to express an unfinished thought?

, One way to use an ellipsis to indicate a pause is when you want to describe passage of time without words. This ellipsis most often occurs in the middle of a sentence.


Insert the ellipsis between two words where the pause occurs.
The passage of time can be very short, almost instantly, such as with this sentence: “I was um … thinking about you today.”
The passage of time can be much longer, days or weeks, such as with this sentence: “Weeks later … I finally heard from my old boss about the job.”
An ellipsis used to express passage of time can often be substituted for the phrase “and then.”

, When a piece of dialogue or a thought is said to “trail off,” this means it is an unfinished thought. You should use an ellipsis to express an unfinished thought at the end of the sentence.


Insert the ellipsis after the last word to trail off at the end of a sentence.

“I was thinking about you today ...”


If the ellipsis occurs at the end of the sentence and the sentence would normally end with a question mark or exclamation point, place it after the ellipsis.

“Were you thinking about me today...?”

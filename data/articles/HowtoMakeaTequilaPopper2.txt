 There are some resorts in Mexico that serve tequila poppers (sometimes called Tijuana poppers), which are different in that they are poured and served directly in the participant’s mouth, and they often use beer instead of soda.


For Mexican tequila poppers, you will need a bottle of tequila (preferably with a measuring spout on it), as well as a bottle of beer, such as Corona, that’s been opened.
In Mexico, the server will continually blow a whistle while serving this drink.
 This drink can get pretty messy, so it’s a good idea to take a few precautions.Have the participant tilt his or her head back, mouth open.
 To prevent excessive consumption, measure out either a quarter, half, or full ounce directly into the mouth of the participant. Tell the participant not to swallow.
 To get the same fizzy effect as the lemon-lime soda, cover the top of the beer bottle with your thumb or finger and shake the beer.Carefully direct the opening of the bottle into the participant’s mouth and slightly move your thumb to the side to allow a spray of beer into the mouth.


Don’t spray in too much or the participant could choke, and don’t spray it directly down the throat.
Instead of pre-fizzing the beer, some resorts will pour the beer into the participant’s mouth, hold the mouth closed, and then shake the participant’s head to fizz up the beer., Cover it with the towel so the foam doesn’t get everywhere and tell the participant to swallow.

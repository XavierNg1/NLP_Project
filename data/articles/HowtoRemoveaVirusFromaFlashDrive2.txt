 Originally, when you inserted a USB drive into a port, the USB drive automatically opened. If your USB drive was infected, this process executed a file called autorun.inf, which housed the autorun virus. As a result, when the USB drive automatically opened, it would activate the autorun virus. USB devices are no longer opened automatically with Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10, which in turn means that the autorun.inf file is no longer executed automatically. This measure protects your computer from the virus., If you are concerned about the integrity of your pen drive, scan your drive for viruses before use. Click Start > My Computer. Right-click on the removable drive and select “Scan for Viruses.” If a virus is detected, follow the provided instructions to remove it.

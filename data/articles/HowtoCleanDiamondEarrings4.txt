 To remove tarnish from silver, you can also use household products.


Take Â¼ of a cup of baking soda and mix it with 2 tablespoons of water into a thick paste. Take a damp sponge, and rub it on the silver, then rinse it, and dry it.
You can also use baking soda to polish gold by covering the gold with a light coating of it. Then, pour vinegar over it, and rinse it.
You can make gold shine more if you put a little bit of beer on a piece of towel and then rub it over the jewelry. Believe it or not, but you can also put silver in ketchup to make it brighter. Put the jewelry in the ketchup only for a few minutes.

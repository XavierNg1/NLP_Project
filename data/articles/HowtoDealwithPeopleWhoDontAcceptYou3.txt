 If a person suddenly wants to be friends, you might be drawn into it. Be careful of people using you because of your talent, intellectual abilities etc. When friendships of these kinds end (they always do), you'll be more drawn into yourself and more shy and awkward! You'll also hurt your confidence and feelings!


Don't behave like some friend-deprived person! People will want to use you if they are certain that you will do anything for friendship.
 These 'friends' may bleat about it to everyone.


In fact, always avoid telling close secrets to anyone! You never know how things will change.
Avoid sharing passwords with them, for your new friend might hack your account and send your connections rude messages.
 Most of these kind of friendships originate from a desire to use you, and get all the help they want form you, and finally, get rid of you when you start questioning.


See if they always want help from you, but make some excuse when you request a favor from them. These friends see you as a ready made help machine, and want to use you to the fullest potential. Decline requests as politely as you can.
Learn to gently distance friends from you. Ditching bad friends is important sometimes.
 Don't make it obvious, but keep them at arm's length. If it is very noticeable, they will understand and treat you badly.


Lessen your interaction with people, and if these fake friends question you why you are not talking to them, go all dramatic and tell them that you are preparing very hard at the moment, and you are undergoing a lot of stress, and are not finding time to talk. That's why you have to stop talking with everyone.
 It just makes you look like a person who can't keep their emotions in control.


Avoid confronting them about their behavior, as they might turn aggressive. Do your business, even though you are feeling very torn up inside.
Regardless of how they treated you, never give away their secrets to others. Not only is it bad, they might give you away!

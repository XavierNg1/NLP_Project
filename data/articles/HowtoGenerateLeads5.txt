 Read everything you can get your hands on in your industry. Search for online articles using the same search terms your customers might use to find you. Also, read books and longer-form articles. They tend to have good citations, appendices, resource lists, and bibliographies that might inspire some leads.
 You might not be looking for consumers exclusively. With knowledge of your industry, you can also find industry leaders who might provide leads or other businesses that might be complementary to your own: buyers, suppliers, distributors, etc.
 When you’re experienced in your own business sector, you might want to write articles of your own for trade publications. Authorship can put you in front of new audiences. The articles you write are also excellent self-promotion just like your press hits. Promote your authored articles as well in your emails, newsletters, social media, etc.
 Try to build on the leads you find through your thought leadership efforts, particularly if your initial interaction is online. Schedule a meeting or make a phone call. A phone call is a more personal form of communication, and it is not a generic or mass media message. Plus, it shows your potential lead that you and your company are real, and that she’d be doing business with a real person.
 If your company provides the types of goods and services that the government typically buys, try becoming an official government contractor and bidding on contracts. Government applications are especially relevant if your company provides a niche service or offers unique expertise. You will have to fill out a number of forms, but once you’re official, this could open up a huge new avenue of leads. Some companies’ entire business is conducted with governments.

 You are best choosing a newer game, as they have better graphics and improved trading systems should you need to trade your one Pokémon in, as most likely, you will. Recommended games: Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, HeartGold/SoulSilver, Black/White, Black 2/White 2 (due to be released in English in Autumn 2012).;
, You will probably have to trade it in, but if your chosen Pokémon is a starter, or available very early, then you do not have to use the trading function. You can, like many people opt, choose your favourite Pokémon. You could also choose a fairly weak/underrated Pokémon, and try to prove its strength! Make sure you are able to obtain that Pokémon, and it's time to begin!

, Obtain your chosen Pokémon. You may have to wait until after you get the first gym badge to trade a Pokémon in - If so, then choose the easiest starter so you can get through to that point as quick as possible. After that, trade your starter for your chosen Pokémon. Try to get it at level 14-18, as it may not obey you if you have it too high, and the game will not be a challenge.
 When so, catch a very low level Bidoof, Patrat, Rattata, or something similar, so when you're done, you can put it away in a PC box forever (or take it out when you need an HM slave, next double battle when you are required to have two Pokémon, etc.)

, Make note of types, and keep the type match-ups in mind. Your Pokémon may be weak against the gym leader's type. If so, use TMs to teach move that have type advantage.
 Can't beat someone? Keep trying! Teach your Pokémon new moves. Try a different strategy. Train a little more. You'll win eventually. Just don't give up. Start EV training or specific vitamins and other items to boost your stats.
 Use type advantages and skill to overcome the Elite Four. Make sure you have plenty of Hyper Potions, Full Restores, and status healers. You can also give your Pokémon a helpful item to make it easier. If it's getting really tough, you may want to resort to X-items. Don't worry about Revives and Max Revives (Unless you are playing Pokémon Black/White, you'll find out why) - You only have one Pokémon so they're worthless.
 This is the hardest part of the game. It's time to prove yourself! The Champion usually has many types of Pokémon, at high levels, but your Pokémon, as you have only one and have been able to train it more, should be higher, at around level 75-80. Note that if you are playing Pokémon Black/White, the cover legendary Pokémon is required for N and Ghetsis, so Revives and Max Revives are of use. When you've won... Congratulations!

, People will have to believe you, and your Pokémon's awesome power now!

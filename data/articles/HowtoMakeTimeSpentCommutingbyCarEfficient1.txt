 The best way to speed up your commute is to shift your work schedule so that you can avoid peak traffic hours. For instance, if the commute is worst at 7-9am and 4-6pm, you could leave around 6am and come home at 3pm, or leave at 9am and come home after 6pm to miss rush hour., The map function on your phone can suggest alternate routes and show you approximate driving times, taking into account traffic volume and accidents. Checking your route each morning and evening before you set out will allow you to find ways around the worst traffic., Continue changing up your path to work until you hit upon the one that gets you there fastest at the time you commute. Even if the route you choose that day is slower, experiencing new scenery can make your drive more enjoyable., We’ve all been there: you change into a faster moving lane only for it to immediately grind to a halt. Or you stay in your lane and watch car after car pass you in the next lane over. So what should you do? Luckily, scientists have taken away some of the guess work by modeling ideal lane changing strategy.Don’t just stay in your lane. Not only you, but the jam overall will move more quickly if drivers change lanes.
Wait to merge as long as possible. If a road sign warns of lanes merging ahead, don’t get over right away. You’ll speed your commute and actually reduce overall congestion if you wait until the actual merge point to get over.
If the car before you is stopped and there is a space open in the adjacent lane, change lanes. This strategy is optimal for reducing your time in the jam.
Don’t do “fast” lane changes. If a car in the lane next to you is accelerating so that you can squeeze into the gap behind it, you may be tempted to do so. Don’t. Modeling shows that "fast" lane changes will actually increase your time in the traffic jam.

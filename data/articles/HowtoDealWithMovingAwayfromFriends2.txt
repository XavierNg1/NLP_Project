 Texting and instant messaging are great ways to keep in touch informally. A quick “how are you?” can help you communicate even over large distances. If there is a significant time difference between your old and new homes, instant messaging allows your friends to reply when it is convenient for them.Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Snapchat are good apps for staying in touch.Like friends' pictures on social media, and leave comments. This will help open up natural ways of conversation when you are far apart.
 Decide with your friends a good time to chat over video. Make video dates every week or two weeks to stay in touch. Talking face to face will help you when you are missing them. Setting a schedule will make sure that you actually follow through on your communication. Some video chat programs include:Facetime
Skype
Google Hangouts

, If your old friends have birthdays or important anniversaries, you should try to send them a message, even if you have not talked in a while. If you can, send them a card or small present in the mail.
 If you have not moved far away, visiting your old friends may be an option. Make plans to go back to your old town, and inform all of your old friends that you will be there. Invite them to at least one planned activity. This could be a group dinner, a hike, or a barbecue at a friend’s house. Visiting makes your leaving seem like less of a final goodbye.
 If you cannot visit your old town, perhaps you can make plans with your old friends to go somewhere new together. Decide together where you will go. Spending a couple days together doing something new and adventurous will help you continue to make memories.

 Your park needs to be at level 9 or higher.;
, For example, a storm dragon or an ice dragon. Fire and storm seem to be the most compatible for a blue fire dragon outcome.


Obviously, cold and fire are incompatible, hence a hybrid is needed. It is also possible to breed a cold dragon with a fire hybrid dragon to get a blue dragon.
Both dragons should be at least at level 10 to guarantee success.
Placement of the fire dragon first in the cave may affect the outcome positively., Breeding time can be hastened by spending gems.


You'll know the attempt at getting a blue fire dragon has failed if you get a scorch or firefly dragon after 3-5 hours, or a storm dragon after 5 hours (all good dragons nonetheless).
If the breeding continues, you should find a blue fire dragon after 12 hours. The egg is red with snowflakes across it, a nod to the heat and cold that go into making this dragon.
 Wait another 12 hours until it hatches.
 To help it grow, feed it the same food as all baby dragons.

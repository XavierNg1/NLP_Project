 If you notice the stains before it has a chance to dry, you might be more likely to remove it all. Try running your clothing through a regular washing cycle in your washing machine with standard detergent. If the clothing is white, add bleach for extra washing power. New caulk stains or ones that have not completely dried may come off with a normal wash., Wet a rag or a paper towel. Press the towel firmly against the caulk, and let the moisture sink in. Dab the area again and again, and gently rub the stain out of the fabric. Try to blot as much of the caulk as possible off of the garment.
 After you have removed as much excess caulk as you can, wet a piece of folded paper towel with some rubbing alcohol. Blot the stain, firmly, and let the alcohol soak deep into the fabric. Dab the stain as many times as needed to remove the stain.


You may need to reapply several times to remove the stain. Add more alcohol each time.
Always use a clean section of the towel. If the towel becomes overly stained and saturated with caulk, you may need to switch to another rag., Once the stain is removed, launder the garment in cold or warm water. When you remove the garment from the washer, examine the stain to make sure it's completely removed. You may have to wash it a few times to get the stain completely out. Don't place it in a dryer with any stain remaining, since the heat will set it.

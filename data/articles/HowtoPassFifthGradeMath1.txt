 The denominator is the number below the fraction bar. Before, you added and subtracted fractions with like denominators. Now, the denominator will be different, so you have to follow extra steps. For example, if you are adding 12+24{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {2}{4}}}:

Think of the multiples of each denominator.For the first fraction, some multiples of 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.For the second fraction, some multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12.

Find the smallest multiple each denominator has in common. In this case, the smallest multiple is 4.

Rewrite one or both fractions as equivalent fractions, so that they have the same denominator. Use the smallest common multiple. In this case, 4. For the first fraction, 12=24{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}={\frac {2}{4}}}, so you can rewrite the problem as 24+24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}+{\frac {2}{4}}}.

Add the numerators. Keep the common denominator: 24+24=44{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}+{\frac {2}{4}}={\frac {4}{4}}}.
;
, To do this, you first multiply the denominator by the whole number. This becomes your new denominator. Then, you just keep the same numerator.For example, to divide 4÷13{\displaystyle 4\div {\frac {1}{3}}}, you would find 14×3=112{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4\times 3}}={\frac {1}{12}}}.
 You do this the same way you divide by a single digit number, except that instead of dividing into the first digit under the division sign, you divide into the first two digits under the division sign.To remember the steps of long division, use the phrase “Does McDonald’s Sell Cheese Burgers?” This will help you remember to Divide, Multiply, Subtract, Check, and Bring down.For example, to divide 15)3045¯{\displaystyle 15{\overline {)3045}}}, your first step is to divide 15 into 30.Since 30÷15=2{\displaystyle 30\div 15=2}, you would write a 2 above the 0. Next, multiply 15×2=30{\displaystyle 15\times 2=30}.Subtract 30−30=0{\displaystyle 30-30=0}.Bring down the 4.Since you can’t divide 15 into 4, place a 0 above the 4.Multiply 15×0=0{\displaystyle 15\times 0=0}.Subtract 4−0=4{\displaystyle 4-0=4}.Bring down the 5.Divide 45÷15=3{\displaystyle 45\div 15=3}. Write the 3 above the 5.Multiply 15×3=45{\displaystyle 15\times 3=45}.Subtract 45−45=0{\displaystyle 45-45=0}. So, 3045÷15=203{\displaystyle 3045\div 15=203}, with no remainder.
 You do this the same way you add and subtract whole numbers. The difference is that you have to make sure that the decimal points are lined up on top of each other. You also have to add extra zeros if one number has more digits than the other. Finally, remember to drop the decimal point down into your answer, so that it lines up with the decimal points in the number you were adding or subtracting.For example, to add 10.25+8.5{\displaystyle 10.25+8.5} rewrite the numbers so that they are on top of each other, with the decimal points lined up.Then, add a 0 to 8.5, so that it becomes 8.50. Next, you can add the number like you normally would. You get 1875.When you drop down the decimal point into your answer, you get 18.75. 


, You do this the same way you multiply whole numbers. While you are multiplying, you can ignore the decimal points. When you are done multiplying, count the number of places behind the decimal point in each factor. Add up the number of places. Then, count that same number from the right in your answer. Put your decimal point in this place.For example, to multiply 3.25×1.75{\displaystyle 3.25\times 1.75}, begin by multiplying 325×175=56875{\displaystyle 325\times 175=56875}. Then, since there are 2 places behind the decimal point in 3.25, and 2 places behind the decimal point in 1.75, you would count 4 places from the right in your answer. So 56875 becomes 5.6875.
 The volume of a shape is the space inside of the shape. Think of a box. The volume would be the space inside the box. To measure the volume, you need to think about the length, width, and height of the shape. The volume of a shape is measured in cubic units. There are two different ways to measure the volume.You can measure the volume of a shape by counting the number of unit cubes that fit inside the shape. For example, if you have a box that is 2 cubes long, 3 cubes wide, and 1 cube high, you can fit one layer of 6 cubes inside of it. This means the volume is 6 cubic units. If the box is 2 cubes high, you can fit 2 layers of 6 cubes inside of it. So that means the volume is 12 cubic units.

You can find the volume of shape by using a formula. A formula is like a recipe that tells you how to find something. The formula for the volume of a cube is volume=length×width×height{\displaystyle {\text{volume}}={\text{length}}\times {\text{width}}\times {\text{height}}}. For the box that is 2 cubes long, 3 cubes wide, and 2 cubes high, you would multiply 2×3×2=12{\displaystyle 2\times 3\times 2=12}. So the volume is 12 cubic units.

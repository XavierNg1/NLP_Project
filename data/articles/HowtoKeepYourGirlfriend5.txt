 Be kind and friendly, instead of an insensitive jerk. Be moral, ethical and trustworthy, not just with your girlfriend, but in your interactions with other people as well. She’ll notice these interactions, and if you’re berating a waiter at a restaurant or shouting at someone on the street, she may reevaluate whether you’re worth her time.
 You might have trouble managing your anger, or you shut people out when you are down. Take the initiative to work on your issues. This might involve making a conscious effort to open up to your girlfriend, or even seeing a counselor to talk about your issues.
 Keep developing and evolving as a person, finding new hobbies or working hard at your career. You can’t remain the same person for your whole life, so make some active choices to grow. How do you want to evolve as a person, and how do you want her to be involved?, Keep yourself in good health by exercising and eating well. You don’t need to become a fitness fiend or suddenly become completely self-involved with your looks, but caring for your own body and making healthy choices will keep you active and ready for anything., Do the things you say you’ll do, and show up when you say you’ll show up. If she can count on you for the little things, she’ll trust that she can count on you for the big things too.

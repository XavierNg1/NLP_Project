 Do you want it to be about your hamster, guinea pigs, rats, or other animal? Brainstorm what videos you want to do.;
,, Cage tours, training videos, how-to's, hauls, and reviews on products are some good videos that every one wants to see. Don't make the videos just about you.
 Compliment them then advertise your channel, just don't make it sound desperate. Something like: "Hi! I love your videos so much! Can you check out my channel and subscribe! I subbed! This rocks" is something good to say.
 The more videos you make, the more views you will get!,

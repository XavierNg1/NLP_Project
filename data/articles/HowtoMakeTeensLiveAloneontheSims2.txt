 You need to have at least one adult but you can have as many teens as you want. The teens must be related to the adult.Â If you want a child to live alone with your teens as well, create a child or two.;
, Make sure you buy a computer in order for the adult to be able to move out; if you don't have enough money, wait for the newspaper guy to come along or use the 'motherlode' cheat.
 When the box comes up, make sure it's only your adult moving out.
 This saves money for the teens and also adds money to the existing family's household funds, which is a bonus if you decide to play them in the future.
 Make sure that the teens have enough money to provide for the family because they cannot get jobs in this stage of life.


Use cheats to get your teens married or have children if you want to, so that you can make a family with your teen sims.

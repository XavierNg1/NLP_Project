 Using an Ethernet cable to connect your Mac directly to your router will increase the stability of an otherwise-unstable Internet connection, and your browsing speed may increase. However, being tethered to your router means you have significantly less mobility with your Mac--and you probably won't be able to use an Ethernet cable in most public places.
 There should be a square port on the back of your router labeled "Internet" (or "LAN" in some cases).


The moral majority of routers have several spare ports.
 Ethernet cables have a plastic box on each end. If you don't have one, you can buy one online for between $5 and $25.
 It doesn't matter which end you use.
 This should be a square opening on the side of your Mac's casing. It may have a <...> symbol above it.
 Your settings should be configured automatically.


Using a local area network (LAN) doesn't require you to enter a password, though your Mac may ask you if you want to trust the source.

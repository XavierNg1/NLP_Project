Collect a harralander herb. Invest in clean harralander for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy harralanders are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time. Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.
Collect a chocolate dust. Get a chocolate bar (either from the Grand Exchange, from a Cooks' Guild respawn, or from different food shops around RuneScape) and use either a knife or pestle and mortar (members) on it.
 This will create a "Harralander Potion (unf)".
 This will create a three dose energy potion.

 It's hard to make the tough life decisions in high school, but going into this field is something that will require eight years of intensive schooling. If you couldn't handle high school classes, college classes will be difficult.;
, That doesn't necessarily mean study the science of it right now. Make sure you know what, if you go into this field, you will be doing on a day-to-day basis. Learn how a naturopathic doctor is a unique type of physician and what that will entail.
 It might seem glamorous to go to an Ivy League school, but with an eight year degree, money can be more important than reputation. That being said, if you want to go to a private school, it is important to plan ahead about how to get in.
 The ACT and SAT might not be accurate representations of your intelligence, but they're what get you into college - and cheaply. Studying for the ACT in high school would be much more worth your time than studying the field you want to go into, no matter how ridiculous that is.
 You don't want to go into college and be that kid who can't pass freshman chemistry. If you take AP Chem and Bio, it will be miserable - possibly torture - but it will be worth it in the long run.
 If your school or community has STEM-centered clubs or activities, those are a great way to both boost your understanding of your future and look good on paper. Naturopathic doctors vary off the beaten path of physicians, but nature and science centered activities both help for it.
 This is important both for paper, again, and so you know what you're getting into. If you wander into a doctor's office right now and say, "What? This is miserable," that's a lot better for your future than if you do so in five or so years.
 High school is important, but you can bomb it and still make it into college with a couple of speed bumps. Right now, mental health is more important than prepping for a major. You have time.

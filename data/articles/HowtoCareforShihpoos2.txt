 Do your research thoroughly in order to find a responsible breeder. Speak to owners of Shihpoos and find out who their dog's breeder was. If you don't know any owners, speak to your vet who may be able to put you in touch with someone who is prepared to help you.Check out the breeder's reputation online.
 Before you buy your dog, call the breeder and ask to visit. Pay attention to the breeder's attitude. They should ask you as many questions as you ask them. A responsible breeder will want to know their puppy is going to a good home., Socialization is crucial to the future character of your Shihpoo. If he is raised in an isolated environment, such as an outdoor kennel, or taken from his mother too early, like in a puppy farm, then he is likely to grow into a dog that has behavioral issues.The breeder should make efforts for as many different people as possible to meet the puppies from around three to four weeks of age, so the young dogs are used to people of different heights, appearances, and tones of voice.
Never buy a puppy from a puppy mill. A puppy mill breeder makes an excuse as to why the mother dog is not available to view. This trade is unethical and immoral, and should not be encouraged by buying these puppies and creating a demand.
 Ask the breeder what tests they voluntarily give their dogs. These tests help identify certain breed specific diseases. Be aware that good breeding stock does not guarantee a healthy puppy, but it goes a long way to reducing the risk of a sickly dog.The genuine breeder will be able to produce certification to backup their claims.
The tests currently available for breeding dogs include tests for renal dysplasia and juvenile renal dysplasia; hip dysplasia; portosystemic shunt; and progressive retinal atrophy.

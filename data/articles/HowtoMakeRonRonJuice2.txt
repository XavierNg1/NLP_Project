 If your blender has a pulse setting, start by using this. Many people assume they should begin at the highest setting, but this will actually make the drink mix slower. Start with the pulse setting to get your ron-ron juice to mix quickly.Keep pulsing the drink until things are beginning to mix smoothly. Fruit should stop getting stuck on the bottom and all the ingredients should be swirling together.
 Once things are blending, increase the speed to low. Blend the juice on low for 20 to 30 seconds. Then, increase the speed to high for an additionalÂ  20 to 30 seconds., When you're done, everything should be mixed together smoothly. You should be left with a smoothie-like mixture. There should be no chunks of fruit remaining your ron-ron juice.

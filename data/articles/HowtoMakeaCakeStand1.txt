If you have an old microwave you aren't using you can use the plate from that, or you can buy one at a local discount or second-hand store.Buy a large decorative candlestick. This will serve as the base for your cake stand.
You will need sandpaper and gorilla glue to secure the base and plate together.
You will need a colored spray paint as well as a glossy clear coat to paint the cake stand.;
, You want your items to be as clean as possible before you make the cake stand.Wash the candlestick and microwave plate in warm, soapy water.
Wipe them dry with a dish towel.
Let them air dry the rest of the way. They must be completely dry before you start putting the cake stand together.

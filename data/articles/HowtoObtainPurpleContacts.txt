 Some contacts, especially the kind that are purchased before an eye exam, can cause damage to your eyes and vision. Do your homework, and don't rush into a purchase simply because the price is low. Also, be wary of prices that seem too good to be true - many internet based companies charge per lens.;
, Even stores like Walmart have areas devoted to optical care and exams. Make it clear that you would like to try out colored contact lenses that will not be used to correct vision. You will usually be given an "in-store" trial. You won't be able to keep the contacts, but it will give you an opportunity to test how they look and feel. If you don't like how they look, ask for a different brand. Don't make your purchase until you are completely satisfied with their look.
 If they are disposable, wear them only as long as recommended to avoid eye infections.
 There are a number of companies that sell colored contacts online and often you can purchase lenses which are less expensive than those found at your optometrists office.

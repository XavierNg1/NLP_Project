 You can get through this! Stressing out about problems with friends won't help you. Be calm, cool, and collected.;
, Think about what you like to do, and join a club or activity that pertains to that. For example, if you like cooking, join a cooking class at the mall, or if you like to read join a book club. Meeting people with the same interests as you will automatically give you an opening to meet new friends.
 Maybe you want to go to college, or get a job, or lose weight. Anything you want to do, make and set that goal and try to reach it. Having something to look forward to will help you take your mind off of things, get to know yourself a little better, and give you a whole bunch of openings to start over, or begin anew with a clean slate.
 "How to Win Friends and Influence People," by Dale Carnegie, is a good start. Try to apply what you learn in your daily life, and record the results.

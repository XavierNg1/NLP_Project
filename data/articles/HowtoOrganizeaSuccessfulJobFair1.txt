Depending on the size of your job fair, it may be important to have one or more people focused on the following areas: marketing, logistics, volunteer/staff for the event, employer contact, signs and graphics, secretarial and administrative duties. It may be helpful to have one or two people overall job fair coordinators.;
, Detail a budget that includes money for the venue and advertising.
 Make a detailed diagram layout of the space and block out areas for company booths, registration tables, concessions and so forth.
 Aim for a mix of companies from a variety of industries that have jobs openings available, so you can cater to a broad segment of job seekers. As you get confirmations, ask if a company has any special equipment needs for the day.
 Place fliers and information at nearby colleges and high schools, and throughout community gathering places like coffee shops, libraries and grocery stores. Consider placing ads in local and regional newspapers, as well as trade journals. Set up media coverage the day of the event, as well.
 The information should include a map and list of companies represented at the fair.
 Consider having an interview room or place away from the other booths that employers can use for on-the-spot interviews.

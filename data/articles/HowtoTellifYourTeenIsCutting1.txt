 Teens who cut are often depressed, anxious, or under a lot of stress. If your child’s mood or self-esteem has taken a turn for the worse, it doesn’t necessarily mean they are cutting, but it does mean you should be on the lookout for other signs of a problem.For example, if your child seems more withdrawn than usual, doesn’t seem to enjoy doing many things, or says they feel overwhelmed, they might be at risk for cutting. They may also appear depressed, sad, or blue and seem to lack energy to do anything.;
, Everyone gets cuts and scrapes now and then, but if your teen seems to get hurt frequently, or if their injuries never seem to heal, they may be cutting themselves. They may also make a lot of excuses about where the marks came from.For instance, they might say something like, “My arms got scratched hiking in the woods” or “My friend’s cat scratched me.”
Marks that look intentional, such as rows of parallel scratches, are typically a sure sign that your teen is cutting.
Keep an eye out for bloody tissues or bandages in the trash as well.
 All kinds of things can be used to cut or scrape the skin – knives, razor blades, safety pins, paper clips, and even fingernails.

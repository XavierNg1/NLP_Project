 Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Non-stick cooking spray will also work.;
, Ideally, the shelled walnuts will be divided into halves or quarters. Whole walnuts may not toast evenly, while pieces smaller than quarters may toast too quickly and burn as a result. The walnuts should be in a single layer to ensure even cooking.
 At this temperature, the walnuts should only need to bake for 5 to 10 minutes, especially if they are in smaller pieces. Check the walnuts after the first 5 minutes to make sure that they have not started to burn. You can even stir them with a heat-resistant spatula to improve even browning.
 Once the walnuts smell toasted, they are done. Remove them from the oven and transfer them to a heat-resistant bowl until they cool. Enjoy them warm or at room temperature, but you should at least wait until they are no longer burning hot to the touch.

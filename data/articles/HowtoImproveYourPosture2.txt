 How often did your mother tell you that? For many people, this suggestion got filed right next to "eat your peas," or "your eyes will stick that way." Mom was right, though–—at least about your posture. Now, especially, when so many of us sit at a desk all day, it's important to follow these basic guidelines, both for your posture and for your health.









If you work long hours at a desk and have the option, use a chair that's ergonomically designed for proper support and designed for your height and weight. If this is not an option, try using a small pillow for lumbar support.
Align your back with the back of the office chair. This will help you avoid slouching or leaning forward, which you may find yourself doing after sitting too long at your desk.
If you work on computers at an office, position the monitor on an angle a bit more upwards than you would if you were in more of a slouching position. This will force you to sit upright to see the screen better.
As with standing posture, keep your shoulders straight and squared, your head is upright, and your neck, back, and heels are all aligned.
Keep both feet on the ground or footrest (if your legs don't reach all the way to the ground).
Adjust your chair and your position so that your arms are flexed, not straight out. Aim for roughly a 75- to 90-degree angle at the elbows. If they are too straight, you're too far back, and if they are more than 90 degrees, you're either sitting too close, or you're slouching.
 Even if you're using perfect posture while sitting in the best chair in the world (and it's debatable whether there is such a thing), you need to stand up and stretch, walk around, do a little exercise, or just stand there for a few minutes. Your body was not designed to sit all day, and recent studies from the University of Sydney have found that "rolonged sitting is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, independent of physical activity." Keep moving!

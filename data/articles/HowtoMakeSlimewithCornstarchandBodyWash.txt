 You'll need body wash, cornstarch, a spoon, a large bowl, and a container (such as a sealable plastic tub). Optionally, you can also get water and food coloring.;
, In your bowl, put in as much body wash as you want, depending on how much slime you want to make.
 You may have to add more, depending on how much body wash you put in. Then, mix together.
 Optionally, if you want your slime to have a different color, you can add in food coloring and mix it again. Be careful not to add in more food coloring than you need, or the color will stain your hands.
 The slime should be doughy. If it's not, add more cornstarch. You can start kneading it with your hands, if desired.


If you want stretchy slime, add a little bit of water and knead in well.
 At this point, you've finished making the slime.
 If you want to keep your slime squishy and stretchy, then keep it in an airtight container.

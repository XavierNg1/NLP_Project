 A veterinarian can confirm your dog’s pregnancy around day 28 of a typically 63-day gestation period. Your vet can advise you on breed-specific care for your pregnant dog. Start setting up a whelping box (i.e. a box for your dog to give birth in) a few weeks before the expected due date to ensure that your dog is comfortable with the spot. In general, make sure that your female remains comfortable and healthy during her gestation period., Approximately 24 hours before whelping begins, the female will begin to show symptoms – her temperature will drop and she will usually stop eating and drinking. When whelping begins, she will show signs of distress (e.g. whining, visible restlessness). While dogs are generally capable of giving birth without assistance, it is best if you are present to monitor the situation and call a veterinarian in case of emergencies., After whelping occurs, monitor your female closely. Make sure she receives adequate Vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorous in order to avoid post-natal eclampsia. She will also need two or three times more food to provide sufficient nutrition for her puppies when nursing. Experts recommend giving the female a period of rest and regeneration instead of breeding her again at her next possible breeding cycle., You should check and weigh the litter every day to make sure they are healthy and developing properly. Keep the puppies warm (with a heating pad or heat lamp, if necessary) and make sure that they are nursing properly. Once the puppies are weaned, you will have to feed them and begin to socialize them.

 Highlighter can alter how your facial structure is perceived, particularly your cheekbones. Applying it near your cheeks also provides a healthy looking glow to your complexion. Apply the eyeshadow along your cheekbones, or slightly above them. Aim for the highest point of your cheeks to add the most dimension to your face.Blend the eyeshadow out toward your temples.








Any formula will do, but a cream or liquid formula is often recommended to create a natural looking glow.
For the most natural looking results, highlight after you’ve applied your foundation, but before you apply blush.
 Highlighter used near the eyes functions in two ways. When applied under your eyes, it can banish dark circles in the same way concealer does. If you apply it to the inner corners, it “opens up” your eyes and gives you a brighter, more refreshed overall look.









Apply it to either or both areas, depending on what you’re going for, and then blend out so that the effect looks natural.Additionally, you can accentuate your eyes and give them a “lift” by applying highlighter right above and right below your brow bones., Highlighter can help you make your nose appear smaller or thinner. Apply a shimmery color down the bridge of your nose. Then use a shade that is one or two shades darker than your natural skin tone along the sides of your nose. Blend everything very well, so that it looks smooth and natural.

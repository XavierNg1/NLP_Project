 For example, knowing that Saturday is your “off” day will allow you to put boundaries around how much time you are able to devote to schoolwork versus to socializing. If you don’t waver from the pattern you establish, this division will also keep you on track - if Saturday is for play, then Sunday is for work., When you do this, you reduce the urgency to socialize with friends in other time-consuming ways.That way, you can devote more time to homework if you need to or even for independent downtime.
 Recall that as much as you can distinguish between school and extracurricular activities or hanging out with friends, studying can also be an activity that you do with or alongside others. Even if you aren’t working on the same projects, you and your friends are on the same (or a similar) boat. Observing or directly asking your friends how they balance their work and social lives can be helpful!

 Before starting a series or video, be sure to have the right number of people, and that those people don't get your video off-task and won't fool around.;
, Be sure to have cameras, a PC (for uploading and editing), an Internet connection, and more things you'll need are listed under that category.
 Start filming your film, video, or show correctly and in the right places. YouTube has now increased the video time limit to the quite big number of infinity, but you should still keep your video at 2 to 15 minutes due to human's concentration limit.
 Even though no errors were made in your filming process, you still may want to edit it to cut breaks and gaps. If desired, you can add music, pictures, and put different filmed scenes in order if necessary. This way, when watching the completed version, it will seem like it's going right to it.
 Go to YouTube and click Upload in the upper-right hand corner of the home page. Follow the directions and describe the video, and set all the things you need to set.
 After 20-30 minutes, after you clicked upload video and describing it, your video should appear in public view. If not, YouTube will explain why, and you can take steps to fix the problem.

 A combined network is any combination of series and parallel circuits wired together. Consider finding the equivalent resistance of the network shown below.


We see the resistors R1 and R2 are connected in series. So their equivalent resistance (let us denote it by Rs) is:
Rs = R1 + R2 = 100 Ω + 300 Ω = 400 Ω.

Next, we see the resistors R3 and R4 are connected in parallel. So their equivalent resistance (let us denote it by Rp1) is:
Rp1 = 1/{(1/20)+(1/20)} = 1/(2/20)= 20/2 = 10 Ω

Then we see the resistors R5 and R6 are also connected in parallel. So their equivalent resistance (let us denote it by Rp2) is:
Rp2 = 1/{(1/40)+(1/10)} = 1/(5/40) = 40/5 = 8 Ω

So now we have a circuit with the resistors Rs, Rp1, Rp2 and R7 connected in series. These can now simply be added to get the equivalent resistance R7 of the network given to us originally.
Req = 400 Ω + 20Ω + 8 Ω = 428 Ω.

 There are 0.9144 meters in every yard. Simply multiply that number by the number of yards to get the number of meters. The formula to convert yards to meters is: m=yd X 0.9144.


This calculation was determined in 1958 by the United States and Commonwealth countries, such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.If you are trying to convert, say, 100 yards to meters, you would simply multiple 0.9144 by 100 (answer: 91.44 meters). The formula to calculate 2 yards would be 2 X .09144 meter = 1.8288 meter, and so on. ;

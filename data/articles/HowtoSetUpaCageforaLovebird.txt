 Know how many birds you'll have. Are you keeping just one, a pair, or a whole flock? Get them the biggest cage you can afford so they have room to fly and move, but a minimum for a single bird is 2 feet (0.6 m) tall, wide, and long, and even with that size you should allow them time to exercise outside the cage.


Don't put birds in round cages, because with no corners to hide in, they tend to feel unsafe. Stick to square or rectangular.
Bars should be spaced at maximum 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm), to keep the bird from getting stuck or slipping out.;
,


NEVER use walnut, corn cobs, cedar shavings or kitty litter. All contain toxic ingredient that, if ingested, could harm or kill your bird.
 Lovebirds enjoy moving around, so have various perches of different, height, diameter, and texture.
 Most birds will often prefer certain toys, so try a few out with them. Toys such as ladders, ropes, bells, swings are recommended, but always check that the material is safe.


Try not to overcrowd the cage with toys. Use common sense, and adjust the amount and size based on the size of both the cage and bird.
 Wash and replenish both daily, even if it seems like the bird hasn't eaten.

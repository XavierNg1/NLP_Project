Look carefully at a calendar and make stars on the dates you are, or think you are, available.
Ask yourself which day of the week you would like to have it. Weekends would probably work best for your guests, because they may be at school or work during the weekdays.
As for the time of day, ask yourself if you want to avoid dinner hour and start in the evening, or go ahead and have your party around lunchtime for a long day full of relaxation.
Write down the date and time you chose on a piece of paper. Make sure you stay organized!;
, You need to think about this. You have the option of having professionals run the event or, if you want to stick with creativity and let your guests feel homey, you can hold your spa party at your house.

A large basement works best for a home party, but if you don't have one and really want to set up your spa in a basement, ask a friend who does have one. Big basements allow guests lots of room to switch stations and enjoy themselves.
 Try to shorten them so that you can put some details on your invitation.

What activities are you planning to do?
What foods will be served?
Is there anything special that your guests need to do or bring?

, Do you have all details ready? Is the day you picked perfect? Make sure you have these things written on your list:

A date and time the spa party starts and ends.
The location of the spa party.
Details about the party.
Your phone number for the RSVP.
Any other additional details about your party.

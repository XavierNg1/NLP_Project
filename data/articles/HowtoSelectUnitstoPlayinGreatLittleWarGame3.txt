 Airborne units are the air-based attack units. They are made in the Airport. Tap on the Airport to see what units are available.


Not all units are available at all times. The units’ availability may depend on the mission or on your available gold coins.
 There are two different Airborne units in the game.


A Fighter is the ultimate anti-air unit, able to attack and take down all types of airborne units. It can only attack airborne units. It costs 350 gold coins.
A Bomber is the ultimate air unit against all types of units, except for airborne units. It’s basically the opposite of a Fighter. It costs 350 gold coins.
 Tap on the unit you want to build, and then tap on the “Buy” button with the amount of gold coins need to make it.


You can only buy a unit that you can afford. The selected unit will immediately be generated from the Airport, ready for use.

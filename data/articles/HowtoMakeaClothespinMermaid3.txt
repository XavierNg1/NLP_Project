 Make them a good length.
 Check that the hair is hanging evenly each side. Then glue in place, making sure that it doesn't cover the front of the top of the clothespin, which will be the mermaid's face.
 Either tie with the same yarn or use small hair elastics (braces bands are ideal!).


You could braid the hair if preferred, or simply leave it flowing loose.

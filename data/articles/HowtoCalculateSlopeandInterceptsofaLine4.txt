 In the formula, y = the y-coordinate of any point on the line, m = slope, x = the x-coordinate of any point on the line, and b = the y-intercept.


y=mx+b{\displaystyle y=mx+b} is the equation of a line. The y-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis.
 Remember, the slope is equal to the rise over the run. If you need help finding the slope, see the instructions above.

For example, if the slope is 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, and on point on the line is (5,4), then the formula will look like this: 4=34(5)+b{\displaystyle 4={\frac {3}{4}}(5)+b}.
 First multiply the slope and the x-coordinate. Subtract this number from both sides to solve for b.

In the example problem the equation becomes 4=334+b{\displaystyle 4=3{\frac {3}{4}}+b}. Subtracting 334{\displaystyle 3{\frac {3}{4}}} from both sides, you end up with 14=b{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}=b}. So the y-intercept is 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}.
 On a coordinate graph, plot your known point, then draw a line using the slope. To find the y-intercept, look for the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

For example, if the slope is 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, and one point is (5,4), draw a point at (5,4), then draw other points along the line by counting to the left 3 and down 4. When you draw a line through the points, you should see the line cross the y-axis just above the (0,0) coordinate.

 Do this when you are frying, searing or cooking at high temperatures. A high smoke point is defined as one that is above 400 degrees Fahrenheit (205 degrees Celsius).Some examples of cooking fats that have a high smoke point are beef fat, ghee, extra-light olive oil, almond oil, avocado oil, palm oil, and peanut oil.
Remember to avoid fats that contain a high percentage of polyunsaturated fats when cooking.
 These fats can be used for medium to high-heat cooking such as saut√©ing, stir frying, and pan frying. These cooking fats start to burn and degrade around 350 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (175 to 205 degrees Celsius).Some examples of cooking fats with a medium smoke point are chicken fat, lard, some varieties of ghee, butter, canola oil, coconut oil, and vegetable shortening.
 These fats are typically liquid fats like oils. Fats with a low smoke point should be eaten raw. These fats start to burn and degrade below 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). They can be used to make salad dressings or drizzled on food to enhance the flavors of the food.Hemp oil and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) have a low smoke point.

 He can't seem to look at you directly. And when he does look at you, he looks straight into your eyes. He responds with short, tentative, quiet and incoherent sentences. He touches his hair. He speaks to you in a very quiet, gentle, and tentative voice. He instantly and voluntarily agrees to all your challenges, bets, wants, etc.. (for instance, you jokingly offer a box of candy to whomever will accept your dare, and he accepts without second thoughts). He jerks away from your touch as though you have a contagious disease. He comments on your new haircut/clothes/jewelry. He offers you reassurance when you put yourself down, even though he's not the type to usually console someone. He frequently makes comments on things you dislike (e.g., bands, celebrities, sexism,) then looks at you, smirks, and waits for you to react. He constantly challenges/bets you to do things and waits patiently for you to do it. His feet are pointed towards you. It's a very subtle sign but it means he's unconsciously reacting to you.
He almost sits by you but jerks away quickly.;

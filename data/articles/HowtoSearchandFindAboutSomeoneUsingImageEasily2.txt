 TinEye is a search engine designed to search through images. You can search using either an image's URL or by uploading an image file. While TinEye does not find similar images, you can use it to quickly trace the origin of an image.


To find an image's address, right-click on it and select "Copy image address/URL."
To save an image to your computer, right-click on it and select "Save image."

, Go to tineye.com in your web browser.
 Click the Upload button to browse your computer for an image file, or paste the copied image URL into the field.
 TinyEye will only return results for the same image, so browse through the results to find the origin of the image file.
 The page that contains the image may be able to give you more information as to the person's identity. Check out a couple of the results to see if you can learn more about the person in the image. Look for image captions or the paragraph text around the image.

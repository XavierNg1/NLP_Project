Now, if your baby needs your attention while you are pumping, go ahead and stop pumping to take care of him/her and go back to pumping when you can. It's frustrating at first but it's important not to wait until you are sure you have 15-40 minutes free to pump. Babies are unpredictable and you may not get many times like that.
 Any more variation than that and your breasts will spend some time full telling your body not to pump.

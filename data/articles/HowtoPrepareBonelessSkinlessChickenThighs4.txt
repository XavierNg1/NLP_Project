 Place a kitchen thermometer into your chicken. Your chicken is ready to eat when it is 160° Fahrenheit (74°C). If the chicken is any lower than this, it is not safe to eat. Continue cooking until the correct temperature appears on the thermometer., Take your chicken and set it on a plate. Give your chicken 5 to 10 minutes of rest before you cut into it. This is a great time to apply any extra barbecue sauce you might have. If you cut into the thigh too early, the moisture will leave.
 Sit the chicken on a clean plate. You can slice it, or leave it whole. Add some lemon wedges and a lettuce leaf for appearances. You can sprinkle some extra seasoning overtop, or drizzle some sauce onto the chicken. Dip your side dishes onto the plate as well.

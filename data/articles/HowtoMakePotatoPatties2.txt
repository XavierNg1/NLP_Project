 You can use leftover mashed potatoes, or you can make them from scratch. If you are making mashed potatoes from scratch, do the following:


Peel and cut 4 medium-sized potatoes.
Fill a large pot with salted water.
Boil the potatoes until they are soft and tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.
Drain the water.
Smash the potatoes with a fork or potato masher.
 For the cheese, you can use either mozzarella or cheddar. If you don't have any onion powder, or just don't like the taste, you can use thinly-sliced green onions.
 You will be adding one of these beaten eggs to the potato mixture, and you will be using the other one for frying.
 Stir it in with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until it is evenly mixed throughout the potatoes.
 Roll the potato mixture into balls first, then gently flatten them with the palm of your hand.
 Be sure to coat both sides of each patty with the beaten egg and the breadcrumbs. This will ensure that the patties get a nice, crispy texture once you fry them.


Place the breadcrumbs into a shallow dish large enough to fit at least one potato patty.
 Fry the potato patties until they turn golden, about 15 to 20 minutes. Flip them over using a spatula, then cook them for another 15 minutes.


Do not use all of the oil all at once, or the first few patties will be much oilier than the later ones. Instead, use a little bit of oil at a time. Add more oil with each new batch of patties.
 You can serve them as they are, or season them further with some salt and pepper. They make a great side dish, but can also stand out on their own.

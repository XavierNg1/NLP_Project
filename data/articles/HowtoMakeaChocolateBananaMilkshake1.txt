 This will make it easier to mix in and give you a smoother milkshake in the end. If you'd like your milkshakes extra thick, use a frozen banana instead.;
, You can use vanilla ice cream for a less-intense flavor, or chocolate ice cream for a more intense flavor.
 You can use any type of milk, but whole milk will give you a richer-tasting milkshake. If you like your milkshakes on the thin side, use up to 1 cup (240 milliliters) of milk. If you like your milkshakes on the thicker side, use only 1/3 cup (80 milliliters) of milk.
 If you used vanilla ice cream, you may want to use up to 5 tablespoons of chocolate syrup. If you are using chocolate ice cream, you might want to use only 2 tablespoons so as not to overwhelm the banana flavor.For extra flavor, add 1 tablespoon of smooth peanut butter., There should be no lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls. If the milkshake isn't blending smoothly enough, pause the blender, and use a spatula to scrape the ingredients down the sides.


If you'd like some extra crunch, ad Â¼ cup (45 grams) of mini chocolate chips in the last few seconds of blending., Pour the milkshake into one or two tall glasses and add a straw. If you'd like, you can garnish it with a swirl of whipped cream, some chocolate sauce, or chocolate curls.

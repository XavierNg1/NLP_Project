 Mastitis symptoms resemble those of flu. Feeling unusually tired and achy, experiencing chills, having a headache or the presence of a fever are all indications that an infection is more than likely present.This will frequently happen before you experience any symptoms with your breasts.


Stress, fatigue, and being a first-time mother increase your chances of acquiring mastitis.
Remember, mastitis is an illness. Get plenty of rest, and stay hydrated. This will help replenish your immune system.
 Discuss your symptoms with a physician as soon as they develop. Mastitis can rapidly progress into an abscess which can require disfiguring surgery to resolve. Several antibiotics are deemed safe to take while nursing.Continue taking all medications even if you are feeling better. If antibiotics are discontinued before the infection is completely cured, mastitis can come back.
If you don't feel better within 2-3 days of starting antibiotics, contact your medical provider.

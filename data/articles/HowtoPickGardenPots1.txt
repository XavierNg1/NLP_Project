 Various types of pots will cost different amounts of money. Terracotta pots and plastic pots are typically the most affordable types of pots that you can get. Cast iron, concrete, and glazed ceramic pots are often the most expensive. Determine how much money you have in your budget, and look for pots that you can afford., Many terracotta pots are ornate and can add to your interior decor. The subtle colors of the material match well with many different plant types. On the downside, the material is also somewhat more fragile than other pots and has to be brought indoors during the winter., If your primary goal is to add to your decor, you should choose a ceramic pot that matches with the scenery. Glazed ceramic pots come in a wide variety of colors and shapes. Select a container that matches the aesthetic of your apartment, garden, or house., If you are housing plants that are meant to be permanent outdoor fixtures in your landscaping, concrete and cast iron pots are the best options. These pots will be able to withstand harsh weather and won't degrade or break down quickly., Regardless of the type of plant, improper drainage or overwatering can cause water to build on the bottom of the pot which can lead to rot or mold. To avoid this, look for pots that have drainage holes and remember to buy a saucer with the pot at the time of purchase. This will ensure that your plant receives the right amount of drainage., If you are looking for pots in person, make sure that you take a look at the pot to make sure there are no chips, cracks, or imperfections. This will help narrow down your decision when deciding which one to purchase.

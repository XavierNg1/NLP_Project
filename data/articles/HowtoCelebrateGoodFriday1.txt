For Roman Catholics: There is no mass on Good Friday; however, there is usually a service with Holy Communion. Pray before the Lord in the Blessed Sacrament. The Holy Rosary is especially good prayer for Good Friday.
In addition to Holy Mass, many Churches may also have the Stations of the Cross, which may like to attend.



If in the event you are hosting guests, you may offer them afternoon tea, with some 'hot cross buns.' These are sticky fruit buns, with some dough at the top, in the shape of a cross. You may have it toasted, or plain.
 Some people refrain from eating at all, and some people eat very lightly. If you are still growing, it might be a good idea to eat lightly. See the section for Byzantine Christians below.
 Traditionally, Jesus died on the cross at this time.
 It is the whole idea of Good Friday.

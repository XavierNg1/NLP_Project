Picasa is Google's application for handling photos and storing them on the Internet. You can add a watermark in Picasa that is white text. You cannot choose to put a logo as a watermark at this point.
 You will need to export them to do this.


On Windows operating systems (OS), hold down the "Shift" button and click on photos to select more than 1 photo to watermark. On Mac OS, hold down the "Command" button and click on photos to select more than 1.
 This will be found in your photo tray. You will need to have a folder to which you can export the photos.
,,, You can also add a watermark when you are uploading photos. Before you download, click "Tools" then "Options" on a Windows OS and click "Picasa" then "Preferences" in Mac OS. Click on the tab that says "Picasa Web Albums." Select "Add a Watermark." Type your text. Click "OK" and your albums will arrive in your uploaded album with watermark protection.

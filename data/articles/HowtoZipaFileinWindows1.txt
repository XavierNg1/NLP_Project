 Locate the file or folder you wish to zip and right-click on it to open the context menu.


In order to select more than one file to zip, press and hold the Ctrl button on the keyboard while clicking each file. Please note, however, that in order to use this, the files or folders need to be located in the same folder.;
,, From the menu given under “Send to,” select “Compressed (zipped) folder.” A small icon should appear in the same window with an identical file or folder name, but it will have a zipper on the icon. This means that the file or folder is zipped and ready to go.


If you would like to add another folder to your new zip folder, simply click and hold on a file or folder, and drag it over the new zip folder. Release the mouse button and the file or folder will be added.

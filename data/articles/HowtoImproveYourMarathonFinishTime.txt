 Many runners gear up and meet friends after work to go for a run. The important thing is to establish a routine to which you can commit.;
, A typical marathon training program begins with a 10 mile (16 km) run and builds to 20–24 miles (32–39 km). The long runs are the most important part of any marathon training program.
 Find one that fits your ability level. Here are two good sites: www.marathontraining.com/marathon/m_sch_1.html , www.halhigdon.com/marathon/Mar00intermediate.htm .
 Run half the distance of your long run scheduled for the next day; this will get you accustomed to running at this pace.
 Pushing through this fatigue will train your body and mind to fight through fatigue and pain during a marathon. Conduct this run anywhere between 45 to 90 seconds per mile slower than your marathon pace.
 You are now ready for your fastest marathon.
 Your marathon pace is the speed at you plan on running the marathon for which you are training. Divide your desired finish time by 26.2. For example, if you want to run a 4 hour marathon, your pace will be 6.55 mph (10.54 km/h) or 9:09 minutes per mile.
 Hill work will strengthen your legs, and speed work will train your body to transfer oxygen into your blood faster. Both will mentally prepare you for the discomforts of running a marathon.
 Reduce your weekly and long run mileage two weeks prior to your marathon. During these final two weeks, long workouts cannot benefit or further prepare your body. You must now let your body rest and heal.

 Focus your attention on your breathing.
 Simply press the thumb against your nostril to block it.
 Fill your lungs with air. First, feel the diaphragm move down, allowing the lungs to expand and forcing the abdomen out; then feel your chest expand with your collar bones rising last.
 Keep your right hand by your nose and your lungs full of air.
 Most people find it easier to continue using the same hand to block either nostril, but you’re welcome to switch hands depending on which nostril you’re blocking.


You can also switch if your arm gets tired.
 Feel the collar bones dropping, chest deflating, and abdomen shrinking as the lungs collapse. When you've finished exhaling, keep your left nostril closed.
 Fill your lungs.
, This process is one round of Anulom Vilom Pranayam.
 You may take a minute's rest after every five minutes of exercise.

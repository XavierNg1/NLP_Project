 Once you have been shot out of the cannon, you will land in the Gerudo Desert. After a cut-scene with Midna, head southeast (avoid pits and crevices in the desert). You will also be attacked by Gerudo Moldorms which burrow around you and jump at you. You can pull them out with your Clawshot. It takes about two or three hits to kill them.;
, A large pillar (actually a piece of bridge) is sticking out of the top.
 You can't jump up onto the ledge so use your clawshot and attach to the Peahat (flying plant) and wait for it to fly over to the next ledge. Shadow Beasts will appear so kill them all. Get to the piece of bridge. Tell Midna to warp the piece of bridge to the Bridge of Eldin (if you have defeated the Shadow Beasts and opened a portal there yet) and then warp back to the desert.
 The Temple, or as we know it, Arbiter's Grounds, is in sight. Head over to it while killing the Moldorms and avoiding the pits. When you get the the gate, there will be a small little camp of Bulbins.
 To charge just hit the 'A' button and it will rage around. Go through the wooden gate.
 In this part (pray it is nighttime, which it should be), you have to snipe all the Bulblins before they see you and sound an alarm which will call an endless supply of Bulbins. Do not attempt to charge one: snipe them all! It helps if you have the Hawkeye, but you don't need it.
 When you arrive at a camp with a tent and a pig on a split over a fire, snipe all the Bulbins.
, It should be just around the corner of the camp where you got the key. Open it. Walk inside.
 Oh No! King Bulblin has returned and now he will battle you on foot. When he strikes with his axe go behind him and hit him in the back a few times. (back-slice works well too) .
 After you beat him he will limp away and the place will set on fire. Get on the Bullbo and hit 'A'. Charge through the gate you came in. You will charge through all the walls and eventually you will arrive at the Main Entrance.

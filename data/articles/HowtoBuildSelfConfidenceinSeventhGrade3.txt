 When you’re going through physical changes like puberty, your body is often on your mind. However, if you think about your body as an instrument instead of as an object, you can focus on appreciating how it lets you experience and do things in the world rather than on how it looks.Media can play a big part in how you think about your body. It’s important to realize that the physical ideals portrayed in the media are not realistic. They’re air-brushed and manipulated images that should not be used to judge yourself by.
Focus on qualities, not looks. This goes for how you think about yourself as well as about others.
 Your body is deeply connected to how you feel. When you exercise, it helps you become more confident about your body while relieving pent-up stress.Pick a physical activity that you enjoy doing, so this doesn’t feel like a chore. It can be anything from skateboarding to shooting hoops to line dancing.
 You may not be able to control everything that’s happening with your body, so it’s important to take charge of those things that you can control. Take good care of your body, and keep yourself feeling well by getting enough sleep and eating nutritious food.For instance, pack a lunch instead of eating fast food. Start opting for fruits, veggies, nuts, and/or whole grains instead of junk food when you’re craving a snack.
Making healthy choices also means avoiding drugs and other substances that negatively affect your physical and mental health.

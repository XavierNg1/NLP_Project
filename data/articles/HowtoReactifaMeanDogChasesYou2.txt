 Staying calm is essential in any encounter with an aggressive animal. Resist the urge to scream and continue to stand tall while asserting your presence. You can use a stern voice, but yelling loudly may further excite the dog., While you may think of eye contact as a good way to show you're engaging with someone, it means something else entirely to a dog. An aggressive dog will see eye contact as a challenge or threat to its dominance. This could cause the dog to attack you, even if it did not previously seem like it would.Don't make eye contact, but keep paying attention to what the dog is doing. You need to be able to react if the dog lunges towards you.
 If the dog recognizes basic verbal commands, it should respond to your orders. Even if the dog is excited, a strong verbal command should break the dog's attack.However, some dogs won't recognize commands at all. In this case, verbal commands will not be effective.


Use a firm, commanding voice to tell the dog to "sit," "lie down," or "go home."
Be confident when you give verbal commands. Dogs can sense fear or uncertainty, so make sure you let the dog know who's in charge with the tone of your voice.
 Distracting an aggressive dog will give you time to sneak away.If nothing else, a distraction may help calm an excited dog down and break its desire to chase you. Any object can be used as a distraction if you catch the dog's attention with it.


If you have any dog treats, dog toys, or any type of food on your person, throw them on the ground in front of the dog.
If you don't have any food or toys, try to find a stick to throw. This might distract the dog or make it transition into a more playful mood.

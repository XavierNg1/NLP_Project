 Start by picking up the hairball with a clump of paper towels. Blot the area with clean water and then pat it dry with a cloth. Spray the affected area with a good carpet cleaner, especially one designed for pet stains, and blot it with a cloth. Finally, rinse the area with water and blot it dry.Your urge may be to remove the hairball right away, but it's best to let the hairball firm up a bit before removal.
Blot the area lightly; do not apply too much pressure, as this may cause the stain to penetrate deeper into the carpeting.;
, This is a natural alternative if you don't like using chemical carpet cleaning agents. Blend together two tablespoons of white vinegar with a pint of water into an empty spray container. Remove the hairball using a paper towel. Spray the area generously, then blot the area with with a clean towel. Repeat as necessary until the stain is fully removed.
 These can be used as they come and do not need to be diluted like vinegar. Simply remove the hairball, dry the stain and then apply a generous amount of either shaving cream or club soda to the problem spot. Dry it by blotting. Repeat as necessary.
 Pick up any solid material with a paper towel. Cover the moist area with a layer of salt about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick. If the hairball is already dry, spray it with water to wet it down thoroughly, then apply salt.


Wait for the salt to dry, which may take 12-24 hours, maybe longer if it's cold or damp. Step on the salt and grind it up with your foot to break it up.
Brush it into a dustpan using a stiff scrub brush or vacuum it up. You may need to pick some particles out of the carpet.

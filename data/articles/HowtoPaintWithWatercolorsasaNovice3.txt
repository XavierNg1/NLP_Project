 Some watercolor artists only use a single brush. The most common brush you’ll use water coloring is a size 5-8, round brush.A round brush has rounded bristles that come to form a fine tip at the end. They are versatile brushes, and can paint detail and larger areas. A good watercolor brush will be able to hold a lot of water and paint.


Sable brushes are the best but most expensive brushes to use for water coloring.If you’re on a budget, try buying a synthetic brush.
 Watercolor pencils are a great alternative to real paint if you’re a beginner. They work like regular pencils, but interact with water on paper to create paint. Tube watercolor paint looks similar to acrylic paint and needs to be diluted with water as well. Tubed paint is necessary if you want to paint on larger canvasses, or want to give a deeper and richer feeling to your watercolor paintings. Pan sets on the other hand are hardened paints that come as a box set.Pan sets are great for smaller paintings, or if you’re on the go.


If you are brand new to painting all together you should look into watercolor pencils. If you’ve painted using other mediums however, tubed paint will probably feel more familiar to you.
Pan sets are great for beginners as well.
 There are different varieties, weights, and textures of paper that you can get. Heavier paper is more expensive, but will be able to hold your paint better, while lighter paper might buckle or wrinkle when touching water. Rough paper will take your paint and water well and gives your painting luminosity.There is students’ and artists’ quality paper. Artist quality is higher grade and will stand the test of time, while student grade paper may yellow over time.
The difference between regular paper and watercolor paper is the level of absorbency. Regular computer paper is too absorbent and will cause your paint to spiderweb.Some paper is also tinted off white which can give your paintings a different effect.

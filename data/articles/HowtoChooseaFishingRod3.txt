 Comfort is an important factor when choosing a fishing rod and a rod may feel different in different people's hands. , Look for any cracks or poor workmanship in the rod. Defects may make it more likely for the rod to break in the future. If the rod breaks down into more than one piece, attach the pieces in the store and make sure they attach securely with no wiggle room.
 The guides are the loops that attach the line to the rod. They may be made of any kind of metal or ceramic. The more guides there are the better quality the rod, as the line is more controlled by the rod.


Hold the rod at eye level and look down the length of the rod from the tip to the butt to make sure the guides line up properly.

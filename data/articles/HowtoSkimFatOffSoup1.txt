 Fill a large mixing bowl with ice water, then dunk a large metal spoon in that water. Keep the spoon submerged for several minutes.


The ice water should be roughly one part ice and four parts water. Make sure that you prepare enough ice water to cover the entire spoon.
You must use a metal spoon for this method. The spoon must become very cold, and a plastic spoon will not become as cold as a metal spoon.;
, Run the bottom of the spoon cavity along the surface of the soup. Lift the spoon and discard any fat that has stuck to the bottom.


When the cold metal touches the hot soup, the fat that has gathered near the surface should quickly coagulate onto the spoon. Most of the partially hardened fat will remain stuck on the spoon, allowing you to remove it by merely lifting the spoon away., Any fat that falls away from the spoon can be scooped into the cavity of the spoon and discarded.


Hold the spoon at a slight angle so that only one edge can scrape across the surface of the soup. Drag this edge over the surface, peeling up as much fat and as little soup broth as possible in the process.

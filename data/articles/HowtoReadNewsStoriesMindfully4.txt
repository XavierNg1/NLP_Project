 Disable automatic news alerts on your phone or tablet if you find you’re feeling overwhelmed by the news. It may also help to take a break from reading articles online for a few days or hide news pop-ups in your social-media feed. Instead, use your time to perform an activity you enjoy. Something low-tech, such as walking or gardening, may help you regain some peace., Many email clients, such as Gmail, enable you to direct news alerts to a separate mailbox. If you receive newsletters or alerts digitally, filter them to another part of your inbox temporarily. Doing this will keep you from feeling ambushed by news in your main inbox when you’re trying to do work or chat with friends.You can even create a special inbox called “news” so that you can read these alerts when you feel ready.
 Choose news outlets that specialize their content in your area of interest, if you’re feeling overwhelmed. This will keep you from feeling swamped with other news you want to avoid for a few days. You can also choose to read only one section of the newspaper that most appeals to your interests for a period of time.

If you like foreign policy, for example, spend a week reading just Foreign Affairs or Foreign Policy magazine.
If you want to tune out national politics, you might choose to read only the local section of the newspaper for a few days.
 Replace your normal news routine with one that helps you look on the bright side. Certain websites and magazines, such as Positive News, specialize in quality reporting that is factual but also uplifting. If you find yourself feeling tired or overwhelmed by major news outlets, take a mental break with one of these sites. You’ll still have plenty to talk about with friends and may even lift their moods too.

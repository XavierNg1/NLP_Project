 It shows you are friendly and happy. It is one of the easiest things you can do to be more beautiful.
 Be happy! Know you are lucky to be who you are. You're beautiful!

, When you have confidence people respect that and you feel better about yourself.


To be confident doesn't mean to gossip and speak badly to people, it just means to believe in your values and opinions. On a lesser note, it means that you like what you wear and know it looks good.

This still does not mean you should criticize people for their values and opinions.
 No one will want to be around you if you gossip, lie, and are just an all-around horrible person. This is one of the foundations of having a good day. And if you aren't, then you'll probably end up saying, "I regret doing that!" or "What was I thinking? She just wanted to be nice!"

 Many disability services do not have offices at a high school. A school administrator, teacher or counselor can help you to deal with day to day issues that arise due to your disability.


This contact can also be an advocate. In case of problems, you can come up with a plan and discuss it with your individual teachers together.
 The rise of technology, including smart phones and computers with visual or audio cues may mean that you can be permitted to use educational devices during school hours. Discuss the possible adoption and purchase of aides to help you at school.


A school's disability program is tasked with providing services to a large variety of disabilities and within a budget. They are not always able to stay at the cutting edge of educational devices, so you should consider researching new technology and bringing it to their attention for the future.
 During high school, students should know their rights as a disabled person. In order to receive help in high school and later life, you will need to know what to ask for and what is required by law.
 By talking with people who have the same disabilities as you, it may be easier to deal with the struggles of your disability. Online disability support groups encourage conversations on things like educational aides, emotional situations and getting support from services or schools.

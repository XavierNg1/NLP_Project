 Although you can just as easily keep the Cheyenne cigars in their original pack, storing them in a humidor may be a good idea if you're leaving them alone for a long time.


Cheyenne cigars are generally considered to be budget cigars, so you may not choose to treat them as you would a "real" cigar.
 If you haven't already, throw the pack in the garbage when you've exhausted all of the cigars. You should avoid littering your packs on the ground whenever possible.
 Children and youth are not allowed to smoke cigars or cigarettes. For the sake of responsibility, keep your cigars somewhere where they're not at risk of being picked up and used by children.
 Because a cigar is a fairly nuanced experience, it's good form to take a couple of minutes after smoking to reflect on the tastes and scent of the cigar. What was the flavour, smell and body of the cigar? Most importantly, did you like it? Reflecting on the cigar is made more enjoyable if you've sampled a variety of cigar flavours. That way, you can compare and contrast them and pick which of them was your favourite.
 With that in mind, it's not surprising that there's a dedicated community behind the appreciation of cigars. Talk about your Cheyenne cigar experience with friends and other cigar aficionados. From there, they may be able to give you recommendations on different types of cigar to choose.

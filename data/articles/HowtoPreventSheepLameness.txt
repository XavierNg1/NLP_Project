 Lameness, to any degree, is causing sheep pain. It is a welfare issue and as an industry that prides itself on high levels of welfare, such pain is not acceptable. The image of sheep grazing happily in fields is something that needs to be preserved. It isn't something to be tainted by lame sheep, particularly as welfare creeps up on the public and government agendas.


Lame sheep cannot eat properly, or at all. This affects its health, immunity and production value.;
, Lameness expert Laura Green, of Warwick University, estimates that it could be costing as much as £10-15 for every ewe put to the tup with 8% lameness in the flock, that's up to £15,000 for a 1,000-ewe flock.
 Focus on recording which sheep are lame. Persistently cull lame sheep humanely. Green suggests this should occur only after the third treatment is unsuccessful.
 When buying in stock, always quarantine the sheep before introducing them to your existing flock. , Distinguish between foot-rot and CODD (contagious ovine digital dermatitis). If you're not sure, talk to your vet and learn all that you can.


Isolate sheep undergoing treatment.
Apply appropriate treatment options as recommended by the vet. A long-lasting antibiotic injection may be the first option.
Do not trim the sheep's feet during recovery.
Do not breed from treated sheep.
 Use hydrated builder's lime on all handling areas.


Handling areas should have hard ground, without stones. This will stop harm occurring to the sheep's feet.
Consider using portable handling areas. These have the advantage of being moved around and prevent the congregation of lots of sheep in any one spot, reducing the possibilities for contagiousness.
 Adopt a foot-rot vaccination program

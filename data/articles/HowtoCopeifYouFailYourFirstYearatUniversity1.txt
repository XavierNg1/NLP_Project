 Go through the course catalogue and make a star next to any classes that get you excited about going back into the classroom. One of the best ways to cope with academic failure is finding classes that you’d really love to take. If you can feel jazzed about resuming your studies, even if the subject material might be different from what you studied last year, it’ll be easier to move on from previous struggles.;
, Think about what aspects of your classes gave you the most trouble in the previous year. Was is the format of the test? Did you have to write difficult papers? Once you identify what challenged you, seek advice from a professor or teaching assistant. Ask if they have recommendations or strategies for how to succeed in areas that you find particularly daunting. f>http://www.academictips.org/acad/first_y_i_c/learnfromfailure.html</ref>


Take notes during your meeting and decide on a realistic course of action. Ask professors for additional resources that you can engage with over the summer in order to better prepare for success during the next school year.
 The transition to university life is hugely disruptive and can cause many students to feel lonely and overwhelmed during their first year. For many students, failure in the first year is not a reflection of academic ability, but a symptom of an underlying emotional or psychological issue. Recognize that it is 100% normal to need time to adjust to the social, emotional, and mental hurdles of college. Even if you feel emotionally sound, talking with a counselor about ways to achieve academic success can help keep you on track.


Always be aware that there are groups and organizations to support students through academic and emotional struggles. If you were unable to achieve the success you wanted during your first year, talk to a trusted loved one about seeking some additional support through a mental health professional.

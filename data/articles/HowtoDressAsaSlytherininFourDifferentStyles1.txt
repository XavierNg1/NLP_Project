 For this, you will need a green tie, a ruler, a pencil, Scotch masking tape, and a silver paint pen. It is best if you buy an inexpensive green tie, as you will likely not be getting too much use out of it. Also, be sure the tie is in a Slytherin shade, meaning evergreen as opposed to lime or mint green.


Use the ruler to measure one inch from the very bottom point of the tie. Make a small mark with the pencil at the one inch mark, and then run the Scotch tape along this mark in a diagonal line. Repeat this all the way up the tie.
Use the paint pen to completely fill in the spaces between the Scotch tape. Make sure there is no green showing.
Allow the tie to dry before removing the tape. If done properly, you should have a series of even diagonal lines on your tie.;
, Make sure the collar is very pressed, as no Slytherin would go out looking anything less than polished. Tie on the tie. If you do not wish to make a tie, you may order a green and silver or green and white scarf. Careful, as these may be hard to find.
 You may use a grey sweater vest or sweater, as long as it has a relatively low neckline. Be sure to tuck in your tie.
 Many people choose darker wash jeans for their look though, and either are alright.
 You can also make a proper robe on your own.
 There are a wide variety of crests out there. Choose one you like from the Internet, print it, cut it our carefully, and glue to a piece of felt. Trim the felt around the edges of the crest. Sew or pin the crest to your shirt or cloak.
 Girls should straighten or neatly curl their hair, and boys should comb their hair over or back.

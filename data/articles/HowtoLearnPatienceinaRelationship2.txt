 Learning to be patient takes patience. If you are easily frustrated, that isn’t likely to change overnight. Being hard on yourself will only add to your frustration. Instead, recognize that you are working toward being more patient and forgive yourself for any mistakes that you make along the way.For example, if you get frustrated sitting in traffic, recognize that you are frustrated and try to calm down. Then let it go. There is no need to be frustrated about being frustrated.
 If you want to be more patient, you’ll need to set some goals. This way you can have a clear definition of how you are succeeding. Each goal you reach will help energize you to reach the next. Some examples of goals that lead to being more patient might be things like:Waiting in line without being frustrated.
Keeping a positive attitude with co-workers.
Overlooking things that your significant other does that you find annoying.
 Being patient benefits you in many ways. First of all, it allows your relationships to be more loving and respectful. Being patient also helps you remain calmer and more at peace with yourself. When you start to feel frustrated, keep in mind that responding with patience will help you live a more satisfying life., Most people have an inner dialogue that plays out in their minds day in and day out. This is your “self-talk.” Just like the things other people say, your self-talk can tear you down, or it can boost your confidence. When you analyze yourself and think (or talk) to yourself about being patient, focus on your progress in a positive way.


For example, avoid thoughts like “I’m just not patient enough to deal with that.” Instead, frame it in a positive by thinking or saying something like “Dealing with that is going to require a lot of patience.”

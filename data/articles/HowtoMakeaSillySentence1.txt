 Get together in a group of two or more friends. Play Nose Goes or Rock Paper Scissors to decide who goes first. You can also just take turns starting each sentence.;
, This will start the sentence. A noun can be a person (like "Fred" or "a doctor"), a place ("the zoo" or "England"), or a thing ("potatoes" or "the floor").
 Each person who plays the game adds another word to the sentence. For example:


Amy says "Fred"
Bob says "Fred likes"
Camille says "Fred likes green"
Amy says "Fred likes green bacon"
Bob says "Fred likes green bacon because"
Camille says "Fred likes green bacon because ___" (pick the next word yourself!)

, Keep playing until the sentence is too long to remember, or until you think it sounds good enough. Play more rounds, and write down your favorites to save and laugh at later.


You can also try writing a whole "silly story" with your friends, where each person writes one sentence.

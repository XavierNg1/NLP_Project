 Bleach is effective at killing germs and bacteria on wood. However, it can be toxic if ingested and harsh on wood, possibly damaging it. If you do use a cleaner that contains bleach, or make a bleach cleaner at home with one part bleach and ten parts water, apply it to the wooden blocks with caution.








Always wipe down the blocks really well with a damp cloth after applying the bleach cleaner. Let the blocks air dry to ensure there is no remaining bleach on the blocks.
 You can find non toxic, all natural commercial wood cleaners at your local hardware store or online. Most commercial wood cleaners come in a spray bottle that you then apply to the blocks.








Make sure you wipe the blocks down with a clean damp cloth after you apply the cleaner. Let the blocks air dry.
 Furniture polish contains harsh chemicals that can damage the wooden blocks and be toxic if ingested. Never apply furniture polish to wooden blocks, especially if they are going to be handled by children as toys.

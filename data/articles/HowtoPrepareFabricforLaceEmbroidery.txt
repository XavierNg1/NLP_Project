 It is important to check the cotton net tulle prior to embroidering to see if requires cleaning or not. If you are certain of the quality of the fabric, there will probably be no need to wash it. If, however, you are not sure of its quality, be sure to wash and iron the cotton net tulle thoroughly prior to using. If you do need to wash it:


Wash the fabric gently by hand.
Avoid wringing it.
Dry it out of direct sunlight.
Iron with a low heat. Place a thin towel over the top of it until it sits flat.;
, Note that the embroidery work can alter the shape of the fabric. If you are embroidering the entire pattern piece (not just portions of it), it is wise to cut out the pattern shape wider in size than the pattern requires or suggests. This will provide you with plenty of additional give, and you can cut and reshape the fabric after embroidering it, to achieve the perfect shape.
 This liquid fabric treatment can be obtained from craft or fabric stores; it will wash out when the embroidery work is completed. Only treat the area that will be embroideredâ€“there is no need to treat the entire piece of fabric with the stabilizer. Use a paintbrush to apply, or a spray applicator and follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Once treated, leave the tulle to dry out of direct sunlight. Iron flat, as noted above.
 It is important to test the embroidery on the tulle before proceeding with the real project. This will give you a good idea of the quality, strength, etc., of the fabric and yarn, and will indicate to you whether more preparation of the cotton net tulle is required. If the fabric does not retain its stiffness across an entire test piece, you will need start preparing it again.
 Follow the instructions provided.
Allow to dry.
Cut close to the embroidery carefully. If treated with a non-fraying product, the stitches won't come undone if you accidentally nick it.

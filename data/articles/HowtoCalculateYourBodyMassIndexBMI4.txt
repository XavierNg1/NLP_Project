 Your BMI is important because it can help you to determine if you are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.A BMI below 18.5 means that you are underweight.
A BMI of 18.6 to 24.9 is healthy.
A BMI of 25 to 29.9 means that you are overweight.
A BMI of 30 or greater indicates obesity.
 In some situations, your BMI may need to be above a certain number if you want to have bariatric surgery. For example, to qualify for bariatric surgery in the UK, you would need to have a BMI of at least 35 if you do not have diabetes and a BMI of at least 30 if you do have diabetes., You can also use your BMI to help you track changes in your weight over time. For example, if you want to chart your weight loss, then calculating your BMI on a regular basis might be helpful. Or, if you want to track growth in yourself or in a child, then calculating and tracking BMI is another way to do that.
 A person with a BMI under 25 is considered to have a healthy body weight. However, if you have a higher than normal muscle percentage, your BMI might be higher. In that case, a BMI higher than 25 may not necessarily indicate that you are overweight. If you are muscled, consider getting skin fold testing to determine whether you have too much fat.


Along with skin fold tests, underwater weighing, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioelectrical impedance are some of the other options available for determining your body's fat content. Just keep in mind that these methods are more expensive and invasive than calculating BMI.

 Written language is the best system humans have ever devised for transmitting knowledge.Naturally, your teachers will want you to show what you’ve learned. In English and Social Studies classes, you do most of your learning by reading--so these are the most common classes to read aloud in. However, you can be asked to read something for the class in any subject, even gym. Try to accept this, and prepare for it instead of dreading it.;
, The best way to look prepared is to be prepared. If you’ve read a passage even once, you’ll have a much better grasp of it than someone who’s never looked at it before. Better yet, read the passage through twice, reading quietly to yourself the second time, if you think you might be called on soon.



Take good notes. You’ll retain information even better once you’ve written it down.
Look up unfamiliar words. If you’re reading out loud and get stuck on a big word you didn’t know before, it can break your flow and mess up your confidence., If you have extra time one day, bring your textbook to the nearest reflective surface and read out loud to yourself. You’ll be able to check your own posture, and even practice looking up to make eye contact with yourself., If you have a study buddy, take turns reading important passages to one another. Take breaks to offer constructive feedback. Does your friend not know what to look for? Check in with these questions:


Was your voice clear enough? Did it sound timid or confident?
Does your body language help you seem more prepared? Are you slouching or standing tall?
Were there any glaring mistakes (like skipped lines or extremely mispronounced words)?

, Reading out loud can be stressful, and you probably want to do a good job. Still, no one expects you to sound like you’re part of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Don’t sweat it if you don’t sound flawless. Just do your best.

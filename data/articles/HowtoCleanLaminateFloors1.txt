 Sweep a dry dust mop across the surface of the floor every few days to remove everyday dirt.Even though laminate flooring is fairly scratch-resistant, excess dirt, hair, and debris can cause scratches to develop if allowed to build up over time. Regular sweeping prevents such scratches from forming.
Instead of using a dry dust mop, you could also use a vacuum with a soft brush attachment.
Do not use a standard floor brush. The stiff, straw-like bristles on the brush could damage the surface.
Sweep in the direction that the laminate floor tiles were laid. Doing so allows you to pick up any debris that falls in between the grooves of the laminate flooring pieces.;
, Use a cloth or sponge to immediately clean up any liquid spills.









Do not allow any liquid, even water, to sit on the floor for prolonged periods. Liquid can stain or damage the protective wear layer of the laminate flooring.
Soak up excess liquid with a dry cloth.
Dampen the cloth or sponge before spot-cleaning the location of the spill to remove any remaining residue.
Dry the spot with a dry, soft cloth. Do not allow the area to remain wet.

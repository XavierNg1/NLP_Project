 Make it a habit to turn your air conditioner off while letting the fan blow a few minutes before you reach any destination. Try to do this about three to five minutes before turning off your engine. Letting the fan blow a few minutes after turning off the A/C will help dry your vent system, preventing mold growth., Never let anything collect around your A/C intakes. Brush away debris weekly, or more often if necessary. Leaves and other debris that accumulates around the windshield cowling are a leading cause of mold growth in the A/C vent system., Every two or three months, choose a warm, dry day to clear out your A/C vents using the fan blower. Open all the car doors, make sure the A/C is off, and turn the blower on max. Regularly drying out your vent systems using this technique will prevent future mold growth.

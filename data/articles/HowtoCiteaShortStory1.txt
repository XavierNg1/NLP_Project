 Each in-text citation should include the last name of the author who wrote the short story and the page number from which you obtained the quoted or summarized information.


Typically, both pieces of information are included in a set parentheses placed directly after the borrowed information and before any punctuation:


Example: In “Sample Story,” the protagonist embarks on a figurative journey into her childhood (Doe 41).


If you note the author's name within the same sentence, however, only the page number must still appear within the parentheses.


Example: In Doe's “Sample Story,” the protagonist embarks on a figurative journey into her childhood (41).

;
, Begin the citation with the last name of the story's author, followed by the first name. The title of the short story follows after that.Example: Doe, John. "Sample Story."

, If you found the short story in an anthology of works, you need to name and italicize the title of the anthology. Name the editor, as well.



Example: Doe, John. "Sample Story." A Collection of Stories. Ed. Jane Smith.
If the anthology was written and edited by the author of the short story, you do not need to include a reference to the editor.
 The citation should conclude with information about the publisher, including the publication city, the publisher's name, and the year in which the anthology was published (not the original publication date of the story).


For print works, you should also cite the page numbers used and conclude the entire citation with the word "Print."


Example: Doe, John. "Sample Story." A Collection of Stories. Ed. Jane Smith. Palo Alto: WikiHow Publishing, 2015. 41-45. Print.


For online works, you should cite the name of the website and conclude the entire citation with the word "Web," along with the access date.Example: Doe, John. "Sample Story." A Collection of Stories. Ed. Jane Smith. Palo Alto: WikiHow Publishing, 2015. WikiHow. Web. 27 Aug. 2015.

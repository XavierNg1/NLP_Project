 Gboard is a custom keyboard that enables integrated Google Search and Android-style glide typing. Search for Gboard in the App Store and press “Get” to install. Upon launching, follow the explicit instructions displayed to get set up.;
, Launch the Gboard app and tap "Search Settings". A list of settings for Google Search will appear.
 Predictive search will suggest searches to perform in Google based on what you’ve types into your message. For example, if you write a text to someone asking if they want to get tacos, a predictive suggestion will appear to search for tacos in your area.
 This allows Gboard to access your contacts list while searching. This way contact information can be shared directly from the search without having to switch apps.
 Tapping this will prompt you to allow Gboard to use your location when performing searches.


Unlike most other Gboard settings, location and contacts settings can be accessed in the iOS settings under Gboard once toggled. They must be toggled in Gboard first before the options will appear in iOS settings.
 Tap this to remove your previous searches from appearing in your history or predictive suggestions when searching with Gboard.

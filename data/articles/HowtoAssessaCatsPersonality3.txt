 If you’ve just recently moved the cat to a new environment – a new home or an animal shelter, for instance – give it time to acclimate to the environment. Most animals will be skittish and anxious when they first arrive in an unfamiliar place. In order to accurately determine what sort of personality the cat has, wait at least a day or two for it to calm down., You can put the cat at ease by housing it in a clean, quiet room, and using a cage that has plenty of room to move around. Since cats are fearful when trapped and looked down upon, house the cage at waist level or above. Play some soft music for the cat, and allow the cat to look out into the room to see human activity. Keep other cats away, unless they are of the opposite gender of the cat whose personality you wish to assess., During physical examinations, cats are prodded and turned over. They might receive shots or have their blood drawn. These experiences will alarm and stress your cat, making it difficult to accurately assess the cat’s baseline personality. Therefore, assessing your cat’s personality while it is receiving a physical exam is not a good idea., Don’t try to assess cats who are sick or injured. When cats are sick or injured, they will be less responsive and might act in novel and unpredictable ways. Therefore, wait until sick or injured cats are healed before assessing their personalities.For the same reason, don’t try to assess the personality of a cat in heat.

 The power pack should be on a flat, level surface. Plug the power pack into an outlet. This will provide a steady supply of power to your circuit. Plug the wire leads into the power pack., Screw the light into a bulb holder. Then connect each lead from the power pack to one of the terminals on the bulb holder. Once both leads are connected, the light will light up.If the light does not light up, check that the leads are well connected and the power pack is plugged in and turned on.
 You can turn a dial on your power pack to cause the voltage to fluctuate. Doing this can demonstrate how the brightness of the light changes as a result of higher or lower voltages. The light should get dimmer as the voltage goes down, and brighter as the voltage goes up.

 An example of saying grace is: "Dear Lord, I'd like to thank you for my family, friends, home, and this banquet that has been set before us today." Saying grace doesn't mean, "GRACE!!!" Saying grace means giving thanks to the Lord for everything you have.;
, If you've eaten at least 3 pounds on past Thanksgivings, try to eat less than 2 lbs, but more than 1/2 pound. It is healthier that way.
 If one drumstick (turkey leg) is 150 calories, eat two. That is 300 calories. Then think about the pumpkin pie, if 1 slice is 80 calories, eat two. 300 plus 160 is 460. If one small squirt of whipped cream is 20 calories, put one medium-sized squirt it on top of your pumpkin pie. That one meal is 500 calories (because of the medium-sized squirt of whipped cream).
 Maybe a serving of fruit, cut vegetables, or crackers will hold you for a little while into the feast.
 This will decrease the chance of you eating half the turkey and six slices of pumpkin pie. Talking burns the calories you're taking in. Remember, calories are burnt by every single little movement.
 You can only do something this big once a year, so don't miss out!

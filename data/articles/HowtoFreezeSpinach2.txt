 Fill one or more freezer-safe plastic bags with as much clean spinach as possible. Squeeze out any excess air, then seal the bags.Don't be afraid of packing the spinach too tightly. Tight packing is actually recommended since it leaves less room for excess air.
You could also use freezer-safe plastic storage bins, but these do not work quite as well since you won't be able to remove quite as much excess air from the container prior to sealing it.;
, Place the spinach in your freezer. It should remain edible for around six months.


When you're ready to use it, thaw the spinach in your refrigerator for several hours. Squeeze any excess moisture out of the thawed leaves before using or consuming them.
The cell membranes will break down during frozen storage, making thawed spinach too soft to eat raw, but you can still add it to smoothies and cooked recipes.

 The right personality should be intellectual, morose and philosophical. It's important to have a dark aesthetic. A large vocabulary and a high level of intelligence are important.
 Be known for devouring book after book, preferably classic horror books such as Dracula and dark fantasy (anything by Anne Rice). Some high level reading is great too. Dystopian science fiction is amazing. Avoid utopian science fiction and happy fantasy, however.


If you want to go the extra mile, memorize "The Raven" By Edgar Allen Poe.
 Try to memorize the lines to Nosferatu, Dracula, and any other old horror flick. At the very least, know their stories very well.
 Listen to goth, dark cabaret, post-punk, horror-punk, shock-rock, metal, dark ambient,and classical music. The best metals are death metal, gothic metal, doom metal, neo-classical metal, symphonic metal, ambient black metal, symphonic black metal, blackened death metal and black doom. Classical music is best if it is melancholy. You can also try history inspired music such as Medieval Babes and Rasputina.
 Learn to play either guitar, keyboard, piano or violin. Practice a lot. If you get good, join a metal, dark cabaret or Gothic band. You can also just focus on classical music if you want.
 Not only should you read a lot, but you should write your own poems and stories to add to your ghost persona.
 Try dadaism, pointillism, romanticism, neoclassicism, impressionism, and expressionism. Anything dark or depressing is great, too.

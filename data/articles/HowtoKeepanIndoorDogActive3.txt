 Dogs need to go outside to eliminate and exercise. You should aim to walk your dog for at least thirty minutes a day. This can be broken up into two fifteen minute sessions, one in the morning and one in the evening.


If you cannot walk your dog during the day, you may want to hire a professional dog walker., Agility classes are a fun activity you can do with your dog. These classes will teach your dog how to run through an obstacle course while you give directions. The activities keep your dogâ€™s mental and physical skills sharp.You can ask your vet if they know of any good classes, or you may speak to a dog trainer for more information.
 Some areas have special, indoor heated pools for dogs. If your dog can swim, this may be a good activity to keep them active, especially in the winter when long walks may not be an option.Dogs with short noses, like pekingese and English bulldogs, should not go swimming., If your dog cannot leave your home for full walks, you may want to invest in a dog treadmill. These are specially designed to help dogs exercise indoors. These treadmills can be ordered online, or you can talk to your vet.

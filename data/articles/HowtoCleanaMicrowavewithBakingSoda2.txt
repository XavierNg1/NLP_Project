 Mix two tablespoons (30ml) of baking soda with one cup (237ml) of water. Pour the mixture into a microwaveable container and leave it unsealed.
 As the solution warms and steams, the baking soda will absorb odors from the microwave. The steam will clean the walls of the microwave, loosening any lodged foods and oils.









Let the container stand in the microwave for 15 minutes., The container will likely be very hot to the touch, use oven mitts to avoid burning yourself.









Pour the contents of the container down the sink.
 Dampen a lint-free cloth with water. Wipe along the microwave’s walls and its top. This will remove any traces of baking soda that may have collected on its walls.








If you’re really concerned about the cleanliness of the turntable and support ring, you can remove them from the microwave and wipe them down separately.
 If you don’t have enough time to let the microwave air dry, you can wipe the inside down with a towel.

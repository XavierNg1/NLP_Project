 The individual cells have no intrinsic meaning; the meaning changes depending on which Braille system you are reading. However, knowing where the dots and empty spaces are is important to being able to read Braille. Braille printed for the sighted may have "shadow dots" in the empty spaces; Braille for the blind will not have these.
 These letters use only the the top 4 dots of the 6 in the cell.
 These are identical to letters A through J, except they have an additional dot in position 3.
 These are the same as letters A through E, except they have an extra dot in positions 1, 3 and 6.
 W is out of order because Braille was written originally in French, which at that time did not contain the letter W.
 Pay extra attention to the Braille special symbols. These aren't found in regular print. They are used to distinguish capital letters and other formatting not apparent in the Braille cells.
 Braille Through Remote Learning has an excellent list and search feature.
 Learning Braille is just like learning any other alphabet. You won't pick it up overnight, but it is by no means impossible.

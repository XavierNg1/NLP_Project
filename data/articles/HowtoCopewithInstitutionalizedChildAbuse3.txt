 You may always feel like there is someone that will try to take you back to the "place," but you will be safe. If you feel safe talking to your parents or guardians, explain to them what happened.
 You may experience nightmares, flashbacks, inability to relax, and other symptoms of trauma. A trained therapist can help minimize these effects so you can feel okay again.


Your family doctor can recommend a good therapist.
Ask your family for a doctor's appointment. Then tell your doctor about what happened to you, and how you are coping now.
 You are not the only one who has escaped institutional abuse. Meeting others with similar experiences can help you process what happened to you, and you can share coping tips with each other.
 It is okay to be you, and there is nothing fundamentally wrong with your identity. Find support from the LGBTQIA community, join a religious group of your chosen religion, or network with the disability community. You have the right to be yourself. Meeting people like you can help you move on.
 Do you like to paint, write, swim, program? Join a club about your hobby, or try a new activity. Figure out which skills you want to cultivate and focus on them.
 Reach out to family, friends, and other people around you. You're facing troubles that no person should have to face. You don't have to deal with it alone.

The ring finger is the weakest finger, making it ideal for the delicate skin under your eyes.

If the cream comes in a jar, then scoop out a small amount using a small spoon or scoop. This will prevent your fingers from contaminating the product inside the jar. You can find scoops at most beauty supply stores.
 Dab the cream onto your face in small dots. Focus on trouble areas, such as the cheeks and forehead. Avoid areas that tend to get very oily, such as the creases to either side of your nostrils.


If you have combination skin, focus more on the dry areas and less on the oily areas.
 Gently massage the cream into your skin using small, upward, circular motions. Never drag downward on your skin. Be sure to leave a Â½ inch (1.27 centimeter) margin around your eyes. Most face creams are not suitable for the delicate, sensitive skin around your eyes.

 Look over your face carefully. If you notice any clumps or lumps of cream, gently dab those off using a tissue. This is excess cream.
 During this time, you can do your hair or brush your teeth. You can also start putting on your lower garments, such as underwear, socks, pants, and skirts. This way, you won't risk rubbing off your face cream and getting it on everything else.

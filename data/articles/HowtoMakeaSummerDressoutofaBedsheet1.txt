 You will measure most accurately if you are unclothed.


Measure your waist by wrapping a vinyl tape measure around it.
Measure the distance from your waist to where you want the hem of the skirt to fall. For example, measure just above or just below your knee depending on your preferred skirt length.
Check the distance from your waist to your shoulder.
Wrap the tape measure around the widest part of your bust.;
, If the fabric is sheer, then plan to use 2 layers of fabric for your dress. Alternatively, use the sheet and a second lining fabric such as white cotton.
 Choose white or a neutral color that will blend in with the fabric.



Use the seam ripper to cut every second or third stitch. Then, use your fingers, not the seam ripper, to pull out the threads.
If you're using a fitted sheet, fold the sheet into quarters and cut off the elastic around the perimeter.
 If the unpicked stitches left large holes in the fabric, then trim the edge off of the bedsheet so that the holes don't look unattractive when you're wearing the dress. Save the fabric and use it to make ties for the dress later.

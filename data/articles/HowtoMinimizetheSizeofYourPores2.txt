 Since makeup contributes to clogged pores, you need a protective layer of moisturizer between the makeup and your skin. Apply a light, natural moisturizer, and let your face absorb it for a few minutes before proceeding.
 Depending on your skin type, you might want to choose a matte or glossy concealer. Make sure it matches your skin tone, and apply it using a cotton ball.









Don't be tempted to use too much concealer in an effort to hide your pores. Caking makeup on will only draw more attention to areas you're trying to minimize.
Experiment with different brands. Some concealers may not work for your individual skin type. If one concealer seems to dry out your face or make your pores look bigger, try another one.
 A light application of powder over concealer can make pores appear much smaller. Wait until the concealer has set before using a blush or bronzer brush to lightly dust powder over your face.

 This includes items you may carry in your pockets such as pens, keys, or small pistols.;
, Clenched fists give away your readiness to strike. Open hands present a non-threatening appearance that will cause an attacker to let his guard down, while still leaving you the options to suddenly strike or grab.
 Screaming may draw attention and scare the attacker away.
 What use is any other defense tactic if you get knocked out?

, To form the hand for a palm-heel strike, bend the wrist back at a 90 degree angle and spread and claw the fingers. For an edge of hand blow, straighten the fingers and press them together, and strike with the muscle in the side of the hand. When striking down into an assailant's face, clench the fist and strike with the little finger side. Closed fist punches rely on wrist strength and stability to deliver a proper strike, and the knuckles are easily broken in the confusion of a fight.
 These areas are easy to hit and will probably knock the enemy down for your chance to escape. Remember that a heavy strike to a person's face is highly effective at making them lose their senses. A broken nose or strike to the eyes will greatly hinder your opponent's ability to observe and react. Do not strike a person in the mouth--this will damage your hand.
 So can headbutting.
 The eyes and throat are especially vulnerable areas.
 Instead, use your knee repeatedly.
 Not only could this cause their nose to bleed, but it will cause their eyes to water, giving you a chance of escape.
 If an attacker gets a hold of you and doesn't have a firearm pointed to your head or a knife to your neck, squirm. Squirming and pinching the attacker can help you get out of his or her clutches. If the attacker has a weapon, keep it away from you.
 Kicking the jaw off of an unconscious person isn't self defense, it's a lack of self control.

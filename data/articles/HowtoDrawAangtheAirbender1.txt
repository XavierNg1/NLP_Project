 These will serve as the basis for Aang's body, which is similar to that of a real twelve-year-old boy.;
, You will now be able to see the shape of the body a little better.
 The top part of the fabric should conform to the shoulders, falling and overlapping itself like a curtain.
 Continue drawing the rest of Aang's clothing. Aang has pants that fold below his knees, while his boots conform to the shape of his lower legs and feet.
 It should look like a simple stick, since he isn't using it to fly around right now. Don't forget the diamond forms on either side of the weapon. Make sure your lines are straight and steady.
 Follow the guidelines to place his eyes, nose, mouth, and forehead markings properly. Aang has huge, anime-esque eyes, as well as a wide and childish smile.
 Don't forget the arrows on his hands! Once you've finished detailing, remove the guidelines to clean it up.
 All you need to do now is clean up the lines and close any gaps. Make sure that there are no remaining guidelines. You can also color Aang in, if you wish.

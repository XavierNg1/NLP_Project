 Don’t skip practicing regular cartwheels and move straight on to aerials. Knowing how to Do a Cartwheel effortlessly will strengthen your sense of balance and coordination, which is essential in your training. Keep practicing until you feel like you can do a cartwheel in your sleep!








A regular cartwheel is the foundation for an aerial cartwheel, and if you don’t feel 100% comfortable doing it, you won’t be successful in learning an aerial cartwheel.
 After you have mastered the regular cartwheel, learn how to Do a One-Handed Cartwheel. A one-handed cartwheel brings you one step closer to your goal and will teach you how to momentum your energy through the cartwheel without using both of your hands.








When you practice one handed cartwheels, switch off between your right and left hands. This will prevent you from becoming dependent on one of your hands for the stunt.
 Once you feel comfortable doing one-handed cartwheels, practice doing them and wait until the last possible moment to put down your hand as you flip.









This will stop you from using your hand as a crutch so that you get used to the feeling of moving upside down in the air without your hands supporting you.
 Dynamic stretches are extremely important if you are starting to learn aerials and other tricks. Dynamic stretches differ from regular stretches because instead of stretching and holding a position, dynamic stretches require you to stretch your muscles through a series of quick movements.Because dynamic stretches mimic the quick motions your body goes through as you do aerials or other tricks, doing these stretches before training minimizes the chance of pulling a muscle or hurting yourself.
Examples of dynamic stretches include leg lifts and kicks, body twists and side bends.

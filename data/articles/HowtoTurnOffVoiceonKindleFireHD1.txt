 Since using one finger will simply prompt your Kindle's voice to read aloud whatever you touched, you'll have to use two fingers to scroll, and anything you would typically tap once you will need to tap twice., It's toward the bottom of the Settings menu., It's at the top of the page.

 This is the top option on the page. Doing so will disable the Kindle Fire's Screen Reader, which will prevent your Kindle from reading aloud the items you touch on-screen.

On some Kindles, this option may be called "Voice Guide" instead of "Screen Reader".

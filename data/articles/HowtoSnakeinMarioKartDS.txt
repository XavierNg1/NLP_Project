 The mini turbo is the basis of snaking, and when you condense it all down, all snaking really is, is enhanced use of it. First, when going around a corner, press and hold "R" to begin drifting. This allows you to take on corners without losing speed. Next, to perform the mini-turbo, press on of the arrows on the D Pad (what you use to steer) back and forth to make the sparks under the back wheels turn blue, and subsequently red. Once they are red, let go for a mini-turbo. It gives you a small speed boost.;
, On long turns, use the mini-turbo over and over to maintain a high speed. In doing this, you are almost snaking, and already using the concept of it to your advantage. Because you're still turning in a certain direction, this is a good way to get comfortable with mini-turbos. Try to fit as many mini-turbos into a turn as possible to further prepare yourself for actually snaking.
 A good course for this is Figure-8 Circuit due to its long, straight, and decently wide track. Do a mini turbo just as you would on a turn. Then once it has been completed, let go of R and quickly steer your car towards the opposite way you were drifting, and hold down R again and do another mini-turbo. If you've done this, you're snaking! Just learn to use more and more in a row until you feel good about it. Once you have been doing it a lot, it becomes second nature and without even thinking you'll suddenly be able to defeat even some of the best online racers.
 If you thought snaking was all about technique, think again. Your kart has a huge impact on how well you snake. Choose a light kart with good acceleration for the best results. Dry Bones karts "Dry Bomber" and "Standard DB" are famous online for their superior snaking abilities. Avoid using heavy karts.

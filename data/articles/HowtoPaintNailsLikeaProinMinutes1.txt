 Not all polishes are created equal. Some have potentially harmful chemicals, and others just look downright bad. There are a number of things to keep in mind.


Use a B3F, or “3 free” nail polish and base/top coat. These polishes contain no formaldehyde, DBP, or toluene, and are becoming a standard in the industry. They are safer than polishes that contain these chemicals.Glittery polish lasts longer.When looking for white nail polish, find one that is thick and creamy, not opaque.
Quick-dry nail polish can be convenient, but it tends to dry out your nails.;
, Position the file between your skin and your nail, and move it in short, sharp strokes in one direction. Never file back and forth., Push them down with a wooden cuticle pusher, but never cut your cuticles.Soften them with cuticle cream or olive oil. Apply petroleum jelly to your cuticles and the skin around your nails to protect them from polish.
 Use a buffer to buff your nails gently in one direction, in small strokes. Work from cuticle to tip. Use a nail cleaner to remove any dirt from under your nails, and wash them with soap and warm water., Roll the nail polish container between your hands to mix the contents together. Do not shake it, as this creates bubbles that make application a challenge.

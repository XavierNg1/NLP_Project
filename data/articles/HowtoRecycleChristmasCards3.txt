 Check that the images will fit the gift or bottle bag without being too large.
 Then carefully glue it in place on the gift bag. Allow to dry before use.
 Keep a selection of nice card images in a box. When wrapping your next round of Christmas gifts, glue these onto the wrapped object for adding the final festive touch. (This will only work once the gift has been wrapped.)

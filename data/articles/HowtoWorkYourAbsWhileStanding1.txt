 Keep your feet together with one heel lifted. Keep your hands behind your head. Your back should be straight, with knees slightly bent.


It doesn’t matter which heel you lift. This is just the leg you will be picking up first.;
, If you are starting with the right leg, lift your knee up towards the left shoulder. The left knee should go towards the right shoulder.


Your knee should reach up to about the height of your hips. Any higher and you might fall over., Twist your torso so that your knee goes to your elbow.


Squeeze your abs tightly as you make this move. You want to make sure it emphasizes those muscles to get the most work. Observe caution while twisting your back. If something hurts in your back, reduce your range of motion and proceed slowly only if it feels safe.
Make sure your hands stay behind your head, which keeps your elbows pointed outwards.Don’t worry if you can’t reach without bending your back and possibly losing your balance. Your knee and elbow don’t need to touch. The important thing is that the knee and elbow are reaching towards the same point.
 Put your leg back down to the ground. Stand up straight again as well.
 Do the same steps, just with your other leg. Alternate between your right and left legs.


You can also do a series of reps (try 20), with one leg before switching to the other leg. Just remember to do the same number of reps with each leg to keep consistent.

 For example: As Elizabeth Barrett Browning said in her sonnet.
 This may be more dramatic, especially if the author is not as well known and the words themselves are more powerful than the poet.
 Even if you read the whole poem as part of a speech, reference it again if you borrow a line or phrase later in your speech.

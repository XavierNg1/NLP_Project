 Corn fufu, also called ugali, is one of the many types of fufu that you can make. As the name suggests, itâ€™s made by combining boiling water and corn, in the form of cornmeal.

Add the full amount of water to a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the salt, and bring the water to a boil over medium heat.
When the water boils, remove 1 cup (237 ml) of the water and set it aside. Keep the rest of the water on the heat.;
, Slowly pour the cornmeal into the pot of water, whisking constantly as you add it. Once all the cornmeal has been added and incorporated, switch to a wooden spoon and continue stirring the mixture.Once all the cornmeal has been stirred in, turn the heat to low.
 Stir the cornmeal vigorously with the wooden spoon to prevent it from burning. If any lumps form, remove the pan from the heat momentarily to stir out the lumps, then return the pan to the heat.

As the mixture heats up, the starch in the cornmeal will thicken the mixture. This will take about five to 10 minutes.
When the mixture is ready, it will start to smell like roasted corn., Once the fufu has thickened, add the reserved cup of water back into the pot. Stir to combine, then put the lid on the pot. Let the fufu cook for 10 to 15 minutes.When the cooking time is up, remove the pan from the heat.
 Use a ladle or small bowl to portion out the fufu. Use your hands to shape the fufu into a ball before serving.

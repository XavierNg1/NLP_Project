 Of course, you want to honor your loved one in the best way possible. However, you should also realize your limits. If the pain is still fresh and you don't want to break down at your wedding, seriously think about what will make you overly emotional and what won't. For instance, having a moment of silence or prayer for your loved one may make you more emotional than including a photo of your loved one., Your tribute to your loved one doesn't have to be for everyone else. It can be just for you, such as a necklace that person gave you. On the other hand, it can be very public, such as a moment of silence. It all depends on what you want.Similarly, you can also think how the person would feel about a public or private tribute, and honor them by giving them what they would have liked most.
 Even if you have a more private tribute, you can have a note in the program about the tribute. For instance, if you have flowers dedicated to your loved one on the altar, you could write a short note about it in the program.For example, it could say, "The flowers on the altar are in loving memory of the bride's mother, Rebekah Jones."

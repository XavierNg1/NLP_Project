 Since deer's natural food source is made up from woody vegetation, it becomes harder for them to find food during the winter. This is the reason many people choose to feed deer. If you decide to feed deer during the winter months, be careful to feed them the proper types of food and slowly introduce it into their diets.


Begin introducing food slowly so that it does not harm the deer. Begin combine supplemental food with their natural diet of woody vegetation. This combination of new food into their natural diet will provide a smooth transition for their digestive tracks.
Set up feeders or troughs in your yard. Set the feeders or troughs up as far away from your home as possible.
If you have the means, you can keep your feeders or troughs full at all times. If not, you should stick to a set feeding time. The deer will become accustomed to eating your food, so try to keep the feeding on a regular schedule. Early morning or sunset are good times for feeding.
 Many people choose to supply deer with food only during the winter months, as this is when their natural food sources are the most scarce. But if you have the means, consider providing supplemental food to your deer year round. This will allow deer to adapt to the supplemental food so that it doesn't shock their system. This will also teach dear to combine their supplemental and natural food sources.
 When deer are fed by humans, they can easily become dependent and stop foraging for food naturally. If you feed deer and then suddenly stop (even if you've simply run out of food temporarily), the deer may go hungry or start bothering you for more food.


You should slowly wean deer off of supplemental food so that they can begin foraging for food on their own again. Take the food away slowly and not all at once.

 This style is generally well suited to heart, round, and square shaped faces with medium texture hair or thicker. Apply a light hairspray to your hair to assist with styling, and use a large barrel curling iron to curl your hair from the middle of your hair to the ends.


When you have completed curling, use your fingers to create some separation between your curls.
Keep your fringe straight.
Set the look with a light hold hairspray.
 Take your favorite scarf and place it around the front of your head so that its ends lay at the nape of your neck about Â½" away from your hairline. Now divide your hair into three strands, with the outer two being somewhat smaller than the middle one.


Collect your scarf along with the outer strands of your hair.
Cross your left strand over the middle so that it becomes the new middle section, then cross the right strand over the new middle strand.
Repeat this motion until the braid is complete.
Knot the ends of your scarf to complete the look., Short, fine hair framing an oval, square, or round face should work well with this cut. Use a light volumizing mousse in your dry, ready to style hair, and use a blow dryer and paddle brush to give your hair a sleek appearance.


Create a deep part on the side of your head.
With light hold gel or wax, style the left side of your deep part so that it is smooth.
Move on to the crown of your head and, using your styling product, fluff and spike the back of your hair.
 Make a deep side part in your hair that reaches all the way to the nape of your neck. Clip the side with more hair so that it is out of your way and brush the other side. Now you can tie the shorter side under the longer tightly with an elastic.Free the side with more hair and apply some strong-hold mousse.
Blow dry while using a round brush upward to give your hair dramatic volume.

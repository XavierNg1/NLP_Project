 The bag will trap moisture released by the plants. This moisture will then drip back down onto the plants, watering them. The bag must be clear in order to allow sunlight to pass through.
 The towel will help the plants retain moisture and prevent the soil from getting too dry.
 Only put in as many plants as you can fit. The leaves should just barely be touching each other. If the leaves are getting cramped, get another bag.
 You can tie the bag shut with a rubber band or twist tie. For extra security, fold the tied part of the bag down, and wrap another rubber band around it., You can keep them indoors or outdoors, but make sure that they are out of direct sunlightâ€”partial sunlight is fine, however. If you keep your plants in direct sunlight, they well get cooked due to the trapped heat., If the plants are too big to fit inside of a plastic bag, simply line your bathtub with a plastic sheet and several newspapers. Place the plants on top, water them until the newspapers get soaked, and close the shower curtains.Leave the light on, if you can.

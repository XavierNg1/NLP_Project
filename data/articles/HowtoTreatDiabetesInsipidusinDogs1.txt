 A dog with diabetes insipidus who is denied water will initially be agitated and restless, as he seeks water but can't find any. As he becomes dehydrated there are relatively few warning signs, unless you specifically look for things such as dry gums and test his scruff for hydration.


Unfortunately, if the dehydration is undetected the blood supply to major organs will be reduced and those organs (of which the kidneys are especially sensitive) will go into failure. The first signs of this could be vomiting and collapse.;
, There should be moisture present; if the gums are dry this could point to early dehydration.
 You can also use your dog’s skin as a way to check for dehydration. Lift the scuff of skin located in between his shoulders; lift it away from his body and then release it. A well hydrated dog’s skin will fall back into place immediately.


A dog who is dehydrated will have skin that “tents”, which means that after you release it, it stays peaked and very slowly returns to its original position.

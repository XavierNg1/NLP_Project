 Press and hold the Power button located at the top-right corner of the reader to turn it on.
 Once the reader is switched on, get the USB cable included in the package when you purchased it and connect the smaller end to the micro USB port located at the bottom of the reader. Take the other end of the cable and plug it to any USB port on your computer.
 Once your Mac detects the Kobo reader, a shortcut icon labeled “KOBOeReader” will appear on your desktop. Double-click on this icon to open and view its contents.
 Inside Kobo’s file folder, you’ll find the Desktop Installer folder, which contains the installer for the Kobo Desktop application for computers. Open Desktop Installer and inside you’ll see another folder named Mac OS X.


Open the Mac OS X folder and inside you’ll find a Mac installer file named Desktop Installer.
 Double-click on the Desktop Installer file to create a Kobo disc image on the desktop.
 Click on the Finder app from the Application Dock on the bottom part of the screen to open it. On the Finder window, click on “Applications” listed below “Places” on the left menu panel, then click and drag the Kobo disc image on the desktop inside the Applications folder.


You can now open the Kobo Desktop application on your Mac computer by launching it from the Applications folder.
Your Kobo is all set, and you can now start copying e-books and documents to your Kobo reader using the desktop application.

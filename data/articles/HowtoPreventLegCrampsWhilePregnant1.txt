 Leg cramps are a sudden tightening of the muscles, which can cause intense pain. Stretching has been shown to be one of the most reliable ways of preventing or relieving leg cramping. Focus on stretches for your calves and feet, and make sure to stretch before bed, as well as before and after exercise. Avoid any stretches that require you to lay on your back. Try some of the following basic leg stretches:


Seated calf stretch: Gather 2 chairs and a scarf or towel. Sit down on 1 chair and place a foot on the second. Wrap the towel or scarf around the ball of your foot. Begin pulling the towel or scarf towards you. You should feel the stretch in the muscles of your calf and in your foot. Stay in this position 30 seconds and switch legs.
Standing calf stretch: Stand on a flat surface wearing shoes with a firm grip, about 2 to 3 feet (.61 to .91 m) in front of a wall. Lift your arms in front of you and set your hands on the wall. Slowly lean forward until you feel the stretch in your calf muscles. To finish the stretch, walk your hands back up the wall until you are standing straight.;

 Click “Sign In” at the top right corner of the screen and enter your login information.


If you’re already signed in, you’ll see your Google profile image at the top right corner of Google+.
 The menu will expand.
, If you have contacts in Gmail, this is how you can locate their Google+ profiles. A list of your Gmail Contacts will appear, containing links to their Google+ profiles.


If you’ve ever been active on Google+, you can also try clicking “Have You in Circles” at the top of the page. Both options will display a list of user profiles.
If you’re looking for a specific friend, you could search for their name in the search box at the top of the page. It may help to add the city they live in, for example: “Michael Jackson, Santa Maria.”

 If this person has posted public videos to YouTube, they will now appear beneath the header. Notice that it says “’s YouTube videos” next to the red YouTube symbol just below the header.

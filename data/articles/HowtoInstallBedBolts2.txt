 Some frames will have a tab you settle a nub from the bed rail into.


This should align the bolt holes in the rail and end piece, making them ready for your bolt.
 Position the bolt so the flat head of the bolt is on the outside of the bed frame. Otherwise, the protruding end of the bolt will snag whoever uses the bed.
 Hand-tighten the nut until you can't tighten it further without tools.
 Simultaneously tighten the nut using the hex wrench. Tighten until the joint no longer wobbles when shaken with one hand.

 When you make cold-brew, you avoid diluting your coffee with ice cubes or letting hot coffee sit out and get cold, which ruins its flavor.Cold brewed coffee has less acidity than traditionally made coffee, and less bitterness., Stir them until there are no lumps left in the coffee. You should aim for roughly 4.5 times more water than coffee, so if you want 8 cups of coffee, use 8 cups water and 1.5 cups of grounds.If you grind your own coffee, grind it as finely as you can. This is best for cold-brew., The sugar will dissolve better in warm water and will stay in the drink as it chills. If you try to add sugar to cold coffee the chances are good that you will be left with undissolved sugar at the bottom of your cup.
 If the pitcher has a top, you can also use that instead.
 This is when the coffee actually brews. Because there is no heat involved, it takes much longer to brew than a normal cup off coffee, but the taste is worth it.
 A combination of a filter and mesh strainer should get rid of most grounds in your coffee. Set up the strainer above a bowl, or another pitcher, to catch the coffee.
 The coffee will slowly trickle out the bottom of the strainer and the grounds will remain on top. Pour slowly, and never try to force or press the coffee through the filter. When you are done, throw out the coffee grounds and serve., Simply mix the water and coffee grounds in the pot and put the lid on. Do not push down the plunger. Refrigerate the coffee overnight, then push down the plunger and serve in the morning.

Think multipurpose and multifunction.
If it's not on your list, don't pack it.



Cincinnati is a fairly casual city, but you may go somewhere fancy (symphony? opera?), so bring along one dress-up outfit.
Plan to do laundry if your trip to Cincinnati will last three weeks or more.
 Use every space.


Folding takes up too much space in a suitcase and often adds wrinkles to clothing.
Stick shoes, belts and other rigid items in the outer edge of the suitcase.
 Shoes take up a lot of room in luggage.


Make one a comfortable pair suitable for walking around Cincinnati. Wear the comfortable shoes on any flights as well.
Choose another pair for dress-up occasions.



Pack toiletries in small or travel-size containers.
Trip planning should always include plastic bags, such as Ziploc brand. This keeps toiletries from leaking onto clothing. Plastic bags can later be used for dirty clothes or garbage.
 That way, if the airline loses one suitcase, everyone still has clothing.



This helps in case of loss or robbery.
 Items you might want to keep close include:


Identification, credit cards.
Prescription medication in original containers.
Tickets, travel itinerary and trip planning notes.
Visa or passport if you're coming from outside the U.S.
Jewelry.
Electronic items.
Chewing gum to help your ears if you're flying.

Batteries or chargers.
Guidebooks and maps.
If you're coming from outside the U.S., you may need an electrical adapter and plug converter.

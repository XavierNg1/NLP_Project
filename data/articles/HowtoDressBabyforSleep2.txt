 If the weather is warm, then a blanket may not be necessary, but lightweight blankets are best. Select a lightweight blanket that is made from natural materials, such as cotton, wool, silk, or hemp. Heavy, fluffy blankets are a suffocation hazard for babies, so it is best to avoid these.


Always tuck your baby in if you use a blanket. Make sure that the blanket comes up to your baby’s chest (under your baby’s armpits) and tuck it into the sides and bottom of the mattress.Instead of a blanket, try putting your baby in a sleep sack. This reduces the risk of smothering while keeping your baby comfortable.
 Swaddling is when you wrap your baby in a swaddling blanket so that only your baby’s head is exposed. Swaddling can help a newborn baby sleep better and longer because it simulates a mother’s womb. You can swaddle your baby until she is three to four months old, or longer in some cases. To determine when to stop swaddling your baby, swaddle your baby and leave one arm sticking out. If your baby sleeps well with one arm out, then you may not need to swaddle anymore.To swaddle your baby, lay a lightweight, natural fiber blanket down so that it looks like a diamond from your perspective. Fold down the corner of the blanket that is furthest away from you.
Then, lay your baby in the center of the blanket with her head resting on the folded corner.
Pull one side of the blanket over your baby’s chest.
Then, fold up the bottom of the blanket over your baby’s feet, tucking it up over your baby’s shoulder.
Last, fold over the other side of the blanket across the baby’s chest. Make sure that the swaddling is snug, but not tight.
 If you have a thermostat, then set it for 65°F (18.3°C).


If you do not have a thermostat, consider getting an indoor thermometer to put in your baby’s room. This can help you see if you need to close or open a window, turn up the heat, or turn on the air conditioning.
Keep your baby away from air conditioning vents or drafty windows.

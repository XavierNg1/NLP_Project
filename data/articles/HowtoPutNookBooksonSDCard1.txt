 Install the NOOK software to your PC or Mac computer.


Sign into your NOOK account using the same login information you use on your NOOK device.;
, You cannot directly move files from the NOOK memory to the SD memory using your NOOK. You must use the computer as a proxy to transfer the files between the two storage partitions.


After you have transferred the files you can delete the books from your computer so as not to take up unnecessary memory space.
 Archiving the books will move them off of the memory of your NOOK. You will still have access to these books as a part of the cloud to download later if you wish.You should now have a downloaded copy of the book saved on your computer’s hard drive and not on the memory of the NOOK.
This step prevents you from having two copies of the book on the NOOK memory and SD card memory.
 Use the USB cable that came with the NOOK device to connect the NOOK to the computer.Wait for the computer to recognize that the NOOK has been connected.
Open the Documents folder on your computer where the downloaded e-books are stored.
Open the drive for your NOOK device. You should see two folders, one labeled NOOK for the NOOK memory and another for the SD card.
Click on the folder for the SD card in the NOOK drive window.
 Select the digital files of the books you want to copy to your SD card and copy them onto the SD card memory.You can select multiple files at a time and have the computer copy them all to the SD card, or you can choose books one by one.
 After transferring the files, stop the link between the NOOK and the computer. When the link has been stopped, remove the USB cable connecting the devices.


On a PC, click on the “Safely Remove Hardware” option in the lower right corner of the screen.
Mac users should drag the NOOK drive to the trash to stop the connection.

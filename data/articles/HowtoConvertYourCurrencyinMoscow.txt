Exchange offices can be easily found in post offices, train stations, hotel receptions, on street corners and surrounding large tourism hot spots.

Banks in Moscow are also able to exchange foreign currency as needed. Banking hours are typically from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday. Take notice of their posted exchange rate, as it may vary from bank to bank in your home country and in Moscow.
Count the dispensed rubles and confirm that the conversion has followed the proper exchange rate before ending your transaction.
 Moscow's ATMs have instructions available in several languages and operate using a 4-digit PIN. ATMs typically have the most competitive exchange rates, but you will almost certainly be charged a transaction fee and/or a foreign-exchange surcharge for each transaction. Also, as a security precaution you must notify your bank that you will be traveling in Russia prior to your departure.

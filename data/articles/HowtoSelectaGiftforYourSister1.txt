 Young girls are interested in things like My Little Pony, Barbie, Littlest Pet Shop, Bratz, Sesame Street, and so on. If you aren't sure what she likes, try asking some questions, such as:


"I'm taking pictures today. Could I take a picture of you with your favorite toys?"
"What TV show would you like to watch most?"
"Genies are so cool. If you met a genie, what would you wish for?";
, This will help in two ways: first, you'll avoid buying duplicates, and second, you can get some ideas. For instance, if she has lots of Littlest Pet Shop toys, you could buy some accessories or a new house for them, maybe. If she loves her American Girl doll, you could get some new clothes for it. Many toys work this way.
 Children's interests tend to change quite often. If she likes Frozen, buy her an Elsa doll for twenty dollars instead of an ice castle for a hundred dollars.
 While clothes are certainly a practical, simple gift, there are a lot of variables. You might get the wrong size or a color they hate. Not only that but kids are usually happiest when they unwrap a toy.


Clothes might be a very good idea for an infant sister, though. Just be sure you buy larger than you think you'll need; babies grow fast!

 If you get on stage and have NO idea what you are going to say, then chances are you'll hesitate and stutter. You don't HAVE to have a well written, spell-checked, award winning speech (Save those for times when you are in competitions and such.)! Just have a basic idea of what you are going to say. Example: If you are presenting a speech about cat behavior, think of three main points such as neutral behavior, good/happy behavior, and bad behavior. Then, find three main points about each of those topics.;
, If you are freaking out and are thinking about all of the negative things that could happen and you head is full of "what-ifs", then there is NO WAY you will be able to do it! Believe in yourself! If you just think something like, "It's all good. I know what I'm going to say and I can TOTALLY do this!", right before you present, then you'll be fine!

, If you think ,"I can't do this. I stink at speaking in front of people" or, "Everyone is going to hate my speech that I worked really hard on because it's so bad" you will not be able to do it! But if you believe in yourself, then everyone else will believe in you too.
 Practice in front of your mirror and before you go on stage. The more you practice, the more fluent and confident you will become!

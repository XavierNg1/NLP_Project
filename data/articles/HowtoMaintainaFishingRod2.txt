 Storing a rod improperly may result in damage or curvature. If you do not have a rack, store the rod on a hanger or nail in a closet.

Keep your rod and reel away from salt, dirt and other substances that may harm the rod, both while fishing and while storing the rod.






It is better not to store your rod in a rod tube, as tubes trap moisture, which can corrode the guide rings, the reel or the reel seat.

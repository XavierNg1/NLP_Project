 There are 10 millimeters for every 1 centimeter.


When you know the length of an object in centimeters but need to know the length in millimeters, multiply the number of centimeters by 10.

Example: 2.4 cm * 10 = 24 mm

, For each meter, there are 1000 millimeters.


If you need to know the length of something in millimeters but you are given the measurement in meters, multiply the number of meters by 1000 to find the equivalent number of millimeters.

Example: 5.13 m * 1000 = 5130 mm

, There are 1,000,000 millimeters in every 1 kilometer (0.62 mi).


To change a length measurement recorded in kilometers to one recorded in millimeters, you must multiply the kilometer value by 1,000,000.

Example: 1.4 kilometers (0.87 mi) * 1000000 = 1,400,000 mm

 Kids' bodies are still developing, so poses should not be held for too long, and the overall yoga session should match their age and ability.


Allow children 5 years old and younger to spend up to 1 minute or 60 seconds on each exercise or pose. The total yoga session for small children should not be more than 15 minutes.
Allow children who are 6 and older to hold poses and do exercises for up to 1-1/2 minutes, or 90 seconds. Older kids can often endure yoga sessions up to 25 minutes.;
, Teach kids to meditate or be still during these breaks.
 Showing kids how to do it rather than just telling them how to do it will help them move their bodies safely.
 Show kids how to stretch and loosen their bodies in preparation for yoga or any exercise.
 Yoga should never be practiced on a full stomach.
 This will keep them from trying poses that they are not yet ready for, or forcing their bodies into unnatural or harmful positions.
 A soft and supportive surface is important for safety and comfort.

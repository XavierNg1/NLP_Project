 If you plan on using the noodles in "pad Thai" or another stir-fry dish, use the lukewarm water method to partially cook the noodles so that they are somewhat soft but still hard on the inside.









This method also works well if you are adding the rice noodles to soup, but you can add rice noodles to soup without soaking or cooking them first.;
, Rice noodles are very brittle, so you need to be especially careful while handling them in their uncooked state. Otherwise, you will likely break more than a few.









Note that fresh rice noodles are soft, but most rice noodles are sold in their hard, brittle form. Fresh rice noodles do not need to be cooked or soaked in water. Instead, they are added directly to the dishes they are served in or steamed., Allow the noodles to soak for 7 to 10 minutes or until they just start separating.
 Since these noodles are only partially cooked, you will either need to transfer them to another dish immediately or store them in a way that prevents them from sticking together or drying out.









Drain the noodles. The easiest way to do so is to pass them through a colander.
Rinse the noodles under cold water to stop the cooking process. Drain once more.
Add the noodles into the stir-fry or soup if the dish is near the end of its cooking process.
If you are not ready to add the noodles to the dish yet, toss them with a small amount of sesame oil to prevent them from drying out or clumping together temporarily. Store in a sealed container at room temperature to further slow the drying process.

 Before attaching the flowers to the crown, you will need to cut small sprigs of baby’s breath. Try cutting the stems so that they are similar in length. You want to leave a few inches of stem. This will make it easier to attach the stems to the crown.If you want, you can tape together a few sprigs of baby’s breath to create a small bunch and then attach the bunch to the base of the crown. This will make a fuller looking crown.
 Take one sprig or bunch and tape it to the crown using floral tape. Lay the flowers horizontally along the crown base. Make sure to tape the entire stem so that you do not have any stems sticking out from the crown.Before attaching the flowers, attach the two ends of wire so that it is in the shape of a crown. Once the flowers are on, it is harder to bend the wire into a circular shape.
 Continue to tape sprigs or bunches of baby’s breath all the way around the crown until you reach the starting point. Make sure the flowers are all facing in the same direction and are placed horizontally along the crown.You can place them close together for a fuller look. Alternatively, you may want to space them farther apart for a more natural and bohemian look.

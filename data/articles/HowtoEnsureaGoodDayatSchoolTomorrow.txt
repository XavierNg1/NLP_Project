, You want to say "everything", but you have to think about reality. What changes are in your power? Create a list of specific things that are bothering you in school and you would like to change. Then think hard about a solution for the problem. Whether you need to speak to a teacher, social worker, or even the principle at your school in order to fix the issue, go ahead and do what needs to be done. This will be worth your time.
, Make sure you have a nice backpack with several pockets and places to put extra supplies. You should have one for your binder, folders and textbooks, one for your pencils, erasers, sharpeners, rulers, protractor, etc., and one in case of an emergency. In your emergency pocket, you should have a first aid kit, deodorant, sunscreen, sunglasses, gloves, extra cash, and whatever else you think you may need in an emergency situation.
, Greet people with a smile and compliment people on their clothes or accessories, even if it's not necessarily something you like. It will make them feel good about themselves, as well as you, when you see a smile on their face.
, Take a shower the night before the school day and make sure you look and feel squeaky clean for the day ahead of you.
, Before bed, make sure you have everything ready for tomorrow. Have your clothes laid out, have your homework done and most importantly, don't forget to brush your teeth! You'll regret it in the morning, stinker! When you're all set for tomorrow, get into your comfiest pajamas and crawl under your soft bed, preferably doing something relaxing such as reading a book or sipping a cup of hot tea. You'll fall asleep in no time.
, Yogurt with granola and berries with a glass of orange juice is a good choice. Cereal is a good choice too, just not Fruit Loops or Captain Crunch! Keep it healthy and natural.
, Don't let anyone get in your way today. No one can let you down if you are strong and don't let them. Stand up for yourself and have the day of your life!

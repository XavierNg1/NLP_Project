 If you work with someone you find attractive, you may not be able to simply avoid them. You can stay faithful to your partner by mentioning your partner around the person you are attracted to and saying positive things about them. Let everyone around you, including the person you find attractive, know how much your partner means to you and how well your relationship is going.This is especially important if you have to work closely with the person you find attractive. Letting the person know you are in a committed partnership may encourage them to keep their distance from you and maintain a strictly professional relationship with you.
 You can also stay faithful to your partner by dressing down so you do not appear as attractive to others around you. You may avoid wearing clothing that exposes too much of your body or that shows too much skin. You may also try not to look too enticing around the person you find attractive so they do not try to flirt with you.


Dressing down may not always be an option if you work in a professional setting with the person you are attracted to. You may be required to dress well for work and you do not want to jeopardize your job to avoid making yourself attractive to others.
 You should also try to maintain boundaries around individuals you find attractive and work on being friendly but not flirty with them. Though you want to have a healthy, platonic relationship with others, you should know when you have crossed the line from friend to flirty. Try to toe the line and stay in the friend zone so you do not put your relationships with your significant other in jeopardy.You can avoid being flirty by appearing engaged, but not too engaged, in what the person you find attractive has to say. Do not touch the person inappropriately or maintain eye contact with them for too long. Try to keep your conversations friendly but short and to the point so you do not come across as flirty.

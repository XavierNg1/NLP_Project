 The Pythagorean theorem is a formula for finding the third side of a right triangle if you know the value of two of the sides. You can use it to find the hypotenuse of a triangle, which is its longest side, or its length or width, which meet at a right angle.


Since a rectangle is comprised of four right angles, the diagonal that cuts through the shape will create a right triangle, so you can apply the Pythagorean theorem.
The theorem is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are sides of the triangle and c is the hypotenuse, or longest side.
 Let's say that you have a rectangle with a side of 6 cm and a diagonal of 10 cm. Use 6 cm for one side, use b for the other side, and take 10 cm as your hypotenuse. Now just substitute your known quantities into the Pythagorean theorem and solve. Here's how to do it:



Ex: 6^2 + b^2 = 10^2
36 + b^2 = 100
b^2 = 100 - 36
b^2 = 64
square root (b) = square root (64)
b = 8

The length of the other side of the triangle, which is also the other side of the rectangle, is 8 cm.
 Now that you've used the Pythagorean theorem to find the length and width of the rectangle, all you have to do is multiply them.



Ex: 6 cm * 8 cm = 48 cm^2

, Your final answer is 48 cm^2, or 48 cm. sq.

 Click anywhere in the paragraph you wish to double space, or select the entire document by holding down cmd+A on your keyboard.
 The toolbar is near the top of the document, but below the name of the document and the menu bars. It includes a long series of symbols on a grey background, from an icon of a printer on the far left to a double ^ symbol on the far right.
 The Line Spacing icon looks like a series of horizontal lines representing text, next to a vertical arrow pointing both up and down. If you do not see it, examine each icon starting from the right and moving left. It is located in the right half of the toolbar.
 Click this icon and select Double on the drop down menu. You may also select a spacing in between single and double, such as 1.15 or 1.5. You may enter a different spacing using the Custom spacing... option in this same drop down menu.

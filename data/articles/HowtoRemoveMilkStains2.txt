 If you spill milk on a couch cushion, it's important that you remove the cover as soon as possible so that you can clean it separately. Allowing the spill to seep into the cushion will make it harder to remove later.
 Before you apply any cleaners to the stain, see how much of the milk you can extract from the carpet or piece of furniture by blotting it.Use a cotton rag or sponge and run it under cold water before trying to blot it. Do not rub the stain or you may make it bigger.
 Use one tablespoon (14.78 mL) of liquid dishwashing detergent with two cups (480 mL) of warm water. Stir the solution until it's well mixed. This solution will help you extract any milk left over from blotting it with water.The solution should be sudsy when it's fully mixed.
 Dip your cloth into the solution and get the cloth saturated. Apply the wet cloth to the stain so that you transfer the solution onto your carpet. Continue to blot the stained area of your carpet until it's no longer visible.
 If you can't get the stain out using soap and water, you may have to use stronger chemicals. Mix two cups (480 mL) of warm water with one tablespoon (14.78 mL) of ammonia to create your solution. Get a new rag and dip it into the solution. Once the cloth is saturated, continue to dab the area that is stained.Use gloves when handling cleaning chemicals or supplies.
Never mix chlorine bleach with ammonia because it creates a dangerous chemical smoke that has harmful health effects., Use a fresh rag and dab the area with cold water. The goal is to remove any cleaners or ammonia that you used to lift the stain from the carpet. Once you've sufficiently blotted the area, no more suds or cleaner should remain on the carpet. Finish the area by using a dry rag to get any excess water that remains. Hanging your rug up will help it dry.

 Setting powder should be added after foundation and concealer but before lip and eye makeup. Setting powder is most important when using liquid or cream foundations, as it will reduce shine and help to keep your makeup from sliding off your face. It can also be used to extend the wear time of powder foundation., Pick a powder that is either translucent or close to your natural skin tone. Make sure the product is advertised as a finishing or setting powder and not powder foundation.


Powder that matches your skin tone will give extra coverage when concealing blemishes. However, it has the tendency to look thicker than translucent powders.
Translucent powder can match all skin tones and looks less caked on compared to tinted powder. Just be sure to blend translucent powder extra well, as flash photography can make it stand out.Like most types of powder makeup, setting powder can be either a loose or pressed powder.
 Take a large, fluffy makeup brush and dip it into the powder or brush it across the compact. Tap or flick the brush lightly over the container once or twice. This will remove any excess powder from the bristles.
 Apply with light movements, focusing on the center of your face. Take care to go over your T-zone, the outer corners of your nose, your chin, and your cheeks. Avoid the outer edges of your face., Use a kabuki brush or some other type of densely-bristled makeup brush. "Buff" the powder using small circular motions all across your face. This will keep your skin looking less pale and more natural.

 Consider the length of the fur. If the animal has relatively long fur then you will have to brush their fur more often. A pet owner should brush their pets regularly because it helps get rid of knots and dirt. It also helps spread natural oils through the fur that help the fur keep a healthy shine.;
, The sessions should be a positive interaction between owner and pet. You can give your pet treats before, during, or after to make brushing seem like a reward. If your pet has knots brush carefully so brushing is not associated with pain.

 If you want to know whether those spare, smooth threads sitting in your sewing box will tat well or not, there is nothing like trying them. Do the test of checking to see if the thread glides well in the shuttle first; if it does, then try a mini tatting project, or even just a few elements of a project and judge with your own eye whether or not the result is desirable.

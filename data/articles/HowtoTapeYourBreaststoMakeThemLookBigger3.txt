 Taking a warm bath or shower will help slacken the tape. If you don’t have a tub available or don’t wish to shower, you can use a wet towel. Simply use warm water to dampen it and lay it over the tape as you lay on your back. This will make is significantly easier to take the tape off., When it comes time to take the tape off, make sure you do so slowly and carefully. If you rip the tape off too quickly, you risk tearing your skin. Even if you used tape that is made for your skin (medical or sports tape), you still need to pull it off slowly. Pluck out the tape as you hold the nearby skin still. Be careful not to pull your skin.
 If you can’t seem to pull the tape off, apply baby oil to the skin. The baby oil will help remove the stickiness that is on your skin. Grab a cotton ball and dip it in baby oil. Follow the line of the tape as you slowly remove it.

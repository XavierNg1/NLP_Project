 This can be done by selecting the Forge from the main menu of the Halo: Complete Multiplayer Experience disc and selecting the Citadel map from the ones available. Gathering the Mythic skulls is infinitely easier when you are in a Forge session rather than Custom game.;
, Make sure that if you are not host, that the player who is has enabled all players to be able to enter editor mode.
 The skull is located past the overshield tunnel, in the bend before reaching the blue side. Make sure you are on the overshield side of the map, as Citadel is symmetrical; if you can't see the skull, move to the other side of the blue base.
 They are fairly large and "point" back towards the overshield. In addition, there is a small column to the left of these lights with arrow-lights running up it. If you reach the area of the blue base with the sniper rifle, then you have gone too far.
 You should see a gap in the ceiling with a beam running through it; the Citadel is sitting on a ledge in this gap. However, the area is far too small to enter and claim the skull, although you can fly up to it and view the skull.
 Grav lifts can be purchased for $5 from the Scenery category in the Forge items menu.
 Rotate it outwards - the idea is to launch the skull from its' ledge onto the floor below via the grav lift's pull. You'll need some skill with rotating objects, so try practicing first.
 If you have performed the extraction correctly, the skull should have been sucked from its' ledge and thrown on the floor below where you can claim it. Change from editor mode back into player form by pressing UP on the D-Pad again and pick it up by pressing the Right Bunker when prompted. Congratulations, you just found the Citadel Skull!

, It is represented by a skull with the Shield World symbol on its' forehead.

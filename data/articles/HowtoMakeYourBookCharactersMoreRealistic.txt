 This makes it easier.;
, Talk about his clothes, the way he walked towards someone, his facial expression, the way the other characters immediately acted around him, and anything that reflects the character's personality.
 Of course, this also means that his/her later actions need to connect with their personality or have some sort of consequence for the character, like emotional uncertainty or the sudden distrust of another character. If you use the "I don't know who I am any more" trick, don't overdo it, that can end up sounding clich√©d.
 A phrase or word that reflects how they feel about a situation. If a character says the word "Fantastic" when they're annoyed or aggravated, for example. Don't overuse it, but you should have it present if you do use it.
 If someone's eating an apple and the character is sitting by them, they could say, "I like pears better, apples are sour." Make sure this integrates smoothly into your text.
 Again, don't overdo it, or your character will lose his/her humanity. (Even if he/she isn't human.), Use it, it's so much easier to write about characters loosely based off yourself or your alter ego. Imagine that someone was saying every line to that character to you. Beware of Mary-Sues, though. Google this if you don't know what it means, as it's important.
 Maybe the character wants to go out to a Chinese restaurant, therefore, he/she likes Chinese., Do the same for good habits.
 If the character is angry, have him run his fingers through his hair. Or if the character is shy, have that character use one of it's arms to rub the other.
 Make sure you continue your characters' new traits as you're writing your book, if you're still writing.

 Make two walls using toothpicks or anything that will cut through the clay to create a big enough window for a marble to go through and one of the walls.
 Poke one small hole on each side of the window (with a toothpick this time) that is big enough for a rubber band to fit., On the other wall make two windows that are smaller than the last wall., Bend the walls so they connect at the top. Leave the bottom open., If you used clay to build your model's walls, let it dry (usually, a full day is best). If you used cardboard, skip this step., Make the wall with the one window look sharper, more pointed.

Use brown, gray, silver, gold, or yellow.
, Use the holes you poked earlier of the rubber band. Cut the rubber band in half. Put on the side on in one hole, and the other side of the rubber band in the other hole. Tie a knot in the outside of the clay, so you should have two knots. Make sure not to tighten the rubber band too much, so that it has enough room for the marble., Use a toothpick and red, yellow, and orange paper. Cut the paper in points. Tape or glue the paper to the toothpicks., Use a marble and the rubber band to throw a marble into another clay house. For the toothpicks, you can throw the sharp end at the clay house that is not dry, that way you can have the point of the toothpick stick in the clay.

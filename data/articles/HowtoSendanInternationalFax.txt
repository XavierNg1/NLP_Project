 Not all fax machines or public fax kiosks can send documents abroad. When you see a fax machine with international sending options, look at the prices to be sure that you're comfortable paying the international rate, which can be a lot more than a local rate for faxes.;
, Each country has its own code composed of several digits. You'll need this piece of information in order to dial the number that you use to send the fax.


Get access to a list of country codes through phone books, informational lists or other resources like phone cards. The web sites or promotional materials of phone card vendors usually have the relevant country code information. Having a list of country codes helps if you need to send international faxes on a frequent basis.
 Different fax machines and services are set up in different ways. Some require you to dial extra numbers to get an "outside line." Many machines may require an additional code with the country code in order to route the documents correctly. This code changes depending on from where you are sending the fax.
 Pay attention to what recipients abroad will be seeing. Your documents might go through, but the transaction may be delayed if the people who receive your fax can't understand what's in it. Take care to label your fax cover sheet with specific instructions for recipients, and consider adding foreign language descriptions if those in the destination country may not speak your language. Clearly identify yourself as the sender and include your phone number in case there are any issues with comprehension or receiving.
 Most fax machines take paper face down in order to correctly scan it.
, Most fax machines will generate a result for a fax when the machine has either sent it successfully, or encounters problems that eventually stops the transmission. Getting the paper document that shows successful transmission will help you out if there are problems later. You can also keep the receipt for tax records.

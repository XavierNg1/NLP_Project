 If you cannot consistently pay off your entire credit card balance each month and are accumulating debt, stop using the card. While rewards programs are great incentives to use a card, they can also be very costly if your use is irresponsible.If you carry a balance from one month to the next, you’re likely paying the card company more in interest than any perks you get from the reward program.
 A sign-up bonus is often the best way to accumulate points quickly. Know that there may be a purchase level you need to reach in order to receive the best bonus. Take advantage of your increased holiday spending to reach that level. For example, one major credit card offers a 100,000-point sign-up bonus if you spend $4,000 on the card within the first three months.
 One immediate factor to consider each year is the annual fee associated with your card. If you’re receiving and using your points, you’ve probably saved substantially more than the cost of the fee. However, if you only occasionally use your rewards points, a card with an annual fee may not be cost-effective. In short, you should choose credit cards that offer you the best advantages in light of your pattern of use. For many people airline miles offer the best advantages associated with rewards programs. Simple cash-back rewards may be best for others.
 The best way successfully to use credit card rewards to cover holiday expenses is to save them up throughout the year. Note that many rewards programs offer additional point bonuses for certain types of purchases throughout the year. For instance, you might receive extra points on hotel expenses during a particular fiscal quarter. Familiarize yourself with these incentives schedules, and consider making significant purchases during periods that will lead to the greatest rewards.

, Relax your hand and in a chopping motion pat the clients back. Keep in mind the motion should come from the arm and you should offer no resistance from the fingers or wrist.
 This must be used gently to avoid causing pain. Do not cross the client's spine when using this technique! This technique is especially effective for masseurs who have weak or fatigued hands.
, If the client has skin that is not hyper extended, it often feels very good. Pinch with both hands starting by placing your thumb and forefingers about four inches apart. Then "pinch" down to about half the distance. Then grab the next couple of inches a finger at a time allowing the previous grab to slide under your thumb. Your forefingers end up crawling and your thumb keeps the "roll" in check and sliding forward. The easiest area to do this is side by side the spine, but not on it. You end (or don't begin) when it is difficult to grab a roll.

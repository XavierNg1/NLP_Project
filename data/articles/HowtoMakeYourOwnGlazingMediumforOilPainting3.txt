 Because glaze is used in relatively small quantities (only an ounce or two at a time), you should pour out a small amount into the palette you're using to paint with.


Make sure to keep it separate from other paints and mixtures.
 Dip your brush in glaze, then add the paint you are using for the area. Combining glaze and paint on the brush will help ensure that the glaze matches the shape you want to have emphasized.


You should use a high-quality artist's brush in order to get the best effects from your glaze.
 Different combinations of oil will result in different transparencies and shine. Because of this, it may be worthwhile to experiment with a few different types of glaze in your work.


Using poppy seed oil, for instance, will result in a yellow tinge, which may be desired if you want your painting to look artificially aged.
 Using a glaze with stand oil means your painting will take significantly longer to dry. Because of this, you should allow a full week for an oil glazed painting to properly settle. If you don't want to wait as long, you can minimize your use of glaze, or even go without it entirely., Glaze should be used as a way to accent important aspects of the painting's foreground. The effect is lost if you glaze your painting excessively. Try to limit your glaze to the shapes you want to pop out at the viewer.You can also apply several light layers of glaze so you have more control. If you apply multiple layers, you may need to mix up more glaze.
 In order to keep the glaze fresh and useable, keep it sealed whenever you're not using it. It is good to keep the glaze sealed in the jar you made it in.When stored in an airtight jar, glazing medium will last several weeks up to a few months. If exposed to air, your glaze will dry out.

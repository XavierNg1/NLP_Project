If the lab results are positive for anemia, they will also tell the doctor which type of anemia you have.
Your doctor will work with you to prescribe treatment, which varies according to the type of anemia you have.Treatment for nutritional anemia is changes to diet, vitamin and iron and supplements or vitamin B-12 injections.

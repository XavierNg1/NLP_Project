 Go into very shallow water, and just get a feel for it. Splash a little, put your head under the water, blow bubbles, whatever. "Scull", or move your hands around in a way that they can feel resistance.;
, This can be tricky at first; it is very important to kick rather quickly (about 2 kicks/second) and your kicks don't need to be big. Point your toes, but don't lock your ankle joints. Concentrate on making your kicks as small and splashy as possible. This kick is only to get you comfortable in the water, although you may use if with the pull if it is more comfortable for you than the kick explained later.
 Lay on your back on the water, and kick. Now curl your arms up (monkey), straighten them out to either side (like airplane), and pull them down to your sides (soldier). The movement from airplane to soldier should propel you backward.
 Starting from the same back float position, drop your heels below you and flex your feet (monkey), keeping your knees in roughly the same position. Next, whip your feet around to either side and out straight, like a big V (airplane). Finish with your straight legs squeezing together, and pointed toes (soldier). You should feel the water pushing on the bottom of your foot as you kick.
 It is a lot easier to learn to swim if you get lessons too, so if possible learn to swim that way. Talk to a swim instructor (Water Safety Instructor) or swim coach at your local pool.

 You don’t have to do this first, but if you’re dealing with a significant amount of glitter, you probably should – otherwise you may find yourself going through a lot of tape or lint roller sheets. Run the glittery clothing through your typical washing and drying cycle. Make sure you wash these items by themselves. Adding other items into the same load with them will transfer the glitter to those garments, as well.;
, Lay the clothing out flat on a hard surface. Pull a large piece of tape off the tape roll. Place the tape strip, sticky side down, directly onto the fabric. Press down firmly. Then pull the tape up from the fabric. The glitter will stick to the tape. Repeat this as many times as necessary to remove all the glitter.After using a single piece of tape several times, the sticky side will start to lose its adhesive properties. Throw it away and start with a new piece.
Avoid using duct tape, which will not work as well as Scotch or masking tape and may damage some fabrics.
 Lint rollers are a little more user-friendly and work better than tape strips on large surface areas. Remove the outer wrapping from the roller to expose the sticky surface. Roll it up and down over the fabric. After you make several passes, the adhesive properties will lessen. Pull the sticky sheet from the roller along the perforated line, which will reveal a fresh sticky side. Make as many passes as it takes to remove the glitter from the clothing.


For stubborn glitter, use the roller vertically, then go across the same area with horizontal motions.
Lint rollers can be purchased at any grocery store. They are usually found on the same as aisle as laundry detergent and other related laundry items.

 Dry lips tend to flake and exfoliating is a great way to remove this dry flaky skin. This will ensure that your lips will be smooth when you apply a moisturizing balm. Your toothbrush is a great tool for exfoliating your lips. You can run it over your lips a few times after brushing your teeth or apply some lip exfoliator to it and use it to help slough off dead skin.Make sure that you use a soft toothbrush or the bristles may be too hard on your lips. Donâ€™t scrub too hard either. Just gently move the brush around your lips.
Rinse and pat dry your lips when you finish and then apply some of you favorite lip balm to moisturize them.
 Lip scrubs help to slough off dead skin, and they also contain moisturizing ingredients. You can purchase a lip scrub or make your own lip scrub using a couple of common kitchen items.








To make your own lip scrub, just mix together a teaspoon of brown sugar with a teaspoon of olive oil.
Apply your lip scrub to your lips using your fingertip or a soft bristle toothbrush. Then work the scrub around your lips. When you are finished, rinse away the scrub. Your lips should feel smooth and moisturized when you are finished.
 You can also exfoliate your lips with a wet washcloth or use the washcloth to wipe away any remaining exfoliating scrub.Make sure that you choose a soft cotton cloth to exfoliate your lips. Then, wet the cloth with warm water and use it to gently wipe your lips.








After you finish, pat your lips dry and apply a layer of your favorite lip balm to rehydrate them.
 Exfoliating your lips too often can irritate them and this could lead to dryness, so do not exfoliate your lips more than twice per week.If your lips seem irritated with this schedule, then only exfoliate them once per week or even every other week.

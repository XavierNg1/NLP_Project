 Buying your tickets before you arrive at the park allows you to gain instant access. Otherwise you will most likely have to wait in very long queues to buy the tickets, wasting valuable fun time.;
, The park opens at 9am, so aim to get there at around 8:30 AM to get a good parking space close to the entrance, and to make sure that you get in the park as soon as it opens.
 If your son wants to go on the Simpsons ride, and you want to see the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, then go there first. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is new, and will most likely be very busy, so head there first.
 Peak lunch time is usually around 12:30. Most people will go to a cafe or restaurant at lunch, so the queues will shorten at this time.
 This way, when people are watching the shows the queues will also be shorter.
 There is no way you will do everything in one day and still have to time to relax and have fun. Buying a multi day ticket gives you access to both of the parks, and gives you more time so you can chill out and enjoy your vacation.
 You are on vacation, so don't be afraid to let loose and just have a good time.

 Ice your bruise for about 15 minutes every few hours for the first few days after incurring a bruise. Icing reduces inflammation and swelling, helping the bruise heal quickly.;
, After reducing inflammation with ice, you can apply a warm compress (not hot) directly to the bruise. This will increase blood flow to the tissue and speed up the healing process.
 If your bruise is on an area that you can elevate such as one of your limbs, be sure to lift the bruise above your heart to reduce the blood flow to the bruise. Doing so will reduce swelling and discourage more blood from rushing to the bruise site and causing further discoloration. Elevation works best when performed immediately after incurring a bruise.
 For the first day or two after receiving a bad bruise, refrain from performing heavy exercise that causes blood to pump throughout your body. The more blood that flows to the bruise, the worse it will become.
 Use your thumb to gently massage around the outer edge of the bruise. Do not press hard or attempt to massage the center of the bruise, as doing so can be painful. Be sure to massage in a small circular motion. Doing so activates the lymphatic process so that your body naturally starts to get rid of the bruise on its own.
 If you can get 10 to 15 minutes of direct sunlight on your bruise per day, the UV radiation will begin to break down bilirubin, which is what causes a bruise to yellow. Getting sunlight will help speed up this process and make your bruise disappear quicker.

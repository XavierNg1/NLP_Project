 Although Adblock Plus is installed, it comes with a feature enabled by default that allows some non-intrusive advertising to appear. This means that most advertisements will still show up, although Adblock Plus is installed. This feature might help websites because they usually earn revenue from views on their ads, but disabling it makes sure that no advertisements will appear at all. To disable these exclusions, click the Menu button, click Add-ons, click Options next to Adblock Plus, click Filter preferences..., then uncheck Allow some non-intrusive advertising on the Filter Preferences window and click Close.
 Although Adblock Plus is installed, you might come across some advertisements which it does not suspect and it allows to appear. To block a missed ad, hover over it until a tab that says Block appears, then click it. A more advanced method is available for ads that do not have the Block tab, but this step will work for blocking most ads.

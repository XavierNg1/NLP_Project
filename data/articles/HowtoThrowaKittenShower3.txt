 Contact all of your volunteers to make sure everyone understands their assignments. If possible, schedule a meeting within a week of the event to sort out last minute details.


Make sure set up and clean up crews know how early to arrive and have an idea of how late they’ll be staying.
Contact any restaurants donating food to confirm your arrangements. Confirm any other gift or prize donations with other businesses.
If any volunteers are preparing food, gently remind them and confirm what they’re bringing.
 On the day of the event, have one volunteer in charge of each game. Fun fundraising games and raffles include:A raffle drawing where the winners get to name kittens
Raffle drawings for donated gift certificates and gift baskets
Pin the tail on the kitten (or pin the kitten on the cat lady)
Word scrambles, crosswords, and guessing games

, In addition to entertainment, you should set up an informational table to educate guests about fostering and adopting kittens. Have members of the shelter staff volunteer to coordinate this station.If you elect to offer adoptions the day of the shower, have around ten kittens on hand in a play corral or pen at the shower. Remember that you’ll need extra volunteers to keep the kittens.
Have the shelter ask current pet foster parents to help at the foster table and provide information about the fostering process.
 You’ll need to designate a spot for people to place donated kitten supplies. A playpen is a cute option and, like the kitten shower itself, it’s a fun reference to a baby shower.See if a volunteer has a playpen they can lend for the day. You can also look for one at a local thrift shop.
 After throwing your successful kitten shower, rally your clean up crew and break down the event. Be sure to be as delicate as possible when breaking down decorations and packing up party supplies. Reuse as much as possible to cut the costs of next year’s shower.

 If your teacher’s behavior frightens you or makes it hard for you to learn, consider getting a parent involved. Examples of behavior that might warrant parental intervention:


Yelling frequently, belittling students, or deliberately humiliating students.
Being very disorganized. This might include losing assignments or failing to enter grades.
If the teacher can’t teach in a way that allows you to learn.
Handing out work without teaching material.
 Come prepared with specific examples. Rather than saying, “My teacher is scary,” for example, say: “Last Thursday, my teacher got so mad he hit all of our desks with a ruler and shouted at us for ten minutes. I was really scared.”

, It might be a good idea for your parent to e-mail or write to your teacher. That way, she has documentation of their interactions in case she needs to go to the principal or other authority later on. The e-mail can include a request for an in-person or telephone conversation, and it should include a telephone number.


Read the e-mail over before your parent sends it, if possible, to make sure that your parent has understood the issues.
 Your parent should note when he made the call.
 If the teacher doesn’t respond, the issues are not resolved, or the situation worsens, it’s time to talk to someone above the teacher.

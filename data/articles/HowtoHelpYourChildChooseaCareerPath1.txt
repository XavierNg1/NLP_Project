 Ask your child what their favorite subject is in school. Discuss your child’s hobbies and extracurricular activities. Make note of what they are good at as well as what they enjoy. Listen and be supportive of things that your child shows interest in during this discussion.


You might start the discussion by saying something like “So what is your favorite class this year?”
For example, they might enjoy math and basketball, but only be good at math.;
, Your child is still growing and developing into an adult and may be surprised to find out that they have specific strengths that could be beneficial in a profession. Tools such as personality assessments and standardized tests such as the SAT or ASVAB are designed to pinpoint a child’s strengths. Understanding their strengths will allow them to start looking at professions that will allow them to use their unique talents.For example, some children really have a knack for technology. If this is the case, a career in an IT field might be a great fit.
 They often have career assessment tools that can help to narrow down career fields. They will also have record of your child’s grades and school achievements which might aid your discussion with your child.


You can ask your child's guidance counselor: "Do you know of any particular tools that we could use to explore career opportunities for Mike?"

, Everyone has a task or set of tasks that they want to avoid at all costs. You should be upfront with your child to recognize what these things are for them. Knowing what they do not like doing will help them steer clear of professions that heavily expect them to do things they don’t like. Bring up tasks that you know your child struggles with and discuss how they might apply in a career.


For example, you might say something like “I know you complain about your math homework every night. Are you sure you want to be an accountant?”

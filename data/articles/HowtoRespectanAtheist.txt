, Just . . . don't. Trying to convert somebody to your religion is like waving a big red flag that reads "HEY! I DON'T APPROVE OF YOUR WAY OF THINKING AND I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY MINE INSTEAD." This is almost the complete opposite of respect. It's actually quite disrespectful.
 If you had to ask a question to find out if somebody's an atheist, like "Where do you go to church" or you outright ask "Do you believe in *insert religious deity here*" then chances are they didn't want to talk about it anyway. If you know, great. But they're still the same exact person you knew them as before.
 This stands for anybody, really. If something makes you uncomfortable, don't do it. If what you're asking somebody to do makes them uncomfortable, you shouldn't be asking.
 Atheists are saying "I do not believe in the existence of a supreme being or beings." Anti-theists are saying "The very idea of religion is revolting, wrong, immoral." If someone is an anti-theist and they are targeting your religion while around you, you are under no obligations to deal with their views. Get away from them - that kind of social interaction isn't good for you anyway.
 Let's use metaphorical cake to understand this. If you are religious, you're saying "I like cake." and the atheist is saying "I do not." Do not say "But you haven't tried it yet!" or "No, you're wrong and you like cake - you should try it." just say "Okay." and offer them doughnuts. Or ham. Or whatever metaphorical food atheists would eat.
 To them, you're wrong. To you, they're wrong. No one knows exactly what's going to happen until all is said and done and they're six feet under. And that's okay.

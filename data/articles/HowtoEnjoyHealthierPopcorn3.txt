 If you want to give your plain popcorn a spicy kick, dust it with a little cayenne pepper or chili powder. You can add as much or as little as you like, depending on how much heat you want your popcorn to have. Toss the popcorn well to ensure that the seasoning is evenly distributed.You can also season your popcorn with taco seasoning, but choose a salt-free or low-salt option to keep your popcorn on the healthy side.
Tossing your popcorn with some hot sauce can also give it some tasty heat. Just be careful not to add too much or the popcorn may get soggy.
 If you want your plain popcorn to have more distinct spicy flavor, sprinkle some Old Bay or jerk seasoning over it. Look for a salt-free option, though, to make sure that the popcorn doesn’t have too much sodium.Make sure to toss the popcorn well after you add the Old Bay or jerk seasoning to make sure that the seasoning doesn’t clump together.
 Garlic and parmesan cheese make an ideal topping for plain popcorn. Sprinkle a little of each over your popcorn, and toss well to coat. Be careful not to use too much cheese, though -- it can be high in sodium.If you’re having trouble getting the garlic powder and cheese to stick to all of the popcorn, mist it lightly with olive oil first to give it something to stick to.

 Place the colander in a bowl that is large enough to hold it.
 Pour the plain yogurt into to the lined colander. Gather the corners of the muslin cloth and tie with a rubber band to form a bag.
 Leave the yogurt to drain for about 5 hours in the refrigerator. If you want a thicker consistency, leave it for longer.
 Better yet, use an old packaged cream cheese container to do the job!

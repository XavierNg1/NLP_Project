 Many dogs have an upset stomach but are not sick in any other way. This means that while they have diarrhea, they are otherwise healthy. Diarrhea that occurs suddenly and stops after your dog fasts or has a bland food diet is acute.


For these dogs treatments like withholding food and then re-introducing a bland diet may be all that is needed., Diarrhea is a symptom of gastrointestinal (GI) distress. For a dog experiencing acute diarrhea, their stomach and GI tract need time to recover after they have had diarrhea. Do not feed your dog for 24 hours after they have experienced diarrhea.This 24 hour period gives your dog’s GI tract a chance to recover and heal.
Continue to give your dog small amounts of water so they do not become dehydrated.
 After your dog has completed the 24 hour period without diarrhea, you can reintroduce food. Healthy dogs that are suffering from diarrhea may only need a few days of bland food to reduce their discomfort. Rather than feeding them their regular dog food, try feeding them a bland food diet for 24 hours.


Offer your pet a small meal of boiled chicken and white rice. Do not use any seasonings when you cook the food as they may upset your dog’s stomach.You can continue feeding your dog this bland food diet until their stool becomes normal again., Diarrhea physically expels the bacteria in the bowel that help your dog digest food. To speed up recovery, it helps to give your dog a dietary supplement that contains helpful bacteria to help get your dog’s digestive system back on track.There are many canine probiotics available without prescription from your veterinary clinic, such as Promax (an oral paste) or Fortiflora (granules which are added to food). Typically these are given once a day for three days.
Dogs use different digestive bacteria than people do, so there is no point feeding your dog a human probiotic product.

 This all depends on the size of your quilt. A good starting point is around 2.5" (6.25 cm) wide. These will form a smooth border around the edges of your quilt.


Cut enough strips to surround your quilt. The end product needs to be a bit longer than your quilt to overlap on both sides.
If you don't have four long strips, sew the strips together to cover the length of the quilt.
 With right-sides-together (this means face-to-face), align the binding strip with the top edge of the quilt and then pin along the long edge of the quilt.
 Sew from one end of the quilt to the other. When you reach the end, carefully cut the excess binding off, so that the bottom of the binding aligns perfectly with the bottom of the quilt.


Repeat for the opposing side and then again for the other two.

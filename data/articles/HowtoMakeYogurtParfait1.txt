 You'll find the ingredients in a list above. The great thing about parfait ingredients is that it is completely customizable. Keep them in a place near each other on your work station.;
, You'll be putting the ingredients in this container, so try to keep it near the food items. Chill this glass beforehand in the freezer or fridge. This makes the food cool and keeps it fresh.
 Don't add all of the yogurt yet; you still need room in the glass for the other ingredients. At this point you may add any other ingredients to the parfait. It is your choice; this is what makes a parfait so unique. You can add strawberry jam for some sweetness, cereal, oatmeal, granola, fruit, or whatever else you like. Be sure to leave some room in the cup for the final step.
 You want to have more yogurt on the top then on the bottom. If you have too much on the bottom all of your cereal and fruit will sink and get soggy in the yogurt. I recommend using plain yogurt so the real flavor of the ingredients come out but if you want to intensify the taste of the fruit then add a flavored yogurt. You can substitute a flavored yogurt for a fruit. Serve the dish fresh, preferably right after you have prepared it. If you don't like I said the granola or cereal will get soggy.

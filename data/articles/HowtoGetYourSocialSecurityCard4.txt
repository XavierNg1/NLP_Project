 You should apply for a child's Social Security card while giving information for a child's birth certificate. When you apply, you will need to provide a birth record for the child. The only exception to this requirement is if the Social Security application is completed at the hospital immediately after the baby has been born., In addition to verifying your own identity, you will need to provide documents to prove your child's identity and date of birth. A birth certificate, while required, is not enough to confirm the identity of the child, and additional documentation is necessary to verify that the child has continued to exist beyond the date of birth.Acceptable documents to identify your child include:


a state-issued non-driver's ID card for the childan official adoption decreea record from the child's doctor, or from a clinic or hospital, verifying that the child has been given medical attention after birtha religious record (like a baptismal certificate, for example)a record of the child from a school daycare centera school ID card, If you are seeking a Social Security card for a child you have adopted or are in the process of adopting, it is best to wait until the adoption is complete. The SSA may make exceptions in some cases, but generally the SSA recommends waiting and applying for a Social Security card with the child's new legal name.If you are seeking a Social Security card for your child to claim him or her for tax credits, and the adoption has not yet been finalized, you can contact the IRS directly to fill out Form W-7A (Application for Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending U.S. Adoptions - available at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw7a.pdf). The IRS can also help provide you with additional information on how to proceed.

 Open the song you want to edit in Audacity.


Make sure you have a copy of the original file saved somewhere else, in case you accidentally over-edit.
 Split the stereo tracks, to separate the right and left channels.You should see a program with a pretty standard layout, with tools and menus at the top and a grey window with your file below. Within the window for your file, you'll see that it's further broken down, with a few buttons to the left of the visualization of your audio.
In the top left corner is an X. Next to it you'll see the words "Audio Track" with an arrow next to it. Click this to open a drop-down menu.
Click "Split Stereo Track".
 Select the part of the track you want to remove vocals from on the lower of the two channels, using the cursor.


You will want to double check that the cursor tool is selected. It looks like an "I" and is located to the right of the record button (red circle).
 Open the "Effect" menu on the top bar and then select "Invert".
 Open the same "Audio Track" menu that you opened before and set the track back to "Mono". Do this for both of the two audio channels.


Notice that you lose certain instruments with this method, along with the vocals. Drums are one instrument that suffers.
 Save the file as normal.

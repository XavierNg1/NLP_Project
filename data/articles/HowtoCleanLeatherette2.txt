 If you spill on a leatherette surface, the best thing to do is wipe up the spill immediately using a damp cotton or wool cloth. This will help to prevent the development of stains.For example, if your child spills juice on your leatherette car interior, you can dip a cotton cloth in water, wring out the water so the cloth is damp, and then wipe down the surface with the cloth.
Once the spill has been wiped up, dry the leatherette using a clean dry cloth.
 In some cases you may not be able to remove a stain by simply wiping the leatherette with warm water. In these cases you will need to use a soap and water mixture. In a small bowl, combine warm water with a tablespoon of mild dish soap or hand soap., Then, dip a soft cloth into the water and soap mixture and wring it out so that the cloth is damp, but not dripping wet. Using the damp cloth, wipe the entire leatherette surface with soapy water., After you have wiped the entire surface with soapy water, take a new cloth and dip it in a bowl of plain water. Wring out the towel so that it is damp, but not dripping wet. Once the cloth is wet, wipe the entire leatherette surface. This will help to rinse away any soap that remains on the leatherette., Once the leatherette has been rinsed, use a clean dry cloth to dry the surface. Rub the cloth over the entire surface until it is completely dry.

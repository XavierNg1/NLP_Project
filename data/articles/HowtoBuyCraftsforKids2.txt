Making art should not be a chore for the child. Children should enjoy completing the project.






Girls may find making bracelets and designing bags fun while boys may enjoy building cars and wood crafts.


A child will take more pride in the craft if he or she has a choice in the type of work that is purchased.






Some children love to paint. Others like clay or bead work. Buy crafts that match the child's art creation interests.

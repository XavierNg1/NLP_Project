 The holidays are busy so don’t beat yourself up if you don’t have time (or energy) to make homemade cupcakes. Store bought cupcakes will be just as fun and your guests will still appreciate the treat.


If you purchase pre-frosted cupcakes, make sure they have white frosting, which will become the snow underneath the tree.;
, You’ll need two colors--white and green. The white frosting will be slathered on top of the cupcake, whereas the green frosting will be piped over the sugar cone.


Spoon green frosting into the piping bag and add a small tip. If you don’t have a piping bag at home, no worries--use a large, re-sealable plastic bag instead. Spoon frosting into the bag and then smooth out air pockets before sealing. Snip a small hole on one corner and twist bag until you’ve created a piping bag.






Frost the top of each cupcake with the white frosting (if you don’t purchase pre-frosted cupcakes).
 Position the cone upside down with the wide-mouthed area secured into the frosting. Be sure you center the cone in the middle of the cupcake.
 Begin at the base of the cone and work you way upward with the frosting. Add small peaks throughout the frosted cone to resemble tree limbs. Make sure you don’t see any evidence of the sugar cone.
 When you decorate these cupcakes, think about how you approach decorating a Christmas tree and place decorations/sprinkles in strategic areas.

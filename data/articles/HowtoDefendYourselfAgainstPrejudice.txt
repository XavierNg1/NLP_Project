 Prejudice occurs when the person you're dealing with has previously developed notions about some aspect of your identity without ever having met you.;
, Some people with prejudices have had them for a long time, so it's unlikely that you will be able to change them in a course of a day. Sometimes the best thing, if it's possible, is not to engage at all.
 There are two ways of looking at prejudice. One is that it's a highly personal affront, targeting something that makes you you. Another is that since prejudice is all about preconceived notions. A person's prejudice has nothing to do with you; it's outdated material having to do with some generalized "other".
 Is the person who is prejudiced against you in your circle of friends, and able to listen, reason, and discuss rationally, without getting too emotional? If so, ask them what they think they know about you, and find evidence to refute their claims.


If the prejudiced person has authority over you, tread carefully in case you disrespect them.
 Petty anger in any conversation ultimately gives your counterpart the higher hand by discrediting your validity. Remember, you're a member of the group that's being prejudiced against, so you want to impress. This could vary by situation, but usually the best way to impress in this context is by mature, evidence-based reasoning, with compassionate listening to better understand the viewpoint of your counterpart.
 Avoid engaging in their anger, as that may only escalate it.

 You will need the best rod in the game in order to catch Dratini. You can get the Super Rod on Route 12 in the house with a Fisherman inside. Talk to him and you will receive the Super Rod.;
, Dratini can only be caught in the Safari Zone. You don't need to worry about which Pokémon you will use to fight, as there are no battles in the Safari Zone. You can get to the Safari Zone from Fuchsia City., Dratini can be caught in any of the four areas of the Safari Zone. Throw your line out into any body of water you see to start fishing. There is a 15% chance that the Pokémon you catch will be a Dratini.


When you hook a Pokémon, you will need to press the A button to set the hook, otherwise the Pokémon will get away.
There is a 1% chance that you will catch a Dragonair, Dratini's evolution.
 You have four options when you start a Safari Zone battle: you can throw Bait, a Rock, or a Safari Ball, or you can Run. Throwing Bait will make it less likely to run away but decreases the catch chance. Throwing a Rock will make it easier to capture, but increases the chance it will run away.


Throwing Bait followed by a Rock will cancel the effects of each. If you want to improve the catch chance, either throw one Rock, or a Bait followed by two rocks.
 If the ball doesn't capture the Dratini, it will have a chance to run away. If it runs, you will need to fish again to catch another one. If it stays, you can try another Safari Ball on your next turn.
 Once you've caught your Dratini, you can start training it to eventually evolve it into a Dragonite. Dratini can be used in a variety of party builds, thanks to its speed and Dragon-type attacks. To get the most out of your training, make sure to check out this guide on managing EVs, which can greatly affect the way your Dratini plays.

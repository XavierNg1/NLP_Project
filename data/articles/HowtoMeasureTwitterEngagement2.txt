 Open any web browser on your computer and go to the Twitalyzer website. Press Enter and you will be directed to the official website of Twitalyzer.
 Click the “Sign In” option on the top right corner of the page. This will take you to a new page; here you can find the message “Authorize Twitalyzer 4.0 to use your account?” with two options “Authorize app” and “Cancel.” Click the blue “Authorize app” button.


This will take you to a new page asking for your Twitter account details (email and password). Enter the details and sign into Twitalyzer.
 On the homepage of Twitalyzer, type your Twitter handle, and click “Go.” Your Twitter handle is the one that starts with @.
 You will then be shown your Influence, or engagement, score. This is the number of followers you have in your Twitter account, the number of times the tweets of someone are re-tweeted, the number of re-tweets that were done by you, and the number of tweets made by you in a week.

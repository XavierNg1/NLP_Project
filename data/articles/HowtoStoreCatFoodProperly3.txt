 When you are purchasing food for your cat, always choose a bag or can that does not have any visible damage. For example, avoided bags that have rips, tears or discoloration, and cans that have been dented. Damage to the bag could indicate that the food has been exposed and contaminated., Both dry and wet cat food will have an expiration date stamped on the original container. When purchasing cat food, you should always read the label to make sure that the food is not expired or soon to be expired. Make sure you refer back to this date before you feed your cat and discard any food that is past the expiry date.The expiration date is usually stamped on the bottom of canned foods and can be found on the bottom or side of bagged cat food.
 Once you open dry cat food, it should be consumed within four to six weeks. As a result, it is a good idea to buy your cat food in small bags. This will help to ensure that your cat is receiving fresh food.If you have multiple cats, you may want to consider a larger bag of cat food.

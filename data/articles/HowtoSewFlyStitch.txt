 This is for practice, so make it easy on yourself an use a colorful thread. Even embroidery thread is good for practicing with, as it's easy to see. Knot one end of the thread to prevent it from coming right through the fabric when pulled up.
 Bring up from the back of the fabric to the front of it., This should be opposite the first stitch a little way. Do not pull the thread tight. This should form a "loop"., This should be about midway between the loop made by the previous two stitches but lower down, so as to form a V shape. As you bring up the needle, catch the loop with the needle. Now you can pull tight and a basic V shape will be formed, with the loop stretched down on each side from points A and B by the stitch created by C., This time, you have a choice to decide to keep the V shape, in which case, keep the end stitch close to the base of the V, or you can make a Y shape by taking the reinsertion point a little further down and pulling tight.

The choice of either the V or the Y formation will be determined by the final look you're seeking. For example, the Y shape is very useful for forming flower stems if embroidering ribbon flowers or buds.
Do a row of these stitches horizontally or randomly to create a field or flower bed of flowers. Alternatively, keep working downward in a neat line from the first fly stitch to make a vine or joined pattern. If making a row straight down, always come up where you left the last V or Y shape.

 The staff has been around the cats, and they know what each one's strengths are. Discuss what you're wanting with a staff member, and they may be able to point you towards a cat who will be perfect for your family.For instance, you could say, "I'm looking for a very friendly, laid-back cat. I have small kids, and the cat would need to be pretty tolerant. Which cats fit that description?"
Alternatively, you could narrow your choices down, and then say, "Can you tell me some about this cat's personality?";
, Knowing a cat's background can tell you how they'll do in your family. Of course, the background of every cat at a shelter isn't known, but many come from families who couldn't keep them. Certain cats may be used to being around kids already.For instance, a cat that lived with a family before is more likely to be okay in your home. However, you can ask, "Can you tell me what you know about this cat's background? I'm looking for a family cat. Do you know why the family gave this cat up?" Sometimes, the family may have had no choice but to give up the cat, as it is often due to unforeseen circumstances, such as having to move overseas.
However, if a cat lived in a single-pet household with an older person, they may not adjust well to living with a family with kids.
 A home with kids tends to be loud and busy. Often, shelters are the same way with so many pets and people coming through. Therefore, a cat that seems happy and engaged in the shelter may fit in well in a loud home environment., While kittens are adorable, you don't really know what you're getting with a kitten, though you do have more of a chance to mold their personality. However, kittens are not a good option with small children, as they are delicate, and kids may not be as gentle as they need to be with them.

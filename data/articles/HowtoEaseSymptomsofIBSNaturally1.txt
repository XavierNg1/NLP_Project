 Some individuals who suffer from IBS are sensitive to foods that are high in insoluble fiber, such as wheat, cereals, bran and pasta. Other foods like nuts, seeds, popcorn, crackers contain moderate amounts of insoluble fiber.


Like fat, the insoluble fiber is a gastrointestinal stimulant. Insoluble fiber in fruits, veggies and grains can’t be easily broken down during digestion.
When this happens, gas is produced along with other IBS symptoms like bloating and cramping.;
, Foods rich in lecithin are egg yolks, soybeans, cow milk butter and animal brains. You can also buy soy lecithin granules in most supermarkets or health food stores. The recommended dosage of lecithin granules is 10 gm., twice a day for a year. Lecithin helps restore the endothelium which is often damaged in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)., Fructose is a type of sugar that isn’t easily metabolized. It also ferments rapidly, causing gastrointestinal discomfort and, in some cases, intolerance.


Natural sweeteners like honey, fruit juice from apples, peaches, prunes, cherries and corn syrup all contain fructose.
Malabsorption of fructose is a complex condition. It has recently been associated with depression and bacterial overgrowth, in addition to aggravating IBS., The carbon content of sodas and soft drinks can easily soak the gastrointestinal tract. This causes gas accumulation from carbon discharge, triggering inflammation.


Meanwhile, caffeinated beverages increase the intensity of the acid production that causes IBS, while alcohol contains toxic substances that can be irritating on the bowel.
 While it is important to note which kinds of foods should be avoided, the frequency and amount of food eaten are equally important. Gastroenterologists recommend small, frequent meals for IBS patients, rather than fewer large meals.


Eating large meals may cause symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, abdominal spasm and bloating in IBS patients.

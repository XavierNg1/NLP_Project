 Stores that specialize in health food and exercise-centric products often carry these ingredients. Dextrose is favored as a post-exercise protein shake additive, because it can be used to easily manipulate insulin levels in the blood. Maltodextrin is favored for the opposite effect - it is very high on the glycemic index, and is metabolized very slowly.;
, Many grocery stores will carry these products as well. Look for them either in the baking aisle near the other sugars, or in the vitamins and supplements section. They can often be found near the protein powders and shakes.
 Specialty stores stocking beer brewing or wine making supplies nearly always stock these 2 compounds. If you do not see them on the shelves, ask an employee, as they may be kept in bulk containers in a back room.
 Another option for finding these 2 products is through a pharmacy. You will have better luck searching at large chains rather than smaller, locally owned pharmacies. Ask an employee to help you, as they may keep these products behind the counter.
 The guaranteed way to find these 2 products in the quantities you want is by shopping online. Health food stores, winemaking supply stores, and many general retailers will stock these products. Online shopping is ideal if you need very large quantities of dextrose or maltodextrin, or if you live in a remote area and do not have access to the more specialized options presented above.

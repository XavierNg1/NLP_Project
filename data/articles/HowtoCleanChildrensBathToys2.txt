 The dishwasher runs at high temperatures in order to destroy any bacteria, so always check the label on the toy(s) to make sure it is dishwasher safe before using this method.
 Itâ€™s important to dry the toys as much as possible before you put them in the dishwasher to help reduce the moisture on and in the toys., Put them in a lingerie bag or in a plastic basket if they are smaller, on the top shelf of the machine., You can use regular detergent, a natural solution, or dishwasher capsules.


For a natural cleaning agent, use a solution of one part white vinegar and three parts warm water., Use the warming cycle setting to ensure the toys come out dry.Some machines have an extra cycle with a higher temperature for sterilization. Be careful with this option as bath toys made of plastic or rubber can melt or be damaged by high temperatures.
 Put the toys on a dry towel to air dry completely before putting them back in the tub or allowing your child to use them.

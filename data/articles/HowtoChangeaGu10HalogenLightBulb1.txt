 You really don’t want to get electrocuted, right? This is the first step and probably the most important in terms of safety. Make sure that you do this before going any further. Wait for the light to cool if it only just burned out. If you don't feel any heat, it is probably safe to proceed.;
, You will want to be able to comfortable move your elbows around too, it’s going to be much harder to change the bulb if you are standing up on your tiptoes trying to change it using only your finger tips. Find something that will put you at a comfortable height and allows you to use both hands easily.
 If your bulb doesn't have a protector on it, the oil from your hands can cause some serious damage to the bulb. Try to only grip it from the sides if it doesn’t have a protector. If it turns out the bulb is only loose rather than burned out you don't want to risk it exploding due to the oil on your hands once you screw it back in.
 Keep your grip and pressure constant on the bulb with the thumbs as you turn the bulb slowly counter-clockwise. Once it feels like it won’t turn any further, you can stop pushing it inward. You should rotate it about 90 degrees. , Wiggle it gently as it comes out to make sure it comes out cleanly. Be careful not to drop it, especially if you are on a ladder.
 Remember to keep your gloves on as you do this so as not to get any oil from your hands on the new bulb, which would be even more dangerous and could cause it to explode in the socket if it heats improperly.
 Once you’re back up on your ladder, you’ll press the bulb inward into the same position that you took the old bulb out from. Twist it clockwise as far as it will go, and you can turn the lights back on!

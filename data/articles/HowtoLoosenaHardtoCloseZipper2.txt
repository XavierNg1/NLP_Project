 Sometimes, rust can form on the inside of a zipper or on a zipper's teeth. This problem can happen more often with cold-weather outdoor garments. If rust is present, use a household anti-rust lubricant like WD-40. Just be careful not to get it on the fabric of the garment.
 The issue could be caused by tiny pieces of debris getting in the zipper. That debris can cause the zipper to not zip as easily. Applying vinegar can help take care of the problem by cleaning it out, allowing it to zip more readily.


Soak a cotton ball with vinegar. With the garment flat, run the cotton ball up and down the zipper. Make sure not to get it on the fabric if you think it may bleed.
Apply it to both sides of the zipper, as well as the inside of the teeth.
 Dish detergent can be used to clean out your zippers. However, be sure to test the detergent on an inconspicuous place first. If it doesn't affect the color of the garment, scrub the detergent into the zipper, using a brush. Wash it out, and see if it helps your zipper be less sluggish.

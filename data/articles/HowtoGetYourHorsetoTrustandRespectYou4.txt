 Use driving aids, such as a lead rope, and your own energy to indicate what you want the horse to do., The lead rope will be your driving aid.
 Make sure that the lead rope is not taut., This will signal to the horse that you are giving him a command.
 The wiggling motion is meant to indicate the horse that it should walk backwards.The horse may either not respond or walk in a direction other than backwards. If this happens, wiggle the rope with more force until the horse at least begins to walks backwards.
 Eventually, your horse should learn to walk backwards with only a slight wiggle of the rope or pointing of your index finger.

 Set your apple wedge on its flat end between two knives. The knives should be at the top and bottom of your apple wedge.
 Make another vertical cut a quarter of an inch (0.635 cm) from the flat side of the wedge of apple. Continue to cut until the butter knives stop you., Instead of making a horizontal cut and risk cutting yourself, flip your apple on its other flat side and create another vertical cut. This should cut out another, smaller wedge of apple from the larger wedge that you cut.
 Set the smaller piece of apple between the butter knives and create another wedge out of it. Out of your smaller wedge, repeat the process until you have three or more different sized wedges. These will act as the different layers of your swan's wings.
 Push out the wedges of apple so that they are staggered and appear like wings. Each wedge should show a little bit of the wedge under it to create a wing-like effect., Repeat the steps using the other large apple wedge that you had cut out of the other side of the apple. Continue repeating the steps until you have two staggered wings.

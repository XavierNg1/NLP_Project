 You should only treat the exteriors with products designed for leather shoes. This includes non-enzyme liquid soaps designed for leather products.You can use the same leather shoe cleaner you would use on other leather shoes to remove dirt and scuffs.If the insides of the slippers are leather, use the same process to clean the interior.
 After cleaning them with a leather cleaner, let them sit for approximately five minutes. Then shine the slippers with a clean, soft, cotton cloth., To keep leather slippers soft and moisturized, apply a leather shoe conditioner after cleaning.The leather will absorb a natural conditioner easier than synthetic ones. Apply the conditioner as directed to help them age better., For fleece-lined slippers, use the same process as with fleece-lined suede slippers. Namely, baby wipes, which are low in moisture and contain a mild detergent.Use a couple of baby wipes to scrub out the inside of each slipper until the wipe is no longer discoloring from the grime.


You can alternatively use a mildly damp washcloth with just one or two drops of wool detergent or baby shampoo to scrub out the insides of the slippers. This method requires using a second damp washcloth to remove any excess soap afterward.
 You donâ€™t want to apply heat to leather slippers. You will need to give them time to air dry. As with the suede slippers, you can use a wad of newspaper inside the slipper to help draw the excess moisture out of the lining, which will hasten the drying process a bit.

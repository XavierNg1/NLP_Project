 Add 6 ounces (170 g) of melted white chocolate and an 8-ounce (225 g) package of cream cheese to the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat the mixture on medium speed until it is smooth.If you prefer, you can use a handheld electric mixer to make the truffles.
 Once the chocolate and cream cheese are combined, add ¾ cup (80 g) of crushed coconut cookies, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of coconut rum, and ⅛ teaspoon (1 g) of kosher salt. Beat the mixture until it is just blended.Any type of plain coconut cookies will work for the recipe.
You can substitute water for the rum if you prefer.
 After the cookie mixture is blended, line a 9-inch (23-cm) pie plate with parchment paper. Use an offset spatula to spread the mixture over the plate, and cover with plastic wrap. Chill the mixture in the refrigerator for 2 hours., When the mixture has chilled for a couple of hours, remove it from the fridge. Use clean hands to roll the cookie mixture into 1-inch (2.5-cm) balls, and place them in a parchment-lined pan. Return them to the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours.Make sure to cover the pan with the truffles with a piece of plastic wrap before you chill them.
 An hour before you plan to serve the truffles, add 1 ½ cups (112 g) of shredded coconut to a shallow dish. Roll the balls through the coconut to coat them and chill them for another hour. To serve, remove them from the refrigerator and place on a platter.Refrigerate any leftover truffles in a single layer in an airtight container. They should last for up to a week.

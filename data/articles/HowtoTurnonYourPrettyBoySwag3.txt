 If you can't dance, you can't attract the ladies, and if you can't attract the ladies, you have no "pretty boy swag". Try watching videos online of hip-hop or rap dances and imitate them. Alternatively, you could take dance classes at your local dance studio, or have a fellow dancer teach you. This might sound intimidating but you’ve got to be able to dance and you could meet a lot of girls in the process of learning. Just remember to keep that confidence high at all times.
 Prettiness defines the "pretty boy swag". You can raise your prettiness by pumping the iron and getting in great shape. Try working out 3-4 times a week. Be sure not to tire your muscles or lose focus on your goal. You’re going to have to work out a lot. You also don’t want to be so overly muscular that you look intimidating. Part of being a pretty boy is that you have a good body but you also look refined and ‘pretty’. Don’t take this too far, just stay in good shape.
 Playing a sport is super hot, but some sports are better than others. This is definitely a part of being a pretty boy, because you have to show some talent in order to back up your swag. Basketball, baseball, football, and hockey are all sports that will get you the attention that you want so, so, so badly. Don’t run cross-country or play ultimate Frisbee if you want to have pretty boy swag. You never hear about the cross-country runner getting the homecoming queen.

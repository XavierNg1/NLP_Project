 Using a sponge, your hand (in a glove, if you want to avoid a mess), or simply a bowl full of ketchup, apply ketchup to the entire surface of your bronze. Let it stay covered in ketchup for about 15 minutes. Rinse it with warm water, and then dry it with a soft cloth.
 You can squirt lemon juice onto it, or soak the item in lemon juice for 15-20 minutes. Remove the item, rinse it with warm water, and then dry it thoroughly with a soft cloth.
 Pour equal portions of white vinegar and water into a large bowl, and soak your item in the solution overnight. The next morning, rinse your item off in warm water and dry it with a soft cloth.









If your item is large, such as a statue, this method will be more difficult. If you do not have a bowl large enough to fit the statue inside of, consider trying a different method for cleaning.

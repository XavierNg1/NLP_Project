 Let yourself get accustomed to the nap time. Read a book if you wish, and get very comfortable.


A nap is a very good thing to follow up homemade/store made spa treatment and/or bubble bath.



If you can't sleep, stretch a bit in bed and imagine what will happen in the event.
This is one time when you can let yourself think of the event, maybe even dream about it.

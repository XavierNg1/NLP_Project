 First, arrange the apple upright on a cutting board. Then, use a sharp knife to cut the fruit in half directly through the core. Finally, slice each of these halves in half along the stem axis. You should have four roughly-equal quarters.
 Use your knife to scoop out the seeded portion of each apple slice. To preserve as much as the apple as possible, carve out only the small crescent that encases the seeds. Compost the core, or dispose of it the garbage.For a slightly quicker method, simply slice off the edge of the apple quarter that includes the core. You might lose some edible apple this way, but you won't need to be so precise., Place the apple quarter skin-up on the cutting board. Then, slice or dice each apple quarter into pieces of your desired size and shape. For a snack-ready portion, try slicing each quarter into three wedges.Feel free to eat the apple quarters as they are. You have removed the core and the seeds, so the apple is perfectly edible in this form.

 MERS is transmitted via respiratory secretions, so being in close contact with someone puts you at high risk for contracting the virus.


Refraining from close personal contact until your loved one recovers is your best bet, if you want to avoid becoming infected yourself.
The person who is sick should avoid contact with others as much as possible. Staying in a separate room and using a separate bathroom is ideal if the house is big enough.People other than the caregiver should stay out of the room in which the sick person is staying.
 Be sure to clean surfaces such as doorknobs, countertops, dishes and cooking items, towels and other bathroom surfaces. Minimize shared items if possible until the infected person recovers.
 This will certainly help you (and anyone else in the house) to avoid catching MERS.


The sick person should wear a facemask to prevent transmitting the virus through respiratory secretions. If the sick person cannot wear a facemask, then caregivers should wear them when in the same room.

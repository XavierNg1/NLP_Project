 If you use a colored piece of paper, the white crayon writing will be visible instantly. If you use regular white paper, you can write your message and it will be invisible against the white background. You can vary this method by using any color crayon with the same color paper, e.g. black crayon and black paper.If you use other colors, make sure the crayon color and the paper color match exactly. For example, a dark orange crayon will not be completely invisible against a light orange paper.
This method is just for fun and is most suitable for young children. Most adults could find this message simply by holding the paper at a different angle.;
, It might take a couple of tries to get your message right. You will not be able to see as you are writing, so the first few tries might be a little messy. If you need to get it right the first time, you could use a stencil to guide you as you write in your message., Instruct the person receiving your message to color the paper with water soluble paint. As they apply the paint, the waxy layer of crayon will protect only the paper directly underneath it. This will result in your message standing out in white against the color of the paint around it.You can also color lightly over the message with another colored crayon, but you have to be gentle not to displace the white crayon.

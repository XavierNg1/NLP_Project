 The doctor should take no more than five minutes to get the eyelash out. Specifying beforehand what you need increases your chances of seeing a doctor that day.
 You can visit either an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. Optometrists primarily treat vision problems, but are equipped to handle some eye diseases and concerns as well., Ophthalmologists are medical doctors who treat a wide range of eye problems. The doctor will remove the eyelash quickly and safely, ensuring the eye doesn't get infected.

 While you may be tempted to “tempt” fate getting sick or, worse heading to the ER on Thanksgiving (or any holiday) may not be the way your friends and family hoped to spend the occasion.


Scrutinize every recipe. Especially if you are cooking, segment which parts of each recipe could cause you harm and consider how you can substitute.
Ask the chef about particular foods. For example, if you have a peanut allergy give the cook a heads up about your concern so he/she can address your allergy and ensure that nothing you consume includes a damaging ingredient.
Offer to bring your own food. Why compromise everyone else’s taste buds if you can just cook at home and bring your own? You can devise recipes that are so delicious, some of the guests who don’t have a food allergy may opt for trying your fare instead.;
, While some people go into full blown anaphylactic shock others may only experience a mild irritation that could be treated with medication.


Avoid any foods that could cause you to make a trip to the ER. Anything more severe than mild skin irritation is never worth it. Avoid at all cost any food that will cause serious danger or harm.
Carry allergy medication with you to combat possible food allergies. If you experience mild skin or gastrointestinal issues and you can combat these problems with medicine, consider taking your medication beforehand and indulging.
Have an EpiPen or emergency plan on hand at all times. This includes off-holiday events as well.
 If you have a dairy allergy, for example, what other foods can be just as delicious but do not include dairy. Long before the holidays experiment in your own kitchen with different recipes and foods to uncover what may be a tasty substitute.

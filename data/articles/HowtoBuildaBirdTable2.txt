 You'll need:


1 piece of marine plywood measuring 300mm x 300mm x 12mm (11.8 inches x 11.8 inches x 0.472 inches) thickness for the tabletop
Four strips of wood measuring 50mm x 275mm x 12mm (1.9 inches x 10.8 inches x 0.472 inches) thickness for the tabletop edge pieces
1 post or pole approximately 1.5m (4.92 feet) long
See the "Things You'll Need" list for the remaining items.
 Sand the tabletop and edge pieces to ensure that there are no crevices in the wood that might harbor uneaten food that can encourage bacteria.
 Leave small gaps at each end to make it easy to sweep out uneaten birdseed and to allow for water run-off.
 Use the angle brackets to screw the post and tabletop together, following the guidance of the angle bracket holes. As you add the brackets, keep checking that the tabletop is level and that the brackets are sitting properly.
 Be sure to place them for even hanging.
 Push the post in firmly. The bird table is now ready for use.
 Watch the birds as they come to eat.

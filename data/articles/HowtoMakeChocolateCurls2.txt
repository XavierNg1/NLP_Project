 Wrap a sheet of waxed paper around your rolling pin. Attach the paper to the rolling pin with scotch tape, or place rubber bands on both ends of the rolling pin to keep the paper down. Prepare a surface underneath with a large sheet of waxed paper to catch any dripping chocolate.
 Scoop up some melted chocolate using a ladle, a large spoon, or a cup. Or pour into a pastry bag for greater precision. Pour a small amount of the chocolate slowly onto the rolling pin. Continue to drip the chocolate along the rolling pin in a zig-zag motion.
, Carefully remove the chocolate from the rolling pin. Place onto a dish covered in waxed paper and place the dish in the fridge or freezer until set. Use immediately, or store in a ziploc bag in the freezer until needed.

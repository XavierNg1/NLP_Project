 This test will only give a very rough estimate of water hardness, but it only takes a few minutes. Start with a bottle that can hold at least 12 ounce (360 mL), and preferably more. If you can't find a bottle with a cap, use any clear container., Measure 12 ounces (360 mL) of your tap water and pour it into the container.
 Some soaps react to hard water more than others, which is one reason this test isn't always accurate. Many dishwashing detergents do not react much to hard water, so it may be best to use liquid hand soap for this test.Castile soap is a common choice, since its simple ingredient list ensures that other chemicals are not interfering with the results., Cap the bottle and shake it for a few seconds. If your container doesn't have a cap, stir vigorously until the soap is thoroughly mixed into the water.
 Open the bottle and look for suds at the top of the water. If there are plenty of suds, your water is probably quite soft.If there are only a few bubbles, move on to the next step.
 Add more soap five or ten drops at a time, shaking the bottle after each batch. The number of drops it takes to make suds will give you a rough estimate of your water hardness:20 drops: slightly hard
30 drops: moderately hard
40 drops: hard
50+ drops: very hard

, Completely soft water creates foam at the surface, but leaves the water itself clear. The minerals in hard water react with soap to create "soap scum." Besides reducing foam, this scum makes the water look cloudy. If you water is thick with soap scum, your water is almost certainly hard.
 A result of "moderately hard" or below typically won't cause major problems in your household.If your water doesn't seem too hard but you are noticing problems, read below for DIY solutions or more accurate tests.

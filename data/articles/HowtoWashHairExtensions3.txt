 Because you want to avoid damaging the keratin bonds, shampoo selection is very important for this type of hair extension. Do your best to find one made specifically for use with hair extensions. If this isn't possible, pick a mild moisturizing shampoo instead.Be sure to avoid shampoos containing sulfates and silicone. Sulfates will dry out your extensions, while silicone may cause them to slip off., Use warm (but not hot) water. You can do this in the shower or at the bathroom sink. Run your fingers through your hair to make sure it is soaked-through and tangle-free.
 Shampoo your hair, including the extensions, as you normally would. Take a dollop of shampoo and lather it into your hair. Massage it in beginning at the scalp and work your way down to the bottom hair tips. Rinse the shampoo out with warm water.
 Keep in mind that extensions will not be reached by your scalp's natural oils. Even if you don't normally need to condition your hair, use one when wearing extensions., Hot water may damage your extensions, while cold water will not properly remove residue. Wrap your hair with a towel to remove excess water when you're finished. Leave your hair to air dry.
 Remember that more frequent washings will shorten the lifespan of your extensions. If you normally go longer without washing your hair, add a leave-in conditioner to your extensions to keep them moisturized.


If your natural hair is oily, try using dry shampoo to reduce the washing frequency necessary to keep your hair looking clean.

 If you have multiple areas of text in a single document that you want to change to the same color, you can make it happen with the Selection tool ., A bounding box will appear around the selected text area.


You can also select text by selecting it in the Layers panel. Find the layer that contains the text you want to change, then click the circle to select it.
If the Layers panel is not already open, hit F7 to open it.
 Keep the ⇧ Shift key held down as you click each area. Each selected area will now also be surrounded by a bounding box.


If you are using the Layers panel, you can select multiple layers by holding down ⇧ Shift as you click additional circles.
Once you have selected all of the areas (using the Selection tool or in the Layers panel), let go of the ⇧ Shift key.
 The palette is represented by a box that’s the same color as the currently-selected text. A larger palette will appear, containing a variety of colors from which to choose.


To change the Stroke (the outline surrounding the text rather than the text itself), double-click the bottom of the two boxes. It will either have a red line over it (if there is not currently a Stroke color) or will be displayed as a box with a thick outline around it.



If you’re dissatisfied with the color, press ⌘ Cmd+Z (Mac) or Ctrl+Z (Windows) to undo the changes.
You can also change other text attributes this way, such as font face and size.

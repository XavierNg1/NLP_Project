 Make sure you have a good layer of butter on each slice of bread - chip butties are well known for being sopping with butter! Only real butter will do, no cheating with margarine.;
, Place a heaping layer of hot chips on your bread. Chips (called french fries in the USA) are what give the chip butty its name. The chips should make up the main portion of the sandwich.
 A chip butty should be enjoyed with a few dollops of ketchup or HP sauce; however, you can add an extra surge of flavour by adding cheese, sliced meats, tomato, or your favourite sauces. Salt & pepper would not be out of place on a chip butty, either.

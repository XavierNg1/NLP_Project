 These will give you an opportunity to listen to native speakers have realistic conversation. You'll likely find these videos online, or you might be able to order recordings. Experiment until you find one that you can understand but still challenges you. Consider looking for children's movies if you need to practice more basic French. Don't turn on the subtitles unless they're in French, too.;
, If you have any friends who are learning French, practice speaking with them! Of course, if you know anyone whose native language is French, even better!

, Practice reading comprehension by reading whatever French publications you can find. Again, search online for these. Keep a French-English or French-French dictionary close at hand, but try not to use it!

, Local universities or French immigrant associations might offer low-cost French lessons. Nothing can beat a good teacher.
 As you practice, try to remember what words tripped you up. Try making lists of new vocabulary words, or practice writing out tricky conjugations.

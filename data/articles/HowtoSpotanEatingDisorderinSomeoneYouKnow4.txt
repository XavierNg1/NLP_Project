 If you have identified that your friend might have an eating disorder, you may want to consider talking to him about it. Be there for your friend and listen to his struggle. Although your support can be helpful, chances are one person alone will not get your friend to realize something is wrong.


You can begin by saying something like, "I care about you very much and I'm concerned about your eating habits and that they might be hurting you. Have you every thought about getting help?"
Be careful not to diagnose your friend by saying, "I think you are Bulimic."

, This may be too big a problem for anyone to handle on their own. Direct your friend to a therapist or psychologist.


Offer your assistance by saying something like, "I can help you find someone to talk to if you'd like me to."
You can search the American Psychological Association (APA) database for therapists in your area.Tell your friend to contact his insurance company to find out more information about services and possible therapists.
 Positive reinforcement can be a very helpful way to increase good behaviors such as eating healthy.


When you notice your friend eating in a healthy way, tell him, "I noticed you are eating a normal amount lately. Good job!"

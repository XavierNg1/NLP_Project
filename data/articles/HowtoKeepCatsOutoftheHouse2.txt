 While smells will keep cats away, most of them need to be reapplied frequently. You may need to renew them as often as every day or once a week.
 Most cats do not like the smell of citrus. You can either spray lemon juice around your door or try scattering citrus peels near the doorway. Another option is using a few drops of a citrus essential oil dissolved in water.You can also try other essential oils dissolved in water, such as lavender, citronella, or eucalyptus. Citronella may also cut down on bugs in the area., You can use the urine of animals like mountain lions, coyotes, or foxes from online retailers.Basically, you spray the urine, creating a border around your property.It's better to use these sprays to create a border around your yard rather than your entryway.

You shouldn't spray these urine right by your door, as it will be unpleasant when you're going in and out. Even when you spray them in the yard, you're going to be able to smell them., Cats don't like the smell of certain plants. Therefore, if you keep those plants near your door, the cats will likely stay away. For instance, you can plant lavender, rue, or penny royal. Lemon thyme is also an option., Hot peppers such as cayenne and crushed red pepper irritate most cats. Therefore, you can try sprinkling them around your door to deter cats. You can also try mixing some hot sauce with water and spraying it in the area., Two other smells that cats don't like are coffee and pipe tobacco. You can use old coffee grounds or what's leftover in a pipe after smoking (or fresh tobacco). Just drop some of the leftovers on the ground near your entrance to keep cats away., These repellents contain smells cats don't like, and you use them the same as homemade sprays. Spray them near your entrances and around the yard to keep cats away. You can find these sprays at pet stores.

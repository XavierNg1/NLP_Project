 Be careful not to get water inside their bodies or to the top of their tails, because the washer securing their tail will rust.;
, DO NOT use a brush used on humans, because the oils in our hair can damage their hair. A new flea comb from the vet's office will work great.
 Most shampoos work just fine, but you should get one that's clear. Suave will work great and isn't pricey.
 Now rinse out the shampoo and brush it once more.
 Again, it doesn't need to be expensive, but clear is best. Brush and rinse.
 If you want curls, skip this step. Now, for straight hair, gently wrap the mane around your pony's front leg and secure with a hair tie. Do the same with the tail and one of the back legs. Let dry, take off hair ties, and gently brush.
 Wrap your pony's hair around a straw or straws, depending on how many curls you want. Secure with hair ties at both top and bottom of straws. If your curls aren't staying in very well, spray their hair with body spray. Different sizes of straws will give you different size curls. When dry, unwrap and remove straw.

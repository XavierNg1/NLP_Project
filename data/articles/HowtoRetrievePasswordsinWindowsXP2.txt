 This method will only work if you have a bootable Windows XP CD. If it’s an original Windows XP CD then it will be bootable. If it’s a burned CD, it may not be, but there’s no way to know unless you try.
 When the computer restarts, you’ll see a message that says “press any key to boot from disk.” Press a key on the keyboard.If the computer boots up without asking you to press a key, then the Windows XP CD you’re using isn’t bootable.

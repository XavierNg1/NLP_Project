 Now's a good time to dice the onions, while you wait.;
, Use â…” of the Fritos, or enough to cover the whole pan. Save the rest for the topping.
 You can use any kind of canned chili, or make your own using the recipe below.


Optionally, add diced tomatoes, canned or fresh.
 Once your oven is preheated, put the casserole dish in the oven. Leave it for about fifteen minutes, until the chili is hot.


For an even easier recipe, add all the ingredients on top of the chili and bake in one sitting.
 Spread a layer of sour cream over the chili with a spoon. Top with the diced onion, the rest of the Fritos, and the grated cheese. The Fritos on top will stay much crunchier than the Fritos at the bottom of the pan.


Optionally, sprinkle the sour cream layer with shredded lettuce for a fresher taste.
 Return to the oven and bake a few minutes longer, until the cheese is melted. Serve hot.

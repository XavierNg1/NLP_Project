 An IF receiver (RX) is an optical sensor that detects infrared light signal from the IR transmitter (TX) on your remote controller.

Look for the receiver on the front face of the TV or device. Most often, the IR receiver is discretely placed along the top or bottom edge of the screen and covered by a red or gray film or plastic lens.
Use a flashlight to better locate the receiver lenses. Sometimes they are so small and placed within the protective edge of LCD screens or the covers color match and are flushed in with the surface.;
, A damaged or scratched transmitter diode may not effectively send out signals to your device.

Remove any buildup grime or dirt from old remote controls.
, A dirty IR can diminish effective controller distance by several feet., Having the unit too far back from the edge may obstruct the line of sight between the remote controller and the receiver., Remove it or sometimes it has a thin film of color that can be peeled off the back.,,, Alkaline batteries may be too strong for a remote control even though they are rated with same voltage.,,

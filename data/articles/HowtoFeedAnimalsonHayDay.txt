, Before you can feed your animals, you must create feed for them. This is where the feed mills come in. Feed mills manufacture feeds that you can use to feed the animals. They look like big wooden cans with a mill on top.


If you don’t have a feed mill yet, you should purchase one. Tap the cash register button on the lower left corner to bring out the shop. Tap and hold the feed mill and drag it to the location where you want to put it up. You can only have one feed mill until Level 12.
 The feed mill is used to produce more feeds for your animals. Tap on it, and select the bag of feeds you want it to manufacture. Feeds can be for cows, pigs, and chickens, and the respective pictures of the animals will be marked on the bags of feeds. Drag the bag to the feed mill. It will start running.


Note that each type of feed requires certain crops for you to harvest. Make sure you have the crops needed to make the feed.
 The feed mill can produce three bags of feeds at a time, which you can use to feed three animals. The bags will be placed in front of the feed mill when it stops running. Tap on them to collect them.
 Animal enclosures contain your animals, such as cows, pigs, and chickens. They are grouped together and enclosed by fences.
 Tap the animal enclosure that contains the animals you want to feed. The appropriate feed will appear above the animal enclosure, with the number of feed available indicated on the bag. Tap and hold on the bag of feeds.
 Drag the bag of feeds across the animals inside the enclosure. The number of bags will be reduced as you feed each animal. The fed animals will begin producing.


You need one bag of feed per animal.
You can only feed the animals when they’re hungry, which you will know when they remain idle.

 You've learned your numbers and you're almost ready to count your way around the Emerald Isle. However, there's just one more important thing. When you specify what you're counting, the noun will take one of two mutations (a séimhiú or an úrú as they are best known), depending the specified number and whether the noun begins with a vowel or a consonant.



Example: Counting words that begin with a consonant, e.g. boats (bád )

Bád amháin
Dhá bhád
Trí bhád
Ceathair bhád
Cúig bhád
Sé bhád


Here we change:

Seacht mbád
Ocht mbád
Naoi mbád
Deich mbád


The mutation used from 7-10 is known as an úrú. The following letters take an úrú (the úrú is specified in the preceding brackets: (m)b, (g)c, (n)d, (bh)f, (n)g, (b)p, (d)t, (n-) a/e/i/o/u

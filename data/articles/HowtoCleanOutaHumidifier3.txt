 Leaving water to sit in the water tank for long periods of time causes mineral deposits to collect on the bottom and sides. The longer you leave the water sitting there, the more deposits will collect and the harder they'll be to remove.
 Do a deep clean every two weeks or so.
 Old humidifiers that have gotten a lot of use may start to break down over time. The worn-out parts will be more prone to hosting bacterial growth.


If you've had your humidifier for more than a five years or so, you might want to consider replacing it.
If you aren't ready to replace your older humidifier, make sure to clean it with bleach or peroxide every few weeks.
 If the humidifier is causing the area around it to become damp, turn it down. Surrounding the humidifier with dampness can lead to the growth of bacteria and mold.
 When it's time to put the machine away after the winter, clean it thoroughly and make sure it is completely dry before putting it away. When you take it out again next year, clean it again before using.

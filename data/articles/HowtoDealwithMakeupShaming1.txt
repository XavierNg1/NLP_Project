 Sometimes, the best way to deal with negative comments is to ignore them. If you get comments on your makeup, simply do not respond. If someone makes a disparaging comment on your appearance, pretend you did not hear it and walk away.Sometimes, people may think they're being helpful with their comments. Someone may say something like, "You would look so much prettier without makeup," thinking of this as a compliment. Simply smile and offer little response. The person may take the hint.;
, If someone is mocking you about your makeup, even after you ignore them, think of a comeback. You could sarcastically say something like, "Thanks for sharing. I really value your input," and then roll your eyes. Oftentimes, people tease those who they think won't fight back. If you're able to make a witty comeback, people may realize they can't make fun of you as easily., People who shame others often thrive on a response. Avoid showing that someone upset you. If someone comments about your makeup, try not to react with anger or sadness. Remain neutral instead.It's important to let your emotions out, so remember to deal with them later. You can rant to a friend or write a journal entry, for example.

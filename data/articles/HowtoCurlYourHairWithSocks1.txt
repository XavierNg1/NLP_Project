, Be sure to condition your hair and brush out any tangles prior to styling. Hair should be damp, but not dripping.
 Grab a section with your non-dominant hand and hold it at the end. Place a tube sock across your hair so that it is perpendicular. The sock should be placed halfway between the roots and ends of your hair.
 You should leave about one or two inches at the end loose.
 Once you reach the roots of your hair, tie the ends of the sock securely together.
 It's easier to start at the bottom of your hair and work your way up. Don't style bangs, if you have them.
 You can sleep with the socks in overnight, or if it is daytime, sit out in the sun and allow hair to dry.
 Do this one-by-one using each section, and gently tousle your hair to release the curls. Be sure your hair is fully dry before removing the socks.

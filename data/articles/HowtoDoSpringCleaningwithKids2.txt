 Begin each task with your child. Show them what you want done and demonstrate cleaning techniques. Keep an upbeat attitude and emphasize the importance of teamwork.Use this time to model behavior about teamwork and about the importance of cleaning.
Divide tasks in each room. For example, you can clean the tops of mirrors and windows while your young child cleans the lower half with you.
You and your older child can work together to determine the tasks needed to clean each room and each choose the jobs you can do best.
Give a tween or teen the more exciting jobs, like using a power washer to clean your patio.
 Break tasks down into smaller chunks that can be accomplished quickly. For example, when cleaning bedrooms, start by making beds. Assign your child one short task at a time, then set a timer. Tell them that if they complete the task before the timer goes off, they can have a reward like extra play time or an extra sticker on their chore chart.


Find age appropriate rewards. For example, let a tween spend time on their phone or the computer if they finish before the timer goes off.
 Find upbeat music to play while you clean. Let your child help you choose the songs. Ask your tween or teen to create a playlist. Sing along and take dance breaks to motivate yourselves.Time them with music. Tell your child that if they finish a task before the song ends, they can take a dance break.
 Taking responsibility for a major cleaning job will motivate an older child. Assign your tween or teenager an important chore, like vacuuming all of the furniture, shampooing the carpets, or polishing the floors. Give them a few tips and the tools for the job, then tell them that you trust them to get the job done. Set a deadline and let them work at their own pace.


Praise them as they are working and when theyâ€™ve completed the job.
Reward them with a slightly later curfew, extra driving privileges, a book, or a trip to Starbucks.

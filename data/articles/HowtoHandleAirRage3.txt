 Sitting close to strangers, fighting for room, and feeling claustrophobic are all reasons why people in airplanes become on edge. Additionally, dealing with inconsiderate passengers, like those who kick the seat in front of them, talk too loudly, or have no regard for those around them, can increase a person’s stress level.


The combination of all of these factors is enough to cause someone to become so irritated they react differently to being agitated than they would otherwise., Research has shown that some air rage occurs because passengers feel they are the subject of inequality. People who aren’t sitting in the first class section are often upset because of the amenities provided in that section aren’t offered to them. As a result, they may lash out on other passengers or the crew because they feel like injustices are occurring.


You can avoid this cause of resentment by booking a flight on a plane that doesn’t have a first-class section. Select the right company to fly with and you may avoid feeling this rage., Some people turn to drinking or pills before they get on the plane to help combat anxiety about flying. Although it is a good idea in theory, doing so may actually backfire. People tend to become more impulsive and let go of their inhibitions when they are under the influence of alcohol or sedatives. This means you may experience rage you wouldn’t normally, and lash out on someone who is irritating you.

 A healthy diet promotes strong bones and can help speed the recovery of fractures resulting from osteoporosis. Consume adequate amounts of calcium with vitamin D since your body can not make calcium, and vitamin D is needed to aid in the absorption of calcium.


Look for no fat or low fat dairy items which can include soy or cow's milk, cheese and yogurt. Include vegetables that are dark green and leafy such as spinach, broccoli or bok choy in your daily diet. Munch on some almonds as a snack. Integrate fortified foods like cereal, bread and orange juice into your breakfast to start the day.;
, Regular resistance or weight training can help build and maintain bone density. It can also help improve balance and coordination, decreasing the risk of fractures from osteoporosis.


Run or jog to naturally rebuild strong bones from osteoporosis. Play tennis, do aerobics, use resistance bands or lift weights to help slow the progression of osteoporosis. Try yoga or tai chi, which uses your own body weight to hold multiple poses. Walk, hike, climb stairs, dance or jump rope to use your body against gravity, which is considered resistance training.
Exercise for 1 hour 3 times per week to gain the benefits of improving bone density. If 1 hour is too much, participate in physical activity for a half hour 5 times per week.
 Aging decreases the body's ability to properly absorb calcium from the food you eat, so supplements help balance your nutritional needs. Calcium and vitamin D supplements are often prescribed as part of osteoporosis treatment.


Read the label on the supplement bottle carefully and follow the directions given. You can find calcium or vitamin D sold separately or together in one pill.
Factor your daily requirements of each nutrient to know how much to take. The daily requirement for calcium in the average adult is between 1,000 and 1,300 mg per day and for vitamin D is 600 IU (15 mcg) per day.

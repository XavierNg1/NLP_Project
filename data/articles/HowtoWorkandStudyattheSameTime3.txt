 Get in the habit of keeping a weekly plan for yourself and ensure that you set aside time for your studies every day. This can be written in a tangible calendar, or electronically with one of various electronic scheduling programs. Vary the study times to fit in with other commitments, including your job as well as exercise and social engagements., As soon as you receive assignments or are made aware of an upcoming test date, schedule specific blocks of time to prepare. You may also need to adjust your work schedule to ensure you don’t work the evening before a big project is due or an exam is scheduled.At the start of the term, transfer everything from each class’s syllabus into your calendar, so you know exactly when important dates are coming up.
One good practice to try out is studying for an hour or two either right before or after each shift you work.
Once you’ve got a good week plan in place, try to stick to it. For example, don’t pick up a shift if it will cut into time you intended to study, unless you know you can make up that study time the next day.
 The proliferation of easy-to-use communication and information sharing technologies has made collaborative learning not only more feasible, but more beneficial. That said, it’s even better to sit down with other students and work through challenging material together.Include cooperative studying sessions in your weekly schedule – perhaps at the campus café every Thursday evening?
Make use of group message boards, which are often even facilitated by the class itself. If one does not already exist, make one and invite your classmates using their school email addresses.

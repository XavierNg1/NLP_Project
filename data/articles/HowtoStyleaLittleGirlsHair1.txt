 Before you style your little girl's hair, it's a good idea to have the necessary equipment and accessories ready and easily at hand.


This might include things like a hairbrush, a comb, some leave-in conditioner, hairspray, barrettes, elastics, hair ties, hair bands, bows, ribbons and any other accessories.
You may also need things like a flat iron, curling tongs or hair dryer.;
, Little girls don't always enjoy having their hair done and their impatient wiggling can make it difficult to do their hair right.


Therefore, it is a good idea to have her sit in front of you -- on either a high stool or a cushion on the floor (if you're also sitting) -- and give her something to look at while you're working, such as a cartoon, a book or a Nintendo.
Hopefully she'll be so engrossed in whatever she's doing that she'll sit still and forget to complain when you pull her hair!

, Before you attempt to do anything with her hair, you will need to thoroughly brush it out to remove any knots and tangles and make the hair look as smooth as possible.


This will make her hair much easier to style and will prevent any lumps or bumps from forming.
The best way to detangle hair is to spritz it with some leave-in conditioner and work from the bottom up, i.e. from the tips towards the roots. This causes the least pain and minimizes the damage to hair.

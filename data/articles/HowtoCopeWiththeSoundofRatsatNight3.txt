 Simply reducing the access that rats have to food supplies and shelter is an excellent way to control the critters. If rats are a known or suspected problem, make sure to do things like:Cover all trash cans with tightly fitting, locking lids.
Avoid leaving food or waste out in the open.
Clean up all crumbs and other debris.
Avoid letting things like newspapers, cardboard boxes, or clothing pile up.
Keep grass and other plant material trimmed, and discard the trimmings.
 It’s not always easy to tell how rats are getting in your home. They can enter walls and roofs through surprisingly small and out-of the way access points. However, covering any obvious access points (like holes in a wall or roof) will at least slow them down.Cover access points with wood, foam sealant, or similarly solid material.
For a thorough job, ask a professional to inspect your home and deal with any potential access points they identify.
 Though they’re not a quick fix, “mousers” can be great at controlling rodent problems. It’s true that many cats are excellent hunters, and will pounce on any rats they find, and discourage others from sticking around. You might consider getting a cat for just this reason if you are bothered by the sounds of rats. Cats are not a perfect solution, however.

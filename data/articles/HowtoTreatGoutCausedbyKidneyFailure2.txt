 Elevating your legs helps to treat gout with the aid of gravity. This is because elevating your legs decreases inflammation and swelling and causes the fluid in the joints to return back to proper central circulation.


Elevation also helps uric acid to flow back into the blood stream, which prevents it from building up in the joints. When uric acid builds up in the joints it can crystallize, causing a hard lump.
To elevate your legs correctly, your feet should be higher than heart-level .A 45-degree elevation will do. You can put 3 to 4 pillows at the end of the bed and allow both legs to rest. This can be done several times a day.
 A cold compress slows down blood circulation near the joints by narrowing the blood vessels. This reduces the inflammation causes by excess blood at the affected joints. A cold compress also help to numb any pain.


You can apply a cold compress by wrapping an ice pack in a clean cloth or towel and applying it to the affected joints for no longer than 30 minutes, 3 to 4 times a day. Be sure to allow the area to return to its normal temperature before applying the cold compress again.
Do not use hot packs or hot compresses as this will only make joint inflammation worse. Heat dilates the blood vessels (vasodilation), causing a sudden rush of blood that leads to inflammation, swelling, and pain.

 The first step in protecting your granite countertop is making sure the installation is safe and secure. Because of the granite's weight, your lower cabinets need to be of sturdy construction and affixed properly to the wall. Otherwise, the cabinets may partially collapse, leaving the granite to crack as it falls. A licensed contractor can make the assessment of your cabinets' strength if you are unsure.;
, The next important step in preventing discoloration is to clean up spills. This is especially true for liquids with a deep color like red wine on a lighter granite. Lighter granites are more likely to absorb stains.
 Containers such as olive oil bottles are often hard to keep completely dry, acetone from fingernail polish remover can remove your sealant, cosmetics and beauty aids may contain chemical residues on the outside that will react with your counter over time. Leave these types of containers on a shelf or in a cabinet.
, Cutting directly on the granite will damage your knives. (citation 3)

, One of the benefits of granite countertops is that you can place hot pans directly onto them without causing a burn mark or "thermal shock." The worry would come from a sealant that is not rated for high heat.
 Most granite does not need to be sealed. (Citation 1)


To test if your granite requires a sealant you will need water, lemon, and baby oil and a sample of your stone.
Lemon juice can permanently damage stone that contains calcite.
Only use this test on a sample of stone you do not care about.

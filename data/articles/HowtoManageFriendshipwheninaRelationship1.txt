 Sometimes, you may not be taking a look at the whole picture - you may be just focusing on part of your garden and neglecting all the weeds growing in other places! Ask yourself these questions:


Am I spending enough time with both?
Who am I with most of the time?
Are there more positive or negative feelings in my partner's relationship and my friendships?
Do I feel unhappy with my relationship or friendships?;
, Do you sense negative energy from your partner or friends? If there seems to be a cloudier tension in your relationship, you may want to lay off some time from hanging out with your friends. If it's the other way around, you may be spending too much time in your love life.
 Do you spend too much time tending to your relationship and neglecting the weeds in your friendships, or is it other way around? You can't just focus on one part of the garden, but you must take a look at the whole garden. Where are the weeds thriving more?

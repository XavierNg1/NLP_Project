 Click on the "Event" application link on the left hand column of your page, under the profile picture. Click "Create an Event," and input the name date, time, description and upload a profile picture.


If you cannot see the "Event" link, you should click the "Edit" button below your list of applications. You can find the event application and add it to your page. Take extra care when choosing an appealing name for your event because this cannot be changed in the future.
 Then share the event with all of your page fans. Send an email to your event partners, businesses, friends and colleagues asking them to say they are coming to the event and to send it along to their friends or fans.


Make sure the event is listed as "Public," so that anyone can be invited. If it is a private event, only those who are invited can take a look at the details. Also, ensure you have enabled the ability for people to see who is coming and write on the wall.
 Respond under their comments or go to their personal pages, depending upon what fits the situation better. Ask people, such as authors or band members, to engage regularly on the event page and your Fan Page.
 You can ask trivia questions and say the first person to answer will receive 2 tickets. Do this occasionally to encourage people to keep checking back on your site.
 On the day of the event, encourage people to post their pictures, videos and notes on your page. Moderate the content and remove anything that isn't appropriate.
 These ads are available for a fairly low cost. You can choose the demographic, area and timing of the ad according to what is appropriate to your event.

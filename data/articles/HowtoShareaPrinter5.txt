 Open the Control Panel and select "Devices and Printers". Click the "Add a printer" button at the top of the window. Wait for the scan to complete, and the printer should appear in the list of available printers. Select it and click Next to add it to your computer.


If the printer you are looking for cannot be found, click "The printer that I want isn't listed". You can then manually connect to the printer by entering the printer's network name.
 Open the Control Panel and select Printers and Faxes. Look for the "Printer Tasks" section and click the "Add a printer" option. This will open the "Add Printer Wizard". Select the "A network printer, or a printer attached to another computer".


The quickest way to connect to a network printer is to enter in the network address for it. This means you will need to know the computer name and the printer name. Enter in the address using the following syntax: \\computername\printername.
You can also browse for available printers, though this method is not as reliable as simply entering the name of the printer., Open "System Preferences" by clicking the Apple menu and selecting it. Click on the "Print & Scan" icon, and then click on the "+" button at the bottom of the list of currently-installed printers. The window that comes up will automatically detect any printers shared on the network. Select the one you want to add it to your list of printers.

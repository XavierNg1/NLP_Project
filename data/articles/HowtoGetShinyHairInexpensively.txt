, Use a lot. Rub it all through your hair, trying to apply it to every inch of your hair. It doesn't really matter what brand; just use whichever one works best for you. i suggest Pert. DO NOT RINSE, keep your head OUT of the water.
 Still, do not rinse.
 Bits of shampoo and conditioner will come down, but your hair will still be pretty slick with bubbles. Be GENTLE.
 When your hair is without tangles and slick with bubbles, gently pull it back into a ponytail. Leave it there for the rest of your shower. When the shower is over, remove the ponytail and carefully rinse out the conditioner and shampoo.

 The rule is that multiplying two numbers with opposite signs equals a negative. It does not matter which way the signs are presented. A negative times a positive is a negative, and a positive times a negative is a negative.For example, −2×4=−8{\displaystyle -2\times 4=-8} and 2×−4=−8{\displaystyle 2\times -4=-8}.
 The negative number can show what number to subtract, and the positive number shows how many times to subtract the number.For example, −2×4=−2−2−2−2=−8{\displaystyle -2\times 4=-2-2-2-2=-8}.

Also, 2×−4=−4−4=−8{\displaystyle 2\times -4=-4-4=-8}.

To help students visualize this concept, you can use a number line. Begin at zero, and repeatedly subtract 2 four times.
 Practice problems involving multiplying a negative and a positive often involve adding debt. You can also use any scenario in which something is removed repeatedly.

For example, “Rob takes out a $5,407 loan each college semester. He attends college for 7 semesters. If he starts with 0 dollars, how many more dollars does Rob have after college?”

In this case you would multiply −5,407×7=−37,849{\displaystyle -5,407\times 7=-37,849}. This means that Rob loses $5,407 seven times, so he has -$37,849 more dollars after college. In other words, he has a debt of -$37,849.



Another example: “There are two cafes on Main Street, Steam Queens and Bean Kings. Bean Kings averages 150 customers a day. When they stop using fair trade coffee, they begin to lose 10 customers every day. How many more customers do they have after one week?

In this case, you would multiply −10×7=−70{\displaystyle -10\times 7=-70}. This means that after one week, Bean Kings has -70 more customers, which, in practical terms, means they have 70 fewer customers after one week.

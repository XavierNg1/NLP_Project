 If you feel pain in your lower back that radiates along the path of sciatic nerve (through the buttocks, thigh, and lower leg), you may be suffering from sciatica.


Sciatica pain is often described as sharp, burning, needlelike, or tingling.
In some cases, sciatica can be more localized around the buttocks, with radiation in the thigh, but no pain at the lower back.
The specific pain pattern will differ from person to person, and is mainly tied to the underlying cause of the sciatica.
Pain is usually present in one leg, but can affect both in some cases.
 Muscle weakness can occur during sciatica, due to the irritation and inflammation of the nerve.


Pain and muscle weakness can be so severe that it can affect your lifestyle and daily activities.
The pain could be triggered by walking, bending forward or backward, and prolonged sitting or standing.
In some cases, pain can get worse even with coughing, sneezing or hard laughing, although it usually recedes after.
 If your symptoms become especially acute, it is necessary to seek medical attention to prevent complications from developing. These signs include:


Progressive weakness or numbness in your lower leg or thigh
Inability to control your bladder or bowel movement

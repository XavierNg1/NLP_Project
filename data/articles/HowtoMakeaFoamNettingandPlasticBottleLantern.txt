 Cut off the base as well. See image for the cutting proportions. This will form a cylinder from the bottle.
 Cut to fit around the cylinder. Most importantly, it should not exceed the height of the bottle. As such, measure to ensure that it is under the neck end and above the base end.
 As shown in the image, trim the edge to ensure that it looks neat and pretty, with all the angles aligned and even.
 Adjust to ensure that it is sitting straight.

Add a tea light into the center of the lamp, on the spot where you're going to use it. It might be easier to place it on a plate or other portable surface for ease of movement; that's optional though.
Read the "Warnings" below on fire safety.
Light the tea light. Enjoy the pretty glow.

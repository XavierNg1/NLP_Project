 Do not get the latest one (3 beta). It's full of bugs, even though it has more features. Many an animation has been lost that way. Use Pivot 2.2.5, it's currently the most reliable.;
, Yes just fiddle with all the features and try your hand at animating. you might be a natural. Some are better than others. Your first animation probably won't be amazing though.
, Don't get discouraged when people give negative comments. And try not to be too full of yourself, no one likes a n00b.
 This may take days, weeks, probably months, even years but you will improve.

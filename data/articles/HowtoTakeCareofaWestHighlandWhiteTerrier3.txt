 Use a clicker to reinforce desirable behavior.When the dog does something you'd like it to learn to do on command, click the clicker and give a treat, while saying a command word. Soon the dog will learn to do the behavior on command.


Punishment doesn't work well for Westies.When trying to teach the dog not to engage in undesirable behaviors, redirect it to a positive behavior with a command, click, and treat.
 Westies love squeaky toys. Make sure your dog has plenty of toys to chew on and fling around.This will reduce the likelihood of the dog becoming destructive in your home.


Choose hard rubber or latex toys that your Westie can chew on. Regular chewing is good for your dog's teeth and gums. Avoid toys made of brittle plastic or soft vinyl, as both can be a choking hazard.If you give your Westie rawhide toys, always supervise the dog while they play. These toys can also lead to choking.
 One behavior that many Westies engage in that people aren't too fond of is digging.A westie can dig up your garden or damage the floors in your home with this behavior.


The best way to stop this behavior is to catch the dog in the act and redirect from digging to a trained behavior like sitting or lying down. If you do this routinely, the dog will usually unlearn the digging behavior.
Digging seems to be an acquired habit. If you bring home a new West Highland Terrier and it doesn't dig, that doesn't mean it won't develop the behavior later. So, keep your eye open for this.
 Westies aren't lazy dogs, but nor are they an extremely high-energy breed. One to two daily walks or play sessions a day is usually adequateA total of an hour of exercise is adequate for most Westies.Most Westies will be calm and relaxed indoors if you exercise them twice a day. If you don't, they can become destructive as a way to relieve boredom and let out excess energy.

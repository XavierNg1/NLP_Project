 When you properly pronounce the letter S, your tongue lays against the roof of your mouth. To change this S sound to a lisping TH sound, keep your upper and lower teeth slightly parted, then move your tongue down and forward so that the tip just barely sits between them. Now, try saying the word “lisp”: it should come out as “lithp.” This is the classic lisp, known as the interdental lisp., Press your tongue against the back of your front teeth. This position is somewhere between a true S and the TH sound that characterizes the interdental lisp. This makes the dentalized lisp a slightly less conspicuous version of the interdental lisp., When you do this, air is forced to escape along the sides of your tongue, making the S sound slightly wet. This is known as a lateral lisp. It is perhaps the most exaggerated-sounding of the lisps., This is the hardest lisp to imitate. It produces a somewhat more grating sound, rather drier than the lateral lisp. Gently press your tongue against the middle/back of your palate.

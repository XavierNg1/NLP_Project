 Horses that have raced on a track in the United States will usually have a tattoo on their upper lip. If your horse has this kind of tattoo, you're in luck. The Jockey Club offers a free tattoo lookup service.You can use this service either by contacting the Club directly or via its official site., The upper lip tattoo used for racing horses almost always follows a recognizable pattern &mdash: first a letter or symbol, then a series of numbers. There are a few things you can learn from this "code" even if you don't contact the Jockey Club:


If the tattoo starts with a letter, the horse is a thoroughbred. The letter corresponds to the year of its birth. Click here for a guide to which letter matches up with each year.
If the tattoo starts with an asterisk, the horse is an appendix horse (a cross between a thoroughbred and a quarter horse).
 The symbols used in a horse's brand can reveal clues about its age, breed, birthplace, and more. Ranches and farms often have their own unique brands â€” other times, breeders use systems of symbols to encode information into the brand. Unfortunately, since brands vary widely, there isn't a single convenient way to figure out what your horse's brand means, but a quick search engine query or a call to your breed registry should get you started.
 When it comes to horses, there can be a surprising amount of information in a name. While not all names carry significant meaning, many horses are named after an important sire (male ancestor). Some are even named after the location where they were raised. This varies greatly by breed and bloodline.


As an example, Shire horses will often use the name of the barn or farm they were born at as part of their names.

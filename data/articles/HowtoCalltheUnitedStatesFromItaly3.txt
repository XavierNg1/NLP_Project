 Try out the popular Skype service to make video or voice calls to anyone in the world who has Skype on their phone or computer. You can also make calls to any phone number, whether or not there is an associated Skype account, for a small fee.


Make sure you are connected to a computer or phone with high-speed internet when you make calls from Skype, as quality audio and especially video are dependent on a good connection.
Note that if you use a Skype app on a mobile phone that is not connected to WiFi, you will incur data charges. Check with your phone or SIM card provider on these charges, or purchase a plan with unlimited or a large amount of data if you will be using phone apps frequently without an internet connection.
 Try another service with audio and/or video calls available, like Google Hangouts, Viber, or WhatsApp. Like Skype, calls through these services are free to another member of the service and have a small fee for calling other landlines and cell phones.


These services can be used on the computer or through free apps for your mobile phone. Remember that if your phone is not connected to the internet, you will incur data charges for audio and video calls.
 Load contacts, phone numbers, and credit for calls on an internet phone service or app before you use it to call the U.S. from Italy. Familiarize yourself with the process of making a call, the quality of the audio or video, and any other features so that you are ready to use it in Italy.


It’s a good idea to be prepared with a reliable microphone and pair of headphones for making your calls from Italy. These are particularly important if you are using an older computer that doesn’t have a microphone or speakers built in, or you want to be able to make calls from a cell phone hands-free.

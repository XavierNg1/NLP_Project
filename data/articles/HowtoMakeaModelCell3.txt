 To make a cake model, you will need:Cake mix, as well as the ingredients to make the mix
Vanilla icing
Food coloring of choice
Various candies to represent the organelles, such as: blue Mike and Ikes, pink Mike and Ikes, War Heads, Air Heads, sour gummy worms and sprinkles
Toothpicks
Labels

, Use a round cake pan for an animal cell and a rectangular shaped cake pan for a plant cell.


Follow the instructions on the package to bake the cake. You can also set aside a little of the batter to make one cupcake to represent the nucleus.
Let the cake cool completely and then remove it from the pan. Place it on the cake board.
You can also make two 9 inch cakes to layer on top of each other, if you’d prefer a taller cell model.
 Dye the vanilla icing with the food dye, based on the color(s) you’d like to use to represent the cell components.


One option is to make separate colored icings to represent the different layers of the cell. For example, to make an animal cell, you could use yellow icing to represent the cytoplasm, and red icing on the cupcake representing the nucleus.If you are making a plant cell, you can make colored icing to distinguish the cell wall and spread it on the sides of the cake.
 It may be helpful to have a print out or image of the cell to identify the cell components as you place them on the cake. An example of good candies to use as components for an animal cell include:Pink Mike and Ikes for the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.
Blue Mike and Ikes for the mitochondria.
Disc sprinkles for the ribosomes.
Airheads for the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
Sour gummy worms for the Golgi apparatus.
War heads for the vacuoles.
 Type up the labels on a computer. Cut out each label and attach them to the toothpicks with tape before placing them on the cake next to the applicable cell component.


Take pictures of the cake model, and then eat it!

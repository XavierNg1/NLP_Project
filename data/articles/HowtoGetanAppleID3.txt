 You will need to enter an email address that will become your Apple ID. You will be entering your Apple ID whenever you need to log into Apple services. You will also need to enter a good, strong password. It must be at least 8 characters long and contain letters and numbers.


You will also need to create a security question and your birthday to verify your identity if you forget your password.
 There are two check boxes at the bottom of the form. They are checked by default. If you don’t want to receive promotional emails and newsletters from Apple, uncheck the boxes.
 Choose the appropriate card type and enter your credit card details and billing address. If you’d rather not attach a credit card to your account, click the None option. You will need to enter credit card information if you intend on making purchases in iTunes or the App store, but you don’t need it for free items.
 Click Done to create your Apple ID. You will receive an email containing a link that will verify your account. Once your account is verified, you can log into any Apple product or service using your new Apple ID.,

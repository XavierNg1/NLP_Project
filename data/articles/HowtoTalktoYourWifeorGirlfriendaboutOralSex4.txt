 Talking about oral sex isn't just about your needs. As a couple, you've both got a responsibility to help each other enjoy your sex life, meaning you should bring up your own questions about what to do and what she likes when talking about oral sex?


"Do you like when I go down on you?"
"Are there things we can do to make sex more enjoyable for us?"
"I'd like to bring more oral sex into the bedroom for us both -- what do you think?"

, This isn't the time to push your wants and desires, this is about her. Oral sex is frequently something one partner does for the other, letting them relax while you pleasure them exclusively. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't enjoy it and feel comfortable as well (you absolutely should!) but that you should place her pleasure first as long as it falls in your comfort zone.


If she is uncomfortable about oral sex, ask her why. Commonly, women are incorrectly led to believe their vaginas are "dirty" or "shameful," and that no guy wants to be there. Assure her, for you, that this isn't the case.Are there things she knows she doesn't like? Things she knows she loves?

, If you want her to be honest about her feelings, you've got to do the same. Not all guys feel equally comfortable with oral sex, and that's okay -- this is why you're talking about it. In order to best help her oral sex, you'll need to be comfortable too. That means admitting if parts of oral sex make you uncomfortable or, on the flip side, if you'd really like to start going down on her more often than you do now.


What stuff is off limits to you?
What things would you like to add or try in the future?
How do you feel about performing oral sex?, The pressure of making completely pleasuring your partner through oral sex, especially if it is a relatively new act. Instead, use oral sex to "warm up" for things you're more comfortable with. You'll both be more willing to experiment, and you can slowly work up to longer or more intimate acts without the pressure of one person doing all of the work., She is the only one who can say if something feels good or isn't doing much, so listen to her! Assure her that you won't be offended she tells you to try something else, as this is the only way to learn what works for her body. Even more importantly, have her clue you in when you're doing something good, helping you focus in on the things she needs and loves.


Listen to her voice, moans, and body language as well. Remember to pay attention to her, not yourself, for the best experience.
If she's not comfortable talking during sex, or giving feedback, consider a simpler system -- perhaps she can tug your hair lightly if she likes something, or she'll tap your shoulder if what you're doing isn't quite working.
If she seems to enjoy something, keep doing it. Pleasuring your partner is not some complex game of chess -- stick to what works!, New positions, experiments, and tricks are an exciting part of your sex life, but that doesn't mean they should be surprising! Asking consent doesn't mean killing the mood or stopping sex in it's track -- you can easily make it a part of foreplay or light dirty talk (ex. "I really want to ______, would you like that, baby?"). Consent is an ongoing process between lovers, not a single conversation, but this actually makes it easier to stay on the same page in bed. If you're trying to bring oral sex into your sex life with some spontaneity, first say:


"Would you like if we tried ________"
"Do you want me to continue?"
"I'm going to _______. Tell me if you don't like it!", A good place to start might be things you thought you did well, suggesting "did you like it when I tried __________" or "would you like if I kept doing __________ more often?" Don't pressure her for an answer -- many times she will be too engrossed in the sex to stop and think about what she liked -- but just asking is a good way to show her that you her pleasure is a priority.

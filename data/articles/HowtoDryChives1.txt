 Rinse them under cold running water and remove any dead or withered chives. Pat them dry with a clean towel or kitchen towel until all moisture is removed.;
, Gather the chives into loose bundles that you can easily hold in one hand. Secure the stems with kitchen twine or a rubber band, ensuring that they stay together securely without crushing them.Trim off the excess bottom and top portions of any stems that stick out if you want the bundles to look even.
If you are cutting the chives from a garden, trim them early in the morning after the dew has dried when they are the healthiest and full of flavor.
 Cut small holes or slits in the sides of the small paper bags to allow airflow. Gather the top of the bag together with string and hang the chives inside the bag from the top.The bag prevents dust from gathering on the chives and keeps sunlight from bleaching out their green color.
 Leave them for approximately two weeks until they are brittle to the touch.


Check the chives every few days to ensure that no mold has developed on them.
 Remove the chives from the bags and bundles and place them on parchment paper or a cutting board. Gently crumble the chives with your hands or chop them with a knife into small pieces.

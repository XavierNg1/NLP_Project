 This is an ideal approach if you have developed a recognizable, online presence in one or more specific forums.


Send an email or private message to the current forum administrator and express that you are interested in becoming an administrator.
 Even if you have not held the official role as forum administrator, you can still demonstrate that you have experience in forum participation and with helping other community members.


Include links on your resume to the online forums you have been participating in. In most cases, prospective employers will join or visit a particular forum to read and review your posts and discussions to verify that you are a qualified candidate for a forum administrator position.
 Some websites will pay you to be an administrator; whereas other websites may be looking for volunteers. Examples of search phrases you can use are "forum administrator," "forum moderator," and "forum leader."


Visit major job search websites such as Monster, Indeed, or CareerBuilder to find online forum administrator positions on the Internet.
Go to any search engine such as Bing, Google, or Yahoo, and look for online forum administrator openings.

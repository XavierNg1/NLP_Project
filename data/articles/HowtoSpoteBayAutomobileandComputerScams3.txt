 First, whenever you buy anything expensive, be sure to check your seller's reputation thoroughly. Make sure they have sold items of a similarly high value before, and haven't just sold a string of $10 items to get their feedback rating artificially high. If you want to be even more cautious, insist that the money is placed in an escrow service (eBay recommend escrow.com - don't use any other service unless you're sure of it).

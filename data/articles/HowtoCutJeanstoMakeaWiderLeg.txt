 To work well, the opening should not extend any further up than 1 inch below the knee.;
,


Try to keep your insert fabric close to the weight of the pants fabric. Denim with denim, twill with twill, etc.
Choose a patterned fabric, an alternating color, or paint or embroider on your insert for contrast. You might also match the color and weight closely for a more a subtle version.
 You will sew the top of these slits closed (so that it doesn't tear anymore) later, when you add the insert (known as a 'gusset').
 You will sew this back into place later when you hem the edge of the gusset.
,,


Be certain the diagonal cut is slightly longer than your slit length.
When measuring where the bottom cut should begin, keep in mind that you are cutting twice the width that you are looking at because of the fold in your material (e.g. 4.5 inches will open to 9 inches).
The reason for doing two pieces at once is to ensure that your gussets match in size and shape.
,,, It is best if you use the same amount of seam allowance as was used to create the pants.
, This will reinforce both your long seam as well as the top of the slit opening. You may want to backstitch several times over the top point of the slit to prevent unraveling later.


As you top stitch, you will need to hold the area being sewn flat while allowing the pant leg to bunch up around the presser foot.

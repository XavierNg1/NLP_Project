 To do this, press the "Start" button, and then click on "Control Panel." From the window that appears, double-click on "Programs." Finally, click "Programs and Features.";
, Once the list of software on your computer has been populated, scroll down until you see the entry for your registry cleaner. Click on it to highlight it, and then either click the "Uninstall" button or the "Change" button (whichever button is available).
 When prompted for the administrator password, type it in, and click the "Uninstall" button. Windows will then remove the application completely; the whole process should only take a minute or so. If a dialog box appears that indicates the removal was unsuccessful, you will have to try another method to remove the software.

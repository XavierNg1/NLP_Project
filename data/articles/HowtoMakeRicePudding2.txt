 At this time, you can also grease your casserole dish.
 You can use leftover rice from the night before, or you can make it fresh. If you are making it fresh, you will need about ½ cup (115 grams) of dry rice (preferably medium-grain) and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water. If you want to make the rice fresh, do the following:


Put ½ cup (115 grams) of dry rice (preferably medium-grain) and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water into a saucepan.
Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat.
Cover the saucepan, then reduce the heat to low.
Simmer the rice over low heat for 15 minutes.
Fluff the rice up using a fork. Leave it in the saucepan.
 Crack the eggs directly into the casserole dish, then beat them with a whisk until the yolks break and combine with the whites.
 Keep stirring with the whisk until everything is evenly combined. You do not want there to be any streaks of unmixed egg yolk.
 Don't worry if the mixture looks wet and soupy; the rice will continue to soak up the liquid as you bake it. Adding raisins is traditional, but if you don't like them, you can leave them out.


For a twist, soak the raisins in 1 cup (240 milliliters) of bourbon or whiskey for 1 hour before adding them to your pudding., Place the casserole dish inside of a larger pan (such as a baking pan or a roasting pan). Fill the larger pan with 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of water.
 Carefully place the pans into the oven. Bake the rice pudding for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Every 30 minutes, open the oven door, and give the pudding a stir., Serve it while it is still hot. If you'd like something a little more refreshing, let the rice cool to room temperature first, then let it finish cooling in the fridge. To prevent a skin from forming on top, press a sheet of plastic wrap over the surface of the rice pudding; be sure to remove it before serving it.

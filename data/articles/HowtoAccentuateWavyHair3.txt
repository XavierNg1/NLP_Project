 A great way to set and enhance waves or curls is by gently making twists all over the head about an inch thick. Remember not to pull the hair too tight as you twist. The twists will naturally spring up, but you can scrunch afterwards too. As your hair dries, the twists will loosen, but not all the way. Use a wide tooth comb to tousle them, after they completely dry.
 Braids work great to accentuate wavy hair. Before you go to bed, braid your hair in one or more braids and take them down in the morning. If you get frizzy hair from sleeping on it, you can run a little bit of conditioning styling cream through the ends or anywhere else you have flyaways.Braid wet hair in one big, loose braid. Twist the braid into a bun, and clip your hair a few inches below the crown for some lift.
Create four braids around your head for tighter texture and extra volume.
 While your hair is wet, place your part where you want it in your final look. After this, divide your hair into four sections and twist each section into a bun. Secure each bun with a large u-shaped pin, so you don’t create an elastic mark from hair ties. Take your buns down in the morning for beautiful, loose waves., This is an easy way to enhance waves around the face and eyes. While your hair is damp, tuck the hair behind your ears and use flat metal clips right above your ears to set the wave. After the hair dries, un-clip and un-tuck for perfect movement around your face., Waves should be tousled and loose. After you’ve completely dried your hair, pick areas out with a wide-tooth comb to break up any waves that may be too defined. You can use your fingers to tousle waves as long as you use a light touch.

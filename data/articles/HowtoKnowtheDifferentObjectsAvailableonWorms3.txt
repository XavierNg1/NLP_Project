 Open the game app, “Local Game,” and select which game mode you will play in (Campaign, Quick Game, Practice Match, Body Count, and Pass ‘N’ Play).;
, Your Worms and your opponent’s Worms are randomly scattered on the map. Find where your Worms are and take a note of their locations; these Worms are your main units in the game. It is also worth noting where the enemy Worms are.


Each team’s Worms are properly color-coded.
 Maps are usually generated in random. Before you begin, it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with the whole map. Swipe across the screen to see it. Identify the different objects you can find on the game map.
 Oil drums are explosive. They burst when hit, spreading fire on the ground near it. Any Worm caught in the explosion and in the resulting fire will have its health or life bar decreased. You can use oil drums to generate more damage against your target Worms by hitting them on your move.


Be careful not to leave your Worms unattended near oil drums to avoid a similar fate.
 Mines are generated at random locations in the game map. A mine is triggered and detonated when a Worm touches it. It can explode immediately when triggered, or it can take up to three seconds. A mine can also be used as a weapon, which you can drop beside an enemy Worm to blow him out.


Avoid mines at all cost when moving your Worms.
 Crates are boxes that randomly appear or get dropped across the game map. When a Worm touches a crate, it gets to collect whatever surprise is inside. A crate can contain a weapon or a utility, or can explode. There’s no telling what you get when you collect a crate.
 Health packs sometimes appear in random on the game map. When a Worm collects a health pack, it will increase its health or life bar. If you have a Worm that needs a health recharge, have the worm collect these.

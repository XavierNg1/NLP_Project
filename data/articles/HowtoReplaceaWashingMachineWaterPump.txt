 Supply hoses, fittings, drain hoses, and the washing machine tub can all be the source of a leak, and water failing to be discharged from the tub during the spin and rinse cycle can be caused by a failed water pump coupling or other problems.;
, You may find a replacement part at a local appliance repair shop, or search online for suppliers.
 Taking it out onto a patio or driveway will allow you to get to the part you need to change.
 The Whirlpool machine in the illustrations is easiest to work on if it is laying on its left side facing the machine; other machines may be configured differently.
 The hoses are soft and flexible, so it should be easy to slide them free if the clamps are loosened sufficiently.
 You can either pull them from underneath the pump with needle nosed pliers, or pry them off by inserting a flat bladed screwdriver between the clamp and the base of the pump and then twisting it. The rear clamp is identical to the front, but since it is difficult to see, you have to remove it by feel.
 The coupling will usually slide free without any problem, if it doesn't, it may have a snap ring or other device locking it in place. You may have to twist the motor and pump slightly on its suspension to give you enough room to remove the pump.
 If anything seems out of place or incorrectly sized, your new pump probably will not work.
 If the pump doesn't slide on easily, you will need to rotate either the shaft or the pump impeller so it will.

 A good dabbing job will take most of the wine out of the carpet, but usually not all of it. To help get the rest out, try covering the stained spot with a generous portion of salt. The salt granules will gradually draw the moisture in the stain out of the carpet over the next few hours.








Since the salt works by absorbing the stain's moisture, this is much less effective for dried stains. If your stain is getting dry, pour a little water on it first before adding the salt.;
, As it absorbs the wine, the salt will gradually turn pinkish. You're ready to proceed when the stain seems almost completely dry. However, longer treatments aren't going to make things worse, so if you have time to spare, feel free to let the salt sit overnight.
 Scoop away the loose salt with a spoon and throw it out. Use a vacuum to suck up the fine particles that remain and get your carpet looking brand-new again. The stain should be gone or at least greatly diminished.









If a salty residue remains after the first vacuuming, just dampen the area with a little cool water and vacuum again to restore its natural texture.

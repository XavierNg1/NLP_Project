 You can’t do everything perfectly, which means you’re going to get constructive feedback every once in a while. This is how each of us learns and builds our career skills. So when you do get constructive feedback, try to take it with a positive attitude.


Keep in mind that not everyone’s great at their feedback delivery, so don’t take it personally if it comes out blunt and seems a tad insensitive. Instead, just focus on the part that you can learn from.
 If a boss sets out a plan of action and you can rise to the occasion and meet it––well, how many ways can you say “raise” and “promotion”? At the end of the day, however, you know what matters even more than raises and promotions: the feeling of doing meaningful work in a team that fosters your talents and being appreciated and valued for the good work you do. Focus most on how you can do your part in the equation and see the world rise up to meet you.

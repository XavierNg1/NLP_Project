 You want to protect the newspaper from air, light, and pests. Newspaper-specific storage boxes are available from conservation suppliers and most craft stores; however, a simple cardboard or wooden box will do as long as it is acid-free.Boxes and sleeves used for storing film are also appropriate.
 To prevent the degradation of the newspaper material, you need to store it in an appropriate place. This means somewhere dark and cool with no humidity or moisture in the air. There should be no light, natural or otherwise.Your newspaper storage area should be between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (or between 15 and 21 degree Celsius). Humidity should be between 40 and 50 percent.
Places that fluctuate in temperature or acidity – like garages, basements, or attics – are not ideal.
 If you wish to have the newspaper out of a box, consult a framer for the best type of glass and frame. You will want a backing board that is acid-free, and you will want your glass to block UV light. Remember that when you display newspapers you still need to keep them in dry, dark, cool places.If you are framing a newspaper clipping, mount it to an acid-free and lignin-free album page using acid-free and lignin-free paper photo corners. Using tape, glue, or paper that is not acid-free can cause damage to the clipping.

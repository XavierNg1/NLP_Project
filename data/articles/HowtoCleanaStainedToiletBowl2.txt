 Hard water stains are both common and unsightly. Fortunately, you can remove them using items you may already have at home. One choice is lemon Kool-aid. Simply sprinkle one package of lemon Kool-aid around the toilet bowl, wait one hour, and use a toilet brush to scrub away stains.Lemon Kool-aid is available at most grocery stores for a little as $0.25.
 Pumice stones are excellent at scrubbing away hard water stains. Use a pumice stone you already have at home, or purchase a "pumie" (a pumice stone on a stick designed for this purpose). Soak your pumice stone in water for 10-15 minutes, then use it to scrub away stains., Dryer sheets are another great product for scouring away hard water stains. In fact, used dryer sheets seem to work even better than brand new ones! Wear a pair of rubber gloves, then use an ordinary dryer sheet (used or unused) to scrub away stains.

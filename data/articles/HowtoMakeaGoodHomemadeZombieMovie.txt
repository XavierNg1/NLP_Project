 Without them you will not have any reason to make this movie. If you are using guns, I suggest battery airsoft guns. They make the noise while not shooting any bullets. (Make sure it's charged, though.);
, After you're done, re-read it and make some changes. You might want to send it to some of your friends to see what they think about it. Also, go over it with your actors and see if anything should be added, deleted, or edited.
 You should get some fake blood with it, and put it where necessary. (Prepare for a lot of shirts to get ruined.)

, Make sure the actors don't do anything inappropriate or dangerous unless you get them to sign a contract. Make sure they act like their age. (Like a kid acting as one.)

, If you are not using any music that you did not create. Try to contact them through the internet. Don't put it on YouTube or any other site or you are going to have a major problem. (Don't just do this to contact them!)

, You worked really hard on this, so why not show it to everyone! (Don't sell the movie if you have any copyrighted audio. This could get you sued.)

 Whatever the violation—whether it is overstaying a visa, obtaining a visa under false pretenses, or taking part in a sham marriage in order to obtain a green card—you will report it to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. If you want to report a suspected violator, you should gather as much information as possible about the person you want to report and what you think they did. At a minimum, try to gather the following:The alleged violators name and any aliases they may use.
Their home and work addresses.
Their exact date of birth if possible, but if not, their approximate age.;

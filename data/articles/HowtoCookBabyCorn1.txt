 Rinse the baby corn under cool, running water, then dry it with clean paper towels.


Fresh baby corn may have silks attached to the cobs, so you'll need to pull these silks away while rinsing them.
If using frozen baby corn, thaw the corn before use and rinse away any remaining ice crystals.
If using canned baby corn, drain the liquid and rinse the corn before use.
 Using a sharp kitchen knife, trim the thick stem ends off each cob of baby corn. The rest of the miniature cob can be left whole.


Since baby corn is so small, it's often left whole when cooked and served. If desired, however, you can cut the corn into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes, cut the corn into 1-inch (2.5-cm) diagonals, or slice each mini cob in half lengthwise. Note that cut baby corn requires less cooking time than whole baby corn, however.

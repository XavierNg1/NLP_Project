Hold a medicine ball in your hands in front of your chest. For beginners, make sure you are holding the medicine ball as closest to the chest as possible. Lean back so your back is at a 45 degrees angle.
From this neutral position, slowly rotate your body to the right. For beginners, you can rotate about 45 degrees. Advanced users can twist up to 90 degrees. Make sure you do not bounce at the end. Hold the position for a second and then slowly return back to the neutral position.
Pause for one second and repeat to the other side.
For more advanced users, you can bring the medicine ball further away from your body. This is an excellent exercise to strengthen the core, which helps with back pain.

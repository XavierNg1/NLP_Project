 To use the flat iron to create crinkles, you need to divide your hair into manageable sections. Divide your hair in half, and then separate one side into smaller sections. The sections of hair should be around one inch (25 mm).


You will do the same thing with the other side when you finish styling the first side.
 Hold the section of hair away from your head. Clamp the flat iron around the section of hair near your scalp. Then, bend your wrist down to create a crinkle. You are almost folding the hair under itself with the flat iron. Hold for a few seconds., Move the flat iron down your hair to the next straight section. Right under the crinkle you just made, clamp the flat iron down. Bend the wrist the opposite way you did to begin with, like you are folding the hair over the crinkle you just made. This should make another crinkle., Go down the strand of hair bending the flat iron back and forth until you get to the ends. This should create a crinkled strand. Repeat this bending and folding for each part of your hair you sectioned off. Run your hands through your hair when finished.

 Especially if you are nearing the registration deadline, you may choose to register in person. Go to your the election office at your town or city hall. Officials at that office should be able to provide you with a voter registration form.A list of all town hall addresses can be found at http://www.ct.gov/sots/LIB/sots/ElectionServices/lists/ROVOfficeAddresses.pdf.
 You may wish to complete the form while at town hall, or take the form with you, complete it at your leisure, and then return it. Fill out all required fields on the form. You will be required to provide your name, address, date of birth, telephone number, and enroll in a political party. There is also a space for your driver’s license ID number. If you do not have a Connecticut driver’s license, you may provide the last four digits of your social security number instead., Your signature indicates that all the information on the form is true. You are also verifying that you meet the eligibility requirements to vote in Connecticut. If you neglect to sign the form, the election officials should point it out to you and have you complete it., When your registration form is complete, hand it in to the election officials at your town hall. They will accept it and then process it to complete your registration.

 Sometimes you can lose track of your specimen's information, such as where and when it was found. It is good idea to keep track of your specimen in a catalog or database. Handwritten catalogs are usually messy and unprofessional. Use Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to create one of these. Put in the object's discovery date and place, if a fossil or artifact: age, and some interesting facts.
 As with the catalog, it is not a good idea to have your labels handwritten. On your label include the object's catalog number, general keyword, and location of discovery.

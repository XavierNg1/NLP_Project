, The wood can be a simple rectangle or you could choose a design, such as an animal, flower or house. Pieces of wood already cut into such shapes can be found in craft stores or you can fashion one yourself with a jigsaw. You might like to paint a design on the wood before adding the spoon hooks or sand and finish the wood attractively.
 Bend into a U shape but not too much––leave the tail of the handle pointing more outward than back toward the spoon.
,, Then drill the screw into the wood, through the handle, aligning carefully with each marked spot on the piece of wood or use liquid nails.
 Hang near the front or back door for ease of finding your keys. Keys are slipped over the hooks in the same way as any key hanger hook.

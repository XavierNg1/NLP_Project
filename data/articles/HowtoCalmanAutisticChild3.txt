 The vestibular system contributes to balance and sense of spatial orientation. Vestibular exercises help to calm the child down using swinging or rocking motions.Repetitive motions sooth and refocus the child's attention on their physical sensation.
 Place the child in a swing and gently push them. Adjust the swinging speed, slowing down or speeding up, until your child is calm. If swinging seems to make things worse, stop.


It may be a good idea to install an indoor swing to best incorporate technique. This can be accessed no matter what the weather is.
Some children can swing themselves. In this case, gently suggest they go to their swing.
 Spinning is a stimulating vestibular exercise.This activity will likely stop a meltdown by diverting attention from the trigger and redirecting it to physical sensation.


Office chairs tend to work best because they swivel easily.
Make sure the child is firmly seated and spin the chair slowly to avoid injury.
Some children will prefer to leave their eyes open, while others may close them.

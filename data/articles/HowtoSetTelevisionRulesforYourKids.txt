 Set a predetermined amount of time for your children to watch television each day, and enforce the rule. No more than 2-4 hours is a good idea. Post the chart in a place where your children can see it (e.g. the kitchen fridge, bedroom door, etc.);
, Make sure they understand that you are serious about these guidelines, and enforce that if they are caught watching television when not permitted, or banned, they can expect punishments.
 This way, you can block certain channels while allowing full or limited access to others, most likely news, science, or kid-friendly. If such an option does not exist, however, write down a list of what channels they are permitted to view, and when.


When they're caught viewing dangerous / unapproved channels, follow through with punishments (grounding, timeouts, cancellation of privileges, extra chores, etc.)

, Check in with them every so often to ensure that they are watching the programs you have allowed them access to.

 The substitution method is ideal when one of the coefficients in one of the equations is equal to one. Then, all you have to do is isolate the single-coefficient variable on one side of the equation to find its value.


If you're working with the equations 2x + 3y = 9 and x + 4y = 2, you should isolate x in the second equation.
x + 4y = 2
x = 2 - 4y

, Take the value you found when you isolated the variable and replace that value instead of the variable in the equation that you did not manipulate. You won't be able to solve anything if you plug it back into the equation you just manipulated. Here's what to do:


x = 2 - 4y --> 2x + 3y = 9
2(2 - 4y) + 3y = 9
4 - 8y + 3y = 9
4 - 5y = 9
-5y = 9 - 4
-5y = 5
-y = 1
y = - 1

, Now that you know that y = - 1, just plug that value into the simpler equation to find the value of x. Here's how you do it:


y = -1 --> x = 2 - 4y
x = 2 - 4(-1)
x = 2 - -4
x = 2 + 4
x = 6
You have solved the system of equations by substitution. (x, y) = (6, -1)

, To make sure that you solved the system of equations correctly, you can just plug in your two answers to both equations to make sure that they work both times. Here's how to do it:


Plug (6, -1) in for (x, y) in the equation 2x + 3y = 9.

2(6) + 3(-1) = 9
12 - 3 = 9
9 = 9


Plug (6, -1) in for (x, y) in the equation x + 4y = 2.
6 + 4(-1) = 2
6 - 4 = 2
2 = 2

 Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water before preparing the drink. Make sure you have a clean pitcher or bottle ready., To make your own ORS solution, youâ€™ll need:


table salt (such as Kosher salt, iodized salt or sea salt)
clean water
granulated or powdered sugar

, Add a half-teaspoon of table salt and 2 tablespoons of sugar into a clean container. You can use granulated or powdered sugar.


If you don't have a teaspoon to measure, you can use a fistful scoop of sugar and a three-finger pinch of salt. But, this is not accurate and is not recommended., If you cannot measure out a liter, add 5 cups of water (each cup is about 200 ml). Only use clean water. The water can be bottled water or recently boiled and cooled water.


Be sure to only use water. Milk, soup, fruit juice or soft drinks cannot be used since they will make the ORS ineffective.Don't add any extra sugar.
 Use a spoon or whisk to mix the ORS powder into the water. After a minute or so of vigorous stirring, the solution should be completely dissolved. Now, it is ready to drink.ORS solution can be refrigerated for 24 hours. Do not store it any longer.

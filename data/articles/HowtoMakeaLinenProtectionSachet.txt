 If you are making more than one sachet, make several.;
, Sew or tie the sachet together. If you are storing the sachets between linens, they are better sewn as they will sit flat between the linens and there is less risk of the sachet opening and spilling its contents everywhere.
 You will get a wonderful scent emitting as you crush it.
 The sachets will work for at least 6 months. Replace when the scent fades.

 Scroll down your Buddy List to see who’s available to chat with and double-click on your friend’s name to open a Chat window with him/her.
 The Chat window will look like all typical chat windows. Your message text box will be at the bottom section while the chat threads will appear at the top section. Type in your message in the text box.
 To send the message, just press Enter on your keyboard. The message will be sent and you can see it posted on the conversation thread above.
 You will be notified if your friend is replying to your message. You can even see it displayed: “is typing . . .” A notification tone will sound once his/her message has been sent, and you will be able to see it in the conversation thread area.

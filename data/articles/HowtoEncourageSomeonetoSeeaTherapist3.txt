 What your loved one says in therapy is generally protected and kept private.Remember that these laws differ by state and by country, but all therapists are required to disclose the details of confidentiality verbally and in writing. You can ask for a copy of their informed consent agreement prior to making the appointment.
 Remind your loved one that it can be very relieving to cry or to talk about a problem with someone else. According to recent surveys, nearly 89% of people feel somewhat better after having an emotional release like crying,and doctors widely recommend talking about problems as a means of finding relief.Try telling your friend or loved one, "It's okay to open yourself up to someone. It's what we do to friends and significant others. You need to build a relationship with a therapist, and open honesty is the only way to do that."
Remind your loved one that it can be scary dealing with feelings, especially if they have been suppressing them, but that therapists are trained to help clients process and deal with strong feelings in a way that is safe and to prevent being overwhelmed.
 The worst thing that could happen from going to therapy is that nothing will change. But the best-case scenario is that your loved one will find comfort, relief, and a new perspective on life.


Reiterate to your friend or loved one once again that you care about her and are there for her, no matter what happens.
Encourage your loved one to be open and honest with their therapist and explain to their therapist what is not working. The therapist may have a different approach to try or may help your loved one find a therapist who is be better suited to help them.

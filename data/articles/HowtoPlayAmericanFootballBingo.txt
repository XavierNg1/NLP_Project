, It's up to you to use the same keywords on every card or have different cards say other terms. This is useful when lots of terms are built up or allow people to have the opportunity to find different things from others.
 Make sure that everyone has enough time so that they know what they're looking for beforehand.
 If the cards won't be used in the future, you can have them cross them out with a marker. You can always preserve them for future games and use tokens or coins to cover them.

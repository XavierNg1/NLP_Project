 Rent a sandblaster from your local big-box hardware store, take your platter out to your driveway, and blast away that mirror finish. This will remove the layer of material which stores the data on the platter. You get to look super cool holding that blaster, plus you can use any extra time with the sandblaster to clean more than just your old hard drive. Fun level: 5

, Well, okay, don’t use a saw (it won’t work very well). Instead, use an angle cutter, which is similar but sounds less cool. These are easily rented from your local big-box hardware store. Use cheap “C” clamps to hold the platter of your hard drive down to an appropriate surface and cut it straight down the middle. Okay, realistically you’re going to cut it more than once because sparks are going to go flying everywhere and it is going to look like the 4th of July in your garage. Whatever makes you happy. Fun level: 7


Just make sure you’re doing all of your cutting safely and with proper eye gear. Look up pictures of angler cutter injuries. You’ll wish you could unsee all that.
 This is a common utilitarian-but-no-less-amusing way to destroy your hard drive. Take a drill (you’re going to need a pretty strong bit) and put holes in the hard disk platter. You’ll want to drill several holes in a wide variety of spots in order to guarantee that the data cannot be recovered. Beyond that, have fun with it. Make art. These things do make great Christmas tree decorations. Fun level: 4

 Locate the Box app on your iOS device. It’s the app with a blue background with the word “box” on it. Tap on it to launch Box.
 If you’re already logged in, you may skip this step; otherwise, input your Box email address and password in the appropriate fields then tap the blue “Log in” button.
 The home screen displays all the folders in your Box account. Scroll through them.
 Navigate through your Box folders as needed by tapping on them. Once you find the file, tap on it to open it.
 The selected file will be loaded on your screen, and you will be able to see its contents.
 On the upper-right side of the preview is a small box with an arrow pointing left. Tap on it to bring out a right panel with file options and menus. Tap “Move this File,” and a pop-up window will appear for you to select the destination folder where the file will be moved to.


Select the destination folder and tap “Choose” from the lower-right side of the window.
 The selected file will be moved to the destination folder you’ve selected. Navigate to the destination folder and view the file from there by tapping it.

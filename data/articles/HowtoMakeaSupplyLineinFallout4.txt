 If you do not have this, you can't make a supply line. You will need to be level 14 and have a Charisma of at least 6.;
, Stand in front of a settler (a random NPC, not someone like Mama Murphy or Sturges). Doing this will allow an option for a supply line at the bottom of the screen. Press the command that it says, and this will bring a pop up menu for which settlement you'd like to send this settler to.
 You can only send 1 settler from each settlement to each settlement. For example, if you send an NPC on a supply line to The Castle from Sanctuary Hills, you can't send another person from Sanctuary Hills to The Castle, and vice versa.
 After the supply line is established, the settler can be seen in the Commonwealth at some points traveling with a Brahmin. You can trade things with them as they're traveling, so if you need some ammo, this is a good idea.

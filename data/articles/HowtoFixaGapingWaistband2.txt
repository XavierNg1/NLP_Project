 If you do not want the look of an elastic waistband, you can sew a small strip of elastic into the back of your pants. This will help to cinch in your waistband in a less noticeable way. Cut a 1 ½ centimeter (½ inch) wide strip of elastic about 15 centimeters (6 inches) long.The length of elastic will vary depending on the size of your waistband. For example, the elastic should reach about half way between the center belt loop and the side belt loop of your pants.
 Turn your pants inside out and center the elastic along the waistband at the back of your pants. To hold the elastic in place, pin it to the pants. Place a pin on either side of the center belt loop, to mark where the belt loop is located.
 Begin near the center of the elastic, on one side of the center belt loop, and use a zigzag stitch. Sew through the center of the elastic until you reach the end. In order to sew a zigzag stitch, select the zigzag stitch on your sewing machine. As you sew, pull the elastic tight and let the material of the pants feed through the machine normally.Then repeat the sewing process, starting on the other side of the center belt loop and sew outwards towards the other side of the elastic.
Remove the pins as you are sewing. Do not sew over a pin because this could break your needle.
Use a thread that matches the color of the pants.

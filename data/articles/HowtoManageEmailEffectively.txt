 Email is for communicating between people; it’s for sending text and visual information from one person to another / many others. It’s not for:


Storing information; it’s better to save information as a document on your computer or in the cloud
Reminding you what needs to be done; rather use a to-do list or calendar for this;
,


Use a ‘follow up’ or ‘respond’ label for things you must do. You should then add these to your diary or ‘to do’ list.
Use ‘awaiting response’ when you’re waiting for someone else
Use ‘urgent’ for things that must be done as soon as possible

,


Download any attachments and save the files in the right place
Then, if you aren’t going to reply to the email, archive it

, Don’t fear Archiving; It basically moves the email from your inbox to a ‘no-name’ box (technically, it removes the ‘inbox’ label)


It’s not gone – that’s what delete is for
It’s always search-able and find-able

, This will keep your inbox free from unnecessary and undesired emails.


Delete emails you weren’t supposed to receive in the first place
These will no longer be search-able or find-able after being in the ‘bin’ for a while
If you don’t want to receive that kind of email again, make sure you unsubscribe from getting it by looking for the ‘unsubscribe’ information at the bottom of the email
If you cannot unsubscribe from it, assign the email as spam

, Use stars sparingly, because having too many starred emails will be as unhelpful as no starred emails.

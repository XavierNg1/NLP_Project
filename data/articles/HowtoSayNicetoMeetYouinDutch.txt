 The closest to "Nice to meet you" would be a singular "Aangenaam" (nice). This is said at the moment you shake hands, usually after the other person has said his name. You still hear this in more formal meetings, especially when there is a difference in status between yourself and the person you meet. (The other has more status).


Very old fashioned people would answer back with 'Insgelijks' (Likewise). This does not even out the difference in status.
"Aangenaam kennis te maken" is another way to say the phrase. However, it's a bit old-fashioned.;
, Perhaps follow by the slightly old-fashioned 'Hoe maakt u het?' (How do you do? / how are you?). Don't expect an answer back to this question.
 In a more formal setting, use "U" instead of "je". "U" is the proper way to to address a person you would address as "Sir" or "Madam" in English.
 Dutch people are generally polite, but being overly polite is considered over the top and is not appreciated in general. Using an equivalent of 'Nice to meet you' makes your own experience of the meeting the more important thing, whereas Dutch people find what you wish the other person to be far more important. So, wish them a good morning/day/evening, even when meeting someone.

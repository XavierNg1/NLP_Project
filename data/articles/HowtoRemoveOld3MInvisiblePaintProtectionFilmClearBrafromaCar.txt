 Be sure not to use a metal scraper as it could scratch the paint finish.


You may use some auto trim tools that are made of poly/nylon and are safe for the paint surface.
Gently stick the edge of the scraper underneath the edge of the film and push against the film to see how easily it will come off .;
, Do not get the heat gun too close to the car, 8–12 inches (20.3–30.5 cm) will work best. Hold the heat gun on the section for about a minute or two. If the film comes off fairly easily and in large strips a heat gun may not be necessary but would help.
 It is Okay and normal for to not get everything off in each pass.


As long as you get the top layer of the film off the rest will come off easily with Goo Gone adhesive remover.
 You will know when you need to heat again as the strips being removed will get smaller. This process will take some time so patience is a must!

, Grab a small microfiber towel and spray some Goo Gone onto it.


Gently rub over the area on the car where the adhesive is.
Work in small sections and spray more Goo Gone on the towel as needed. Rub over the areas until the adhesive has been removed. The plastic scraper can also help on this step.
 Spray down a small area, 2x2, and then rub the clay bar over it.


The clay bar will pull up the rest of the particles that are left and make a nice smooth finish.
, So that it doesn't stand out, you may wish to wax the entire hood or just go for the whole car!

 The best way to get referrals is to just ask for them. This doesn't mean just mentioning to a client that you would like some referrals, but rather, to come right out and ask for referrals and to ask more than once so the client knows you really want them. Your request should be a specific question that your client feels he must respond to, not a passing comment that he can choose to ignore.


You can help customers think of referrals by narrowing down the scope of acquaintances and friends that they might refer. For example, for a hunting product, you might ask, "Can you think of any of your hunting buddies that might be interested in my product?"
This narrows down the potential field of referrals to a smaller group and can help guide your customer's thinking., Purchasing a beneficial product or service gives customers a "rush." Your goal as a business owner should be to request referrals during this rush, when customers are in their highest spirits and most likely to be receptive to offering referrals. For example, try asking right after a customer compliments your product, service, or business. You can also offer a space to provide referrals at the end of a customer satisfaction survey. These are natural places for customers to provide a glowing recommendation of your business., Depending upon referral value, you might make a phone call, write a note, or send a small gift to the referring client. Let the person who made the referral know the outcome. Knowing this will help the customer understand the clients that best fit your product or service and make him feel part of your success.
 Don't stop at gaining referrals from customers. You can also contact complementary or related businesses in your area to work out referral sharing. For example, a hardware store might want to have a relationship with contractors or builders in their area, as they would share many of the same customers. Referring customers between each other will help both businesses grow.

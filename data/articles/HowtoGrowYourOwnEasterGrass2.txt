You might use a hollow rabbit shaped container, or a plain container that can be decorated in Easter patterns and colors. Or, choose one such as a plastic berry container that can be placed easily into the base of an Easter basket rather than going on display.


If you want to be able to grow the grass direct in an Easter basket, line the basket with something waterproof such as plastic wrap, a plastic bag or cellophane. This will prevent the water from leaching into the basket and the soil from going everywhere.
 Pour in enough water to wet and mix through.

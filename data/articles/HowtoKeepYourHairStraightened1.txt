 It's science -- the heavier your hair is, the more it will straighten out under its own weight. So if you want naturally straighter hair (not straight, straighter), grow it out. Shorter hair has more of a tendency to curl up.









That being said, don't avoid the salon and ignore your regular haircuts. Still go in every 2 or 3 months, but only get the ends trimmed. This will actually stimulate growth (cutting off the dead ends) and help your hair grow faster.;
, The only reason those salons that only do blow-drying (seriously?) exist is because very few of us own a good blow dryer. It may seem silly, but "ionic" may not just be a marketing ploy. If you see it on the box, buy it. It may prevent further hair damage.









"Ionic" supposedly means that instead of the water molecule evaporating (like it normally does under the heat), the ionic blow dryers simply break it down, leaving the moisture in your hair. They also do the drying quicker, saving you time. If you blow dry often, they're worth the extra cost., You may think there's one way to blow dry your hair: point the blow dryer at your mop and go. But there's actually more to it to that and it's important that you do it correctly. There are two things you should get down pat:









Use the nozzle on the end -- it's there to protect your hair from the direct heat. And section your hair to keep it straighter, getting faster results.
A large round brush will help smooth out your hair from cuticle to end. It also magically will make it seem shinier as it smooths out your strands.

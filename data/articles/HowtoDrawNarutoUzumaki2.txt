 Draw an oblong for the head, take note that it looks more circular and bigger in proportion to the body as compared to the adult version. Sketch a crossed line on the face as guide when drawing facial features later. Take note of the location of the joints when sketching the body.
 Using the crossed line as guide, draw almond shape eyes, add the nose and mouth. Notice that in manga and anime, child characters usually have bigger eyes in proportion to the face. Don’t forget that Naruto has a unique feature of having three slanted lines on each side of the cheek.
 Use slanted short strokes for the hair to make it appear pointed. Add the headband with the Hidden Leaf Village emblem.
 Take note that anime clothes don’t have a lot of creased lines, so just keep it minimal and simple.
 For the hands, use small elongated shapes that resemble fingers. As for the feet, you can focus on the footwear.

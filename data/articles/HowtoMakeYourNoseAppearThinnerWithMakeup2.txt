 Creating the illusion of more pronounced cheekbones and a thinner face will help take the attention away from your nose. Use the same products to highlight your cheeks and draw contour lines diagonally on your cheeks. Like you blended your nose, use your brush or beauty blender to blend the rest of your contouring.
 If you don't want to go full out with contouring your entire face, you can use products like brush and bronzer to draw attention away from your nose and onto your cheekbones. These products will help you get a more natural look while still adding additional pigments and highlights to your face.
 If you don't want the attention to be on your nose, use makeup to enhance your lips and eyes. Wear a bright or shimmery lipstick or gloss, as this will make your lips standout. If you want your eyes to be the focus, add a bit of eyeliner and mascara to your beauty routine.

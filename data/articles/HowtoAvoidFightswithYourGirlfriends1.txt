 If your bestie is obsessed with beaded purses and you yawn at the sight of them, share your feelings. You don’t always have to love the same things. Being genuine about your likes and dislikes, though, could prevent resentments from building over time. Just make sure that you share your preferences in a polite way.


For example, you might say something like, “Beaded purses are so you and you make them look great! I prefer non-beaded purses.”;
, It's important to stay in touch with your girlfriends often, but in an appropriate way. Periodically texting, tweeting and talking on the phone are great for everyday communication in addition to face to face conversations. Judge your means of communication on the type of communication, however. Twitter is fun, but not the best tool for carrying on a serious conversation. Some ways to keep the lines of contact open include:


Sending a “Good morning” text to brighten a friend's day
Checking in after stressful experiences such as tests or doctors' appointments
Returning messages promptly, even if it's just to say "I can't talk right now; call you later!"
Reaching out to make meeting plans

, If the only time you hang out is during class or on lunch break, you need to schedule some ‘we’ time, stat! Relationships are built on shared experiences. If you’re never even in the same zip code, however, disagreements will grow while your friendship withers. A few fun hangout ideas include:


Arranging to get a pedicure together
Going to see a movie
Working out at the gym or going for a jog

, Is your friend's new haircut horrible? If she loves it then you'd be better off withholding your two cents. Supporting your pals even when they've made questionable choices is part of being a true friend. Offering your opinion, especially when your friend hasn't asked for it, creates a situation where the other person can feel unduly criticized and judged.

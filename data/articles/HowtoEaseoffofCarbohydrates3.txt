 For breakfast, stick to foods that are low in carbs. Trying to plan breakfast and stocking up on the right foods can help.


Breakfast staples like cereal and oatmeal tend to be higher in carbs. Eggs might be a better option. If you're short on time, you can hard boil eggs the night before and eat them with some fruit on your way out the door.
Greek yogurt with low-carb fruit, like strawberries and blueberries, is another good breakfast option.
Breakfast smoothies, made from low-carb fruits and veggies, can also be a good choice. While it's generally better to eat fruits and veggies whole, a breakfast smoothie can work if you're short on time.
 Lunch foods are notoriously high in carbohydrates. Sandwiches and pastas are popular lunch items for many, so be careful when planning lunch.


As stated, you can use lettuce instead of bread for sandwiches. You can also pack pasta lunches made from low-carb or veggie/egg based noodles.Salads can be made into meals in and of themselves with the right ingredients. Add protein, like nuts, eggs, or meats, to make a salad more filling. Have something light on the side, like a cup of soup.You can also use leftovers from dinner as a lunch item. This will save time on preparations and avoid the temptation for carbs that comes with mid-afternoon hunger pangs.
 Planning meals for the week is a safe option when it comes to cutting back on carbs. Oftentimes, when people are low on ingredients and time they opt for fast food or eating out. Have a meal plan ready for each week.


Look for low-carb recipes that are easy to reheat so you'll have leftovers all week long.
Plan meals around sales items to save money. If, for example, squash is on sale look into types of soups and pastas you can make with squash.
Write down your meals for the week on a calendar. If you have time, spend Sunday doing meal prep via cutting up and measuring ingredients.

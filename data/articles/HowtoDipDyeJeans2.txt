 Use bleach to dip dye jeans white, or to prepare dark jeans for color dye. Put on rubber or latex gloves, and then make your bleach solution by combining two parts water and one part bleach in a plastic bucket. Stir the solution with a stick.
 Thread a ruler through the belt loops of your jeans. Plastic or wood is fine. This will weigh down the top of your jeans when the legs are soaking in the bleach solution, preventing the dye from spreading to other areas.
 Lower your jeans into the solution up to your desired dye height. Allow the ruler to rest on on the side of the bucket so that it acts as a weight to hold your jeans in place. Allow the jeans to soak in the bleach for about 30 minutes.








Bleach often runs, so you should allow for an inch of extra bleaching when soaking your jeans.
If you havenâ€™t achieved your desired shade after thirty minutes, continue bleaching until you do.
 After you have achieved your desired shade, remove your jeans from the bleach. In another bucket, prepare a vinegar solution with 1 part water and 2 parts vinegar. Soak your jeans in the solution for 5-10 minutes.








This stops the bleaching process, so make sure you are happy with your shade before beginning this step.
 Lie your jeans flat and allow them to dry. Then, you can add any finishing touches.









You might want to cut holes in the knees of your long jeans or fray the edges of your jean shorts to create a distressed look.

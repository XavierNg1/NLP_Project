 Scrub hard and leave the shampoo in for a few minutes, then rinse and repeat if the smell is still there. This may be all you have to do.;
, Just pour your normal amount of shampoo into your palm and pour some baking soda in and rub your hands together. The amount of baking soda is not exact, maybe around half the portion of shampoo used. Wash your hair with this mixture, leave it in for a few minutes, and rinse.
 Pour a liberal amount of baking soda in a bowl and add water very slowly while mixing the substance until the texture is like a thick paste. Apply this to your hair and put a shower cap over it, then leave it in for at least a few minutes or even overnight. Depending on the extremity of your case, leaving it in longer might be a good idea, but just a few minutes can work too.
, It might even make your hair smell better. Hopefully your hair no longer reeks of vomit!

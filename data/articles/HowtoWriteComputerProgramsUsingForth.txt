 It is interactive and extensible, and consists of the parts described as follows:;
, If the input is a FORTH word, the interpreter tries to execute it. It the input can be interpreted as a number, the interpreter put the value on the stack. It is is neither of these, the interpreter gives a message like "UNDEFINED WORD" or "Huh?" depending on the sense of humor of the person that implemented the version of FORTH.
 Access to a CPU stack is very fast. Access to external memory is much slower. Avoid external memory when things need to be fast, and use external memory when things need to be saved.
 The data stack is usual referred to as 'the stack' and the return stack is specifically referenced as the 'return stack'. In most cases, the user manipulated values on the data stack (the stack), while the return stack hold the value of the routine that called the one currently executing. The return stack is somethings used to temporarily store values within a single function, but care must be taken not to interfere with the return value that must be present at the end of the function.
, The user adds definitions to the dictionary using previously define FORTH words in the dictionary

, The FORTH words (routines) that access memory are usually some form of @ "fetch from memory" and ! "store to memory". @ and ! usually fetch and store values of the default cell size defined for the system. Other size values are C@ and C! for character (8 bit byte), W@ and W! for word (16 bit 2 byte) L@ and L! for LONG (32 bit 4 byte). Other memory access can be defined as EC@ and EC! for EEPROM character fetch and store, and so on depending on the system implementation.
 This is usually the starting point as a reference for a FORTH system. Any variations from the standard are usually stated for the convenience of the intended users.

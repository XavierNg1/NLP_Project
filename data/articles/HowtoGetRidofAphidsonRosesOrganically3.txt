 When sprayed, insecticidal soap smothers the aphids that are present on the rose bush. There is no residual or negative environmental effect and beneficial insects are rarely harmed.


You can purchase insecticidal soap in ready to use spray bottles and in concentrated form., If you purchase the concentrated form, you will need to dilute it so you can put it into a spray bottle.


Mix about 5 tablespoons of soap into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.Shake or stir the mixture until it is thoroughly mixed.
Pour it into a spray bottle.
 The insecticidal soap will not penetrate well enough to kill any aphids hiding within them so it is best to trim off any damaged leaves or blooms and throw them away.
 Do not spray the rose when temperatures rise above 85 °F (29 °C).The higher temperatures could cause the soap to damage the roses’ leaves.
 Leave the insecticidal soap on the rose bush for an hour or so and then rinse it off with clean water.


Don’t leave the mixture on the roses for longer than an hour, as it can cause phytotoxicity and severely damage the foliage.
If the aphids return after one week, repeat the treatment.

 A cubic meter is written m3. It is a unit of volume, which measures space in three dimensions. You can use cubic meters to measure the amount of air in a room, or the amount of water in an aquarium. A cubic meter is an amount of volume equal to a cube one meter long, one meter wide, and one meter tall.


Similarly, a cubic foot (ft3) is equal to a cube one foot long, one foot wide, and one foot tall.
 One cubic meter can fit 35.3 cubic feet inside of it. Notice how this number is bigger than the conversion used above for m2 or plain old meters? That's because you're multiplying the difference three times when you're in three dimensions. The cubic meter is 3.28 times longer than the cubic foot, but it's also 3.28 times wider and 3.28 times taller. 3.28 x 3.28 x 3.28 = 35.3, so the cubic meter is 35.3 times bigger by volume than the cubic foot.


To be more precise, multiply by 35.315 instead.

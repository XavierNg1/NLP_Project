 This method also works with Tabasco sauce. Both are acidic, just like the salt and vinegar method (ketchup is salt and vinegar, with tomatoes!) .
 For the record, with this method, you may be able to smell the ketchup on the penny when you are finished. Tabasco, on the other hand, may leave an orange tint. However, they will be clean!







, If you have a toothbrush handy (preferably your roommate's), after the three minutes are up, scrub the penny, working into the little ridges.
 And if you used your roommate's toothbrush, wash that off, too!









If the pennies are clean, but not shiny, mix a paste of baking soda and water and rub into the pennies. Wash it off and tada!

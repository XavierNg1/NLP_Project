 There are several different ways you can address the message to someone specific or to an entire group:net send name - You can enter a username or computer name on your network to send the message to someone specific. If there is a space in the name, surround the name in quotes (e.g. net send "John Doe").

net send /domain:name - This will send the message to everyone in the specified domain or workgroup.

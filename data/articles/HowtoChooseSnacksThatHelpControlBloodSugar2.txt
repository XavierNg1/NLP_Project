 If youâ€™re looking for an easy snack that will help you control your blood sugar while giving you a boost of protein, Greek yogurt is a great choice. It is higher in protein and healthy bacteria than other types of yogurt. Opt for plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt and top it with half a cup of berries, bananas, or your favorite fresh fruit., Hummus is a dip that is traditionally made with chickpeas (garbanzo beans), tahini (sesame seed paste), and olive oil. You can make your own at home with a blender, or buy different flavors at the grocery store like lemon, olive, or roasted red pepper. Dip high-fiber vegetables like carrots, cucumbers, or zucchini in a couple of tablespoons of hummus for an easy snack., Tuna is a protein-rich snack option that is also high in omega-3 fatty acids that reduce inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity. Try plain tuna on top of a whole-wheat cracker. You can also make a tuna salad with mayonnaise or Greek yogurt and lemon., Adding peanut, almond, or walnut butter to an apple is a great way to combine a healthy carb snack with an added dose of protein. Try slicing any variety of apple into about 10 slices and spreading 1-2 tablespoons of nut butter onto the slices for an easy, delicious snack.

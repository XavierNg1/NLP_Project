 In a normal accident, you would get the other driver’s insurance information and their insurer would pay to have your car fixed. However, because you don’t know the driver, you need to check whether your own insurance will cover the cost of a hit-and-run.


Collision coverage will typically cover damage from a hit-and-run. Collision insurance pays for any damage caused when your car hits another object.Alternately, you could have uninsured motorist property damage coverage (UMPD). However, UMPD is not available in all states, and in some states it does not cover hit-and-run damage.
For example, UMPD will not cover a hit-and-run in California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, or Ohio. In these states, you will need collision coverage., Sit down with your police report, witness statements, and other information. Call your insurer and report the hit-and-run. They may have a claims agent follow up for more information.


Don’t delay. Your insurance company will require that you call within a certain amount of time after the accident. It’s best to call as soon as possible.
Remember to keep a call log of every conversation with your insurer. Write down the date and time of the conversation, as well as who you spoke with.
Your insurer may give you a claim number. Write this down. When you call back, your insurer can use your claim number to pull up your file.
 The deductible is the amount you need to pay before your insurer kicks in and covers repairs. Check your policy for the amount. Generally, you need to pay your deductible to start the repair process. However, some insurers will waive the deductible in the case of a hit-and-run.


If you find the other driver, then your insurer might reimburse you for the deductible.Your insurer will pay a certain percentage of the costs above the deductible—maybe even 100%. Check your policy.

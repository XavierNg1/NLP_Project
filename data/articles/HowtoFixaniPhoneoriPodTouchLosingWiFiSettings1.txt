 The best way to start troubleshooting is to make sure your device is up-to-date. Apple has released updates which claim to resolve issues of flaky Wi-Fi. A system update could solve your issues as well as give you additional features. Open the Settings menu and select “General,” then “Software Update.” If you see any software listed (for example, “iOS 9.1”), that means you can install an update.;
, Updates can take a while, so you’ll need to make sure the battery won’t die.
 If there’s a Wi-Fi network that gives you less trouble than others, connect to it. Software updates can be large files, so you probably won’t want to use your cellular data for an update.
 If you choose “Continue,” your apps will be reinstalled after the update is complete. ,

 Start by removing any dirt and dust on the surface of the floor. You should use a dry dust mop instead of a broom, as the broom could scratch the tiles.Make sure you use the dust mop in any corners of the room and between the tiles. Removing the surface dirt and dust will make cleaning the tiles easier.
 You should then use a mild cleaning solution on the floor to get rid of any stains and dirt. You can use a commercial cleanser or make your own solution using water and vinegar.Combine Â¼ cup white vinegar with two gallons of warm water to make a home cleaning solution. Mop the floor and let it sit for five to ten minutes. The vinegar will help to disinfect, deodorize, and clean the tiles.
You can look for commercial cleaner at your local hardware store or in the cleaning aisle. Make sure the cleaner is made for use on unpolished or unglazed porcelain tiles.
 Once you apply the cleanser, you should let it sit on the floor for about 10 minutes. Then, use a soft bristle brush to scrub at any stains. Scrub in circular motions at the stains until they are removed.You should wipe away any remaining cleaner solution on the floor and then rinse it well with hot water. Do not let the cleanser sit on the tiles after 10 minutes, as it could damage the tile.
 Use a clean towel to dry the floor. Make sure you dry it thoroughly, with no water spots or puddles of water on the floor.You can also open windows in the room and use a fan to dry the floor.

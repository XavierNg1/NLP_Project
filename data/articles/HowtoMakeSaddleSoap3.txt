 To make a pleasantly scented saddle soap that will clean and condition your leather tack or boots, you will need:

Bath-sized bar of glycerin soap






1/4 cup of Lexol leather cleaner (not conditioner)






Couple of drops of lavender, tea-tree or eucalyptus essential oil.
 Break the bar of glycerin into chunks and place in a microwaveable bowl. Heat on medium power for 30 seconds, then remove and stir. Keep microwaving for 30 second intervals, until the glycerin has completely melted.
 Add the 1/4 cup of Lexol leather cleaner to the glycerin and stir well to combine.
 Add three or four drops of your chosen essential oil to the soap mixture and stir to combine.


Lavender, eucalyptus and tea tree oil are popular option, but you could also use lemongrass, bergamot, clary sage or any other pleasantly fragranced essential oil.
 Pour the scented saddle soap mix into a jar or sealable container for storage. Wait until the soap has cooled and set before using.

 Tape off a long "runway" or use an outside walkway to walk down. Let them dress up and walk down the "runway" to fun music. Take pictures with a digital camera or video tape them so you can make them a CD or DVD of their show.
 Not really a game but its fun to pamper yourself. There are loads of websites that do that kinda thing.

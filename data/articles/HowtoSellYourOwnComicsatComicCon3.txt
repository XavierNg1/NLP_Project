 Either be very good at doing math in your head or have your calculator with you and all of your costs and expected profits. If someone comes up to you and tries to hustle a really good deal for a stack of your comics and you can't work out quickly whether or not you're still making a profit or selling them for less than it cost you to produce them, saying yes can cost you financially. Be sure to say "no" or "come back later and I'll seal the deal" if you feel rushed and unable to work this out with care.
Expect low offers and don't be offended. Play the game and reach the bargain that works for you.
Be prepared to pitch your comics. Use the elevator pitch you've already decided upon and embellish it as required. Do not be afraid to sell the comic's virtues––otherwise, how else will people know it's worth reading over other ones? Also, don't expect customers to ask you questions first––in most cases, they won't as they're waiting for you to do the opening.
Large crowds of people, people thumbing through your wares and people simply passing right by your stall can be an exhausting and sometimes demoralizing experience. Be prepared for this and stay positive. This is no different from any market stall experience and if you're prepared to have fun with the experience and simply go with the flow, you'll enjoy yourself and feel less overwhelmed.
 If you're drawing or reading, polite customers (the vast majority of people) will feel awkward about "disturbing" you. Moreover, it is better to stand than sit, to be closer to the front of your table than way back behind it, or even better out in front of it, and to be ready to talk to people as they pass by, holding out an open comic. Try to put yourself in the shoes of the customers and think about what would make you feel most comfortable.
 You may find that one comic does well in eastern US, while another is doing better out west. You'll only discover this by traveling to the various comic-cons.

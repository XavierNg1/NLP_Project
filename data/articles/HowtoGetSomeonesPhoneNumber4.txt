 If you are with the person, try taking their phone. You could do this secretly and hide it, or be open and flirty about it.


Send yourself a text message from their phone, and add your contact to their list.
Look up their number in their phone settings.
 If you have a mutual friend, simply ask them for the person's number instead. This way, you get the number without having to be so up-front about it.
 If you have a phone book, school directory, or archive of coworker phone numbers, look up their number. Use whatever method you have available to find their number.

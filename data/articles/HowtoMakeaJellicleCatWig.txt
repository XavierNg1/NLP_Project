 The most common materials used are pantyhose (cut the legs off and sew up the holes), swimming caps, or crocheted hats.;
, While you can use colors similar to the actual wig, it is easier to use white and color it later, especially if it is going to have stripes or other markings. Make sure the yarn frays easily and is not resistant to dye/ink. Cut it into a generous amount of pieces anywhere between 5 inches (12.7 cm) to 2 feet (0.6 m) in length, depending on which cat's wig you're making. However, don't fray it yet.
 Tie the yarn in the middle; you will then have two pieces about two and a half inches long standing up with a knot in the middle. Do this all over the wig base.
 Once it is frayed, it will resemble the hair of the actual wigs.
 While fabric markers are popular for this, Sharpies may work too if the wig is going to be mostly gray or black (like Munkustrap's, for example). Keep stripes and other markings in mind when you do this.
 While there are exceptions, most of the Jellicles have ears, which are made by twisting two bunches of hair and holding them in place (glue, hair gel, and hairspray are usually used for this). To ensure that the ears don't fall out of place, use some very small rubber bands/ponytail holders around the tips. This will make it look like there are little balls on the tips of the ears, but it will not make your wig look wrong and it is often even seen on professional wigs.

 While bacon is traditionally fried, sometimes frying just isn't an option either due to time constraints or lack of equipment. Fortunately, there are different methods of cooking bacon. This section will show you how to cook bacon using a microwave, an oven, and a grill.
 Place a few strips of bacon on a paper towel-covered plate, then cover the bacon with another sheet of paper towel. Place the plate in the microwave and cook it for one minute. Be sure to watch your bacon, as every microwave is different and your bacon may be finished sooner.The more paper towers you cover the plate with, the more fat the paper will soak up. This will give you crispier bacon.
 Cover a baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack over it. Arrange the bacon on the wire rack and place everything into a cold oven. Turn the oven on and set the temperature to 400°F (205°C). Let the bacon cook for about 20 minutes. For crisper bacon, increase the baking time by a few more minutes.Consider flipping your bacon. Bake the bacon for 12 to 15 minutes, then flip it over. Let it cook for 10 more minutes.Placing the bacon on a wire rack will allow the excess fat to drip down and not puddle around the bacon. It will allow the hot air in the oven to circulate around the bacon and cook it evening.
Placing the bacon in a cold, oven, without preheating it first, gives you flatter bacon and prevents shrinking.
 Start up your grill and set it to medium heat. When the grill is hot, arrange the bacon on the rack. Wait until the bacon starts to turn crispy and golden, then flip it over and let it cook some more. This will take five to seven minutes.

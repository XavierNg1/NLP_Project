 A traditional drink to consume on May eve is May punch, a punch made using fresh strawberries (which are in season), white wine, soda water or lemonade (to taste) and woodruff (since real woodruff is said to have carcinogenic qualities, many people prefer to use artificial aroma for this part). Pour the wine over the herb. It is not added to the punch bowl.


Of course you can make the punch without alcohol, if you prefer. In that case, white grape juice can be substituted for the wine.
 For a May Day picnic, rely on the seasonally available fruits and vegetables to make the most of their fresh taste. In the northern hemisphere, strawberries, blueberries, plums, broccoli and snow peas are just some of the delightful produce you can turn into salads, dishes and desserts.

, The greater the audience, the bigger the required image for viewing. The larger the image, the higher lumen count that is required to maintain clarity of the images.


Small to mid-size audiences are well-served with a 2000-lumen projector, while larger audiences (100+) require a 3000-lumen projector for crisp, clear image projection.



Outdoor daytime presentations typically demand a high-lumen projector.
If youâ€™re presenting indoors, odds are there will be at least some ambient light (to assist your attendees in note-taking, finding their way out of the room to take a call or use the bathroom, and to help you maintain eye contact with the participants).
Generally speaking, if the room is exceptionally dim (almost completely dark), then a low-lumen projector would suffice.
Most presentation environments feature dimmed ambient light, which makes a 2000-lumen projector a wise choice.
 Or are you merely featuring talking points and text with your audiovisuals?)


Highly detailed charts or graphics may require higher lumen counts, while less detailed images and large-font text are well served with a 2000-lumen rental projector.
 Most computers have a "VGA" connector. Some have a digital DVI or HDMI connector, which avoids the signal being converted from digital to analog to be sent down the cable (which was designed for old CRT monitors) and back to digital again, which can cause slight signal deterioration--it's not a big deal, but nice to avoid. Check that you have, or obtain, the correct video cable.
 The audio signal needs to get from the audio/video source to them -- check that you have a proper cable if relevant.
 Some people notice the flickering. LCD projectors can have somewhat less vivid colors and slight ghosting with rapid action in videos (neither is generally noticeable except to video experts) but avoid the flickering.

 The simplest way to root the Droid 2/X is to use the Framaroot One-Click Root program. In order to use this program, you will need to set your phone to be able to install programs from sources other than the Play Store.


Press the Menu button on your phone while on the Home Screen. Select Settings and then click the Applications button. In the Applications menu, check the box next to “Unknown sources”. This will allow you to install programs not downloaded from the Play Store.
 Download the latest version of Framaroot directly to your phone. You can find the links in this XDA thread. The links are at the bottom of the first post.


You can download the file to your computer and then copy it to your phone, or you can download it directly to your phone.
 Once the file has been downloaded or copied to your phone, open a File Explorer program. There are a variety of free file explorer programs available from the Play Store. Open the Framaroot APK file in the File Explorer to install it to your phone.
 Once Framaroot has been installed, click on the icon in your App Drawer to run the program. You will be presented with a drop down menu and a selection of exploits. Most users will want to install Superuser on their rooted phone, so make sure that it is selected in the dropdown menu.
 There will be a couple of exploit choices in Framaroot. Try each one to find one that works. Because systems are patched to fix exploits, what worked before may not work in the near future.


There is no negative effect to trying an exploit that does not work. Try them all until you find one that works. You may have to try the exploit multiple times in order to get it to install.
 The one-click root process can be very quick. Your phone may reboot during the root. Verify that it worked by browsing for the Superuser app.

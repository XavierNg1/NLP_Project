 Both the cow pose and the cat pose are done on all fours, which makes them good poses to do together. Make sure your wrists are directly under your shoulders and your knees directly under your hips.Take a moment in tabletop position to connect with your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose and exhale deeply out your mouth. Take a pause between each breath.
 On an inhale, come into cow pose by dropping your belly towards the floor and lifting your pelvis and chest towards the ceiling. Make sure to keep your shoulders open and your tailbone tucked in.Lift your gaze so that you are looking forward, but take care not to crunch your neck â€“ keep it long, reaching through the crown of your head toward the ceiling.
 If you are doing cow pose by itself, hold the stretch for 5 to 10 deep breath cycles. On each exhale, think of lowering your belly and deepening the arch in your back. On every inhale, lift your sitting bones and open your chest.On an exhale, lift your belly to come back to tabletop position. You can continue to another pose or lower back onto your heels to end the pose, as you did with the cat pose.
 Cat and cow can be performed together as a vinyasa flow. In yoga, "vinyasa" means to synchronize your movement with your breath as you flow between two poses.For the cat-cow vinyasa, start in tabletop. On an inhale, arch your back to come into cow pose. As you exhale, drop your chest and hips and round your back upward into cat pose. Return to cow pose on the inhale.
Repeat these movements 10 to 20 times with a breath for each movement. Keep your breathing slow and deep, and don't rush through the movements.

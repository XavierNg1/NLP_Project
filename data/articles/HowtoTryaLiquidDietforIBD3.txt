 One way to get some nutrients after a flare up is to drink juices that have been watered down a bit. Watered down is best because too much sugar can also cause irritation. However, the juices will provide you with some of the nutrients you need.Low-sugar sports drinks can also be beneficial.
 Although you may enjoy your drinks ice-cold, you may have better luck trying warmer beverages, such as room temperature. Ice-cold liquids can cause you to have cramps, making symptoms worse and causing you more pain., If possible, skip the caffeine altogether. Caffeine doesn't just boost your energy, it also gives a "boost" to your bowels. In other words, it can lead to diarrhea in people who already have bowel trouble, so it's best to avoid it., While you want to get plenty of fluids on a liquid diet, try not to gulp your beverages down. Instead, go a bit more slowly and avoid using a straw. Going too fast or using a straw introduces more air into your system, which can lead to you having extra gas and being uncomfortable., Once your doctor says it's okay, you can start slowly introducing solids, beginning with soft foods. Try adding one new food a day, so you don't overwhelm your system. You can begin with foods like applesauce and oatmeal.Other well-tolerated solids include plain poultry or fish, eggs, plain mashed potatoes, plain noodles, bread (white or sourdough), and canned fruits.

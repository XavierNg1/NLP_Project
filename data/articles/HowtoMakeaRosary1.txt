 A rosary is composed of a crucifix, 53 beads of one color to represent Hail Mary prayers, and 6 beads of another color to represent Our Father prayers. The crucifix and beads are strung in a pattern on sturdy string or thread.


Religious supply stores sell small crucifixes that are suitable for making rosaries. They also commonly sell beads you can use to represent the Hail Mary and Our Father prayers.
Waxed nylon cord is commonly used for making rosaries. Be sure to pick out cord that fits through the centers of the beads you have chosen. The beads should fit the cord easily, but they should not be loose. You'll need about 3 feet (1 meter). ;
, Rosaries are divided into five "decades," sections that contain ten beads each, as well as a smaller section with three more beads. Divide the Hail Mary beads into five groups of ten and one group of three. Place the Our Father beads in a separate pile.
 Use a ruler and an ink pen to mark the cord with a dot about 6 inches (15.2Â cm) from the end. Tie a knot over the dot to begin the rosary. The knot should be large enough to prevent beads from slipping over it to the other side of the cord.

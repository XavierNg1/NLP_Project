 Coping saw blades are made of a thin, brittle metal and will snap easily when bent. Snapping off one end will allow the blade to fit into the lock.


Check the angle of the teeth. Break off the end of the blade which the blade teeth are angled away.
If you don't have a coping saw blade handy you can try other items around your house. Give anything that is a long, thin, rigid, and cylindrical a shot. For example, you can try a barbeque skewer or a bicycle spoke if you have access to them. Usually, such methods have a very low probability of success, especially if the key is wedged deep in the lock.
 Wrap several inches on the unbroken end with several layers of duct tape. If the blade teeth still poke through the duct tape, simply add another layer or two.
 Use the spray nozzle and straw attachment and flood the cylinder with a coating of a lubricating silicone spray. Wipe up any excess spray that comes back out of the lock cylinder.
 Place the broken end of the coping saw blade into the lock cylinder with the teeth pointed upwards. Wiggle the handle end until the blade squeezes in next to the key.


If you are trying to remove a car key that has teeth on both sides of the key, you can slide the saw blade in with the teeth up or down.If you're not having luck gripping one side of the key, turn the blade around and try the other.
 Twist the blade about a quarter turn toward the key, then pull the blade out and slightly toward the side away from the lock. Repeat this action several times until the blade successfully grips the key.


If the key comes partially out, just grip the end with needle-nose pliers and finish removing the key the rest of the way.

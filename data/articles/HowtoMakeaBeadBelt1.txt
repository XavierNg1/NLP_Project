 Next, determine how many beads wide it will be. The simplest way to do this is to string beads, then measure the desired width against the string.
 Give some thought to how the pattern will look if you stop mid-design due to the length of your belt. If you are using a pre-made belt, keeping the width to the same width as the stitches that hold both pieces of the belt together will save on wear and tear. The same goes for making your own belt, though where these seams go will be up to you.
 If you do not know how to bead at all, just follow the directions that come with your loom. Actually, a belt may not be the trickiest beginner project, though you might want to try a bracelet or something of a similar width first. You want the strip to be fit from just before the hole you plan to use in the belt, and the edge where the stitches attaching the buckle is.

 Choosing a great display picture (called DP in WhatsAPP slang) is the first step to impressing a girl on WhatsApp. Use your best selfie, such as a photo of yourself doing something exciting or one from an interesting place you visited.

For example, if you love to play the guitar, use a picture of yourself jamming for your DP. When in doubt, just show off your pearly whites and use a selfie head shot with your best smile.
If you don’t want to use a photo of yourself, you could set your DP to your favorite cartoon character, athlete, or a work of art.   ;
, WhatsApp offers a list of preset statuses, such as "Battery about to die," but you should try to make your statuses unique. Take a minute to think about how you want to represent yourself with your status. It could be a favorite song lyric, movie, or television quote, or you could just make a quick observation about your day.

If you know you and a particular girl both love a song or movie, using a quote in your status could spur a conversation.
 A WhatsApp profile is pretty basic and, unlike Facebook's extensive options, only includes your DP, status, availability, and contact info. However, you can show off what a WhatsApp pro you are by using hacks, such as text formatting.

You can make text in your status or text messages bold, italic, or strikethrough by typing symbols around the word you want to modify. Type asterisks around words you want bold, like *this*. Use underscores around words you want to _italicize_, and tildes around words you want to ~strikethrough~.You can also go to privacy settings and hide your availability, but that might make it less likely that the girl you want to impress will contact you.

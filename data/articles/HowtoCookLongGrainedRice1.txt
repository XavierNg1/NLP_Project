 Long grain rice will expand to triple its size during cooking, so take this into account when deciding how much to make., Adding cold water to the rice and draining it will remove loose starches without losing nutrients. This may result in fluffier rice, although some milling processes leave little excess starch to remove.If you don't have a strainer, simply tilt the saucepan carefully so only the water drains, using a wooden spoon if necessary to keep the rice in.
 Some people prefer to soak the rice beforehand to reduce cooking time and improve the texture, but you can skip this step and still achieve an excellent result.


Use twice as much water as rice by volume and soak for 20 minutes. Drain the water afterward.
 Use twice as much water as rice by volume or slightly more.


Optionally, add salt and oil for flavor.
 Let the pot boil with the rice in it for 1 or 2 minutes, then place a lid over the pot and reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting.


Make sure the lid is on tight to keep in the steam., Long grain rice usually takes about 20 minutes to cook without previous soaking, but you can check earlier if you're worried about overcooking. When ready, the rice has lost its crunch but remains firm. If the grains are falling apart into mush, the rice is overcooked.


Only lift the lid slightly when checking and put it back on as soon as possible to keep the steam in.
 It is now ready to serve or use in another recipe.


Butter or savory herbs such as thyme or oregano make a bland rice dinner appealing. Add them during boiling for a strong flavor or stir in after the rice is cooked.

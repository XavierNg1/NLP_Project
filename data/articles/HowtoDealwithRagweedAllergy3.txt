 Sneezing, runny noses, and stuffiness are some of the most common ragweed symptoms.If you’re experiencing any of these problems, you could try any number of over-the-counter decongestants to minimize these symptoms.Always consult your doctor before taking over-the-counter drugs for allergies. Exercise extra caution if you have high blood pressure, glaucoma, prostate problems, or a heart condition.
Side effects of decongestants include nervousness, elevated blood pressure, arrhythmia, and insomnia.
Men with an enlarged prostrate might have difficulty urinating when using decongestants.
Some over-the-counter drugs are not meant to be taken long term. Always read the label for the proper dosage information.
 A sore, itchy, or otherwise irritated throat often accompanies ragweed allergy.One way to deal with this is to get over-the-counter medicines like guaifenesin or a liquid cough syrup like Benylin, Delsym, or Robitussin. These liquid cough syrups suppress the urge to cough using the active ingredient dextromethorphan. Additionally, throat lozenges can help relieve your irritated throat.Lozenges are available in many flavors, including cherry, grape, and mint. Find one that you like.
 Look for eye drops that contain the ingredients tetrahydrozoline and naphazoline. These ingredients combat inflammation in the eye’s blood vessels. Brand-name versions of these drugs include Clear Eyes and Visine. There are also antihistamine eye drops like Zaditor and Alaway that suppress allergic reactions in your eyes, but these need to be applied with greater frequency than eye drops containing tetrahydrozoline and naphazoline.Specific use for eye drops typically requires leaning your head back, holding the eye drop bottle above your eye, then gently squeezing one drop into each eye at regular intervals.
Use eye drops only as directed.

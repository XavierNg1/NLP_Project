 Before adding ingredients, make sure your blender is unplugged. When the lid is firmly in place, blend the ingredients until they are creamy and well mixed throughout.


If you don't have a blender, you should be able to do this with a whisk as well, though it may take more time and some extra effort on your part., Choose a freezer safe container and pour your blended mixture into it. Keep the mixture in your freezer for about 4 to 6 hours, or until it has become firm.


To prevent some of the mixture from accidentally spilling in your freezer, you may want to cover it with a lid or plastic wrap.
For a quicker preparation time, you can use an ice cream maker. These generally freeze your ice cream in roughly 20 minutes., Depending on the temperature of your freezer and where you've placed the ice cream in it, the ice cream may have hardened too much. In this situation, set the ice cream out to thaw for 15 to 20 minutes before you serve it.

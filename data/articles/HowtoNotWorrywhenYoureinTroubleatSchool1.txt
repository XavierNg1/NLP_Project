 If you’ve done something small like forgetting your pencil in class or getting caught with a snack, you have little to worry about. Simply do as your teacher asks to fix the problem and then move on. There is no need to fixate on the problem and make yourself worried and distracted from the rest of the class.For example, you might tell yourself something like “Everyone makes mistakes. I’ll do better next time.”
Keep in mind that repeatedly doing small things might lead you to be in more trouble than if you just do it once. If you continue to worry, you’ll be distracted and more likely to get into trouble again.;
, You might feel like you can lie your way out of the situation, but that rarely works. You are far better off to own up to your actions and accept responsibility. This way, your teachers are more likely to think that you are taking the situation seriously and will respect you more.
 You may have gotten caught breaking a rule, and now your mind has gone straight to the worst possible scenario. Instead, think about anyone else in the school that has done something similar. Try to remember what their punishment was like, or if they had one at all. This will be a good indicator as to what kind of trouble you are in., Even if you get in trouble a time or two, your life isn’t over. Avoid the urge to create a doomsday scenario in your mind. You will still be able to graduate, have a good career, and lead a happy life.

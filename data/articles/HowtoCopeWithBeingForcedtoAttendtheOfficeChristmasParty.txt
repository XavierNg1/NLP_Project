 While you're obliged to turn up, you're not obliged to stay for the whole party. In fact, make it absolutely clear before going that you're really excited about the party but isn't a pity that you have to attend your child's Christmas pantomime show just two hours after the office party begins. This lets people know you're keen to go but family or other personal commitments will be cutting you short, thereby making you both work and family conscious.


If the party is during work hours, you'll need to square taking off early for personal reasons with your superior. Just disappearing during work hours can cause people to worry about you.;
, This is the season for caring about others and sharing. Share a little of yourself and be prepared to chit chat more than perhaps you would normally. Using the excuse that you'd rather die than spend social time with work colleagues isn't healthy for your career prospects anyway.
 They might quickly decide that you're being a bit of a snob and giving them the old heave-ho, which won't make things good for you back in the work environment.
 You don't have to spend the whole time hanging around being superficially polite to the harasser from floor four or the trophy wife from reception; after a few polite exchanges, simply sidle off and discover those colleagues you enjoy talking to.
 If there are too many sentimental work moments being relived by the more extroverted elements of the party or the party's just too loud/crass/crazy/boring, etc., hug the side of the room or even wander into the corridor or outside now and then. Grab a drink and some nibbles, a sympathetic colleague and huddle away somewhere near enough to be seen but not drawn into the center of the party.
 Be prepared to enjoy yourself and you might be surprised to find that you actually do. Free food, free booze, free entertainment; don't look the gift horse in the mouth.

 Most sales professionals who sell products through home booking parties promote their products on a website, which includes ordering information.


Include a space on your website that provides information on how to contact you to book a party. Be sure to describe the benefits that hosts enjoy.
 Facebook is a great way to promote your business and invite people to "like" you.


Advertise all of your parties and events on your page. Invite your followers to attend.

 Put it in a little nest. Don't keep it under a heat lamp all the time. If this dragon were in the wild, it's mom would have gone out to get things like food for herself before the eggs hatch. So, maybe if you use a lamp often, only put the nest under the lamp when you would normally use it.;
, Keep an eye on it when it starts to move. Always be there when the dragon hatches, because, like ducks and other birds, newly hatched dragons think that the first thing it sees is it's mom. And you would be pretty embarrassed if your dragon thought that your Superman poster was it's mom, right?

, Grab a bit of meat or fish. Put the meat at the bottom of your hand. (Closest to the elbow). If the dragon is hungry, it should A)Go around your hand and get it from there. B)Get scared and won't move. Or C)climb onto your hand to get it. Do this once a day and it should trust you in about a week. Now you should have a bond.
 Once you have the bond, you can start training it. When you have its attention, flap your arms like a bird. It should do the same. While still flapping, run and jump. It should do the same. Get your hands ready to catch it if it falls. It will probably keep trying. That is how to teach it how to fly.
 When it does something good, like flying well, give it a small dog treat or little bit of meat or fish. When it does something bad, which they rarely do, firmly say no.
 Build or get a little box. Get some face cloths, then get an oven mitt. Put the face cloths in, then the oven mitt. Your dragon will sleep inside the oven mitt because it feel just like its mother's breath.
 They will love you for it. They will help for the next step too!

, They take a deep breath. If they have enough chemicals in their lungs, then it can immediately blow out the breath weapon on its victims. The toys will be great practice targets.

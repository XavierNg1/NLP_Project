 One of the biggest indicators your opponent is bluffing is how your opponent bets. An opponent who normally raises pre-flop to five multiples of the blinds suddenly and makes it 2x the blind instead. This is a major tell that they want you to call. If they make it 10x the blind, they wants you to fold.Take note of how aggressive your opponent bets when they have a good hand. If they are generally a more aggressive better overall, thereâ€™s a chance that they will try to intimidate you out of your hand with strong betting patterns.
 When a quiet person at the game suddenly starts talking, it's time to pay attention. Introverted people often talk less because social interaction may stress them out. This means that if a quiet opponent is talking, they are likely relaxed.A relaxed opponent is likely not bluffing and may even have a strong hand.
On the other hand, if a more social player suddenly gets quiet, they may be devoting most of their attention to their hand. Chances are that they have something good and need to think about how to play it.
 This is a tell for a player holding a major hand. Often, players nervous enough to shake know that they are not in any condition to bluff. It would be too noticeable. Instead, this tell typically indicates newer players who have trouble holding in their emotions. Expect aces, sets, or other huge hands when someone bets with shaking hands.When you see shaking stop, that is a potential tell that your opponent is bluffing. This may be seen right after your opponent bets against you. Look for any signs that they are trying to control themselves.
For people who shake or bob their legs unconsciously, a bluff may cause them to stop their movement in an attempt to control themselves and make it appear as though they have no tells.

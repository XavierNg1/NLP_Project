 What was once the actual station has been refurbished into a pub.;
, There is a little laneway next to the pub with open gates leading out to the platform. Go up this lane and through the gates and wait on the platform.
 The driver will be able to see you clearly. Remember to keep well behind the indicated yellow line.
 The timetable is about hourly, a little more frequently during morning and evening rush hour. If you want to catch a train on the weekends, you will have to get a bus (or take a very long hike) to the nearest stations, Petone or Ava.
 It is very scenic as the train travels alongside the harbor.
 This is the end of the line, Wellington. If you're not sure, watch for the emptying of the train, conductor included. To come back home, do it all in reverse, and if needed you can ask for assistance at Wellington Station.

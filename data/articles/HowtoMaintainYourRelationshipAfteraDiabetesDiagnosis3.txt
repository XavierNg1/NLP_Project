 If you are in a relationship and you get diagnosed with diabetes, it’s important that your partner is informed about your diabetes. You should tell them whether you have type 1 or type 2, and then explain what that means for you.Your partner may be really scared or confused after your diagnosis. Don’t leave them in the dark. Encourage them to learn about your condition, treatment, and management.
 When you have diabetes, you may have blood-sugar related mood swings. You may feel irritable, weak, or confused. You may get upset easily or snap at your partner. Tell your partner that these mood swings may occur and to not take it personally if it happens.For example, you may go too long without eating, which makes you feel irritable. Because of this, you might get angry at your partner due to something that is a minor irritation.
You can say, “If I have a blood-sugar related mood swing, be patient until I eat something or level out. Know that I do not mean to be angry or snap at you if I do.”

, Sometimes, people in a relationship with a diabetic person start policing their habits. They watch and comment on all your food choices or stand over your with test strips and insulin.

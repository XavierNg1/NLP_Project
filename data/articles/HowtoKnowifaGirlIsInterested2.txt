 Pay attention to how the girl you’re interested in is physically acting. If she's open and receptive - and her body is going along with such a way of acting - chances are she's totally into you, or at least interested. The same can be said for a lack of body language.


Is she facing you during conversation? Does she nervously laugh at your jokes? Does she look you in the eye when talking? If she is during all of the above, she’s definitely opening up to you and fully engaged in your conversation. While this may not immediately mean she's into you, she's definitely interested in the conversation as well as who she's talking to..
Folded arms, crossed legs, and fidgety hands are a sure sign of negative body language. If she’s behaving in anxious ways, her mind is on something else. This does not mean, however, that she’s completely disinterested. You can always use this as an opportunity to ask more questions. Who knows, she may find your inquisitiveness comforting. , Eye contact is one of the most important forms of communication. It reveals respect, attention, understanding and interest. If she keeps your gaze and does not avert her attention, she’s probably interested. It also means she’s doing everything she can in order to learn more about you. , Note small quirks during interactions with the girl you like. If you tell a joke, pay attention to the manner in which she laughs and responds. If you ask a certain question, see if she hesitates or chooses to dive right in. These small "tells" often reveal a lot about a person’s interest level and overall personality.


Don't make mountains out of molehills. In other words, don’t look too far into a small quirk and misinterpret it. After all, people behave in a variety of ways for a variety of reasons. People often perceive people in a fast but flawed way before getting to know one another. Don't make the mistake of misjudging the girl you feel may be interested in you.

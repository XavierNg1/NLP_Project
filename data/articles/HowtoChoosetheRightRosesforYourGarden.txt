 How will the color of your roses affect your garden? Look at different catalogs, as well as your neighbors' gardens, to get an idea of the colors you like best.;
, In addition to color, the size of the roses you choose is very important. Consider the height of your roses at full-growth. If the roses grow fifteen feet in height, will they look unattractive in your garden? Remember, the size of roses vary. While some roses may grow up until eight feet, other can grow up to twenty feet in height.
 In order for your roses to grow healthy and mature, they have to be adjusted to your climate. For example, if you live in an area where it snows six months out of the year, you'll want to make sure you purchase roses that can withstand cold temperatures. If you have humid summers, choose roses that are resistant to diseases such as black spot and powdery mildew.
 How much time are you willing to spend maintaining your roses? Do you live to be in the garden, or are you more of a low-maintenance type? There are several types of roses which are very high-maintenance. Although they will look beautiful in your garden, they will require a lot of your time. The classifications known as hybrid teas and floribundas are very beautiful, long blooming, and highly fragrant; however, many of them are disease-prone. Older varieties, "landscape roses," and many others are easy and rewarding to grow.

 Select the location from which the weather balloon payload will be released. Select a location at least 90 miles (140 km) away from an airport and at least 250 miles (400 km) away from a lake or larger body of water.;
, Using the duct tape, tape the point at which the parachute strings meet to the handle of the payload container. Tape this area very well.
 Almost completely envelop the output valve of the tank with the neck of the weather balloon.
 Turn the knob on the tank to fill the weather balloon with helium. As the weather balloon is being filled with helium, continuously measure the weather balloon's shadow with the tape measure until the shadow has reached the specified diameter of the weather balloon. Then turn the knob on the tank in the opposite direction it was first turned, until it is a struggle to turn it any further.
 Pull the neck of the balloon completely off of the helium tank's outlet valve. Tie the neck with an overhand knot. Immediately after, have your friend hold the weather balloon. From this point, your friend will be holding the weather balloon until the project is released into the atmosphere.
 Tie this knot above where you just tied the neck of the weather balloon with itself. Cut a piece of string 8" long and use it to tie off the balloon.
 Cut a 10 foot (3 m) long string. Tie one end of the string to the handle of the payload container. Then tie the other end of the string to the neck of the balloon.
 If the shed you used to construct it is at the destination chosen to release the project, all that is left is for you and your friend to step outside of the shed and to release it! If the shed isn't at the destination that was selected, drive to the destination and release it there. Either way, have fun watching it ascend!

 If you really have a fly problem, put flypaper in your room to keep the flies away. Though it won't look pretty, it will definitely get the job done. Hang it in the sunshine and away from any wind for it to be most effective., Place fly traps outside your window or out in your yard to catch the pesky creatures. Don't install them in your room, though -- they can be quite smelly and the odor will quickly overwhelm your abode., The water in the bags will reflect light and will make the flies become disoriented and unable to enter your home., If you've noticed a spider or two in the corner of your room or hanging from the ceiling near your window, live and let live. As long as the spiders aren't dangerous, they will help kill flies and keep you and your room safe from these pesky creatures. The next time you see a spider in your room, ask yourself if you really need to kill it.
 If you see fly, you can use the swatter to put it out of its misery. Just position the head of the swatter over the fly and use your wrist to flick the swatter over the insect. Though it's not a good long-term solution, it'll work great if a fly approaches you, or if you see a fly coming into your room without being invited.

 You’ll get a lot of different opinions about this topic, but I feel that selling information as an upsell is by far and away your best bet.;
, If you sell cameras, make a report on how to take the best pictures or something similar to that.
 You can choose to offer it in print or digital form. Do remember that physical print formats have a higher perceived value. If you choose to create a printed report, you simply add it to the package that includes the other item they bought.
 That’s all you have to do. If your offer is good, many people will opt for the upgraded package. Be sure to show them why it’s in their best interest to go with the upgraded package.

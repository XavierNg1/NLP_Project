;
, Add the rest of the sugar and mix through.
 Dust the surface with cornflour and icing sugar. After rolling out, divide the fondant into eight even portions.
 Remove a small piece of the fondant for the ears. Roll the rest of the piece into a ball, then push it down to form a length (the mouse body). At one end shape a sharper point to create the nose and head shape. At the other end, keep the rounded ball shape - you will be attaching a ribbon tail here. Press in the two small confectionery balls to serve as eyes.
 Make two little rounded shapes with a hollowed middle part, just like real mouse ears. Use a toothpick to help shape and to make insertion holes in the head part of the mouse. Press in the ears and close the fondant around the ear base to hold in place.
 Cut a length of thin ribbon in to form the tail. Alternatively, use a length of licorice or other long candy piece. Or, as in the image above, use a stick for the tail.
 Put the eight mice onto the tray. Cover with another sheet of paper (wax paper is a good choice as it is slightly heavier and less inclined to blow off). Put the tray in a dry, warm place to dry the mice. Leave for 48 hours.
 The mice are now ready for sale.

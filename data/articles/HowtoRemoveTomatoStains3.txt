 Using a spatula or putty knife, wipe up any sauce or tomato residue that has been left behind. Make sure you use an item with a clean, straight edge to wipe, as wiping with cloth or a jagged edge could set the stain further., Dampen a clean white rag with cold water, and blot the stain, going over it several times until the stain has grown light in color.Using a colored rag could result in the transfer of color, so avoid colors or patterns.
 Apply a small drop of dish soap to the stain, and rub it in small circles using a brush or your finger. Be careful to only rub directly on the stain, as rubbing outside of the stain’s diameter could transfer the stain to a larger area.Some fabrics such as wool may react poorly to dish soap. Check your furniture’s cleaning instructions to avoid damaging the fabric.
 Blot the stain with a damp rag to remove soap bubbles. You can use a gentle wiping motion if the soap bubbles are stubborn, but be sure to wipe carefully and lightly, without putting any undue pressure on the fabric.


If your first blotting rag does not have a significant clean space, use a new rag. You don’t want to transfer the stain back onto your fabric.
 If the stain is still visible, repeat the process, applying a small amount of dish soap, rubbing it in, and removing the remaining soap with a damp rag.
 Once the stain has been lifted, blot the area dry using a clean, white towel. Place the towel directly over the area and apply firm pressure, repeating this process until the fabric is dry to the touch.


Avoid pouring water onto the furniture, as this could wet the pad beneath the fabric and result in mold or mildew. Stick to a damp rag for removal.

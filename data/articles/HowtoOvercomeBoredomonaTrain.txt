, Books are relaxing, and you can enjoy a nice story while traveling.
,, You can always stare at the snow, or view the sunset! But if you are prone to getting motion sickness, try to stay away from doing this for too long.
 Write what to do when you arrive, sketch something, or even write a letter.
 Eat some chips, or you can always enjoy that yummy sandwich you made back at home! Have some water, drink some soda. Don't eat too much as something to do, because you could get bloated or feel sick.
 Cover the window, and change into something more comfortable. If you don't have a private space, find a bathroom if there is one and change in there.
 It will help pass time.
 You can also go on a portable digital item such as a Nintendo DS or a DVD player. If your phone can entertain you with games and such, have it handy!

, Especially if you reach your destination in the morning!

, Go to the bathroom, wash your face, brush your teeth, change your clothes, comb your hair, spray yourself a little bit, and wait for the train to get to the station. Freshening up will give you something to do.
, Call the person who waits you at the train station, and inform him about the delay. If you're leaving and getting on trains alone, walk around the train station and the area around it. But don't go too far if you don't have much time; you wouldn't want to be late!

Make sure to be very gentle with the cards. Always stop bending when you feel resistance., Pro card dealers are able to quickly and impressively shuffle and cascade a deck. However, getting these motions down takes time. If you jump into fast motions, it's easy to make mistakes when shuffling. At first, do all the motions slowly and precisely. With time, you'll get the hang of shuffling your deck and you should be able to complete the cascade faster., It takes awhile to figure out what's comfortable for you in terms of shuffling your deck. Don't get discouraged if you fumble a bit at first. Give it time and practice each day. Eventually, you'll be cascading cards with ease.

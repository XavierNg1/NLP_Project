 Mix 1 tablespoon of meat tenderizer with 2 teaspoons of cold water in a small bowl to make a paste.Mix thoroughly until the paste is of uniform consistency.


Meat tenderizer is a great option for removing old blood stains. Meat tenderizer breaks down proteins found in blood, making it an effective blood removing agent., Use your fingers to gently spread the paste on the blood stain. You should rub the paste into the fabric with your fingers, but be sure to do this without applying too much pressure. Let it sit for 1 hour.
 With a dry cloth, you can brush off the excess paste, taking care not to spread or reapply the stain that has been pulled out and absorbed by the meat tenderizer.
 To clear off any remaining paste, take a cloth that you've wet with cold water, and lightly dab until you no longer bring up any paste or stain. Be sure you rinse thoroughly, any paste you leave behind may get rubbed into your upholstery and stain it again.
 Excess moisture should be lifted from the rinsed area using a dry towel applied to the area with blotting motions.

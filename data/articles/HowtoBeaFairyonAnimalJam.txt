 Usually when people imagine fairies, they imagine small, cute creatures with wings. On Animal Jam, the best animals for non-members are bunnies and koalas, while members should choose foxes, eagles or a toucan. However, there is no one specific kind of fairy that you should be - choose whatever animal you like best.;
, Simple fairy wings are easy to get for both members and nonmembers. There are varieties, but if there are other available options then feel free to get them!


For members, there are a few other versions of the fairy wings to choose from. In a few shops there are fairy wings to customize. But if you are a dark fairy, use the dragon wings.
 You can buy cute necklaces and hats that will make you look much more like a fairy. The lollipop necklace from the summer carnival is the best for fairies, but you can wear whatever accessories and other clothing you want.
 Which colors you should choose depends on what kind of fairy you are. If you are a water fairy, your best choice is probably a few different shades of blue. For fire fairies, choose red and orange, choose appropriate colors for other types of fairies. But remember, this all depends on what you like.


Since the latest Animal Jam update, there are tons of colors to choose from. Remember, you can change your colours whenever you like!

, Personalities on fairies drastically range from perky to fiery to sullen. Choose a personality that fits your fairy, and make sure to consider the type of fairy you are - a fire fairy is more likely to be quick-tempered and lively, whereas a water fairy might be calmer and just go with the flow.
 For instance, most fairies love to dance. Express this by dancing in many different areas, including Jamaa Township.

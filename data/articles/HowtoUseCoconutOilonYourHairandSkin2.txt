 Whether you lightly splash your face with water, exfoliate it with a brush, or use the oil cleansing method, go ahead and wash your face. Pat it dry with a soft towel, making sure not to pull at your skin - your facial skin is fragile, and a lot of pulling and tugging can cause damage.
 Coconut oil is a wonderful undereye cream. It helps moisturize that paper-thin skin, improving dark circles and keeping wrinkles at bay. Use your fingertip to pat—don’t rub—a tiny amount under your eyes, focusing on areas that have wrinkles. Then, gently run your finger along your undereye area to distribute the oil.You probably only need a pea-sized amount for each eye. Take care not to use too much.
Avoid getting the coconut oil in your eyes. It will thinly coat your eyes, making your vision blurry for a little while!

, If you tend to get a very dry patch between your eyebrows, at your temples, or in another spot, apply a small amount of coconut oil there. Rub it in gently using a circular motion.
 Unrefined coconut oil will soften and moisturize chapped lips. It's completely edible, so there's no need to worry about ingesting a little. In fact, eating coconut oil is great for your health.
 If you have dry skin, then you might consider applying coconut oil as a face cream. However, do not apply oil before applying makeup because it will affect the look of your makeup. Put it on after a shower or after washing your face. Let it absorb into your skin for 10 minutes before applying makeup. You only need about a dime-sized amount to cover your whole face.


Some people experience breakouts when they use coconut oil all over. Experiment by using coconut oil on just one patch of skin for a few days. If you like the effect and see no signs of the breakout, use it all over.
You can use coconut oil for the oil cleansing method, too. Again, be careful if your pores are prone to get clogged. You can cut coconut oil with castor oil if you're worried it will be too rich for your skin.

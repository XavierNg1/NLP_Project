 They can help you to defend your villages in clan wars. Dragons, wizards and valkyries are the best choices to donate.
 Scouting will help you to work on how will you attack and deploy your troops. It can also help what kind of defense strategy is your opposition applying.
 Previous attacks of yours can assist you to work on your mistakes. You can see trap locations and clan castle troops. Replays of others are also very watchful which can show others' attack strategies.
 Make sure everything is planned about how you and your clan mates will attack. For example, if your clan has 40 members, top 20 players will attack only top 20 players of your opposition clan and others will attack the rest.
 After you practiced attacking, you must have known what kind of troops are better for you. Use them in your clan war battles.
 Bases that are not attacked by any of your clan mates, try those first. You can at least get 1 star from that village.
 If you had destroyed a village in your first attack, try to find the same kind of base where you can easily win.

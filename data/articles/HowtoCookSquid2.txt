 Calamari requires thin rings of squid. If you start with the body of the squid, simply pat it dry and then cut horizontally across the body with a sharp knife -- turning the tube of seafood into 1/2" rings for cooking.


1 lb of fresh squid usually equals 1/2 lb of calamari, which is generally enough for one person.
 This will make a heavenly fried calamari, but you can skip the step if you don't have time. To make your own buttermilk mixture, if you don't have any handy:


Mix 2 cups of milk with the juice of one large lemon. You can also add a dash of hot sauce too for flavor.
Let the mixture sit for 4-5 minutes. You should see it thickening.
Soak the calamari rings in the buttermilk mixture for 3-4 hours before moving on. When ready, remove the rings and drain any excess liquid., You can also add any other spices you desire, such as a teaspoon of paprika, chili powder, or cayenne. Whisk together well.
 Coat the rings so that each of them is completely covered in flower. You may need to work in small batches, and you'll likely need to add more flour if you start running out.
 You may need 1-2 cups of vegetable oil in order to have enough, as it should almost coat the rings when they cook. If you have a thermometer, get the oil up to 360℉. You can also use a deep-fryer set to 360℉. If you don't have a thermometer, wait until the oil is shimmering throughout.
 Flip the rings once as they cook, removing them when the flesh underneath the breading is no longer shiny or translucent. Make sure you don't crowd the pan, adding only enough pieces to fill the bottom without touching or overlapping. Adding too much will drastically lower the temperature of the oil, leading to greasy, unappealing calamari.If you want crispier calamari with a smoother inside, heat the oil to 400℉ and cook the squid for no more than a minute or a minute and a half.

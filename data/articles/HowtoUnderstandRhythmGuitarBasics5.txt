 That low, chunky, plodding chord sound in many songs is done by palm muting. To do so, you place the meaty part of the right hand on the strings somewhat close to the guitar's bridge, holding it just on the strings so you can still hear them, but they still sound slightly dead.
 Keeping your palm lightly on the strings, pluck the low E string a few times. It should have a dull, chunky sort of sound. If you're right handed, your fingers go as far down the right of the guitar as possible.
 It's a good idea to use the bridge pickup on your electric guitar with this technique, providing more chunk.









Choose the neck pickup for a grinding, long, deadly buzzy sound for palm muting.
When possible, use a guitar with humbucker pickups for palm muting. Make sure your gain and volume are up so you can fill the song with a thick, rhythmic chunk.
 Getting your palm onto the guitar without missing a beat is a key skill for rhythm guitarists. You should be able to flip back and forth between the two -- going from strong, killer chords to a palm-muted bridge in an instant. The contrast between the two is a great rhythmic trick for any guitarist.









Learn to start palm muting, then slowly raising your palm off. Work on acting as a human volume knob, seamlessly transitioning.

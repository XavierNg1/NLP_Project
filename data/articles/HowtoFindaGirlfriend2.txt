 Many relationships happen because someone told his friends that heâ€™s looking for a relationship. Your friends might know someone who is single and looking, and they might help you make a connection.
 It has become much more common for people to connect with each other via online dating websites like e-Harmony and Match.com. Scope out these sites and join one. Fill out your profile and be open to getting to know other people.
 Your friends and family want to help you be happy. They might set you up on a blind date to meet a girl, which can be uncomfortable. Take a risk, though, by agreeing to the blind date. Think of it as an opportunity to meet someone new and interesting.

 You can use eBook-loading third-party software to load eBooks with file formats not supported by Nook. Calibre is one such application. It is a free eBook management program you can use to transfer and organize the eBooks on your reader.


Get Calibre by heading to http://calibre-ebook.com/; on the home page, click the blue "Download Calibre" button, and once the installer has finished downloading, double-click on the installer file to install it onto your computer.
 Once it’s installed, launch Calibre from your desktop, and click the “Add Books” button on the upper-left corner of the Calibre window to start adding eBooks to the Calibre library (similar to the iTunes library).
 After selecting the eBook files you want, click “Open,” and the eBooks you’ve selected will automatically be added to the Calibre library.
 To do so, get your Nook’s data cable, connect it to the micro USB port on your Nook, and plug the other end to a USB port on your computer.


Wait for Calibre to detect your Nook. You'll know that Calibre has detected Nook when you see the "Send to device" button on the menu bar.
 Afterwards, click the “Send to device” button on the menu bar. Calibre will begin copying, and once the process is done, the loading animation on the lower-right corner of the window will stop.


Once loading animation stops, you can disconnect your Nook from the computer, and start reading the eBooks.

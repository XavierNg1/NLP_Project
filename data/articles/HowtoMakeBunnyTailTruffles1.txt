 Add an 8-ounce (225 g) package of cream cheese that’s been softened to the bowl of a stand mixer. Insert the paddle attachment and beat the cream cheese on medium until it is light and fluffy, which should take approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute.You can soften the cream cheese by placing it in the microwave on a microwave-safe plate for 10 to 15 seconds.
You can use a handheld electric mixer to mix the truffles if you prefer.;
, Once the cream cheese is fluffy, add 4 to 5 cups (440 to 550 g) of powdered sugar to the bowl. Beat the sugar in 1 cup (110 g) at a time, though, and mix well after each addition until a thick dough forms.Powdered sugar is also known as confectioners’ sugar or icing sugar.
You’ll know the mixture has reached the right consistency if it holds its shape when you form it into a ball. If it is too loose, continue adding the sugar.
 When the mixture has formed a thick dough, use clean hands to roll it into balls. Aim for balls that are approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) large.You can adjust the size of the balls depending on how large you’d like the truffles to be.
 After you’ve formed balls from the dough, fill a shallow dish with 2 to 3 cups (150 to 225 g) of sweetened coconut. Roll the balls through the coconut to coat them, pressing the flakes onto the dough to help them stick. Arrange the truffles on a platter and serve.If you’re having trouble getting the coconut to stick to the truffles, you can coat the dough lightly with corn syrup before rolling them in the flakes.
Place any leftover truffles in an airtight container and store them in the refrigerator. They will keep for up to 4 days.

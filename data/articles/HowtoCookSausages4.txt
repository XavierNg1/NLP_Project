 While you wait for the oven to heat up, proceed to the next few steps.
 There are a lot of ways to cook sausages in the oven — the simplest is just to lay them directly on a metal baking pan. However, for even better results, try this method, which allows excess grease to drip away from the sausage like on a grill:


Line the pan with aluminum foil. This will make cleanup much easier.
Set metal baking racks over the foil-lined pan. The bars should be close enough to each other that sausages won't fall through.
 As with the methods above, the sausages should have an inch or so of space on either side so that they can cook evenly. If the sausage links are connected by their casing, cut them apart so that you can spread them out.
 Set the sausages into the center of the oven. Let them cook for 10 minutes before turning once, then let them cook the remaining 10 minutes undisturbed.Use a set of tongs to handle the hot sausages — they can sometimes grease unpredictably.
 When cooked in the oven, a "done" sausage looks roughly like one that's been cooked on the grill. The exterior should be brown and crisp all over. The inside should be moist and firm, with no pink remaining. Juices should run clear.


If the sausages don't appear done, continue to cook them in five-minute increments until they cook all the way through. Big, thick sausages can take lots of time to finish cooking.

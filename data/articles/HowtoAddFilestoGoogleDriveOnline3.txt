 You can download the app from your device's app store. Once downloaded, you'll be prompted to log in with your Google account when you start Drive for the first time. You may be logged in automatically if you use other Google apps on your device.
 If you have big files you need to upload, or you're uploading a lot of files, you'll likely want to connect to a wireless network so that you don't go over on your monthly data. It will also usually be faster than using cellular service for the upload.
 This will open a new menu.
 This will allow you to choose what you want to upload to Drive. Your upload options will be different on Android and iOS.
 The process for this is a bit different depending on whether you're using Android or iOS. This is due to the fact that iOS does not give access to the file system like Android does, so you're limited a lot more there.


Android - Browse the Upload menu to find the file you want to add to Drive. The menu on the left side of the screen allows you to choose different locations on your phone, such as images, videos, and downloads. You can also use the File Manager option at the bottom to browse all of the files and folders on your device.
- Select "Photos and Videos" or "iCloud Drive" to view these items. You can tap "More" to see what other apps can connect with Google Drive. If you select "Photos and Videos," you'll be prompted to allow Drive to access them, then you can select from any of the photos or videos on your camera roll.
 You can press and hold a file and then tap additional files to select more than one at a time. This will allow you to upload multiple files with one command.


You can simply tap a single file to begin uploading it immediately.
 The selected files will begin uploading to Google Drive. You'll be able to monitor the upload process in the Drive app.

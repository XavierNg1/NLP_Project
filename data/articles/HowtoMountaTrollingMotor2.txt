 The anti-cavitation is a horizontal plate above the propeller on either an outboard motor or the outboard unit of an inboard-outboard motor that keeps the propeller from breaking the water's surface as it pushes the boat forward. The mounting bracket is designed so that when the boat is "on plane" (the bow lifts out of the water as the boat skims across its surface), the trolling motor does break the water's surface.


Your anti-cavitation plate must run at a depth of at least 13 inches (32.5 cm) below the waterline, so that the trolling motor will run at least 6 inches (15 cm) below the waterline while in operation.
 Use the mount itself as a template for this.
 Use a drill bit sharp enough and tough enough to drill through the metal of the anti-cavitation plate.
, This will secure the trolling motor.


Engine-mounted trolling motors are designed only for V-hull or tri-hull boats that go "on plane." They are not designed for use with pontoon boats or with sailboats.

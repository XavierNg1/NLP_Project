 Write what you are feeling, hoping for them in the future, about your feelings of excitement.;
, Let them know what was going on that day. What events were taking place while you were awaiting their arrival. You can include topics about the weather that day, the economic status of the present time, who was president, your religious views, your feelings about seeing them for the very first time and anything else that you feel in your heart that day.
 Save a newspaper from that day. Save the balloons and cards that were given to you the day of your child's birth. Take some of the flowers that were delivered to you and have them pressed and dried. Be sure to hold onto your baby's first outfit they wore home from the hospital. Gather any other items that you think might be special from their day of birth together and keep in a box along with the two letters you have each written.
 Your baby's first pair of shoes, a favorite toy or stuffed animal. A special photo or two. Perhaps a blanket, night light, music box. Gather these together and add to your keepsake box.
 If you are able to, try to write several more letters noting your baby's first steps, first favorite foods, first words, and any other milestones that you think are special and a treasure to you. Write how it made you feel. Make sure to personalize the letter in a way that you are writing "to your child" instead of just noting information. Gather these together and add to your keepsake box.
 On their 18th birthday, pull out your keepsake box and give to your "baby". It is such a self-rewarding and meaningful treasure to watch the joy in their eyes as they read your letters and see the love gifts packed away from days ago. The time is but a blink of an eye.

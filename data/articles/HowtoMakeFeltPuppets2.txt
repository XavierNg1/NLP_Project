 Draw a rectangle onto cardboard to use as a template. Make the rectangle wider than the finger and about 2.5cm/1 inch longer than the finger. At one end of the rectangle, round it off––this becomes the top or head section of the finger puppet.
 Take care to round it off neatly. This is now the basic template for placing on the felt fabric.
 Each two pieces of felt forms one finger puppet, both head and body in one.
 Leave the straight end of the rectangle unsewn; this is the entry for the finger.
 This is the fun part but you do need to know what you want to turn the finger puppet into, such as a person or animal, and then decide what sorts of features, clothing, fur, hair, etc. the finger puppet will have.


Use yarn for hair and fur.
Use googly eyes or felt shapes for eyes.
Use felt shapes or fabric markers to make facial features such as a smile, nose, teeth, etc.
Make clothing using different colors of felt, fabric scraps, lace, ribbon, fabric paint (three-dimensional paint is a good choice), etc.

 Any time you work with acids, it is important to wear a lab coat or lab apron. Be sure that the sleeves cover your wrists and that it is buttoned all the way up. You will also want to make sure you meet certain safety requirements with what you wear in general. For example, you should wear closed toe shoes, long pants, and keep your hair pulled back.;
, It is also crucial for you to protect your eyes when working with acids. Use a pair of a large safety goggles that cover your eyes, both in the front and on both sides. Safety goggles often come in multiple sizes, and sometimes have an adjustable strap in the back. Be sure to select goggles that fit properly, and/or make adjustments for a snug fit.
 In order to properly handle acids, you will also need protective covering on your hands. Wear a pair of gloves, made from an acid-resistant material, such as nitrile or butyl.
 Your lab should be equipped with emergency showers, emergency eyewash stations, and at least one lab spill kit. Familiarize yourself with the locations of these stations and kits before you begin your work with acids.


If your lab does not contain these stations or kits, discontinue your work in that space, as it is not safe for handling acids.
 When a chemical or acid spill occurs, you must act quickly without panicking. You will be better able to accomplish this task if you are well educated on what to do.

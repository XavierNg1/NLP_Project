 The height of the pillars should be roughly the height that you want your fireplace to be. Since the wooden squares will be placed at the ends of the pillars, they should be slightly wider than them.
 Just make sure the mantelpiece is slightly wider than the width of your wooden squares.
 You may want to paint the wood to match the pillars (which are usually white) or paint everything a different color.
 You may need to use screws, nails, glue, or some combination thereof. (Donâ€™t worry about keeping the tops and bottom of the wooden squares looking nice; these will be hidden.) Your pillars should now have a finished look.
 Again, you can screw, glue, or nail these, but be careful to keep your attachments inconspicuous. For example, if the squares at the tops of the pillars have enough corner area sticking out, you might nail a few well-placed finishing nails from these overhanging corners upwards into your mantle.
 Either use a piece of wood similar in size and shape to your mantelpiece and paint it or find an appropriately-sized coffee table, cut off the legs, paint it to match, and place it beneath the fireplace.

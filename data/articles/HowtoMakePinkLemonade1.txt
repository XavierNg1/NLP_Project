 Stir 1 cup (240 mL) white sugar into 4½ cups (1125 mL) water until it dissolves. If you are using granulated sugar instead of superfine sugar, you might need to warm the mixture up slightly on the stove to help it dissolve.


If you like your lemonade sour, use ⅔ cup (160 mL) sugar instead.;
, In a jug that can hold at least 2½ quarts (2½ liters), mix the water and sugar mixture into 1½ cups (375 mL) lemon juice and 2 cups (500 mL) cranberry juice or other red fruit juice.


If you like your lemonade sweet, use 1 cup (240 mL) lemon juice instead.
If you do not have red fruit juice, you can replace it with water. The fruit alone will only add a little color, so add a couple drops of red food coloring as well.
 Strawberries can be cut into thin slices or chunks and added directly to the pitcher. If using raspberries, mash them in a separate bowl first to release the juice, then strain it over the lemonade through cheesecloth, muslin, or a fine mesh strainer.


You can skip this if you added red fruit juice, but the fruit will add additional flavor and a fresh appearance.
Let frozen fruit thaw for a few minutes first.
Raspberries add much more color than strawberries. Frozen raspberries add more than fresh raspberries, since the ice crystals rupture the fruit.
 Keep the pitcher in the fridge until ready to serve. Optionally, garnish the pitcher with thin slices of lemon and a few mint leaves.

 A hat with a wide brim 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) wide will keep the sun out of your baby’s eyes and off their face. Many newborn baby hats come with a strap that attaches under the chin, which can help keep the hat on your baby’s head.


Keep an eye on the strap as your baby moves to make sure it isn’t too tight or cutting off circulation.
 These UV-protected clothes can be a little pricy, but they are great if you will be spending long periods of time outside. You can buy shirts, bathing suits, hats, and rash guards for your baby with this protection., Pick out a pair that covers your baby’s eyes entirely. Make sure that they protect from UV rays. Look for a sticker that says UV400.


While your baby might not want to wear sunglasses, letting them pick out the sunglasses (if they are capable) may help convince them to wear the glasses. However, if your baby outright refuses to do this, don’t force them.
 While clothing will offer some protection against the sun, you should still keep your baby in a shaded area. Avoid direct sunlight as much as possible to protect them from both the heat and the sun.Babies younger than six months old shouldn’t wear sunscreen. If you can’t avoid direct sunlight, however, a very light coat of baby sunscreen is acceptable.
You can buy sunshades for strollers and prams if yours doesn’t already have one.
 If your child is dehydrated or overheated, visit a doctor immediately. Watch for the following symptoms:Dry lips and coated-looking tongue and mouth
Skin that is red or hot to the touch
A sunken fontanelle, which is the soft spot on the top of your baby's head
Urinating less than usual
Sunken and dark eyes
Irritable and tearless crying

Cold or blotchy hands and feet

 More creative children may want to draw pictures, others may want stickers or to write in colourful pens. This is their journal, so let them pick what they want and let creativity reign. Materials you may need are: Pens, pencils, a notebook/paper, glue stick (for pictures, menus etc), coloured pencils, stickers/other design products.


Children don't need leather bound books for their journals. A simple notebook or pages you design should work perfectly. If you choose to go the paper route, make sure to bring a folder for the pages so you can keep them all together and they don't get bent.
For on the go without a big bag, get a small notebook for bullet points of things you want to remember and a pen. This way you'll never forget anything and be able to fill it in all later without the hassle of pulling out a big notebook and taking time to write it out.;
, Later they can decide if they want to write about it all or only certain points. It's also important to remind your child about the journal as they may get excited and forget, even if they regret it later. Have a scheduled time for your child to do the journal each night. It will become a routine and you will not get it piled up. It will also be fresh in the mind so they'll remember more details.
 The entries don't have to be long if your child doesn't want them to be. Recording feelings/weather etc is also fun to add for later on. It doesn't have to be anything fancy.

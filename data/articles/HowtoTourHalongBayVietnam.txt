 Go to Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, and choose the transportation type.

The best way to go to Halong Bay from Hanoi is by bus. It is cheap and comfortable and the buses to Halong Bay are new, have air conditioning and come with a safe driver. The road quality from Hanoi to Halong Bay is acceptable, not too bumpy.

Decide on a tourist or local bus. A tourist bus is strongly recommended because it will be a new bus in good condition. It will take you directly from Hanoi to Halong Bay without any stops. However, you need to stay in Old Quarter.
Know how much a bus trip costs. Minh Sinh Travel company (the owner of Halong Galaxy Cruise) charges 8USD each way (170.000 Vietnamdong) or 15USD for a round trip (315.000vnd). If you book a tour with them directly, the cost of traveling by bus is included in the price. The staff of this company speak English.
In total, the drive from Hanoi to Halong Bay will take four hours. Taking a local bus is cheaper, but the bus is old and shocking, and there are indecorous staff. The staff will stop everywhere on the road to pick up more guests. If in some occasions of holiday in Vietnam, you will be stuffed. Mostly local people choose local buses because of the price; it costs about 4-6USD per way.
Another transportation you should consider is to go by seaplane. This trip only takes you 45 minutes to get to Halong Bay. The flight can be extended to include an additional 15-minute scenic tour over the bay, which allows you to enjoy a birdâ€™s eye view of the thousands of limestone karsts jutting up from the jade green waters and see remote fishing villages before landing at Tuan Chau Island Marina. However, the price is much higher from traveling by bus, about 300USD per person.

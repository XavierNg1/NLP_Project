 Make a complete circle around the pomegranate from the crown using a sharp knife over a sink or large pot of water. There is no need to cut too deeply as the juice will squirt or run out from the broken arils and possibly stain cutting boards and clothes.;
, You can do this over a sink in running cool water into a strainer or in a pot that is half filled with water to keep the seeds from bursting and leaking or splattering juices.
 Either under running water or pan of water separate the arils from the white membrane and outer skin with fingers. The white membrane will float and the seeds will remain at the bottom of the pan or strainer.
 Rinse to remove any remaining bits of membrane from the arils, strain and place in a bowl. The arils are now ready for eating, cooking, salads, or juicing. They are best used within 24 hours of peeling, but can still be enjoyed for a few days if covered and placed in the refrigerator.

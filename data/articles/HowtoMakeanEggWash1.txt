 If you are not interested in achieving a particular look, you can use any of the three you have on hand. Keep in mind it is the yolk of the egg that determines the shade and the gloss. The other liquids (including the egg white) are used to thin the yolk so it won't dry out your pastry and cause it to crack in the oven, and also to help you control the shine and shade of brown of your finished pastry.Water will make a less shiny (more of a matte), golden brown glaze. Adding water will make your wash extra flexible, and is good for things like bread that will expand a lot as they bake.Milk will add more shine, but otherwise will have a very similar affect as water.Cream will give your pastry a shiny, rich brown finish. It doesn't add as much give, so try to use it only on things that won't expand very much as they bake, like pie crust.;
,, Make sure the yolk is broken up and thoroughly mixed with the white.









Don't beat the egg too vigorously--you don't want the eggs to to become foamy., Start with 1 teaspoon per egg used.









If you are glazing something that is going to expand quite a bit (like a pastry or loaf of bread that is going to rise significantly), mix in another 1-2 teaspoons of liquid. This will give your glaze a little more give and prevent cracking as the pastry expands.,









If you are glazing something in a pan, like pie or bread, try not to let the egg wash spill over or drip down between the crust and the pan. This could cause your pie or bread to stick to the pan and could damage your finished product when you de-pan it later., If you have leftover egg wash that is not contaminated with raw meat or fish, you can cover the bowl and store it to make breakfast the next day.

 You want your drive-by traffic to know who you are and what your business does.;
, Be it a sale, an anniversary, or an open house, celebrate by promoting an event and opening your doors to the general public.



Run a time-sensitive sale or special to drive in traffic.
Offer a referral incentive for those who refer new customers your way.
, Both of these tools can be low cost and offer you means to keep your name in front of the crowd electronically.
 Radio works wonderfully for event-driven exposure, and television can help you build brand recognition.

Start with quality customer service. Be polite and respectful to everyone who comes in your door, and treat that person as you would want to be treated.
Train your staff not only how to be polite but how to successfully do their jobs as well. Being nice doesn't sell your product, nor does it help your staff avoid mistakes. Instead, that comes with good training and practice.
 You can do this in the store or on your website.


Institute a best practices methodology that includes not selling or sharing the customers' information with anyone outside of your business. Make sure that this policy is shared on your website for full transparency.
Follow up with emails to join your Facebook page, send a copy of an online newsletter or send emails about upcoming sales or special events. You want to keep your clients engaged in what is going on at your business, but on the other side be sure not to inundate them.
Mail out fliers, hard copy coupons or newsletters if the printing and mailing costs are affordable for you.
Always include an opt-out option so that customers don't feel like they are stuck getting your correspondence if they don't really want to.

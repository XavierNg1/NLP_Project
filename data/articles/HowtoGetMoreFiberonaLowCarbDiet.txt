 One of the food groups that isn't limited on most low-carb diets is the vegetable group. These foods are naturally low in carbohydrates and calories but high in fiber.


To make sure you can get the most fiber from the vegetable, the first thing you'll need to do is make sure you're eating enough vegetables daily.
Include at least three to five servings of vegetables each day. Measure out 1 cup or about 2 cups of leafy greens per serving.When you're planning your meals or snacks, always include a vegetable to help ensure you're getting a dose of fiber at every meal.
Although all vegetables are good for you, focus on the highest fiber vegetables like: artichokes, peas, broccoli, cauliflower, turnip greens, brussels sprouts, carrots and avocados.;
, In addition to vegetables, fruits are another food group that are naturally higher in fiber as well. Be mindful to choose foods that are high-fiber and lower in carbs.


Although fruit may be limited in your low-carb diet, most diets do allow for some fruit. Fortunately, many of the fruits that are a little bit lower in sugar and carbohydrates are the ones that are also higher in fiber.
To keep your overall carbohydrate intake in check when you're consuming fruit, measure your portions. One serving of fruit is 1/2 cup of chopped fruit or about one small piece.The highest fiber and lowest carb fruit includes: blackberries, raspberries, unsweetened coconut, pears and apples., Fiber isn't only found in fruits and vegetables. A subset of the protein group, nuts and seeds are the perfect fiber filled foods to eat on a low-carb diet.


Both nuts and seeds are naturally low in carbohydrates, but high in healthy fats and protein. Many nuts and seeds also have a high-fiber content as well.For instance, 1 ounce of almonds contains about 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of total carbs, and 3 grams of dietary fiber.
Like all other foods, measure the portions of your nuts and seeds. In general, about 1/2 ounce or 1 tablespoon is a serving of nuts or seeds.
The highest fiber nuts and seeds include: chia seeds, flaxseeds, almonds, pistachios, pecans and sesame seeds., Not all grains are overly high in carbohydrates. In fact, there are a few sneaky ways you can eat some grains or parts of grains to help boost the fiber in your diet without overdoing it on carbs.


Although a big hunk of bread or bowl of pasta will be overly high in carbohydrates, there are some grain-based foods you can enjoy that can help boost your fiber. Many low-carb versions of your favorite (like low-carb tortillas) and foods like wheat bran can help boost your fiber intake.
Try some high-fiber cereals and grains like: wheat bran; low-carb, high-fiber cereals; rice bran or oat bran. These foods are lower in carbs, but contain a lot of fiber. For example, wheat bran has 3 grams of carb and 6 g of fiber per 1/2 cup.Also consider purchasing and using low-carb versions of your favorite grains. There are low-carb breads, tortillas and wraps, pastas and English muffins. In fact, many of these also contain added fiber as well.
Like all foods, to keep the total carbs in control, always measure your portion sizes. Grains should be eaten in 1/2 cup or 1 oz servings., If you're following a low-carb diet, you may already have a system in mind for how you plan your meals. However, to make sure you're eating enough fiber, it's important to come up with a detailed meal plan.


It's easy to just cut out obvious sources of carbohydrates in your diet. It's a little more complicated to cut out carbs while still meeting your daily fiber needs. A meal plan can help provide a blueprint of exactly what you can eat to meet your carb and fiber needs.Pick a day during the week where you can sit down and come up with all the foods and meals you will eat over the next week. Write down each breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack that you will plan on eating.
After you complete your meal plan, you can make up your grocery list which will make it easier to get exactly what you need at the store.
 After you've created your meal plan, take a few minutes to see if the meals and snacks you have planned will meet your fiber needs. If not, make some changes to your meal plans.


To calculate how much fiber each day of meals and snacks provides, you may need to use an online food diary app, a smartphone app or just a search engine to find the fiber content of the foods you're planning on eating.
Add up all the fiber from your breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks and see if they meet your needs. Men need about 38 g of fiber daily and women typically need about 25 g of fiber per day.If you've met your fiber goal, then you can leave your meal plan alone; however, if you're far off from your goal, rework your meal plan or recipe ingredients to to help increase your fiber intake.
 Focusing on high-fiber foods can make meeting fiber needs a little easier. However, you may not enjoy foods that are higher in fiber or might be getting a little bored with the same foods. To mix it up, try adding extra fiber to your current favorite meals and recipes.


To help increase your fiber intake a little more, get creative in the kitchen and add fiber to your usual meals.
For example, you can blend dark greens or avocado into a morning protein shake or smoothie.
You can also sprinkle wheat or oat bran onto salads, added to foods like meatballs or meatloaf or even sprinkle it onto your morning yogurt or cottage cheese.
Blend vegetables into baked goods like meatballs, meatloaf, burgers or casseroles. Also add extra vegetables into some of your other favorite meals like adding steamed broccoli to a salad., Whenever you're following a diet it's a good idea to keep your doctor up to speed. This is especially true if you feel like you need to increase your fiber intake and are looking for ways to increase your fiber. Because some supplements can interfere with other medications or conditions, it's important to always consult your doctor before taking a supplement.


Talk to your doctor about your low-carb diet you're following. Share with your physician what foods are allowed and what foods you're avoiding.
If you have been keeping track of your fiber intake, share this information with your doctor as well. You may think you need more, but your doctor may think you're getting an adequate amount in.
If you're having a lot of difficulty meeting your fiber intake, ask your doctor if they have suggestions for you. Also talk to them about whether or not they think a fiber supplement would be safe or effective for you.
A dietitian is a health professional who is an expert on nutrition and diet. They can make sure you are getting adequate nutrients on your diet and help you figure out how to get more fiber. They can even help you create a meal plan to make sure you get all of your daily nutrients.
 The best source of additional fiber in your diet is from foods; however, it' may not be realistic to be able to rely solely on your diet everyday to meet your fiber needs.


One type of fiber supplement is a powdered supplement. There are a variety of these on the market and they are very easy and convenient to use.
In general, most powdered fiber supplements just require you to mix it into a liquid. Some have a flavor, like orange, and others are flavorless and can be added to anything (even foods like yogurt or soups).Follow the dosing instructions and portion sizes of the powdered supplements. You want to make sure that you're adding the right amount every day.
 If you don't think a powdered supplement would work well with your lifestyle, there are other options. You can take a fiber capsule or gummy each day to increase your overall intake.


Like the powdered supplements, fiber capsules will come with a recommended serving to take each day. Follow these instructions.Fiber capsules are easy to include in your diet. Take them along with your other medications or vitamins daily to help get you into the routine.
Other than your preference, there's no benefit of using the powdered supplements versus the fiber capsules.
 Whenever you're focusing on increasing your fiber intake, you also need to focus on your water intake as well. Fiber needs water in order to be effective in your diet.In general, as you increase your fiber intake, it's important to increase your water intake. There is not a recommended ratio, but aiming for the minimum recommended amount of fluids daily is a good place to start.
When you combine extra fiber and water together, it helps the fiber work more effectively. Fiber will absorb the extra water and make your stool softer and easier to pass.
It's typically recommended to consume about eight glasses of water daily; however, some people need closer to 13 based on their activity levels.If you're already consuming about eight glasses of water daily, increase to nine or 10 glasses per day as you increase your fiber intake.

 Slowing your speech so others can “understand” you better makes the listener feel inferior since it is the way an adult speaks to a child. When you are explaining something to someone, don’t assume that they are the problem. It is more likely that you are not explaining it clearly or correctly.For example, don’t say, “I. will. be. studying. the. way. humans. interact. in. groups.” Instead, speak normally by saying, “I will be studying the way humans interact in groups. Let me explain what I mean by interact.”

, Referring to yourself in third person gives you an air of superiority. It is something that you should avoid doing if you do not want seem condescending.For example, don’t say, “She won a prestigious award for her paper” if you are referring to yourself.
Also, try not to emphasize the my’s and I’s in your speech, for example, “MY opinion, is that MY book is the better book.”

, While conversing with others, always keep your head and chin level. If you point your chin up with your forehead back while looking down your nose, you will seem superior. This head position signals that you think you know more than the other person, and that your opinion is more important and valid.Also, try to avoid impatient body language, such as loud sighs, eye-rolling, constantly looking at your watch or your phone, drumming your fingers, and yawning.

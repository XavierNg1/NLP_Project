 Experts recommend a water and stain protector formulated specifically for suede. Water can be damaging to suede and eventually change the color and texture, but a protective spray will prevent this from happening. This can be purchased online through Amazon or from a big box store like Target or WalMart., Before using the spray, ensure that the boot is clean. An optimal time to do this is right after purchasing or receiving the boots, before even wearing them once. This way, you will be prepared for the elements and do not have to worry about cleaning them beforehand.
 Hold the spray bottle about six to eight inches away from the surface of the boot. It should come out of the bottle as a mist. Spray the boot all over with the protective spray, ensuring that you cover the entire surface of the boot. You only need to lightly spray the boot; too much could affect the boot’s texture or color.
 The protective spray should prevent the boots from becoming ruined by water or snow. However, on days when it is especially rainy, it is best to avoid wearing the boots altogether. If they do get wet, let them dry naturally, away from any sources of heat. When they are dry, brush them well with a suede brush., Purchase a special suede brush to use to brush out the nap, otherwise known as the surface of the suede. This will buff out any minor scuffs and help the shoes retain their soft, pleasant texture. Suede brushes are relatively inexpensive so it may be in your best interest to purchase one in order to keep your shoes looking their best.Suede brushes are available at stores like Target or department stores like Macy’s.
Before brushing the shoes, stuff them with crumpled newspapers. This will help the shoe retain its shape.
Gently brush the nap in the direction of the fibers. You can tell which direction the fibers are going in if you run your fingers or hands along the surface and see which way the fibers lay the flattest. Once this is established, brush in that direction.

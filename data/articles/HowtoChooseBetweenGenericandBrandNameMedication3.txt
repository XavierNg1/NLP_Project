 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration maintains a catalog of FDA-approved drug products and drug labeling called Drugs@FDA. You can search by drug name or active ingredient to find out if a generic equivalent exists for the drug your doctor prescribed., When your doctor prescribes a drug, it may or may not be covered by your insurance plan. Sometimes the insurance plan will only cover the brand name drug, while other times your insurance will instead cover the generic. Call your insurance provider and ask specific questions about which drugs are, or are not, covered by your individual insurance plan.
 Your health care provider will be able to help you decide if a generic or brand name medication is the best choice for you. This will depend on your budget, your insurance coverage, your medical needs, and your allergies. Together, you and your doctor can make a decision that is right for you.

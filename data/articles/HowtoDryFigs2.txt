 It's necessary to dry the figs at a low, even temperature. Drying them at a higher temperature would result in cooked figs.


If your oven doesn't heat to such a low temperature, set it at the lowest possible temperature and keep the oven door partially open.
You may also use a food dehydrator to dry figs.
 Carefully trim away any damaged parts and pat them dry with a paper towel or dishcloth.
 Use a sharp paring knife to slice them from stem to tip, lengthwise.
 Be sure to use a rack with ventilation holes, so that the figs dry from below and above. Using a regular baking pan will result in figs that don't dry evenly.
 Prop the oven door open slightly to allow the moisture to escape and prevent the figs from getting too hot and cooking instead of drying.


Turn the figs occasionally during the drying process.
If you don't want to leave the oven on continuously, you can turn it off halfway through, then turn it back on if necessary.
 The figs are dry when the outsides are leathery and no juice can be seen on the inside when you split one open. Store your dried figs in air-tight containers or freezer bags and keep them in the refrigerator or the freezer. Dried figs will keep for approximately 18 to 24 months when properly stored.

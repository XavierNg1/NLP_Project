 In many places, it's illegal to remove bird eggs from their natural habitat. In the U.S., for example, according to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, it is illegal to take or possess any part, nest, or egg of a wild bird species. You could receive up to six months of jail time and a fine of up to $15,000., If you come across a wild bird egg and see a nest nearby that’s empty or contains similar looking eggs, you could try to return the egg to its nest. If you do not see a nest, do not go looking for one, and never assume that an egg is abandoned.


Some birds nest on the ground. The Killdeer, for instance, prefers to nest on gravel!Never take an egg from a nest.
 Wildlife rehabilitators are licensed to care for injured or orphaned wild animals. If you find wild bird eggs and suspect that something’s wrong, contact your local wildlife agency or search online for a licensed rehabilitator.


Do not take the egg(s) to a rehabilitator. Instead, be prepared to direct the rehabilitator to the egg(s).
Be aware that a rehabilitator may only be interested in the egg(s) of endangered species.

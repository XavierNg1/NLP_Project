 Think of it as the reverse of a typical schedule. You don’t want to take a nap at 6:00pm if you’re going to bed at 10:00pm because it will probably make it hard to sleep at bedtime. The same rule applies here. Generally, right before work and on break (if you’re working at night) are perfect times to catch up on any of the sleep you’re lacking., Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day will help you quickly adjust to your daytime sleeping schedule. Since it goes against your natural biological clock to sleep during the day and be up at night, this is a very important part of making the change easy on your body., Whether it’s work or other obligations that have you up all night, if you can be up just a couple nights at a time followed by a couple nights of sleep you will undoubtedly be able to recover more quickly and easily.
 Getting into sunlight will help your body wake up faster and triggers your natural circadian rhythm so that it thinks it’s early in the morning when really it’s probably late afternoon.

 Stand up with your legs and back straight and your hands at your sides.;
, Crouch down onto your knees.
 Roll backwards, onto your back

, Put your hands just below your hips to hold your legs up into the air. (Like a back stand.)

, Let your legs fall backwards to your side.
 Use your arms to help you sit back up.


Congratulations! You've finished!

 The ideal temperature for older books is below tween 65 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 22 degrees Celsius).The ideal humidity level is around 35%.Conditions that are too dry can cause your old, rare books to become brittle, but excessive moisture could lead to mold or foxing (the specks, splotches, and other forms of discoloration that often afflict old books).
 Ultraviolet light fades the inks and dyes used in many books, especially in older works. Exposing a rare antique book to constant sunlight will cause considerable discoloration within a few short days., Place your old, rare books in unsealed acid-free polyethylene bags.Invest in a bookshelf with a glass door to further protect them from dust., Remove a fragile book from the bookshelf by tilting it backwards and easing it out of place from the front or top sides of the book. Do not remove the book from the top of its spine, since this is the most fragile part of any book. Ease the book open rather than forcing it, since force will likely cause stiff pages to come unbound., Even old, rare books can be stored on bookshelves and actually do well when stored this way as long as the humidity, temperature, and light conditions of the room are managed well. Keeping the books in a vertical position not only saves space but ensures that each book does not have to support the weight of any other book., The weight of large, heavy books put pressure on the spine, causing pages to slowly pull away. Avoid stacking too many of these larger, heavy books on top of one another, though, since stacking more than two or three such books puts too much pressure on the bottom book., The books should be packed securely enough to prevent them from tumbling over, but not so tightly that they are difficult to remove. Leaving a small gap between books both allows you to remove them with ease when you wish to and allows for greater air circulation between the books. This will prevent unnecessary friction or stress caused by squeezing one book against another.

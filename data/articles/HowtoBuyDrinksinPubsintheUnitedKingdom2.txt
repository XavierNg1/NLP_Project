 Brits always buy drinks in rounds. Even if they’re with people they don’t know, they will buy drinks in rounds. This system, whilst clearly open to abuse, has worked for several hundred years due to a tacit agreement by the entire population concerning certain rules. If drinking with Brits, you must adhere to these rules.
 Even if there is not a chance of you having another one that night, you shouldn’t feel guilty about not being able to get a round in. On most evenings, someone will end up slightly out of pocket. Perhaps you’ll be with the same people drinking every night; perhaps the guy who just bought two rounds in a row will be someone you never see again. The assumption is that over a lifetime these will balance out such that nobody really ends up out of pocket. Don’t feel bad about accepting drinks from strangers, and don’t feel bad about buying them.
 The only valid reason anyone may opt out of buying rounds is if they’re driving. Even then, they may be required to nominally take part in the system with an unwritten agreement that their round won’t come up as often as anyone else’s. If you’re intending only having one drink for reasons other than driving then you must still buy rounds for everyone else. This is your penalty for not drinking.
 Even if you can find a willing co-conspirator, this sort of behaviour is regarded as being out of order. No matter how rich you are, an important part of buying a round involves trying to remember the drinks everyone wanted, squeezing your way to the bar, shouting vainly at the barman, collecting your dripping-wet change, trying to squeeze in between the barflies to collect your drinks and then attempting to carry six beers back to the table via some ferrying system without crashing into anyone or spilling them.

 21 Dares is a fun party game to play with a large group of acquaintances or a small group of close friends. When all of your friends are ready to play, sit a in circle. Choose a person to start the game.


If there aren’t any volunteers or everyone wants to start, roll a die or pull straws to determine who will start counting first.;
, Throughout a round of 21 Dares, players take turns counting one, two, or three numbers in sequence to 21. The goal is to avoid saying “21”—whoever is forced to say “21,” has to complete a dare. You can choose the numbers that you say—there are no set patterns that your must follow. Examples of this counting process include:


Player A: “1, 2.” Player B: “3, 4, 5.” Player C: “6.” Player D: “7, 8, 9.” Player A: “10.” Player B: “11, 12, 13.” Player C: “14, 15, 16.” Player D: “17, 18, 19.” Player A: “20.” Player B: “21.” In this instance, Player B was forced to say “21.”
Player A: “1, 2, 3.” Player B: “4, 5.” Player C: “6, 7, 8.” Player D: “9, 10.” Player A: “11.” Player B: “12.” Player C: “13, 14, 15.” Player D: “16.” Player A: “17, 18.” Player B: “19, 20.” Player C: “21.” In this instance, Player C was forced to say “21.”
Player A: “1, 2, 3.” Player B: “4.” Player C: “5, 6.” Player D: “7, 8, 9.” Player E: “10, 11.” Player F: “12.” Player A: “13.” Player B: “14, 15, 16.” Player C: “17.” Player D: “18.” Player E: “19.” Player F: “20.” Player A: “21.” In this instance, Player A was forced to say “21.”, If this player refuses to accept the dare, they are out of the game. Every dare should be safe, fun, and harmless. If you accept and complete the dare, you will remain in the game. You and your friends can come up with dares in a variety of ways:


The entire group, excluding the person who said “21,” can settle on dare.
Individual players can come up with a dare for the person who said “21.”
Use an app or website to randomly generate dares.
Before starting the game, everyone can write dares down on separate slips of paper. Fold these pieces of paper in half and then put them in a bowl or a hat. When a person is forced to say “21,” they pick a random dare out of the container., Once the player completes the dare, the round is over. Determine who will start the next round. Count to 21 as a group, dare the person who said “21,” and repeat. Continue to play 21 Dares until only one player remains or your friends are ready to move on to the next activity.

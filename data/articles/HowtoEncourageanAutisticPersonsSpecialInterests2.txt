 This is a great way to get to know them and see inside their minds. Ask questions and engage in reciprocal conversation.
 While special interest talk can be a great bonding opportunity, you may find that the autistic person is more energetic than you are. Politely change the subject or bow out as needed.


"I'm feeling a little worn out, so I'm going to get some alone time now."
"I need to go finish my work. Let's talk more later."
"Cats are great, but I'm a little tired of talking about them right now. How was your day?"
You can also plan natural breaks: for example, talking about cats during the car ride, and then doing something else afterwards.
 This way, they can learn more about their interests from other experts, and talk with people who love the subject just as much as they do. Search their school, church, and local area for organizations that provide opportunities.
 Autistic people can relate to the intensity of the interest, and finding others like them can improve their self-esteem.
 If your autistic student loves fire trucks, call the fire department and see if they could arrange a class tour. If your son loves dance, take him to see The Nutcracker in the winter.
 Does your friend love to write short stories? Introduce her to your novelist uncle, or hook her up with your essayist/poet friend. This way, they can meet others one-on-one to discuss a topic they both love. They might end up making a very good friend!

, These strategies will help the autistic person find friendly people, but they won't shield them from mean people.Â Intervene if you see a problem, and comfort the autistic person by telling them that there's nothing wrong with who they are: "you're okay, they're mean."


"Hey, he's my friend. Leave him alone."
"That's rude."
"There's nothing wrong with being passionate. Stop making fun of her."
"Lay off."
"Hey, (autistic person's name), come hang out with me!"

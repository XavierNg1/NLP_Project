 When you locate a village, first check if a blacksmith is present. This is a rectangular wooden buildings with a stone roof. Besides a chest that might contain good loot, there is a square of lava. In Pocket Edition, this lava can sometimes start a fire that burns down the whole village. Scoop it up in a bucket, or cover it with a stone slab to prevent this from happening.
 If the village is large enough, an iron golem will spawn with it. If you attack or kill enough villagers, the iron golem will attack you. These are tough enemies, so do not destroy the villagers unless you are well prepared.
 Villages typically have one or more farms, with rows of crops or seeds that you can harvest to start your own farm. Less obvious loot is usually found in chests within the village's blacksmith, temple, or other buildings. Some buildings may have traps, so be careful when you explore.

 Take a large mixing bowl. Add the flour, baking soda, and spices to the bowl. Mix everything together using a fork or wire whisk until everything is mixed evenly., Use an electronic mixer at medium speed to beat the butter and sugar. Beat everything together until you have a light, fluffy butter and sugar mixture., Add the egg and vanilla. Beat the dough again, using the mixture at medium speed. Beat in the egg and vanilla until everything is mixed evenly and you have a light, fluffy mixture., Add the flour gradually. As you add the flour, continue to beat the batter. Keep adding the flour a little at a time until it's all mixed into the batter. You should have a thick, evenly mixed dough when you're done., Place the dough in a mixing bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Set it in the refrigerator and set a timer for one hour., When the dough is done cooling, remove it from the refrigerator. Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper that are lightly floured. Roll the dough out using a rolling pin until it's about 1/8 an inch thick. Then, use shamrock shaped cookie cutters to cut out your cookies., Place the cookies on a lightly greased baking sheet. Bake them 8 to 10 minutes at 375 degrees Fahrenheit.When they're done, the cookies should be lightly browned.
 Mix the milk and green food coloring in a small bowl. Then, add the confectioners' sugar. Start out with two teaspoons of milk and add another if your frosting is too thick. Mix everything together until you're left with a smooth, even green frosting.Avoid adding extra food coloring. It can cause the frosting to have a bitter taste.
 Once the frosting is done, the cookies should be cool enough to decorate. Cover each cooking with green frosting. You can use other green decorations if you want.For example, you can add green sprinkles, green M@M's, or green sugar to the frosting.

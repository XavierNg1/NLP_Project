 You can find the rubber ball from children's toy stores, and memory foam at some fabric stores or specialized online stores. You'll want a piece of memory foam roughly 3.5 x 5 inches (9 x 12.5 cm) in size, and anywhere from 1 to 3 inches (2.5â€“7.5 cm) thick. A thicker piece of memory foam will make a softer, more squeezable stress ball.
 Wrap the foam around the rubber ball and sew the memory foam together with needle and thread to enclose the ball completely. Snip off excess memory foam if necessary to make a rough spherical shape.
 An old sock will provide a durable outer covering, but you can use a thick piece of fabric instead. Snip the sock or fabric to make it a tight sphere around the memory foam. Your squeeze ball is now complete.

 When browning the beef, first coat the meat in flour before adding to the braising liquid.


This will not only help caramelize the meat for better flavor, but will also help thicken the stew later as the starch from the flour mixes with the liquid.
Once you have browned the meat, deglaze the pot by adding red wine, beer or stock for extra flavor.;
, This is one of the most common methods used to thicken beef stew. The primary protein in flour is gluten. When flour is mixed with water, the protein chains link end-to-end, which forms a web that thickens the sauce.


To create the roux, reduce the heat on the stew and remove a quantity of the stewing liquid. Heat a quantity of fat (butter works best, generally about 2 tablespoons for a decent-sized stew) in a hot pan on medium heat, and add an equal quantity by weight of white flour, whisking the flour around to prevent it burning.
Some recipes call for 6 tablespoons of flour and 4 tablespoons of butter or meat drippings to create the roux.You will end up with a whiteish-yellow paste which will melt at the edges and bubble. Keep stirring the paste around and let it darken slightly. The darker your roux, the more flavor it will add (flour gets nutty flavors as it cooks!) but the less thickening power it will have, so you want a pale roux.
 Once the paste has been thinned to the thickness of a very thick gravy, it can be stirred into your stew. It is important to cook the stew for another 5-10 minutes.


This will ensure that the flour does not add a "raw" taste, but it should not be cooked much longer than that as the thickening power of the roux will be destroyed by prolonged cooking.
Remember, the roux will reduce the intensity of the spices a bit so be sure to taste the stew to check the seasoning balance before you serve it. You could use milk instead of water to create the flour roux, although milk sticks and burns quite easily. Oatmeal or rice flour can be used instead of white flour.

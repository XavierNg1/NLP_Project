 Do some research on the topic. Whether it be online or with a dermatologist. You may think you have oily skin, but you may have combination or normal skin.;
, Buy things that you think may work and go home and use them until you run out of the product. If the product doesn't work or makes things worse, don't buy it again. Make sure to buy:


Facial soap/scrub
Repairing facial lotion with benzoyl peroxide (optional, but recommended if you have bad acne)
Anti-acne treatments suited to oily skin

, Morning and night may sound simple, but it might not work for you. Just make sure to space out your times so you're not drying out your skin too much. Before you go to work and before dinner may work, or during your lunch break and before you go to bed may work.



Normal table salt mixed with water and soap until a paste is made is a cheap way to remove oil and dirt from your face. Depending on how oily your face is once or twice a week will be enough.

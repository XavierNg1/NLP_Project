 You can go with the usual plain silver colored staples or be a little more funky and choose staples in different colors (these can be found in some stationery stores).

, Do not punch the staples with force, as the loops will come out too small for you to work with. To know how many you'll probably need, estimate the width around your wrist as follows:









Measure your wrist with a measuring tape.
Place one pressed staple on the tape to see how long it is. Use this measurement to work out how many more of this length will meet your wrist length. Use the total to punch out staples, with a few spares, just in case.
 Link the first staple with the second by sliding them together between the loops.
 Press with your fingers, tweezers or fine jewelry pliers.
 Continue to make the pressed staple chain as big as you need it to fit your wrist.
 It can be a little tricky.









Alternatively, you could add a closure clasp finding to help the bracelet open and close, but this is tricky and requires skill––only suitable for those familiar with applying such clasps.
 Enjoy wearing your staple bracelet.

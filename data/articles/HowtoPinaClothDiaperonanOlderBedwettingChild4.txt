 There are a couple of ways to do this, you can put them on the child while they are lying in bed or on the changing padâ€”in this case you have the child lift up their legs and bend them in a 90 degree angle, slide the leg holes of the pants over the child's feet then pull the pants up over their bent legs, have them lower their legs, slide the pants up, have the child lift up their bottom, then slide the pants over the diaper. After the pants are put on, turn the child over and make sure the pants are completely covering their diaper in order to prevent the diapers from leaking and getting the bed all wet. Or you can have the child stand up, step into the plastic pants, then pull them over the diapers. Some kids want to put on their own plastic pants as it gives them a feeling of some control over their being diapered for bed.

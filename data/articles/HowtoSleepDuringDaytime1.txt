There is a lot more happening during the day, including the sun shining, and it all makes it more difficult to sleep. By blocking out as much of this external stimuli as possible you can create a faux nighttime atmosphere that will help trick your body into thinking it’s nighttime bedtime.If you have children and need to be reachable for emergencies, set your phone to vibrate on their school’s number only.;

 This will help drown out the sounds of the daytime world which, as you would think, are usually much louder than the sounds of your world at night.You can also have a radio playing softly, a fan humming, or a personal audio device like an iPod playing sounds of the ocean, forest, or a river.

 Certain chemicals are just about as effective as others. To prevent insect resistance, it's a good idea to rotate different chemicals when you treat the area. Possibilities include:



Pyrethroids (cypermethrin, fenvalerate, permethrin, resmethrin, tetramethrin, s-bioallethrin, sumithrin);

Organophosphates (coumaphos, dichlorvos, malathion, tetrachlorvinphos)

Organochlorines (lindane, methoxychlor)

, Always double-check that the chemical you're using is safe to apply directly to livestock. Then:


Use a small mist blower or a handheld mist sprayer to mist the chemical over your animals.
If your animals are spooked by the sprayer, then dip a sponge or a mitt in the chemicals and rub the sponge or mitt on your animals.

Always wear rubber gloves. Never let these chemicals come into contact with your skin.
 Spray a resting areas or barns around the eaves, walls, ceiling and and rafters.


Always remove your livestock from the barn before you spray. Some of your animals may have to stay outside for a while. Just follow the directions on the packaging.
Coarsely spray resting areas with insecticides. Make sure to spray under low pressure.
Be careful not to contaminate your animals' water and feed buckets. Also, keep the spray off of your farm equipment.
 Spraying a big area is efficient; it won't require too much time or labor. However, area sprays tend to have a short-lived effect.


Use aircraft, loggers, hydraulic sprayer or mist blowers to dispense the chemicals.
The find chemical droplets will travel to where flies live, killing the insects.

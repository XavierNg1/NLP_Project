 This will be the same starting point you chose when you filled out the field for the starting point on the homepage (unless you've changed your mind and decided on a different location). When you're done, find the "Next>>" button and click it."

, The options you can choose are:


Published - Your map will be listed on Community Walk and will come up on search engines. Use this option if you're fine with having your stuff on the Internet visible to everyone.
Shareable - Your map will only be visible to people you tell about it. Use this option if you like to keep your stuff on the Internet visible to people you know.
Private - Only you can view this map. Use this option if you like to keep your stuff on the Internet only visible to you. Note that you must be logged in to use this setting.
Note that you can change your settings at any time if you wish to change them. This can be done by clicking on "My Maps," "Edit Settings," "Permissions" and clicking on a new permission. You can also click on another permission ("Save Default View," which allows any logged-in user to change the map's default view, "Change Locations," which allows any logged-in user to add, move or delete any location on the map, and "Change Own Locations," which allows any logged-in user to add locations to the map, and they can only manipulate the locations they added.)

, The title of your map should describe it concisely. For example, your map is a souvenir of a visit to Perth. In this case, you would call it "Souvenir of a Visit to Perth." When you're done, click on "Finish."


Note that this is optional, so you can skip this step if you wish to, and click on "Finish."
The title of your map can also be changed by clicking on "My Maps," clicking on the map that you would like to edit, clicking on "Main," and entering a new title in the "Title" field.

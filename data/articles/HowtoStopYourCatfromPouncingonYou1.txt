 One way that a lot of people play with kittens is by hiding their hands under fabric and having the kitten pounce on it. If you encourage your cat to play like this at a young age, they’ll keep doing it in adulthood. One way to keep your cat from pouncing on you is by teaching them early that it’s not appropriate play with you that way.Instead, encourage them to chase other toys, rather than your hands.;
, A lot of people find that their cats pounce on them while they’re sleeping, particularly on their feet. A good way to stop this is by not letting your cat pounce on you during the day. If you are already allowing this, stop it. This will eventually teach your cat it’s not okay to do at all., If your cat does pounce on you, your first reaction might be to chase your cat back. If you do this, however, your cat will think this is a fun game to play, and it will actually encourage the pouncing behavior. If they pounce on you, just walk away while saying “no.”, If your cat pounces while you’re playing, give it a “time out” by walking away. This tells your cat that certain types of play are okay, but that pouncing is bad., If all else fails and your cat keeps pouncing on you, spray them with water from a water bottle. You should spray them immediately after they pounce on you so they connect pouncing with the punishment. If your cat pounces quite a lot, you might have to carry the water bottle with you for a while.

The water bottle should be new or should never have been used for anything other than water.
Don’t spray your cat in the face when you’re using this method. Only spray their bodies.

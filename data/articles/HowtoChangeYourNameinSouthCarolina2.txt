 After marriage, you can’t change your first name, only your last. Both spouses may change their names, but whatever name you choose you must use consistently.


If you later change your mind and decide to use a different name, you’ll have to file a petition in court. For example, if as a new wife you decide to take your husband’s name, you would have to file a petition in court if a year later you both decided to use a hyphenated version of both last names.
 You want to change your name on your Social Security card first because you’ll need it to change your name on your driver’s license and to update financial and payroll accounts.You can change your name with Social Security by visiting your local SSA office and completing the application. You’ll need to show them a certified copy of your marriage certificate and your birth certificate or passport as proof of citizenship.There is no fee for a new Social Security card. After your application is received, the SSA will mail your new card to you.
 All driving records need to reflect your name change, including both your driver’s license and the title to your car.


You will have to pay $10 for a new driver’s license and $15 to have your name changed on your car title., Once your photo ID and your Social Security card reflect your new name, you should have no difficulty changing your name on your credit cards, bank accounts and other accounts or memberships.

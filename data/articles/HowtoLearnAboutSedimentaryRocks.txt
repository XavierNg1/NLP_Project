 Existing rocks are eroded mainly by water or ice, deposited in rivers, lakes and oceans. When these particles are dropped they build up gradually in layer upon layer. Over millions of years these sediments are buried deeply and are exposed to pressure and temperature turning soft sediment to rock. Collisions of continents and other forces bring these rocks to surface; are exposed and the cycle begins again.;

A conglomerate - a conglomerate is a sedimentary rock that is composed of particles of varying size and shape, such as small, medium and large round pebbles mixed with small sand grains.







Limestone - limestone is composed of calcium carbonate derived from the exoskeletons of sea life such as corals and shelled animals, it can also be precipitated by sea grasses. Lime mud and lime debris are deposited along coastlines. These are buried and slowly recrystallize into limestone.






This image shows the sea creatures encrusted within limestone.
 The most important thing to remember about sedimentary rocks is that they record the long history of our planet.

 If you are looking at less of a quick fix and more of a lifestyle change, make sure that you are getting enough sleep at night. Adults aged 18 and up need at least 7 hours of sleep. Teenagers 14-17 need 8-10 hours, while children 6-13 need 9-11 hours. , Interrupted sleep is bad sleep, and it will affect you the next day. Make sure that you put your phone on a setting that won't wake you throughout the night. If you chronically wake up multiple times a night, consult your doctor.
 Many people set multiple alarms or hit the snooze button several times before they actually wake up. Don't set an alarm at a time that is too early for you to get up just because you are counting on hitting the snooze button. Once you wake up that first time, you will no longer be getting restful sleep. Consider that before you set your alarm at night. , Even if you don't get out of bed for a few minutes, do your best to keep your eyes open. Hitting the snooze button actually hurts more than it helps. Every time you fall asleep after you hit the snooze button, you start a new sleep cycle that you will be woken up from. This makes you feel more groggy once you actually get out of bed and can affect you the rest of the day. , Try to wake up and go to sleep the same time every day. As tempting as it is, don't sleep in too much on the weekends. Having a consistent sleep schedule helps our bodies keep an internal clock and rhythm. Without consistency, our brains get confused about what time to release sleep and wake hormones and we may feel sleepy at the wrong times.

 If you can, try to figure out why she’s upset before you say anything. Quickly evaluate the situation. What has happened recently that might make her upset? Put yourself in her shoes: if something would make you unhappy, it’s very likely that it would make her unhappy too. If you can understand why she’s unhappy, you will have a much better idea of what to say and not say to make her feel better.;
, Even if you know for a fact what is wrong, you should still ask her. Asking her will help avoid problems if you have understood the situation incorrectly but it will also give her the opportunity to talk about her problems.


Be aware that she may say that nothing is wrong or she may play it off as being tired or a smaller problem than it is. If she does so, remind her that it’s okay to be upset and that you’re there to talk if she wants to.
 If she tells you what’s wrong or you would rather be more upfront with her about what you know, ask her what you can do to help her. It is important that you actually be willing to help her, though. She will not like empty offers.

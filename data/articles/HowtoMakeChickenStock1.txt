 In order to make sure you don't waste meat, plan to make stock using a chicken carcass after you've made roasted chicken. Clean the carcass of meat, so only the bones remain.


You can make this recipe with a pre-roasted chicken. Just read the ingredients and make sure the chicken doesn't contain additives.
You can make this recipe with a fresh, uncooked chicken; just be sure to remove the meat first, and save it for later.;
, Place it in a large dutch oven or stockpot. Fill the pot to within 2 inches (5.1Â cm) of the brim with water, so that the water covers the chicken carcass entirely. Place the stockpot on the stove and turn the burner to high. Bring the water to a boil.
 Turn the burner down to medium or so, so the liquid comes to a consistent simmer. Add the celery, carrots, onions, parsley and bay leaves.
 Keeping the liquid at a low simmer, cook the stock for 4 hours, uncovered. Monitor the pot to make sure it doesn't overflow, and skim off the foam every once in a while., Once the liquid has reduced by at least a third and turned a golden color, remove the stock from heat.
 Place a large strainer over a bowl and pour the stock through the strainer to remove the bones and vegetables.
 Cover the bowl of stock and put it in the refrigerator for an hour or two. As it cools, the fat will rise to the top. Use a spoon to skim it off the top before using the stock or storing it.

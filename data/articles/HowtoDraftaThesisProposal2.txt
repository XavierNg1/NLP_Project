 Knowing how a proposal is structured and what it should contain will help you outline yours. Find out if there are obligatory sections required for a proposal in your field. Your supervisor or committee might also ask you to include specific sections in your proposal.


Generally, a thesis proposal has an introduction, an abstract, a literature review, a discussion about methodology and theory, a timeline, and a bibliography.
Depending on your field, you may also present preliminary data and include appendices.
 Break down each main section into more specific subtopics. Include as many details as you can. This level of detail will make it easier to plug in information while you are writing the proposal.You do not need to know everything at this point. This is just to get you started.
For example, subtopics in the methodology section can include:

Specific novels or stories you will focus on.
Why you believe Turgenev and Tolstoy should be examined together.
How you will approach different genres.
How you will treat different stages of each authorâ€™s career.
 Your final proposal will require a bibliography, so put endnotes in your outline. You will also need to submit a timeline. Prepare for this by including notes on the outline about how and when you will accomplish each section.


This level of detail will save you time when writing the proposal.
You can also come up with a preliminary list of chapters.

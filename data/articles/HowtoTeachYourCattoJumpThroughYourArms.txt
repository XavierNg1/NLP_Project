 This is important for the set up of getting your cat in the mood to do tricks for you. If you and your cat are on good terms then your cat will be more likely to want to do what you tell it to.;
, place the food dish in front of you about 4 feet (1.2Â m) away. Use your cats' regular food, not treats. This will ensure that you can get your cat to do the trick at any meal, not just snack time.
 Place your cat behind you, through your legs, facing its food dish.
 If your cat just walks around your arms , pick the cat up and put it back in the starting position, with you in the starting position too. repeat until your cat walks through your arms to its food dish. If your cat doesn't want to do it that day, then just try again at the next meal.
, Do steps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 at every meal (cat meal) for about 3-5 days, or until your cat is used to having to walk through your arms to get to the food dish.
 Once step 6 has been accomplished to your satisfaction then you can start to lift your arm hoop up off the ground slightly more and more each time, (about 3-6 inches a week) until your cat is jumping through your arms while you're almost standing straight up.
 Now you have a jumping cat.

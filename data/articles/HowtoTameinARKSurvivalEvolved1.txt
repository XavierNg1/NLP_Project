 In order to initiate the taming process, one must render the intended animal asleep. Although many weapons are available to accomplish this, the grind of early game only presents two practical options: the bow and tranq arrows or the wooden club.


The bow and tranq arrows are ideal for ranged knock-out, and almost mandatory for taming larger starter dinos such as the trike and stego. To attain tranq arrows, see this page.
The wooden club is a melee weapon dealing more torpor damage than attack damage. Using this on smaller starter dinos, such as the dilo or the dodo, saves many resources and achieves the intended effect.;
, Dinosaurs are categorized into two basic categories: carnivores and herbivores (although certain animals require other types of consumables).


To keep the taming quarry asleep, one may need to feed the animal narcoberries or narcotics.
A taming bar, effectiveness, and unconscious meter are present on a dashboard near the unconscious tame. The taming bar becomes completely green upon a successful tame.
 Most dinos and animals require a saddle to ride, yet some do not. Although some are more expensive than others, a saddle provides armor for the tame.

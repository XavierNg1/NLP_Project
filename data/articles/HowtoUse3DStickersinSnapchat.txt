 You can swipe left and right to see the different categories.
 It will be added to the center of the screen.
 Make sure to hold it until the screen pauses. The video will pause, and you can drag your sticker around.Try to do this during a part of the video where the object is clearly in the frame.
 This will "pin" the sticker to the object, and the sticker will follow the object around and scale as it moves closer to and farther from the lens., You can see how well the sticker tracks the object in the preview of the Snap. Note that this feature is still new, and may not always work correctly.
 Test out different things you can attach stickers to. You'll get better results by attaching stickers to slower moving objects that don't get blurry.
 Got something in your video you don't want others to see? You can pin a 3D sticker to it, and it will remain covered throughout the entire clip, even as the camera moves around. The sticker will automatically resize as necessary.
 3D stickers work great for replacing your pet's face with a smiley face. Take a video of your pet and pin a sticker to it. The sticker should track your pet's face as it moves in your video.
 You can pin more than one emoji to your video at once, allowing different emoji to track different objects. There is no practical limit to the number of emoji that you pin to objects.
 The object you pin an emoji to doesn't have to start in the video. If you pause and attach an emoji to an object that appears half-way through the video, the emoji won't appear until the object appears.

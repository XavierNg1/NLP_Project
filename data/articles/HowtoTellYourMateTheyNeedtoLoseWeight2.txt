 Growing attention is being placed on the societal bias against heavy people by physicians, corporations, insurance agencies, the media, clothing stores, employers, potential and by current romantic partners.Achieving a healthy weight will make your mate more likely to receive less judgmental healthcare from a primary care provider, may reduce health insurance costs, may make him or her more appealing to hire or promotable, will make shopping for clothes more enjoyable, and will reduce your mate’s experience of social stigma attached to weight.
Individuals at a healthier weight are more likely to have a satisfying love life. Those at a healthy weight are less likely to experience sexual dysfunction,and people of average weight are also more likely to rate their sexual health and satisfaction positively., Individuals at an average weight experience less depression, fewer eating disorders, and lower rates of other mental disorders.Showing your mate that healthier weight may equate to a happier life– less likely to include negative self-image and other stresses and worries associated with extra weight – may be the stimulus he or she needs to work toward serious weight loss goals.
 Carrying a significant amount of excess weight contributes to multiple diseases.


Even just a few extra pounds increases your mate’s risk of heart disease,certain types of cancer,diabetes,hypertension, sleep apnea,and high cholesterol,among other conditions.
Excess weight may also inhibit recovery from certain illnesses and surgeries, prevent the provision of certain life-saving treatment or rescue services, and complicate the administration of effective medications and medical treatments.Women who are significantly overweight are also at increased risk of gestational diabetes, pregnancy complications and cesarean sections, birth defects in babies, and other maternal health complications.

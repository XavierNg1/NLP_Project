 Any time you're planting a new garden bed or even potting a houseplant, it's a good idea to fertilize it to give it a head start. Work compost into the soil, sprinkle meal into the holes you dig, or scatter granular fertilizer over newly tilled ground.Remember that nitrogen helps stems and leaves grow strong, phosphorus fosters a healthy root system, and potassium gives plants a healthy shape with beautiful blossoms. Each type of plant has different needs, so conduct research or ask an expert at your local nursery if you're not sure exactly what to feed your plants.
 Try not to wait until a problem crops up before feeding your plants. Keep track of when they were last fertilized and plan on feeding them again every few months during the growing season.
 If your plants have yellow or brown spots, limp leaves, or other problems, they are likely to be undernourished. You can buy fertilizer sprays that are intended to help immediately revive plants that are in distress.

 Select the pages list from the "Pages" menu. You will see thumbnails of the pages. Above these are the Master Pages. If you change an element on a Master Page, all the document pages that draw formatting from it also will change. To change an element on a Master Page:


Determine which Master Page element you want to change. Master Page elements have broken-line borders.
Hold down "Command+Shift" on a Mac OS, or "Ctrl+Shift" on a PC, and click the item on the Master Page that you want to unlock. Once you click it, the item is released from the Master Page.
Make your changes to the Master element you selected. All document pages should reflect the change you made.
Go to the "Pages" menu and select "Override All Master Page Items" to effectively unlock them for changes if you would like to update multiple items at the same time.

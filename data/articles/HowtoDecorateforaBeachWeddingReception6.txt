 If your beach wedding reception is outdoors, it is important to prepare for unpredictable weather. As you plan your decorations, keep unpredictable weather in mind.


Rent a tent for your wedding reception. Most event tents come with sides that roll up, so if the weather is nice, you can roll up the sides of the tent and let guests enjoy the beautiful beach views. In the event of rain, intense wind or cold temperatures, you can unroll the sides of the tent to protect your guests from the weather.
Rent space heaters. Even in the summer, ocean-side temperatures can cool significantly in the evening. Keep guests warm by placing space heaters throughout the reception area.
Use sturdy decorations. Because beaches typically are more windy than protected inland locations, decorations need to be sturdy enough not to blow away in wind gusts. Anchor decorations with rocks or heavy shells, or look for centerpieces with wide bases.

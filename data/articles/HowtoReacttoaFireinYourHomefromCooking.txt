 Quickly decide if you can safely extinguish the fire. If not, direct someone to call emergency services and quickly, but calmly, leave the house. If the fire is small enough and it appears that you can extinguish it, proceed with utmost caution.;
, Your smoke alarm should have already done so, but if for some reason it didn't, make sure that everyone in the house knows about the fire and can quickly get to safety.
 If you can safely and quickly do so, try smothering out the fire. You can use one or more of the following methods to smother a grease/oil fire:


Use an appropriate fire extinguisher if available.
Cover the fire with a tight fitting lid if possible. Alternatively you could slide a cookie sheet over a pan that is on fire.
Use baking soda or any dry powder such as flour, pancake mix, etc. to smother the fire.
 Ask any of the firefighters that are stopping the fire to remind you when the fire is over. Listen and wait for their responses when it's safe to go back in. If the fire was a light one be sure you got the fire and it has no chance of coming again.
 The most important thing you can do in the case of a cooking fire is to remain calm and stay in control. Taking charge of the situation can help reduce anxiety and help keep you calm. Take a few deep breaths and find ways to access the situation safely.
 A fire is not something funny and can be deadly so do not take your situation as a game or joke. Take action seriously and do not play around with the fire.
 Whether you started the fire or not, no one should be blamed. If you start blaming others a fight can start and you may forget about the fire. Focus on what's happening rather than the cause of the danger.
 Use common sense and knowledge when trying to stop the fire. Ask yourself, "Do I need to call Emergency Services? Do I need help? What should I do?" If the fire is very serious you might have to call Emergency Services. If the fire is small you can try putting the fire out yourself.

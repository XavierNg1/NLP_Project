 You can choose binding that is in a contrasting or similar color to the fleece, depending upon your preference.

You can also make your own binding. Cut out long 3-inch (7.6-cm) wide pieces of ribbed knit. Make sure the ribbing runs perpendicular to the cut. Fold the knit along the width and iron it to crease the fabric. Fold the unfinished edges in toward the center crease on each side. Iron the folds again to create your strips of binding.
 A 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) piece of binding should extend on either side of the fleece., When 1 piece of binding ends, overlap the binding with another piece and pin it in place., You can use a contrasting thread color or the same color as the binding., Cut the strips., Pin 2 of them together with the right sides inwards., Sew a 1/16 inch (0.16 cm) stitch in a rectangle around the line you have just drawn on both sides. Make sure you sew through both pieces of binding.

Repeat with the second set of bindings to make your other arm binding. These sewn sections will help your bindings to stay flat and together on either side of the arm slits.
 They will remain stitched together on the edges so there is a continuous binding in the arm holes. Fold in the raw ends by 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) and press with an iron., Hand sew with an edge stitch around the perimeter of the binding to affix it to your fleece., When you place your arms through the arm holes, the top of the circle should fold down over the tops of your shoulders and make a lapel on your chest.

 Puppies are naturally curious, so they might get into a bit of trouble. However, if your puppy does something you do not approve of, never resort to hitting your puppy. This can cause your puppy to become fearful, anxious, or even angry or mean itself. There are better, more effective ways to punish your puppy.


If your puppy gets into trouble, say a firm, “No,” and make it sit. Once it sits like you told it to, give it a treat to reward the good behavior.
You can also use remote correction to correct your puppy’s behavior. This is so your puppy will not associate you with the correction. For example, use a hand-held air horn to correct your puppy’s behavior. Sound off the air horn behind your back so your puppy does not see that you did it. Or, rattle a can containing coins or pebbles behind your back., Never punish your puppy after the fact. If you punish it after the fact, your puppy will have no idea why you are punishing it because the offense happened too long ago. Therefore, you will not be able to correct the behavior, and your puppy will not understand why you are punishing it., Puppies confined in crates or cages for long periods may develop disturbing habits, like eating its feces. This is usually caused by boredom. If do not have any one to watch your puppy while you're at work, place your puppy and its crate inside a small room in your house. Then, create a bathroom area in the room by placing newspapers in a corner away from the crate.

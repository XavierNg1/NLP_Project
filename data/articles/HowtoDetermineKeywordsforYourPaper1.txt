 Most of your keywords should focus on the main topic of your paper. Because you wrote the paper, you will know what words best describe your topic. Think about your thesis and your overall theme. What’s the main focus?


Are you writing about the behavioral issues that cats exhibit? Are you writing about Lincoln’s contribution to the Civil War?;
, Try to focus on the theme of your paper and sum it up in one to three words. These are the words that most accurately relate to the theme of your paper. For example:


Maybe your keywords could be “cat behavioral problems” for a paper on behavioral issues that cat’s exhibit.
Your keywords could be “Lincoln’s war influence” if your article is about Lincoln’s contribution to the Civil War.
 Consider the key points that you try to convey in your paper. What are the sub topics you discuss in order to prove your thesis?


For a paper about cat behavioral issues, you may talk about how cats interact with kittens, aggressive behaviors, loving behaviors, and behaviors that represent depression.
 Distill these main points down into one, two, or three word groupings that effectively summarize the points that you made to prove your thesis. For the example of the cat article you may write something like:


”Cat interactions kittens” or “aggression cats”.
 When writing your keywords, you do not need to create full sentences. In fact, you should leave out things like prepositions and articles because search engines tend to filter out these words anyway.


Prepositions describe the relationship between two words in a sentence. They include words like “in”, “between”, “before”, etc.There are only two articles, “a” and “the”.

 How much you need to cut off will depend on how large the flowers are to begin with. It will also depend on how large you want your bouquet to be. When you cut the bottom of the stem, cut it at an angle – this makes it easier for the flower to soak up the water.
 Removing extra leaves increases the longevity of the flowers. How far down the stem you should remove extra leaves varies. You should remove enough so if you’re storing them in water, the leaves won’t be submerged. If you’re not storing them in water, remove enough so that you enough room to hold the bouquet., This is good whether you’re making a bouquet for a table or for a wedding. You’ll need to keep wedding flowers in water until they are ready to go. Fill the vase about two thirds of the way full with clear, fresh water.

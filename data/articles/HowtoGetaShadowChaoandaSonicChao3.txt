, Sonic Chao are classified as Neutral/Run/Run Chao, which means they are Neutral (raised by both Hero and Dark evenly, or raised from birth in Sonic Adventure DX or the original Sonic Adventure), primarily run oriented at the time of first evolution. (you can change your chaos evolution path: I once changed my would be Neutral/Fly Chao into Neutral/Swim just before she evolved.). The second Run ( Neutral/Run/Run) means that, although you can still raise other stats besides run (give it other colored animals and drives), it is yet again primarily Run oriented. The Chao can change appearances still, as the Second Evolution (the one a Neutral/Run/Unevolved takes from Green to Blue with a blackish stomach) is gradual (it won't happen right away), and can change; a Neutral/Run/Run can easily become a Neutral/Run/Power with primarily Power (red) Chaos Drives and animals being given to it.

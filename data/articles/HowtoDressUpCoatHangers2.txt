 Wooden coat hangers are too nice to cover up!

, The strip should measure about 1 meter (1 yard) length by 10cm (4 inches) wide.
 Stitch so that it remains wound in place around the hanger. Focus on keeping it smooth, so that there will be no evident bumps when the fabric covers it.


This forms the soft wadding against which your clothes will sit when hung.
 Get the exact shape, as this will form a template. Draw an additional seam allowance around the template of 2cm or 3/4 of an inch. Cut out the paper template.
 Draw around the shape or pin it in place. Cut out the fabric piece. Repeat one more time, to get two pieces of fabric in the same shape.
 Allow for the seam allowance all the way around, as you pin.
 Hand stitch the two pieces of fabric together. As you stitch, pull the fabric tightly around the padding over the hanger. Finish off with a neat and tight knot.



If the hook is ugly on its own, consider winding yarn around it––coat the hook in glue first, then carefully wind on the yarn. Allow to dry, then add the ribbon embellishment.
 The padded coat hanger is now ready for keeping your clothes in great shape.

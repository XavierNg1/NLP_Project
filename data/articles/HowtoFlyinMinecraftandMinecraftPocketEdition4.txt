 You can only fly in Creative Mode. You choose the game mode when you create the world, and there is no built-in way to change it.


You can search your app store for a mod that allows you to change game modes. However, most of these do not work for Minecraft PE versions 0.9 and later.If you do download a mod, be aware that it is not officially supported and could cause issues with your game.
 If you are in Creative Mode, you should start flying. On some versions, the jump symbol will change to a pair of wings., Hold the jump button and swipe your finger up to fly higher, or down to sink lower. You can also move using the usual controls.


You can also drop down by double-tapping the center jump button.If you are playing on the Xperia Play gamepad, hold jump while pressing up or down.

 However, she MUST enjoy having you as a friend, and treats you well. If she does turn her back against you, she might pass on dirty secrets/rumors/dirty pieces of gossip about you. This will only bring you down to a beta.;
, Having friends with both good and different personalities is more important than having friends who share only all of your interests. You can convert them to whatever you like, which raises your social standing.
 Know how to manage your social life without trying too hard.
 You can be a total brat without people being able to call you out on it. ie. "That outfit is so cute! I love that you still wear GAP, even though most of us gave that up a few years ago! You're always so original with your style". Don't act bratty for no reason. Such tactics are only to be used for self-defense.
 Save your vulnerability for a few chosen friends who you know won't tell everyone your problems/secrets/whatever.

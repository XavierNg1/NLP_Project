 Developmental anomalies – abnormal instance of growth or development – could indicate the presence of a primary immunodeficiency. Developmental anomalies might appear in the heart, pigmentation of the skin, skeleton, or face.For instance, if your child gets a checkup and the doctor finds that they have a structural defect or cardiomyopathy (a condition in which the heart struggles to deliver blood to the body), a primary immunodeficiency could be the cause., Failure to thrive is a condition in which your child cannot gain weight or grow at a healthy rate.If your child has failed to thrive – due, perhaps, to a recurring illness – this could be an important clue as to whether they have a primary immunodeficiency. Take your child to the doctor for regular checkups as they grow.Failure to thrive is typically diagnosed when your child is just a baby. As a baby, your child should double in weight over its first four months.
By 12 months old, your baby should have tripled its weight.
Your child’s doctor will be able to tell you how often they should be seen and what you can do to correct the failure to thrive, even if it’s not caused by a primary immunodeficiency.
 Another childhood condition that could provide evidence of a primary immunodeficiency is developmental delay.This describes a range of potential conditions and behaviors. If you have concerns about your child’s development, contact your doctor so they can diagnose your child.A developmental delay might mean that the child:


does not learn at the same rate as their peers
cannot speak or understand speech at an age-appropriate level
has trouble with coordination, mobility, or balance
does not engage in social behavior appropriate for their age

, Either mild or severe chronic infections may also indicate that a child may have a primary immunodeficiency. Tell your child’s doctor about any infections the child has had, including:skin infections
colds
ear infections
lung infections
allergies

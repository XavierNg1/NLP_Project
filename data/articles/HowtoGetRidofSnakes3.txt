 Snakes’ typical habitats contain tall grass and bushes, so regularly cutting your grass and trimming bushes and shrubs will make your yard less enticing for snakes. Mow your lawn and remove any downed tree trunks, hollow stumps, or other places where snakes could live.Take these measures to make sure your yard isn’t full of potential snake dens:









Store lumber and woodpiles at least 2 feet (0.6 m) off the ground, and keep compost and mulch piles away from your house.
Consider removing bushes and other tall vegetation that seems to be a regular habitat for snakes.
 Snakes eat mice, crickets, and other insects. If you take measures to keep the populations of these creatures low, snakes will look elsewhere for food. Use soil and rocks to block up any rodent holes in your backyard.Keep your yard free of birdseed, berries, and nuts that have fallen from trees, and stray bits of waste from the compost pile. These are all food sources for mice and insects.


Consider removing mice and insects from your property by setting traps or using other removal methods. See How to Get Rid of Mice and How to Get Rid of Crickets for more ideas.
 Prevent snakes from entering your home by checking its foundation for cracks and holes. Seal any that you find with caulk or expanding foam. Make sure that your doors and windows are sealed, too. Place screens on your chimney, vents, and other places where snakes might be able to get in.








The grid of the screens should not have openings larger than ¼ inch (0.6 cm), in order to effectively block all snakes.

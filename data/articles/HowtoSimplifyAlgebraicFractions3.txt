 For example, let’s say we have the equation:
3(x-4)
5(4-x)

Notice how (x-4) and (4-x) are ‘’almost’’ identical, but you can’t cross them out because they are reversed. However, (x - 4) can be written as -1 * (4 - x) in the same way that you rewrite (4 + 2x) as 2 * (2 + x). This is called “factoring out the negative.”
-1 * 3(4-x)
5(4-x)

Now we can easily remove the two identical (4-x):
-1 * 3(4-x)
5(4-x)


Leaving us with our final answer -3/5

, The difference of two squares is simply one squared number subtracted by another, like the expression (a2 - b2). The difference of perfect squares always simplifies into two parts, adding and subtracting the square roots. In every case, you can simplify the difference of perfect square as follows:a2 - b2 = (a+b)(a-b)

This can be incredibly helpful when trying to find like terms in algebraic fractions.


Example: x2 - 25 = (x+5)(x-5)

, Polynomials are complex algebraic expressions with more than two terms, like x2 + 4x + 3. Luckily, many polynomials can be simplified using polynomial factorization. The previous expression, for example, can be rewritten as (x+3)(x+1).
 This is especially helpful in expressions with exponents, like x4 + x2. You can remove the largest exponent as a factor. In this case, x4 + x2 = x2(x2 + 1).

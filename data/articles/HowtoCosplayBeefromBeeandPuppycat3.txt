 Buy a white motorcycle helmet, cut ears out of felt and attach them to the top of the helmet. Paint two Styrofoam balls pink and glue them in the ears as shown. If you're really creative, add the pink visor, however your outfit will still be recognizable without it.
 Don't forget to make the pink knee pads out of felt or fabric, then sew them onto your jumpsuit., Put on brown boots and elbow-length brown gloves, and get creative to make the large bell around her neck and the big round pink shoulder pads. This is by far the hardest part, but it does bring the entire outfit together. You could try building a giant replica of the bell and then sewing on the shoulder pads, or simply tie a bell around your neck with a ribbon and forego the shoulder pads.

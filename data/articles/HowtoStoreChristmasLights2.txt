 Make sure you rinse out the inside of the tube- this isn't to protect your lights, but if there are crumbs left inside it could attract bugs to your storage area.


As an alternative, you could also use the cardboard tube from a paper towel roll for this method. The steps will be the same, except you won't be placing a lid on the cardboard tube.
 Using a pair of heavy scissors, cut a vertical slit on the top of the can. The slit should be about an inch long., You can widen the slit with further cutting if the wire from the lights won't fit.
 Work your way down to the bottom of the can, then go back up to the top. Tuck the end of the lights into the same slit at the top of the can. This should leave you with the lights wrapped around the can with both ends resting in the slit on top., This will prevent the ends from slipping out of the slit and unraveling your lights during storage.
 To protect the lights during storage, you can wrap a few layers of tissue paper around the can. This should be done especially if you're placing the lights in a box with other items.

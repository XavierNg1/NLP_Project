 This method actually works a little better when your hair isn't freshly washed. Wait until it has been a day or so since your last shampoo. If you want to spruce up your roots, use dry shampoo instead of wetting your hair., Squirt some extra-strength gel onto your hand and run it up the section of hair from the roots to the tips. Hold it in place for a moment to make sure it stays spiked., Grab a section of hair at a time and apply the gel in the same way. Make the spikes even, or alternate smaller spikes with larger ones. Continue until you've made as many spikes as you desire., For extra hold, spray the spikes with some hair spray before you go about your day. Wearing a headband could also help to hold them in place.

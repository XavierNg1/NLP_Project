 Gather a small section of your hair and brush it to remove any tangles. Turn on a flat iron to the lowest setting (usually around 250-300 degrees F) and once it's warm, run it through the strand. Continue running the flat iron over the section of hair until the section is smooth and straight.Each section will end up being a curl. For many small curls, keep the sections small. You should also make sure the sections aren't too large or the pin clips won't be able to hold the hair.
 With the flat iron on the lowest setting, run it through the straight strand of hair. Wind the hair backwards away from your face so that the strand curls onto the flat iron. Do this slowly so that the hair curls. Keep the temperature of the flat iron low so that it doesn't melt your synthetic hair.The curl doesn't have to be perfect. You're just getting a basic curl shape that you'll wind and pin to your head.
 While the curl is still warm, wrap it tightly around your index finger. Gently slide the curl off of your finger and hold it between your thumb and index finger. The curl will look like a flat, circular twist of hair. Bring the curl to your scalp and pin it to your head using a small metal hair clip.If you want the curls to hold longer, you can spray the curl with hair spray before you wrap and pin them.
 Straighten, curl and pin the rest of your hair. You may find it easier to curl and pin the hair closest to your temples (if curling a weave). This will keep the hair out of your face. Once you've pinned all of your synthetic hair, let them rest in the pins overnight or at least for several hours. Remove the clips and run your fingers through the curls.To get a more natural look, you can run your fingers in between curls to divide them and give your hair more body.

 An important element of sharing is also asking your contacts to forward on what you've shared. This is how the power of social media manifests its strength and it is important to encourage others to be agents of change with you. For example, you may ask them to "RT" or retweet your messages on Twitter. The ripple effect of sharing, where if everyone has ten contacts, one person will affect ten, ten hundred, hundred thousand, and thousand ten thousand, is the social media guarantee that when a cause or protest takes hold, and all those connected will hear the message and join in.


In return, always do the same for those sharing your message if they're also providing relevant and important information; share their information too.
Join with like-minded people and civil society organizations, and share their updates as well as your own.
 There are many things you can share when the cause or protest takes off but it will depend on what the issue is and whether you're targeting people who are supporting via social media or people who are actively pursuing political change on-the-ground. Some ideas of what you might wish to share include:


Background information as to what the cause is, what you believe needs changing and why
Information that people can verify if they ask questions or are asked questions
What is going on in your area in terms of government, corporate, institutional, or military action (including photos and video, if you can)
Tips on how people can protect themselves against riot control agents, arrest, or against search and seizure, etc.

Emergency numbers for use in case protesters are arrested; bail options and ways people online might be able to help raise bail if relevant
Blueprints of where to go and what supplies to take; whether it's a peaceful demonstration or a riotous protest, keeping people in the know is a way of helping them stay safe and informed
Messages of support and solidarity to boost protesters' morale
Tips for how to bypass government censorship or read between the lines of propaganda
Actions that can be taken by the average citizen not actually participating or not even in the same country, such as filling in petitions, writing to officials and committees, spreading information in their own communities, donating money, raising awareness via their own websites or workplaces, etc., and provision of pro forms or templates is often very helpful to guide people.

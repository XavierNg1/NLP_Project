 You will need a conference room to meet with your customers and with your employees (in two different sessions).
 Ask 6-10 customers to meet with you for a couple of hours to discuss about your product category. It's even better if this session is managed by an outside research firm, but if you are short of time and budget you can do it yourself.
 They have to write down the brand they recall without help. Then they have to agree about the relative positions: who is the first brand, who is the second and so on.
 Again they have to write them down and order them from the most important to the least important.
 This is the key and fun part: you ask your customers or prospects to match a brand with one and only one feature. In this way you can see which brand '"owns"' which feature. This will let you see if there are important features you can own.
 With the info you have gathered in the session with your customers and prospects you now have a "map" to evaluate potential positioning for your brand. It's even entirely possible that you have no simple positioning strategy available and you have to think outside the box and revise your product offer

, You have actionable data to write the Positioning Statement that will guide all your marketing activities (see How to Write a Positioning Statement)

 Place the beans in a strainer. Run cool, clean water over the beans. Lightly agitate the strainer after rinsing the beans. This will help drain any remaining water and debris., You will need a large pot to cook the basic flageolet beans. Once you locate the pot, place the beans in the pot. Add half of the water to the pot and cover with a lid., Place the pot on the stove. Turn the burner to medium high. Bring the beans to a boil. This will take anywhere from 2-5 minutes. Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to medium low. Cook the beans on medium-low heat for 60-90 minutes, or until they are tender when you pierce them with a fork.

Be sure to keep the beans covered with water while cooking.
Add additional water to the pot if necessary to keep the beans covered.
 Once the beans are tender, remove the pot from the stove. Season with salt and pepper, if desired. Serve the beans by themselves, or as a side dish.

 Use only a thin layer of jelly--it shouldn't be a big glob that is about to fall off the cotton swab.


Make sure you are using a trusted brand of highly refined petroleum jelly. It is a byproduct of oil refining and is found in different grades of purity. If it's not properly purified it can contain harmful toxins., Wait a few seconds, then use the clean end to gently wipe away the eyeliner and petroleum jelly.Use another, clean cotton swab if you don't get all your eyeliner off with the first one.
 If you see any smears under or above your lashes, run a clean cotton swab over the area to remove the remaining makeup.


If you get any petroleum jelly in your eyes, rinse with warm water. It may cause your vision to blur temporarily.

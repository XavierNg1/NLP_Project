 Observe what the child is doing, wait for their cues, and listen to your child's words, sounds or sentences. You can then learn what you need to build on.


Ex. if the child uses sounds "pah" or "bah” you could model an emphasize words for them to use when they make those sounds like "park” or "ball”. Face to face is the best place to be using OWL.




Include your child's interest.

Intrude in what they are doing (gently, of course!). If your child likes to sit alone studying their dolls, cars, or books, try playing next to them. You don't need to get a dialogue going; silent interaction or peaceful parallel play also work.

Imitate. If they are spinning or sitting looking through a book, then sit or stand next to them and do what they are doing. See if they stop what they are doing to look at your book. If they come over start talking about the book you are reading and the pictures. If they don't, then they are probably just enjoying your company.



Repeat what you say and do
Offer opportunities for your child to take their turn
Cue your child to take their turn
Keep it fun! Keep communication going!

 Let the yeast dissolve in the water.;
, At a low pace or speed, mix the ingredients well, as you also want to scrape and fold in the mixture. Do this for 30 seconds.
 Continue scraping and folding. Put in the rest of the flour and stir the mixture until it's smooth.
 You'll want to store it in a warm place. The dough will be ready when the indentation stays intact when you touch it; meaning, if you press the dough with your finger, it will stay pressed down instead of bouncing back up.
 Scoop the dough onto the floured surface and roll the dough around softly so that it's coated. Carefully roll the dough into 1/2 inch (1.3cm) thick pieces with a rolling pin (preferably floured so that the dough does not stick to pin). Use a doughnut cutter on each piece, giving them a hole in the middle.
, Using the sides of the deep fryer and a wide spatula, slide the doughnut batter into the oil. Turning them about 1 minute on each side, fry the batter until you get a golden brown color.
 Be sure to avoid pricking the surface of the doughnuts.
 Let the doughnuts cool down and then use the chocolate glaze as a spread.

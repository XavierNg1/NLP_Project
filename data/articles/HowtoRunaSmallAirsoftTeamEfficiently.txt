 It is often their first instinct to start assigning roles like:

Sniper.



 


Spotter.






Recon.






Special ops.






Demolition.






Point man.






CQB specialist.






Support gunner.






Designated marksman.






Communications expert.






Etc.;
,, Having a team with no organization means that the team will not be following a coherent plan once fighting breaks out.
 That way, tactics such as leapfrogging, flanking, etc. can be used effectively. With only one group, the leader will have to designate certain players to do a certain thing each time he wants to employ a tactic. This would take up too much time during a firefight. With more than two teams, each unit will be too small to be effective. Only two groups are needed for most basic tactics.

The two elements should be approximately equal in terms of the players' skill and weapons. Each should have one leader. The two should ideally be equipped with radios. Out of the squad leaders, one is also the team leader.






Everyone on a four man team should be a rifleman. There is no need for more advanced roles.If you have six or more it could be necessary to have more advanced positions.






Instead of having one man do scout or recon work, the entire team should move. Recon elements are only necessary for large teams.






Support gunners are not necessary. When one squad is supposed to give suppressing fire, both team members should do this.






With so few players, any "sniper" should stay with the squad to act as a rifleman. Designated marksman are also not necessary with such a small team. Once a rifleman cannot make a shot, he can simply tell another who is capable to do so.

 That way your laptop is less likely to wear out quickly.;
, Cheap or second hand or reconditioned laptops are cheaper than new laptops.But often they are not as good as a brand new more expensive laptop.And bear in mind that second hand laptops have been used before by someone else and so may be faulty. So a good new laptop is likely to last longer or forever if you look after it.
 That way if your computer does wear out and you end up being forced to buy a Windows 8 laptop. You can install Windows 7 on the Windows 8 computer. After you have wiped off Windows 8 by formatting the hard drive. Also if you have Windows Vista and Windows XP installation CDs you can install that on the Windows 8 computer or laptop if you prefer.
 Now buy as many Windows 7 and Windows XP laptops as you can,10 or maybe 20 computers. While you can still get them in the shops now.And put them away in a cupboard somewhere.Then when the laptops you are using now wear out,you will have enough Windows 7 laptops to last you for the next 20 years. And you will never have to go on Windows 8 or be in a situation where you will be stuck with Windows 8.
 Many people are unhappy with Microsoft's decision to keep the Metro theme. And feel if there must be a Windows 8, it should have a normal desktop and start menu like Windows 7. Not the Metro theme. So if enough Windows users complained about this. Then maybe Microsoft will back down and make Windows 8 with a normal desktop and start menu.

 The dremel will be doing all the cutting in this method, but you need to know where to cut. Use two strips of masking tape placed very close together (but not touching!) to form a thin line around the bottle where you want to cut.
 Attach a glass-cutting bit to the end of the dremel. Work your way around, slowly cutting the glass along the taped line. You may have to go over the same section multiple times in order to get a clean cut.
 When the bottle snaps along the line, you will probably have some jagged edges that need smoothing. Use a rough grit of sandpaper to smooth down the sharp pieces, and then transition into using a fine grit to make a soft surface. You're finished!

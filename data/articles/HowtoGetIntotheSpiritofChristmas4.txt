 If you are not able to visit or see your family for Christmas, try Skyping or Facetiming them on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day to stay connected. Though you may not be able to be with them in person, speaking to them may remind you that you are loved and missed and you can remind your family of the same. It may be bittersweet but you may feel more spirited after a fun chat with loved ones.
 If you have extra time or money during the holidays, consider volunteering your time or buying Christmas gifts for those in need. Ring a bell for Salvation Army, donate food to food banks, purchase toys for the ToysForTots program, or search online for any places you can donate near you.Animal shelters usually list the items that they are in need of on their website. You could purchase some of the items on the list to assist them.
Salvation Armyâ€™s website lists ways that you can give or volunteer at a location near you during the holiday season., A great way to try getting into the Christmas spirit is to create your own tradition! It can sometimes be discouraging when you are away from your family members. Think of something fun that you would enjoy doing. Perhaps you could treat yourself to a spiked eggnog or another adult Christmas treat. The best thing about being an adult is deciding what you would like to do with your time off of work.

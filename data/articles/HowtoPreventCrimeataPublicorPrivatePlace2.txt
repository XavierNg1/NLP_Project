 You can limit the amount of crime in a place by limiting the number of people who enter that place. This will require limiting the number of pedestrian footpaths into and around a building.


For example, crime has been reduced in public housing by limiting the number of pedestrian routes through the project.Obviously, you can’t limit all footpaths or routes. However, by limiting some, you can make sure that pedestrian routes are in highly-visible locations.
 If you run a large building, you should make the lobby the sole place for entering and exiting. Ideally, you can staff the lobby with someone who screens people entering or exiting the building.


Issue identification cards to tenants, which will prevent strangers from attempting to enter the building.
 Criminals are less likely to offend if they can get caught. Lighting your pedestrian routes is a good way to make criminals visible to other people.


Also make sure the lighting is sufficient in the lobby so that your door person can see all people in the lobby.
 A rundown building can draw more criminals to it than a building that is kept up. Improve the appearance of your buildings by adding a fresh coat of paint and eliminating any graffiti. Mow the lawn regularly and trim hedges.


When a building is rundown, criminals might suspect that property management is lax. By keeping your building in good shape, you signal that someone is keeping an eye on the building.
 Drug dealers are magnets for crime in residential buildings. You should evict any drug dealers as soon as possible, which is an effective crime prevention method.Pay attention to police visits to your buildings and whether tenants have been criminally convicted of drug possession or dealing.


Write into your lease requirements that tenants not commit crimes in the building.
Work with a lawyer to legally evict someone. Remember that you can’t use self-help. For example, you cannot cut off someone’s utilities or change the locks on their doors.

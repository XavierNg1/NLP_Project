 To have full rights to custody or visitation, the father must be recognized as a legal parent.Once paternity is legally recognized, he has rights to custody or visitation, and also the obligation to child support. It is illegal to have a child and not pay toward his or her well-being.
 This is the simplest way to establish paternity.This can be done at your local court, welfare office, family law facilitator or registrar of births.
You can also receive the form by mail and sign it before a notary public.



POP is a program in the California Department of Child Support Services that acts as a court. Once your declaration is filed here, the declaration will be legally binding and you will have custody rights.
You will need to apply for a new birth certificate with the father's name afterward.



You can find your family law facilitator by following the link for your county from the California Courtâ€™s Family Law Facilitators List.
 This will need to be signed by both parties once the father has been established as having the rights and responsibilities of a legal parent.


In order to fill out this form, you will need to come to a custody and visitation agreement.
 You need to make a copy for yourself and for the other parent. The original will be filed with the court.
 The court will stamp the papers as "filed," keeping the original and returning the copies to you.


Once the forms are filed, the court has approved the order and it is legally binding.

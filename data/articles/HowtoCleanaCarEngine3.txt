 Battery terminals often corrode, which can lead to issues with the electrical system of your vehicle. Remove the cables on the battery and use a wire brush to scrub the terminals until they are clean, exposed metal.Soaking the ends of the battery cables in an anti-corrosion chemical like CLR can also help ensure a strong electrical connection.
 If the battery has corrosion caused by leaking battery acid, you can neutralize it as you clean by using a combination of baking soda and water. Pour a bit of baking soda into a bucket of water and mix it thoroughly. Dip your brush in the mixture and use that to scrub the battery terminals and any other areas acid may have leaked.Baking soda makes for an effective cleaning solution as well as a neutralizer for the battery acid.
 Plastic parts of your engine, such as engine covers and reservoir caps may be difficult to scrub clean. Start by using a stiff toothed, plastic bristled brush along with car wash soap or degreaser. Once the hard to remove grime has been removed, use a sponge with car wash soap to get the last of the grime off before rinsing the pieces with water.You may choose to remove the components to clean them out of the engine bay, but it is not required.
Avoid using steel toothed brushes on plastic as it may cause scratches.
 Brake cleaner breaks up grime and evaporates quickly. Insert the straw into the nozzle of the brake cleaner and direct it at hard to clean spots or areas where the grime is particularly thick. Use a hard toothed brush to scrub the grime away, then spray it again with brake cleaner to rinse it.Be careful using brake cleaner in enclosed areas as the fumes can be hazardous.
Brake cleaner is extremely flammable, so donâ€™t use it while smoking or near flames.

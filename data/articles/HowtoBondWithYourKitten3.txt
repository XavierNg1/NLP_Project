 Introducing a kitten to another cat or a dog when you first adopt it can be a traumatizing incident for the kitten, since it will already be nervous and in an unfamiliar environment.Let the kitten get used to your living space before you introduce other pets.


You can begin to introduce your kitten to other animals when it’s between 3 and 7 weeks, as long as the kitten is comfortable in its environment.When you bring the kitten and another pet into the same room, give them time to sniff each other. If one or both animals are skittish, try giving them each a bowl of food or a couple treats. This will calm the animals down, and help the older pet develop positive associations with the new kitten.
 Make sure that all human interactions with your kitten are positive, gentle, and kind, especially while your kitten is still very young. Especially before 12 weeks of age, kittens are very fragile. If the kitten is around children or other individuals who may treat it carelessly, it could be dropped and injured.It’s fine for your kitten to meet other people, but if you want your kitten to bond most closely with you, you should be the one to play with the kitten, feed it, and care for it the most.
 Kittens are naturally social animals, and will mimic the behavior that they see you and other humans modeling for them. Encourage friends and family to treat your kitten gently and play with it, to help it develop an emotional bond and find a healthy outlet for its natural predatory instincts. If you kitten is being overly aggressive in its play, walk away and only resume playing when the kitten has calmed down.Do not encourage your kitten to playfully bite or scratch you. Although the behavior may initially seem cute, once the kitten has grown into an adult cat, its bite can be quite painful.

 The stone should be roughly the same size as the palm of your hand.


In principle, this works similar to the method of using a kitchen knife. The advantage is that you do not have to use a utensil with a sharp blade, and you can use this method when camping or backpacking.
A smooth rock works much better than one with a jagged surface. The more even the surface is, the more evenly the garlic will be crushed.
 Run it through the dishwasher two or three times to make sure that it is thoroughly clean.









If you do not have a dishwasher or do not feel comfortable throwing stones in it, you can clean the rock by washing it in a solution of hot water, soap, and a small amount of bleach. Rinse well and dry well.
 Fold a small sheet of wax paper around the top and bottom of the garlic clove.









This step is only optional, technically speaking, but it does help in keeping the process sanitary since the wax paper prevents the rock from coming into direct contact with the garlic. It also makes it easier to collect the crushed garlic afterward.
 Give the garlic clove a good smack with the stone, just enough to loosen the skin.









Be careful as you do this so that you do not accidentally crush your fingers.
 The skin should peel away easily after the first strike.
 You can crush the garlic further by continuing to strike it or by grinding it.









Crush the garlic by striking it multiple times with the stone.
Place the stone over the garlic clove and "wiggle" it back and forth, applying strong, even pressure.

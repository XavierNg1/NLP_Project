 Don’t raise your voice, call your spouse names, or get sarcastic. Acting nasty will put a stop to any productive discussion you might have had. If you feel your temper rising, call a time-out and regain your composure before continuing the conversation.If you’re getting too angry to talk rationally, go somewhere by yourself and take a few deep breaths, or blow off steam by taking a walk around the block.
 Argue about one thing at a time. Don’t drag unrelated issues or old grudges into the conversation. Leave the past where it belongs – behind you. If you’ve already forgiven your spouse for something, don’t dredge it up again as ammunition for your current argument.For instance, if you’re arguing about how often to mow the lawn, don’t bring up an old disagreement about where your kids should go to school.
 Stay civil and polite. Some things, like name-calling or picking at your spouse’s insecurities, should remain off-limits during an argument. If you’re angry enough that you want to say something to hurt your spouse, step away and cool down by yourself.For example, if your husband makes a rash decision, resist the urge to call him "stupid" or "an idiot." Even if you feel it's true in the moment, it will only make communication and conflict resolution even harder.
 Give your spouse the benefit of the doubt. Don’t put words in their mouth or look for reasons to assume the worst. Make sure you understand what they’re saying before you answer them.For example, your spouse tells you they need some space and you assume they are trying to leave the marriage. Ask for clarification. "Space" could simple mean more time and room to think things over.
If something is bothering you, address it. Don’t spend time by yourself stewing over what may have been an innocent action or remark.

 A book with pages like a bible is a good choice for this purpose. A book printed on rice paper is the best option., The ink may add unwanted chemicals to your smoking experience.
 Cut a small rectangle approximately 2 inches long by 1 ½ inches wide.
 Make a crease in the center of the paper to hold your smoking material in the center of a “V” shape., Place a small amount of crumpled smoking material in the V of the fold.
 Create a rolled cigarette by pinching the paper in the middle and roll it between your fingers.Roll the material towards one end of the paper and wrap the paper around the smoking material.
 Use your saliva as a glue to stick the paper to itself.Seal the ends of the cigarette by twisting the paper gently to keep the smoking material from falling out.
 Breathe in slowly as you light the end to get the paper and smoking material to begin to burn.

 It should be someone you know well and enjoy being around. You should be close to them and you shouldn't find them boring or irritating.;
, If you haven't agreed on the film, you will get bored halfway through it, and lose interest. Try one of the many film review websites out there before you go.
 If you are nervous or it is your first date, you could try putting your hand next to his -if he has his hand on the arm rest- then just shuffle your hand closer to his and you will end up holding hands.
 He may do anything from flinch to take the hint and place his arm around you.
 If it is your first date or you are just nervous about kissing, rest your head on his shoulder and look at him and he will probably end up kissing you! Relax and don't worry about being nervous or not knowing what to do while you are sitting there.
, Firstly, this is really cute because you get to be closer to him, and secondly, you won't disturb the people watching the film!

, Make sure you both like it!

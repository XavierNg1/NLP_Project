Analyze the surface of the sheet metal. If the sheet metal is smooth to the touch, you will need to texturize it before painting.
Create a rough surface on the sheet metal. Using high-grit sandpaper or steel wool, rub the surface of the sheet metal. This will allow the paint to adhere to the metal. Create a light, even texture on the surface and avoid making deep grooves in the metal. To remove stubborn rust spots, use a drill with a circular wire brush attachment.;
, A clean surface will allow the paint to adhere better to the sheet metal and will create a more attractive finish.


Spray the sheet metal with white vinegar and wipe it down with a clean rag. The vinegar's acidity will further abrade the sheet metal.
Spray the metal with compressed air. This will remove any dust and dirt from the surface of the sheet metal.
 If there are areas of the sheet metal that will not be painted, cover them with painter's tape or masking tape.

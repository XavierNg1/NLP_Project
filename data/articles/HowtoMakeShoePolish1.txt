 Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water. Place a heat-safe bowl on top. Bring the water to a simmer over medium heat., You will need about 2.8 ounces (79.38 grams) of olive oil and 1.1 ounce (31.18 grams) of white beeswax.For extra shine, try using half beeswax and half carnauba wax., As the beeswax heats up, it will start to melt. Once it melts completely, give it a stir so that it blends in with the olive oil., Use a coffee grinder or food processor to grind 1Â½ teaspoons of black or brown oxide. Stir the powdered oxide into the melted mixture. Keep stirring until the oxide has blended completely into the mixture, and no streaks, swirls, or specks remain.Remember to clean your coffee grinder or food processor well after this, or you risk contaminating your food.
If you don't have a coffee grinder, you can try using a pestle and mortar. Remember to clean it well!
You should only do this is you want to brighten the color of black or brown shoes. Do not add oxide if your shoes are a different color or they will stain.
 Make sure that the container is large enough to hold all of your shoe polish. Tiny glass jars and candle tins work best. You can also pour it into several smaller containers as well.
 This will take about 45 to 60 minutes. Once it hardens, it is ready to use!If you are in a hurry, let it cool down to room temperature first, then stick it in the fridge or freezer for a couple of minutes, or until it turns solid.
 Wipe your shoes down with a damp cloth first to remove any dirt. Apply the shoe polish with a clean, dry cloth and buff it in well.Wipe off any extra polish with a clean cloth. For extra shine, buff the shoes afterwards with a buffing brush.

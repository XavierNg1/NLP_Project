 If an email or website asks for sensitive personal information, there’s a good chance it may be a scam. In particular, watch out for messages and sites that ask for the following:


Security codes
Debit or credit card details
Bank account numbers
Social security number
Driver’s license or passport numbers
Your mother’s maiden name
Date of birth
Your full name and contact information

, Many scam emails and websites will use the same types of words, phrases, and terminology. You should be suspicious of emails and websites that use the following:


Consistently poor grammar and incorrect spelling
Frequent misuse of words or idiomatic expressions
The phrase “unemployment filing assistance”
The phrase “file for unemployment extensions here”
The phrase “click for filing for unemployment online”

, Filing for unemployment benefits is free, can only be done by the person seeking the benefits, and can only be completed on an official government website or with state-issued paperwork.


Anything or anyone that charges a fee for filing on your behalf or that asks you to fill out non-government online forms is most likely a scam and should be avoided.
 Remember that the only way to file digitally for unemployment benefits is on an official government website.


This means that if a website claims that it will either file for you or that it has the forms you need to file, but it doesn’t end in the .gov extension, it’s likely a scam.
In particular, watch out for websites making these types of claims that end in the following extensions:

.org
.com
.biz

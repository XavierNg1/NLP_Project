The picture will now flip horizontally. The purpose of this step is to flip the image over so that when you iron on your picture, it won't be backwards. When you iron on the picture without flipping it, it will be a mirror image instead of what you see on the computer screen.
 Load your special paper into the feeding tray and make sure to follow all directions! Usually you place the waxy side of the paper as the bottom side, but it depends on what kind of printer you have. Basically, insert the paper so that the printer will print on the waxy side.
, Don't forget it is like the temporary tattoo stickers, in which you place the ink side down so that it touches your shirt. Heat each section of the paper for about 30 seconds using the iron. Note: most t-shirt papers do not need steam, so leave it off. Also, depending on your brand of iron, turn the iron up to its hottest. The paper will stick to the wax if the iron isn't hot enough!

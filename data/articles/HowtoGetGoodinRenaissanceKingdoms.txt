 There should be a welcoming message to send you on your way.;
,, It should not cost more than six to seven pounds and you should not be prepared to pay more - remember, you need to save money to level up!

, Now you will not be hungry anymore, as indicated by the apple in the top right of your screen. Do this every day.
,, It should be a bar with a pick-axe, or something similar. The mine is the best place for a newcomer to work, because you get 8 pounds that day and another 8 pounds on Sundays. If you work in the mine seven days a week, you can make 112 pounds. Enough to eat every day and to level up within the week.
 You can only receive three from other players at level 0. The other two you will need to get from working at the church.
,, You will asked which type of field you want to buy for 90 pounds. The best field for a newbie is a vegetable field.
 Once you buy your field, you are level 1. Now you can harvest your field, eat what you grow and sell the rest on the market. Continue to work in the mine when you can, so that you can afford to eat better meals in the taverns, to get your strength, charisma and intelligence points up.

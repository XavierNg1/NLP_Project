 When voluntary administration is in place, all the old rules change. The company may no longer owe anything to you, dependent on the rules in your jurisdiction. But if the company does announce that it will honor items such as gift vouchers, get there swiftly to redeem them.;
, There may be lots of conditions placed on redeeming gift vouchers, credit, lay-aways, lay-bys or unused services, etc. If the company says it will only honor vouchers to the value of half their worth or will only provide the services to the first 100 customers, heed what you're told and do your best to try to meet the new conditions so that you at least get something back.
 If you are owed a considerable amount, it's a good idea to talk to someone in the store who deals with the financial policies. If that's not possible, talk to someone in the Consumer Affairs department of your government or get legal advice.
 Even if the company trades through its difficulties or is purchased by a new company, the old rules and policies governing the store's running will probably be long gone and that may well include the redemption of vouchers, etc. Keep well informed as to what is happening by reading the store's website and checking updates through social media and local news sources.

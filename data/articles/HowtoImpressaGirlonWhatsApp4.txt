 Show her that you care about her time and that, while you want to talk to her, you don’t want to bother her. Make sure that she’s not getting work done, hanging out with friends, or otherwise occupied.Before you message her, check her status to make sure it doesn’t say that she’s busy.
 If you really like her and want to impress her, you shouldn’t have to pretend to enjoy talking to her. Sincerity goes a long way, and you’ll have a much easier time maintaining a good conversation if you actually want to get to know her.Thoughtful questions, relevant responses to her answers, and specific compliments will help let her know you’re sincere.
For example, if she tells you that she's stressed about having a ton of studying to do, don't change the subject or talk about how much you have on your plate. Instead, say something like, "Well that's no good! Should I let you get to work? Or maybe I could help you study?"

, If you ask her how she’s doing and she says “Not great,” ask her why. Tell her you’d be happy to chat about anything that’s bothering her.She’ll appreciate the fact that you’re willing to let her vent, and you might even be able to impress her by giving her great advice about her problem.
 Even if you think you’re paying her a compliment, you’ll just make her feel disrespected, and there’s nothing more unimpressive than that. Being courteous, polite, and genuine will help you stand out better than anything else.

If the two of you know each other outside of social media or are comfortable enough, you could ask her if she wants to video chat. Just keep it clean, and have a nice, face-to-face conversation.

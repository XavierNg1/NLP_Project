, The school is giving you the opportunity to address the whole student body, the teachers, and maybe even the board of trustees. It’s appropriate and recommended to thank your school for giving you this platform.


For example, "I'd like to thank our school for always making sure that we were prepared for the next step, and refusing to let us fall through the cracks"

, These are your peers, and they’ll be listening and supporting you. Thank them for their friendship and their role in your school experience. They will appreciate it. , Of course!

 It is important to get support from friends and family when you are trying to make a major life change. Make sure that you tell people about your commitment to quit eating junk food and ask for their support. You will be much more likely to be successful if you ask for help than if you try to go it alone.This is also a way to have others hold you accountable. It is much easier to quit when no one is watching.
 You may be reaching for junk food because you tend to eat mindlessly. To change your tendency to reach for junk, try to practice mindful eating habits. Pay attention to the smell, look, and taste of your food. Try to eat slowly and avoid eating while you are distracted or feeling stressed.


Ask yourself some questions before you reach for food. As yourself: 1) am I really hungry or is there a different reason why I want to eat something right now? 2) what do I want to eat? Asking yourself these questions can help prevent you from reaching for junk food or eating something that you do not really want to eat., People are more likely to overeat and reach for junk food after watching fast food or junk food advertisements. Since ads are difficult to avoid while watching TV, teach yourself to see these commercials with a critical eye. Donâ€™t just accept what the ad is telling you.Ask questions about the ad and consider the way the ad presented the food. Was anything exaggerated? If so, what?

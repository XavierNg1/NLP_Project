 After uncorking your wine, snap the aerator pourer into place. Generally, you can do this by simply pushing one end carefully into the top of the wine bottle.You can usually identify which end of the wine aerator pourer snaps into the bottle by looking for a rubber nozzle with a series of rings around it. Push this end into the wine bottle.
You can identify the top of the wine aerator pourer by looking for a metal or plastic spout. Some aerator pourers feature narrow, straw-like extensions protruding from their tops.
 With the aerator pourer in place, position a wine glass on a flat, stable surface. Pour your desired volume of wine into the glass. Pour slowly, as the rate at which your wine comes out with an aerator pourer in place may be different than the rate at which you’re used to it coming out.Some aerator pourers require that you turn the bottle completely upside down in order to pour a glass. Others enable you to pour wine just as you would in the absence of an aerator pourer. If you find that your wine is not coming out of the bottle with the aerator pourer in place, continue tipping the bottle at a steeper angle until it does so., Some aerator pourers come coupled with a wine stopper or feature a twist-top mechanism. This enables you to avoid the hassle of attaching and then removing the aerator pourer each time you wish to have a glass of aerated wine. To use the wine stopper, push the pointed or narrower end into the aerator pourer when you’ve finished drinking.Some aerator pourers have a twist-operated stopper built into them. To use this, simply turn the aerator pourer (or some portion of it). You might have to turn the aerator pourer clockwise or counterclockwise. The wine will then be sealed just as it would be if it were corked.If your aerator pourer does not feature a stopper or twist-top mechanism, pull it out of the bottle and wash it according to manufacturer directions. Seal the bottle using the cork.

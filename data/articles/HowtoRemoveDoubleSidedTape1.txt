 Plug your hairdryer into the nearest power outlet and turn it on to a medium or high setting. Hold the hairdryer a few inches away from the tape and let the hot air blow over it, focusing on the edges and corners. This will cause the glue to soften. After a few minutes, set the hairdryer aside and try to pick at one of the corners of the tape with your fingernail. Most of the tape should come off, but you may need to take the hairdryer to it again.








If you have very short fingernails, or don't want to ruin a nice manicure, then use a butter knife or pallet instead.
If you still have a thin film of residue, you can buff the surface with a scouring pad soaked with warm, soapy water. Avoid using oil or oil-based commercial cleansers.;
, Mix 2 cups (275 milliliters) of water with Â¼ cup (60 milliliters) of vinegar and a few drops of liquid soap. Dip a sponge into this solution, then scrub the affected area on your wall or door using small, circular motions. This cleansing solution is mild and should not remove most paint; however, you might see some fading.
 Dampen the magic eraser with water, and buff the affected area with it until the residue is all gone. Magic erasers are mildly abrasive, which makes them unsuitable for glass and highly-polished surfaces, but they are safe for walls and doors; you may see some mild fading, however.









You can purchase magic erasers in the detergent section of a supermarket or hardware store.

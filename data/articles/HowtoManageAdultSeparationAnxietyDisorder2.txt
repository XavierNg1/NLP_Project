 When you are away from your loved one, take note of any negative thoughts, assumptions, and beliefs that come into your head. Write them down or express them to someone like a therapist or close friend.Knowing what kind of negative thoughts you might expect can help you manage them.


Keeping a daily journal can help you get in the habit of recording your thoughts and feelings., When you have identified these negative thoughts, replace them with positive ones or disprove the beliefs that you feel.Controlling your negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones may help to calm you down.


For example, if your loved one leaves and you think “I may never see her again,” replace that negative thought with a positive one, such as, “I will see her when she gets home from work. We will eat dinner together and watch a movie."
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a treatment plan for depression and/or anxiety that may help you replace negative thoughts with positive ones. Ask your doctor or therapist about beginning treatment.
 When you begin to feel anxious and start thinking negative thoughts, you will only feel more anxious.To keep yourself from dwelling on negative thoughts, distract yourself by:


Engaging in an activity like a hobby you enjoy
Focusing on completing work or household chores
Taking a walk or exercise
Visiting a place you enjoy, such as a museum or the movies

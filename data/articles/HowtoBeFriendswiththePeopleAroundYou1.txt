 These are the people who will be right next to you throughout the whole year, so even if you don't have any classes together, you'll still be able to talk. Start off with a simple 'Hi'. If you say this every time between classes/every time you're at your locker, the other person will become accustomed to you and it may lead to further conversation. After a few days, skip saying 'Hi' and see if they greet you first. If they do, it means they want to be your friend!;
, Don't be afraid to start a conversation. While you're getting your books for your next class, ask them what class they have next, and what teacher. Who knows, their third hour may be the same as your first hour! Now you already have something to talk about. If that is the case, ask about the homework at the end of the day or tell them about the lesson plan before they go to that class.
 If you have the same class, or are heading in the same direction, walk together while talking about something. Good topics are teachers, sports, celebrity gossip, homework, food, fashion, boys/girls, pets, etc! You can even plan hanging out together sometime soon.

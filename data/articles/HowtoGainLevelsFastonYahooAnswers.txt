 Answers once a day. Even if you can only get on for a few minutes, you can still earn lots of points. Logging in gives you one point a day, and those points add up.;
, Answers if you have the time. You don't have to waste away your entire week on Yahoo!, but once or twice a week, make an effort to spend a good amount of time answering questions.
 Don't answer questions on dogs if you don't even own one, or answer a question about dining in Cleveland if you have never visited. The only exception? Use a search engine to research the answer.
 Don't type too much, get to the point, and at the end of your answer, simply say "Hope this helped." The better the answer, the higher chance of getting best answer, which awards you 10 points each.
 The ones that say 'In-Voting' are usually easy wins. Vote 'Best Answer' for yourself and get 1 point, and then if all goes well, receiving best answer gives you 10 points.
 Always use Yahoo! as a last resort for asking questions. Use Yahoo! search engine, Google, search previous questions, and ask friends before you ask a question.
 Polls and Surveys, Adolescents, Music, Celebrity, Jokes & Riddles, Grade-Schooler, and Beauty and Style are usually considered easy sections, most of the questions don't require much effort to research and are mostly common sense or advice.
 You may hit dry patches where you will only earn points and gain levels rarely, but then you will strike gold!

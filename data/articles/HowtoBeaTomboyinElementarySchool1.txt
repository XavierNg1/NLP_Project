 Some tomboys love sports! If you enjoy being active, spend your free time and recesses playing games. You may even want to join an organized sports team. You can try hockey, basketball, volleyball, swimming, running, football, softball, or baseball.;
, Some tomboys prefer video games to sports games. Instead of running around outside or on the court, spend your free time gaming. You can play games by yourself or with a group of friends.


Ask your parents for permission before trying a new game.
 Tomboys play with a variety of toys. Some prefer motorized toys, like remote control cars, dirt bikes, and drones; others like to play with skateboards and BMX bikes.


Also, not all tomboys have to like the same activities. You can be a tomboy that enjoys skateboarding but hates sports., Tomboys are unapologetically active. They don’t shy away from rough and tumble activities. While most girls prefer to sit on the sidelines, tomboys don’t think twice about getting their shoes muddy on the field or ripping a new pair of jeans while climbing a tree.


Be more concerned about having fun than how you look. For example, don’t shy away from a game of tag on picture day.
 Girly-girls and tomboys don’t always have a lot in common. When you’re at school, you may find that you prefer to spend time with boys. Don’t be afraid to spend your recesses racing around the playground with the guys. If you are having fun, that’s all that matters!Instead of going to the mall, spend your Saturday playing video games with the guys.
Instead of ballet, ask your parents to sign you up for baseball.

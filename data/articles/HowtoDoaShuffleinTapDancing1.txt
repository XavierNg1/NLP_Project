 A brush is a simple movement of one foot, letting the ball of your foot brush the ground as you move it in a direction.;
, A shuffle is a combination of two brushes - one going away from your body and one back to it. So, naturally, you'll first brush your right foot forward.
,, Be sure to take it slow at first. Brush forward, brush back, and step.

 Not all herbs will dry well in this manner but some leaves and flowers will dry this way, such as yarrow, fennel and rosemary.
 For example, in a vase/bouquet with other plants being arranged or add to a craft project such as a wreath or a woven plant object.
 Allow to dry as is, but do check on it regularly. If you see signs of mildew or anything else that doesn't look right, remove the herbs.

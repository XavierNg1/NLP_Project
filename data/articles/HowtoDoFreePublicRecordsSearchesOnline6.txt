 In order to find information about a veteran, you will need the individual's full name, service number, branch of service, conflict(s) the veteran served in, date and place of birth, and date of death if he or she is deceased.Many recent military records are not available online due to privacy policies. You can still request paper copies of these to be sent to you, however, by visiting the VetsRec System website., The National Archives has digitized many service records from various conflicts, from the Civil War to WWII to the Vietnam War. It also provides diplomatic records. New records are added regularly as the Archives continues to digitize them.These archives contain many types of records. For instance, the WWII records include enlistment records, prisoner of war records, records about Japanese internment, and personnel records.If you can’t find the actual service records online, you can request copies to be sent to you. These requests are restricted to veterans and immediate next of kin only. You will need to provide information such as the veteran’s name, date and place of birth, social security number, service number, branch of service, and other information., Most service records have been maintained by the federal government since 1790, but most states have also maintained records, especially for conflicts prior to WWII. These archives may be run by various state offices. In New York State, for example, the archive is maintained by the Office of Cultural Education through the New York State Education Department.


Each state's archives will vary, both in terms of the information available and the time periods that have been archived. You may need to visit these locations in person if the documents you’re looking for have not yet been digitized.

 Unfortunately, you can't (yet) shotgun beer out of a bottle; only an aluminum can will work. Tilt the beer can just a little, so that that the bottom is slightly higher than the top.;
, Use a can opener, key, or other sharp object, such as a knife, although you should always be careful with sharp implements. (Obligatory public announcement.) Holding the beer horizontally with the bottom up a bit will mean that there is a small air pocket at the bottom of the can; this means that if you can puncture the hole in the air pocket properly, no beer will shoot out.









Be sure to puncture a big enough hole. Shoot for a hole roughly the size of a quarter. Any smaller and your chugging partners will be cracking open the next brew while you're busy daintily drinking your charge. Remember, shotgunning is about speed as well as enjoyment.
Just in case you miss the air pocket when puncturing the can, it's recommended that you puncture it outdoors or somewhere that can catch the escaping liquid, as Murphy's Law will ensure that on important occasion, beer-worthy or not, there will be a giant mess.
Try to push the sharp edges of the can inside of the can to avoid cuts on your hand and your mouth.
 Then turn the can upright, so that the force of gravity begins to work with you.
 Once the beer is opened on the top, the beer will start running freely through the hole at the bottom of the can.









Why is it that opening the top "forces" the beer down your throat? It's physics! Opening the tab at the top of the can allows air into the top. Increased air means increased pressure forcing the drink down into your welcoming stomach. Any vacuum that might have been created is now less present.Let the beer flow straight down your throat; the more you chug and gulp while shotgunning the beer, the longer it will take.
 Air coming in from the top of the can will allow the beer to gush out of the bottom at a very intense rate. Be prepared and, most of all, enjoy!

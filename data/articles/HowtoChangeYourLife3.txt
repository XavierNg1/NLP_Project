 Exercising regularly not only keeps you looking your best, it will improve your cardiovascular health, reduce your likelihood for certain diseases, give you more energy, and even improve your sex life.Healthy adults need 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity each week.Moderate activities include walking or swimming leisurely, while vigorous activities include jogging, kickboxing, or spinning.
You should do strength training of some kind at least two days per week.Try lifting weights or doing floor work (crunches, push-ups, etc) that use your own body as resistance.
Consider joining a gym or local sports team. Exercising with other people can help keep you motivated, and will make exercise more fun.
 Remember that you are what you eat. Whether you want to lose weight or simply improve your overall health, what you eat matters.


Your diet should consist of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Read food labels and stay away from foods that contain artificial coloring, aspartame, and other chemicals. Eat sugar and empty carbohydrates in moderation.
If you suffer from anxiety or depression, then cut down on alcohol and caffeine, as these substances will make matters worse., Makeovers aren't just about looking better, necessarily. The simple act of getting a haircut or buying different clothes can make you feel like a new person. Whether you're unhappy with your look or simply bored with it, try to mix things up.


Change your wardrobe. Get rid of clothes that make you feel frumpy, sloppy, or otherwise bad about yourself. Make an effort to look your best on a daily basis. This doesn't necessarily mean dressing fancy or formal; rather, find clothes that are figure-flattering, stylish (in your opinion), affordable, and age-appropriate.
Change your hairstyle. Get a haircut or dye your hair a different color. Women with long hair should consider getting layers, bangs, or a short bob.
Men can drastically change their appearance using facial hair. Try getting a beard, moustache, or goatee. If you are a man who has always had facial hair, try shaving it off for a change.

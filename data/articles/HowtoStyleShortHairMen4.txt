 Squeeze a small amount of styling cream into the palm of your hand, then rub your hands together to spread it. Smooth the cream evenly over the entire head of hair.









This style requires the use of lightweight hair products, so you should avoid anything heavier than hair cream. Hair mousse may work instead of cream, but make sure that your hair can still move freely after application.
 Draw a part into one side of your hair using a standard comb.


Position the part to the edge of the crown. It can rest on either the right or left side.
 Set a blow dryer to low speed and begin drying your hair. As you operate the dryer, use the fingers of your free hand to position your locks.









Starting at the part, work the hair at the top of your head in the direction opposite the part. Continue over the entire crown and toward the side of your head.
Guide the hair at the other side of your part in the opposite direction, pushing the sides straight down.
 If desired, use a flexible defining paste to help hold the style in place.









Work a small amount of paste over both hands, then smooth the paste onto your hair in the direction of the style.
If you have fine hair, skip the paste and apply a light mist of hairspray, instead.

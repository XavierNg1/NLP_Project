 The full name of the model you need is the IR Spin Control Beyblade Extreme Top System (XTS) by Hasbro. There are nine different Beyblades in the IR Spin Control series to choose from., As it says on the box, the Beyblade itself comes with batteries in it, but the controller doesn't. You'll need two AAA batteries and a small Phillips head screwdriver.Unscrew the screws on the handle of the controller with a screwdriver.
Put the batteries in and then screw the screws back in. Avoid screwing them in too tight as the metal screws can strip the plastic threads.
 There's a switch on the Beyblade and a switch on the controller. These determine the frequencies that they operate on and they need to match, so switch both the Beyblade and the controller to either the first or second position.

 This can make all the difference in winning. Thinking rationally, even for a few seconds, will help you to remain calm so that you can fight with your mind as well as your body.


Determine whether your opponent seems to be angry (at you or just in general), looking for a fight, mentally ill, or drunk. This information can help you decide the best way to quickly end the fight.Before you decide how to fight (or flee), evaluate your opponent's size and strength. Keep in mind the old adage that "The good big man beats the good little man." This doesn't mean that you can't win a fight against an opponent who is larger and stronger than you, but it does mean that you should take these factors into account.;
, If your opponent is yelling, threatening you, or throwing things, but has not yet attacked you physically, you may be able to de-escalate the situation and avoid a fight altogether.You must remain calm yourself. Responding to anger with anger will only make the situation worse.
Tell your opponent you want to hear what he has to say. Listen carefully. If your opponent is in pain or upset, listening quietly may calm them down.
 If your opponent is acting irrationally and unpredictably - such as someone who is drunk or mentally ill - it will be more difficult to de-escalate, but it can be done.An opponent who is impaired might not really want to fight you once he's calmed down. This may influence your decision about whether to fight or to try to de-escalate the situation.
To try to help someone who is impaired to calm down, listen to the person, agree with whatever he says, and then tell him what you want him to do (e.g. sit down, leave). The key is to repeat the loop as many times as it takes - even a dozen times. This technique fails if you give up too soon.

 The frets seven and twelve tend to be the frets most easily used with this technique, so we will start there. Choose either.;
, Note that you are in fact over the fret itself and note placing your finger where you would hold the string down as if normally fretting it.
 Adjust your fret hands pressure and placement until you have a satisfying harmonic note.
 Now that you have found the placement that gives you the strongest and clearest harmonic over the fret, practice releasing your finger from the string as quickly as possible after picking it to let the harmonic ring out. You're done!

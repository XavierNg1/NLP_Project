 Many cooks maintain that keeping the shell on the shrimp during cooking enhances the flavor, since the shell keeps juices in and is itself packed with flavor. However, some people like to peel the shrimp before cooking, so it's easier to eat the finished dish.





If you want to keep the shell on the body while you're cooking it, but you'd rather not cook it with the legs and vein, use a pair of kitchen scissors to snip the shell along its back. This way you can still devein the shrimp, and peel off the shell when it's done cooking.;
, Sometimes shrimp comes with the head still attached. That's the first thing you should pull off. You can also chop if off if you'd rather.
 Grasp them between your fingers and pull them off in clumps. They should easily detach from the body.
 Start at the head end slip your fingers under the shell. Gently pull it away from the body in one piece.
 Some cooks like the way the tails look in the finished dish, while others prefer to remove it.
 Put them in a bag and freeze them for when you want to make shrimp stock. It's a delicious base for shrimp bisque and other seafood soups.

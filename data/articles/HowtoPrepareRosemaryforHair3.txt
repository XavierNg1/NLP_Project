 Mix 1/4 cup of tea with 1 cup of liquid castile soap.


Add a few drops of camphor oil immediately before you shampoo if you have dandruff.
Squeeze in a small amount of lemon juice for oily hair. A few drops of lavender essential oil creates a soothing fragrance.



Pour the liquid slowly through your hair immediately after you shampoo, and then rinse your hair with warm water.



Dip a cotton ball into the tonic, and then dab the tonic onto your scalp.
Put on a plastic shower cap and leave the tonic on your scalp for 30 minutes, and then rinse.

 First, simply write y = mx + b. You can fill the equation in once you have enough information. Let's say that you're trying to solve the following problem: Find the equation of a line that has a slope of 4 and passes through the point (-1, -6)., Use what you know: that "m" is equal to the slope, which is 4, and that "y" and "x" represent the given "x" and "y" coordinates which are known, in this case. We have "x" = -1 and "y" = -6. "b" represents the y-intercept; you do not know b yet, so you can leave the "b" term in place. Here's how the equation will look once you plug in the relevant information:


y = -6, m = 4, x = -1 (the given values)
y = mx + b (the formula)
-6 = (4)(-1) + b (by substitution)

, Now, simply do the math to find "b," the y-intercept. Just multiply 4 and -1 and then subtract the result from -6. Here's how you do it:


-6 = (4)(-1) + b
-6 = -4 + b (by multiplying)
-6 - (-4) = -4 -(-4) + b (by subtraction)
-6 - (-4) = b (simplifying the right hand side)
-2 = b (simplifying the left hand side)

, Now that you've solved for "b," you can fill in all of the necessary information and finish writing the line in slope intercept form. All you need to know is the slope and the y-intercept:


m = 4, b = -2
y = mx + b
y = 4x -2 (by substitution)

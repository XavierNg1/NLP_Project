 You only need to put the thin side in your mouth, but be very careful. Moistening both ends will stop the reed from warping (bending). Also make sure not to cut your mouth as reeds sometimes have sharp edges, especially new ones.;
, Make sure the hook is hanging at the front.
 You can get this at a music store, they look like tubes of chapstick.
 Take the reed out of your mouth and place its flat side on the flat part of the mouthpiece. The thin, curved end of the reed should line up with the thin end of the mouthpiece. Leave a small amount of room in between.
 Make sure that the wider end of the ligature slides on first to match the shape of the mouthpiece. The screws should be on the thick bottom part of the reed, facing you. Tighten the ligature.
 If it's difficult to slide on, do not add cork grease. This a problem amongst beginners, the grease will act as glue and make small particles stick to it and when the neck goes on the body and the neck is twisted, the particles may act like sandpaper and do more damage. The best way is to use a bit of tissue and clean both contact points until they are dry and dust free. The neck should go on very easily.
 Picking up your horn by the upper body can cause damage to the mechanisms that make your horn work properly.



Do not force the neck on and be careful to not damage the octave key (on body or neck) when assembling.
 The last step is to have fun playing!! And remember practice makes perfect!

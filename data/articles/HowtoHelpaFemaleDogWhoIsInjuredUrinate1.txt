 Helping her go to the bathroom will take some commitment on your part. However, just remember that squatting places a strain on bones and muscles, and if one of those bones or muscles is not able to support the dog's weight she is liable to collapse. This will discourage her from trying to urinate again, and she may lie in her bed and soil herself.;
, A hand towel is fine for a small dog, a bath towel for a medium dog, and a bath sheet for a large dog. Alternatively, improvise with anything that is long and narrow, but if using a belt or similar, just be careful it doesn't dig into her skin or chaff in any way.A simple sling can be made from a cotton shopper bag. Slit the side seams so that the bag lies out completely flat. The body of the bag forms the sling which you locate under the belly, then bring the handles together, one on either side, to hold them above her back to form a hoist.
 Hold one end above her back, pass the other end under her belly and up the other side, and grasp the two ends together above her back. This forms a loop with the dog supported in the 'U' of the loop. Slide the sling back so that it rests as far back towards her hips and knees as is comfortable for her. By holding the ends of the towel you can take the weight off her back legs if she's struggling to walk to a toilet spot.
 As she squats, allow her to assume the squat position but take some of her weight so that she is supported and doesn't tumble if her legs give way. Simply supporting her in a squatting position so that she doesn't collapse can make a big difference to her.

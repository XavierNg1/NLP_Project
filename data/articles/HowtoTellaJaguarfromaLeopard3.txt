 While physical and behavioral characteristics are the easiest ways to distinguish between a jaguar and a leopard, you can also identify the animal by its geographic location. These two big cats naturally live on opposite sides of the world, though of course some individuals may be kept in captivity in other regions.Jaguars live exclusively in North America, Central America, and South America, and may not be able to survive in a leopard's habitat.
Leopards live in African and Asian countries, and may not be able to survive in a jaguar's habitat.
 In addition to geographic location, it may also be helpful to know the animal's preferred environment. Jaguars are somewhat diverse in their habitat selection, though they typically inhabit rain forests, flooded wetlands, swamps, and dry grasslands., Though they live on different sides of the world, leopards and jaguars often reside in similar habitats. Leopards can inhabit a broad range of habitats, including woodlands, grasslands, mountains, deserts, and rainforests. The specific habitat a leopard inhabits depends largely on which continent it resides in.

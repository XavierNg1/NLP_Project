 Wash out the inside of the can with soap and water. Remove any leftover liquid from the can. You can check and wash the can again after you cut it open.
 The part of the can you want to save is the flat middle. To cut the can, take craft scissors designed to be used on tin. You can also make a cut with an x-acto knife and then cut around the can.


Be careful of sharp edges.
 Find the seam on the middle portion of the can. This is where the metal was soldered together to create the canâ€™s shape. In a soda can, it will often be by the ingredient section on the label. Once you have found it, cut down it through the length of the can. Unroll this portion and flatten it against a surface., The tiles can be found for cheap at a home improvement store. The size you need depends on the size of your coasters, but four by four inches (10.16 cm) is a standard size. A good glue, such as a silicone glue, can be bought at any craft store. Rub the glue over the back of the metal, then press the metal flat over the top of the tile. Let the glue settle overnight.
 The next day, use a brush to apply varnish over the metal to protect it. Dip the brush into the varnish and spread an even coating over the top of the coaster. This prevents the metal from peeling after use. Another option for this is to stitch or glue fabric over the edges of the metal., Find packs of small felt pads at the craft store. Peel them off from their protective backing and attach the sticky side to the bottom of the tile. The felt will protect your table from scratches.

 For a twist, consider adding a pinch of cinnamon or a granule of instant coffee., Make sure that there are no lumps or clumps. If there are any, use your fork to break them up.
 If you'd like a vegan option, use water instead.You can also try using another type of milk, such as soy. If you are not a fan of vanilla and would like something more bitter, try coffee extract instead., Be careful not to over-mix, however. If you over-mix, your brownie will turn out too rubbery., How long you cook your brownie will depend on how strong your microwave is. A 1000 watt microwave will cook a brownie in abut 1 minute and 40 seconds.When cooked, there will be no liquid left. The brownie will still look a little moist, however. You do not need to cover the mug when cooking it.


If you don't know how strong your microwave is, start at 1 minute, then cook at 30-second intervals until fully cooked.
 Take it out of the microwave using an oven mitt, and set it down on a stable surface until it cools down enough to eat. As it cools, it will also finish cooking inside.
 You can eat it as is, straight out of the mug, or you can add some goodies, such as a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, or a drizzle of hot fudge. If you are a fan of coffee, you might like a scoop of coffee ice cream on yours.

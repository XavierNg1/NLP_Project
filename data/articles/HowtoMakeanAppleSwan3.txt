The cut can be about 3/4-inch (1.905 cm)deep., Set two knives next to the other half of your apple and make a full horizontal cut through the bottom of the apple.

 Take the apple seeds that you set aside and put them into where the eyes should go on your swan's head. Use a butter knife to press them into the pulp of the apple, so they stick., Take the swan head that you created and place it into the rectangular slot that you made earlier. If you're having trouble keeping the swan's head in the notch that you cut out, you may have to cut a little bit deeper to accommodate the size of the neck.

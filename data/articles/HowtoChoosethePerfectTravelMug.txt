 Even though stainless steel initially costs more, it will give you much better value for your money. You can expect superior performance from a stainless steel travel mug, keeping your coffee or tea hot for about an hour.;
, Plastic liners over time will absorb coffee or tea, making your beverage taste bad. They also break easily if dropped.
 If you don't have a cup holder or don't like to use one, look for a travel mug with a wide non-slip bottom.
 The lids that snap on can sometimes come off if the travel mug tips over or is dropped. Screw on lids are better because they stay on no matter what happens and that's the idea of a travel mug to begin with.
 If you only drink a small amount, consider a smaller 8 oz. travel mug because it's easier to handle. On the other hand, if you want a large amount of coffee or tea to drink, consider a larger 16 or 20 oz. travel mug.

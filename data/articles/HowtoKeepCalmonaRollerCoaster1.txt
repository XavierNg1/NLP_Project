 Breathe slowly and deeply and try to think positively, once you have done this it will all be worth it!;
, For example:


"It's not as bad as it looks. They have safety harnesses and the tracks are tested all the time to ensure they're safe. The restraints 'fail-safe' which means that the default position is locked, it takes more effort to open them! Perhaps even look up the statistics of injury on a rollercoaster, you will find that you are more likely to be struck by lightning of get hurt in a car accident! "
"People scream because it's exciting scary, not bad scary."
"It's only for a short time. Then I'll probably want to get back on and have another go because it's over so quickly, even if the worst case scenario happens and you hate it, it will only last for about 2 1/2 minutes. Then you have conquered it!"

, Tell yourself: "Well, I've made it now, it's going to be all right now that I'm on here." or "I've finally done it."

, This can help a lot to keep you calm and to have reassuring feedback from a person who is used to the rollercoaster or is able to deal with fears better.


Be careful not to choose someone as afraid as you. This can turn into a situation where you feed off each others fear and make things seem a whole lot worse!

 Shampoo and condition your hair as usual to prepare it for the wavy, tousled look. Use products that add body and volume to your hair, rather than shampoo and conditioner designed for straightening hair. Pat the moisture from your hair with a towel when you're finished., For this look, it's best if you use a diffuser. This device diffuses the flow of hot air so that it preserves your hair's natural curls and waves. If you don't have a diffuser, use a the lowest heat setting on your hair dryer to thoroughly dry your hair., Salt-based sprays work well for this purpose - they give layers of hair a "piecey," textured look. If you don't have texturizing spray, you can make your own by mixing salt and water. Spray it all over your hair and use your fingers to scrunch the tips., Rub a small amount of pomade between your hands, then run your hands through your hair. Smooth the top of your hair forward from back to front, then sweep your bangs to one side of the other. Smooth it down in the back and on the sides.

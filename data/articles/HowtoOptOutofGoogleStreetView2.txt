 Locate the Google Map app icon on your homescreen or app drawer, and tap it to open.
 You can use the location button on the header toolbar to set the map to your current location or you can use the search box beside it to find another place on the map.


Finding your current location—Tap the compass button on the header toolbar. The map will adjust based on your current location. Your current location will be identified by a blue dot on the map.
Finding another location—Use the search box and type in the location you want. A shortlist of possible results will drop down. Tap the location you want, and the map will automatically draw to the location you’ve set. A red pin will drop to identify it.
 Put two fingers together on the screen, then move them apart to zoom in to the area you want to get a Street View of.
 Once the map view is of the exact location, tap the red pin. A thumbnail of the Street View will pop up. Tap this to call up the Street View.
 Tap the Street View so that the three-dot menu icon will appear. Tap the icon, and from the options, select “Report a problem.” The “Report Inappropriate Street View” window will appear, and the Street View image you’ve last visited will be included in the report.
 Fill up the form with the required information. Be as detailed as you need to be to indicate which part or parts of the image you want to be blurred and for what reason. You can indicate that you want your face, your car, your house, or another object blurred. Tap the “Send” button on the lower right corner of the window to submit the report to Google.

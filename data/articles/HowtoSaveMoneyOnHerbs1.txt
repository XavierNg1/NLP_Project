 Seeds cost less than fresh herbs and herb plants.


Plant your favorite herbs in your garden, a container or a small pot. If you have no outdoor space, start a windowsill garden or a kitchen herb garden with just a very small investment.;
, You can probably find locally grown herbs for less money at farmer's markets and produce stands.
 Whether you want to buy fresh herbs, herb plants or seeds to grow, shopping online can offer you a larger selection and more competitive prices.


Look for sites that provide free or discounted shipping. You do not want to spend the money you are saving on the herbs on large shipping charges.
Buy other products such as herbal supplements and teas online as well.
 If you prefer fresh herbs over dried but you know you will not use an entire package or plant, swap with other people.


Make a trade. For example, if you buy a package of fresh rosemary stems and your neighbor buys a basil plant, give half of your rosemary in exchange for a few leaves of basil so that you do not buy more than you will use.



Trim the stems and place the herbs in a glass of water. Change the water every 1 or 2 days.
Wrap your fresh herbs in a moist paper towel and place them in a plastic bag that you can seal. Store them in the refrigerator and they will stay fresh for several days.

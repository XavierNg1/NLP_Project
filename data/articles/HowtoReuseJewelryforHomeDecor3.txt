 If you have jewelry that's shattered or broken, you do not have to throw it away. You can glue pieces of, say, a shattered brooch or pendant on a plain Christmas ornament, like a plain white bulb. This adds some glimmer to an otherwise dull ornament you can then hang on your tree., Old brooches and large pendants work best here. You can simply use superglue or industrial strength glue to secure these items to doorknobs in your home. This gives doorknobs a little extra beauty.Smaller pieces, like bits of earrings, can be glued to tiny knobs, like the knobs of cabinets in your kitchen or bathroom.
 If you have any white lampshades in your home, they can look a little dull. You can embellish them by pinning old brooches onto them. If you have lots of brooches, but no white lampshades, lampshades are cheap to buy at most department stores., You can wrap old bracelets around candle holders. You can also glue together a stack of similarly sized bracelets and slip them over existing candleholders. This can spruce up plain glass candleholders in your home.

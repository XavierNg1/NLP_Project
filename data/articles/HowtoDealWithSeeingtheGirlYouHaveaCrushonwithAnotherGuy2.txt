 Unfortunately, her social media will probably involve lots of pictures and posts of her with someone else. Stop following her Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr accounts. You don’t have to unfriend her on Facebook – she will probably notice this and it could make your friendship awkward. Instead, use Facebook’s privacy settings to block her updates from showing up in your feed.


Having to deal with her presence constantly online will make the situation so much harder for you.
Unfollowing her on social media will help you think about her less and keep you from obsessing over what she’s doing.
 This doesn’t have to be a permanent thing, and you should never feel like a place is “off-limits” to you because of another person. However, you’ll probably feel better if you avoid her known hang-outs for a short time, at least at first.


“Out of sight, out of mind” is an old cliché that can be very useful when you’re trying to get over a crush.
You’ll make it harder on yourself to get past the situation if it’s in your face all the time.
 You might not feel like being around people and it may seem preferable to be alone in your room. Make an effort to focus on your school work or find a new hobby that will keep you actively thinking about other things. Look for activities that will get you out of the house and around other people.


It might take a little extra energy to focus on something other than your crush, but you can do it.
Trying out new hobbies and making plans with your friends can help you keep your mind distracted.

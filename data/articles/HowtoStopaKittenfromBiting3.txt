 Redirected aggression is responsible for half the attacks by cats on people. It occurs in kittens when they get frustrated. When a kitten becomes aroused to the point of attack but cannot to do anything about it so she redirects her pent up emotion to the next closest thing. Often this is the person who disturbs her, and she lashes out and bites.


For example, if your cat sees a bird out the window but can’t attack because there is a window pane in the way, she may redirect her anger to the next thing that moves or disturbs her, like your foot.
 When you recognize signs of agitation, you should also try to redirect your kitten’s frustration towards a toy. Once that pent up frustration is channeled in a more appropriate direction, she will become her friendly kitten self once more.


Toss your kitten a catnip mouse or get her chasing a toy on a string.
 The key to remaining bite-free is to put some distance between yourself and your kitten when you notice her becoming agitated, frustrated, or scared. Signs that you cat is agitated and may bite include:


Flattening ears.
A flicking tail.
Skin twitches.
Wide, staring eyes.
Fluffed up coat.
Vocalizing low growls.

 Figure out whether there's a certain skill you lack, and if so, focus on improving that skill or working around it. For example, if you can't head the ball, work with your coach to improve, or get good enough at trapping the ball with your chest or knees so that you don't have to head it.


Age might be a factor. This is because young players are not as experienced as their older counterparts as they haven't played many games as yet.;
, Your playing time might be determined by the position you play. Generally, substitute defenders and goalkeepers lack playtime. An experienced defender or a dominant goalie is difficult to displace. If there's someone on your team who is better than you at your position, become a better player than them to win playing time. Or consider trying out a different position that has less competition on your team - if you become good at this position, it might be easier for you to get more playing time.
 Are you good enough? Can you fit in the team? Can your teammates rely on you? If not, then you don't deserve first team play. Work to improve your playing before you worry about becoming a starter.

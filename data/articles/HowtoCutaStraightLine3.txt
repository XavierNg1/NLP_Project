 All you need for this technique are scissors or a craft knife, paper, and your hands. This technique works best with stiffer paper that will hold a sharp crease.
 Place the paper onto a hard surface and press firmly along the fold. The crease needs to be very sharp to provide the best guide for your scissors.
 Hinge on the fold line so that you are folding the paper in the same spot. Press the paper firmly along the fold again.
 You can use scissors or a craft knife to cut along the fold line. Move carefully so that you stay in line with the fold.

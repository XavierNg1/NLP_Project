 Remove pine needles, sap and any debris that may be present in each cone to be transformed. Place a worksheet under your work area, to protect the work surface.
 Get a clean paintbrush and some glue. Screw the top off the glue and dip the paintbrush into it. Paint the tips of the pine cone with the glue on the end of the paintbrush.
 With the pine cones sitting on newspaper or a paper plate, shake or sprinkle the glitter over the glued areas of the pine cones. Excess glitter can be reused by picking up the paper or plate and reusing or returning to the glitter container.


You can use multiple colors or just one. Either way is effective.
 Leave the cones to dry on newspaper or paper plates overnight.
 Attach a ribbon to the top of each glittered pine cone. They are now ready to be used as Christmas or holiday season decorations.

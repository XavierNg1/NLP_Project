 Make sure that while you are collecting rings not to hit or get too close to Silver. He'll pick up Sonic, causing him to lose all rings.;
, When you hear the sound "Urrghhh!!!" coming from Silver, run and then Homing Attack him. You can also simply move toward him the moment you see he has the table, barrels, or other projectiles in the air and immediately attack him without waiting for a sound cue. Make sure not to repeatedly hit him with it. After hitting, run away before he picks you up.
 You need to carefully use the rings surrounding the boss battle. If you collect every one, the first time he picks you up and throws you, you will not die. But if you save some, you'll take the risk of being picked-up but also still have more rings to last.
 After their battle, you will be introduced to a cut-scene in which Sonic is about to die from Silver's last attack but Amy protects Sonic from any harm from Silver. Then she lets him run away. You will now have unlocked Silver.

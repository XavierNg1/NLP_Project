 You'll want to decide what style of curtain is right for you, if you have not yet purchased your curtains and curtain rods. There are a number of styles, each giving your room a different flavor and functioning in a slightly different way. Some of your options include:

Drapes are typically made from heavy material and are pleated, which requires a traverse rod. To hang, you must place drapery pins in the pleat, and then hang them on the rod. A cord allows you to pull the drapes open and closed.
Panel curtains, eyelet curtains and tab top curtains are meant to hang from a plain round rod. They may have a pocket along the top to push the rod through, or the rod may be threaded through eyelets or tabs. Panel curtains may end at the top or bottom of the windowsill, extend to the floor, or be even longer—a style known as puddling.
Cafe curtains cover only the bottom half of a window, to let light into the room while affording some privacy. They are popular on kitchen windows and are typically hung on rods installed inside the window frame on tension rods.
Door panels have pockets on the top and bottom and require 2 curtain rods, which you install on a door or simply attach with magnets. Door panels are often used on french doors and sidelights.;
, When buying curtains, keep in mind that their length should cover the entire window (unless they are cafe curtains). If you buy tab top curtains, make sure the curtain length doesn't include the length of the tabs.

Floor length curtains end 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from the floor unless you live in a humid environment, in which case they should end 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the floor, because they will stretch more on humid days. If you plan to puddle your curtains, you only need to ensure you have plenty of material left over for the puddle.
Curtains that hang below the sill should extend 4 inches (10 cm) below the sill, long enough to cover the edge of the casing below the window.
Sill-length curtains should skim the sill.
 If you'd like to pull them completely away from the window, buy a longer rod or a rod that has a return (a 90-degree turn on each end that allows you to push the curtain around the turn or rest against the wall). The length of the return should depend on the type and width of the curtain.

, Installing in the casing will always leave at least part of the window obscured, while installing outside the casing allows you to pull the curtains back completely. Which you choose will partially be determined by the style and look you want, but you may also have to account for the material of the wall or casing. If you have plastic window casing, the curtain rods will need to be installed on the wall. If you have plaster, cob, or stone walls, then the casing may be easier.

Bear in mind that the curtain will only draw back as far as the brackets holding the curtain rod, whether or not you have a return, and the style of the curtain will determine how much they can be compressed. The amount you can compress a curtain is called the stack back.
You may want to keep part of the window covered even when the curtains are open, or you may prefer to completely expose the window to let as much light into the room as possible.
 Use a measuring tape. Determine where the top of the curtain will be from where you want the curtain to end: at the sill, below the sill or on the floor. Bear in mind that some styles of curtains have ruffles or pleats that extend above the top of the rod; subtract this section from the measurement. Mark this point on both sides of casing or wall with a pencil. Use a laser level to make sure your marks are even.

, When you're sure of all your measurements, use a pencil to mark where the screws will go. Be careful not to get too close to the edge if installing in the casing, as this will make the material too fragile and cause the wood to crack.

, Consider the length of the rod when hanging the brackets. Though most curtain rods are adjustable, you don't want the distance between the brackets to be so wide that the rod sags in the middle. In general, you shouldn't increase the length of the expanded  rod by more than 50 percent.

, This can keep the screws from cracking the casing or wall material. If installing the brackets on the wall, make sure your pilot holes are big enough to place the screw anchors into, if you need to use screw anchors.

Screw anchors are only necessary if the rod brackets are spaced in such a way that they cannot be attached to the wall studs. If you want to avoid using screw anchors, make sure that your brackets are spaced to go just 1-2" beyond the casing.
 If installing them on the wall between studs, you need plastic screw anchors. These will expand inside the dry wall panel to the weight of the rod and curtains and will prevent the screws from pulling out of the wall. Otherwise, you can simply use the manufacturer included or suggested mounting screws.

, Fit the rod onto the brackets and then use a carpenter's level to make sure that the rod is even. It should be, as long as you measured for level when marking the locations for brackets.

, Remove the rod again and put the curtain on the rod. Hang the rod on the brackets. Now you're done! Good job!

If hanging tab top curtains, a thin rod is best. A thick rod will draw the curtain up, making it hang too high.

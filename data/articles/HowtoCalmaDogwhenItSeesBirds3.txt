 Dogs are naturally vocal animals and, if they hear you loudly vocalizing back at them, they’ll feel stimulated and continue barking and running at the birds. Even if you take an angry tone with your dog, or yell “No!” or other loud commands, your dog will interpret your shouting as a reward.Dogs feed off of your own excitement, and appreciate the attention you’re giving them (even if it’s negative attention).
 Wait until your dog’s excitement over the birds has passed (the birds have flown away or your dog has lost interest). Then, wait about five minutes, and pet and praise your dog. Over time, your dog will come to understand that you praise them for their silence and good behavior.The same principle applies when you’re out on a walk with your dog, although it can be harder to implement. If your dog barks at or chases birds while you’re walking, do not yell at or discipline your dog, but keep it close to your side (don’t let the dog run). Then, once the dog has quieted down, praise the dog and give it a treat. This will positively reinforce its quiet behavior., Rather than shouting at a dog that is barking at or running after birds, simply bring it indoors. Wait until the dog has calmed down sufficiently (try waiting 10 minutes), and let the dog out again only once it is quiet.Even if there are still birds outside, your dog will eventually that learn that, in order to be left outside, it needs to remain well behaved.
 Dogs can be slow to learn and may have a strong drive to chase and bark at birds, especially if the dog is of a hunting breed. Whether you’re at your home or out on a walk, continue to reinforce quiet, calm behavior. Bring your dog back inside (or back from the walk) as often as needed for it to change its behavior and remain calm around birds.Although at first it may be inconvenient to bring your dog inside the house every time it barks at or chases birds, it will reinforce the behavior and help your dog to remain quiet around birds.

 If you bought your fish from a pet store, it is likely to be small and young. Pet stores may not have given the fish adequate nutrition or space as a young fry, meaning that its growth will be stunted for life. You will also be uncertain of the fish’s pedigree; a fish typically only grows as large as its parents. If you want to ensure that your fish reaches its full size or sexual maturity, you should try to buy your goldfish from a breeder., Your goldfish’s growth may be stunted if it does not have a proper tank. This means that your goldfish may not reach sexual maturity, nor will it reach its full adult size. It is not necessarily the size that does the damage, but the build up of waste matter in a confined bowl of water. Low oxygen levels in small bowls can also affect your fish's growth.A single common Goldfish should be kept in at least 48 gallons (181.7 L) of water. Add 14 gallons (53.0 L) per each additional fish. A single fancy Goldfish can be kept in 36 gallons (136.3 L) with 12 gallons (45.4 L) per each additional fish., The water temperature should be between 60 degrees F (15 C) up to the mid 70s (23 C). This is particularly important if you want your fish to reach sexual maturity.Poor water conditions are the primary reason why some goldfish have stunted growth and die young.You should replace about 20% of the tank’s water every two weeks to keep the water clean.A filter in your aquarium will make sure that the water is clean and properly oxygenated.

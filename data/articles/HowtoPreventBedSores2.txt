 Once bed sores have been identified, they should be watched for signs of infection. This includes fever, areas of redness along the border of the ulcer sore, drainage of pus, and a soft texture beneath the skin indicating that the tissue beneath is likely filled with pus or rotting away., Once infection in identified, ask the patient's doctor for appropriate treatment methods. Typically, the doctor will advise tight gauze moistened with normal saline. The gauze should be removed one to two times daily. This action removes dead skin, which allows healthy tissue to form and the wound to heal. Depending on the size of the ulcer, healing will take around four to six weeks.


Dry gauze should be packed on top of it. The skin around the sores should not be wet like the wound.The type of dressing will depend on the size and depth of the of the wound and the amount of drainage.Talk to the doctor about the best dressing and technique to use for the particular patient.
 Never use hydrogen peroxide or betadine on bed sores to clean the healing skin. Instead, always use mild soap and warm water to clean the wound. If that is not possible, use a mild no-wash cleanser to clean the area.The doctor may order an enzymatic or chemical dead skin removal solution to facilitate healing. The removal of the dead skin through surgical means can be necessary in many cases if there is a lot of dead tissue.Other methods for cleaning bed sores include enzymatic agents, maggots, or high-pressure water jets., If there is infection that sets into the sores, a systemic antibiotics might be prescribed. This will help heal the infection and the skin as well. Intravenous antibiotics may be necessary if a bone infection is present, which is not uncommon in bed sores on the pelvic region.

 In a sore neck situation, many things can be done to prevent a sore neck. Before going to sleep, stretching your neck in moderate levels is recommended to help relieve tension and stress and restore range of motion.
 Pillows are a big factor in neck soreness. Pillows can cause a good sleeping position for neck but can also irritate the neck muscles and cause pain. Feather pillows and memory foam pillows can prevent neck soreness by conforming to your head and neck. Try avoiding stiff, high, and/or old pillows as well.
 Mattresses could also be a factor for morning ache. Just as a pillow, an old, stiff mattress could cause pain all over the body. Mattresses should be changed over a few years and mattresses should meet personal needs. Memory foam mattresses are also known to comfort to your body such as memory foamed pillows and provide safe sleeping positions.
 Avoid hunching your neck and carrying heavy objects around your neck and shoulder areas such as backpacks.
 Sleeping on your stomach can be tough on your spine due to the neck being turned to the side. Trying to start the night sleeping on your back or side in a well-supported, healthyÂ position is the recommended positions to reduce the risk of morning pain.

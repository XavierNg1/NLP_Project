 Oil based enamels are most easily used with a compressed air sprayer, but acrylics and latex paints can also be sprayed. Adding a suitable thinner will allow more viscous paint to flow freely through the siphon tube, metering valve (fluid) assembly, and nozzle.;
, Place a drop cloth, sheet plastic, scrap lumber or other material on the ground, floor, or any furniture. For "fixed" projects, like the one illustrated here, you will need to protect adjacent surfaces and make sure you have adequate ventilation.


Protect nearby surfaces from "over spray" with masking or painter's tape and painter's paper or newspapers; in windy, outdoor conditions, airborne paint particles may drift farther than you expect.
Set your paint and thinner on a suitable surface so that spills will not damage anything.
 These will keep you clean and protect you from dangerous fumes and particulates.
 Grind, brush, or sand off rust and corrosion from metal, remove all oil, dust, or dirt, and make sure it is dry. Wash the surface: for oil-based paints, use mineral spirits; for latex or acrylic paints, use soap and water. Rinse thoroughly.
 You can use the sprayer to apply the primer (following the steps below as if it were paint) or apply it with a brush or roller. When youâ€™re done, sand it smooth if needed.

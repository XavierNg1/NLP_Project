 Because you are writing a combination resume, there is no strict format guidelines or boundaries which you need to follow. Multiple people will have very different looking combination resume, so focus on what you're good at. In addition to your work and education experience, you can choose to include skills, awards and achievements, volunteer history, and special qualifications.
 This can be done in one of two ways. If your work history includes positions in more than one field, you should list your jobs under functional sub-headings, which categorize the skills you used at each particular one. If you can demonstrate that your evolving work history highlights the key skills you want to promote, you may want to list your work history in chronological order, without including any sub-headings.


Be sure to provide the general information for each employer/position including the name of the company, location, your title, your duties, and the dates that you worked there.
 The details you include about your education will be the same as the details you’d include in other resume styles; the difference is in where you present the information on the resume. For each college, university, or trade school you have attended, list the name and location of the institution, the degree or certificate you received, and the years you attended.


If your grade point average (“GPA”) was 3.5 or higher, you may want to list it as well.
 After you've made note of your education and work history, give a list of any other information you feel like might be helpful for your employer to have. Choose to include any of the additional sections such as special qualifications, skills, awards and achievements, or volunteer service.
 Include 2-4 professional references (not family or friends)along with their contact information. Be sure to include their name, your relationship to them, and their email, address, and phone number.

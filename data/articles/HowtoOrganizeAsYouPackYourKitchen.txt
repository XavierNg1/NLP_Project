 Try categories like food items, china & breakables, cleaning supplies, electronics, Tupperware, glasses & dishes, and cooking supplies. You can even have a pile for donations as well. If your items are already organized you can skip this step!;
, Pack these items together in a box and do not close the top until the day of the move. These will come in handy until moving day. Mark this box as “Open First”.
 With window cleaner, all-purpose cleaner, paper towels, and few rags, you can do wonders! Mark as “Open First”.
 Reinforce the bottom of the box with multiple large strips of tape placed at differing angles. Layer the bottom of the inside of the box with a few pieces of crumpled wrapping paper to provide cushion & then start packing. Look under the tips, there are some suggestions for contents in each size box.
 You can also wrap using your kitchen towels to secure items. Watch the video for more info on How 2 Pack Breakables.
 Throw out items that are expired or won’t make it through the move. Leave out a few snacks and water bottles so that you have something to munch and sip on.
 A medium box is ideal to pack these items.
 Use several layers of wrapping paper, roll up, and secure entirely around with a layer of packing tape. Clearly mark package in large red print (KNIVES/CAUTION).
 Fill up any empty spaces on top or around the insides of boxes with crunched up wrapping paper, bubble pouches, towels, blankets, or sheets.
 Be sure to mark fragile boxes as such in large red print (FRAGILE). If you are not keeping a list detailing the contents of each box, write few words on each box so you will know what is inside. Close and tape the top of the boxes. You will be so glad you took the extra time to secure your items properly.

 Pour the Kahlua straight into the center of the glass. Try hard not to get any up the walls of the glass, as this might disrupt the layers.;
, The tip should be touching the wall of the glass, just above the Kahlua. The handle of the spoon should be resting on the rim of the glass. The dome of the spoon should be facing upwards.Some people find that it is easier if the spoon tip is just touching the Kahlua. Other people find it easier if it is just above it. Use whatever works best for you.
 As you fill the glass, raise the spoon upwards, always keeping the tip just above the liquid. Make sure that you are pouring towards the handle/your hand.If the two liquids start to mix, finish the layer and wait a few seconds. They will eventually settle and separate.
 Still keeping the spoon tip just above the Bailey's, slowly pour the Grand Mariner into the glass. Again, remember to pour towards the handle/your hand. When you get to the rim, move the spoon away from the glass and finish pouring.


Don't worry if the Grand Mariner spills over. Simply wipe it up with a towel.
 The B-52 is served as is, without any garnishes or ice.

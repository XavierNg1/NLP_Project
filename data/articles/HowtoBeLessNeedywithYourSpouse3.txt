 When people grow up feeling unloved, they often look for the affection and acceptance they didn’t get during their childhood, from their spouses. If the affection isn’t met, they often believe that the other person doesn’t care about them. Even if it’s something as small as not answering the phone right away, the needy person often becomes paranoid about the relationship and becomes even more clingy.


If you have siblings or other loved ones who experienced the same type of childhood you did, look at how they behave in relationships. If they are also clingy with their spouses or significant others, you likely are the way you are because your emotional and physical needs were not met as a child., Needy people tend to have low self-esteem, just as secure people are typically very self-confident. Often, those who are clingy with their spouses are because they are trying to validate themselves. When they don’t receive the love and affection they seek, they often feel even worse about themselves and become even more clingy.


It’s normal to feel good when your spouse shows affection or tells you they love you. However, if you become crushed or think bad about yourself when they give you less than what you want, it could be because you don’t have enough self-worth., A common trait among those who are clingy in marriages is that they have had failed relationships in the past. Perhaps they were cheated on or were treated poorly. As a result, they become desperate for the love and affection they didn’t receive in the other relationships.


If a person doesn’t have high self-esteem or didn’t have a loving childhood and are needy with significant others, their clinginess could be the reason why their relationships failed. Then in the next relationship, they display the same type of behavior, and may fail in that relationship, as well. Until the problem is resolved, the person may continue to experience the same types of situations.

 To make a simple and natural plastic-like substance from simple household ingredients you've probably already got in your kitchen, assemble the following:


1 cup of whole milk or heavy cream, fatter is better
Vinegar or lemon juice
Saucepan
Strainer

, In the saucepan, heat the milk gently and bring it just to a simmer. Be very careful not to boil the milk, which will ruin the reaction.
 Adding a few tablespoons at a time, stir in the vinegar with a spoon until the milk starts to separate into solids and liquids. This is basically the cheese-making process of separating and creating curds.
 Remove from heat and pour the milk through the strainer when it's cool enough to handle. The rubbery and soft stuff in the strainer is the "milk plastic," called casein, an essential part of cheese-making.









By heating the milk and adding the vinegar, you started a chemical reaction that brought out the natural polymers of the milk, and made a natural plastic-like compound.
 See how your plastic stuff reacts when pinched, stretched, or dropped. If you let it sit for a while, or put it in the freezer, it will get hard.









You could also pour it into candy molds or other shapes and allow it to harden in a fun shape. If you haven't painted it already, paint it to make holiday ornaments or natural jewelry as a fun project for kids.
The plastic will be good for a few days, but has the basic shelf-life of food. Throw it away before it molds.

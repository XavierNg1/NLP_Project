 Pour the dry beans into a large bowl and pick through them to remove any shriveled or unappealing beans. Cover the beans with two to three inches (5 to 7 cm) of water and leave them on the counter to soak overnight.Soaking the beans overnight (roughly 10 to 14 hours) reduces the cooking time required, helps them cook more evenly and makes them easier to digest by removing most of the sugar called oligosaccharide, which causes flatulence. If youâ€™re in a rush you can speed up the soaking time by covering the beans in water, heating them to a boil for two minutes, then turn off the heat and allow them to sit undisturbed for an hour.Lentils, peas, and black-eyed peas do not need to be soaked before cooking.
 Pour the beans into a colander to remove the soaking water. Rinse them under cold running water.
 Add eight cups (1.9 L) of water for one pound (453.5 g) of beans.


At this point you can add aromatics if you wish, such as half of an onion, garlic cloves, chopped carrots and/or bay leaves.
 Secure the cover to the pressure cooker according to the instruction manual and turn the stove top burner up to high. When the pressure cooker reaches high pressure, reduce the heat to medium and start the cooking time. Cook for the recommended time for the beans you are using., Allow the pot to cool down and reduce the pressure naturally. Follow the instruction manual to know when it is safe to remove the lid.
 Unlock and carefully remove the lid, tilting it away from you and allowing condensation to drip back into the pot. Use a slotted spoon to remove the aromatics.
 You can now add your cooked beans to any recipe. If you wish to store them, measure out 1 1/2 cups (354.8 ml) of beans into a two cup storage container and the cooking liquid to cover, allowing 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) of headspace. Seal and store in the refrigerator for one week or in the freezer for up to one year.


Label the containers with the date and contents.

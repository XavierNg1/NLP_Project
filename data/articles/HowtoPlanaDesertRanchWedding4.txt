 Succulents and cacti make excellent simple centrepieces that complement the western theme of the wedding. Cacti are local to the region and are relatively easy to care for. You can even use a small plant, such as a succulent, for place cards.For example, buy miniature potted succulents and paint the name of the guest on the pot. This will act as a place card as well as a wedding favour.
 To give your wedding a true barnyard feel, seat your guests at long family-style rustic tables. This seating arrangement works well for a casual barbecue meal. It also looks nice in a big barn reception hall. This allows guests the sit together and get to know each other, rather than separating everyone at smaller tables of six to eight people.
 Mason jars are very trendy and will give your wedding an elegant rustic feel, perfect for a desert ranch wedding. Serve cocktails and refreshments in mason jars. They can also be used to hold bouquets and floral arrangements on each table. Tie a colourful ribbon or piece of twine around the mason jars to complement the colour theme of your wedding.


For example, if rose pink and light green are your wedding colours, you could tie a pink ribbon around each mason jar.

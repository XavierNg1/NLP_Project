 If it's brand new, you are very lucky! New lockers are the best. No mess, no fuss, no worry over what there is to throw out and what not.;
, Items such as locker shelves and magazine racks are perfect for spaces as small as a locker. Organize your exercise/ text books, worksheets, loose papers and novels into your shelf or magazine rack.



For a metal locker buy magnets. These can help keep with important notes and reminders, but also are great for attaching images and photos of your friends, favorite band and favorite quotes. If you want, you can buy post-its, too.
For a wooden locker buy Blu-Tack or any adhesive such as Blu-Tack. Push pins also work but can damage the locker.
 The taller holder can carry spare pens, pencils and such, while the smaller one can hold spare hair ties, bobby pins, chap-sticks/lipgloss, safety pins, bracelets and other jewelry.
 This requires a white board marker and duster. If you do this, you need to buy a sleeve or bag to keep your duster in because it can become exceedingly dirty, ruining your locker. This also applies to chalk. However chalk can become powder and ruin your locker.
 If your school doesn't have a uniform policy, you can keep extra clothes in your locker in case they asked you to change your clothes, or you dirty the ones you are currently wearing.
 Hygiene is also important. Make sure you have a space to keep hand sanitizer, talcum powder (can be used to keep the underarms soft after PE), antiperspirant or fragranced deodorant, breath mints or gum, essentials for that time of the month (pads and/or tampons) and lotion.

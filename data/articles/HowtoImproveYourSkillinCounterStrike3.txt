 If you are using magnum in close quarters and alleys, you are most likely to be killed by an opponent who has M4.


Use M4 as a counter-terrorist and an AK47 as a terrorist






Sidearm: Desert eagle (it is the most powerful pistol)






If the map is a closed one which involves close range fire, choose a good assault rifle,shotgun, smg or machine gun.






Do not use SMG, machine guns and shotguns if the range is big because they are not very accurate. Use assault rifles or sniper rifles instead.
 Most upper level players disable it because it makes aiming a lot easier with rifles and the deagle.
 Do this after buying your weapons/armor. If somebody is camping you can flash him out or grenade him out.
 If you throw it straight in front of you, it will blind you as well. Always throw flashbangs on corners or, after throwing it, hide behind a wall or obstacle and make sure it doesn't come in your view.
 Pinpointing an enemy with sound is very helpful, but there still remains the problem of having to remove that threat. There are options like flashes, grenades, and peeking the player in a one on one situation, but overall your best bet is to take the opponent out without risking yourself or wasting a flash or grenade that you may need later.

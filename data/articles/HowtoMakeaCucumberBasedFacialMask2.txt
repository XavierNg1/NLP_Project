 A cucumber, oatmeal and honey mask is exfoliating and is great for oily or acne-prone skin. Prepare the cucumber by washing it, then cut it in half and peel one cucumber half either with a vegetable peeler or by slicing off the skin with a small knife., Slice the peeled cucumbers into big chunks to make the vegetable easier to blend. Then drop the cucumber chunks into a food processor or blender., Use the puree setting on your food processor or blender and blend the cucumber until it reaches a blended, soupy consistency. Then pour the pureed cucumber into a small mixing bowl., Measure out one tablespoon of ground oats and drop them into the small bowl with the pureed cucumber. Make sure that the oats are ground, not whole, since you want your mask to have a smooth consistency.


If you only have whole oats, you can pulse them in the food processor to create a powder.It’s most effective grind the oats by themselves if they aren’t already ground before you put in the other ingredients.
Oats exfoliate and remove dead skin cells while soaking up excess oils on your face., Measure out and add a tablespoon of honey to the mixing bowl. Honey helps to soften skin and has strong antibacterial properties., Use a spoon to stir the cucumber, ground oatmeal and honey together. Stir until the ground oatmeal looks completely dissolved and the mixture is a wet paste.

 There are two main types of cholesterol, commonly referred to as “good” cholesterol (HDL) and “bad” cholesterol (LDL). Bad cholesterol is what leads to the hardening of arteries, which causes disease. Good cholesterol helps remove bad cholesterol from the blood.When you are trying to improve your cholesterol numbers, it is important to lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and raise your HDL (good) cholesterol levels at the same time.
 Walnuts are tree nuts and rich in a number of different nutrients, including flavonoids which are highly effective antioxidants and anti-inflammatory substances, a form of Vitamin E that appears to be effective in protecting against heart disease, and substances that are effective in protecting against diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and potentially both prostate and breast cancer.


Walnuts are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are critical in reducing inflammation and in improving the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids that can effectively increase HDL-cholesterol while lowering the LDL-cholesterol levels at the same time., Walnuts are a great source of omega-3 fatty acids. Just eating 30 grams will provide about 113% of the recommended daily value of omega-3 essential fatty acids. Additionally, 30 grams provide significant amounts of minerals, such as copper, calcium, iron, manganese, and molybdenum. Walnuts are also relatively rich in B vitamins.30 grams of walnuts is equivalent to ¼ cup of chopped walnuts or walnut pieces.


Walnuts also have significant amounts of fiber and a very low glycemic index, which means they release very low amounts of sugar into the blood.
The calorie levels are relatively high. A serving of 30 grams has about 195 calories. However, remember that these calories come from healthy fats.Limit your consumption of walnuts to no more than 1-2 servings per day, or ¼-½ cup (30-65 grams).

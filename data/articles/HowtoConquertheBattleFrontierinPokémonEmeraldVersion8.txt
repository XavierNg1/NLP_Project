 Using 3 of your Pokémon, you must navigate the dark passageways and climb the pyramid floors until you reach the top. In addition, the player will not be allowed to carry their Bag inside. Instead, a special Bag is provided for item gathering during the challenge. In addition to finding items, you may also encounter Trainers and wild Pokémon. If you clear 7 floors successively and climb to the top of the Battle Pyramid, you clear a set. Furthermore, every time a set is cleared, the inside mazes change. As you are basically walking blind, the Battle Pyramid tests your bravery in the face of the unknown., The Battle Pyramid is the only facility in which you can freely customize the items that you give your Pokémon. Since the floors change with each run through the pyramid, the items will also change. It is a good idea to collect as many different items as possible, as well as keeping your floor streak up., With each run through the Battle Pyramid, you will encounter wild Pokémon which will either be of a certain type, or will know moves that cause a status ailment. Therefore, it is a good idea to carry Pokémon with either abilities or moves that cancel or counter these problems. With regards to status problems, the following list shows how to cure/prevent each possible ailment:

Poison – Pecha Berry, the Ability Immunity
Paralysis – Cheri Berry, the Ability Limber
Confusion – Persim Berry, the Ability Own Tempo
Sleep – Chesto Berry, the Abilities Vital Spirit or Insomnia
Burn – Rawst Berry, the Ability Water Veil
Freezing – Aspear Berry, the Ability Magma Armor
Infatuation – Mental Herb, the Ability Oblivious

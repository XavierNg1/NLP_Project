 Unique names are names that you can build a brand around. At the same time, generic names are names that are easily forgotten or confused with competitors. Thus, try to find a domain name that your customers or visitors will be able to identify.


Think about tying two different words together. For example, the name YouTube is very simple, but is also memorable. Another example could be adding the words "dog" and "lover" together to get doglover.com.
Consider merging or mashing words together. A great example of this is the website Flickr.
Add a prefix or suffix to a word. Spotify is a great example of this.;
, The shorter your domain name, the easier it will be for people remember. Remembering a domain name is very important from a marketability perspective.


Internet experts suggest using one or two words if possible.
The less number of characters, the better. The average number of characters in the names of the top 100,000 websites is 9. A website like Amazon.com is well under this. A website named thebestonlinecandystore.com would be well over 9, and would make an unattractive domain name., In other words, choose a name that is easy to type and say. This will help visitors remember your website’s name. If you don’t have a simple name, people will forget it, might not be able to spell it, and may get it confused with other websites.


Don’t use numbers. In most instances, customers or visitors may forget numbers and confuse your website with another.
Stay away from hyphens. People will forget them.
Avoid acronyms. For example, an acronym of John’s Videos and Games (JVG) won’t tell potential customers much about your business.
Unless it’s catchy, your simple name should give visitors an idea of what they will find at your website.
Try saying the name of the website out loud. The best names roll of your tongue and are catchy. Good examples of this include Google, Amazon, Facebook, and YouTube.

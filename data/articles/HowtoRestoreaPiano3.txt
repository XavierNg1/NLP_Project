 This will require removing all the hardware and labeling each part so that you can reassemble it. You might want to take notes as well to help you remember the disassembly process because the project may take you a long time to complete. It also helps to take photographs of each piece before and after you remove them. Unless you are repairing parts within the main action, do not disassemble the main action., Use a plastic sheet and make sure every part of the interior is covered.

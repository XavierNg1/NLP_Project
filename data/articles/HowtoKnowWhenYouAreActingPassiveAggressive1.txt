 There is a passive-aggressive conflict style that commonly develops in a person with passive-aggressive tendencies. Being able to distinguish the signs of passive aggression in others can help you identify it in yourself as well.;
, Stage one of the passive-aggressive conflict cycle is the development of a belief that direct expressions of anger are perilous and should be avoided. Instead of expressing anger clearly when the feelings begin, the passive-aggressive person solves his anger issues by masking the anger with passive-aggressive behaviors., Stage two of the passive-aggressive conflict cycle is a stressful situation that triggers irrational thoughts based on the early life experiences that discouraged direct expression of anger., Stage three of the passive-aggressive conflict cycle occurs when the passive-aggressive individual denies his or her anger. This denial can lead to projecting negative feelings onto other people, which results in the building of resentment towards others., Stage four of the passive-aggressive conflict cycle is to actually engage in passive-aggressive behavior. This includes (but is not limited to): denying feelings of anger, withdrawing, sulking, pouting, procrastinating, carrying out tasks inefficiently or unacceptably, and exacting hidden revenge. , Stage five of the passive-aggressive conflict cycle is the reactions of others. Most people react negatively to passive-aggressive behavior and, often, this is what the aggressor is hoping for. This reaction then only acts as reinforcement for the behavior and the cycle will begin again.

 Use a heating pad on your back, or take a warm bath or shower. This can provide short-term relief from back pain.If heat doesn’t help, try a cold pack. You may find that one feels better for you.
 Visit a licensed massage therapist for a relaxing massage. This can help alleviate stress and may improve back pain caused by labor, tension, and sore or tight muscles.Try to relax and minimize your stress level as much as possible.
 Start to improve your back pain with an exercise program that gradually increases in intensity. Start by taking short walks for a few weeks – this is safe after vaginal or cesarean delivery. Then when your healthcare provider says it’s okay, gradually amp up your activity:Start doing back and abdomen strengthening exercises, like the pelvic tilt.
Do gentle stretching and yoga, but avoid strenuous postures.
Remember that when you’re lifting, bend at your knees and lift from a crouching position. Be tentative and careful if you had a c-section – recovery is longer after a c-section than after vaginal delivery.

 They are made from pixels which are points of colour.


Using raster graphics is ideal for drawing a photo image on a screen as each pixel has its own colour value. Raster graphics are resolution dependent – this means it cannot be scaled larger without losing quality. This loss of quality makes images look pixelated (the ragged square-like look you see when a raster image is enlarged too far).
Adobe Photoshop creates and manipulates raster graphics.;

The software (Illustrator) thinks of it as a mathematical formula- for example, the user creates a line on a 45º angle from point A to point B for a distance of 50mm and is 2mm wide.
The software draws the line based on this data rather than each pixel. Therefore vector graphics are infinitely scalable – if it’s 50mm in length or 5 meters (16.4 ft) in length the relationship between the points will always be the same.
This is why vector graphics are always used with creating a logo. A designer can create the vector logo and that logo can then be applied to anything from a business card to building signage with no loss of quality. However, vector cannot be used to efficiently draw photo images.

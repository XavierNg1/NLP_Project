 Examine each for what allows the issuer to distinguish you from other customers with club cards they have issued. Usually this is a bar code, but sometimes it's just a number.;
, You should be able to lay many of the cards side by side on the photocopy machine, and photocopy most of them all at once.
 Using scissors, carefully cut out each bar code. Include any alphanumeric information underneath the bar code.
 They should be laid out close enough together to fit as many as possible inside a space no larger than two club cards side-by-side. They should be far enough apart that a bar code scanner can easily scan one without hitting another. Leave enough space along one edge so there's room left to label each barcode.
 You'll need to secure them to the paper so they don't move around. You can use removable tape for this, or a glue stick. They don't need to be securely fastened, just well enough to be able to pick up the paper and flip it over without having them fall off.
 With a black pen, label each barcode with the name of the store or entity that issued the club card for that barcode.
, Cut out the side-by-side card, and fold the copy in half to make your barcode card.
 If you don't have a laminating machine, you can get it done at a local office store or do it yourself: Take a piece of wide clear packing tape, larger than the card, and cover the folded card with it. Flip it over and cover it with a second piece of packing tape. Depending on the width of the packing tape, you may need to use several pieces to cover the whole thing.
 Cut away excess tape, being sure to leave a little clear tape around the edge. Voila! Ready to be used at your favorite store!

, A friend can do this for you more easily than you can do it yourself. Just pinch the seam of the trouser leg down to the size you want and then pin it in place.

Be aware that any narrowing of the trouser leg is easiest accomplished at the side seams. Narrowing somewhere besides a seam causes some difficulties, and it's best to stick with the seams if at all possible.
 If your trouser leg opening is too small to pull your foot through, you may need to add a slit with a zipper or button closure to the bottom of the leg. Alternatively, you can allow a bit more leg room. Just move the pins out a way and test again.
, Use starch if necessary to help straighten out a "laundered in" cuff.
 Make sure you open the seam an inch (2.5cm) extra beyond the needed taper.
, Sew a basting seam (longer stitches than usual) along the proposed seam line.  Re-test your fit and your ability to put on and take off the trousers. If the fit is good, then go ahead and re-stitch the line with a shorter stitch.
 Use fray-chek or a similar product to prevent fraying if you're sewing material that frays easily. Another method of preventing fraying is to "zig zag" stitch the raw fabric edges, or cover them in bias tape.
 Take care to prevent fraying in the hem seams as well.,

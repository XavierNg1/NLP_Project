Purchase a caliper rebuild kit from an automotive store or dealership.
Remove the brake bleeder bolt using a flare-nut wrench. If needed, utilize gentle tapping and penetrating oil to loosen the part without breaking it.
Disconnect both the steel and rubber brake lines using a flare-nut wrench. Replace these lines if they are cracking or worn before putting the calipers back onto the car.
Strip the calipers of pads, shims, springs and sliders or pins.
Remove the outer dust seal.
Place a piece of wood that is slightly thicker than both brake pads stacked together in the caliper behind the piston.
Release low-pressure compressed air into the inlet port. This should cause the piston to pop out.



Lubricate the new piston that came in the rebuild kit with brake fluid.
Insert the new piston into the caliper using moderate finger pressure.



Replace the outer dust seal.
Replace the pads, shims, springs, and sliders or pins. Use the new parts that came in your repair kit, and discard your old parts.
Reconnect the steel and rubber brake lines.
Replace the brake bleeder bolt.
Test the brakes to make sure they are no longer leaking.

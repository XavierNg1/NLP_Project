 Make sure each one gets covered in sauce. If you pour the entire contents of the pot into the casserole dish, it should rise up the sides a bit.


Sprinkle some extra cheese on top if you'd like.
You could also reserve some sauce to serve with the enchiladas.
 Place the dish of enchiladas in an oven preheated to 350 degrees. Bake them until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese has melted.
 Serve with sour cream and chopped cilantro. These enchiladas are excellent with Mexican rice.

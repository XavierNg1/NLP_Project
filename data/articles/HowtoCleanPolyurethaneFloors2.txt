 Polyurethane on concrete floors creates a durable surface. For the most part, you can treat it like you would any durable floor. In fact, it's often used in warehouses and other industrial areas, where heavy machinery is used., Like wood floors, you can simply vacuum up debris. Set the vacuum to the hard surfaces setting to vacuum this type of floor. It doesn't hurt to set it to hard wood if you have that on your vacuum.Otherwise, use a broom or dust mop to remove debris., Most spills won't stick to this coating. Therefore, if you get them up as quickly as possible, it won't take much work to clean them up. Use a soft cloth to wipe them up quickly. You can also use a little glass cleaner on the spill if it won't come up easily., Even though polyurethane is durable, it's still a good idea to use a mild cleanser. If possible, read the directions for the particular coating you have. However, mild dish soap in a bucket of water or a mild floor cleaner should be just fine.You can also use a cleaner like Simple Green (one part Simple Green to eight parts water) if you are trying to clean up grease spills, such as if you're cleaning a garage. Alternatively, you can use half a cup of ammonia in a gallon of water.
Skip acidic cleaners, such as ones with vinegar or citrus, as they can damage the coating., Unlike hardwood, concrete polyurethane can be wet mopped. However, you still shouldn't flood it with water. Simply dip the mop in and wring out most of the water. Scrub the floor gently with the mop until clean.The best mop for the job is a hard foam mop.

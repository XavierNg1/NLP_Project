 This can be done in a classroom or home setting as a dramatic play center, and you can expand it as you like. The child(ren) can help with various items, such as setting up a letter writing area with a notebook and pens, a mailing center with envelopes and stamps, and a cardboard mailbox. Write letters to each other and practice writing the address on the envelopes before "sending" them. Make it even more fun by including other addresses: Grandma, their school, maybe even Santa!;
, Kids love talking about themselves. Teach them one piece (e.g. the state) at a time, and then ask them about it sporadically throughout the next couple of days. Allow them to proudly tell you, "I live in _____!"

, Anything put to music becomes a fun activity for children of this age. If you have difficulty thinking up a melody, use the classic "Jenny (867-5309)" tune - with a little tweaking, it works for any number.
 Actually being able to dial the number themselves can be very exciting for them. If you're home with them, have them call and leave a message. This can become a very fun activity - punching in the correct numbers becomes a "code" to leave a funny message. Before doing this activity, you can make your own homemade "phone" by simply drawing the buttons on a piece of paper, cardboard, or whiteboard and practicing with your child.

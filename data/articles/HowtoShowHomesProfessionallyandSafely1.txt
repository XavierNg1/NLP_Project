 When someone wants to see your home, have your agent schedule a viewing. If you are not working with an agent, schedule a specific day and time for the potential buyer to visit.;
, Keep your lawn mowed, clear of snow and well maintained.


Store any toys, gardening tools or other items in a garage, shed or other indoor location. Keep your cars parked in the garage instead of in the driveway.
 Open up curtains, blinds and shades so visitors can see what kind of views and light they can expect.


Leave the porch light on if people will see your house at night.
Keep lights on throughout the home so people do not have to search for light switches.
 Dirty, cluttered or messy homes do not look inviting.


Display fresh towels in the bathrooms and make sure floors and surfaces are wiped down, vacuumed and mopped.
Put everything away. Present a well maintained appearance by keeping toys in the kids' bedrooms, clothing in closets and other personal items out of view.
 You should leave the house, too, unless you do not have an agent, and you want to answer any questions.
 Set the table with your best dishes, or leave a lovely vase of flowers in the kitchen. Stack books neatly on a coffee table, and use air fresheners to leave a welcoming aroma in the home.

 Take a moment to gather your thoughts before saying or doing anything, no matter how much the comment may have stung. If you know you have a bad temper, or are prone to angry outbursts, read How to Release Anger.;
, You don't have to lower yourself to the level of the ignorant, but if, for good reason, you don't want to let the comment pass without answering it, even if it wasn't directed at you, then you do want to make sure any response is not seen as a fanatical, knee-jerk reaction. As a matter of fact, it's best not to react, but instead, respond in a reasonable manner.
 If there is any doubt, that is. In other words, if the remark was offhanded, and particularly if it came from someone you hardly know, there's a good chance that person has no idea the remark might offend you. Rather than assuming that the statement was intended to be insulting, give the benefit of the doubt, and allow for some ignorance on the part of the speaker.
 If the remark was something to the effect of, "What kind of idiot do you have to be to vote for him?" (and you do plan to vote for him), try responding with, "What would make you say that? What is it about him with which you disagree so strongly?" Find out. Maybe the person has some personal vendetta - some personal reason that made him speak out so strongly. If that's the case, there's very little you can do:

, Rather than engaging in one-to-one personal combat, instead take the more diplomatic tack of just assuming a contrary position, for the sake of discussion: Say, "Yeah, there are a lot of people who feel like you do - but the people on the other side would say that a vote for this man is a vote for smaller government, a better school system, etc., etc." In this way, you are making the argument a bit more general, and therefore a lot less personal - you're saying, "There are those who would see it this way...", you're not saying, "Hey, jerk weed, I'm that kind of 'idiot.' Now shut your fat mouth before I shut it for you." You can see the difference.
 Rather than being inflammatory and picking a fight, like in the previous example, identify yourself with tact and generosity for the other person's point of view - even though that person didn't really accord you the same courtesy. There are times when it makes sense to step up and reveal your secret identity. For example, someone who goes on and on about how religion is the cause for every ill in the world, while you are a devoted Christian. Getting up in that person's face will do little to further your cause. Try this:


Him: "More people have been killed in the name of irrational beliefs like religion than any other cause. The harm ideas like religion have caused is unforgivable."
You: "Wait a second. That's not right."
Him: "Yes it is. If we didn't have religion, we wouldn't have half the problems in this world that we have."
You: "I respectfully disagree. I'm a Christian, and I hear this a lot. The truth is, yes, there have been some so-called holy wars. I don't agree with that, and I didn't agree with the Crusades, either. Nobody should get killed or shunned because they do or don't want to join a particular religion. But the reality is that all the people killed in the Inquisition and the Crusades and all the other holy wars don't even come close to the people killed by Hitler - 6 million + - that wasn't in the name of God, it was in the name of "protecting his master race". Or what about Stalin's 20 million? He killed simply because the more terror he could engender in the survivors, the easier they were to control. And what about Mao, Pol Pot, and others? Their tens of millions dwarf those killed in the "name of God." So while I don't argue about the Crusaders or the Holy War fanatics killing people, I think you're mistaken here."
Him: "Your points only serve to prove my argument. Though Hitler and Stalin weren't religious, they followed strongly irrational beliefs, which are the underlying issue that makes religion harmful."
You: "I never had thought of that before. I understand where you are coming from. There are all kinds of crazy people, of all persuasions. Some people kill saying it's in the name of God, but I really don't think God has anything to do with what those people are doing. You may not agree with religion in general, and I'm not asking you to. But I am asking you to realize that not all Christians are crazy fanatics. Can we agree to disagree?" (So, hold your hand out and offer to shake hands and agree to disagree, if nothing else.).
 If you still haven't made your point, let the other person know that, while s/he is entitled to his/her opinion, likewise, so are you. Let him/her know that those remarks are hurtful to you, and ask that s/he tone it down, if for no other sake than courtesy to another person, on a humanitarian level. Learn how to express yourself with nonviolent communication.
 No matter what the response is from that person who's going off on you, you must maintain your cool. In the end, if you are kindly and gentle in your response to that person, s/he is the one who will end up looking bad to the other people present. No matter what kind of person you're dealing with, the only thing you need to worry about is what kind of person you are.

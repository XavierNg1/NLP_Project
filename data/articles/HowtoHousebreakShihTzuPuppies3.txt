 Be patient with housebreaking and expect your puppy to have accidents. If you see an accident in progress, get your pup’s attention by saying “Oops!” or No, no!” Pick the puppy up, and take it to a designated potty area, whether it’s a paper pad or spot outside.Try not to yell or scare your puppy when you interrupt an accident. It might become afraid to go to the bathroom in front of people, making the housebreaking process much more difficult.  

, If you come home to find an accident or didn’t see the accident happen, don’t rub your dog’s nose in it or otherwise punish it. Even if only a couple minutes have passed, just clean it up without any fuss. Dogs, especially puppies with short attention spans, can’t understand the connection between a punishment and the accident., Use an enzymatic cleaner that removes pet odors to deal with accident spots. You can find a cleaner at your local pet store. If you don’t remove scent traces, your dog will smell previous accidents and want to mark there again., It’s vital that your puppy doesn’t get used to being around its mess. Dogs are instinctively clean and don’t like to be around their excrement. However, if you leave a puppy in its crate for too long, it’ll have to go inside and, over time, might become accustomed to unsanitary conditions.It if gets used to being in its mess, you’ll have a lot more trouble housebreaking it effectively. Be sure not to leave your puppy in its crate for more than two hours, and clean up any accidents as soon as you see them.

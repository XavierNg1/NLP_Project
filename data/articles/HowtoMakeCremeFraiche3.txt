 For the lightest, creamiest eggs add one to two tablespoons and whisk well before cooking over low heat.
 Using your favorite cream-based soup or chowder recipe, switch out the cream for Crème fraiche in half the amount. This will provide a more rich texture as well as a slightly enhanced flavor.
 After boiling and mashing your potatoes, add in half a cup of Crème fraiche with a bit of softened butter and blend. The resulting mashed potatoes will be creamy and light, a perfect side dish.
 Choose a fruit to your liking, although peaches and apricots work well, and grill them with a little brown sugar. Serve with a dollop of Crème fraiche.

 Take it like this. My den or their den? (If neither proceed.) Bahari Bay or Kani Cove? Sunken Treasures or by the ship?

, Keep it a surprise. Plan where to have the dancefloor, fake treats, and fake cake and ice cream! But what if you picked your den? Buy your music for the dancefloor. Buy a school of fish for treats. Plan where to have fake cake and ice cream.
 Ask them if they want to hang out at the location of the party. Now when you get there, type *surprise happy birthday!*. And do your bash.

 After you have unlocked your iPod by swiping the unlock tab from left to right, you can easily go to the home screen by pressing the "home" button on the front of your device., You may have to swipe left or right on the home screen to find the photos icon, which is set to the default image of a picture of a sunflower. The photos icon is usually located on the leftmost screen, in the upper-left hand corner, with the word "Photos" beneath it.
 Opening your photos app should have brought you to the albums section. If not, you should click the "Albums" button on the top left of the screen. This will give you a list of albums, including your videos.
 You can verify that you have located the right video by clicking its icon to check its content. Deleted content may be difficult for you to recover.
 In the upper right hand corner you should see a button labeled "Select." This will enable you to select a video or several videos for deletion. After tapping this button, tap the video or videos you would like to delete. Selected videos will be marked with a white check.


Some iOS versions may have an "Edit" button in place of "Select" that performs the same function., Now that you've selected your video for deletion, you can tap the trash can icon in the lower right hand corner of the screen. Doing so will prompt a "Delete" or "Cancel" dialogue box. Confirm to delete your video.


The video will now be deleted from the iPod, however it will remain in your iTunes library if it has been saved there. If you wish to delete the video completely you must delete it from your iTunes library on a computer.

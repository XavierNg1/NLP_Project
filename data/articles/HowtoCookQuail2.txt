Alternatively, line the pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper for an easier clean-up.;
, Pull the legs together over the back of the quail, then tie them in place using clean kitchen twine.


By tying the legs together, you can help the quail remain steady as it cooks. If you do not tie the legs together, you may need to use celery sticks or skewers to help stabilize them after placing the birds in your baking pan.
 Coat the surface of the quail with melted butter or olive oil, then rub the salt and pepper over all sides of each quail.


Use a pastry brush to evenly coat the birds with the butter or oil. Also note that the quail will brown best if you use melted butter.
While not necessary, you can also stuff the inner cavity of the quail when you choose to roast it. Fruit-based stuffing tends to work best, especially when it makes use of plum or prune flavors.
 Place the quails breast-side down in your prepared pan and transfer them to your preheated oven. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the meat feels slightly firm and the juices run clear.


If you choose to stuff the quail, you will need to increase the overall cooking time by 10 to 15 minutes.
 Remove the quail from the oven and allow it to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve while still hot.


Consider placing a loose aluminum foil tent over the birds as they rest. Doing so traps more heat inside and may allow the juices to distribute more evenly.
If desired, you can serve the quail with lemon juice, wild game sauce, or other similar condiments.

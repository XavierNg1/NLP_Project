 Don’t mislead people. Especially when you are dating someone, be upfront about your feelings. Avoid excuses like “Now is not a good time for me”. While you might think your hint is obvious, some people will take you literally. They’ll call at a later time. Make it clear that you aren’t interested without any equivocation. This doesn’t mean that you need to lose all tact and say something offensive, but you can say, “I’m just not interested. I like you as a person, but not in that way.”, People won’t always catch on to your masterly crafted subtle hints. Sometimes, you’ll need to say something. No one welcomes confrontation, but when it is time to ask someone to leave you alone, you should do it politely. Start off by gaining their attention and then, in a soft voice, ask them if they wouldn’t mind leaving. , No one wants to be shunned for no reason — to be cast aside without cause. Tell the person why they should go. Do you need to talk to someone else? Do you have work that needs to be done? No matter what the reason is, be tactful and give them some indication why you need them to leave. They’ll be more likely to acquiesce to your request.
 Set up your email account to automatically reply to email addresses you don’t want to talk to. Go on your social media accounts and do the same. You might even just consider “unfollowing” and “de-friending” people you don’t want to talk to anymore.The traditional “out of office” email automated response is now a commonly used tool in most business settings. If you know that you are going to be away from your email for a period of time and don’t want to receive dozens of emails about the same issues, simply set up an automated response with text like: “I am currently either out of office or unavailable for . I will respond to messages in the order that it is received when I return to the office on .” This way you don’t have to return dozens of emails and everyone will know exactly what to expect.

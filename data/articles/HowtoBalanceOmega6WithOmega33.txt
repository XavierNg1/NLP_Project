 If you have reduced omega 6 consumption and cannot seem to increase omega 3 intake, it is advisable to take an EPA and DHA supplement. Common omega 3 fatty acids are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and can be found naturally in seafood.If you decide to add an EPA supplement to a diet, make sure not to exceed the daily recommended amount of EPA (often 250 milligrams).
 Fish oils are high in healthy omega 3 acids, and supplements with fish oil are a great way to boost your overall intake. If you have a choice between different types of fish oil, opt for a salmon oil, which is naturally fatty and rich in omega 3.Many fish oil supplements contain both EPA and DHA, and may consequently eliminate the need for you to take those supplements individually.

You should be able to find fish oil supplements at your local grocery store. If not, check a local health food or whole-food store.
Keep in mind that fish oils can have unpleasant side effects, such as a “fishy” aftertaste, bad breath, and fishy burping., Healthy omega 3 acids can be found in some plants and are most concentrated in flax and chia seeds. These are commonly sold as supplements. The specific acid that contains omega 3 in plants is alpha linoleic acid (ALA).You should be able to find either flax or chia seed supplements at your local health food store or a store specializing in vitamins and supplements.

However, because human bodies must convert ALA acids into either EPA or DHA (and do so somewhat inefficiently), it’s simpler just to purchase a fish-oil supplement in order to consume omega 3.

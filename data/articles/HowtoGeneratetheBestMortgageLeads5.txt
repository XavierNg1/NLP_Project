 The easiest method to generate leads is to hire a company that specializes in lead generation. These companies offer a variety of different leads, such as:


Live Transfers-Leads are transferred directly to your phone. The lead generation company gets in contact with mortgage leads. Once the lead is determined to be of high-quality, they are transferred, live, right to your phone.
Direct Mail- Lead generation companies run mortgage direct mail campaigns. The responses from direct mail pieces become direct mail leads.
Internet Leads- Internet leads are generated through opt-in forms.
Aged Leads- Aged leads are leads who are a little older. They’ve usually requested information about a mortgage 30, 60, or 90 days before.
TV and Radio Leads- Lead generation companies run mortgage ads on TV or radio. The people who respond become leads.
Mortgage Lead Lists- A lead list is a list of leads generated from a variety of different methods. Lists typically include the lead’s phone number, email address, and postal address.
 The most important part of using a lead generation company is to find one that is reputable. Make sure that the leads company fits your needs. If you are wanting exclusive leads make sure that you find a company that can offer that. If you are needing the leads to be filtered by location or credit score, find a company that can offer that.

 You need to begin by wrapping the Moby wrap around yourself before you create a hold for the baby. Hold the wrap in front of your navel with the label in the middle facing away from you. Fold the wrap in half and place it around your waist. The stitched edges from each half should be on top, closest to you., Take the two ends of the fabric and cross them behind your back. This should form an “X” over your back. The logo should still be in front of your navel. , Choose one of the ends and bring it across the opposite shoulder. Take the other end and bring it across the other shoulder, forming an “X” across your chest., Bring the fabric ends that are leftover around your back, forming a second, smaller “X” just below the larger “X.” Tie it into a knot. Or, you can wrap the excess fabric around to the front of your body, and tie the knot just below your navel.

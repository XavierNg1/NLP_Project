 If you have an old lampshade lying around, see what makes up the skeleton of it -- a wire can easily be had from there. If not, got to your local hardware store.









You'll need a piece of wire much longer than the width of your opening. It must attach at both sides and the ends must wrap together.
 Take one end of the wire and twist it around the edge of the opening on your new lampshade. Then, take the middle, wrap it around the base of the lamp, and twist the other end back onto the ball. Tada!









If the hole you made in your ball is just too big, flip 'er over. Cut a small base into what used to be the top but is now the bottom, and repeat. Problem solved.

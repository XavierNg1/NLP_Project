 Use warm water and hand soap to wash away visible dirt. Avoid touching the wound with dirty hands as this can lead to infection.If you do not have access to clean water, use gloves or a wet wipe to clean your hands.
 Be careful not to rip the loose piece of skin (if still attached) apart. Gently pat or air-dry the affected area afterward.
 If the loose piece of skin is still present, place it back over the wound to cover it before you apply the bandage. This will help seal the wound.


Optionally, you can also use a nonstick, non-adhesive sterile pad and a tubular bandage to hold the pad in place.
Change the bandage a few times a day, especially if it becomes wet. Carefully remove the old bandage, rinse the wound gently if needed, and apply a new bandage.

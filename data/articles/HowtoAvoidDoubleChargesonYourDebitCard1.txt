 When you pay with a debit card, you have to think of it as though you are paying with cash. Watch the cashier to ensure that the appropriate amount is charged and entered into the register. Double charges can occur if the cashier enters an incorrect amount or simply makes a mistake in entering your purchase.At the moment of the transaction, your bank is notified electronically of your purchase, and the amount of the sale is withdrawn from your account and put on hold until the transaction is finalized.;
, Quite often, the cashier may notice the error right away. Alternatively, you need to watch the register and check your receipt as you are completing your transaction. If any mistake happens, you need to bring it to the cashier’s attention before anything else goes into the register., This is the appropriate result for a credit card purchase, but it is not the best solution for a debit card purchase. If you are using a debit card, you should ask the cashier to enter an immediate return of the amount of the error.Voiding the transaction will correct the problem, but it is slower and may tie up your money. By voiding the transaction, your money will still be on hold for about 30 days. If the cashier enters a return, that new transaction should take place right away, putting the money back into your account.
If you notice that the cashier made a double charge, just suggest, “Instead of voiding the sale, would you please enter a return to my account of that amount? It makes a difference to the way my bank handles the money.”

Drop the artichokes carefully into the pot once the water begins to boil and leave them to cook for 30 to 45 minutes.
Drain artichokes with the stem up before serving.



Place a couple inches (4 cm) of water into a pot to boil with a steaming basket on top. Add some lemon juice and salt to flavor the water if you prefer.
Drop the artichokes into the pot once the water begins to boil and steam for 15 to 20 minutes.
Drain artichokes with the stem up before serving.



Slice the artichokes in half lengthwise.
Discard the choke, which is the inedible part of the artichoke just above the heart that looks like a bunch of tiny hair.
Drizzle or brush the artichoke with olive oil and place it on the grill carefully, turning it once to get color on both sides.

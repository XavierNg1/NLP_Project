 Save up for an engagement ring well in advance so that you can buy it without taking a bit hit financially. Open a dedicated saving account without an ATM card, so that you won't feel tempted to spend any of the money in it. You can also consider saving money in small ways over a period of two to three months by:Selling unwanted items on websites like Craiglist or Ebay
Cutting back on unnecessary expenses (e.g. dining out)
Buying generic products whenever possible
Optimizing your cell phone plan to prevent monthly overpaying

, There are many small ways to cut down the cost of an engagement ring. These options can be discussed with jewelers when you are shopping for the ring. Ask about:Emerald cut stones, which cover a larger surface of a ring than other stones
A halo setting, a circle of small stones around a center stone, which makes the middle stone look larger
Pave diamonds, tiny diamonds that add extra sparkle to the setting or band of an engagement ring for less

, Choosing a ring that your partner will love means considering their tastes before deciding on anything. If they haven't already told you about what they'd like their engagement ring to look like, take clues from elsewhere, and consider having it engraved to make the gesture extra special. Think about the jewelry that they already own and wear frequently, and note if it is:


Bold or understated
Yellow gold, white gold, platinum, or silver (and choose a metal that will match)
More circular or square in shape (e.g. necklace charms or earrings)

, Presenting an engagement ring to your partner in a surprising, creative way can make your proposal especially memorable. Be unsuspecting by hiding the ring in a box much larger than the ring box, or in a bottle of champagne. Alternatively, be romantically obvious by getting down on one knee, holding up the ring box, and opening it in front of your partner.

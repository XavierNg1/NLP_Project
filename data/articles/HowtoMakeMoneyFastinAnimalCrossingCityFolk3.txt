 A fishing tourney, a holiday,a flea market or even a day when a someone special enters the town (like the person who takes old carpets named Sahara). You may get something you can sell., Spend a little time hitting each rock in your town, until you find one that money comes out of. Keep hitting that rock until money doesn't come out anymore.

When hitting "money rocks", make sure that you hit the rock on each of the user accounts, because there is a rock for each person. As many as 8,100 bells come out if you hit the rock as fast as you can.

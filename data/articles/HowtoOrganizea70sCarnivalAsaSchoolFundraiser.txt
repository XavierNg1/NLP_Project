 Yeah, it sounds weird, but if there are not decorations your carnival will become epic fail for sure. Decorations create a special atmosphere which let all people feel that 70-s. Talking about 70's, your possibilities are endless. It is a cute idea to use a lot of posters of movies that were super-popular in 70's. You can use pictures of actresses and actors, too. You can even choose only one movie and make all Carnival dedicated to it.

The Exorcist
Annie Hall and many others.

Robert De Niro

 It's better to use strict dress-code for school Carnival. Don't let kids to come without at least one or two cute details. EVERYONE should be dressed up, tidy and clean!

,, It shouldn't be a must for everyone, you can just make some zones to play. It's better to have many little "playgrounds" and let people dance on whole rest territory.

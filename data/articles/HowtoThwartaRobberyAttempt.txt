 Don't let your 10-year-old son try to be a hero, chances are they will just get in the way or they could possibly be hurt or injured.;
, This step is important even if you do manage to put down the burglar(s) it's a wasted effort if you're stuck.
 A knife, bat, or scissors will work, anything that could possibly injure the burglar(s).
 Turn the lights on and get a good look at the burglar before you write him down as a burglar. Is he your daughter that is trying to sneak out or back in late?

, Most are trying to get valuable objects, not to shoot everybody in the house. Also note though that most will be armed and there are some out there that will shoot out of fright.
 Aim your firearm or weapon in a position that could possibly injure or kill him but don't shoot. Depending on your state's or country's laws, even if it is in defense or on your property, you could still be fined or arrested.
 Police normally tell their suspect to get down on the floor, a man on his knees does have a possibility of grabbing a weapon or object and shoot or hit you. If he is on the floor he is close to immobile.
 Keep a constant eye on the burglar. When the police get there identify yourself to them and keep you hands where they can see them. Drop the weapon if you have one away from the burglar. Don't be upset when the police put you into handcuffs to for the time being. They are just trying to figure out what is going on. Once they learn you are the home owner they will let you go.

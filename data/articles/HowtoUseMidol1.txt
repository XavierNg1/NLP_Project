Acetaminophen is a drug used in relieving pain.
Caffeine is used to increase alertness and boost energy. The recommended dose of Midol Complete Caplets contains the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee.
Antihistamine serves as an anti-inflammatory drug that relieves swelling during a woman's menstrual period.;
, If you have liver disease, you need to talk to your doctor about taking Midol. Having liver disease compromises the body's ability to absorb Midol.


Be careful taking Midol Complete Caplets if you are taking other drugs that contain acetaminophen, as you do not want to exceed the recommended daily allowance of this drug (4000 mg per day).
Avoid taking this drug with three or more alcoholic drinks. Your liver will have a difficult time metabolizing Midol if it is taken in addition to alcohol (a harmful substance to the liver).
 Take 2 caplets of Midol with water. You need to take the drug every 6 hours or as needed.Never take more than the recommended amount of Midol (as indicated on the packaging). You should never exceed six caplets per day.

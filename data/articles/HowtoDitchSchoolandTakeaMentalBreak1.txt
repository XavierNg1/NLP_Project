 Get dressed, shower, and eat breakfast as if you are going to school.;
, Do not wear really tight skinny jeans and tight imitation prep tees like, American Eagle, Hollister, Abercrombie, or Aeropostale. You don't want to scream teenager from afar or even up close. You must dress like you are older, so pull out the old sweater, boots, looser skinny jeans. You might even wanna try sweatpants.


Girls: Do not wear jeans that look like they came out of a spray can; drop that. Wear preppy sweaters and fitted boot cut or loose denim. Trouser pants are better. You should wear minimal make up, lip stain, and mascara. Do not carry tote bags, but opt for medium sized purses that have structure. Avoid tacky-looking glittery or bags with childish designs as well.






Boys: Drop the baseball caps and skater styled sagging pants. Yes, this means you must use a belt and keep your boxers in tact. Wear some of your dad's shirts, or maybe his sports coat. You want to appear to be over the teen crowd.
 Fruits, sandwiches, and drinks would be ideal. If you snack a lot, think, it is going to be a fun 8 hours, you need energy to keep you alert.

 The ligation method involves tying a piece of thread around the base of the skin tag, cutting off circulation and causing it to die and fall off. Any piece of thin string will do, but suturing thread and dental floss are two common options. Other options include fine fishing line, or even small rubber bands.
This is a good option for people who are squeamish about cutting the tag themselves or reluctant to pay for treatments at the doctor's. There is no blood and it is completely painless.
 This is the tricky part, especially when the skin tag is on your neck. If you opt to do it yourself with the aid of a mirror, you may be able to lasso the tag by carefully placing the loop of a slipknot over it. Pull to secure, ensuring it's tight enough to cut off the blood supply.


This may take some practice and persistence as the loop tends to slide of the skin tag as you pull the knot tight. If this is the case, your best option may be to enlist the help of a friend.
 Leave the string tied around the skin tag, tightening it if necessary. As the skin tag's blood supply is cut off, the tag will dry out and soon fall off.


Be aware that the size of the skin tag, and how well you tie it off, may affect how quickly it drops off.
When it falls off, the skin beneath will already have healed, so there will be no need for disinfection or bandages.
 If your tied off skin tag is visible or easily chafed by your clothing, you may wish to cover it with a small bandage while waiting for it drop off. Chafing may cause irritation, redness or inflammation in the skin immediately around the skin tag.


By preventing further chafing and irritation, the redness and inflammation will subside relatively quickly.

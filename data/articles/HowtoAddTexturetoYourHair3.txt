 Dry shampoo can be a life saver on no wash days and when you want to add texture. Sprinkle or spray your favorite dry shampoo by tilting your head to one side and lifting roots with your fingertips. Lightly rub the product into your scalp for an extra lived-in look, but make sure you don’t brush your hard work out., Short hair needs texture sometimes more than longer styles. Piece out the ends of a short cut with pomade. Scoop out a fingernail sized amount, rub it between your hands and piece out the ends with your fingertips and your palms by rubbing them on 1 inch (2.5 cm) sections of hair. Use a light pomade for fine hair and a heavier one for thick hair., Texturizing spray is great for all hair types, because it adds weightless volume and light hold. You can layer many of them for added hold too, so spray it a little more on buns, braids and curls. Tilt your hair over to the side, flip your roots up with your fingers and spray away for body in medium to long lengths., Texture powder, sometimes referred to as teasing powder, will give your style serious lasting power. Sprinkle texture powder onto your roots and rub it in with your fingertips for volume in any style.Prevent your style from falling flat by not combing or brushing the powder out.

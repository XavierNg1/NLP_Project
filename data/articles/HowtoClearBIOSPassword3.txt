 If you don't have a jumper and your CMOS battery is not removable, or you are using a laptop where you can't access the motherboard, you may need to find and use the "backdoor" password to access the BIOS>


A "backdoor" password is a password built-in to the BIOS by the manufacturer. It is hidden, so you'll need some special software to find it.
 This will lock the computer and display a "System Disabled" message. Don't worry, when you reset the computer it will go back to normal and no data will be lost. You need to do this in order to see the code required to find the backdoor password.
 When you see the "System Disabled" message, you'll see a series of numbers and letters. Write this down, as you'll need it to find the password later.
 Open bios-pw.org/ on another computer's web browser. This website can generate backdoor passwords based on the code that was displayed., The website will attempt to generate a password that matches your computer. You may be given several passwords to try.


Note: If you didn't get a code when the system was disabled, your computer may use its own serial number to generate a backdoor password. Click the "More details" link at bios-pw.org/ and follow the instructions to download and run the correct script for your computer's manufacturer.
 After entering the correct password, make sure that your BIOS settings are correct so that you won't be locked out again. Unlike the jumper and CMOS battery methods, entering the backdoor password will not reset your BIOS settings.

 Certain gels can help straighten your hair. Much like a flat iron, they will only work temporarily to remove curls. Take some time choosing the right get for your hair.


Ask your stylist to recommend a straightening gel. He or she will have the best idea of what would work on your hair given its type and length.
You can also read reviews of gels online. Websites like Amazon allow users to leave reviews. Beauty of haircare websites often provide product reviews.
Read any warnings of the products you're looking at before purchase. Some gels may not recommended for hair that's been permed, dyed, or otherwise styled.
 Use a gentle shampoo and smoothing conditioner, as this will help with the straightening process. Straightening can be tough on hair, so high quality products will help minimize harm. When you're done, pat dry your hair with a towel.
 After your hair is dry, add a dime-size bit of gel to your hair. Move the lotion throughout your hair evenly, moving from root to tip. Do not use too much gel, as this can leave your hair limp.
 Once you've added the gel, it's time to blow dry your hair. You can brush your hair while blow drying to help the straightening process.


Use a round bristle brush. Run it through your hair, pulling it straight, as you blow dry.
If your hair is thick and takes a long time to dry, alternate between hot and cold settings on your hair dryer. This can prevent hair damage.
 If you have particularly thick or long hair, you may need to section your hair using clips during the drying process. Take the top half of your hair and clip it, using a bun or hair clip, on the top of your hair. Dry the bottom of your hair first. When you're done, unclip or untie the top layer of hair and dry that section.

 Dry mouth can lead to weakened tooth enamel. Saliva helps prevent demineralization, and chronic dry mouth is caused by reduced saliva production. Even if you do not suffer from chronic dry mouth, antihistamines, medication, and even wine reduce saliva production. Components in saliva actually maintain and repair your enamel, so dry mouth can be damaging to tooth enamel. An autoimmune disease called Sjorgren's disease is frequently associated with having a dry mouth. If you frequently have a dry mouth and dry eyes, see your doctor to get you checked for Sjorgren's disease. You might also have joint pain, swelling, and stiffness; swollen salivary glands; skin rashes or dry skin; vaginal dryness; dry cough; and fatigue., Acid reflux, bulimia, and celiac disease all put you at increased risk for tooth enamel loss. Acid reflux causes stomach acid to travel up your esophagus and even into your mouth. Those who suffer from bulimia make themselves vomit, subjecting their teeth to stomach acid. In both cases, the acid burns away tooth enamel, so make sure any acid reflux condition is under control whether through diet or medication. The reasons for tooth enamel problems among those who have celiac disease are still unclear, but the majority of those with the illness have accompanying tooth enamel problems. , Grinding and biting can create an enormous strain on your teeth, leading to the possibility of enamel loss. Many people grind their teeth as they sleep and do not even realize it. A night guard for your teeth may help prevent the wear and tear caused by grinding.

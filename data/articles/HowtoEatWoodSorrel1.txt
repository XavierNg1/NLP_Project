 Set your stove for medium heat. Measure out about three tablespoons (45 mL) of butter. Wait for the butter to melt., Chop up about ½ cup (120 mL) green onion. Wild onion, another spring harvest plant, can be used instead of store-bought onion.


The soup can be made with only onion and sorrel, but you may also add celery, carrot, and lentils., Turn the stove’s heat down to a medium-low setting. Cover the pot and let the onion cook for about ten minutes. You may also stir the vegetables from time to time to make sure they get a little soft but don’t change color.
 Pour a quart (950 mL) of chicken or vegetable stock into a pot. Turn the heat setting on another burner to low and bring the stock to a simmer., Turn up the heat. Use about four to six cups (950-1900 mL) of chopped sorrel leaves. Add a pinch of salt along with the sorrel and stir the stock. Watch the sorrel, since it wilts quickly.
 Once you notice that the sorrel has wilted, lower the heat on the stock to medium-low. Cover the pot and cook the sorrel for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally.
 After ten minutes, add three tablespoons (45 mL) of flour. Stir it into the stock. Raise the heat to medium and let the stock cook for three minutes.
 Pour the stock into the pot with the onions and other vegetables you used. Use a whisk to stir the pot as you do this. Keep this pot at a simmer.
 Combine two egg yolks with ½ cup (120 mL) cream in a separate bowl. To prevent the eggs from scrambling, ladle in three spoonfuls of soup as you whisk the egg and cream with the other hand. Afterwards, whisk the mixture into the remaining soup., Add a tablespoon (15 mL) of butter to the soup. Turn the heat down low so the soup does not simmer. After five minutes, the soup will be ready to serve.

 You may notice that every time you touch her, such as grab her shoulder or lightly touch her hand, she might have many different reactions. For example, if she's shy or afraid to show that she likes you because she's absolutely terrified of rejection, she might move her hand away almost as soon as you touch it or give a small jolt when you touch her shoulder. If she's a more confident girl who wants you to make the first move, she's more likely to look into your eyes when you touch her or move her hand closer to yours when you touch hers. It really just depends on the girl.

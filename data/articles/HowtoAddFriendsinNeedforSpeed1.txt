 You can launch the game from the Start menu or desktop, if you created a shortcut there during setup.;
, Enter your username and password into the fields provided, and click “Sign in.”


After logging in, NFSW will initiate an update. As soon as NFSW has finished downloading and installing all the required updates from the Internet, a dialog box with a “Play” button will appear.
 Click on the “Play” button, and press “Enter” or any other key to start. This will load and display your NFSW profile details.


Click “Enter World” to enter the NFS World in Free Roam mode.
Free Roam is a mode in the game (and most other modern NFS titles) that allows you to tour the racing world to find races or other drivers.
 Once you are in Free Roam mode, drive around the city to find other drivers. You can navigate your car by using the following keys: Up Arrow key to accelerate, Left and Right Arrow keys to steer left and right respectively, Down Arrow key to brake and reverse.
 When you sight another car (racing cars, not civilian traffic), drive up to it. The driver’s username will be displayed above the car.


Racing cars are identifiable through their flashy appearance.
 Do this by right-clicking the username and selecting “Add Friend.” You will receive a notification that a friend request has been sent to the driver. Wait for them to respond to it.


When and if they accept your friend request, you will receive a notification on the Requests tab on the game’s Social screen (press “O” on the keyboard).
The driver you added will then be included on your NFSW Friends List (viewable by clicking the Friends tab on the Social screen).

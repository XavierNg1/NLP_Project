 On the bottom of the phone case, you’ll find the battery indicator lights. Close to the lights, you will notice a small tab that can be pried with a fingernail.;
, Take the tab and slowly pry out the rubber outer casing. Roll it off the secondary casing as well.
 With your thumb and index finger, pull out the bottom module. This is the part that connects to the iPhone’s charging and USB port.
 From the bottom of what’s left of the case assembly, pull out the back portion of the case to separate it from the front protective panel. This will remove the battery of the case.

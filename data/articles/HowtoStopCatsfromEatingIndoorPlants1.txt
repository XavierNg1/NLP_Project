 Purchase a non-toxic spray deterrent that is designed to repel cats. Spray this on your indoor plants. The bitter taste will quickly stop the cats from eating the plants. Just ensure that the spray you choose won't damage your plant.You may need to spray the plants every few days since the scent of the spray will disappear after a few days.;
, You want to startle the cats so they immediately stop. However, you don't want the cats to associate being startled with you punishing them. So you'll need to be sneaky about startling them or set up something to fall over if the cats get past it and begin to eat the plants.For example, you could line up empty cans or bottles near the plants. If your cats try to eat the plants, they'll end up knocking over the cans or bottles which should startle them away.
If you're paying attention to your cats, you can try to spray them with a water bottle when they begin to eat the plants. Just ensure that they don't see you spraying them.
 Pay attention to the indoor plants that your cats like to nibble on. Move those plants to a room that your cats don't have access to or place them high up so your cats can't reach them. This may mean that you'll need to place them on a tall shelf or adjust the light in the room so the plants can still thrive.


If you move the plants high up, ensure that the cats can't climb up on anything to get to the plants. You don't want to make it into a game for your cats!

, Another great way to startle your cats away from the indoor plants is to place noisy material, like aluminum foil, near the base of the plants. Lay several strips or sheets of the foil down around the plant so the cats would have to walk over it to get to the plant. The noise of walking over the foil will startle them away.You could also place bubble wrap or another material that your cats dislike walking on, like double-sided tape.

 Book your flight on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Since most travelers need to fly on or directly preceding/following the weekend, you can save even hundreds of dollars in some cases by arranging a less crowded, less expensive midweek flight.;
, Browse travel websites, your airline's website, or competing airline websites for the day you've decided on departing. Ticket prices often vary by hour of day - sometimes morning flights are less expensive than afternoon flights, or vice versa.
 Booking your flight on a holiday itself, such as Christmas or Thanksgiving, can surprisingly yield much bigger savings than the day before or after. This is because most people want to get to their destination before the holiday, and will often opt to pay more for an earlier flight.
 These can help you compare airfare by date, time, airline, cabin preference, etc.

 Do your best to get at least seven or eight hours of sleep for the week after your big holiday party. Go to bed and wake up at consistent times. If you stayed up too late making merry, you might find that both your quality of sleep and regular sleep cycle have taken serious blows.Sleep and rest will help your body devote energy to the organs and glands responsible for detoxing.
Getting the right amount of sleep will also help get rid of those dark circles under the eyes that always seem to appear the morning after a big party.
 While you certainly want to get your beauty sleep, exercising will help your skin and muscles sweat out your holiday indulgences. Stretch out your muscles, hop on a treadmill, or go on a brisk jog around the neighborhood.Make sure you don’t overdo it. No need to get into heavy lifting or sprinting - stick to stretching and cardio.
 Round up your rest and relaxation routine with a nice hot bath. Add a cup of epsom salts and a couple tablespoons of an essential oil, like lavender or rosemary. In addition to soothing you and helping you relax, the salt and oil will help pull toxins out of your skin.If you think you might be allergic or sensitive to any oils, it’s a good idea to test it out by dabbing a tiny amount on your forearm beforehand. If any redness or swelling occurs, don’t put it in the tub!

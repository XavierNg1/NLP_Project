 The foundation types for a log house are pretty much the the same as foundations for any structure of comparable size and weight. The difference comes in the weight of the walls, and the means of attaching the first round of logs to the foundation. Some of your options include:



The pier or stilt method. This is a popular and relatively inexpensive option, however the sub-floor will require extra insulation to keep your feet toasty in the winter. This type of foundation is also not as stable as some other options, which can be a downside if the log house is located in an area prone to storms or tornadoes.

The pre-cast panel system. This is a newer type of foundation which is becoming increasingly popular due to its fast installation and the fact that it does not require a footing.

The hollow foam block. This type of foundation consists of stacked, interlocking Styrofoam blocks. It can be built very quickly and is quite stable due to reinforcement bars which are placed between the blocks.
 Raising the cabin walls can be tricky. You must carefully align the logs so that they stack straight upwards. Since you are working with a natural material, some of the logs will be curved. The overall objective is to have the average center of all the logs bear down on the center line of the wall, which in turn bears on the centerline of the foundation.
 Windows and doors in a log home should be located with consideration for solar aspect, prevailing winter winds, roof avalanche potential, and the structural elements of log construction. Face the majority of windows south for natural light and passive solar heat.
 There are many ways to put a roof on your log creation to shelter it from the elements. The classic log house had a low-pitched roof with generous eave and gable end overhangs.

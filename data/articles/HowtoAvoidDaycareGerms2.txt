 As soon as your child gets home, take off their daycare clothes and put them in the wash. If you had extended contact with your child or other children at daycare, you should also put yours into the wash.This helps remove any germs clinging to your childâ€™s clothes and keeps them from spreading around your home.
 Many daycares have strict rules about children coming to daycare sick, while others are more lenient. If possible, choose a daycare that does not allow children to come if they have a fever over 101 degrees Fahrenheit, a cold, diarrhea, vomiting, sore throat, or pink eye.This means you should also keep your own child at home or out of daycare when they are sick.
 When choosing a daycare, make a checklist to ensure that the standards for cleanliness are high. This protects your child from getting sick unnecessarily.Make sure there are handwashing procedures for the kids and that hygiene habits are taught and enforced.
Ask whether or not the toys are cleaned daily, and how they disinfect them to prevent germs.
Ask the staff about the diaper changing procedures. They should wear gloves and have an area to change diapers away from the other children and any food.
 Many children pick their noses. By digging into their nose, they are getting germs on their hands that can be spread. If they already have germs on their hands, by sticking them in their nose, they are putting themselves at risk to get sick.Help teach your child to use a tissue and keep their fingers out of their nose.
Try to also instruct your child to sneeze or cough into their elbow.

 Working together with CAD, CAI makes for a faster and easier process for comparing products to their digital counterpart.


Using 3D laser scanning, a product can be 3D inspected, and surfaced to compare the physical part to the design with the use of a color map and point clouds.
Producing point clouds gives the ability to measure everywhere instead of being limited to certain parts on a drawing.;

D scanners are fast and can be mounted to an existing CMM. It works by measuring the reflected image from an object with a positioning sensor.
Laser trackers calculate the relative distance between points on an axis. With that information and knowing the wavelength of the emitted light, the distance between two points can be determined.
 Using CAI with the CAD database makes it easier to compare the digital 3D product to the original, helping make the see whether the deviations are marginal or serious, and ultimately saving the product from failing inspection.

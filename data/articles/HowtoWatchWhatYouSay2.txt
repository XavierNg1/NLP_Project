 Instead of getting dragged into a conversation you’d rather avoid or feeling goaded into saying something you’ll instantly regret, tactfully evade or change the topic of conversation.


Plead ignorance: “I’m sorry, I don’t know Joe well enough to say anything about how he spends his free time.”
Correct others gently: “As far as I know, that was just a rumor.”
Change the subject: “Speaking of (politician X), did you notice how many campaign ads there were during last week’s game? — but wow, what a game that was!”
Be direct but polite: “Sorry, but I’m not really comfortable talking about this. Do you mind if we change the subject?”

, It’s not inherently rude to tell someone they’ve done something wrong or need to change or improve upon something — in fact, it’s usually helpful and often necessary. But the manner in which you provide criticism will go a long way towards determining how it is received.


Start with a compliment: “Thanks so much for helping clean up after dinner, without my even asking!”
Follow with your critique: “However, you need to remember to ask before picking up knives and other sharp or dangerous things.”
End on a positive note: “It really is amazing how helpful and mature you’re becoming!”, Basically, if someone is facing a very difficult situation — like the end of a long-term relationship or a cancer diagnosis — you should make the conversation all about their needs and not at all about how you’re being affected.Imagine a series of circles (or “rings”) within circles, with the smallest circle representing the person most directly affected by the trauma in question.
If you want to complain or vent, you should only do so to someone who is situated on a bigger “ring” (and thus, less directly affected) than you. If you’re talking to someone on a smaller ring, offer only comfort and support.

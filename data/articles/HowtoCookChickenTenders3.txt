 Simple and easy, all you need is a heavy bottom skillet, pot, or pan. Fill it with roughly 1/2 inch vegetable oil and heat over medium-high until shimmering, like a pond disturbed by a light breeze. Then, add the chicken fingers, cooking on each side for 1-2 minutes before flipping.Once both sides are golden brown, place the chicken on a paper towel-lined plate to drain and cool.


Be careful of spitting oil when cooking, especially when adding cold chicken to a hot pan.
Don't crowd the pan, as this lowers the oil temperature rapidly and leads to soggy chicken. Each piece should have some room to move.
If the oil starts darkening or smoking, pour it out safely and heat up more oil. Dirty oil won't do your meal any favors., Fill the fryer with your favorite high-heat oil (vegetable, canola, and peanut are all common) and set it to 375F. Once it is ready, toss in the chicken strips, taking care not to overcrowd the pot. They should have room to move around freely, allowing all sides of the chicken to cook. Fry for 6-8 minutes or until golden brown, and cool them on a paper-towel lined plate or wire rack before serving., Baking requires the least oil, keeping the chicken much lighter than frying would. Before you start coating, pre-heat the oven to 425F and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Bake the coated chicken for 15-20 minutes, making sure you flip the tenders at the halfway mark. When golden brown, check that the inside of one of the thickest tenders is cooked all the way through, not pink, and then cool and serve.

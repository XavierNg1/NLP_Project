 You can use a sharp knife or an X-Acto knife to create two foam tubes, if you don't have tubes of that length already. Each tube should be about the length from your wrist to your forearm, so if you are smaller or making these for a child, then they may be a bit smaller than one foot each. These foam nunchuks are a perfect addition to a Halloween costume and are completely safe to use, though they are not the most effective.
 The pen should be positioned horizontally to each tube, and should make a hole from one end to the other. This should be about 1/2-1 inch down from each tube's top.
 Take about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of pipe cleaner, run it through the two holes on one tube, tie it together at the top of the tube, leaving about an inch of space. Then, repeat the process on the other tube, so you now have two tubes with two little pipe cleaner circles at the top.
 Now, just take a thin piece of rope that is around 3 feet (0.9 m) long and tie each end of the rope to the pipe cleaner circles you created. Leave about 2 inches (5.1 cm) on each end of the rope.
 You're all done -- now enjoy your light, safe Nunchaku!

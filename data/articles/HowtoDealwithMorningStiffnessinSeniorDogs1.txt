 If your dog is stiff in the morning, don’t force them to climb up or down stairs in order to get breakfast. Place the dishes on the same level of the house that the dog sleeps on. By the time doggie has had a bit to eat and walked around a bit, they should have worked a bit of their stiffness out., Larger dogs might develop stiffness in their necks as they get older. In order to help them during breakfast, place their food and water dishes on a low platform or step-stool. The raised dishes should be at the level of their mouth. This will save them the trouble of needing to crane their neck downwards to eat., If your dog needs help jumping up on furniture or on the bed in the morning because it is too stiff, help your dog up. Lift your dog gently by cupping it beneath its “armpits” – the spot where its front legs and body meet. You might also place a low stepping stool in front of couches or bed in order to enable your dog to climb onto them itself.Always be gentle with your dog and respond to any signals it gives that you’re pulling too hard. If your dog yelps or cries out, don’t insist on pulling your dog up onto furniture.
 Old dogs may have trouble walking steadily on laminate or linoleum floors. Provide non-slip runners for your dog to walk along.

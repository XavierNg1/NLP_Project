Check with your State Unemployment Insurance Agency as soon as you lose your job to learn more specific information about whether or not you qualify for unemployment benefits.In most states, you will need to be fully unemployed before filing for unemployment compensation.

Note that moving to or living in another state may not completely disqualify you from receiving unemployment benefits.

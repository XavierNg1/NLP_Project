 A drop-down menu should be visible now. It should say things like 'Edit Profile', 'Customize Profile', 'My Profile', 'My Photos', and so on. Click on the 'My Photos' link.
 Are you at your photos now? You should see your albums on this page. If so, you're on the right track! Click on the album that you want to arrange photos in.
 Now, under the dark blue bar mentioned earlier, there should be a more bright blue bar that says 'Upload Photos', 'Back to Profile', 'Back to Albums', and 'Edit Photos'. Click on the 'Edit Photos' link.
 Almost finished! Underneath your album name should be some blue words. Click on 'Arrange Photos'.


Now you should be seeing all of your photos in little light grey boxes. Just click on the photo you want to move and drag it to the position that you want it in.

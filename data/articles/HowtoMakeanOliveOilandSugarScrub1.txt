 Add 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of extra virgin olive oil to a plastic or glass jar with a lid. Next, stir in 2 tablespoons of organic honey and blend until the ingredients are fully mixed.Organic honey offers the most natural scrub, but you can use regular honey instead.;
, When the olive oil and honey are mixed, stir in ½ cup (115 g) of organic sugar. Blend the mixture well until it forms a thick, grainy paste.You can substitute regular white sugar for the organic sugar.
If you prefer a grainy scrub, you can add more sugar.
For a smoother scrub, add less sugar.
 When you’re ready to use the scrub, scoop a small amount out of the jar with your fingers. Rub it into your skin in circular motions for approximately 60 seconds to gently exfoliate.For very dry areas, such as the elbows and feet, you may want to scrub longer than a minute.
 After you’ve rubbed in the scrub, wash it off with warm water. Gently pat your skin dry with a clean towel to finish up.The olive oil in the scrub helps moisturize the skin, but if your skin is very dry, follow up with lotion or cream to hydrate the skin further.

 Before you take blood pressure, the patient should be sitting for a few minutes (about 5 minutes) beforehand. Blood pressure readings should be taken while the patient is at rest with their legs and arms uncrossed., Place the cuff on the upper arm (above the elbow), tightening it well. A mark on the cuff will indicate where it needs to be placed in relation to the artery. The wired part of the machine should be on the inside of the arm. If it's a wrist cuff, place it so the monitor is on the inside of the wrist. Once secured, turn the machine on, and start the reading. Try to remain still or have the patient remain still while it's reading. You can take more than one reading for better accuracy.A reading of less than 120/80 is considered normal. Any higher starts getting into prehypertension (pre-high blood pressure)., Apply the cuff to just above the elbow, tightening enough that you can just fit two fingertips underneath. Slip the stethoscope between the skin and the cuff in the middle of the antecubital fossa, or elbow pit, and put the earpieces in your ears. The gauge for the machine should sit in your cuffed hand, if you're taking your own measurements, or you can just hold it if you're taking someone else's measurements., Squeeze the pump quickly (with the opposite hand if you're reading yourself). When you get to 30 points above what your systolic pressure (high end) normally is, you can stop. If you are working on someone else, inflate it to the 160 to 180 range, though if you immediately hear heartbeats, you'll need to go higher., Begin letting the air out by turning the knob counterclockwise. It should only drop the gauge two to three points a second. Make sure deflation shows steady on the gauge. When you hear the first heartbeat, note where the gauge is, as that's the systolic pressure. When the heartbeat stops, note where the gauge is again, which is the diastolic pressure. You can deflate and remove the cuff.

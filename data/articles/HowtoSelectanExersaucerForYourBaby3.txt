 Most babies enjoy listening to noises, such as beeps, bells and songs.
 Babies like to look at flashing lights and bright colors, so consider these features if you want the most entertainment value out of your product.
 Most modern exersaucers have seats that spin so that babies can change direction easily. Many also let babies jump up and down, getting out their energy safely.
 This can keep your baby from becoming bored after months of use. Look for loops that are meant for this purpose, or see if you can attach a toy arch over the exersaucer.

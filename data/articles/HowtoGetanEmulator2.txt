 Your options for emulators on Mac are slightly more limited than on Windows, but you still have access to some of the most popular ones.


For most retro systems, handhelds, and early 3D consoles, you'll want to use RetroArch. This guide will focus on RetroArch.
For PlayStation 2, you'll want to use PCSX2.
For Wii and GameCube, you'll want to use Dolphin.
 This guide will focus on using RetroArch, as it gives you access to the widest variety of systems.
,,, This will begin downloading the RetroArch installer.
,, You won't be able to launch it by double-clicking.
,,, If there are multiple emulators for the system you want to play, just try the first one on the list for now. You can always download a different one later.
,, RetroArch doesn't come with any games, so you'll need to obtain game files (called "ROMs") on your own. Search for "game name rom" or "system name rom" to find games for your emulator.


It is illegal in most areas to download ROM files for games you don't own.
 Create a folder for each system that you're downloading ROMs for and place the ROM files in them. For example, if you're downloading SNES ROMs, create an "SNES" folder on your desktop and place all of the games inside it.
 This will allow you to add game files to RetroArch.
,, This will start the game in the emulator.

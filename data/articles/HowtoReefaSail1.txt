If there’s any hint of stormy weather, shorten the mainsail before you set out. It’s easier to unreef, or let the mainsail out, if the weather threat recedes than it is to reef while sailing in the midst of high winds.

Watch wind speeds. Reef when gusts become frequent or wind speeds increase by more than 5 knots.






Be sensitive to shifts in barometric pressure, changing cloud patterns and other weather signals.






Reef deeply. Shorten the sail as much as possible the first time. Again, it’s easier to let it out than it is to reef twice.

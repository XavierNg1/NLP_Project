 If you want to say in Spanish that something is a darker, richer shade of a basic color, you can do this by saying oscuro immediately afterward. Keep in mind that this word should be after the color, not before, as it would be in English.For example, if you wanted to say something was dark green, you could say verde oscuro, pronounced BIR-day oh-SCOO-roh.
Some darker shades have their own words. For example, navy blue in Spanish is azul marino. However, until you've learned these various words you can just refer to the color you want to describe as azul oscuro if you want.
 When you say or write the word claro (CLAH-roh) after another color word, you are talking about a lighter shade of the same color. For example, "verde claro" means "light green."As with dark shades, many lighter shades have their own unique word, you'll still get the point across to Spanish speakers if you simply add claro.
 When talking about colors, you may want to say that an object is striped or polka-dotted, rather than being a solid color. You also may use the word estampado (ess-tahm-PAH-doh) to simply say something has a pattern generally.To say something is striped, use the word rayado (ray-YAH-doh). If something, such as an article of clothing, is polka-dotted, use the phrase de lunares (DAY loo-NAH-rays), which also means "spotted" or "speckled" generally.
 You probably know words in English, such as "lilac" or "jade," that refer to both a color and a plant or mineral. In Spanish, you can use "jade" (pronounced HAH-day in Spanish) to refer to something green, or "lila" (LEE-lah) to refer to something purple.For example, Spanish speakers say "rosa" (pronounced ROH-sah) to refer either to a rose flower, or to a rosy color.
√Åmbar is a Spanish word that describes the deep, golden-orange color of the mineral amber. Another good orange word is "albaricoque" (ahl-bah-ree-COH-kay), the Spanish word for "apricot."

 Photos with a theme are always better than random clicks. Thus, it's important that you have a clear idea of what message you'd like to convey to your audience. The theme can be anything from abstract daily life, current issues, to love and emotions. Make you sure you have something in mind before you begin the planning for the shoot.;
, This is one of the most important steps in making a trick photo. Just make a mental image of the photo; or, if the image is complex, take a piece of paper and draw whatever you think your final image should look like.
, A trick photo usually contains more than one photo. Each photo is then either blended together, or parts of it are placed smartly to give the look of a single original photo. This means that you have to take as many photos as it takes to get your final image to look as realistic as possible.
 Once you finish the shoot, you cannot go back later and do it again because the light, location and mood will change and it won't match the previously taken shots.
 You may have taken a lot of pictures; from these, select the ones which you are going to use to make the final image.
 There are several ways to do this, including:


Long exposure (single photo)
Photo manipulation (a group of photos)
Photo stitching, etc.
 For example, to create the image of a man flying:


Take a photo with a man pretending to fly, supported by a stool under him.
Take another picture with no man or stool, just the background.
While editing the images, place the first image on top of the second.
Carefully erase the stool; the background from the second image will fill the erased spot, resulting in it seeming as if you have taken a photo of a man flying.
Similarly you can also add parts from other images into this image and make it even trickier, like adding clouds, a bird or an aeroplane to its background to give a feel of flying in the sky.
, This is very important so as to present the right mood, and bring the focus on the subject.

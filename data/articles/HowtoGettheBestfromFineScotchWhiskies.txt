 These tall glasses are specially shaped to concentrate the aroma of the whisky towards your nose so that smell, very important when tasting whisky, isn't sacrificed.
 Don't add ice, and certainly don't add a mixer. Instead, mix pure still water with your whisky so that it's roughly two parts whisky, one part water.,, Instead, swill the whisky around your mouth. Many of the best whiskeys offer a sensation of different flavours. For instance, the dried fruit and spice of The Balvenie. Give these flavors a chance to wash against the roof of your mouth. Ideally, the taste should linger in your mouth after swallowing, with the warmth and taste remaining for 30 seconds up to a minute.

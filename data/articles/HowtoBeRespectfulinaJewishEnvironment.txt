 They are, from most stringent to least observant: Chasidic (Hasidic), Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist.

, This is especially pertinent to women who (at least publicly) will not wear clothing showing cleavage. On Shabbat and Jewish holidays, they wear their best formal clothes. Married women wear wigs or headscarves, while men wear yarmulkes or kippot (skullcaps) on their heads at all times. Only the men wear tallit (prayer shawls) during services.
 They also have only male rabbis and cantors, and they often (though not always) have prayer books (siddurim) in Hebrew only. Hebrew is read from right to left, the opposite direction to English, and the pages in the prayer books open at what would be the back of an English language book. Some of the men wear their prayer shawls over their heads and move in different directions while praying.
 Sometimes, there are female clergy, and some of the women wear skullcaps and prayer shawls just like the men - and the men don't always wear skullcaps on their heads!

, This is done as a sign of respect to God, so stand up when everyone else does.
 If you're a man, wear a dress suit with a tie and dress shoes. If you're a woman, wear your best hairstyle, dressy dress, simple shoes, simple makeup, and simple jewelry.

 When a child has a severe reaction to an insect bite, his respiratory airways may become constricted. This can cause the child to have a hard time breathing., As stated above, a severe reaction can cause your child’s airways to constrict. This can also cause the child to have a hard time swallowing. Inflammation in the throat can also occur.
 Your child’s immune system will kick in when it realizes that venom has entered the body. The body fights off infection and other pathogens by increasing the internal temperature of the body, thus causing a fever.


Fevers are body temperatures that reach above the normal 36.5 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit).
 Hypotension occurs when the venom reaches the cardiovascular system and causes coronary spasms. These spasms occur in the heart’s arterial system (which includes the arteries). This can cause low blood pressure.


Low blood pressure can lead to shock.
 Immediate medical attention must be administered in severe reactions. Usually, anaphylaxis and these other severe symptoms develop within 5 to 30 minutes of the bite occurring.

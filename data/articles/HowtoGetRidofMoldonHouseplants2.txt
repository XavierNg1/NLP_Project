 Before you act, you should identify if your mold is active or dormant. If your mold is dormant, it will appear as a light color and it will be powdery. If it looks soft and fuzzy, your mold is active., Once you identify that there is mold on your plant, you want to bring it outside. This will help keep the mold from spreading—if it’s active. While outside, you want to find a place that is far away from other trees or garden plants because you’ll be putting them at risk if you clean your houseplant near them.
 Dampen a paper towel and wipe the mold from your leaves. Freshen your paper towel after each wipe. Once there are no parts of the paper towel that haven’t touched the mold, use a new one. Otherwise, you’ll simply be spreading the mold. This process will take away mostly the dormant mold., If your mold is still visible after you’ve wiped it with your damp paper towel, the remaining mold is active. Identify the leaves that are affected by the mold and cut them off at the stem using a knife. Dispose of these leaves., Now that you’ve removed the mold, you need to spray it with a fungicide, bought from your gardening store, to keep the mold from coming back. Spray the plant with the fungicide outside and then move the plant back indoors. Place it somewhere bright. Monitor your plant to be sure the mold doesn’t come back. If it does, simply repeat these steps.Keep your plant in a temperature around 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
Keep the soil dryer than you normally would.
Provide your plant beneficial air circulation.

 You must have Minecraft Pocket Edition 0.9.0 or later in order to encounter an NPC village in the game. Update your app if necessary before continuing.


Your version number is typically displayed on the main menu.;
, Each Minecraft world is generated using an algorithm based on a "seed," or string of text. A particular seed will always result in the same world, so if you find a seed online that is known to have villages, this can make your search much easier. Search online for "Minecraft pocket edition seeds villages," along with your version number and the OS you are using to play Minecraft (such as Android or Apple.) Once you've found a seed that starts you near a village, or gives you directions to one, enter that seed in the "Seed" box when you create a new world. If you can't find one, use the steps below instead.


For Android Pocket Edition version 0.9, try using "kop," "johnny appleseed," or "super pig," without the punctuation or quotation marks. "1388582293" will start you in a massive village, while "AcE" creates a village built on water.You might also need to use the same settings as the person who posted the seed online, such as "infinite" or "flat."

, Click Create new world â†’ more world options, and make sure the checkbox next to "generate structures" is checked. this box must be checked in order to have villages in your world.
 When you create a new world, you'll have several options for which type of world you want to create. "Large Biomes" increases the chance of villages spawning, and makes searching for them easier. "Superflat" increase the chance even more, but you may not enjoy playing on a completely flat world. If these options are not available, choose "Default."


Some devices will lag or crash in large worlds. If this happens to you, you will have to create an "Old" world type, and hope that a village is present in the small, finite world.

 For a long time, researchers have been uncertain as to what causes Shaker Syndrome. The latest research suggests the condition is caused by the body's immune system attacking the cells that produce a neurotransmitter in the brain called tyrosine. Without enough tyrosine, the body cannot properly coordinate its movements, hence the symptoms of tremors, swaying, and poor co-ordination.An alternative name for the condition is idiopathic cerebellitis.Idiopathic means there is no identifiable cause, and cerebellitis refers to inflammation in the cerebellum, part of the brain to do with movement.
Many vets now prefer to call the condition generalized tremor syndrome., Though one of the popular names for the condition is Little White Shaker Syndrome, the disease doesnâ€™t just affect small white dogs. The Maltese terrier and West Highland white terrier are two of the breeds most commonly affected, but despite the fact that both of these breeds are white, the problem does not have a direct link to coat color.


Other breeds affected include the beagle, poodle, Yorkshire terrier, miniature pinscher, and other small breeds., There is no confirmed treatment for Shaking Syndrome. High doses of corticosteroids can alleviate the symptoms, possibly because they suppress the immune system which stops it from attacking the tyrosine-producing cells.The dosage of steroids is tapered until it is discontinued.
If the dog has seizures then intravenous diazepam can decrease the severity of the episode.
Your dog may have to remain on the medicine for the rest of her life if symptoms continuously reappear.

 Find him in the Lumbridge Altar, walking around. Ask him if he has a quest for you. He says that he needs someone to make the ghost go away. He mentions the Father Urhney will be able to help.;
, Once you pass Bob's Axes, go right into the graveyard. Head south into Lumbridge Swamp, and then find Father Urhney in the south-west part of the Swamp. He will be in a little house.
 Say a ghost is haunting the graveyard. He will then give you an Amulet of Ghostspeak so you can talk to it.
 The ghost is inside the small building on the east side of the tiny graveyard. Open and close the coffin to get the ghost to appear. Put your new amulet on, and talk to it. Tell him that you understood him when he asks. He says that a Warlock has stolen his skull, and that may be why he canâ€™t rest.
, There will be a small rock formation just to the east of the mine. Search it to find a skull. A level 13 skeleton will jump out at you. You can either kill it or simply run away, it does not affect the quest.
 Put it back in his coffin so he can rest.
 You will receive 1 Quest Point, some Prayer XP and 5 sets of bones.

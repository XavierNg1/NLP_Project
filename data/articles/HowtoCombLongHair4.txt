 An important part of caring for long hair is making sure that your brush or comb is clean. If your brush or comb still has hair in it, you are transferring the conditioner, dust, oil or germs from the old hair into the hair you're brushing. , You also will want to do a full cleaning of your brush at least once a month. Clean your brush by dousing the brush into a mixture of warm water and a teaspoon of shampoo. Dunk the brush in several times, then scrub the brush and rinse it off. Do not soak your brush, as this can damage the bristles.
 Deep cleaning is more important for brushes, because there is more space for dirt and bacteria to settle. However, it is still a good idea to clean your comb about every other month. Follow the same procedure as cleaning a brush.
 You do not need to replace your comb or brush very often. However especially for brushes, if you notice that bristles are falling out of your brush, or that the round balls at the top of your bristles are coming off, you should invest in a new brush. Old brushes and combs can cause damage to hair if their bristles or teeth are crooked or broken.

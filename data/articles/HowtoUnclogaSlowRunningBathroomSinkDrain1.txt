 Instead of relying on drain cleaner products, which are often corrosive and can cause allergic reactions and respiratory problems,you can use household items you likely already have, such as rags, baking soda, vinegar, lemon, and boiling water.;
, Take Â¼ cup of baking soda, 1 cup of white vinegar, and 1 large pot of water to boil.Have a rag or sink stopper handy.
 Make sure that most of the baking soda falls directly into the drain rather than around it in the sink.
 You may hear a fizzing noise or see bubbles come up due to the chemical reaction. This is completely normal and should mean that the chemicals are eating away at the blockage in your sink.
 Doing so will stop the bubbles from rising up and will keep the chemical reaction concentrated on the clog.
 Allow the baking soda and vinegar reaction to fully work their magic here! While waiting, you should heat up the pot of water to boiling point.
 This step will push down the baking soda, vinegar, and blockage. Watch as you pour in the water to see if the sink is draining any faster. If it is, but still not at its normal speed, there may still be a bit of a blockage. Try repeating the process once more if this is the case.


Prior to pouring in the boiling water, you can also squeeze in the juice of a lemon, particularly if you notice an unpleasant odor coming from the sink.Bathroom sinks are often clogged by bits of hair which can eventually rot and smell bad. This extra step will neutralize the odor and also further help break down the blockage.

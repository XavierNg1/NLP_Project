 Search through your iPad to find any image that you want to capture. You can pick an interesting part of an email, take a screenshot of the app that shows the weather in your town, take a picture of something compelling you found on the internet, take a screenshot of a funny texting exchange you had with a friend, or capture a variety of other images.;
, This button is on the top right of the iPad. This is the button you use to turn your iPad on and off.
 This is the round button that's centered on the bottom of your iPad. There's a picture of a white square in the center of the button.
 Then you can release the Sleep/Wake button (this can be a moment later).



Don't hold down both buttons together for too long - this will power off your iPad. You only need to "click" the Home button, not hold it.
, Just look through your Camera Roll to see if the image appears there. To find your Camera Roll, just click on the "Photos" app on your home screen.


"Camera Roll" will be listed as your first album.
Look for the final image at the bottom -- this is where you should find your screenshot.

 If you have loose leaves, you need to create your teabags. Do this by stuffing your loose tea leaves into a store-bought teabag. You can purchase paper teabags online, the grocery store, or at a cafe. Use one heaping teaspoon (1.5 g) of tea leaves per eight ounces (236.58 mL) of water.If you've purchased your Rooibos tea already in teabags, you can skip this step.;
, Fill your teapot with water and then place it on top of your stovetop. Set the heat to high and boil the water. Rooibos tea tastes best when boiled at 212°F (100°C). You can use a food thermometer to determine the heat of your water.If you don't have a teapot you can use a regular pot.
You can purchase spring water in bottles from the store.
Purifying your water in a home filter, like a Brita, will also enhance the taste of your tea.Rooibos tea tastes the best with filtered or spring water, but can also be made with the distilled water from your faucet.
 Put your tea bag in the cup before pouring the boiling water into it. Consider adding two bags of tea in your cup if you enjoy stronger tasting tea. You can also put any additional ingredients in your tea at this time, like sweeteners or creamers. If you do put additives, make sure to mix them in afterward., Let your tea steep for at least four to five minutes. To get the most out of your rooibos tea, allowing it to steep for up to ten minutes releases nutrients and antioxidants from the leaves. Rooibos tea must steep for a longer time than other teas.

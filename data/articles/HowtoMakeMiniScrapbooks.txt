 The best way to figure that out is to think about something that you really like. Scrapbooks are really descriptive and have opinions, which is why it is best for you to make it on something you know a lot about.Here are some questions you could ask yourself:


What do I like to do in my free time?
What takes up most of my time?
What am I passionate about?
What am I really interested in?
What is that one subject that I can call myself a master at?;
, You can either make it on your own, or purchase one. If you do make it on your own, make sure that it portrays you. It's important that you create something you relate to.For example, if you're someone who is bright and bubbly, don't choose a scrapbook with dull coloured pages. You should instead go for a yellow-orange or red-pink theme.
 Scrapbooks are mainly visual, therefore you need to have a lot of images. You can find them online and print them out.
 You can plan out each page by drawing on your rough pad/book. Draw blocks for where your pictures will be and write where you want your written work to be.


It's important that you know everything about your selected topic before you start doing the written work because if you don't know much about it, you won't know how to express your opinions verbally.
 Write first and then paste the photos.Â If you are using glitter pens, make sure that they don't smudge. You don't want your scrapbook looking messy, do you?If you are using ink pens, which wouldn't normally be advisable, please check that it does not leak.
 Use stickers to decorate it, for instance. If you don't get stickers that relate to your topic, hearts, flowers and stars are the basic types of stickers applicable everywhere.


You can even cover your scrapbook with ribbons or some personal artwork you have made.
 Scrapbooks can be easily damaged if not taken care of, especially when you are showing it to someone else. This is a part of you, so take care of it like you would take care of you.

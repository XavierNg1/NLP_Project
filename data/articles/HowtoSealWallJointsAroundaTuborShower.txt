 Check to see if the caulk has pulled away from the tub or wall, or if it has formed cracks that may allow water to seep through to the wall.;

Silicone caulk is soft and rubbery and often comes off in 1 strip.
Latex caulk is harder and often more difficult to remove. You can locate a caulk-softening agent from a hardware store to help in the caulk-removal process. Use the agent and the least abrasive tool that you can use to remove the old caulk.



Latex is easiest to work with and clean up, but silicone is more durable.
Caulk may come in a squeeze tube, but for others you may need a caulk gun.
 Use a utility knife and a piece of wire or long nail to break the seal at the bottom of the nose piece.


Do not try to squeeze the caulk without piercing the seal because the tube may burst.
 Make sure that the caulk is being pressed into the joint and not just sitting on the outside of it.
 You may also purchase a caulking tool to shape and smooth the caulk.

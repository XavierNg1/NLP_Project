 Administering the eyewash from a bowl is the primary method for flushing eyes that have been exposed to a contaminant or that have a small foreign particle in them. It’s also ideal for everyday relief of tired eyes. The thoroughly cleaned bowl should be large enough for you to fit your face in it.
 Whether you’re using an actual eyewash solution or simply water, make sure that the liquid is between 60–100°F (15.6–37.8°C).Do not fill the bowl to the brim because placing your face in the bowl will cause it to overflow.
 Take a deep breath and dip your entire face into the bowl so that the solution covers your eyes as well. Make sure not to tilt your head too far forward into the bowl or the solution will run up your nose.
 Ensure the whole surface of the eye comes into contact with the water. Rotating your eyes in a circular pattern helps get the water in your eye, which will help remove the contaminant or particle., Remove your face from the solution. By blinking a few times, you will further ensure that the solution gets an even coating over your eyes.
 For dry, tired eyes, you can simply dunk your face once or twice until you feel relief in your eyes. In order to actually flush out a contaminant, refer to the guidelines in Method 1 for the amount of time you should spend flushing your eyes.


Again, you can't over-wash your eyes. If you've been exposed to an irritant, especially a chemical, it's okay to wash longer than the suggested amount of time.
 Don’t wipe at your eyes at all. Simply pat dry your closed eyelids with a clean, dry portion of the towel.

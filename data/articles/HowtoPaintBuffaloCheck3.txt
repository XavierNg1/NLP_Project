 When your paint has dried, place your cardboard square once again in the upper-left corner of the room and lightly trace a pencil straight down the square’s right edge. When you’re finished, slide the square over so that its top edge touches the ceiling and its left edge touches the line you just traced. Run your pencil down the right edge of the square again. Continue in this way all the way across the wall., Adjust your laser level again so that it traces the vertical lines you partially drew across the top of your wall using the cardboard square. You might have to physically turn your laser level on its side, or you might be able to simply flip a switch to get your laser level to trace a vertical line., Once your laser level has illuminated the first vertical line, place a strip of painter’s tape just to the left of the line. In other words, the right edge of the painter’s tape should touch and run directly parallel to the laser line.Then, recalibrate your laser level so that it runs along the second vertical line in the sequence. Place a piece of painter’s tape just to the right of this line. Its left edge should run parallel to and touch the line.
Continue in this way all the way across the wall, alternately placing the tape just to the left or right of the line.
 After taping the wall, the vertically-oriented spaces between each strip of tape will have a different width. Some of these spaces will be wider than others. Paint the wider columns of space between the tape with your final color.When you’re finished, strip the tape off while still wet.

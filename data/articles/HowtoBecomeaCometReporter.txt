, In Mt. Fantage, you will see Comet and Co. Enter that building. On the black board, you will see four topics to report on. Write these topics downÂ and leave space between each.

 Go to your first location and prepare to take a picture. Look in the upper-left hand corner for a tab called "Reporter". Click on it. If you haven't used it yet, you will receive a free camera. You will then need to click on it again. When you are ready, click "Take Picture". Click "Save to Album" to save the image. Repeat this process with all your ideas.
 In the upper right corner, you will see "Photo Album". Click on it. If done correctly, you should see the pictures you took come on the screen. Chose the pictures you would like the submit. If you don't like some, feel free to retake them. On the upper right-hand corner of each page of the photo album, you will see four little tabs. The second tab should be a picture of an envelope. You will need to click on this button if you want to submit the picture to Fantage! If you haven't done this before, you will be required to take a simple quiz.
 Repeat this process for two other pictures you like, then wait. You will be able to see the winners in the Comet, found in the upper-left corner. It's icon is a small newspaper. Flip through all the articles to see if you won! Good luck. Fantagians!

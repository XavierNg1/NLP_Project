 The type of haircut and hair texture you have will often determine whether or not it tangles and is easy or difficult to comb through. For example, if you have fine hair but lots of it, this may tangle up. Thinning the extent of hair may seem counter-intuitive but will both give your hair volume and reduce the tangling considerably.


Next time you're at the salon, ask for advice tailored to your hair type.
 By conditioning your hair, you'll ensure that it's moisturized and hydrated. Dry hair tangles more easily than silky, smooth hair. Conditioning is also less damaging than shampooing, so you can condition daily guilt-free! Every week or so, pamper your hair with a hydrating mask (store-bought or homemade) to give your hair an extra drench., If you toss and turn at night, you'll likely wake up with a bed head full of tangles. By sleeping with your hair in loose braids, you'll avoid a huge, matted mess in the morning. Your hair will be restrained in your braids, and therefore can't get too crazy. Not only will this prevent tangles, but you can wake up with pretty waves., The smooth, buttery texture will help prevent tangles. Not only do cotton pillowcases suck moisture out of hair, they create knots from the friction of the rougher fabric. Satin pillowcases will help you wake up with hair as soft as the material!

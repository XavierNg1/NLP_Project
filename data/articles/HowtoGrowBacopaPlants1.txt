 You can grow some varieties of Bacopa from seed. However, seed grown Bacopa plants generally offer smaller flowers than ones propagated by other methods.;
, Fill a container with moist compost. Sprinkle the seeds onto the compost; do not cover them with soil. Mist the seeds with a water spray. Put the container into a clear plastic bag and place it in a bright area out of direct sunlight, such as a window ledge that is not in full sun.


The seeds germinate quickly; you should see new growth within ten days.
 Consider removing the weaker seedlings at this point in order to thin the plants out and preserve the stronger seedlings. Once big enough to handle, you can transfer the seedlings to individual pots.


Wait until all danger of frost has passed before planting the Bacopa seedlings outside.
 Some gardeners advise pinching off the growing tip once the Bacopa plants get to about four inches in height. This encourages bushy growth.
 To do this, in late summer cut about three inches of fresh healthy stem from a Bacopa plant using a clean sharp blade. Dip the cut end in rooting powder or hormone after you have made the cut.


Remove the lower leaves on the stem, then insert an inch of cut stem into a pot containing cutting mix. You can buy special cutting compost, or make your own by mixing 50:50 vermiculite and sand.
 Water your cutting, then enclose it in a clear plastic bag. Keep the cutting out of direct sunlight but in a well-lit area, such as a window ledge that does not get direct sun. Make sure the cutting doesnâ€™t dry out; mist the cutting with a spray bottle if necessary.


The cuttings should root after about five weeks. You can then transfer the cuttings to individual pots.
 Hardening off means gradually adjusting the plants to life outdoors.


To do this, put them outside during the day and bring them in at night over a period of about two or three weeks.

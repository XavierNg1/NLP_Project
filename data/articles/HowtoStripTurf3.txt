 Use a lawnmower to cut the turf as short as possible.



Place a clear plastic sheet over the turf that you want to remove. Place bricks or other heavy objects around the edges of the plastic to secure it.
 Allow the plastic to lie over the turf for 2 months.
 The ground should be ready for planting.

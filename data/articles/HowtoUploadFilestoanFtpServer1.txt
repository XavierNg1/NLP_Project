 You can find this in the Start menu, or by pressing âŠž Win+E. This window displays all of the drives and devices connected to your computer.;
, This will open a new window.
 This will allow you to create a new FTP connection.
 For example, to connect to Mozilla's FTP, enter ftp://ftp.mozilla.org.
 if the FTP server requires usernames in order to connect, enter the username you want to use. Otherwise, keep the "Log on anonymously" box checked.
 The name is simply for your reference to help you find it on your computer.


By default, you will attempt to connect to the FTP server as soon as the wizard is finished.
 If you are connecting to a secured FTP, you'll be asked for your user password when you first connect. Enter the password when prompted or the connection won't work.
 When you connect to the FTP, you'll see a folder layout much like Windows. Navigate to the folder that you want to upload to. Your user account will need to have permission to access and upload to that folder.
 Drag and drop the files into the folder you want to upload to, just like you would if you were moving files between folders on your own computer. Windows will calculate how long the files will take to upload, and then begin uploading the files. You can monitor the progress of the upload in the box that appears.If you want to upload a large number of files at once, you may want to consider compressing them into an archive first.

 A thumb roll is an alternative to the shake roll that is played by rubbing your thumb across the surface of the tambourine. it is generally more difficult to execute, but provides a more uniform tone than a shake roll.
 To play a thumb roll, press the tips of your four fingers against your palm, leaving your thumb extended. Press your thumb firmly into the head of the tambourine and drag it across the head in a circular motion. The friction between your thumb and the head will cause the zils to jingle continuously.
 Thumb rolls are ideal for short rolls, as they can be more difficult to sustain properly than shake rolls. Thumb rolls can also be substituted for individual strokes in very fast passages.

 This will turn into Autoroute (Expressway) 20 once you cross the border into Quebec. Then, follow this road straight into downtown.
 This will convert to Autoroute 15 once you cross the international border in Plattsburgh, which leads directly into the city.
 However, the more interesting route would be on the 50, where you can see the Fairmont Montebello and the Parc Omega. Both routes take about 90 minutes.
 That's when you will cross the country borders. Then, in about 2 hours, you should be there.

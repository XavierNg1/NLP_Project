 Pay attention to your cat and note if you see any of the following:


Straining to urinate
Yowling, or making other sounds, while urinating
Urinating only small amounts of urine at a time, or none at all
Frequent trips to the litter box
Blood in the urine
Urinating outside the litter box
Changes in water consumption, often an increase
Licking the genital area

, Take your cat to the veterinarian immediately if you see blood in your cat's urine or if the cat cannot urinate at all.


Male cats are more likely to become blocked with sediment from crystals or stones in their urethras, usually caused by inflammation.This will ultimately result in a painful shut down of the kidneys and eventual death.Take your cat to the vet as soon as you notice these urine problems.
 When you take your cat to the veterinarian to diagnose the urinary problem, she will do tests to determine the exact problem and how to treat it. These tests may include:


a urinalysis to determine pH concentration and the presence of bacteria or crystals
a urine culture to determine if there is an infection, what kind of bacteria are present, and which antibiotics will kill those bacteria
blood work to determine kidney health
x-rays to look for stones in the bladder and the size and shape of the bladder and kidneys
an ultrasound to look into the bladder for tumors and evaluate the bladder wall (the inside of the kidneys and the ureters)

, Hospitalization may ensure that your cat gets the care and treatment she needs. This might include an intravenous catheter to give the cat fluids, placing a urinary catheter in the urethra to help clear a blockage, or antibiotics to treat a urinary tract infection. Your cat will most likely need to stay in the hospital for a few days.


Male cats that have experienced one episode of complete or partial urinary blockage are likely to have problems again. If this is the case, you really need to follow your veterinarianâ€™s advice and maintain a proper diet, household regimen and regular medical care.

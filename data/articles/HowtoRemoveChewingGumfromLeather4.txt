 Use a hard, thin-edged tool to do this. You can use a fingernail in an emergency, but should try to find a plastic scraper, butter knife, or old credit card if you can.
 If you are using peanut butter where the oil and solid peanut butter have separated, mix the peanut butter to make sure that the peanut oil is thoroughly mixed into the butter. The oils are what break down the gum fibers and help you to remove them, while the butter is easier to coat onto the gum.


Some peanut butter will stain leather. It is always best to apply a small amount of peanut butter somewhere inconspicuous on your leather (so that if it does stain the leather, no one will notice). Give it an hour or so, wipe it away, and apply a leather conditioner. If it has stained the leather, do not use it to remove the gum., Try to get as little of the peanut butter on to the leather as possible, since oil can stain leather if left for too long. Let the peanut butter sit on the gum for several hours. During this time, the peanut butter will break down fibers in the gum, making it easier to remove from the leather., Use a slightly damp, clean towel to wipe away the peanut butter and gum. The gum should easily come up with the peanut butter. If there is some left, apply saddle soap and rub in a circular motion to get rid of the gum remnants.
 Once the spot has dried, apply some leather conditioner to restore any damage done to your leather.

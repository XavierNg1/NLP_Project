 Open a web browser from a computer or on your Lumia smartphone, and visit the Windows Live login page at “login.live.com”.
 Type in the username and password of the email address you used to sign up for a Microsoft Account. Select “Sign In,” and this should take you to the Account Verification page.


Select the email address where you want to send the verification message to (not necessarily a Microsoft email address) and select “Next.” A verification code will be sent that email address.
 Open a new browser tab and log into the email account where the verification message was sent. Browse the inbox and open the message from Windows Live. The verification code is located on the body of the email.
 Go back to the Microsoft Account tab on your browser, and paste the verification code on the text box provided. Click the “Next” button you see on the web page to proceed and complete the verification process. This should fix the code error 80070490 you keep on getting on your Lumia when you try to download an application.

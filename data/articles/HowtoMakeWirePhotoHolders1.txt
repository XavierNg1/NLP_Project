 Allow an extra 10 to 12 inches (254 mm to 304 mm) for twisting the wire to make circular scrolls and to wrap the wire holders around the base.;
, Hold it tight, so that the wire curls. Continue bending it inward until you form a circle.
 Continue doing this until you notice a circular pattern forming. Once you form 5 to 6 circles, discontinue making the circles and instead gently bend the remaining wire inward and allow the remaining wire to hang down.
 Once you complete this, you can begin working on the base of the wire photo holder.

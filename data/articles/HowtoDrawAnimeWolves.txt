 Finding a reference is useful because this will help guide you on the correct form, anatomy, and basic wolf features.
 Prepare the wolf in ovals for bulk muscle, lines for sheer bone, keeping it on the light side. Try not to overdose your drawing with multiple bones and such., Draw a nose starting to emerge out of the oval of the head of the wolf you've drawn beforehand, and bumps (paws) on the bottoms of the feet. At this point you can even go as far as dividing up toes. This will tend to look awkward if your anatomy structure is wrong, in which case you will need to edit it so it looks right. This is where references come in handy., If the animal is snarling, begin to add elements to depict this. For hair detail, you can tilt your pencil at an angle, and then began adding streaks of nice lines that mimic fur. Some lines darker in areas where shade is present., Erase all the stray marks you added before, that are no longer needed., Go wild! Use reference images to help with drawing the fur in particular, since it usually grows in particular directions around each body part., This is only optional. A fairly bland example with no shading is here, however it is a good guide to how most people may prefer their sketch., Even though it's a wolf you could use colors like blues and greens to add shading, since it is an anime wolf after all.,

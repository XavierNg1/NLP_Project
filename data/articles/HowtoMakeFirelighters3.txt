 Press one open end of a cardboard toilet paper tube closed, keeping the edge closed with one or two staples.


The cardboard should catch fire and burn well enough, so you do not need to insert a separate wick into this firelighter.
If you do not have a toilet paper tube, you could cut a cardboard paper towel core into two or three pieces and use that, instead.
 Stuff dryer lint or a similar material into the remaining opening of the tub. Fill most of the tube, leaving only 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of empty space at the top of the tube.


Dryer lint works very well as kindling because it is dry and light. It is not your only option, though. You could use sawdust, wood shavings, shredded paper, or bits of crushed and broken cork, instead.
 Slowly pour melted candle wax into the tube, using just enough to cover the contents inside.


Note that it may be easier and safer if you prop the tube upright in between two cement blocks or similarly heavy, non-flammable objects as you pour the wax.. You could even use a vice to hold the tube in place. Do not hold the tube with your hands.
 Keep the tube standing upright and undisturbed for 30 minutes or so, or until the wax completely cools and sets in place.


You should be able to tell when the wax is ready simply by peeking inside the tube. The wax should appear completely solid. If you want to double check, gently squeeze the sides of the cardboard tube. They should feel cool and solid.
 Press the remaining open end of the tube together. Keep the end sealed by stapling it in place.
 The firelighter should work well enough as it is, but if you want to cardboard to burn for a longer period of time, soak entire thing in a bit of liquid paraffin for 30 seconds.


Remove the firelighter from the paraffin and let it dry.
 Keep the cardboard firelighter in an airtight plastic container until you are ready to use it.

 It is very important when trying to look confident to smile! It opens you up to other people, making you more approachable, and releases hormones that make YOU feel better. Even if you don't feel like smiling try it and it may well stick.;
, It is something that makes a huge impact on how others perceive you. What do you think when someone is walking all hunched over? Now think of someone walking tall with head up. See the difference? Just by standing straighter you can start making a dramatic difference.
 Don't just stare. But catch other peoples eye, look at them when speaking to them, again not staring or you will just scare people. Show them you are not afraid of them. Be daring!

, The amount of people I know who put themselves down every time someone compliments them is truly astounding. As soon as someone puts themselves down the other person will begin noticing it too! Its inevitable. Next time someone compliments you, respond positively, and soon you will start being more confident in yourself and looking more confident to others.
 Doesn't all have to be looks, though some always help. Could be your smile, your hair, your attitude, your determination... etc, you get the point.
 Have that long luxurious shower you have been craving since last weekend, do that pedicure you have wanted to do since last week, shave those legs you have been telling yourself can wait. Every last modification can make the world of difference to how you act and to how you feel. And the better you feel about yourself, the better other people will feel about you.
 You may not feel confident, you may have woken up with a bad hair day, with that awful zit the size of a mountain or shaved off eyebrow from last nights rave. But either way, get up. Look in the mirror. Tell yourself 'you are gorgeous' and believe it! The more you say it the more you will believe it. And if you believe it, so will everybody else.

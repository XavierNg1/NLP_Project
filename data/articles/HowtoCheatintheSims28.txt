, Make another family, including a toddler that looks like your other sim/sims. Then abuse it. Tip: (Do not make ANY of the sims in the family have a family aspiration.)

 You must be careful with this cheat, do not leave it on your game too long because it has been known to cause crashes. The first thing you want to do is bring up the cheat box and enter boolProp TestingCheatsEnabled true. Then if you click the sim you would like to get pregnant and while holding shift you will be able to click the option spawn. Once you click spawn continue clicking more till you see an option that says to generate a genetic combination with and choose the other member. To turn off the bool prop change the true to false.

 To play this, bar the third fret (or any fret now that you know how barre chords work), starting from the fifth string (A string). Place your index finger across all the stings except the low E. To play a major chord in this form, use your ring finger to barre the D, G, and B strings on the fifth fret. This is a C major.

, Just like the other types of barre chords, you can start on the D string as the root. This is a less challenging barre chord, but a useful one. Practice a simple, funky sounding chord by barring the D string to the high E string, without strumming the E or A strings.

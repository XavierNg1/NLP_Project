 The SOW is usually created after the core contract negotiations are completed but before any work on a project begins. Sometimes, however (particularly with time-sensitive projects), negotiations may continue after the work has begun and the SOW is not finalized until the project is well underway.;
, There is not a single standard SOW as different industries and projects have different deliverables and workflow. A good SOW is a customized SOW.
 While the original SOW itself usually is not revised, a separate side agreement called a Change Order typically is used to modify the SOW’s terms. It is a good idea to include a blank Change Order form with the SOW. Keep in mind, Change Orders can increase the project’s cost. A well-written SOW can help to reduce the need for a Change Order. No client wants to be in a position where his or her specific expectations are left undocumented, which can lead to delays, an increase in total cost, or dissatisfaction.

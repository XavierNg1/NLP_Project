 If your vehicle has a carburetor (a device that mixes air and fuel) and it will not start, check the choke. If your choke is closed when you try to turn the vehicle over, open it. If it was open when you try to turn the vehicle over, close it.Adjusting the choke is also a good idea when your car has a carburetor and starts, but then turns off.
If you cannot locate your choke, consult your vehicle’s user manual.
 If your car has a hard time starting on rainy days, look inside the distributor cap. If you see moisture inside the distributor cap, turn the cap upside down and spray it with mechanic’s solvent (or, if you have a bottle of solvent rather than a spray can, pour some of the solvent into the cap). Swish the solvent around, then pour it out. Use a clean rag to wipe out any additional solvent before replacing the cap.The distributor cap is a small cover that protects your car’s distributor.
 If you don’t even hear a sputter when you turn the ignition, the terminal cables to the battery are probably not connected properly. If the terminal connections look corroded, jam a screwdriver between the connector and the terminal post. Twist the screwdriver to tighten the connection. Try the engine. If it starts, clean or replace the battery cables.When adjusting the connector and terminal post, use a screwdriver with an insulated or wooden handle.

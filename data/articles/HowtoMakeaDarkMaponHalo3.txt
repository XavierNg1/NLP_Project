 You will not be able to edit lighting effects on shipped or Heroic map packs. To bring up the item menu, go into editor mode and press the X button on your Xbox 360 controller.;
, It will be number 4 of the 7 categories. You will need to purchase a few lighting effects in order to make your map darker.
 You have reached the lighting effects. There are six lighting effects in total: Fx, Nova, Fx, Pen and Ink, Fx, Olde Timey, Fx, Colorblind, Fx, Gloomy, Fx, Juicy. Each has their own effect on the lighting, but combined, some can make your map much darker.
 Although you might assume Gloomy will give you the best effect, and it indeed does darken your map, adding Olde Timey and Juicy to it will make your map substantially darker. Note however that Fx, Juicy has a side effect which makes orange colour stand out - you might want this for a radiation-like effect, or you can remove it all together, although the sepia tone of the Fx, Olde Timey will really stand out if you do.
 Although you might want some pieces of light in your map such as energy doors or fusion coils, removing them completely will make your map even darker.

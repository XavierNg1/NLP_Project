 Weight training, unlike cardio exercises, tones the muscles under your skin and causes it to look more taught. This can greatly reduce the appearance of cellulite.


Buy free weights and perform exercises meant to tone your thighs, buttocks, and abs. If you have cellulite on your arms, perform arm exercises as well.
Join a gym and work with a trainer to increase the amount of weight you lift over time. Contrary to common belief, lifting heavier weights fewer times, rather than doing a lot of reps with lighter weights, is better for building muscle.
 Pairing weight training with exercises that get your heart pumping leads to the production of lean muscle mass, which will cause your thighs and buttocks to look smoother over time.Try the following exercises after doing a light warmup:


Do outdoor sprints. Measure out a distance of 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km) on your street or at a nearby park. Sprint that distance, take a 20-second break, sprint it again, and repeat for a total of 4 sprints. As you improve, add more sprints to your workout.
Sprint on your treadmill. If you work out indoors, use a faster setting on your treadmill to sprint for about 3 minutes. Increase the speed as you improve over time.
Do bike sprints. Using either your bicycle or a stationary bike, ride as fast as you can uphill for for a few minutes.

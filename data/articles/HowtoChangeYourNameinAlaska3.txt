 You must choose carefully the last name you wish to use following a divorce or dissolution of marriage. This is important because the rules applicable to you will change depending on whether you wish to retain your married name, restore your name to your prior name, or adopt a new name.
 Request your change of name by writing your new name in the appropriate spaces in the petition accompanying your divorce or dissolution proceedings. The rules applicable to name changes in divorce and dissolution proceedings differ depending on whether you are restoring your name to a prior name or adopting a new name.


If you are changing your name back to a prior name, then there is no further action required on your part. The courts are empowered to change your name back to a prior name as part of divorce or dissolution proceedings.If you select this option, then the courtâ€™s judgment will serve as evidence of your name change.
If you wish to change your name to a new name after a divorce or dissolution, then request from the court an Application or Report of Name Change.. Note that doing so will delay your divorce or dissolution hearing, as this requires attending a hearing and involves potential notice requirements similar to the requirements of changing your name through a court order as described above., As in the case of a certified marriage certificate, a divorce or dissolution judgment is accepted as evidence of your name change by the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV), and other government agencies and private institutions with whom you may wish to change your name. Visit these agencies and institutions and take your divorce or dissolution judgment with you in order to change your name in their records. Failure to do so may result in confusion and problems in the future.

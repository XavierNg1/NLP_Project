 There's a good chance that they'll ask you to sing a pre-requested song from the show, maybe you'll be asked to sing whatever shows your best abilities. For most shows, it's the exact opposite. Whatever you're asked to do, follow the requirements.
 For females, a soprano hits the highest notes (Common), a mezzo hits the middle notes (uncommon), and altos hit the lowest notes (Relatively uncommon). Some people have very limited ranges, and some women can hit everything from a low C# to a high C#. For males, tenors hit the highest notes, baritones hit the middle notes, basses hit the lowest notes, and, rarest of all, countertenors can reach well into a female range. When determining your voice range, choose whatever feels the most comfortable for you to sing loudly (belt/chest voice) without hurting yourself. Often times, a skilled voice teacher can help you analyze what your voice part is.
 Also, if you're not a music buff and are still unsure about if you and the character have compatible voice parts, try to sing the songs from the production online with a recording in the same key and see if you can hit all of the notes in the same way that the original singer did. And, even if you can't hit that low G in that same rich quality as the original Broadway singer did, don't get discouraged- This could be partially because of range or partially because of a lack of training in that area.
 That is considered theatrical suicide and shows desperation for a certain role, which just shows the directors that you have a lack of experience. Other unspoken no-nos are Happy Birthday, any nursery rhymes, and rap (unless your desired character has songs that resemble works by Nicki Minaj or Eminem).
 Also, don't skimp on acting in the song! It is recommended that you do not use props, however.

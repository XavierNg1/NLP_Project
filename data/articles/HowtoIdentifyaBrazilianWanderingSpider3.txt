 If you live in the Brazilian wandering spider’s habitat, wear a long-sleeved shirt, hat, long pants tucked into your socks, and gloves whenever you’re doing spring cleaning in the garage or near the woodpile. It’s also a good idea to wear this gear when you’re working in attics, crawl spaces, or unfinished basements., These spiders may hide in the folds of your clothes, and boots and gloves make particularly cozy sleeping spots. Gently shake these items out before you put them on. Avoid vigorously shaking them, because you don’t want to anger or scare any hidden spiders.If a spider falls out, don’t panic. Back away slowly and leave the area.
 Turn on the lights. If you can’t do that, bring a flashlight and shine it into any corners and behind boxes or piles of stuff., The best way to avoid getting bitten in your home is to keep the spiders from getting in! Check all your screens and doors for holes, tears, or big spaces that could allow spiders to crawl through. Replace anything that’s loose or broken.You can also spray bug and spider repellant around doors and windows to ward off creepy crawlies.
 Since woodpiles are perfect hiding places for these spiders, avoid creating a spider home right next to your home. Store wood and brush in your yard and always be careful when you move any of it.

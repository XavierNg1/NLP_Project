 Sometimes, you need to provide a more precise location than broad lines of latitude and longitude. Lines of latitude and longitude can be broken down by minutes and seconds. However, you must decipher the broad lines of latitude and longitude. Find which lines of latitude and longitude a location falls along.For example, say your location falls on the latitude line 15°N and the longitude line 30°E.
 The space between each line of latitude and longitude is divided into one degree. This degree can be further divided into minutes. Imagine there are 60 even minutes separating each line of latitude and longitude. You can find maps online that will help you pinpoint the precise number of minutes your location falls along between each line of latitude or longitude. An apostrophe should be used to indicate the number of minutes between lines.For example, if you find there are 23 minutes between the latitude lines, you would write this as "23'".
 Minutes are further divided into intervals of seconds. There are 60 seconds between each minute. Again, an online map can help you identify the precise number of seconds between each minute. A quotation mark is used to indicate the number of seconds.For example, if there are 15 seconds between the minutes in your longitude line, you would write "15"".
 After finding the precise coordinates, in seconds and minutes, for your lines of latitude and longitude, write them out in the correct order. Start with your line of latitude, writing the degrees, then the seconds, then the minutes. Then, add the North or South as the direction. Then, write a comma followed by your line of longitude in degrees, then minutes, then seconds. Then, add East or West as the direction.For example, say you have a line of latitude at 15°N, 24 minutes, and 15 seconds. You have a line of latitude at 30°E, 10 minutes, and 3 seconds.
This line of latitude and longitude would be written as, "15°24'15"N, 30°E10'3"".

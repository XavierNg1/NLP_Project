 You'll have to start finding the area for complex shapes by breaking the shape down into geometric shapes, like those discussed above. On homework assignments, it will probably be pretty clear cut what those shapes should be, but in the real world, you might need to break an area up into a lot of shapes in order to get really accurate.


A good place to start is by looking for right angles and parallel lines. These serve as the basis of many shapes.
 Use the instructions above to find the area of the different shapes you find.
 Add the resulting areas together in order to get the total area for your shape.
 There are other tricks you can try too, depending on the shape. You can also try adding imaginary space in order to make the shape a standard geometric shape, and then subtracting the area of that imaginary space after you get your result, for example.

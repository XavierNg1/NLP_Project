 This form is available online, via the Department of Health, Vital Records bureau website.You can also acquire the form in person at the Health Department building in Honolulu, but by that point you might as well just make your request in person at the window in Room 103.
Be prepared to provide information such as your name, address, and phone number; the name on the birth certificate; date and place (city and island) of birth; full names of both parents; and reason for requesting the copy.
 Unlike some other states, Hawaii does not indicate any alternative ID options should you not have a photo ID of this sort (driver's license, passport, etc.).


Contact the Vital Records bureau directly to discuss your options if you do not have a valid photo ID (808-586-4539 or 808-586-4542 during business hours).
While not explicitly indicated, it is probably wise to photocopy both the front and back of your ID card.
Also make sure it is a clear copy. Better safe than sorry.
 Address payment to the Hawaii State Department of Health. Personal checks, cash, and credit card numbers are not accepted by mail.


The cost is $10 plus a $2.50 "portal administration fee" for a total of $12.50. Additional copies are $4 apiece.
It is worth repeating (as it is several times on the state website) that personal checks are not accepted, since this is likely the presumed form of payment for such a mail order request.
 The stated turnaround time is 6-8 weeks.Mail your packet to:


Hawaii State Department of Health, Office of Health Status Monitoring, Vital Records Issuance Section, P.O. Box 3378, Honolulu, HI 96801
To recap, your packet should include: the completed, signed application form; a photocopy of your government-issued photo ID; and your payment (by cashier's check, certified check, or money order).

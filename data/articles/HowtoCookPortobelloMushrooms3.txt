 Use a damp or dry cloth to wipe your mushrooms clean. Remove the stems. You can discard the stems or chop them up and cook them.


To remove stems, hold the cap of the mushroom in your dominant hand and gently twist the stem with your other hand.
You can scrape out the gills with a spoon if you prefer.
 Place your mushrooms on a cutting board and slice them with a sharp knife. Aim for about 1/4 inch slices.


Always slice away from your hand and fingers.
 Heat your skillet on medium heat and sauté 1 minced garlic clove in 1/4 cup olive oil until garlic is tender. Add parsley.
 Drop your sliced mushrooms into the pan for 3 to 5 minutes, turning once. Dust mushrooms with 1/4 cup parsley, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.


Mushrooms are cooked when they are tender and browned.
 Enjoy immediately as an entrée or side dish.

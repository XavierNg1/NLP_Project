Some saline laxatives include Fleet Phospho-Soda, Milk of Magnesia, lactose, and Miralax. These laxatives don't irritate the colons or cause tolerance like stimulant laxatives can.
 Some stimulant laxatives, such as Ex-Lax, can also help relieve constipation. However, these should only be used in a pinch, and for no longer than two weeks without consulting your doctor. Regular use of laxatives can actually cause tolerance, weaken your bones, and may even cause constipation., Painkillers, especially narcotic ones such as hydrocodone (Vicodin, Lorcet, Norco) and oxycodone (Percocet and Oxycontin), can cause constipation. Though you shouldn't stop taking painkillers just to relieve your constipation if you really need them, talk to a doctor about alternatives.

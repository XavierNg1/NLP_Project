 It can be made from fabric, wool, silk, etc. just as long as the material is flexible (stretchy) and amenable to being twisted around during wearing.
 Use matching thread and keep the stitching as invisible as possible; some people recommend twisting the ends before stitching to help when looping the scarf around your neck; you may wish to experiment. Always turn the edge inward when stitching, to keep it neat.


The really lazy method: If the scarf is long enough, just tie a knot to create the loop. This can be done anywhere, anytime, making it an ideal fix when you're caught on a windy street or beach and need to keep the scarf tightly wrapped on!

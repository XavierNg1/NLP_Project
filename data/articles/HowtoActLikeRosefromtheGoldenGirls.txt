 Everyone has a story, especially Rose! Her stories usually start with, "Back in St. Olaf..." What's your story? Just tell stories that made you laugh, or have special meanings. Share them at the weirdest times, and don't let anyone tell you to stop!;
, Do things that you want to do, don't let anything get you down! Rose is so light-hearted , it's admirable! How about doing something that gets your heart racing? Ever tried sky-diving? Hang-gliding? Anything you would never normally do!

, Rose always does! At your school, at PTAs anywhere! Run for president! It's OK if you don't make it, Rose has never won any of her 7 times. But, as long as you're doing something good for the community, you'll be on the right track!

, Rose lives with three other hilarious old ladies, and they are together for the end! Don't not be yourself, because friends will only like you for who you are. When you're old enough, try to get your friends to come and buy a house where all of them and you can live! It will be cheaper, and fun! Another win-win situation!

, Rose is probably the nicest of the 4, and it shows. This can be a really easy step, or a really hard one depending on how nice you are already. Just remember that people are people, no matter how they act.
 When they say they mean it, they mean it. You need to have full trust for all your friends. And more times than not, they won't be lying. If they are lying, discuss the motive for lying, and, if it's reasonable, learn to forgive and forget.

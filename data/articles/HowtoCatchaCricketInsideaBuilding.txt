 In order to do this you will need a quiet house. Carefully go from room to room listening for the characteristic chirping. Crickets can usually be found underneath furniture or appliances and in closets. If, however, you suddenly turn the lights on in a previously dark room they may be out in the open.;
, A large, clear drinking glass is preferable, so that the rim can safely enclose the cricket without out touching any antennae.
 If they are underneath something, you may have to rearrange furniture or shock them out. Try flourishing a long, thin object or brandishing a flashlight in the area where the cricket is hiding. Unfortunately, you will have lost the element of surprise after that.
, If you make any jerky movements, the cricket will jump three to four feet depending on its size, so steady the hand and move down slowly until the cricket is trapped.
 Slide the glass over the paper.

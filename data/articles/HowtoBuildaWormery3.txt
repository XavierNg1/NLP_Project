 Keep the worms’ environment moist, not wet or dry. Don’t allow it to get cold or too hot. The temperature of your wormery should stay between 55 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8 to 25 degrees Celsius).If the wormery is too wet and starts to smell, take everything out and thoroughly mix it with brown material before returning it to the container.
If the wormery stays too dry, remove the contents, mix them with some water and green material, and return it to the container.
 Feed the worms by adding kitchen waste to the top, such as uncooked fruit, coffee grounds, tea leaves and vegetable peelings.Although worms can process just about anything that’s decomposable, there are certain items that aren’t advisable to add. Worms can die from overfeeding, so make sure that you only add waste when the previous waste has been composted. However you should check the container regularly, since they’ll die from not enough food as well. As a rule of thumb, try checking every day or every other day.Use a variety of food for your worms rather than the same thing over and over. The pieces you add should be small. If you give them garden waste, do so sparingly (a few annual weeds here and there).
Don’t give your worms meat, fish, dairy products, seeds, citrus peel, garlic and onions. Also avoid fatty foods like peanut butter or mayonnaise.
 Since the wormery needs to be ventilated, the openings give fruit flies a way to get in. Feed your worms by digging a small trench in the wormery and adding the scraps. Then cover the scraps with an inch or so of bedding. This will prevent fruit flies as well as odors., About every three months, move the top bedding to the side and add fresh bedding. Wait about two weeks, and the worms will have moved over into the new bedding. You can then scoop out their castings with the old bedding.You can work worm castings and their old bedding into your garden as fertilizer.

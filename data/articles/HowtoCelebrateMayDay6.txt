 May eve is said to be a time when the spirit world and the physical world are close together. Folk divination methods can be done for fun in the evening, for example peeling an apple with a knife, so that the peel stays in one piece. Then cut the apple in half and eat half of it with your back to a mirror. Throw the other half over your left shoulder and quickly turn to face the mirror. It is said to then reveal your future partners face looking over your shoulder.


Alternatively, you can go out at dusk and gather nine flowers (each of a different type). Tie them up with a string and place them under your pillow. It is believed to reveal your future mate in your dreams.
 Wearing the wreath on your head past midnight on May eve can attract good luck and keep away mischievous fairies.

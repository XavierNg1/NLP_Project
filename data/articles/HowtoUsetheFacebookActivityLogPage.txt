 Open up your Facebook Timeline page, and click the "View Activity Log" to open this log file page.;
, The activity log will list all actions you have taken with Facebook. Whether it's posting a new status update, liking a page, taking an action you've taken with another service or whatever not, it's all going to be here on this page.
 Facebook will help you group them according to their date.
 It will list something like "(user's name) posted something (via service)" or "(user's name) just updated his/her status" or something to that effect.
 This is the column to the right of the overall-explanatory column.
 Look for a column/button that explains which type of group of people you'd like to share the status with. Open it up, it'll become a drop-down and select a different group of people (if you'd like to change it).


Routinely check some of these listings, to make sure they aren't shared with people you'd rather not show these posts to.
 With a simple click, you can allow or hide these posts from your profile, or if you are courageous enough, you can even highlight them and make an individual post "stand out" when people view them to see what you feel is super-important. You can also delete them from this page.

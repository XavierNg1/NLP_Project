 Apply the lotion to any area where your clothes stick to your skin.









By moisturizing your skin, you remove dryness that would otherwise attract the highly-charged item of clothing.
You can apply the lotion to your skin directly. Alternatively, you could rub a small amount on your hands and lightly run your hands over your skin to add a small amount of moisture.
Also rub lotion over your hands before removing laundry from the dryer or folding your clothes. Doing so prevents excess electrical charge from transferring to your dry hands and to the fabric.
 Use silicone-based conditioner and styling products after you wash your hair.









The silicone in these products coats each strand of hair, creating a barrier that neutralizes electrical charges. With the electrical charge neutralized, static is kept in check.

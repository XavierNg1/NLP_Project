 Expect peridot to come in various shades of green. Visit a respectable jeweler to browse a number of samples, all at once. Familiarize yourself with the different shades that it comes in, from olive to rich green to slightly yellowed.The iron content in each gem determines its color. The deeper the green, the more iron is present.;
, Although peridot comes in a variety of shades, make sure the shade of each gem is consistent throughout its body. Inspect all sides of loose stones to see if they match each other in color. With jewelry, check all exposed sides.If possible, view it under different sources and levels of light, as well. Expect the gemâ€™s color to remain consistent regardless of changes in lighting.
 This is a matter of taste, of course, so go with your gut. However, bear a few things in mind. Expect many people to consider green gems free of any other tints to be the finest specimens.At the same time, be aware that imitations are usually free of these tints as well.Imitations include apatite, green garnets, green sinhalite, green tourmaline, green zircon, and moldavites.
If authenticity is an issue, go with a gem with a yellowish tint, since this never occurs in imitations.

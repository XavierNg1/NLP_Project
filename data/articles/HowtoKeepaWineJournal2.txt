 One of the most enjoyable aspects of keeping a wine journal is being able to save the label from each bottle. Wine labels can usually be removed by baking the bottle in the oven for a bit and then peeling the label away with a razor blade.
 At the top of each page, you'll want to record the wine's vineyard, vintage, and grape varieties. These are the most important pieces of information if you'll want to hunt the same wine down later for a second tasting.
 You may also want to record the date that you sampled the wine and with whom you tasted it. This will allow you to organize the wine journal chronologically and can help you remember a certain wine based on where and when you consumed it.
 Of course, this is the chief reason to keep a wine journal. Record any thoughts on the wine's bouquet, mouthfeel, taste, finish, and appearance. If the flavor reminds you of another wine, make a note of that association. Most importantly, take notes on whether or not you enjoyed the wine.

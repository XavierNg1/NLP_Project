 Preferably one that can close or has some clasp to control loose papers. Carry this notebook with you anywhere because you never know what could spark your inspiration. And if possible get that piece of inspiration somehow into your notebook. Through a picture, pamphlet, etc. Label sections and for easy navigation either you stick on tabs or sticky notes.;
, Don't make it too short but don't write out the entire book either. If you have some ideas or details make sure to jot them down in a section of your notebook.
 It might seem like homework at the end of the day but push through. Or if you really feel helpless about writing that day go somewhere with lots of inspiration for your specific story. For example if you are writing a book about skaters go to a skate park. This feels your brain with ideas and great notes to add later on. But be sure to write it down, photograph it or somehow find a way to be able to go back to the info you find that day.
 Then on the next day type up that chapter but also use this as a form of editing. So be careful not to always type word for word. If you don't specifically like how something sounds change it, change it, change it.
 Ask them to get a peek at and see how they like it. Every comment about your book is vital to you being published.
 Then read it like you were reading it for the first time. Sometimes you may think something is obvious when it truly is not apparent to the reader.
 Since a few missed place comas and a bunch of boring words could truly be ruining your story.

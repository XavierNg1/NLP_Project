 Find a sunny spot in your garden and dig a hole large enough to accommodate the seedling or plant. Use a gardening fork to gently dig up some soil at the base of the hole and rake a handful of compost into it. Gently insert plant and fill the space around it with an even mixture of soil and compost.Plant chilli plants at least 18 inches (45 cm) apart from any other plants to ensure that they will have adequate room to grow.
 In a warm, sunny climate, water your chilli plant every day to keep it hydrated. Avoid over-watering by making sure that the soil is moist, but not swampy. Feed plants with a general purpose liquid fertilizer (available at gardening centers) every two weeks., Chilli plants should only be transplanted outdoors in warm climates or places with very long summer seasons. In the latter case, it is best to transfer them outdoors in June. Purchase fleece or a gardening cloche (i.e. a protective dome cover that goes over the plant and is burrowed into the soil around it) to cover plants in case of unseasonallyÂ  cold weather.

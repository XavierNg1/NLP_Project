 Team with a white tank or a tank in a complementary color. If you are uncomfortable with wearing tanks and short skirts, opt for cap sleeves and bright tights under the skirt. Glam up your outfit with a wide belt cinched at the waist. You can even wear a short dress that billows out slightly from the waist and has an asymmetric hemline.;
, Striped leggings look amazing.
 Choose shoes such as ballet flats, in fresh colors such as yellow, green or blue. Moccasins, Mary Jane pumps, or barefoot will have the same effect.
 If needed, you can pin it onto your hair.
 Flip the layers, and have bangs to one side. You could even think about dyeing your hair, or parts of it, white blond if it goes with your skin tone or adding other colors such as electric blue streaks to your hair. Other dramatic colors also work well,, including things like pitch black and rusty red. Remember: always think of your skin tone before dyeing.
, You have two options so far as makeup goes. You could keep your makeup fairly simple- fresh, dewy skin, a hint of blush, some pale lip gloss and bright eyes is more than enough. Or you could go crazy with the eyeliner and give off a frou-frou pixie look. You could also add a little glitter on your cheeks and chest to add more of an effect of a pixie. This would work best with both options.
 For example, you could wear daisy earrings or a butterfly pendant.
 If it's for a dress up event, consider attaching a pair of wings to the back of your dress. Choose good quality wings to avoid looking costume-like.

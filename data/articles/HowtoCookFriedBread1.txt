 Fried bread is almost always eaten with one or more other fried foods, as part of an English breakfast. This often includes eggs, English bacon, sausage, sliced tomatoes, mushrooms, and baked beans. Fry them all in the same pan before you start your bread.


If cooking all of the above, start the sausages first, the mushrooms a couple minutes later, then the other ingredients a few minutes later. Finish with the fried eggs.;
, Depending on how much meat and butter you used in the fry-up, you might already have enough fat in the pan. But let's be honest: caloric introspection has no place when frying bread. Add a small knob of butter, a splash of flavorful vegetable oil or, more traditionally, bacon drippings or lard.
 Turn the stove on medium-high until the oil shimmers and gives off heat. A hot pan will keep the bread crisp, instead of weighed down by soggy grease.
 Slightly stale white bread is perfect, as the dry slice will soak up the flavorful oil more quickly. Save that fresh loaf of whole grain for the people who want toast instead.


Slice the bread into triangles if you have a small pan.
 A small sprinkle of salt and a quick turn of the pepper mill will add some flavor, but this isn't mandatory. Cayenne pepper is another option for people who enjoy spice with their breakfast.
 If the pan is hot and oily enough, you'll only need a few seconds on each side to make the bread crisp, golden brown, and full of the flavors of the fried meal. If your pan was too cold and not sizzling, you may need to fry the bread for 15â€“30 seconds, but pull it out before it gets too soggy.

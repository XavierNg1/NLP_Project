, It is unusual for loose blades to cause a squeak, but possible in some instances. Also check that the light bulbs are securely in place; they can rattle around in their sockets.
 The weight of this dust can create an out of balance situation which can put unequal pressure on the fan motor bearings, causing them to squeak, and wear out prematurely, as well.
 Some light kits come with a rubber band-like accessory that is wrapped around the "neck" of the glove to isolate it from the metal flange, to prevent squeaking if the unit is slightly out of balance or wobbles.
 These are knurled headed screws which should only be tightened finger tight; excess pressure can cause the glass to break if too much force is applied.
 If not, proceed to the next troubleshooting steps.
 This can be done with a "Balancing Kit" sold at home centers and electrical supply stores. These kits have a weighted, self-adhesive material similar to very thick tape that is attached to the top of the fan blades. Follow package instructions, or if you are very patient, attach small pieces of these weights by trial and error to balance your blades.
 If not, there is a possibility the bearings in the fan motor are wearing out, and this can cause a fan motor to overheat and "short out". This, in turn, can be a serious fire hazard. Most ceiling fans come with sealed bearings which cannot be lubricated, but if someone really wanted to salvage the fan, you may be able to disassemble the motor and use a light machine oil on the bearings if you can get access to them.

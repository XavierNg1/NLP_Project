 Deboning a frozen or partially-frozen chicken breast is very difficult. Make sure your chicken breast is entirely thawed before beginning to de-bone. You can thaw your chicken by putting it in the refrigerator overnight, putting it in a bowl of water, or using your microwave's defrost setting.
 Make sure the cutting board is clean and that the chicken breast doesn’t have wings or leg meat attached to it. If it does, cut it off.
 This will prepare it for splitting and help you find the breastbone quickly. Use a chef’s knife to get the cleanest cuts.
 Slide your fingers into the cut you made and pull the skin off the entire chicken breast. You should be able to simply pull it off by hand, but cutting is okay too., Look inside the cut to locate the breastbone. Most chicken breasts will have only one bone, which runs lengthwise down the middle of the chicken breast. Sometimes the ribs will still be attached, but you can ignore them--the chicken will come right off the ribs when you cut it away from the bone.
 Slide your knife into the cut you already made so it’s between the meat and the breastbone. Using a scraping motion with the knife, cut along the bone so that the meat separates from it.
 Repeat the same scraping motion along the other side of the breastbone. If any part of the chicken is still attached to the breast, pull or cut it off. You now have two boneless, skinless chicken breast halves!







, If there is any extra skin, fat, tendons, or cartilage remaining on your chicken breast, cut it off. You can throw them away, or keep them along with the bones for homemade chicken stock.

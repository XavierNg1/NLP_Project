 Big shiny eyes are one part that will pull the costume together. If you have brown eyes already, you probably don’t need to wear contacts. Even so, contacts can make your eyes appear larger and shinier, which is great for the look.If you don’t want to spend the money or go to the hassle of contacts, your cosplay can still look great even without brown eyes. Don’t stress too much about that part.
 Anime characters have clear and blemish free skin, but most people don’t. Use some pale concealer, liquid foundation, or beauty balm to cover your face in an even, smooth coat. Applying powder on top of that will help set everything.
 You probably won’t dye your eyebrows even if you dye your hair, and Erza has very thin, straight eyebrows. If you want to pluck them into shape, you can, but otherwise covering them with concealer will help.


Then you can mix red and black eyeshadow to draw nice straight eyebrows.
This is another aspect of the costume that is not absolutely vital, but it will create a more thorough Erza look.
 You can’t change your nose to fit the thin, long look that Erza has, but you can use makeup to affect the way your nose looks. This is a fairly advanced makeup technique, so it may take some time.You don’t need to have fancy, expensive makeup, but you may need to practice for a while to get the look just right.
Check out these techniques to contour your nose.
 Long, full lashes are the perfect finish for your Erza look. Use a brush that is for lengthening lashes and don’t be afraid to apply 2 coats for a thick look. You can also curl them before you apply mascara if you want to.

 Mixed numbers are part whole number and part fraction, such as 24/5. There are two steps to finding the reciprocal of a mixed number, explained below.
 Remember, the number 1 can always be written as (number)/(the same number), and fractions with the same denominator (lower number) can be added together. Here's an example with 24/5:


24/5

= 1 + 1 + 4/5

= 5/5 + 5/5 + 4/5

= (5+5+4)/5

= 14/5.
 Once the number is written entirely as a fraction, you can find the reciprocal just like you would with any fraction: by flipping it.


In the example above, the reciprocal of 14/5 is 5/14.

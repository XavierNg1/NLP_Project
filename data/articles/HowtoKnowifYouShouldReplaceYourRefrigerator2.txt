 Another cause of condensation or frost may be a crack in the interior shell of your refrigerator. These cracks will allow cold air to escape and are extremely hard to repair. If your refrigerator is still under warranty, contact the retailer or manufacturer to see about getting a replacement.It may be worth contacting an appliance repair professional before deciding to replace the fridge, but cracks in the shell usually mean the appliance will need to be replaced.
 If water is collecting on any surface of your fridge, including the exterior, this may be a sign that the door seal is no longer airtight. Excessive frost in the freezer or on the exterior of the fridge may also indicate a faulty seal.Look at the rubber gasket all the way around the door to ensure it hasn't come loose somewhere. If so, you may be able to push it back in.
Test the seal in multiple spots by closing the door onto a piece of paper money. Try to pull the bill out of the door slowly. If it easily slides out, you may be able to fix the fridge by replacing the rubber gasket that runs around the edge of the door.
 You may be able to replace your refrigerator's seal yourself. You can likely get a kit that contains the materials necessary to do so from your local hardware store or an online retailer.Be sure any kit you purchase is compatible with your fridge. You may have to order a special kit from the refrigerator's manufacturer.
Kits to replace the gasket on most refrigerators cost about $50.

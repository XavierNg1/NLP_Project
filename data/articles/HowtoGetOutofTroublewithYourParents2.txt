 Your sister or brother might tease you or do annoying things. If you get in a fight, you might get into trouble with your parents. Chances are, your sibling is trying to get your attention or they are bored. If you ignore the behavior, they will probably stop and go onto a different activity. This keeps you from fighting and keeps you out of trouble with your parents., Sometimes, you might be treated unfairly by your parents, and your sibling might get better treatment. They might get to stay up later or they might get to watch a movie that you don’t get to watch. Instead of getting mad and getting into a fight, show your maturity by accepting that you don’t always get what you want and that you can handle it. This will keep you out of fights with your parents.
 If your sibling is really testing you or getting into your stuff too much, talk calmly with your parents. Explain to them that you’re trying to be patient with your sibling but you also need your own space and privacy. Your parents will value your maturity.
 Oftentimes, your sibling may be annoying you to get your attention. Find a time when you can do something together, like going for a walk or seeing a movie together.

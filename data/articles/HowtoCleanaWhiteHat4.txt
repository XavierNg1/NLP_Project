 For cotton and polyester hats, combine one cup (250 mL) of hydrogen peroxide, one tablespoon of dish liquid, and one scoop of a product like Oxi Clean White Revive to a gallon of warm water. For a wool hat, add one ounce of a detergent specially designed for wool like Woolite to a gallon of cool water.
 Before you begin cleaning the spot, you will want to wet it with water. If you are cleaning a cotton or polyester hat, use warm water. For a wool hat, use cool water.
 Dip the toothbrush in the solution of cleaning supplies and water. Then gently scrub the stain with an old, soft toothbrush. If you are worried about pilling your hat, you can massage the cleaning solution in with your fingers.
 Once you scrub the stain, rinse the area with cool water. Make sure you remove all the cleaning solution from the hat. Air dry the hat in the sun, if possible, or inside your house.

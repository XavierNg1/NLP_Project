 When you're on a plane, choose an aisle seat near one of the restrooms. On a bus, call ahead to make sure your bus will have a restroom; when on the bus, pick a seat near the back, also on the aisle. Try to always be as close to the bathroom as you can to avoid accidents.You can request one of these seats on a plane when booking by phone. Additionally, many airlines let you look at the flight beforehand and switch seats.If you somehow end up away from the bathroom, you should discreetly inform a flight attendant about your health issue and ask if you can switch seats in order to be closer to the restroom.
 It can also help to tell your flight attendant about your condition. You don't need to be explicit, but you can say you have a medical condition that sometimes makes going to the bathroom urgent. That way, if you do run into a problem (such as a long line), the attendant can try to help., This advice is good for traveling, period. When packing for a plane trip, it's a good idea to always carry a spare change of clothes with you in your carry-on luggage. If your luggage is lost, you still have a change of clothes, which you may need.In addition, if you have a problem on the plane, you have something to change into. If possible, keep these with you even when you get off the plane, as you may run into trouble later.

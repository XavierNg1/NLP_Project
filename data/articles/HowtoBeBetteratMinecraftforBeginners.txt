 It might seem boring, but if you try doing something too advanced, it could be so hard that you quit. Breaking and placing blocks, killing mobs, and running around might seem simple, but the skills might help you later on, especially when done in certain ways.


Try learning about redstone circuitry. It can be used for many useful purposes.
Try spawning mobs in creative mode and switching to survival to fight them.

Don't fight just one type of mob! There are a lot of them out there.


Try different building techniques. Minecraft isn't just for survival- it's a place to create things too.;
,


Try finding a server that is open to newcomers, or especially for newcomers.
 If they're a friend that lives near you, you can have them overage play a LAN world. If they're a sibling who lives with you, you can also play a LAN world.


If the friend or sibling lives far away, try a video chat.
 If you are better at building than fighting mobs and surviving, try creative mode. You won't have to survive and you can just build.
 If you don't like using "W, A, S, D", maybe using the arrow keys is better for you. If you press "Escape" then "Options" and "Controls", you can change the controls. There are many different controls that you can edit to your likes!

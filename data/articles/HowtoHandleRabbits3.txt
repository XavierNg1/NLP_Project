 Your bunny is more likely to get accustomed to human contact if it is socialized from an early age. If it isn’t held a lot at an early age, it might never take to being held.


Some rabbits never will become comfortable with being held., Your bunny will be less nervous if you don’t pick them up too high in the air. You should start by squatting close to the ground and holding your rabbit in your arms, just a foot or two off the ground. As your bunny becomes better socialized, you can try to stand up normally with your bunny.This also makes it less likely that your rabbit will hurt itself if it jumps out of your arms.
 If you cover your rabbit’s eyes with a towel or your arm, this can calm it down. This is a good way to start socializing your bunny. Be careful, however, that you don’t obstruct the rabbit’s breathing., Any bad experiences with humans can reverse your work to socialize the bunny. Be careful about allowing children or strangers to hold the rabbit. If they do, be sure to explain explicitly how the rabbit should be held and supervise the process closely.

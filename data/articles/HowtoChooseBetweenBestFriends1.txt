 First, try to salvage both relationships by staying out of the situation as much as possible. It can be a tricky tightrope to walk, but it’s often the best approach.Simply listen if one friend talks bad about the other friend. Don’t try to rush to their defense but don’t agree, either. Nodding your head or saying you understand where they’re coming from will help you handle a potentially uncomfortable situation.
Avoid gossip or talking about the situation with anyone who isn’t directly involved.
Make plenty of time for both friends so it doesn’t seem like you’re spending more of your time with one than the other, which could be perceived as choosing sides.;
, In order to eventually move forward, you’ll need to get the issue out in the open. Tell both parties why you feel the way you do, and see if the three of you can come to an agreement together. Call it a “friend-tervention,” if you will.Let your friends know that you’re there for them, but that you won’t get involved or choose sides.
It’s a difficult conversation to have. Try starting your sentences like “I feel like…” or “It seems to me that…” rather than making accusations or blaming anyone.
 If there was a dispute between your other two friends, they may not be able to patch the friendship up immediately, and that’s ok. If you remain neutral and give them time to salvage their feelings, you may find that after a while you’re all hanging out and having fun together once again.Don’t try to force the reconciliation. Be patient and give both friends time to get over their sore feelings.

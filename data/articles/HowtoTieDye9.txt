 Every dye is different, so the exact amount of time you need to soak your fabric in the dye will vary. For commercial products, you should always follow the listed instructions. Generally you can expect:


A chemical dye will usually require you to soak your fabric for 4 to 10 minutes. Soaking your fabric too long could result in the color becoming too dark.
A natural dye will yield the best and brightest color when simmering. Soak your fabric in the heated water for roughly one hour. For a stronger, more vibrant color, soak the fabric overnight., If you plan on dyeing your fabric multiple colors, soak your fabric in the lightest color first. You can do this by dipping the part of your fabric you want dyed in a shallow bowl so only that part of the collected fabric takes on that particular color. Then immerse the fabric in progressively darker shades until all your colors have been used., Use cool, running water after applying each dye application. This will remove excess dye and seal the color in the fabric. Excess dye could splash or bleed to other parts of your shirt where you don't want it! Rinse thoroughly to prevent this.

 Make sure that the funnel can sit in the bottle firmly without moving around too much or falling out.;
, Orange juice and grape juice are two of the most commonly used juices for spritzers, but any flavor—apple, cranberry, pomegranate, mixed berry, tropical punch—will work. Select a brand that is 100% juice over one made with a lot of extra sugar.
 Carbonated water refers to any type of fizzy water that contains bubbles of carbon dioxide.


Mineral water is naturally fizzy and offers the most benefits, but it tends to be fairly expensive.
Seltzer is plain water with artificial carbonation. Of all carbonated waters, it has the cleanest taste.
Club soda is artificially carbonated water with a few extra ingredients. These ingredients are not harmful and tend to add a slight twist or zing to the water.
 This step is entirely optional. If you want your fruit spritzer to have a little more sweetness than the juice itself, a little sugar or honey should go a long way.
 Do not stir or shake the spritzer together, since doing so will remove some of the bubbles, leaving your juice spritzer flat. Simply wait for a minute or two as the liquids combine naturally.


Note that if you added sugar or honey, you may want to gently mix it in by slowly moving the bottle in a circular motion, causing the liquid inside to slosh around slightly. Stop if you hear rapid "fizzing" noises, however.
 Remove the funnel and insert a cork tightly into the top of the bottle to hold in as much carbonation as possible. You can also use any other cap designed to plug or cover a bottle top.
 Pour in the juice, the carbonated water, and the sugar, and plug the bottle with a cork.
 Serve shortly after making so that the spritzer does not lose too much of its "fizz" or carbonation.

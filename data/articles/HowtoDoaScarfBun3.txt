 Use a brush to neatly comb your hair back into a pony. You can place the ponytail high on your head, at the back center of your head, or at the nape of your neck, depending on where you want the bun to end up. Secure it with an elastic.








You don’t have to worry about the color of your elastic. It will be hidden when you add the scarf and create the bun.
 For the bun, you’ll need a rectangular scarf. Carefully create a thin band from it by folding it in on itself lengthwise several times. The finished band should be 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8-cm)., Once the scarf is folded into a band, place it around the base of your ponytail. Tie it into a knot over the hair elastic so an equal amount of the scarf is on either side of ponytail.Ideally, you should use a scarf that is roughly the same length as your hair when it’s tied around the ponytail.
 After you’ve tied the scarf around the ponytail, gather up the ends of the fabric with your hair. Smooth and twist them together so the scarf is fully woven into your hair.
 With the scarf weaved into it, wrap your hair around the base of the ponytail to create a bun. Use several bobby pins to secure the bun in place.








Make sure to wrap the bun as tightly as possible to keep the scarf from coming loose.

 If you ever feel like going on Tumblr think "No, It is a waste of time, I could be doing something constructive".;
, It's the best solution. Instead, read a book, make a snack, do your homework, just don't touch the computer.
 Try doing something on the computer that doesn't use the internet, e.g. games like The Sims; write a book; organize your files, etc.
 Only go on Tumblr after you have done all your homework and had dinner.
 Use Tumblr for only 30 minutes, and then get off the computer.

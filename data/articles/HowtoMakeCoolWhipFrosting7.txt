 Mix these two ingredients together first to establish a base for the frosting.In a medium bowl, add the whipped topping and milk.
Whisk until the ingredients are combined and the mixture begins to thicken (about 2 minutes).
 Combine the remaining ingredients to complete the frosting.


Stir in the peanut butter and sugar until well-combined.
Gently fold in the whipped topping to combine.
 Add the frosting to the top of the dessert, several tablespoons at a time. Once you’ve covered the entire surface, use the spatula to smooth out the frosting and ensure that it’s evenly distributed across the surface.


If you choose, you can use a butter knife or the spatula to create a wave-like design in the frosting.
Or, as an alternative, you can spoon the frosting into a pastry bag (or a plastic storage bag with a small hole cut from one of the corners), and, with a frosting tip, squeeze the frosting onto your dessert.
You can spread this frosting on your dessert of choice, including, for example, cupcakes or refrigerator pies.

 3 feet (0.9 m) long. (approx. 120 stitches). If you want a longer scarf, add more chain stitches until you reach your desired length. Turn and single crochet in the second stitch from the hook.;
, Chain 1 and turn.
 Finish off.



Take a piece of yarn approx. 12 inches (30.5 cm) long and fold in half.






Weave the yarn piece into the end stitches of the scarf by taking the hook and pushing it through the stitch. Then loop the yarn piece onto the hook and pull the hook through the stitch with the looped yarn piece on the hook.






Once the yarn piece is pulled through the stitch, remove the hook and pull the ends of the yarn piece through the loop on the other side and pull tight to create the tassel. Continue in this manner until all end stitches have a tassel.






Trim the tassels so that they are even. Repeat step 4 on the other end of the scarf.

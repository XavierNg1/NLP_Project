 This is because other factors affect heat and cold, especially wind chill and humidity. The number to know, then, is what is called the “apparent temperature.” This is how hot or cold is actually feels to you outdoors after you account for the wind and the humidity.Wind chill is the apparent temperature in cold weather, the perceived decrease in air temperature felt when wind is felt on exposed skin. Meteorologists calculate wind chill by using advanced formulas. However, you can find charts and calculators online that will do the math for you. All you need to know is the air temperature and wind speed. The chart will then give you the wind chill factor for the day.
Heat index is the apparent temperature for hot weather. The heat index is what the temperature feels like to the human body when you account for the humidity in the air. This too is calculated with complex formulas, but you can find charts online that will do the math for you. All you have to know is the air temperature and the relative humidity for the day.
 According to the National Weather Service, frost bite can occur in a matter of minutes once wind chills go below -18ºF.Following their calculation, however, you’ll want to keep your kids indoors well before that.


For example, when the air temperature is 30ºF, a brisk wind of even 10 miles per hour lowers the wind chill factor to about 21ºF, which is about the limit for safe play. An air temp of 25ºF and a light wind of 5 mph make for a wind chill of 19 ºF.
 Like wind chill, be aware of what levels of apparent hot temperatures are safe and what are unsafe. Consider the following: an air temperature of 90ºF will feel like 97ºF when the relative humidity is at 70%. An air temperature of 95ºF will feel like 114ºF with a relative humidity of 80%. These apparent temperatures can be very unsafe.


Keep in mind sunlight, as well. Full exposure to the sun can increase heat index factors by up to 15ºF. A 97ºF heat index will then feel fully like 112ºF

 You can become infected with HIV by using a needle that has been previously used by someone with HIV. This can occur even if the needle appears clean. Because many injected drugs are addictive, it can be difficult to turn down an opportunity to inject, even if you know the needle is unsafe. Entering a substance abuse recovery program is highly recommended in this scenario.
 Use new, sterile syringes each time, or confirm with the tattoo artist that they are not re-using a needle. Make sure to receive your needles from a reputable source. Never reuse or share anything used to prepare or take drugs, including water (as this could be contaminated with HIV-infected blood). After using, dispose of needles safely by throwing them away inside a closed bottle, preferably one with no recycling refund or collectible value.Some regions have free needle exchange programs where people can turn in used needles and receive clean ones in return. Search online for programs in your area.
 If stopping or finding a new needle are not possible, clean and disinfect a used needle before injecting. This does not make the needle safe; it only partially reduces the risk. First, fill the syringe with clean water, shake it to dislodge particles of blood, then empty. Repeat this process several times, until no more blood is visible. Next, fill the syringe with a disinfectant such as household bleach, and let sit for at least 30 seconds. Empty and rinse gain with more clean water in order to remove the disinfectant.Bleach stored in a warm or sunny place can break down and become much less effective.

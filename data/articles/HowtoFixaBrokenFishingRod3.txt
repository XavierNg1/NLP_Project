 You want a new guide with the same diameter as the original guide. (This is particularly important if the guide is the guide nearest the rod on a spinning reel, which is particularly large to accommodate line coming off the reel during a cast.)

,, Cut the wrappings on top of or on the edges of the guide feet if you can. Avoid cutting into the rod blank.
, Be sure to line it up with the other guides so that its bottom center aligns with the bottom centers of the guides on either side of it.
 Check the alignment of the new guide with the other guides a final time before coating the new wrappings with epoxy resin or polymer to seal them in place.

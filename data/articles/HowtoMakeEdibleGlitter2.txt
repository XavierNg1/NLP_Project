 Line a baking sheet with parchment paper in readiness. While you can use a no-heat method, applying a little bit of heat allows the sugar (i.e. "glitter") to take the color dye even better.
 You can use regular old table sugar if you want, but you'll probably find that raw sugar works better. That's because the granules are a bit bigger and withstand the heat a bit better.
 This comes out to about 4 to 5 drops of dye for each 1/4 cup of sugar.
 Ensure that the color is on most or all of the sugar.
 Push down any lumps to make one even layer.
 Keep an eye on the sugar after 8 minutes. Depending on the oven (which may run hot), some sugars cook quicker than others. If you start to see any sugar crystals begin to melt or boil, remove from the oven.


While baking, check now and then and push down any lumps you see.
 Once cooled, the glitter sugar is ready to use or can be stored in an airtight container.

 Use a soft cloth or brush to gently remove obvious dirt and debris from the surface of the shoe. Spray a stain remove, such as Shout, onto the stain. Lightly brush the stain with a bristle brush.
 Before washing your canvas shoes, remove the shoelaces. Shoelaces can be washed in the washing machine with like colors.








Do not place the shoelaces in the washing machine with the shoes unless the shoelaces are white. The dye from the shoelaces can transfer to the white shoes.
 Add a small amount of laundry detergent. Wash your shoes in warm water. Avoid placing the shoes in the washing machine with clothing or other shoes.Check the label on the inside of the shoe for cleaning instructions. The label should tell you if the shoes are washing machine safe.
 A clothes dryer will dry your shoes faster. Check the cleaning instructions inside of the shoe to verify that it is safe to put your shoes in the dryer. If not, lay your shoes out on a towel to dry. When letting your shoes air dry, stuff your shoes with clean, white, paper towels. The paper will absorb the water and decrease the drying time.The paper will also help hold the shoeâ€™s shape as they dry.
 Only relace your shoes once the shoes and shoelaces have completely dried. This is especially important if your shoelaces are not white. The dye from the shoe laces can transfer to the white shoes when the fabrics are wet.

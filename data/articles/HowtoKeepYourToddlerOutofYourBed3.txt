 If your child is really having a hard time staying in her own room, it might mean that she is not ready to sleep alone yet. However, that does not mean that she should sleep in your bed. Put her mattress on the floor in your room, and tell her that that is her special part of the room, but that your bed is your special part of the room too.


As your child gets more comfortable, move the bed further and further away from your bed.
 Each night, move your bed further and further away from your child’s bed. After two or three days, sit in a chair in your child’s room until your child falls asleep. Do not talk to your child while sitting there; simply sit quietly.If your child begins to talk to you, tell her that you will leave the room if she keeps talking. If she does, leave the room and tell her that you will only come back if she sits quietly in her bed until she falls asleep.
 Whatever the reason—fear, nightmare, fever—do not let your child sleep in your bed. If you do, it will send her mixed messages that could have her coming back to your bed every night.Comfort your child, and even offer to stay near her while she falls back to sleep, but do not let her sleep in your bed.
 Remind her that nighttime is a time for sleeping, not for walking around. Give her a kiss and a hug, and remind her you are nearby, but that you expect her to stay in bed for the rest of the night.
 One reason that children get out of bed is because they want attention from their parents. If you give your child lots of love and attention during the day, she will be less likely to seek it out at night.

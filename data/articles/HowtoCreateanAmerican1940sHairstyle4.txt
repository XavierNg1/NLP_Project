 Removing knots and tangles before ratting will make the process easier to complete and less painful to undo later.
 Ratting at the top of your head and working down around the sides keeps your hair accessible for holding or styling.
 A bristled brush works best for hair styles involving the whole head, while a fine-toothed comb rats hair tightly in a smaller, concentrated area.
 Prevent your ratted hair from falling loose by spraying each ratted section with hairspray.
 For example, for a front-bump, gently push the ratted hair together in a clump and comb a small section of un-ratted hair over the ratted ball. Secure the front-bump style with a clip.

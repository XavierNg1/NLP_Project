 Turn the oven on to 400 degrees F (200 C). You should also spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and set it aside while you make the glaze.The cooking spray will prevent the wedges from sticking to the pan as they bake.
 Get out a medium saucepan and melt 1/4 cup (28 g) of unsalted butter over medium heat. Stir in 3/4 cup (150 g) of packed dark brown sugar, 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger, and 1 (3-inch or 7.5 cm) cinnamon stick. Simmer the mixture for about 5 minutes.To simmer the glaze, let it come to a gentle bubble. You should stir the glaze every once in a while to keep it from sticking to the pan.
 Wash 4 pounds (1.8 kg) of sweet potatoes and peel the skins off with a vegetable peeler. Use a sharp knife to carefully trim off and discard the pointy ends of each sweet potato. Slice each sweet potato in half crosswise and slice each portion into 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) wedges. Place the sweet potato wedges into a mixing bowl.Try to cut the wedges into uniform pieces, so they roast evenly.
 Remove the cinnamon stick and pour the glaze over the sweet potato wedges. Use a spoon to toss the wedges and glaze, so the potatoes are completely coated.The glaze may begin to harden if it sits for too long. You may need to stir it again before pouring it over the wedges.
 Put the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Bake the wedges for 40 minutes or until they become soft.To help them cook evenly, stir or flip the wedges halfway through the roasting time.

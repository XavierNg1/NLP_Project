 Before you start putting different apps in folders, you may want to think about which apps you will go for. Are you wanting to make a gaming folder with all of your favorite games? Or perhaps a folder that contains all of your most important contacts? Regardless, you should know this before going any further.;
, Swipe on the screen to the left to bring up the app drawer. Scroll through this list to find an app that you are interested in adding to a folder. Press and hold the app you and select the “Pin to start” option from the drop-down menu that appears.


After selecting “pin to start”, the app you have chosen to pin will appear on your home screen. Repeat this for the other apps you would like to group into a folder.
 Once you have finished pinning the apps that you are planning to put into a folder, go to your home screen. Once there, press and hold on the app you would like to place in a folder, and drag it over to another app that you want in the same folder. Once you move one app over the other, the app underneath should flip over and you should now see a series of boxes, creating a folder. Simply remove your finger from the screen to drop the app inside the folder.
 Once you have created the folder, you can add any other apps to that folder by holding and dragging the app to the folder. You can add as many apps you want into a folder.
 Once you have all the different apps you want inside the new folder, you may want to name the folder. Tap the folder to open it. All the apps inside should be displayed in a larger box right beneath the folder icon. There should be gray bars that line the top and bottom of the folder. Press and hold the top bar, and a text field should appear. Type in the title you would like the folder to have, then tap away from the text field when you are finished.

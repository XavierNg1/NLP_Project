 Clutter is dangerous in a kitchen, so you want to make sure there is enough room to store all of your cooking equipment when you aren't using it. If you don't have enough storage space, you may need to create more, or get rid of unnecessary items., A well-lit kitchen will help you to see what you are working with. It can also keep the area cheerful and welcoming.Make sure your lighting fixtures don't produce glare or shadows., Polished marble is very slippery, and can be dangerous. Instead, wood, rubber, cork, or slate are all better for a kitchen. You should also consider a non-slip mat, especially in front of the sink., Make sure your water temperature is not set too high to avoid scalding and burns. A temperature between 120 and 125 degrees should be high enough for what you need, but not too hot that you will get burned.You can also install anti-scald devices on your faucets to prevent the water from getting too hot., Since many fires start in the kitchen, get a fire extinguisher. It should be stored somewhere away from stoves and ovens, as that will be where you will most likely need it. You don't want the flames to prevent you from getting to the extinguisher.Make sure you read the instructions when you buy the extinguisher. Don't wait until you have a fire in the kitchen before you read the instruction on how to use it.

 There are two styles of gameplay for Templars. The first is a more combat-based style, where you will be a damage dealer for your party, with a lesser focus on healing them.If you want to do this style of gameplay, you'll want to focus on the skills in the Aedric's Spear tree (and to a lesser extent, Dawn's Wrath).
Good weapons for this style of gameplay include two-handed and sword and shield.
Points should be distributed mainly into magicka and stamina, but it will be important to have some points distributed into health as well, since your character will see some action.
 The more common role and better use of the Templar is as the party healer (this being the second style of gameplay for this class). Templars have many abilities which allow them to play the very crucial role of keeping everyone alive through a battle.


If you want to do this style of gameplay, you'll want to focus on the skills in the Restoring Light tree, though you can also pick up some of the others in order to defend yourself.
A restoration staff will of course be a must have for this class, but you can also build your skills in another weapon as well, in order to maintain a basic ability to protect yourself.
Almost all of your points should be going in to your magicka. Since there are a few spells which let you heal yourself as well, having a higher health will be much less of a concern and you should be doing very little attacking, making stamina a very minor concern.
 The light armor skills include bonuses to magicka absorption and your magicka pool, so it is best to put healing Templars in light armor. Heavy or light armor can be used for a combat-based Templar.
 The best use of your time, as a Templar, will be to support your allies by keeping them alive. This will usually mean healing, but it can also mean playing defense as well. This role requires you to be unselfish, and focused only on group success, not personal glory.

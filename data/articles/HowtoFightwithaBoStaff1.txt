, You should try just swinging it in as many ways as possible for two or three days (one hour per day)Â To get the feel of your weapon, you need to be agressive.
 The strike is the primary and most useful move. Practice the basic strikes, which are,diagonally towards southwest, and southeast.The 'stab' is the most useful move as it is harder to defend. Practice slowly until you perfect your moves, and then do them more quickly. As Bruce Lee said, "I don't fear the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times."

, It should come easily as you familiarize with your staff. Also, try to imagine yourself defending those combos. Add some moves which would make it harder to stop. A little twist here, a slight flick there could make a lot of difference.
 Try some arm exercises which would lend your arm more strength. Add power to your strikes. Exercise daily.
 More fight is in your legs than the weapon. Practice footing to add force to your blows. Move forward as you strike, and sideways as you parry. Moving backwards is almost always a disadvantage. Stay away from rotations, turning your back on your opponent, even for the fraction of a second, is not a good idea.

 First, you should determine the GTW and TW of your trailer when fully loaded. Table 1 shows some common examples of trailer weights. Then, you should determine whether your vehicle is rated to accept the weight of your trailer.
Gross Trailer Weight (GTW) is the fully loaded weight of your trailer in the condition that you would tow it in. If you don't know the weight of your trailer, the best way to measure it is on a vehicle scale. Weigh stations in your area are a good resource for determining GTW.
 Your vehicle's suspension carries this weight. In most cases, the TW is 10-15 percent of the overall trailer weight.

Tongue Weight of up to 300 pounds can be measured on a standard bathroom scale by resting the trailer coupler on the scale. You should make sure the scale is securely propped up so that the Tongue Weight is measured with the trailer coupler at the standard towing height.
 Set a length of pipe on each and rest a beam across the pipes. Re-zero the scale to correct for the weight of the beam and pipe. Securely block the trailer wheels. Rest the trailer jack on the beam as shown, one (1) foot from the brick and two (2) feet from the scale. To obtain the TW, multiply the scale reading by three (3). For greater tongue weights, place the scale and brick four (4) feet apart, rest the jack on the beam three (3) feet from the scale and multiply the scale reading by four (4).
 Contact your local car dealer if you cannot find the information or have lost the manual.

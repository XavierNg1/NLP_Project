 Without benefits or a steady income, you will want to stay somewhere in the world that is affordable and budget-friendly.


Compare the cost of housing, food, transportation and other essentials before you decide to travel and live in a particular country or city. London may sound great, but it is a lot more expensive to live and work there than cities in Costa Rica or Vietnam.
 If you are going to work from a country that uses currency other than your own, you will have to factor in the differing monetary value and the cost to exchange money.


Plan for the type of money you will earn, as well. If you are working online for clients across the world, you can ask for payment in your home currency. If you are working for a local business, you will be paid in that country's currency.
 When you work from anywhere in the world, you can move to different places yearly, monthly and even more frequently. Avoid tourists and higher prices by traveling when most people do not.


Try Iceland in the winter, for example, or Central America during the rainy season.

 Then it can be expressed as a fraction ab{\displaystyle {\frac {a}{b}}}, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are both whole numbers, and b{\displaystyle b} is not 0{\displaystyle 0}. Furthermore, this fraction is written in simplest terms, meaning that either a{\displaystyle a} or b{\displaystyle b}, or both are odd whole numbers.

2b2=a2{\displaystyle 2b^{2}=a^{2}}


, a2{\displaystyle a^{2}} is even number because it is equal to two times a whole number. Since a2{\displaystyle a^{2}} is even, a{\displaystyle a} must be even too, because if it were odd, a2{\displaystyle a^{2}} would be odd as well (an odd number times and odd number is always an odd number). a{\displaystyle a} is even, so that means it can be written as two times a certain whole number, or in other words, a=2k{\displaystyle a=2k}, where k{\displaystyle k} is this whole number.



2=(2k)2b2{\displaystyle 2={\frac {(2k)^{2}}{b^{2}}}}.
 (2k)2=22k2=4k2{\displaystyle (2k)^{2}=2^{2}k^{2}=4k^{2}}.


2=4k2b2{\displaystyle 2={\frac {4k^{2}}{b^{2}}}}


, 


2b2=4k2{\displaystyle 2b^{2}=4k^{2}}.



b2=2k2{\displaystyle b^{2}=2k^{2}}


, b2{\displaystyle b^{2}} is even number because it is equal to two times a whole number. Since b2{\displaystyle b^{2}} is even, b{\displaystyle b} must be even too, because if it were odd, b2{\displaystyle b^{2}} would be odd as well (an odd number times and odd number is always an odd number).
 You have just proven that b{\displaystyle b} is even. However, you have also proven that a{\displaystyle a} is an even number. This is a contradiction because in the beginning of this proof, it was assumed that ab{\displaystyle {\frac {a}{b}}} was written in simplest terms, but if both a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are even, the numerator en denominator can be divided by 2, which means it was not written in simplest terms. Since this is a contradiction, the original assumption that 2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} is rational is false, thus leading to the conclusion that 2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} is irrational.

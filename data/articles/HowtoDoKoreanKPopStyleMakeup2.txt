 The goal of this article isn't to look more ethnically Korean, it's to use Korean beauty techniques to make you look the way you want to look. Also, Kpop artists dye their hair very frequently, so in pop culture, hair color is much more varied than you'd think.
 The way you wear your hair can highlight certain aspects of your face, so make sure you pick the best haircuts and styles to go with your face structure.
 Pay attention to trends in Korean hairstyles and adopt those that will work best for you. Popular styles include long straight hair with bangs, long and wavy hair with a center part, short cropped hair, and clips or large bows as hair accessories.

 If you are painting metal railings, get a primer with a rust inhibitor. Otherwise, consult with a hardware store clerk about the best kind of outdoor primer for your project.


Use a small, 3 to 5 inch (7.6 to 12.7Â cm), roller to apply the primer on the spindles if they are small but square. If your railings are ornate, you will need to use a wire or sponge brush.






Make sure to coat well in 1 direction. Do not leave any excess paint, because you will be able to see priming strokes through the finish coat of paint.






Allow the primer to dry according to package directions.
 Use careful strokes in the same direction. Buy a brush that is well sized to your railings to avoid drips from the application of too much paint.
 This will increase the durability of your paint job.


For intricate metal railings, you may choose to apply paint with a paint sprayer. Try to get a small paint sprayer that will reach into crevices. Set up a cardboard shield, if possible, to avoid spraying grass or walls.

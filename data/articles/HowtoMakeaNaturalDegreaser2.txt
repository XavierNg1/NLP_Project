 Distilled vinegar (also called white vinegar) can be used alone as a degreaser. The vinegar can be applied to greasy surfaces with either a spray bottle or a cloth, and should cut most grease with minimal rubbing. Mix 1 part vinegar to 4 parts water. Let it stand for 5-10 minutes before rinsing with water.The vinegar's smell will dissipate shortly after it has been dried away, so be careful to dry the surfaces thoroughly with a cloth after using the vinegar.
 Baking soda also works well alone as a degreaser. To make it into a usable form, mix it with water to form a paste. Depending on how strong you want the mixture to be, you can add up to 5 parts water to 1 part baking soda, although adding less water will give you a thicker, more potent paste. After applying the baking soda paste with a cloth, rinse the surface with water to avoid leaving a granular residue.


This natural degreaser cannot be easily applied using a spray bottle, as the baking soda may clog the spray mechanism. It works better when you smear it onto the surface directly.
 Another option for a homemade natural degreaser can be prepared easily in an empty dish soap bottle. Fill the bottle about halfway with ammonia and fill the remaining portion with hot water. Add a few drops of natural castille soap. Cap the bottle and shake it well. The solution can be squirted directly onto the greasy surfaces from the bottle, or it can be applied with a cloth.
 Pour 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water into a large bucket. To the water, add a cup (240 ml) of ammonia, half a cup (120 ml) of vinegar, and a quarter cup (60 ml) of baking soda. Stir these ingredients together well. This mixture can be applied using a cloth to cut grease, and can be stored for later use in a clean jug with a lid. Before each use, stir the mixture in case any baking soda has settled out.

 Whether you choose to accomplish this step by using a screwdriver or pulling the knob off, it does not matter. As long as the head of the screw is not stripped and you have the knob in your hand, you are ready to move on to the next step.;
, Fit the sliver as far down as it will go into the knob/pull and break the end off.


Make sure the break is flush so that no extra wood or plastic is sticking out.
You do not need to fill the hole completely (there can be room on either side). You just want to be able to give the screw traction.
For drawer handles with two attachments, place it in the hole(s) that need more traction.
 You will need to apply firm pressure while being careful not to overtighten because you will now have the resistance needed to keep the handle firmly on the door/drawer. Tighten the screw (or twist the knob) until the knob is flush with the door/drawer.
 You should now have a solid knob that does not wobble or come off in your hand.

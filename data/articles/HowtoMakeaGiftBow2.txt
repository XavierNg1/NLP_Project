 To get the desired ribbon length, wrap the ribbon loosely around the length of the box, then its width. This is the basic length, then add another 60cm (24 inches) to the length, for making the bow with. (This additional measurement may need adjusting for a much larger box.)


Choose a color of ribbon to suit the gift box.
 Wrap the ribbon around the length of the box first, and hold it at the base of the box.
 Twist the ribbons around each other by 90 degrees to pull each end of the ribbon horizontally.
 Twist the ends to keep the wrong side of the ribbon facing the box, then pull the ends up and over the center of the box. Pull tightly to keep the ribbon firm.
 Tie a bow by folding the right loop over the left and folding it underneath the left loop. Pull towards you, then pull tightly.
 This forms the knot. Pull tightly.
 Cut either a diagonal or a V-shape to prevent fraying.
 the gift now has a complete gift bow made from ribbon.

 You can't delete pages in the free Adobe Reader.
 If it isn't there, click "View" → "Show/Hide" → "Navigation Panes" → "Page Thumbnails".
 You can click and drag your mouse to select multiple pages at once, or you can hold Ctrl and click each page that you want to select.
 The "Delete" button is located at the top of the Page Thumbnails pane

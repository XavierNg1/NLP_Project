 Are you just announcing something or are you open to a dialogue? For example, if you want to let people know you’re taking an exotic vacation, it’s better to engage your network. Try something like, “Just booked a ticket to India. Anyone have hotel or restaurant recommendations?”;
, T.M.I (too much information) on the World Wide Web is tasteless. When you share too much, people stop asking questions and it’s as if you’re simply looking for a reaction rather than a discourse. An Internet interaction, with the same depth as a face-to-face conversation, should be the goal.
 Primarily, avoid controversial topics (politics, religion, etc.) in such a diverse and public forum. Unless, of course, you are willing to experience feedback and varied responses. If you feel compelled to stir up your social network, try posing a question such as “What does everyone think about the new health care initiative?” Your neutral headline will be less controversial and this will keep you within the boundaries of electronic etiquette.
 Events like getting a new house, a marriage proposal, a college acceptance, a job promotion, the birth of a child, etc. are fine to share with the cyber community. However, it’s advisable to let those closest to you know more personally so they don’t find out the same way as someone you haven’t spoken to in three years.
 It’s fine to promote an accomplishment like getting an article published or a product you support, but keep sponsorships to a minimum. Self-endorsement can come across as self-indulgent.

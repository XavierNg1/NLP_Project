 Refer to the list of Things You'll Need below. Note that graph paper isn't necessary, but it is very hard to draw a neat fractal without at least lined paper.
 It is best to start in the upper-left corner, as it is easier to expand the pattern down and to the right.


Note how you have four figures: two standing upright, next to each other, and two laying on their side, with the upside facing inwards.
 You should now have a continuous line from the bottom left, going up and then down, to end in the lower right corner.
 This means you draw the same pattern next to it (red), rotate the paper 90° counterclockwise, draw the same pattern again (green), rotate the paper 180° degrees, and draw the pattern again (brown).
 Look at how you connect the two upper curves in the middle, at their bottoms, the lower-right curve with the upper-right in the middle on the right side, and the lower-left curve with the upper-left in the middle, on the left side. This is always the same.
 The one show in the picture is a 4th order Hilbert curve. You can fit a 5th order Hilbert curve on a regular sheet of A4 graph paper.
 You could draw each next order in a different colour, as in the picture, or just make up your own way of colouring this beautiful fractal.

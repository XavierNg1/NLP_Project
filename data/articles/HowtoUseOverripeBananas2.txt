1 big handful of chopped spinach or kale
1 cup of plain yogurt
1 big spoonful of peanut butter
1 diced green apple
3/4 cup dairy, soy, or almond milk
Cinnamon and honey, to taste

, If needed, stop the blender at 20 second intervals to scrape the sides and mix ingredients with a rubber spatula.
 If you'd like, garnish with a handful of your favorite granola, berries, or a dollop of whipped cream.

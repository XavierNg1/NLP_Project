 You can choose your favourite black tea variety but avoid ones already flavoured with fruit or other strong flavours, as you can't be sure the fruit will meld well with them.
 The best fruit is sweet and strong in flavour. For example, peaches, apricots, raspberries, watermelon, strawberries, etc. Prepare the fruit by washing, then cutting it into small pieces., Use either one teabag or a teaspoon of tea leaves (inside a tea caddy or enclosure) and add these to the 950ml or 1 quart heatproof glass jar. Pour in boiling water. Let it steep for 3 minutes, then remove the teabag or enclosed leaves. Leave the fruit pieces in., Stand aside for 10 minutes., Pour the fruit tea into mugs or cups if serving hot. If serving cold, chill for a half an hour, then pour into a glass with ice.

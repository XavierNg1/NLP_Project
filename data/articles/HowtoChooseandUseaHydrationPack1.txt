 Hydration packs are best for activities where you can’t stop or don’t want to stop frequently, if at all. If you’re running or biking, for instance, you probably won’t want to slow down each time you get thirsty. Plus, hydration packs offer pack stability that regular backpacks coupled with a bottle or water bladder cannot. If, on the other hand, you’re going on long hikes or canoe trips where you’ll have time to stop and reach for your water bottle, you might not need a hydration pack.Longer trips – multi-day hikes, mountain climbs, and so on – may also require more storage capacity than the average hydration pack affords.
Some hydration packs are designed for specific activities. For instance, the CamelBak Race Baku is intended for bikers.;
, Do you sweat a lot when engaged in physical activity? If so, you might need a large reservoir of water. If you don’t sweat much, or don’t plan on getting too thirsty during your workout, you might be okay with a smaller reservoir of water.Most packs are available in one liter (or 1.5 liter), two liter, and three liter varieties., If you intend to use your pack during the winter, you might want an insulated pack. Insulated packs also keep your water cooler than a regular pack during the hot summer months. However, the extra insulation will add to the cost of the pack., Hydration packs are available in a range of prices. Larger packs are typically more expensive than smaller packs. Assuming two packs have the same size but different costs, the expensive pack will generally be of higher quality than the less-expensive pack. Decide what your budget is before buying a hydration pack.Look for deals when shopping for a hydration pack. Outdoor equipment retailers often have sales during the holidays. Compare prices online, too.
Be prepared to spend $50 to $150 (US) on a hydration pack.

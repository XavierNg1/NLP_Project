 One of the most important traits for a Maltese show dog to possess is obedience. This trainability should be at least somewhat obvious, even as a young puppy. Notice if the dog listens to you when you speak to it and if it seems to adapt its behavior based on previous learning experiences.Try telling the dog “no” to a behavior you don’t want it to do. If the dog seems to understand, or at least try to, then this is a good sign for trainability.
 Personality is one of the things these dogs are known for. The dog you are showing should be fearless. They are sweet dogs that are not at all aggressive. The personality needs to be playful. Any Maltese without these traits is not show worthy.You want a Maltese dog that is comfortable around people and not afraid of a crowd. Your dog should not be aggressive or shy.
 If you are purchasing a puppy, meet the parents of the litter. If you cannot meet the father, at least see the mom. By observing the behaviors of the parents, you should be able to get an idea about the temperament of your puppy.Behavioral characteristics in dogs are often shared genetically – so a dog that is mild-mannered is likely to give birth to puppies with similar mild-mannered temperaments. And vice versa with disobedient or aggressive behaviors.
This is also a great way to get an estimate about the ultimate size your Maltese puppy will grow to.

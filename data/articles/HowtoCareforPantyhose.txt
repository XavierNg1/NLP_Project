 Instead of entering feet at the top of the hose and running them through the length of the legs to the bottom, gather the pantyhose in your fingers until you reach the toes; place your toes into the hose, then stretch the length of the stocking up over your calves and thighs. Be careful, when gathering the stocking, not to twist the legs, as this will affect your ability to stretch them over your leg comfortably.;
, Treat all tears immediately. Apply a small amount of clear nail polish to small tears, in order to prevent the tear from becoming longer. Allow the polish to dry before storing pantyhose.
 Instead of storing used pantyhose with other clothes on which they might become caught, wash them with soap in a sink, and hang them on a clothesline to dry. Never wash pantyhose in a washing machine.
 Store them in a plastic bag, in a safe place such as a dresser drawer, where they will be undisturbed by other items that might snag them.

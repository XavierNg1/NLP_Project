 Even if you're not using the generator, it needs to be serviced. Select dates that fall outside possible severe weather such as heat spells, cold snaps, windy and stormy periods, etc. I generally tell customers to service their generators in the spring and fall times to keep it on a regular schedule (Rae Klepadlo). If you keep pushing off the maintenance, chances are your generator will not work when the time comes. An average service takes about an hour to complete, depending on what you find.;
, Keep this updated with the dates of service and any issues found and fixed.

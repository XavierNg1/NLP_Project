, Castle Wars isn't just about combat! It's mainly about being fast and sneaky, and barricades will slow your team mates down, unless you destroy them before they get to them.

 This is probably the easiest way to contribute to your team. There will be players coming for your flag alone and others will come in groups, so be aware and have a decent combat level. If you're guarding the flag alone, make sure you have a combat level of at least one hundred. If you're there with your team mates, make sure you have a combat level of at least eighty.

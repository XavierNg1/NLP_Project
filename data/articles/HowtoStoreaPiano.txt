 If the piano is going from a heated environment into a cool or cold one, or vice versa, give it a chance to acclimatize. Any sudden cooling or sudden heating will harm the piano.;
, The piano must be kept dry and generally cool. Avoid placing it anywhere that is damp, moist, or humid. If you do, the piano will begin to deteriorate rapidly.
 Wipe it down the remove the dust and give it a good polish.
 Another enemy of the piano is dust getting into its inner workings. When stored, the piano should be fully covered.
 Prior to adding a cover, wrap the piano in blankets to protect it from knocks and bangs in storage and when being shifted. The blankets can be tied into place with string or yarn., If you see signs of damage, you can get them treated upon checking rather than leaving it to completely fall into disrepair.

 Use a giant hole punch to punch out large circles.


Consider having an assortment of an even number of newspaper and cardstock circles on hand before you start to design.;
, You could create a pattern where every other circle is newspaper followed by a cardstock circle or you could randomly add newspaper––get creative!

, Use enough glue without saturating the circles (too much and the Mod Podge could bleed through).

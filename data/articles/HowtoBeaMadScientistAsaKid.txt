 No need to be so organized, after all, the title reads Mad Scientist, right ? Dress in outfits that you can get messy, because you will make a mess if you make Experiments.;
, This is a very important step, because every scientist has a scientific Laboratory ! It could be in your backyard, a treehouse, could be anywhere in your house like your room, the bathroom,the basement, or even a secret room that no one but you knows about ! Just make sure that it is big enough for doing experiments and research.
 Look at things you will need. You will need different thing for different Experiments, so make sure you have those things.
 Making Blueprints, for example, is good for when you are inventing something. Or you could write a list of the things you want to invent, things you want to do research on, etc.
 If you think that they will work, make your inventions. Test them out, just in case. After that present your new invention to someone. Maybe your friend or your family! This is one of the most fun parts of being a scientist.

 Setting an alarm clock, even for the right number of hours, can lessen your quality of sleep. Alarm clocks raise stress and make you wake up stressed, not fresh.If you don't need to get up at a certain time, turn off your alarm.


If you have a week off of work, go the whole time without your alarm clock. Write down the times you wake up.
If you find that your natural sleep patterns are different than you had suspected, try adjusting your schedule to match it.
Avoid pressing the snooze button. Your body will not relax entirely into deep sleep when you press snooze, and you might wake up feeling more tired, not less.
 Sun and sunlight let your body know it's time to wake up. As soon as you wake up, open your curtains. Eat breakfast on your porch, if you have one, or by a window that lets in light. During the winter, try using a full-spectrum UV light on dark mornings., As soon as you wake up, drink a glass of water. Take a shower, put on clean clothing that you really enjoy, and eat a tasty, nutritious breakfast. Drink coffee if you are a coffee drinker. Massage your face to kickstart your circulation.Some studies suggest that waking up to bright colors or fresh flowers can boost your mood and energy. Hang a gorgeous painting or cloth on your walls, put out flowers, eat colorful fruit for breakfast, and wake up refreshed.

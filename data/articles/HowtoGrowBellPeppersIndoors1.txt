 Allow the seeds to sit for two to eight hours, until they sink to the bottom of the cup. Soaking the seeds breaks down some of the hard coating, speeding up the germination process.


You can also try soaking the pepper seeds in weak chamomile tea or a solution made with 1 cup (250 ml) warm water and 1 or 2 teaspoons (5 or 10 ml) of 3% hydrogen peroxide. These solutions are even more effective at breaking down the coating and have the added benefit of disinfecting the seeds.;
, A sterilized, loose-draining potting mix purchased from a garden supply or home improvement store should be sufficient.
 The hole should be about 1/4 inch (2/3 cm) deep.
 Drop one seed into each hole and loosely cover it with additional soil.
 Sweet bell peppers germinate best when the soil temperature is at 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) or higher. If possible, sit the seedling tray on top of a seedling heat mat. Otherwise, place it on a warm, sunny windowsill.
 Once the surface of the soil becomes dry, spray it down with water. Do not drench the soil, but do not allow it to dry out.

 Don't skimp; ice is a necessary component to chill and blend the other ingredients.

,, The amount and type of vermouth varies according to taste (from a splash to a shot). Some people like their martinis "perfect"—that is, made with 50% red (also known as "Italian" or "sweet") and 50% white (also known as "French" or "dry") vermouth. Note: "perfect" in this context is a bit of cocktail terminology referring to the vermouth mixture, and is not a value judgement regarding the flavor of a martini made this way. In a similar vein, one could order e.g. a "perfect" Manhattan.









Optional: Shake and pour into glass. Roll vermouth in glass to form a film or coating then dump out. This will make for a drier martini.
If you are using vodka, you can use a cocktail shaker, or mix the martini by stirring. You can use the shaker bottom for mixing and stirring, if you'd like. Some people insist that gin should never be shaken, but rather always stirred to avoid "bruising" the gin. This is a personal preference. Try them both and see which you prefer!
Optional: Add 1 – 2 dashes of orange bitters. Be careful when adding bitters because a little goes a long way. You will be able to taste the difference by adding even 1 drop because it is highly concentrated. Start with less and add more if desired.
 Melted water from the ice is a necessary ingredient to a proper martini to mellow the "burn" off the alcohol.

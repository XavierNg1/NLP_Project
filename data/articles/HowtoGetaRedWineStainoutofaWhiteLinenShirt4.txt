 Many swear by using white wine to get out red wine stains. Lay out the shirt and pour the white wine over the stain. Then using a clean cloth or napkin dab at the stain and soak it up. This method works best directly after the stain happens. Essentially, the white wine is moistening the area of the stain and preventing the red wine from setting. You want to make sure that you are using a very pale white wine to prevent further staining.
Keep in mind that although many have used this method successfully, there is some controversy about using white wine. Some argue that all white wines have a tint to them, so using them can help and harm at the same time., Right after the stain occurs, pour a generous amount of club soda over the stain. Keep pouring as you see the red stain fading. Keep a paper towel handy and blot at the stain. Just as with the wine, pouring club soda helps to remove the stain by preventing the red wine from setting. Some argue that water is just as effective as club soda. Use water as an alternative if you do not have any club soda or seltzer in your home.
 Make a paste out of baking soda by using a 3-1 ratio of baking soda and water. Make enough paste to cover the stain. Leave the paste on the stain until dry. Then carefully scrape off the paste from the stain.


Baking soda effectively removes stains by absorbing and lifting stains.
 Instead of making a paste, some suggest sprinkling baking soda over the stain. Then take a clean napkin or cloth, pour white vinegar on it and wring it out. Wipe the towel over the stain.This should remove the stain.

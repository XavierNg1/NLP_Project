 Before you purchase your coconut, examine the surface of it to make sure that there are no cracks or mold on it. Healthy coconuts will be heavy because they are filled with liquid. Shake the coconut to see if you can feel the liquid inside.








Coconut water helps keep the white flesh of the coconut from drying out.;
, The eye of the coconut will look like a dark circle. Often there is tree eyes in the coconut. Find the softest one and press against it with a sharp object like a knife, screwdriver, or wine opener. Your tool should easily puncture through the hard shell and into the flesh of the coconut.
 Once you've punctured past the hard shell, turn the coconut over and drain the water out of it into a bowl. If you want, you can drink the drained coconut water.
 Rotate the coconut in your hand and rap against the side of it with the back of a heavy kitchen knife. Make sure that the blade isn't facing the coconut. As you rotate it, you should hear and see it crack open., Place the coconut inside of a plastic bag and throw it hard against the concrete floor or a brick wall. This will shatter the coconut apart and make it easier to get at the white flesh of the fruit.

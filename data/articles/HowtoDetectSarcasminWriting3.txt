 If you are the target of sarcasm, there are a variety of ways to respond. If you do not want to engage in an argument, you can choose to simply not acknowledge sarcasm.


Simply ignore the sarcastic comment. Return to the point you were trying to make without engaging in it. For example, let's return to the healthcare example. You could simply reiterate your own points in favor of healthcare while not acknowledging the "just wonderful" comment.If you want to deescalate a potentially intense situation and get back on track to making progress, simply ignoring sarcasm is a good route.
 Sarcasm may not be intended to be taken seriously. If you're just joking around with someone, and they text you a sarcastic comment, you can text back one of your own. Exchanging sarcastic texts and e-mails is a great way to have fun with a friend., A sarcastic e-mail is often a cause of frustration, especially if you get one in a work setting. This is often unprofessional and you may be unsure of the best response. Try to remain calm and respond to a sarcastic work e-mail appropriately.


Wait a few hours to respond. If you're frustrated by an e-mail, you may end up saying something you don't mean in response. Give yourself time to process before firing back.Be the bigger person in this case. Do not fire back with sarcasm of your own. Instead, respond with something like, "I'm sorry you're feeling frustrated." As a lot of meaning is lost through written communication, it may be a good idea to take the conversation offline. Say something like, "I'll be in my office at 3 today, if you would like to discuss this matter further."If the sender refuses to deescalate the situation, and responds with further aggression or sarcasm, you may want to report the issue to someone in human resources.

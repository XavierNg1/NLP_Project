 Buying multiple lift tickets at the same time is often less expensive than buying them individually. In addition, some resorts offer frequent-skier cards that give you discounts during the days that you ski. Buy these in advance for extra savings.Thanks to the Internet, you can buy these online from ski resorts. Some may limit these offerings as the season progresses.
The downside of these options is that the resort will often restrict what days you can use them.
 The cost of skiing equipment adds up. If you ski a lot, you can invest in secondhand equipment or buy from a store sale. Otherwise, try to borrow equipment from someone you know or rent it from the resort in advance.Like lift tickets and ski cards, go online to the resort’s website. Many resorts let you reserve the equipment you need at a cheaper price than in person.
 Many times you’ll show up at a resort and have to pay more than you’d like to eat there. Restaurant costs can also add up when you’re unfamiliar to an area. Instead, get your own food. Visit a nearby market and pick up groceries or pre-made food. Make sandwiches and bring them with you in a lunch box to the resort. Frequent fast food and pizza joints to cut your food expenses.Self-catering apartments are good options for families and groups.
 Skiing can lead to injuries. Rather than sink under medical costs in case of an emergency, speak with an insurance agent. Compare prices and check details on plans. You can often buy insurance for one or multiple trips or for winter sports.European countries may have extra insurance. For example, UK residents can apply for a free European Health Insurance Card that guarantees cheaper or even free care in European Economic Areas.

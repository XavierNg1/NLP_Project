 Remove any dirt from the skin. Cut out any blemishes.;
, You will be slicing the potatoes very thinly––you won’t need to peel unless you have a total aversion to potato skin.
 You can hand slice the potatoes or use a mandolin. The mandolin will produce the most even results.


Keep the mandolin guard in place when using this device. If not used properly, it can slice fingers too.
Slice potatoes using the 1.33 setting for crisp but hearty chips.
 Once all the potatoes have been sliced, drain the bowl and rinse the potatoes. Dry the slices on a clean towel and roll pre-cooked chips up until you're ready to cook them.
 Use a large pot and only fill it halfway with the oil, to avoid splatters.


Don’t drop chips into the pot until you know the oil has reached 350ºF/180ºC. If you drop the chips in too soon, they could become soggy as they cook instead of crisp.
 Turn the chips after they’ve been in the oil for over 30 seconds, to brown each side.


Only drop two or three chips into the pot of oil at a time (depending on the size pot you are using). You want each chip to have room to fry and not stick to each other. The amount you can add may vary depending on the size of the pot you're using; just be sure to keep the frying chips separated.






Cook the chips until they're golden brown and the bubbling oil calms. Use chopsticks or tongs to handle frying chips.
 The towels will absorb any excess oil and allow your chips to set before you add salt or any other topping.


Once all of the chips have been fried and drained, transfer them to a large bowl. Toss with a few teaspoons of sea salt and a dash of pepper, tossing the chips around the bowl until each chip is delicately covered.

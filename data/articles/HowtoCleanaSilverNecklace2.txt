 If your jewelry is more tarnished, you may need to get actual jewelry polish to clean the necklace. Alternatively, you can make a paste of baking soda and water and rub it into the necklace as a polish.Another option is half a cup of lemon juice with a tablespoon of olive oil.You can also use toothpaste. The ingredient in the toothpaste that polishes the silver is hydrated silica, so look for that ingredient; tartar control toothpastes will have more of this ingredient. However, whatever you use on your teeth is likely fine for silver,though gel varieties likely won't work as well., Put a small dab of the paste on the necklace. If you have precious or semi-precious stones on your necklace, this method may not be the best one, though you can try to avoid the stone. Just a pea-sized dab should be enough, and you can always add more later., For this part, you can start out just using your fingers, if you'd like, though only do so if you're using a natural paste; grab a microfiber cloth if you're using professional silver polish. Rub the paste into the silver, including the chain if it's also tarnished. Basically, it's like your rubbing soap into the silver, but you're using a paste instead.You can also use a soft-bristled toothbrush (one you're not going to brush with!), but you can end up scratching it if you try to brush too hard., Once the tarnish is mostly gone, run the necklace under water. Carefully wash off all the paste, as any left on will look funny. You can repeat the process, as well, if you didn't manage to get all the tarnish off.

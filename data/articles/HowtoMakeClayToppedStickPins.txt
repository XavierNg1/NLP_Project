 This step is optional but if you want to stick small seed beads or similar onto the clay, do so before it dries.
 Two balls, cones, etc. can be pressed end to end of the stick pin or a round ball can cover the whole end. It all depends on what you're aiming to cover on the stick pin and the best fit for the clay decoration.

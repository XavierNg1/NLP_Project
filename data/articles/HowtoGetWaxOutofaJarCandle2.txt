 This method can get messy, so you will want to protect your counter or table from any spilt wax. You can do this by spreading old towels or newspapers over the surface you will be working on. You can also work on an old baking sheet instead.
 Stick a sharp knife into the candle jar (or any other holder) and start poking the wax, creating small slices and slits. This will help the wax melt faster. It will also help the water get underneath the wax and separate it from the glass.
 Do not fill the jar all the way, however. Eventually, the wax will begin to melt and start floating to the top of the water.
 After a few hours, the water will have cooled down, and the melted wax will have become solid. The only difference is that the wax will now be floating on top of the water, making it easy for you to remove.
 Once the wax has hardened, you should be able to just pop it out. Keep in mind that the water may also spill out of the jar while you are doing this.
 You should be able to remove the wick holder by slipping a knife under it and pop it off. If it doesn't come off easily, simply pour more boiling water over it, and try to remove it again why the water is still hot., If there is any wax still left inside the jar, you should be able to remove it by scraping it off with a knife. You could also wash the jar using soap and warm water. Another way to remove wax residue is by soaking a cotton ball with baby oil and wiping it over the wax and glass.
 You can now reuse the jar as you like. You can pour fresh wax into it to make another candle, or you can decorate it and store items inside of it.


Consider reusing the wax. You can also melt the old wax down again in a double boiler and use it to make candles or wax melts.

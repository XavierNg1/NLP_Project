The baking dish should be at least twice as wide as the pumpkin so that it can fit two halves.;
, Rinse the pumpkin under cool to lukewarm running water. Scrub it with a vegetable brush to remove any dirt.


Pat dry with clean paper towels.
 Use a heavy serrated knife to saw the pumpkin in half lengthwise, from the stem down to the bottom.


Use a serrated knife since one with a smooth blade is more likely to slip against the tough skin of the pumpkin.
Cut around the stem to remove it, especially if the stem makes it difficult to fit both halves in the baking dish.
Remove the seeds and inner fibers. A serrated grapefruit spoon works best, but you can also scrape them out with a serrated knife or sturdy metal spoon.
 The two halves should be cut-side down.


Cover the two halves with aluminum foil. Loosely wrap the foil over the exterior of the pumpkin halves or spread it over the entire baking dish.
 This should take approximately 90 minutes for a standard sugar pumpkin.


You should be able to stick a fork through the skin of the pumpkin, and the flesh should be soft enough to remove with a spoon.
 Allow the pumpkin halves to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes or until cool enough to touch. Scoop the flesh out using a metal spoon.


You can store the pumpkin as scooped-out chunks, but it is more common to puree or mash it before storing it. Puree the pumpkin flesh with a handheld blender, standard blender, or food processor. Alternatively, mash it using a potato masher.

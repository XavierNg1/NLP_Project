 As your dreads completely lock, you no longer need to hold them in place with rubber bands. Remove the rubber bands from the roots and the tips of the dreads after about 3 months.
 As your dreads mature, the individual hairs begin naturally knotting onto one another. The new growth that comes in will be straight and unknotted, so you'll have to do a little work to incorporate it into the dreads. Use your fingers to rub the new growth, section by section, to encourage it to knot up with the rest of the dreads.


It's not necessary to rub the dreads too often; as your dreads mature, the new growth will naturally knot up about an inch from your scalp.
Be careful not to overwork the hair at your roots, since you may cause it to start falling out.
 Oils and residues built up on the scalp keep the hair straight, preventing it from knotting up with the rest of the dread. Keep the new growth clean and dry so it naturally becomes part of the rest of the dread.
 You don't want anything left behind or it can cause odor.

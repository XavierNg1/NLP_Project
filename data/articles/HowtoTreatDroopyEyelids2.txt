 Eyelids provide external protection for your eyes, but they also serve other important purposes. When you suffer from ptosis, you may find that your eyelids do not perform these functions as well as they used to. The functions of your eyelids include:protecting your eyes from harmful elements, such as dust, debris, harsh light, and others
lubricating and hydrating your eyes by spreading tears over the surface of your eyes when you blink
eliminating irritants by producing excess tears as needed

, Your eyelids have muscles allow you to open and close your eyelids. You also have fat pads in your eyelids that get larger as you age. The aspects of your eyelid anatomy that are affected by ptosis include:Orbicularis oculi. This muscle surrounds your eyes and you use it to make facial expressions. It also connects to several other muscles.
Levator palpebrae superioris. This muscle allows you to lift your upper eyelids.
Fat pads. These pads are located in the crease of your upper eyelids.

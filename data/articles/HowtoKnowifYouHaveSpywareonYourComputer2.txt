 HijackThis is a diagnostic tool for Windows used to detect the presence of spyware. Double-click the installer to run it. Once installed, launch the software.


Other free software like Adaware or MalwareBytes, will also function with a similar process.
 This button is located in the lower right corner under “Other Stuff” and will take you to a list of options for the program.


Here you can toggle important options (like file backups) on or off. Making a backup is a good, safe practice when working with removing files or software. They do take up a small amount of storage space, but the backups can always be removed later by deleting them from the backups folder.
Note that “Make backups before fixing items” is toggled on by default.
 This button replaces the “Config…” button while the configuration menu is open.
 This button is located in the lower left corner and will generate a list of potentially bad files. It is important to note that HijackThis does a quick scan of likely locations for malicious software. Not all of the results will be harmful.
 This will give details about the item and why it was flagged in a separate window. Close the window when you are done reviewing.


Details will typically include the file location, the likely use of the file, and the action to be taken as a fix.
 This button is located in the lower left and the software will either repair or remove the selected file, depending on its diagnosis.


You can fix multiple files at a time by selecting the checkbox next to each file.
Before making any changes, HijackThis will create a backup (by default) so that you can undo your change.
 If you want to undo the changes made by HijackThis, press “Config” in the lower right, then “Backup”. Select your backup file (marked with the date and timestamp it was created) from the list and press “Restore”.Backups persist through different sessions. You can close HijackThis and then restore a file from a backup at a later time.

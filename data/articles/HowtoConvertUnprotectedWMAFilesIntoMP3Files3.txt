 There is no native support for the WMA file format in Mac OS X. The iTunes method above will not work on Mac because Windows Media Player is not present. This means that you will need to download a third-party program from the internet to do the conversion. There are several free options available.



Adapter is one of the more popular freeware options, and is what this guide is based on. It is available for free for PC and Mac.
 You can either drag-and-drop your WMA files into the Adapter window, or you can click the "Browse" button to search your computer for them.
 This is located at the bottom of the window.
, Click the "Same as Source" menu and select where you'd like to save your converted files. You can either save them to a custom directory or import them directly into iTunes.
 The conversion process will begin. The time will vary depending on how many files you are converting.

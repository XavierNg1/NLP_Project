 If you are trying to be paleo on a budget, go for foods that are inexpensive and good for you. Vegetables and fruits are often cheaper than prepackaged foods and fit right into your paleo diet. Go for carrots, onions, celery, cabbage, and cheaper varieties of vegetables. Opt for cheaper fruits like apples and bananas.If you are still struggling to afford fresh fruits and vegetables, you can try buying frozen produce instead. Buying frozen fruit and veggies means you do not have to rush to use it all up or worry that you will waste money on food you won’t have time to eat. Pick up frozen fruit like berries and frozen vegetables like spinach, kale, and peas.
 You can save money on potentially expensive items like meat by buying cheaper cuts and organ meats. Liver, kidneys, heart, and brain are all cheap and full of nutrition. Talk to your local butcher about buying organ meats and then prepare them so they taste delicious.You can also go for cuts of meat that are not as tender but taste just as good once they have been cooked down. Cuts like the shoulder, the hocks, and the shanks are cheaper and taste great once they are slow cooked. You can also use the liquid from the slow cook as broth for soups, stews, and sauces.
 Don’t be scared off by expiration dates, especially if you plan to prepare and eat the food you buy right away. Many foods that are closer to their expiration date will be marked down. You may go for cuts of meat that are close to their “sell by” dates and buy them for dinner that night. Or you may pick up produce that is slightly bruised but still good and buy it for cheap.A big part of the paleo diet is not eating prepackaged foods, which means you may not need to worry too much about expiration dates unless you are eating items like meat or fish. If you notice cuts of meat or fish that are close to their sell by date and are on sale, do pick them up.

, Carpenter bees are about 3/4 inch to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.54 cm) in length.
 Females have black heads, and males have white markings on their heads.
, Carpenter bees will seek out wood, and will often fly close to it, examining it for possible nesting. A bee that is boring or coming in and out of a hole is creating the nesting area. Male carpenter bees will often hover, protecting the female while she is working.
 Carpenter bees enjoy a range of soft and hardwoods, and particularly like wood that is weathered. Look for carpenter bees in firewood and lawn furniture. Along your house, carpenter bees will try to bore into the bare wood near the roof, such as in eaves, gables and fascia. If you have had carpenter bees nest in an area of your house before, bees in the same place will likely be carpenter bees, as they like to return to old nesting sites.

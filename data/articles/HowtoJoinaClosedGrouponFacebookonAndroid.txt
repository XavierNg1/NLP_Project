 This will be right below the group's cover photo after you tap Join Group. You can browse a list of similar groups here, and maybe find another group you might want to join.
 If you have a friend who's already a member of a closed group, they might be able to add you without a join request or admin approval. Talk to your friends and find out if they can add you to a closed group.

 After you apply your eyeliner, take a similarly-colored eyeshadow and use a thin brush to sweep a layer of eyeshadow over your eyeliner. For instance, if you used black eyeliner, use a matte black eyeshadow .This seals your liner and prevents it from running or smudging. Make sure not too use to much eyeshadow or a brush that is too large. You want just enough to cover and seal your liner; you should not even be able to tell that you have used eyeshadow.
Do not use glittery eyeshadow to seal eyeliner. Glitter can seriously irritate your eyes and is best for lids, not the area around your eyes. , Makeup sealers work by drying over your eyeliner so that it stays set. They are usually clear so that the sealer does not interfere with the color of your liner. You can find makeup sealer at stores like Sephora, Ulta or Target. , If you do not have a makeup sealer and would rather not purchase one, just use Vaseline to seal your eyeliner. Take a Q-tip, pick up a dab of Vaseline, then pat it over your eyeliner. This functions in the same way as a sealer and will prevent your liner from running. , If you usually use mascara, make sure to use a waterproof mascara after applying your liner and sealer. Waterproof mascara can help your eyeliner from shifting around and smudging. , Setting sprays use a mist formula to set your makeup. Once you have applied your liner and the rest of your eye makeup, close your eyes. Take the setting spray, hold it about a foot away from your eyes, and give your eyes one spray. Allow the setting spray to dry, and if there is excess moisture, blot carefully with a clean paper towel.

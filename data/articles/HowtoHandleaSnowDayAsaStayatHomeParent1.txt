 A snow day is a fun day to engage with your child, but it is important to manage your time so you can complete your own tasks. When you child is home unexpectedly, review your schedule for the day and consider where you can make adjustments.Push back non-essential household chores until the following day to free up some time to play with your child in the snow.
Consider ordering take-out for dinner so you donâ€™t have to spend time cooking.;
, Juggle your responsibilities and spend time with your child by multitasking. Perhaps you can complete your telecommuting work while your child watches some morning cartoons or their favorite movie. Have your child work on an art project at the kitchen table while you complete some work next to them on your laptop. Your child will enjoy working alongside you.
 If you have a lot of work and need some time to yourself to complete it, consider asking a friend, a family member, or a neighbor for help. Ask a friend if they would like to babysit and offer to provide them with lunch and dinner. Call a neighbor and ask if your child and theirs would like to play together for a few hours in the afternoon. Your child will be entertained and supervised while you are able to complete your tasks.

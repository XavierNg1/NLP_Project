 The AT4, Stinger, and Javelin are all launchers that can lock on to and destroy vehicles.;
, Wait until you hear a message along the lines of "Enemy UAV spotted!"

, Go to a safe area where you can see most of the sky. Assuming the enemy has a UAV in the air, look up at around 45 degree angle you should see a small black or white drone. This should be the enemy's UAV.
 Equip your launcher if you haven't already. Look down the sight at the UAV. You will hear a steady beeping noise. When the steady beep changes to a constant tone, it means that you are locked on and ready to fire.
 If you locked on correctly, the missile should home in towards the UAV and destroy it. Well done.
 This works best with the perk Stopping Power Pro

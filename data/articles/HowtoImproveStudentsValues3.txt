 This is one of the hardest values to install in anyone, let alone a pupil. However, exercise is useful in getting the blood pumping and helping the pupil to learn, so firstly consider what type of exercise is best (e.g. cardio, stamina, strength) and then times and agreements with parents and pupils should be made. Also think about interesting types of activities, such as fencing.
 It may sound old fashioned but posture helps to stop back pain (which can interfere with learning and make a pupil grumpy), aid breathing and improve a host of other things. A simple technique is to but a medium weight book on the pupils head and tape a straight line on the floor. Another technique is to imagine a piece of string tied to your head and pulling your head up.
 Encourage students to speak loudly and clearly. For soft-spoken students, be encouraging and positive, so they don't feel shy. "I'd love to hear what you have to say. Please speak up to make it easier for me." Encourage students to take their time while writing, and write large enough to read. A positive atmosphere will help them bloom.


If a student has a speech impediment, or seems to have trouble turning thoughts into words, this may mean a disability. Public schools can offer speech therapy services for this.
Poor handwriting may also indicate a disability.
 Don't shame them for being too fat, too curvy, too dark-skinned, or too disabled. Teach all students that their body is strong and deserving of love. When students love their bodies, they will respect them and treat them well.

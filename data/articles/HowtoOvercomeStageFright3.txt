 Even if your hands feel like silly putty and your heart is racing, just act like the coolest person in the world. Walk with your head high and a big smile on your face, and don't tell anyone how nervous you are. Maintain this posture when you get on the stage and you'll actually start to feel confident.


Look straight ahead instead of down at the floor.
Don't slouch.
 Come up with a fail-proof ritual for the day of your performance. This could be a three-mile jog on the morning of your performance, the same "last meal" before your performance, or even singing a certain song in the shower or putting on your lucky socks. Do whatever it is you have to do to gear yourself toward success.


A lucky charm is a great part of a ritual. It could be a piece of jewelry that's important to you, or a silly stuffed animal that cheers you on from your dressing room.
 Focus on all of the amazing results of your presentation or performance instead of everything that can go wrong. Combat every negative thought with five positive ones. Keep an index card with motivational phrases in your pocket, or do whatever you need to do to focus on all of the benefits that the performance will give you instead of honing in on all of the fear and anxiety that you may be feeling.
 If you have a friend who is a knockout performer, whether it's from stage acting or giving presentations, ask for their advice. You may learn some new tricks and will be comforted by the fact that almost everyone gets stage fright, no matter how confident he or she may appear on stage.

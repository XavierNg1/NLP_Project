 If you are trying to keep the snails in your traps alive, you should remove them from the bottom of the wooden trap by hand. Hold the snails by the shell and gently pull them off the wooden trap so you do not come in contact with the slimy mucus on the snail. This will also ensure you are move the snails to a different area safely.Keep in mind if you use a beer trap, the snails will likely all be dead in the trap due to drowning. You may not want to use this trap if you would like to catch snails live.
 Garden snails can make great pets for kids, as they are quiet, low-maintenance, and they are not expensive to feed or maintain. You will need a glass or plastic enclosure that has deep walls and a lid to keep your pet snail.The snail may retract into its shell when you pick it up but if you place it in an enclosure that contains substrate and moss, it will often come out of its shell on its own.
 If you have any dead snails in your trap, you should dispose of them so the trap stays clean. You may scrape any dead snails off of your wooden trap with a shovel or a garden tool or crush any live snails with your foot. You should then set the trap back up so it can catch more snails.If you are using a trap made with yeast, you should fish out the snails and crush them. You should then replace the beer or yeast solution in the trap and set them up again so you can catch more snails.

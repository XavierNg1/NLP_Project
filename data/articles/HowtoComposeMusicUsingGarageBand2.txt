 The default instrument is "Grand Piano", but you have a vast array of instruments to choose from. When you add a new track, a full menu of these will be available on the right side of the screen.


To bring up or hide this menu, click the "i" icon in the lower right corner.
 You can play music using whatever instrument you choose by using the on-screen keyboard available in GarageBand. To make the keyboard visible, select "Window > Keyboard" or hold "Command+K". Simply click on the keyboard's keys with your mouse to play music.


You can also use the "Musical Typing" option, which allows you to play music with your computer's keyboard rather than with the mouse. For this option, select "Window > Musical Typing" or hold "Shift+Command+K". You can also switch to this mode from "Keyboard" mode by clicking the "A" icon in the top left of the keyboard.






In both of these modes, the part of the miniature keyboard highlighted in blue is the octave that you are currently in. You can adjust the octave by clicking on a different part of the miniature keyboard.
 To record, press the round red button near the bottom of the screen. Then, using the "Keyboard" or "Musical Typing" window, begin to play. When you start recording, a bar for that track will appear next to the icon with the name and picture of the instrument. As long as you are recording, this bar will be red, and will keep growing out to the right. When you are finished recording that track, press the red record button again. The bar for that track will now change from red to green.

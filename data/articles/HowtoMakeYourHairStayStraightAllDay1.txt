 Just about every inexpensive brand of hair washing products has a line of products for encouraging straight hair, including brands like Garnier and Pantene.









Take the time to comb the conditioner into your hair while in the shower before your rinse it out to get rid of tangles and encourage straightness.;
, Pat and squeeze your hair dry with your towel rather than ruffling or intensely rubbing your hair dry to prevent frizz from occurring.
 Choose an anti-frizz product containing silicone to help seal in your hair's natural moisture.

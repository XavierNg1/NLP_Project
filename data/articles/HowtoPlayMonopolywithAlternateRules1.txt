 If you land on an unclaimed space that you can either not afford or choose not to buy, the official rules state that you must have an auction for that property. However, many people either:


Let the person decline purchasing the property without any action.
Ban that person from purchasing that property if they land on it again while it is unclaimed.;
, Pay all fees to the bank (such as from a Chance or Community Chest) to the middle of the board. The next person to land on Free Parking collects the pot in the middle. Add some money (usually $50 or $500) so anyone who lands on Free Parking doesn't leave empty handed.
 You could also collect double money for landing on GO, which would be $400. The amount you receive for landing on Go should be decided before the game starts., Make players pay fees for random offenses. These offenses should be decided before the beginning of the game. The fees could involve dice. For example, if someone makes a sloppy dice roll, then make them pay $50 to the center of the board. If someone rolls the dice off of the table, make them pay $50 or $100. The rules can be made up by the players and be as random as anyone that knocks over a real estate piece has to pay a fine., Typically, real estate owners have to keep an eye on other players to see who lands on their property. If the real estate owner doesn’t catch a player landing on the property, then the player doesn’t have to pay. Play an honest game by requiring everyone to pay rent, even if the real estate owner doesn’t see that the player has landed on the real estate.

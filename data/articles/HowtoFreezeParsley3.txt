 Parsley freezes beautifully in the form of pesto, a blend of herbs, oil and nuts. Making pesto is a great way to preserve the bright flavor of parsley in the form of a convenient sauce that can be used to top pasta, salad, meat, or fish. To make pesto, do the following:Wash and chop 2 cups of parsley.
Blend 1 cup walnuts or cashews, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, 3 cloves garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor.
Add 1/2 cup olive oil while the processor is running.
Add the parsley and blend until smooth.
 Put the amount you'll use per meal in individual bags, so it will be easy to grab one and thaw it out when you need one.
 Stack them flat until they are frozen solid. Once they are frozen, you can store them upright to create more room in the freezer.

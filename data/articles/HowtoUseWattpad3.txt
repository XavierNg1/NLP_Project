 Go into the writing option, which is the icon with the pencil. This will bring you to your previous writings once you start a few titles. Only your library can access works without WIFI. The writing section requires WIFI., Select 'Create new story' to make a new story or, if you've already started a story, click 'Edit another story'.
 Make a title, add a description (optional), add a cover (optional), and then you'll be able to write your first part (it'll take you straight to the draft of your first part)., Unfortunately, there isn’t a step on how to write a story. Write what you want and don’t concern yourself with what other people think. Get your ideas out at any expense. This should be a fun process, not a discouraging process.
 When you want to take a break from writing, press the save button. This will be saved into your writing section. Click on the story when you want to continue, and click on the draft with the title. For example, if you want to continue a draft titled "Chapter One" then you click on the draft that is titled "Chapter One".
 You can publish as a way to save your work. Know that when you publish your writing on Wattpad, it’ll become accessible to the Wattpad community. Some people like this option so they can receive criticism for their work as they write.

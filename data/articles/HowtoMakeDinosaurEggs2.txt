 Once the dough dries, you can have fun cracking the eggs open to “hatch” the toys. Small plastic dinosaurs can be found in many toy stores.
 Make sure that the dry ingredients are thoroughly and evenly mixed. This will make the base for a dough.
 Stir as you pour just a little bit at a time. The exact amount of water to add depends on the type of dirt you are using and the humidity in your area. In any case, stir in enough water that the dry ingredients stick together so that they can be formed into egg-shaped clumps.
 Make sure to completely enclose each dinosaur. Using your hands, form the clump of dough into an egg shape.


You can dip your fingers in water and rub them over the eggs to smooth them out, if you want., Leave them in a safe, dry place while you wait.


Dry your eggs in the sun if it is warm in your area, but bring them in at night.
Rotating your eggs occasionally can help them dry evenly.
You can speed the drying process by placing the eggs in an oven set to 200 degrees Fahrenheit for approximately 4 hours, turning them every half hour. After the first hour, set the eggs on a rack on top of a baking sheet to help them dry more evenly., You can have fun by hiding the dinosaur eggs in your yard or a park, then letting children hunt for them and crack them open.

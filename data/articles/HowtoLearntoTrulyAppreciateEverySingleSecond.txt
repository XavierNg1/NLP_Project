 Write a list of all the things in your life you are blessed in having: shelter, food, clean water, health etc. Include things that bring you pleasure too. Whether it's watching your favourite t.v. show or smelling freshly cut grass. Once you get started on this list, you'll be pleasantly surprised at just how much you have.;
, What things have you always wanted to do but are yet to attempt? What can you realistically try? For example, maybe you've always wanted to watch the sunrise or take up a new class. Once you have this list, make the effort to do something on it, maybe one a month, one every six months... Just make sure you try it. Find a combination of things that are free of charge and some that cost. That way, if you're broke, you can try something that won't cost. You'll have no excuse not to.
 One fantastic way of appreciating the beauty that's around you is to take the time each day to take one single photograph. The camera doesn't have to be top quality and you don't have to be a great photographer. If you limit yourself to one photograph, you'll really stop and look hard at what's around you.
 It's too easy to text or e-mail. Have a conversation every now and then! Hearing their voice, actually seeing them, makes the communication much more satisfying. Appreciating other people who are there for you is key to appreciating life.

;
, Then pour in 1 tablespoon of coconut oil.
 The spray is now ready for use.
, Spray your hair until itâ€™s nice and moist.
 Also, if you have super frizzy hair, then use an anti-frizz serum, in order to control the frizz.
 If you want more of a wave, let your hair dry in the sunlight, if possible.
, It is recommended that you grind the flakes between your fingers a little first, as this will help them to dissolve faster.


Depending on how little or much water your bottle will hold, add a suitable amount of salt: as a rough guide, use about 4 oz for every 8oz water. You can use more for an even more beachy look.
 Use about 1/2 a teaspoon for every 8 oz water, or a little more if your hair is naturally very dry. However, don't use too much, otherwise it will not mix properly with the water.
 If you want, throw in an essential oil of your choice. These are great for sensitive scalps, and your hair. Or, you could use cold chamomile tea instead, which will lighten your hair over time. Use about 1 teaspoon.


Always check the contra-indications of essential oils before using, just to be safe.
 Fill the bottle with water, screw the cap on tight and then shake to combine all the ingredients. Now you're ready to apply!

, The great thing about this spray is that it can be used on damp or dry hair.


Soaking hair isn't suitable as the spray will probably just drip off.
 This means it's great to use at the beach when you come out of the sea, if you don't get beachy waves naturally.

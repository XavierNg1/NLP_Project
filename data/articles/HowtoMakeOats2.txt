 Pour the rolled oats into the bowl of a food processor. Gently shift the machine from side to side, distributing the oats into an even layer.Use either freshly rolled oats or store-bought rolled oats for this process.
Keeping the oats in an even layer will make it easier for the blades to reach the separate oats at a consistent pace.
If you do not have a food processor, you could use a blender, instead.
 Quickly pulse the oats four or five times, or until they appear coarsely chopped. Do not wait until the oats turn into powder.Operate the machine in short bursts. Each burst should last no longer than one or two seconds.
You can still use the oats for oatmeal if you accidentally grind them down into powder, but the resulting consistency will be mushy instead of chunky.
 Gently stir the oats with a spoon. If there are still large, pieces of oats in the bowl of the machine, pulse the batch again.

Before pulsing the oats again, make sure that the larger pieces are positioned directly next to the blades. Try to stir the smaller pieces further away from the blades to prevent them from breaking down into powder.
If you work in small batches, you may not need a second round of pulsing.
 You can use these quick-cooking oats immediately or store them in an airtight container until needed.

If you're starting with freshly rolled oats, try to use these quick-cooking oats immediately since they will retain more flavor and nutrients.
If you're starting with store-bought rolled oats, you should be able to store these quick-cooking oats in an airtight container at room temperature or in your refrigerator. Mark the container with the expiration date indicated on the original container of rolled oats.

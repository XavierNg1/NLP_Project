 Our feelings flow from our thoughts. So replace negative thoughts with truth: that God loves you and has promised you strength for the trials of life, and his presence. Rather than just stewing in your own doubts and fear, focus on the promises of God found in the Bible. (for example, read 2 Corinthians 4:8).;
, Act as if you have more faith than you do. Imitate those whose faith you admire. Your actions may transform your attitude. Use people who have strong faith as your role models. If you don’t know any, you can find inspiring stories of people of faith in the Bible. In his book Always True (Moody Publishers, 2011), pastor James MacDonald offers this: “Is the spark and passion you used to have replaced by lethargy and apathy? That’s not what God wants for you, says Hebrews 6:12. He wants you to be 'imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.'” (p. 48) Who are those inheritors of promise? The heroes of the faith whose stories are in the Bible.
 Don’t be afraid to talk to others. You’re not the only one who wrestles with doubt and lagging faith. Talking honestly with others about your faith is the first step toward reviving it when you are in a season of sluggish faith. And who knows, you might end up encouraging someone else who felt alone in their doubt.
 Talk to God about your questions and doubts. It’s not like you’re fooling him—God already knows how you feel, but praying about it can be the first step toward revival. One man who encountered Jesus told him, “I do believe, help my unbelief!” Just praying about our struggles will help us experience God's love. MacDonald writes: “if in times of doubt we take our questions directly to the Lord, then our faith increases. We can’t claim we won’t doubt; instead, we aim toward knowing what to do with doubts when they do come at us.” (p. 55)

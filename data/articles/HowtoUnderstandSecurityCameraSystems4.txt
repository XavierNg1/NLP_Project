 Each camera takes power and video. Simply plug in both sides of the Siamese coax cable (the power and video) to the cameras. You should be able to mix and match any cameras desired for your application. If your cameras utilize the Sony Super HAD CCD, this should provide superior video quality. Check that your high resolution cameras include:


Infrared Day/Night (color during the day, black and white and infrared viewing in complete darkness.)
Dome Security Cameras (a favorite for indoor applications)
Bullet Security Cameras (size of a finger "thus called bullet.")
Box Security Cameras (you see in banks a lot)
PTZ Security Camera (Controllable Pan Tilt Zoom Cameras such as the airport) These cameras are more expensive generally speaking.
Hidden Cameras (smoke detector, motion sensor, clocks)

Some cameras can be used outdoor or indoor. This will be specified on the product. Never use an indoor camera outdoor or there will eventually be video issues.

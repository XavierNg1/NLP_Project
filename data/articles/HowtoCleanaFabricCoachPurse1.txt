, Choose a corner on one side to start the cleaning process. You want to make sure that you cover the entire surface of the handbag, so work your way out from the corner. You will do each side individually, followed by the handle, and the bottom. You should do the bottom of the purse last because it encounters the most grime., Work your way across the fabric, making circular movements as you apply the water. Don’t linger on one spot. Keep your sponge moving so that you don’t create water spots.Don’t get your sponge too wet because you don’t want to apply too much water.

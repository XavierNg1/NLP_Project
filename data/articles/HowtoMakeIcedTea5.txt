 This version is especially suitable for sweet-tooths and outdoor grilling in the Southern United States. Sugar never dissolves completely in cold tea. To make this variation of tea, you can follow the recipe for making simple black iced tea, except you should add 1 cup of simple syrup for every 2 cups of water of the finished iced tea mixture. If that doesn't taste sweet enough, just add more.









This tea tastes excellent when it's garnished with mint.
 To make this citrus-flavored tea, begin by making ordinary black tea by boiling 2 cups of water, steeping 3-5 tea bags in it for 5 minutes, and pouring 2 cups of water into the mix. Then, squeeze the juice from a lemon to fill 1/2 a cup with lemon juice. Stir this into the cooled mix. If that's not lemony enough, just add a bit more. Serve this tea over ice with sugar to taste and a sprig of mint.
 Brew 2 cups of ordinary black tea. Let the tea cool down and add 1 cup of cold water; some ice cubes are fine too. Add 2 teaspoons of vanilla essence (extract). Serve with a spoonful of vanilla ice-cream.

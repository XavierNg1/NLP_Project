 Chemical peels can be used in cases of hyperpigmentation, where the skin produces too much melanin and dark patches and age spots appear on the face. Visit your doctor to find out if you need to make any preparations for your chemical peel. These can include stopping certain medications, and determining the depth of your chemical peel.

 Peeling usually involves a first stage of redness, followed by a second stage of scaling that ends within 3-7 days.

This type of treatment can result in uneven pigmentation or can reveal a skin tone that is substantially different from your natural tone. , This peel will exfoliate the outer layers of dead skin, revealing skin with improved tone, texture, and color.

 Place your index finger flat over all six strings on your guitar to create a bar that will press down on all strings evenly. Make sure your finger is as close to the fret as possible without being on top of it.








Roll your finger onto its side a bit, don't just lay it flat. The tip of your finger should extend over the edge of the fretboard.
You may need to experiment a little moving your wrist around until you find the most comfortable position for you. Make sure you're pinching the neck of the guitar very hard with your thumb so your barre finger stays straight and firm across the strings.
 The G major barre chord is part of the E family of barre chords. Since you've barred your guitar at the third fret, making an E major chord shape results in a G major barre chord.Place your pinkie on the D string at the fifth fret, your ring finger on the A string at the fifth fret, and your middle finger on the G string at the fourth fret.
 Once you've got your fingers in place, strum all six strings openly to play the chord. Make sure all strings are vibrating cleanly and there aren't any strings muted or muffled.








You may want to strum slowly across all six strings to check the sound from each string.
Make sure your non-barre fingers are curled, so that you're only fretting with your fingertips.
Keep in mind that it takes a lot of practice to play a barre chord successfully. Don't give up if you find it difficult at first.

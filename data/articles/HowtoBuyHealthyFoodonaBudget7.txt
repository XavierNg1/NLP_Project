 In season foods are less expensive and taste better too. If fresh produce is not available, frozen and some canned options are suitable substitutes. If you happen to catch a sale, it may turn out to be better on your budget in the long run, as you don’t run the risk of spoilage. Avoid foods that have syrup and salt added to them.
 These are usually less healthy and more expensive. You will do far better to make your own soup than to buy the commercially packaged product. Your ingredient choices can be healthier and the quantity it will produce will surpass the packaged product, giving you a better value.
 The total cost for these items will be less while also giving you a healthier option, as most produce begins to slowly lose some of it’s nutritional value once it has been sliced or cut.

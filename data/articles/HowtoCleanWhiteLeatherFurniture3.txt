 Melamine makes these sponges denser than regular cleaning sponges. They also have pores that serve a dual purpose. They absorb any cleaning solution they’re put into contact with and give the sponge a slight abrasive quality. These make them more effective for cleaning marks and stains. You can buy these sponges in bulk on eBay and other online stores.


You can buy these sponges under the Mr. Clean brand; they come already soaked with cleaning solution. Otherwise you can buy the sponges in bulk and soak them in homemade cleaning solutions.You can also use a cloth instead of a melamine sponge, but be aware it won’t clean as deeply as a sponge. Use a clean rag; any dirt on it could leak out into your cleaning solution., Make sure to squeeze any excess solution. Your sponge should be damp, holding enough solution to clean your surface. It shouldn’t be leaking. Wipe the leather gently, since the sponge’s abrasiveness could damage the leather’s coating if too much pressure is used.


You use a cloth for this step. Note that since a cloth is less abrasive than a melamine sponge, you can use a bit more pressure as you clean., This includes stitching, creases and crevices where the various parts of the furniture meet. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and make sure to scrub gently. You can dip the toothbrush in your cleaning solution to dislodge any spots on the couch.
 Leaving any cleaning solution on leather for an extended period can damage the surface. Wipe thoroughly until the surface is completely dry.

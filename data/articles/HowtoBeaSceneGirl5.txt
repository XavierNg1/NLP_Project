 The most important thing you should do with your hair is part it to the side, with bangs sweeping in front of your face instead. Little girl clips and dying your hair multiple colors are the classic style, but new styles are emerging, such as brunette Scene hair which I think is amazing! Also,you don't have to have long hair to be scene just tease the top of your hair and put your bangs to the side.
,, It is very simple to do if you want something not too extreme. You want long straight hair, of any color, and bangs that go straight across your forehead hanging in front of your eyes some.
 They sell for very cheap at most stores. Straighten your hair so it doesn't have any waves, and then make it look like it's layered. Your bangs can either be off to the side, of hanging down straight over your eyes.
,,, Dye it black or platinum blond. Or you can do an unusual or rare color like red. If you go completely black be careful, because you could come off as an emo. So if you go black put some neon colored chunks in it. Any other dark color will do (maroon, purple, or red). You can also have dark chocolate brown hair (it works just as well).
 Extreme colors have gradually become more popular so don't be afraid to try a risky move.

 When planning river, lake or sea trips, do not assume that your dog has boundless energy and can swim for hours on end. Dogs can easily drown when swimming in fast-moving water as it will exhaust them., This way you know your dog is safe and that if they do go under, you can pull them up.
 Dogs do not sweat and cool themselves through their paw pads and panting. A cooling vest uses evaporative cooling to release heat.

 This will make the cake easier to eat. The mug needs to be large, about 12 to 16 ounces (350 to 475 milliliters). If it's too small, the cake may overflow when you cook it.


If you don't have cooking spray, lightly grease the mug with butter or cooking oil.;
, Pour the flour, sugar, and baking powder into the mug. For a less-sweet cake, add in a pinch of salt. Stir everything together with a fork.
 Pour the milk into the mug. Add the vegetable oil and the vanilla extract. Stir everything together with a spoon, scraping the bottom and sides of the mug often.

For a vegan version, use a non-dairy milk.
 You don't have to do this if you are making a regular vanilla cake. If you ant to make a birthday or "funfetti" cake, however, then consider adding in 2 teaspoons of sprinkles. The round, confetti type would work the best., It would be best if you heat the cake at 70 to 80% power instead of full power.
 After 2 to 3 minutes, the cake will be cool enough to eat. You can eat it straight from the mug, or dump it out onto a plate.

For a fancier cake, serve it with whipped cream or ice cream. You can also serve it with strawberry or raspberry jam.

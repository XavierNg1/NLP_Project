 If you want to juggle fire at night when it's more impressive (you do), then you should practice juggling ordinary clubs at night. If you're busy at night or it's daytime and you're impatient, close your eyes. When you juggle fire, it's a lot harder to see the handle because it's just not nearly as bright as the fire. Imagine juggling with clubs whose handles are basically invisible.;
, No matter how safe you assure people this is, some people just naturally worry about their building or wildlife catching on fire. In general, do not do this inside, near dry grass, on school grounds, or in a crowded area.
 And put your bucket in a larger bucket. Dipping your torches into a bucket of fuel is a lot easier than trying to squirt it on. Any fuel that drips off your torches should run into the bottom of the larger bucket. Put a lid on your fuel to prevent it from drying up., A fire extinguisher and a bucket of water are good, but it's also a good idea to have spotters on hand with fire blankets just in case. They are commonly called duvetyne blankets. You probably won't need them but just in case.
 After dipping in the fuel, give them a good shake. Aim this shake toward the ground! If you don't do this, you run the risk of splattering everyone with fire. Do this away from where you plan to be lighting the torches. You don't want to accidentally drop and end up setting the ground around you alight.
 Light one torch first, either with a lighter or from someone else' torch. Hold it in front of you, pointed up, and light the other two.
 If you do this right, you will now be confronted with spinning fire right in front of your face. Don't be afraid of this. Juggle normally, and concentrate on your catches.
 Picking up a fallen torch is a lot more fun than catching the fire in your hand. Get out of the way.

If your version of Word does not offer brochure templates, go to Microsoft.com’s Templates area and choose Brochures.
, Simply click inside an area of text to modify it. In addition to the actual wording, you can also change the font and coloring, for example.



Don’t forget to replace all the example text; leaving text that says “Insert description here” will make your brochure look extremely unprofessional. To make absolutely sure you haven’t missed anything, change the color of any text you’ve modified so that the leftovers stick out like a sore thumb. When you’re done, you can change all the font back if you want.



Click on the example image.
Delete the existing image by pressing Delete.
Go to Insert and choose Picture.
Browse for a desired image and click Insert.
Wait for the picture to appear. Note that it will probably show up in a size and location that is far from ideal.
Click and drag the corners of the image to resize it. Click and drag the image itself to move it to the correct area.
 Add/change the background color, move the text and image boxes around by clicking and dragging, add borders, and so on.



To explore the formatting options for any area of the page (text box, image box, background), simply right-click it and choose any formatting/modification options that pop up in the menu.

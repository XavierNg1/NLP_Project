 "Setting" here means creating tension in your body while you're in the starting position so you use your muscles when you pull the bar up. It's a bit like clenching your body; you don't want to be like a wet noodle at all because then you might pull a muscle or hurt a joint.


Always make sure your back is completely flat and straight. If there is any kind of bend in your back, you need to do some flexibility work before deadlifting. If you have someone record you in starting position, you'll be able to see whether your back is straight or not.
Some people hold their head in line with their back, others look straight ahead, and some people look up at the ceiling.
 Raise your hips and shoulders at the same rate while maintaining a flat back. Keep your abs tight during the whole lift.


Begin the movement by pushing through your heels and straightening your knees.
The bar should drag along your shins on the way up--that's why a lot of people who deadlift wear pants or knee-high socks, and if they don't, they often have bruises or scrapes to show for it.
Come to a standing position with upright posture and your shoulders pulled back (don't let your shoulders cave forward, think of always pinching your shoulders back together and sticking your chest up and out). Don't bend backwards at all, just stand up straight.
Engage (squeeze) your hamstrings and glutes to pull the bar up.
 Keeping your back straight, return the bar to the starting position in a controlled manner. Push your butt out as if you are going to sit down in a chair. Do not arch your back or curl your tailbone under.


Release the weight after it is on the ground.

 Most signs of arthritis are related to mobility. Often one particular joint is affected more than the others, and this can lead to your dog limping or standing with less weight on the sore leg than his other legs.However, in the early stages, your dog can often run freely and forget about the discomfort when he sees something to chase after. Therefore, it can appear that the lameness comes and goes and is worse before a walk than during the walk.
A dog with arthritis has a tendency to be worse the day after vigorous exercise. He may chase happily after a ball one day, but the next day when the joint is still inflamed, he will often limp more than before.;
, Arthritis can cause your dog to avoid activities she once enjoyed. Your dog may be reluctant to go for her favorite walk or refuse to jump into your vehicle or on furniture., Arthritis causes pain for your dog. Look for whining when he walks. Your dog may also nip at you or seem upset when you touch the affected area., If your dog has an early stage of arthritis, she will often be stiff when she has been resting for a while, such as first thing in the morning or after sleeping. She may spend time stretching and padding around in a stilted way before her joints and muscles warm up and she can move more freely., Pain and discomfort can also affect your dog's mood. Pain can make an animal withdrawn or depressed and change his habits. Pain can also make your dog short-tempered and prone to snapping or aggressive behavior, so a change in his behavior should trigger you to look for an underlying problem, like arthritis.

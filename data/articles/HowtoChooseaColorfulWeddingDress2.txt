 You don't have to have your bold wedding day colors be completely solid. Many white or cream gowns come with decorative embroidery in bolder shades. Think about something like a white gown with bright red embroidery. This can be a great way to have a colorful gown that still honors tradition by incorporating some white.You can coordinate with your bridesmaids with your embroidery colors. For example, if your bridesmaids are wearing purple, go for a dress with purple embroidery.
 If you want to really defy tradition, go for a black gown. If you want a very non-traditional, somewhat eccentric wedding, a solid black gown can work great. However, if you prefer black but want a more subtle effect, black embroidery or black patterns can also work great.Black is a great choice if you want a slimming gown. Many people find black flatters most figures.
Remember, black is a very audacious choice that stands opposite to tradition. Only go for a black gown if you're prepared to make a big statement.
 Floral patterned gowns can be classy for a slightly non-traditional look. They can be used to add big, bold colors to a gown. As a floral pattern is read as very feminine, it can pair great with a ball gown style dress.You can have floral patterns with colors like pinks, purples, greens, and reds against a white background. However, you can also have a colored dress with a floral print. For example, try a floral pattern against a pink background.

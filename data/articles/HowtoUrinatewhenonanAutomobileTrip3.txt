 Just in case the rest stop does not have soap and water, it is a good idea to be prepared. Hand sanitizer or baby wipes are quick and easy solutions to bring with you.You can find hand sanitizer and baby wipes at any big box store (like Walmart) or supermarket. If you do not want to buy the large size you can get the travel size.

Most of them will have warning signs telling you how many miles ahead the rest area is.You can download apps to your phone that locate rest areas near your location. This way, as soon as you know you will need to urinate you can just open the app and find the nearest rest area., When you locate the nearest rest area, pull in and park. You can stretch your legs, take some photos if you are in a scenic area, or just head straight to the restroom.


Many rest areas offer vending machines, pet areas, free coffee, and sometimes free wifi., Whether it is a gender-specific restroom or private restroom, all rest areas offer a restroom with available toilets and/or urinals. If the restrooms are being cleaned, you can either wait a few minutes or drive to the next rest area.


If you are female: Hopefully the restroom is clean and you can sit and do your business. If that is not the case and the restroom is filthy enough that you do not want to sit on the toilet, you can still use it. Stand on top of the toilet seat, squatting into the toilet bowl.
 If there are soap and water in the rest area restroom, clean yourself up using those. If the rest area does not provide soap and water, you can use the cleaning supplies you brought with you.
 Keep going toward your destination, making sure to drink enough water on the way. Dehydration can cause you to fall asleep at the wheel, which is dangerous.

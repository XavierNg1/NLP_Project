 The cost in money and time can get pretty expensive if you want to make a big, high quality ramp.;
, You may want to see existing jumps online or in person to get a feel for your desired size.
 If it is in a field or other out-of-the-way place, a plain dirt-ramp might be your best bet.
 For small, mobile ramps, a low-traffic street or if you have a nice big driveway/car repair lot. Nothing is worse than building a great jump and coming back the next week and it's destroyed by an angry property owner, or the cops!

a 'rhythm section' (link your jumps together to create clean and flowing lines)

For a jump with a gap, toss the dirt before or after the gap.
For no gap or a shallow gap, dig to one side or the other side of the trail.
 Keep in mind the landing doesn't have to be as big as the jump. For a table top pile all the dirt in one spot then shape it out to form a top.
 Take your shovel and shape the jump ramp in sort of a concave curve, this gives you more air and you get high, which equals more distance. Take your time so it looks good and works right, make sure not to make it so steep you flip when you hit it. You want the jump and catch to be fairly wide so you have a better chance of hitting it well.
 Think about the landing and shape it accordingly.
 If your front tire comes up too quick then take some of the curve out by adding dirt to the middle or off the top, if you're over shooting the landing, you may want to move the catch ramp.

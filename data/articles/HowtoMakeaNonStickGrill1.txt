 If not, clean it well before starting the barbecue.;
, Use an oil able to tolerate high levels of heat well (high smoke point), such as peanut, canola or grapeseed oils.


However, some disagree that the oil should be added to the grill, such as Meathead Goldwyn, who advises adding the oil to the meat and not to the grill.You may prefer to follow this advice.
 The grill should be hot before adding food to it. The combination of a clean grill, oil and heat will help keep the grill non-stick.


If cooking meat, it helps to warm it to room temperature just before adding it to the barbecue.






If grilling fish, it's better if the skin is left on, to keep the fish intact.
 If it is sticking, this is an indication that it hasn't yet seared properly.
 You can do this after or before cooking, whichever you prefer, as long as it gets done.

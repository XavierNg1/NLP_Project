 It needs to be a fairly large space, measuring about 20 by 20 feet long and wide.


Put the two trash cans against the wall and about five feet away from each of the trash cans.
Place the two buckets measuring about five feet or more apart. Place a piece of tape in a straight line behind the buckets, then place tape in a straight line down the center as well, so as to create two separate "courts".
Fill the buckets with plastic bottles, ready for tossing.
 Do a few test throws, to check that you haven't made the placement of the trash cans too easy or impossible. Shuffle the trash cans about a little if needed., Have the first players stand in place behind the taped line. Get ready to start timing the game., The players must start tossing the plastic bottles into the empty trash cans in front of them., The player with the most bottles in the trash can wins.

Collect the bottles and return them to the buckets for the next game.
 Keep players moving through in pairs. Then pair off the winners from each game until only two people are left to battle it out and win the ultimate prize (whatever that may be).

Have as many rounds as you want. At the end of each round tally how many water bottles you get into the trash and by the end of the rounds whoever has the most points wins the whole game!

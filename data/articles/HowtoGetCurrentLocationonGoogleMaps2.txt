 Look for the Google Maps app on your mobile device and tap on it.
 On the bottom right corner of the screen, you can find the location button. The icon looks like a compass circle.
 The map will adjust based on your current location. Your current location will be identified by a blue dot on the map.


You can now pinch your fingers on the screen to zoom in or out to get a better picture of your current location and surroundings.

 Hold the pipe upside down and gently tap to remove any remaining particles. Then use a pipe cleaner, cotton swab, mechanical pencil, needle, or similarly thin object to remove any large, easily dislodged bits of resin you can reach.


Don't risk breaking the pipe to get at tough spots, as you only need to get anything big and easy to reach off now. This will help the alcohol clean the rest of the pipe faster.;
, Try and purchase 90% isopropyl, as it will clean the pipe faster than the more watered-down 71% solution. Place the pipe inside, making sure it is fully submerged in the fluid.


Alcohol breaks down tar and resin, making it easier to remove and cleaning off stains over time., Salt will act like an abrasive sponge on your pipe, scrubbing away the resin in places you could never reach with a sponge or brush. Because it is meant to rub away the resin, try and use the biggest grains of salt your can find -- course or kosher salt is usually your best bet.
 If possible, get the salt in the pipe and then use your fingers to close off the openings to the pipe. You can then shake up the salt inside the chamber, getting rid of as much resin as possible. Shake the bag for 1-2 minutes or until the pipe is visibly clean., Add a splash of fresh isopropyl and let the pipe sit, submerged in the fluid, for several hours before shaking it up again. If you are using 71% isopropyl alcohol, then some of your salt may have dissolved, so be sure to add more if you seem to be missing some.
 Remove all the alcohol and salt from the pipe with some piping hot water and discard the rest down the toilet, as it can stink up your sink and pipes if left undisturbed., Wipe off any little spots, dipping the end of your tool in some clean alcohol to get rid of any persistent stains. To remove any water marks or non-resin stains, soak the pipe for 10-15 minutes in a mixture of warm water and lemon juice.

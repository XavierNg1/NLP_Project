 For this way of making money you will need:

Noose wand is a must.
Polar camo top and bottom would be helpful.
You'll also need 35 agility to scale some rocks leading to a cave.
 If you do not have this lodestone active then you can walk north of Seers Village, You should find sabre toothed kyatts(level 55-60) keep going north until you find some steps made of ice; ascend the steps and talk to the hunting expert in the area.,

You just need to play dot to dot, if the tracks go in a burrow search the the other burrows in the area until the tracks come out. Their furs sell for roughy 1.5k each and a full inventory is about 42k. This is a great way to make money but it can be slow and boring, just keep in your head every time you catch one you get 1.5.k

Polar kebbits will always hide in snow drifts so always attack the snow drifts!
A good bank to deposit your wares in is Keldagrim (the dwarven city) just south of your area.
If you've been to Keldagrim before by boat, you can get there by using a trap door in the Grand Exchange perimeters. Its at the top left corner near the agility shortcut to Edgeville.

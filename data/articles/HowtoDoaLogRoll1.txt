 Place yourself closer to the head of the bed than to the foot of the bed so that you'll be in the proper position when you lay down. Scoot back as far as you can so that you are not sitting on the edge of the bed.


To determine where you should sit, picture your bed divided into thirds. You should sit within the top 1/3 section of your bed.;
, Move very slowly and keep your body as steady as possible. It is important to keep your spine straight, so use your arms to help guide and control your body.


As you start to lean your body sideways, place your bottom elbow onto the bed underneath your shoulder. Then, place your top hand onto the bed in front of your chest.
As your body reaches the bed, lie on top of your bottom arm, and place your top arm at your side.
 As you're lowering your body onto the bed, bend your knees and pull your legs onto the bed. Keep your knees bent and your legs together as you pull them onto the bed.
 After you've pulled your legs onto the bed, you should end up lying on your side, facing the outside of the bed. Your knees should remain bent, one lying on top of the other.
 Keep you knees bent as you very slowly roll onto your back. Use your bottom arm to push your body onto your back. Be sure to keep your shoulders and hips together as a unit as you roll, so as not to twist your spine or torso. Picture your body as a rolling log.


Your shoulders, hips, and knees should stay aligned at all times. To be sure you're doing this, keep your knees and shoulders pointed in the same direction.
 At this point, you should be lying on your back with your knees bent and pointed toward the ceiling. Your shoulders and hips should be aligned., Slowly slide your legs down so that you are lying completely flat. Avoid any twisting or excessive movement one laying down.

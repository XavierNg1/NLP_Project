 Washing with warm water and soap for 30 seconds is advised, especially before touching your baby or any of your baby's toys or other items. If washing regularly with soap and water is challenging for you, another more convenient option is to use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer - you can carry this with you in your purse during outings and throughout the day.


Also wash your hands before working in the kitchen and preparing your baby's food.
 This means that if your baby (or anyone else) is within 6 feet of you when you cough or sneeze, he or she is at high risk of picking up the infection. This is why it is so important to cover all coughs and sneezes with a tissue.


Using a tissue is preferable to using your hand, as this way your hands do not get contaminated with the infectious droplets.
The flu virus can also be transmitted from touching contaminated objects; however, respiratory droplets are the most common mode of transmission.
 This helps to prevent the transmission of germs not only to your baby (if you are touching any of the same toys or objects), but also to anyone else who may be living in the home (as the less people in the home who become sick the better).


For this reason, be sure to clean doorknobs, countertops, and kitchen appliances, and to change the linens and bathroom towels that you have been using.

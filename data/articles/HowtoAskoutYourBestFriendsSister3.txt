 If you go to the same church, for instance, you may have an opportunity to ask her out after the service. If you go to the same mall to work, you might run into her in the cafeteria. So, you need to think about possible opportunities to ask her out.
 You need to be very specific when asking her out, so that she has something to respond to. For instance, you could ask her if she would like to go for coffee after class or if she is free to check out a movie on the weekend.You might say, “I remember you saying you love dark roast coffee. I found an amazing coffee place on third street downtown that has this incredible Italian roast. I think you would appreciated it. Do you want to check it out on the weekend?”
For instance, you might say, "A few friends and I are going rock climbing at Echo point on the weekend. We are thinking of making the day of it, maybe bringing a lunch and trying to get in three or four climbs. Do you want to join us?"

, If you feel slightly awkward about asking her out directly, you could use an indirect method.You could ask, “what are you up to this weekend?” She might reply, “I have a soccer game on Saturday afternoon, and then a study group. I’m not sure yet what I’m doing afterwards.” If she says something like this, you could then say, “That sounds fun. I was considering a movie on Saturday night. Maybe you would like to join me after your study session?”
For instance, you could also find an opportunity to help her with one of her projects. You might ask, "How are you feeling about your upcoming theatre production at Studio Y?" If she says she is worried about her lines, you might say something reassuring like, "You work so hard on them, I know you'll be great! But if you want to practice them some more, I would be happy to help out. Maybe we could grab a coffee and I could listen and give line prompts?"

, If you have the opportunity to go on the date, it is best to be forthright in expressing how much you enjoy spending time with her.

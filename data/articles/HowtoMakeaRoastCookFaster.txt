 This cooking process works by using a fan to continuously blow hot air onto the meat rather than just surround it, and as a result you can roast dishes and sides approximately 25% faster than with a regular oven. If time is a factor for you, you may wish to consider purchasing and using a convection oven.;
, Pressure cookers steam the roast by using a great deal of pressure and force the heat into the meat. This option will roast food in approximately 1/3 of the time compared to traditional cooking methods. The initial investment in a good pressure cooker is generally modest and has the added benefit of being "green," which can save you roughly 70% of the energy that an oven uses.
 You can use a pan you already own rather than having to purchase new appliances or tools. By searing the roast for approximately 5 minutes per side, you will flash heat the meat in a much faster way and produce a crispy crust on the outside of the roast, which many diners enjoy.
 When placed in a dark gray or black pan, meat will cook and brown slightly quicker in the oven. A dark metal roasting pan will shave anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes off the total oven cooking time.
 Larger chunks take longer to cook, which will extend your cooking time. Use a kitchen knife to cut bite-size pieces.
 Use a sharp knife to cut out any bones from the meat, and you can reduce cooking time. Although removing bones can add approximately 20 minutes to your overall cooking time, it can be done in advance of cooking and saves you significant time in roasting by reducing the overall size of the bird.

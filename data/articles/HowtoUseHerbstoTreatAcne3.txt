 Part of stopping another outbreak of acne involves keeping your skin fresh and clean. While soap and water may work, they can dry the skin out or may add oil to your skin, resulting in more skin problems. Some people recommend using a grain mixture to gently wash away dirt and dead skin, keeping your skin clean and healthy. Apply this recipe from a leading herbalist to your face in the evenings, gently rubbing it in, before washing it off:1 cup of ground oatmeal
2 cups of white clay
1/4 cup of ground almonds
1/4 cup of ground lavender
1/4 cup of ground roses
Optional oils such as peppermint or orange
Mix these together with water to create a paste you can apply.
 Although your skin breathes and functions through its pores, open pores can also become clogged. Tightening your pores using an astringent may help to prevent them from becoming clogged and reduce the chances of an acne outbreak. To create an astringent, you will need to:Take 1 1/2 cups fresh lemon balm, 1 cup fresh chamomile flowers, 1 cup fresh rose petals, 3/4 cups calendula, 3/4 cup comfrey, 1/4 cup fresh rosemary, and a tablespoon of lemon peel. Place them in a large jar.
Cover the herbs with witch hazel extract. Allow the herbs to sit for two weeks, then strain the liquid and discard the herbs.
Add 1/2 cup rosewater.
Apply the astringent nightly using a cotton ball.
 Your skin may become dried out after applying certain herbal treatments. On the other hand, your skin may be made more oily by them. By regularly applying a non-oily moisturizer daily, you can help maintain a balance and prevent acne outbreaks. Try this recipe to get you started:Boil rose hips and a few drops of rose water together.
Strain this mixture.
Add two tablespoons of aloe juice.
Keep this refrigerated and apply daily for the best effect.

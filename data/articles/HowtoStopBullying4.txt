 Since bullying is so common, every school has a policy for handling it efficiently and effectively. Talk to your school principal or school counselor about the situation so that it stops as soon as possible. Steps will be taken to either punish the bully or set up a mediation to resolve the issue.


Know that other kids in your school are experiencing the same problem, and rules and protocols are in place for good reason.
If you're a parent, set up a meeting with the school administrator instead of trying to handle the situation on your own.
 This form of bullying has become so common that phone services and other service providers also have plans in place for dealing with abuse. Call your service providers to report the bullying so that action will be taken to block the person from continuing to contact you. You may have to provide phone or email records to the service provider.
 Certain forms of bullying can be quite dangerous, and some are even classified as crimes. If the bullying you experience involves one of these elements, call your local police department.


Physical violence. Bullying can lead to real physical harm. If you're worried that your health or life is in danger, call the police.
Stalking and use of intimidation. If someone is violating your personal space and intimidating you, that's a crime.
Death threats or threats of violence.
Dispersion of potentially humiliating photos or videos without your consent, including sexually explicit photos or videos.
Hate-related actions or threats.
 Continued bullying that causes emotional or physical damage may be grounds for taking legal action. If the measures taken by the school and the bully's parents are not sufficient to correct the problem, you might want to consider getting a lawyer involved.

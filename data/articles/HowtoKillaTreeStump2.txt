 This method is free, but can take a long time. The idea is to slowly kill the stump by denying its basic needs. Put a dark tarp or trash bag over the stump so it wonâ€™t receive sun or water.
 During this time, the stump will slowly die. Check it from time to time to see how things are progressing. It should begin to rot and fall apart.


As it dies and rots, you can use stump removal solution to speed the process along. It's available at nurseries and garden centers.
You can also add some Epsom salt to cracks that appear in the stump, or see Method One and drill holes in the stump and fill them with salt to make it go faster.
 Covering the stump should prevent anything from growing, but until the stump is dead, you can cut saplings off the base of the trunk as they sprout, or paint them with a woody brush killer that contains triclopyr. If your goal is to allow one tree to grow from the old stump, cut off additional saplings do not apply an herbicide.

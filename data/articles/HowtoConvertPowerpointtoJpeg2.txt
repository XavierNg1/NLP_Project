 Use this method if you do not have Powerpoint available or if your version of Powerpoint does not allow you to convert your presentation to JPEG images. Search for "convert ppt to jpg" in a search engine of your choice. There are dozens of web-based tools that are online that do not require a download.
 Try using an online web-based tool such as docx2doc.com.Other tools may act slightly differently, but will use a similar method of converting your presentation. Use your own discretion when using links from untrustworthy sources as other sites might perform malicious actions on your computer.
 Click on "choose file." This opens a file browser that requires a Powerpoint ppt file as a source.
 Select your ppt file either by double clicking on the file, or by clicking on the file then click on "Open" to open the file.
 Click "Convert File to JPG." Click on the "Open" link that appears afterward to download the converted slides to your computer. This link will remain active for one hour. Afterwards you will have to start the entire process over to convert your presentation.

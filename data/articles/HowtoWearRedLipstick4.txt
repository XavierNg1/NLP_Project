 Red lipstick is a statement piece, almost an accessory. As such a bold statement, it is important to keep the rest of your makeup toned down. Heavy eye makeup with red lipstick will leave you looking childish or costume-like. Rather, keep a neutral eye with soft skin for the most classic look.
 Unless youâ€™re using a top-of-the-line lipstick, it is likely that your lipstick will fade or feather over time. Avoid wearing bad lipstick for extended periods of time by checking it often. Wipe off any that has bled outside your lips, and even out your lips by wiping off areas that are particularly heavy.
 Following the aforementioned tip, it is necessary to reapply red lipstick every few hours. When you noticed that it has faded significantly, swipe on a second (or third) coat. Keeping your lipstick fresh will keep your look sophisticated and classy rather than sloppy.

 Use a paintbrush to apply denatured alcohol to the surface of the wood. The finish is shellac if it turns to liquid after applying the alcohol. If the finish becomes malleable but does not liquefy, it is composed of lacquer and shellac.;
, Apply lacquer thinner to the surface of the wood if nothing happens after applying denatured alcohol. The finish is lacquer if it turns to liquid.
 If nothing happens with either of these thinning substances, your wood is probably covered in varnish or paint.

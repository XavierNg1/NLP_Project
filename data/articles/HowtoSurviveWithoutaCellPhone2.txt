 This can be helpful if you are familiar with the weight or feel of the cell phone in your purse or pocket, or if you used your cell phone for purposes such as taking notes.


Carry a portable music player, notepad, book, or similar object to take the place of your cell phone.
 With a cell phone, you may have had the ability to make plans on the road, or call your friends to arrange a meeting place after arriving at your destination. Without a cell phone, you will need to make more specific plans in advance.


Determine the exact times and meeting places for appointments, get-togethers, and meetings when you have plans to meet friends, family members, or business colleagues.
 This can prevent your acquaintances from becoming frustrated, angry, or perplexed when they are unable to reach you, and can also prevent your loved ones from worrying about your well-being.


Provide your acquaintances with information regarding the best methods for reaching you, whether it be at your email address, or during specific times at a landline telephone. Some landline service providers allow text messages to delivered in voice format to their landlines, your friends can use that if you are unreachable.
 For example, if your daily ritual was playing games on your phone or texting during your lunch hour, then read a book or magazine, or listen to music instead.
 This practice can be an ideal way to mentally cope without a cell phone in a positive manner. For example, apply the time you normally spent on a cell phone to going to the gym, educating yourself, or spending more time with your family.

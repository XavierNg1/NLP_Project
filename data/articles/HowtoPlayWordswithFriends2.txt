 The following screen will pop up:;
, You can either play with a Facebook friend, a random user, another WWF user, someone from your contacts list, or with the person physically next to you.


In the last option, you will physically pass your smartphone to the other player after each turn, so the game is only accessible from your phone.
With the other options, your opponents can be remote and are accessing the game from their own devices.
Wait for your gameboard to populate.
 The numbers in the corner of each letter indicate how many points using that letter is worth. Your score for the turn is the sum of all the point values of the letters you used. The less common your letter is (or the harder it is to make a word with), the more points it will be worth.
 They will have to connect their word with yours in a horizontal or vertical fashion, as though they were building a crossword puzzle.
 Place another word onto the existing words on the board, and try to score as many points as you can!

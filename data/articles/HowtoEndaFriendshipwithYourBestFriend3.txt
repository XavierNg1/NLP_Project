, Perhaps their flaws grate on you, but you still care about their feelings. You can spare their self-esteem by saying that the two of you aren't a good match, or even that you can't meet their needs as a friend.


"I can't be the friend you want me to be." (for a clingy friend who drains your energy)

"Our friendship feels like a lot of work, and I don't have energy from it anymore."
"I need to quit drinking, because it's hurting my life. I need to be away from the bar, and away from temptation."

, Assert your own dignity and let them know what hurt you. Don't call names or speak aggressively; you don't want to be a bully yourself.


"I've asked you multiple times not to make fun of my accent. It's a sensitive spot for me and I don't appreciate being teased about it. I don't want to be friends with someone who is constantly disregarding my feelings."
"It was not okay for you to make fun of my sister for having Down Syndrome. She is very important to me, and I will not be friends with someone who makes fun of people with disabilities."

, Your friend might get defensive or angry. This is difficult to deal with, and it is also normal.
 Now is a good time to reach out and make new friends, focus on existing relationships, or work on a hobby or project you enjoy. Ending a friendship is difficult, so take good care of yourself.

 While some of the most common certification processes have been discussed in this article, there are certainly other certification opportunities you can take advantage of. Try conducting an internet search for "green business certifications" and see what types of opportunities are out there. For example, the SBA has a website dedicated to green business certification opportunities. That website offers at least 15 ways you can certify your green business., Green businesses are not only certified by private companies and organizations. A lot of times, green businesses can get certified through state and local governments as well. For example, in Maine, you can apply for green business certification through the state Department of Environmental Protection., Other businesses can also be a great resource for certification opportunities. If you see a product with some sort of green certification label, or if you hear of a green business in a news article, reach out to that business. Let that business know that you are interested in green certification and ask if you can speak with someone about their journey.

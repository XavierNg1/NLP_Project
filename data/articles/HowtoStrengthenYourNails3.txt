 If your nails seem to be weak and brittle no matter what you do, it's time to think more about what you're putting in your body. Your nails, like the rest of your body, are nourished and strengthened by the food you eat. Nails are actually made out of protein, so if you aren't getting enough on a daily basis, it really shows in your nails.


Eat protein as part of every meal. Eggs, meat and fish are good choices, as are beans, other legumes and tofu.
You can also drink protein shakes or add protein powder to a glass of water or milk to get an extra boost of protein.
 Nails are also nourished by a lot of different vitamins that make them strong, healthy and shiny. If your nails look dull and yellowed, it's important to step up the amount of nutrients you're feeding them. Vitamins D, H and A are especially important for nail health.Dairy products are a great source of vitamin D.
Bananas, beans and eggs are great sources of vitamin H.Carrots and sweet potatoes will load you up with vitamin A.
 If you're on an extreme diet, it might make your nails stop growing. Not getting enough food can cause your nails to become brittle, yellowed and prone to breakage. Make sure you're getting enough calories - that includes calories through fats, proteins and carbohydrates. A balanced diet and healthy lifestyle are essential for healthy nails.

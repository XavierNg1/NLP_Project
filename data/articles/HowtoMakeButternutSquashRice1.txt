 Place the butter in a medium saucepan. Put the saucepan on your stovetop. Turn the burner to medium heat and thoroughly melt the butter., Once the butter is melted, turn the heat to high. Then add the cumin seeds and the mustard seeds. Cook over high heat until the mustard seeds begin to pop. This will take about 30 seconds., Once the mustard seeds begin popping, add the diced butternut squash. Then add the basmati rice. Stir to coat with the butter., After the squash and rice are coated with butter, add the water and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil., Once the mixture begins to boil, reduce the heat to low. Cover the saucepan with a tight fitting lid., Cook the butternut squash basmati rice on low for about 15 minutes, or until the water is completely absorbed and the squash is tender. Remove from the heat., After you remove the butternut squash basmati rice from the stovetop, you will need to let it stand for about 5 minutes. After you let it stand, use a fork to fluff the rice. Serve immediately.

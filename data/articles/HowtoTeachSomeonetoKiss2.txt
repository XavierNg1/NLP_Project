 Start by giving your significant other teasing kissing techniques to teach how to give a sweet kiss. Give a tender surface kiss with your lips pressed against your partner’s lips. Include gentle nibbles on your significant other’s bottom lip, but don’t give them a full kiss yet.If your girlfriend starts to kiss you and gets overzealous, pull back and give gentle kisses on your girlfriend’s neck or ear to reset. Then, work your way back to gently kissing her lips.
Give your boyfriend a few gentle peck kisses on the lips before slightly opening your lips.
 When your boyfriend begins to kiss you too hard or sloppily, pull yourself away from him and communicate how you’d like to be kissed. Nicely tell him that you want to be kissed gently. Show him how to kiss you by saying, “I want to be kissed like this” and then giving him the type of kiss you’re looking for., If your girlfriend is applying a bit too much pressure when she kisses you, you can give her a gentle hint to lay off the pressure. Run your hair through her hair while gently pulling her head back a bit to relieve the pressure on you. When her lips are lighter on yours, say something to let her know this is what you like.


Say “Mmm, this is how I love to kiss you”

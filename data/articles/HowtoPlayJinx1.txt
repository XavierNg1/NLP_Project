 Jinx happens when two people say the same word or phrase at the same time. For instance, if you and a friend say "Woah" or "That's awesome!" at the same time, it would be considered a jinx., Once a word is said at the same time, the first person to say "jinx" starts the game., If you say "jinx," the other person is not allowed to talk for the rest of the game. If the other person says "jinx" first, you are not allowed to talk for the rest of the game., The game ends when the person who originally said "jinx" says the other person's name or when the jinxed person speaks, losing the game., If the person who is jinxed speaks during the game, that person owes the person who did the jinxing a drink, usually a Coke.

 Next to this sketch in a smaller, teardrop-like shape to serve as the base of the grip., This should be coming straight off the front of the saddle, so don't hesitate to draw it boldly., This will serve as the seat itself. Also add a portion to the top of the grip., Add stretched drop shapes for the stirrups., These should connect the sides of the stirrup so a foot could rest in it comfortably., Alternately you can use bright colors and decorations, if you're putting the saddle on a flamboyant show horse--the overall look is up to you!

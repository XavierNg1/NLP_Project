 It is the one that looks like a triangle. It has two diagonal bars, and a horizontal bar at the bottom. This method is great for dress pants.
 Your thumbs should be touching the inseams. Your fingers should be touching the outer leg seams. The inseams should be facing each other.
 It might be easier to place the hanger on a rod first. The horizontal bar should be between the two pant legs. You should still be holding the pants by the cuffs.
 Pull the leg through the hanger, and fold it across the bar.
 Let go of the cuff., Pull the other leg through the hanger and drape it across the horizontal bar. Tug the leg down until the pants hangs evenly.
 The pants now won't slip off the hanger, no matter how much you shake it.

 Use a green sheet of fabric and cut it large enough for the horse to "feed" on.



Cut one egg carton hole off the egg carton.
Poke holes each side of the open end of the egg carton hole.
Feed thin gauge wire through each hole to form a semi-circle handle. Wind into place each end.
Done.
 Use half of a toilet paper roll. Simply cut in half, then color the inside blue. Gently rest in the pasture or inside the barn.
 Use old lids or tops off food items to make into food containers.
 Use netting from the craft material basket. Glue to popsicle sticks and fill with dried grass from outside. Hang onto the barn.

 Before your guest arrives, make sure that you’ve created a set of house rules.


Most of the time, guests don’t intend to be rude or misbehave. They simply don’t know the rules, limitations, and culture that exists in the place they’re staying.
Make sure that you let your guest know the guidelines that are in place in your house. This will make it easier for them to comply and will go a long way toward avoiding any future misunderstandings.;
, After you’ve set the house rules, it is important that you follow through and enforce them. If you have any areas that you’ve declared to be off limits, make sure that they remain off limits.


Don’t be afraid to enforce your rules when guests are becoming too invasive.
 It is best to secret these offsite at a friend's or relative's place. You’ll never know if a guest has some unwanted habits until they show it, so make sure that you’re ready if and when the situation arises. Remember that you’re still sharing your home with a complete stranger and some guests may find it rather tempting to bring back “souvenirs.”

, If your guest is showing some behavior or conduct that makes you uncomfortable, speak up. Staying silent won’t help the situation, so make sure to talk to them in an honest and straight forward way about the those things which bother you.


Their actions probably seem normal to them, so they won’t know that there is a disconnect unless you tell them. Misunderstandings can be avoided by having simple talks early in the relationship.
 If you’ve tried every reasonable way to ease the situation, maybe it’s time to ask them to leave.


Some Couchsurfers have the impression that they can do whatever they want simply because they’re the guests. This is completely untrue. Both hosts and guests have responsibilities to behave civilly and respectfully when sharing a house.
Don’t be afraid to kick them out. After all, it’s still your house.

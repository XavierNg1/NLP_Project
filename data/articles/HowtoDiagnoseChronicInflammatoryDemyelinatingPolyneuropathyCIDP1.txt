 CIDP is closely related to Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS), and many of the symptoms are similar. The first signs that a person may have CIDP include "motor deficiencies," like physical weakness and pain. These symptoms usually progress slowly over a period of two months. It is important to note that these symptoms could indicate a wide-variety of treatable conditions, and do not alone indicate CIDP.Some of these physical symptoms may include:


Weakness
Numbness
Difficulty walking (especially on stairs)
Tingling
Pain
Fainting spells (while standing up)
Burning in the extremities
Sudden onset of back and/or neck pain that radiates through the limbs;
, Other signs of CIDP fall under the category of “autonomic dysfunction.” These "sensory" symptoms may appear after the onset of primary physical symptoms. They may also progress over a period of weeks.Once again, these symptoms could indicate any number of treatable conditions, and do not alone point to CIDP. Symptoms include:


Dizziness
Difficulty breathing
Bowel and bladder problems
Nausea
Eye twitching (ranging from mild to severe)
Twitching or shaking in other parts of the body

, Symptoms of CIDP usually progress over an 8-week period, gaining intensity.This slow (either steady or step-wise) development of symptoms over an 8-week period is one of the best ways to distinguish this disorder from the more common Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS).As such, it is very important to have a record of when symptoms began, and how they have progressed.


Start a health journal.
Write down a quick note about how you feel each day.
Include dates for when symptoms began.
Include a note about the severity of symptoms.
 CIDP has been detected in people of all ages (including children). However, people between the ages of 50 and 60 are far more likely to be diagnosed. Take your age into consideration when attempting to diagnose CIDP.

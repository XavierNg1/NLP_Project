 Mix well with a spoon or stirring rod to blend the flavors.


Note that stevia is a natural sweetener that grows as a plant. Cola stevia is a liquid stevia extract flavored with a generic cola taste.
 Pour 8 oz (250 ml) of cold, carbonated soda water into the glass. The carbonation should begin to combine the flavoring ingredients.


Carbonation alone may not be enough to combine the ingredients evenly, though. To ensure more even flavor distribution, use a stirring rod, spoon, or straw to gently and slowly mix the drink a few times. Work carefully so that you do not cause too many bubbles to form and do not cause the drink to go flat.
Use cold cola water to reduce the likelihood of needing to chill the drink before enjoying it.
 Ideally, the drink should already be cold enough to enjoy. If you want it to be colder, however, refrigerate it for 15 minutes or so before drinking.

 Use the division tool (Path->Division). This tool divides one shape in two, using another shape. Trace the shape of one of the borders. Then you will have two objects. They will be in order, so that the uppermost shapes cover the lower ones (if they are not transparent). It is important that the object that will divide the island be above the island. To ensure that this is so, use Object->Raise (PgUp). Select both objects. Click on one and then the other while holding down the shift key. Create a division: Path->Division. You should now have two objects.

This is the basic process for dividing maps into regions. Continue with the same process to divide the map as many times as necessary to get a mosaic of regions.
Although it almost always possible to make maps simply by dividing, it wouldn't be a bad idea to take a look at the other other options in the Path menu (union, intersection, divide path, etc.), because they are very useful.

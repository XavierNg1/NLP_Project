 Steamers work wonderfully for most fabrics, as steaming is a delicate method of de-wrinkling. Fabrics that can be steamed include most cottons, silks, wools, and polyesters. However, some fabrics should not be steamed. These fabrics include waxed jackets, suede, or materials that may melt, such as plastic.


If youâ€™re unsure if your fabric can be steamed, carefully test the steamer on a small corner of the fabric before using it on the entire garment.
Always check fabric care labels for advice prior to steaming.;
, Fabrics made from silk, chiffon, sheer, or velvet should be treated with care. Keep a few inches of distance between the steamer and the fabric, and don't steam in one place of fabric for too long. To avoid damaging embellishments or prints, steam the garment inside out to get rid of the wrinkles., Irons and steamers are both meant to take the wrinkles out of clothing, though they each have their own perks. Irons are typically best on less delicate fabrics (like cotton or denim), and are ideal for pressing creases into clothing. Steamers work on a larger variety of fabrics, as they are less likely to damage fabrics.

Steamers are more portable than irons, so they are ideal for those who travel a lot., Pour cold water into the water tank of your clothing steamer. Make sure that all of the parts of the steamer are secured properly, you don't want to leak water all over the place.

It may be helpful when you are steaming extremely dense or wrinkly fabrics. If you decide to use a pad, slip it over one hand and use your other hand to hold the steamer.
With extremely wrinkly clothing, you should steam from the inside of the garment, or underneath the garment. The weight of the fabric against the steam will help to get the wrinkles out more quickly.When steaming fabrics with embellishments such as pleats, ruffles, etc., hold the steamer at a distance of 1-2 inches from the fabric. This will allow the fabric to keep its shape while the steam de-wrinkles it. If the garment is extremely wrinkled, you can also turn the garment inside out to steam the fabric without damaging the embellishments.
 After a fresh steaming, your garment will feel damp. There may also be some small water spots. Do not be alarmed, this is completely normal and your garment will dry. Let the garment sit for 5-10 minutes after steaming it before you put it on or hang it in your closet. This will give the garment ample time to dry.

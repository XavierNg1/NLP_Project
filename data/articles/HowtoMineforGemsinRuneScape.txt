, There is a fine though, so bring about a 100 GP. (The fine is not necessarily 100 gold pieces, just bring a few extra.)

, You need a certain Mining level to mine these rocks, so check in your Mining pull-up directory to see if you have the required level. Don't forget to bring a pickaxe! (Preferably the best you can use.)

, There are few rocks, so make sure to go on a server with very few people, because there are about 5 rocks, and if someone else is there, you'll have trouble! Sometimes you get rubies and emeralds, but mostly you get jades and opals, which break easily when used with a chisel. They are not very profitable in the Grand Exchange though, so try to drop these or bank them for future use in quests, and try to get the more valuable gems.
 (Note that tin and copper rocks probably VERY RARELY if never give gems.)


There is no real way to get only a gem and not the ore you're mining unless you get a gem and click another rock or click elsewhere before you get the ore.
 What is recommended to get gems more commonly while mining is to wear a (CHARGED!) Amulet of Glory. 3 to 4 charges works best, 2 to 1 charge(s) works, but not as well. The Amulet of Glory increases the chance of getting a gem while mining, like a rabbit foot increases the chance of getting a bird's nest while woodcutting.

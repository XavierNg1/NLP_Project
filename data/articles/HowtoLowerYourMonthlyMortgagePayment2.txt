 A 30-year mortgage can help you save more money over time, lower your monthly payments, and can provide you with tax incentives in the U.S. A 15-year payment plan can help you pay off your mortgage faster, but you will have larger monthly payments.

 Reduce the amount of money you need to borrow by paying a large down payment on your home. If you are in the position to pay more money upfront, you will have a lower mortgage principal that you will have to pay interest on. Additionally, placing a down payment that is 20% or greater will eliminate your PMI payments. This can help shorten the lifespan of your mortgage and slash your interest payments.

 Use a strainer with small to medium-sized gaps. Fine gaps will allow you to separate as much of the solid from the liquid as possible, but they may make the process go slower. Medium gaps offer a nice balance between speed and quality.
 The bowl should have a wide enough opening to catch any liquid that falls from the strainer. If possible, select a bowl that the strainer can rest on in order to free up both hands.
 You should see juice running through the strainer and into the bowl. Keep pressing until you are unable to produce any more juice.
 Garlic pulp can be used to flavor stews, soups, stir-frys, and a number of other recipes.
 The filter should be secured with a rubber band so that it rests loosely over the bowl, but will not fall inside. Running the juice through a coffee filter will create an even purer product. You can also use your coffee maker, but be aware of the fact that garlic has a potent odor that may linger even after you clean your machine. As a result, any coffee you prepare in the machine afterward may have a hint of garlic flavor.
 If you pour too quickly, you may spill some. Continue pouring until all of the juice is strained into the bowl.
 Keep it in a glass bowl to prevent the odor from contaminating other foods, as well as to prevent any other flavors from contaminating the garlic juice.

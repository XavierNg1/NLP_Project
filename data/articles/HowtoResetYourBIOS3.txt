 You will need to be able to access the motherboard of your computer. be very careful when working on the inside of your computer, as electrostatic discharge can easily destroy sensitive components. Make sure that you are properly grounded before working inside the computer.


For many laptops, you can access the CMOS battery from a removable panel on the bottom of the laptop. If there is no panel available, you will most likely need to disassemble the laptop to access it.
 The battery is typically located near your PCI slots, but may be in different locations depending on the manufacturer of your motherboard. It may be hidden by expansion cards and cables. The battery is usually a standard 3V, round, flat watch battery (CR2032).
 Press and hold the power button on your computer for about 10-15 seconds (nothing should happen because the power is turned off). This will discharge any remaining power stored in the capacitors. By discharging the power, the CMOS memory will reset, thereby resetting your BIOS.
 Carefully reinsert the CMOS battery back into its housing. Make sure that you have put the battery in the right direction. The slightly smaller side should be facing down.


Close your case back up after reinserting the battery.
 Move the rocker-style switch at the back of your PC to the ON (I) position. If you unplugged the computer from the wall, plug it back in.
 Press the front Power button. You will need to enter your BIOS and reconfigure all of the settings, including the time, date, and boot order.

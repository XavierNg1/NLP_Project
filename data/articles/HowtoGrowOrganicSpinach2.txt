 Place your spinach seeds between wet paper towels, put the towels in a sealable plastic bag and store them in the refrigerator for 7 days before you are ready to plant them.
 Tamp the soil lightly, forming rows that have a depression of 1/2" (1.3 cm). The rows should be about 10” (25 cm) apart.
 Planting the seeds too close together will make it harder to thin them later on.
 Sprinkle soil over the seeds and lightly tamp the soil with a hoe or with the palm of your hand. Use just enough soil to cover the seeds.
 You should water immediately after planting. It’s best to water your spinach seeds with a sprinkling can so that you don’t dislodge the seeds. Once the plants have rooted, you can switch to a garden hose.
 Plant several new rows of spinach every 7 to 10 days during the spring if you want to enjoy fresh spinach all season long. You can even plant spinach seeds in the late fall for an early spring crop. Freezing weather won’t harm the seeds.
 To ensure healthy, strong plants, thin seedlings to 6” (15 cm) apart once 2 true leaves have formed. (True leaves are fully formed.)

, Spinach is a cool weather crop and will bolt (go to seed) if the weather is too hot and it gets too much sun. Provide a shade cloth or plant the spinach in the shade of taller vegetables, such as pole beans.

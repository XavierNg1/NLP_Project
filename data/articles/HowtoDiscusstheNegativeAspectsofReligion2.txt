 The majority of theists will assume that an attack on religion is an attack on their god or gods. Make it clear that you wish to discuss aspects of organized religion only and are not questioning their belief in a personal god.
 Religion is a touchy subject for a lot of people and is generally not considered "polite conversation." Always ensure that everyone present is open to discussing religion.
, There are plenty of positive points in favour of religion that are perfectly valid.
 No simple discussion is going to pull anyone away from their religion, the purpose of the discussion to broaden everyone's horizons, including your own.
 Although debate can be positive if the conversation degenerates into an argument be prepared to walk away.

 This works only with medication that can be crushed. Many times it is possible to crush medicine up for your dog. However, some medicine should not be crushed because the contents may taste extremely bitter and cause the dog to leave the food or because the tablet is designed to be slow-released over 24 hours and crushing destroys this ability.


Liquid medicine inside capsules can be removed by lancing the capsule and squeezing the medicine out.
Don't crush pills that have a coating.
Check the container or ask your vet to see if you can crush the pill.
 Rice and beef make a good combination that is easy to digest. It is not recommended that you try this with dry dog food, as moisture will likely be required in order to hold the medicine and the food together.
 Make sure that you don't give your dog too much, as unfinished medicated food means that your dog did not get his full dose of medicine.If you have other dogs, be sure that they do not eat the medicated food instead. Let the dog eat in a separate room if necessary.
 Take the pulverized pill and pour the powder into the syringe with water. Inject the water into the dog's mouth. He won't like it, but he'll get most of it.Open your dog's mouth. It doesn't have to be very wide, just enough to insert the syringe.
Insert the syringe near the back of the dog's mouth, so that you can squirt the medicine into the back of the dog's throat.
Push the plunger on the syringe, and squirt the medicine out. By giving your dog medicine this way, you make it nearly impossible for your dog to spit it out.
Give your pup a treat.

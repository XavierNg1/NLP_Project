 Paraphrasing is the process of using your own words to restate what someone else has written. Referring only to the indirect quote, use different words to convey the quote’s meaning. Include the indirect quote’s author in this paraphrased section.


For example, write: Roberts claims that new studies have been able to substantiate previous research.
 Since you are using your own words, you don’t need any quotation marks.
 Even though you have paraphrased, you still must add a citation to indicate where you got this quote from. After the paraphrased section that you have used, include a reference to the secondary source where you found the quote. Use “as cited in,” since you are referring to the citation from the secondary source.For example: Roberts claims that new studies have been able to substantiate previous research (as cited in Hoffman, 2010, p. 103).
 A works cited list is a list that appears at the end of your paper. This list will contain every source for which you’ve included parenthetical citations in the body of your paper. In the case of using an indirect quote, only list the secondary source on your works cited list.


For APA style, write: Hoffman, S. (2010). Book title. City of publication: Publisher.
For MLA style, write: Hoffman, Samuel. Book Title. City of publication: Publisher, 2010.

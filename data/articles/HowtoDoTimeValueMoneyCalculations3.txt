 These calculations make it clear that time is literally money. The value of the money you have now is higher than the same amount of money in the future. This is why you should know how to calculate the time value of money. It allows you to determine which investments are better, based upon not just how much money they return to you, but when they return it. , Present value can be used to determine whether a present payment of a certain value will end up being worth more or less than a future payment of a different value. For example, imagine that you have won the lottery and are offered either $1 million now or $2.5 million in ten years. Your money manager advises you that you can safely earn ten percent interest per year if you invest the money. Which payment should you take?

The present value of the $1 million is, obviously, $1 million. This is only two-fifths of the monetary value of the later payment, though.

However, the $2.5 million dollar payment is being made in ten years, during which time your $1 million could be earning ten percent interest (assuming you didn't spend it). If you apply the present value equation, you find that the present value of the $2.5 million is only about $964,000. 

So, you would want to take the $1 million now and invest it. It will be worth almost $2.6 million in ten years. 


, Present value calculations can also be used to analyze the profitability of business projects by using the concept "net present value." Net present value refers to the present value of projected sales revenues or interest earnings from a project or investment minus the present value of money invested in the investment or project. In this way, it is used to see whether or not the project will be profitable. Alternately, it can be used to determine susceptibility to interest rate fluctuations.

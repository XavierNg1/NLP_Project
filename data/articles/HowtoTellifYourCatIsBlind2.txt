 One of the changes you may see is a change of eye color. Additionally, look for more redness in your cat’s eyes. Alternatively, you might see that your cat’s eyes look milkier, cloudier, or appear more white.Look for excessive redness in the tissues around the eyes. Don’t worry if this is lighter pink, which is normal.
If the lenses of your cat’s eyes are opaque, this might be a sign of cataracts.
 If you suspect your cat is blind or going blind, look at its pupils. Note if the pupils stay the same in both bright and low light. Also check to see if the pupils are different sizes. Both of these are signs of blindness or incipient blindness.


Also note if your cat is squinting or if it’s indifferent to changes in lighting.
 Look for more tearing than usual in the corners of the eyes. Don’t worry about a little tearing, which is normal. Another sign to look out for is if your cat’s eyes are brighter and shinier than normal., Move a fingertip quickly towards your cat’s eye without making contact with the cornea. A sighted cat will flinch or blink when you move your fingertip towards them, but a blind cat will remain unaware of your finger. Don’t get too close to your cat’s whiskers or create a breeze on its whiskers so it can't sense your finger approaching its face., Notice if she watches or follows the descent of the ball. Most sighted cats will watch the ball drop. A blind cat will remain oblivious as the ball passes in front of it. Avoid getting too close to your cat's whiskers so it doesn't sense the ball.

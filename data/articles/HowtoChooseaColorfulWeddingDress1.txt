, A gold gown gives off a regal feel at a wedding. It is not too bright or gaudy, but is a nice subtle shade that adds something unique to your wedding gown. Many people find gold reminiscent of ancient goddesses, so gold can work great for a very archaic feel. You can go for a white gown with gold beads or a gown made from gold fabric.If you dislike the way gold looks on your skin tone, you can get a similar affect using another metal color. Try silver or copper instead if gold does not work for you.
 Nude colors are particularly subtle. They do not stray far from a traditional white.

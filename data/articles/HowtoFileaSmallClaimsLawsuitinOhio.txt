If you're suing a business, the court in the county where the business is located has jurisdiction.For this reason, it may be that you could file your claim in several different courts. When this is the case, you can choose whichever court is more convenient for you.If you're unsure about the territorial boundaries of a court's jurisdiction, particularly if there are two courts in relatively close proximity to each other, you should call the clerk's office and ask about that court's territory relative to the address you have for the location where the incident took place or where the person you want to sue lives.

If the defendant doesn't have any counterclaims, he or she typically is not required to file an answer, but may do so anytime within seven days of the hearing date., Many courts in Ohio have a mediator available to assist you in resolving your dispute amicably without going to trial.

Make sure everything you intend to enter as evidence is allowed by the court. Some types of evidence such as affidavits from witnesses are not allowed.

The magistrate will understand if you are nervous, but try to speak slowly and clearly.

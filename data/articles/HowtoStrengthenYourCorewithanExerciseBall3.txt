 You can also do some ball lifts to work your core muscles. To get started, place a yoga mat on the floor and lay down on your back. Position the ball in front of you so that it is easy to reach with your feet.
 Next, position the ball between your calves and squeeze it. Then, place your arms down at your sides and plant your hands on the yoga mat to brace yourself. When you feel ready, lift the ball with your calves. Bring it up as high as you can and then slowly lower it back down to the ground.Do 10 repetitions of this exercise.
Make sure that you are using your abs to lift the ball. You should feel your abs contract each time you lift and lower the ball.
 You can also work your obliques by lifting the ball. To do this, you will need to turn over onto your side, but keep the stability ball between your calves. Extend the arm closest to the floor above your head and rest your head on it. Then, place your other hand in front of you to steady yourself.
 When you are ready, contract your abs and raise the ball slightly.Donâ€™t worry if you can only lift the ball a couple of inches above the floor. Even this small movement will work your obliques.


Do as many repetitions as you like and then switch sides. Try to start with 10 reps and then work up to 20 as you get stronger.

Notice what people talk to you. Make an effort to return their attention, even if you’re not sure you’d like to be their friend. It might surprise you who you can connect with.
 Having a reason to hang out with new people can take the pressure off of you. Try to center these invites around common goals or interests.


For example, if you have a big test coming up in your English class, ask a few people who you like in your class to come over and study with you. This gives you a reason to ask for their phone number and something to talk about.
If you want to ask people to hang out outside of school, try making it about an event. For example, if your soccer team just won a game, as some people to go out for food afterwards with you to celebrate.
Offer to carpool. Driving people to a game or event can be a good way to get on more friendly terms with acquaintances.
 Remember, the worst that can happen is that someone doesn’t want to hang out.


Send people you’d like to hang out with messages through social media. Start with something simple like getting coffee at a cool coffee shop or going to a music show together.
Before you hang out with someone new, think about things you can talk about. This will help you avoid awkward silences.
Be clear about your intentions. You don’t want the person to misunderstand your invite and think you want to go on a date.

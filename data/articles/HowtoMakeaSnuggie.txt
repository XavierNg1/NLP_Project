 The benefit of fleece is that it does not need to be hemmed. If you do want to hem it, however, you'll need to use a stitch meant for stretchy fabrics, such as a narrow zigzag stitch.


If you must use a straight stitch, use a longer, basting length one.;
, Your piece should measure 60 by 108 inches (152.4 by 274.32 centimeters). A very tall person might need a longer piece of fabric.


If this snuggie is for a child, start with a piece of fabric that is 2 to 2.5 yards long. The width should stay the same: 60 inches (152.4 centimeters).
 The big rectangle should now measure 60 by 84 inches (152.4 by 213.36 centimeters). The strip should measure 24 by 60 inches (60.96 by 152.4 centimeters).


If this is for a child, cut a 20 inch (50.8 centimeters) strip off the bottom., Bring the narrow ends together, and cut along the fold. You will end up with two 24 by 30 inch (60.96 by 76.2 centimeters) strips. These will eventually become your sleeves.


If you have shorter arms, trim the rectangles down to 24 by 24 inch (60.96 by 60.96 centimeters) squares.If this is for a child, cut your strip down to 20 by 20 inch (50.8 by 50.8 centimeters) squares.
 Bring the wide ends together and flatten the fabric so that you end up with a long, skinny rectangle.
 Measure 13 inch (33.02 centimeters) down from the top, and 11 inches (27.94 centimeters) from the folded edge. Cut an oval that is 9 inches (22.86 centimeters) tall and 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) wide. Cut through both layers of fabric.


Consider setting the scraps aside to make pockets later.If this is for a child, measure 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) down from the top, and 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) from the fold. Make the oval 4¾ inches (12.07 centimeters) wide and 6 ½ inches (16.51 centimeters) tall.
These are standard measurements. To make your snuggie perfectly sized for you, measure across your shoulders, and divide that measurement in half. This is how far from the folded edge your ovals will be., Fold the little rectangles in half, lengthwise, and sew along the long edge using a 5/8 inch (1.59 centimeters) seam allowance. If this is for a child, you might need a larger seam allowance, bout 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Tie the ends of the threads into tight knots, and snip off the excess.


Choose a strong, polyester thread in a color that closely matches your fleece., At this point, you can hem the sleeves. Fold one of the ends on each sleeve inward by 1 to 3 inches (2.54 to 7.62 centimeters). Pin the hem down, and sew it with a zigzag stitch. Tie the ends of the threads into tight knots and snip off the tail ends.


These are standard measurements. If you want shorter sleeves, use a deeper hem. If you want longer sleeves, use a smaller hem.
 Make sure that the top/folded part of each sleeve is facing the top part of the big rectangle. The bottom seams should be facing the bottom part of the big rectangle.
 Tie the ends of the treads into tight knots, and snip off the excess.
 Fleece does not fray, so it does not need to be hemmed; however, not everyone likes the look of raw edges. You can hem your snuggie to give it a more professional finish. Simply fold the top, bottom, and side edges inward by ¾ inch (1.91 centimeters). Pin them in place, and sew them down using a zigzag stitch. Tie the ends of the thread off, and snip off the excess.


If this is for a child, consider using a deeper hem along the bottom. This way, you can lower the hem as the child grows.
 You can cut the ovals straight across, or at a slight angle. If you are making multiple snuggies, consider mixing and matching the pockets for added contrast.
 This will give your pockets a more finished look. It will also prevent the fleece from stretching out too much. Use a ¾ inch (1.91 centimeters) hem and a zigzag stitch. Remember to tie the ends of the threads off, and to snip away any excess.
 Put the snuggie on how you intend to wear it, and decide where the most comfortable pocket placement would be for you. Most pockets should be placed several inches/centimeters above the sleeve cuff, but some people might prefer their pockets lower.


Make sure that the hem is facing inward.
 You can use a straight stitch for this. Sew along only the curved edge, and not the top/straight edge. Sew as close to the raw edge as you can.

 Your hair can be freshly washed, but the curl will likely hold better if you washed it a day or two ago., You will divide out bigger sections of your hair for large curls and smaller sections for small curls., Divide your hair a section at a time. Lightly twist the section in your hand, Wrap each section loosely around two fingers. Once you have a small, loose bun, use two bobby pins to hold it in place. If you cross them over each other, they are less likely to come out., Work down from the top until all of your hair is pinned up. Go to sleep with it pinned up., When you wake up in the morning, remove the pins. You can use your fingers to loosen the curls but don't run a brush or comb through it., If your hair needs a little more body, let your head hang down in front of you. Loosen your curls by shaking your head back and forth.

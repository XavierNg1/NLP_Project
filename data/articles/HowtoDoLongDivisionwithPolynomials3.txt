 When you start a polynomial long division problem, you will not know at the beginning whether or not you will have a remainder. Set up the problem just as you would with any long division.For example, suppose you have the problem x2+5x+9x+3{\displaystyle {\frac {x^{2}+5x+9}{x+3}}}. Set this up as:


x+3)x2+5x+9¯{\displaystyle x+3{\overline {)x^{2}+5x+9}}}.
 Look at the first term of the dividend and the first term of the divisor. Estimate the quotient and write the result above the bar line.In this example, the first term of the quotient is x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} and the first term of the divisor is x{\displaystyle x}. x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} divided by x{\displaystyle x} goes in x{\displaystyle x} times, so write the result x{\displaystyle x} above the division bar line.
 Find the partial product for the first step by multiplying your first estimate of the quotient by the divisor. Write your result underneath the dividend.For this problem, multiply the x{\displaystyle x} that you wrote above the bar line by the terms of the divisor x+3{\displaystyle x+3}. Write the result, x2+3x{\displaystyle x^{2}+3x} underneath the corresponding terms x2+5x{\displaystyle x^{2}+5x}.
 Draw a line underneath your last result and subtract term by term. Write the differences at the bottom of the problem.In this example, the first terms will cancel as x2−x2=0{\displaystyle x^{2}-x^{2}=0}.

The second term subtraction is 5x−3x{\displaystyle 5x-3x}. Write the result, 2x{\displaystyle 2x}, at the bottom of the problem.
 As before, copy the next term of the dividend polynomial down to the bottom and add it to the result from your subtraction step.In this case, the final term of the polynomial is +9{\displaystyle +9}. Copy this down to the bottom and add it to the 2x{\displaystyle 2x} from your previous step. This creates the binomial 2x+9{\displaystyle 2x+9}.
 Look at the first terms and decide how many times the x{\displaystyle x} of your divisor x+3{\displaystyle x+3} will go into the 2x{\displaystyle 2x} at the bottom. Write this result, {\displaystyle } above the division line at the top of the problem. This gives you a quotient of x+2{\displaystyle x+2}., Use the term that you just placed in the quotient to multiply the divisor. Write the result at the bottom of the long division problem.In this example, multiply the +2{\displaystyle +2} by each term of the divisor x+3{\displaystyle x+3}. Write the result, 2x+6{\displaystyle 2x+6} at the bottom. Align the common terms underneath each other. 


, Draw a line under your last step and subtract common terms.In the sample problem, this should leave the subtraction of 2x+9{\displaystyle 2x+9} minus 2x+6{\displaystyle 2x+6}. The first terms, 2x−2x{\displaystyle 2x-2x} will cancel out. The final subtraction is 9−6{\displaystyle 9-6}. This leaves a remainder of 3. Because there are no more terms of the dividend polynomial to carry down, your work is done, except for reporting your result.
 Remember how you handle remainders when dividing with only numbers. Before you learned to divide into decimal points, you learned to write the remainder as a fraction over the divisor. You do the same thing with polynomial division. You will write the remainder as the numerator of a fraction, with the divisor as the denominator.Consider the numerical example, 3)35¯{\displaystyle 3{\overline {)35}}}. This would give a result of 11, with a remainder of 2. You would write your answer as 1123{\displaystyle 11{\frac {2}{3}}}.

For the polynomial division, your quotient was x+2{\displaystyle x+2} with a remainder of 3{\displaystyle 3}. Write the remainder as a fraction over the divisor, so you report your full quotient as x+2+3x+3{\displaystyle x+2+{\frac {3}{x+3}}}.

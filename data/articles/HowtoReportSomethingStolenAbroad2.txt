 Go to the nearest police station and report that your passport was stolen. Provide whatever information you have about the possible thief, and remember to get a copy of the police report before you leave.However, don’t report the stolen passport to the police if doing so will cause you to delay your travel home.
 If your passport is stolen, you’ll need to replace it before you return home.Find your home country’s nearest embassy or consulate. Look online.
 You need to present the consulate with sufficient documents to get a replacement passport. It’s okay if you don’t have everything. The consulate will look at what you have and try to help you. If you’re from the U.S., then try to gather the following:a passport photo (2x2 inches and taken within the past six months)
personal identification, such as your driver’s license
proof of U.S. citizenship, such as a birth certificate or photocopy of your missing passport
your travel itinerary
police report
a statement regarding the stolen passport, which you can complete at the consulate
an application for a passport, which you can complete at the consulate

, Ask how much a replacement passport costs. It might cost less if you are getting only a temporary, emergency passport. Talk with the consulate if all of your money has been stolen. If you need money, you can have someone at home wire you money using Western Union.
 For U.S. travelers, you may receive a replacement passport that is valid for ten years. However, you might be issued a limited-validity emergency passport if your travel plans are urgent. When you return home, you’ll turn in your emergency passport.You might also receive only an emergency passport if you need to borrow money from the consulate to fund your travel back home.

 When a person is exposed to a specific allergen, they can experience anaphylaxis. The reaction can be severe, and even life-threatening. Anaphylactic reactions usually occur within minutes of exposure, but can take as long as a half-hour or longer to occur in some cases. Look for the following symptoms of Anaphylaxis:Dizziness and/or fainting
Skin reactions like hives, itching, and flushed or pale skin
Low blood pressure
Swollen tongue or throat
Trouble breathing
Rapid or weak pulse
Vomiting
Diarrhea

, If a person already has an emergency pen on them and is experiencing symptoms of anaphylaxis, ask them if they need help using the allergy emergency pen. A person who knows they need an injection should be able to instruct you. If not, instructions are printed on the side of the emergency pen., Hold the emergency pen with your fist firmly on the middle of the device. Inject the emergency pen into the muscle or fat of the mid-outer thigh directly through the clothing, and then hold in place for a slow count of three seconds. Remove the device and then massage the injection site for 10 seconds.Do not administer the emergency pen in the buttock, veins, hands, or feet.
The effects of an emergency pen may wear off after 10-20 minutes. You may administer a second dose if symptoms are not subsiding, but do not administer more than two doses., Even if you administer the emergency pen and symptoms appear to be improving, it is critical that the person receives professional medical help as soon as possible. Call emergency services and immediately tell them your location. Then describe the situation and ask that medical help be sent immediately.

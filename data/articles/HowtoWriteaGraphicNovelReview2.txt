 Consider some of the things that attract you to the graphic novel you're holding in your hands: the title (both the actual words and the way they're rendered), the subject matter, the cover art (front and back), any blurbs, the author and artist, and so on. Any of these can serve as a jumping-off point for your review. Skim through the graphic novel to get a sense of the writing and art styles.
 Superhero graphic novels may either be original stories or collected from story arcs published over a series of issues of a regular title or miniseries, such as Frank Miller's "Batman: The Dark Knight Returns" being compiled from a 4-issue miniseries; each issue becomes a chapter title in the book. Graphic novels about real people, such as Reinhard Kleist's "I See a Darkness," about the life of Johnny Cash, is structured around key points of Cash's life and career: his early years, his 1968 concert at Folsom Prison at the height of his career, and concluding his final album for Rick Rubin just after wife June Carter's death.
 Make notes about the story, the writing, the art, and any literary or artistic devices you see used in telling the story.


For example, both "The Dark Knight Returns" and "I See a Darkness" make considerable use of shadow in their art. For "The Dark Knight Returns," which is rendered in color, the shadows show both the gritty reality of the graphic novels' version of Gotham City the story is set in and symbolize the twilight of Bruce Wayne's Batman career. In "I See a Darkness," the shadows tie into Johnny Cash's nickname of "The Man in Black" and symbolize the inner demons that plagued him in the early years of his career.

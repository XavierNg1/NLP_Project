 Most game retailers will sell them, however due to high demand you may have to be put onto a waiting list (which could be anything from days to months, depending on the popularity in your particular area and whether or not there are other game retailers in the vicinity). You could also scour the internet on sites like eBay for second hand consoles if you can't afford one brand new or you simply can't wait on that list any longer!;
, Follow the instructions in the manual on how to plug it into your TV and sync your Wii remote (If you have purchased more than one remote). Everything you need (eg Wii remote, Nunchuk, cables etc) will be included in the package.
 Your Wii sports game will be included in the box your console arrived in. Remember it is very important you use the wrist strap as there is a chance it could come flying out of your hand during game play and injure someone. It could also damage possessions like that very expensive TV you might have.
 Aim to do 30 minutes game play everyday on Wii sport. Make sure you use full body movement, e.g. when hitting the tennis ball, do it as if you were playing real tennis, moving around and using full swing.
 Boxing is really good and done right, you can burn ~125 calories per 15 minutes. Golf and bowling don't require you to move much and thus aren't very effective.
 Guzzle water instead.
 Even if you don't change your diet, it is still possible to lose weight

, It takes dedication, patience and motivation for anything to start happening.
 If you really can't be bothered, get up and try it anyway. If after 10 minutes you still feel lethargic, stop playing. However you may start to enjoy the movement and continue to play the full 30 minutes.

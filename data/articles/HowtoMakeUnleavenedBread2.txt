The day after the Passover became the First Day of Unleavened Bread, the beginning of seven Days of Unleavened Bread. The first and seventh days of this stretch were considered holy, and believers would congregate and give offerings to God.



This period of time was so sacred that the Israelis had to rid their homes and properties of any leaven during the time. Those who considered themselves people of God were required to eat unleavened bread every day of the seven-day stretch.

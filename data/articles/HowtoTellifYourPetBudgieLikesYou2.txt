 While human pupils dilate and constrict in response to light or darkness, a parakeet's pupils can change in size as a physical reaction to the bird's mood and environment. Flashing (the widening of the pupils) and pinning (the narrowing of the pupils) are controlled by the bird, and typically indicate excitement or pleasure, though these behaviors can also be an indication of fear or anxiety.If your parakeet's eyes flash and pin when he sees you, it is most likely an indication that he likes you and values your company., Hanging upside down is a common practice for birds. It is typically done when birds are happy and feel safe, as the position tends to leave the bird vulnerable. If your bird hangs upside down in your presence, it may be a sign that he likes you and trusts you., Parakeets use their beaks for a variety of purposes, from physical tasks to conveying messages. If your bird is performing any of the following activities, it is typically a sign of happiness and comfort around you.


Grinding the beak, left to right in the same way that people grind their teeth, is a sign of happiness in parakeets.Mouthing with the beak, without actually biting, is one way parakeets play with one another. If your bird is gently mouthing you with his beak, without actually trying to bite you, it is probably a sign of affection.Regurgitating in front of or "at" a person is a sign of tremendous affection.This is particularly true if your parakeet displays signs of eye pinning and head bobbing immediately before regurgitating.

 90% of EZ Go Carts have simple springs which limit the speed of the engine. To raise the top speed of your golf cart, all you need to do is locate this spring and tighten it slightly. If you cannot find this spring, you likely have a newer model that is more difficult to adjust, though this is rare., Remove the seat cousins, which hide the engine. You may have to unscrew the seat in newer models., There should be five screws in most models. The engine is in the front of golf carts, underneath this panel. Take off the plastic cover and set it aside with the seats.
 This is the governor. The spring apparatus will have two nuts, one small nut and one larger nut, holding it onto the rod.


If you are curious, this is your cart's carburetor.
 The more you tighten the larger nut, the faster your cart will go. Start slowly, only tightening the nut a quarter turn to start. You can over-stress the engine if you try to run it too quickly, and it will skip and potentially burn out if you are too eager., Test the speed of the cart. After you are satisfied with how fast your cart goes, tighten the small nut back up. As you test, listen for whining noises, skips, or odd clunking movement in the cart-- this means you've tightened the governor too much and need to dial it back., Put the cart back together how you found it and enjoy your ride.
 You'll likely need to get repairs and replacement parts faster on a cart with an adjusted governor. In addition, any cart that can go above 19mph is officially a motor vehicle, and you legally need seatbelts and inspections. This shouldn't be a big problem, but it is worth knowing.

 Compare products and prices. There can often be a huge difference in price for similar products.
 Chances are you’ll find something that will give you 10%-20% off your order making it well worth a couple of minutes time!

, Consider also ordering a vase and any add-ons like balloons, stuffed animals, or any other additional gifts. Most flower delivery sites have partnered with top brand names making it possible to send very nice gifts from fancy chocolates, full gift baskets, and teddy!


Even though the upgraded vases may seem a little expensive, its worth a couple of extra dollars since the cheapest vase is usually going to be pretty cheap looking. This is especially important if you are having your roses delivered to someone’s workplace where your roses will be judged by any and all coworkers.
 If you can’t think of anything original to say you can “borrow” something from a greeting card or even a line from a love poem. Your card is your chance to really convey your emotions and why you’re sending these lovely roses in the first place.
 Make sure you have all your mom's information, including full name and deliver address. Often they will also need a phone number in case the delivery cannot be made or they need to contact the recipient to complete delivery. Have your debit card, credit card, and etc ready to pay.
 Give your mom a call on Mother's Day (she'll love to hear your voice!) and wish her a happy Mother's Day. In the process, she's sure to thank you for the flowers; if she doesn't, make sure she received them so that you can go back to the online flower store if she hasn't!

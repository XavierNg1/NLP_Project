 Search for cmd.exe or the "Command Prompt" shortcut and open it. On Windows XP, instead navigate to Start â†’ Run and type in cmd.exe, then hit enter. This will open the command-line interpreter. Here, depending on the permissions settings on your system, you may be able to enable Regedit from here.


You may need to right click the shortcut and select "Run as administrator."

, Type this in exactly as it appears, then hit Enter on your keyboard to run the command: REG add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /t Reg_dword /v DisableRegistryTools /f /d 0

, If you still can't access regedit, try restarting your computer and testing it again.
 If the Run command is disabled too, copy that line of code into a new Notepad file. Save it as EnableRegistry.bat and close Notepad. Right-click the file and select "Run as administrator." The command line should flash for a brief moment, as it runs the code.Test regedit again, or restart your computer.


On Windows XP, you can open the file normally instead of running as administrator.

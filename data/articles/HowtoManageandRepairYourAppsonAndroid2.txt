 Locate the icon of a white shopping bag with a triangle on it. Tap to open the Play Store.
 This will slide open the left menu panel.
 You will be taken to a screen that lists all the apps installed on your Android device.
 Scroll down the list and look for the app that has been crashing. If an “Update” option is available adjacent to it, tap it to start updating the app. Wait for it to complete.
 Once the update is complete, exit Google Play and launch the app that you just updated. Hopefully it will be fixed now.

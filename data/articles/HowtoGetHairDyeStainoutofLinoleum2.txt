 Rubbing alcohol runs the risk of staining your linoleum surface, so before applying rubbing alcohol on the stain, itâ€™s important to test it first on your linoleum. Add rubbing alcohol to a cotton ball, then dab the cotton ball on an inconspicuous area of your linoleum surface, such as in a corner.Wait about 10 minutes, then check on the area. If the linoleum has lightened considerably or has turned a different color, do not use the rubbing alcohol on the stain.
 Apply rubbing alcohol liberally to a clean cloth, then dab at the stain with the cloth so that the rubbing alcohol transfers to the stain., After dabbing the stain and coating it in rubbing alcohol, let the stain sit for several minutes to allow the rubbing alcohol to sink in and start dislodging the dye stain., After letting the rubbing alcohol soak in for a few minutes, start dabbing again at the hair dye stain with the damp cloth. Dab until the stain is completely removed or you are no longer lifting any more stain.

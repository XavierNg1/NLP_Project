 Every other day is a good rule of thumb for most beginners. Just like with other sports, it is necessary to rest your muscles and to review your technique, in order to improve. Rock climbing is no different. Don’t climb with pulled muscles. You’ll need all of your strength to climb rocks successfully.
 Eat complex carbohydrates after your climb. Eat green vegetables, like grains, starchy vegetables, beans, and peas. Some people like to eat dark chocolate as well.
 Drink water before the climb and between climbs. Cramps are caused by dehydration. Your hands and feet are the first parts of your body to start cramping when you become dehydrated. You don’t want to cramp up on the wall. Always replace the fluids you lose through sweating from the climb. , If you are tired, your brain won’t function well enough to properly assess each step. You’ll be more likely to fall, which can be discouraging and hurt your overall motivation.

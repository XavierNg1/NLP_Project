 Interact positively with your cat every day. For example, take some time to hold it. Some cats will purr if you scratch them around the neck. You can even sleep with your cat to give you more time together., Do not punish it because a stressed cat will not purr. Instead of punishing your cat, encourage it through positive reinforcement. For example, praise it consistently when it does things correctly., Try to provide an environment that lets it perform natural cat behaviors, like hunting, climbing, and hiding. Give your cat perches and opportunities to climb. And give it toys that look or act like prey so it can practice hunting. Cats also need to use their claws, so provide it with a scratching post.Hide treats or catnip for it to find.
 Get a laser light, some yarn, or feathers on a string and let your cat pounce on these. Keep the items moving so they simulate prey. Roll items to your cat and it will roll them back to you. You can even try playing fetch.Give your cat items to investigate, like balls of aluminum foil or paper towel and toilet paper rolls that it can also bat around.
Crinkle up some wrapping paper for it to play with.

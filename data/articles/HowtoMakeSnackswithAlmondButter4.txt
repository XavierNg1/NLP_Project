 You'll need whole roasted almonds, salt, and honey to taste to make almond butter. Add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt for every 1 1/2 cups of almonds you use. Start with 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of honey, though you may want a bit more, depending on your taste preferences.


Roasted almonds make for a more flavorful spread. If you have raw almonds, you can toast them on an unlined baking sheet for 12 to 15 minutes at 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius)., Use a food processor to blend the almonds and the salt together. You may need to pulse it a few times at first. Keep blending the almonds and salt together until they form a relatively smooth paste.


If it's not smooth enough for your tastes, you can add a bit of a neutral oil, such as grapeseed oil, to help smooth things out., Next, pour the honey into the food processor. Blend the mixture again until the honey is fully mixed in. Taste the almond butter to see if it needs more salt or honey. Adjust as needed, and blend again. Place in an airtight jar, and use as you would any almond butter.


Another good addition at this point is a dash or two of cinnamon, which brings warmth to your almond butter.

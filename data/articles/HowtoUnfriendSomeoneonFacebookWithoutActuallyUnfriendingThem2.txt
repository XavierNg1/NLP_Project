 Perhaps you have several dozen friends who constantly talk politics; whatever your rationale is, you can mass-unfollow friends from the Facebook menu.


If you aren't logged in, you'll need to enter your login email and password.
 The menu button is the downward-facing arrow in the top right corner of your screen; clicking this will prompt a drop-down menu with links to general Facebook settings., This will open a small menu with settings regarding your News Feed.
 This will take you to a list of all your Facebook friends.
 Note that Facebook will not ask you for confirmation before unfollowing each clicked friend.


Click "Done" when you're finished. You will no longer see posts from these friends!

, You may need to refresh your page before these changes take place.

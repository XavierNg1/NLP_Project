, Cut each leaf of gelatin into small pieces. Place into a heatproof bowl.

Cover the leaf pieces with liquid. This shouldn't be a lot of liquid––just enough to cover.
Leave to one side. Allow it to soften for at least 10 minutes before using.
 Pour some of the liquid you're using to make the jelly into a small pan. Bring to a simmer, and keep it cooking gently.

Place the heatproof bowl of softened gelatin leaf pieces (see previous section) on the water.
Keep heating gently until the gelatin melts. Stir frequently. The melting time will take around 10 minutes, longer if you're using milk.
 Stir well., The sieve will catch undissolved gelatin (which will make the jelly gritty if not removed)., Skim off any surface bubbles unless they're not an issue––just be aware that any bubbles showing on the surface will set too., Leave to set. This will take at least six hours.

If you have strong odors in the fridge, cover the jelly mold with an upturned plate, plastic kitchen wrap or a lid, to prevent the flavors melding with the jelly.
 This tends to be many a cook's least favorite part of making jelly, for fear of breakage. Be prepared for some trial and error. In a nutshell, here is how to unmold:

Place the jelly container in a bowl of warm water, the raw edge of the jelly facing upward and out of the water.
When you see the jelly loosening or melting a little at the sides, it may be ready to release from the mold. This can take anywhere from a few seconds to a half a minute.
Tip over and land the jelly on the serving plate. If you wet the plate before doing this, you will be able to align the jelly exactly where you want it to be on the plate.

 Open the file of the picture you want to edit. Go to the "Image" selection. Scroll down to "Adjustments." Highlight this option. Another selection box will open. One of the choices is "Curves." Select this option. This will open a graph like box with a line in the middle of it.
 By moving the line upward, you will notice the picture becomes brighter. By moving the line downward, the picture becomes darker.
 Once you achieve the desired result, go to the "File" menu option and click the "Save As" option.

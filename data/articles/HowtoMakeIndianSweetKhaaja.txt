 Take all purpose flour in a big bowl and gradually add water in small quantity. Crumble all together to prepare hard dough.;
, Take 1 tsp of all purpose flour and 1 tsp or more oil/ghee to make a paste. This is required to brush over the chapati which will be prepared later. This makes khaja layers non sticky.
 From the dough make a medium size roll and make a long chapati like naan.
 Brush the paste of oil/ghee and all purpose flour over the chapati.
 Roll it like a wrap as as shown in the video.
 Using a knife, cut the wrap diagonally in equal sizes.
 Heat oil in a deep bottomed pan and deep fry the khaja pieces on medium low flame. Fry it until khaja becomes light golden in color.
 Once it is fried, take out in a separate plate or container.
 Take approximately half cup of water and 3/4th cup of sugar in a pan and cook it on high flame. Bring it to boil and make sure to Keep stirring to avoid burning of sugar. Syrup should be boiled till it reaches itâ€™s crystallization point.

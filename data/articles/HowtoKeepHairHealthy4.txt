 The quality of your diet defines the quality of your hair’s health. To promote scalp health and hair growth, consume foods rich in protein, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K.In addition to promoting hair growth, omega-3 fatty acids also leave your mane shiny and full. Salmon and avocados are an excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids.Greek yogurt, milk, and eggs are excellent sources of protein and vitamins B and D.Mangos, kale, spinach, sweet potatoes, avocados, and apples are excellent sources of vitamins A, C, E, and K., Since each strand of hair is composed of 25% water, staying hydrated is essential to your mane’s health.Medical professionals recommend drinking between ½ to 1 ounce of water per pound each day.Failure to consistently meet this recommendation could result in brittle, frizzy hair.For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, you would need to drink between 75 to 150 ounces of water per day.
 Like a well-balanced diet, a good night’s sleep is essential for your body to function. When you deprive yourself of sleep, your health—including the health of your hair—suffers. In an effort to conserve energy, your body will stop completing functions it deems unnecessary, such as hair growth. To keep your body functioning properly, and your hair growing, aim to sleep between 6 to 10 hours each night.

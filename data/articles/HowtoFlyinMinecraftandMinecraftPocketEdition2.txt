 If you didn't allow cheats when you created a single-player world, you can still enable them inside the world:


Computer Edition: Hit Esc to open the menu. Select Open to LAN. Click Allow Cheats, then Start LAN World. This will enable cheats until you return to the main menu.
Pocket Edition: Go to Settings → Game → Cheats: On.Note: On a multiplayer server, only administrators and operators have access to the console.Ask one to put you in spectator mode, where you can fly but cannot interact with anything.
 Open chat and type in /gamemode c to enter Creative Mode. (On devices with a keyboard, chat should open automatically when you hit /). This automatically enables flying.


Creative Mode also makes you immune to damage and give you an unlimited inventory.
 This can be finicky, so try it a couple times if it doesn't work.
 Once you've started flying, holding down the jump button will lift you into the air.
 Hold down the sneak button (Left ⇧ Shift on a computer) to sink down to the ground. If you touch the ground, you will stop flying.
 When you'd like to return to normal Survival Mode, type /gamemode s. Be careful: if you are flying, you will fall to the ground.

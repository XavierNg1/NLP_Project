 You can use Google to search by image instead of text. Google will attempt to find other copies of the same image on the internet, as well as provide visually similar images. This can help you determine where the picture originated from, and potentially find more pictures of the same person. You can search from images that have been saved to your computer, or you can search using the image's URL.


To find an image's address, right-click on it and select "Copy image address/URL."
To save an image to your computer, right-click on it and select "Save image."
If you're using a mobile device, click here instead.;
, Visit images.google.com in your browser. You'll see the familiar Google search field.
 This will allow you to search by image.
 There are two ways to search by image:


Select "Paste image URL" and paste the copied address into the field.
Select "Upload an image" and browse for the image that you saved to your computer.
 A list of search results will be displayed. If the image was found in other sizes, these will be displayed at the top. Pages where the same image can be found will be displayed beneath, and visually similar images can be found at the bottom of the first page of results.

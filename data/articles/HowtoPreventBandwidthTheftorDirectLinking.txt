 The most effective way of stopping direct linking. You must have your own domain, AND your webserver/host must support Mod Rewrite.
 By encrypting your HTML, people will have a very hard time reading your source code. This is a great alternative if your webhost does not support Mod Rewrite. There are hundreds of programs that allow you to encrypt your HTML, but most of them charge a small fee. There is good news, though. I've found a JavaScript-based encryptor that you can use for free at HTML Encryption Utility.

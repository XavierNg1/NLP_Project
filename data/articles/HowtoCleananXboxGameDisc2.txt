 Since toothpaste is slightly abrasive, you can use it to polish off light scratches on the surface of your disc. Make sure that it is not a whitening or bleaching toothpaste, as these contain chemicals that can damage the disc.Baking soda toothpaste will give the best results. Avoid gel-based toothpastes.
 You don't need much, a little smaller than a pea should be sufficient.
 Just a drop or two should be enough, you want to be able to make a paste with the toothpaste, but not turn it too runny.
 If you're using your finger, make sure that you've cleaned it first to remove excess oils. Apply gentle pressure and rub back and forth over the scratch to polish it out.


Rub from the center towards the edge, not in a circular motion.
 Make sure that all of the excess toothpaste has been removed from the disc surface. Allow the disc to air dry after rinsing it off.
 If the scratches are too much for toothpaste to handle, your only other option may be professional resurfacing. This is usually a pretty expensive process, and if the game is older it may be cheaper to just buy a new copy.


Check your local used video game, music, or movie stores to see if they offer disc resurfacing services.

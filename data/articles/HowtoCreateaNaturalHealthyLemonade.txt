If using a fresh lemon: Using the knife, cut your lemon into two large pieces with a single slice down the middle, and put one aside (you will only need 1/2 a lemon). Slit the lemon's flesh several times so the juice will be released easier. Squeeze as much juice as possible out into the drinking glass. Remove seeds, if any.
If using lemon juice: Measure out 2 tablespoons (20mL) of lemon juice and add it to your drinking glass. Vary the amount depending on personal preferences.
 Only add up to 3/4 of the glass' full capacity, because you will need room to add ice cubes and honey.
 Stir it in thoroughly with the spoon so no honey can be seen remaining at the bottom of the glass.
 If the cup is overflowing, add only one or two. You can also fill the cup with more water if it is not yet full after the ice cubes are added.
 There's the simplest, healthiest, most refreshing lemonade you can get! Add a straw, and maybe a stirring stick, and enjoy!

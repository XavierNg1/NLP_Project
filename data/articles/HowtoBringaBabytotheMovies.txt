 These are much easier on both you and the baby because crying is actually not an issue! Usually the cinema will turn up the sound to drown out crying, so if you have an ultra-sensitive baby, you might like to take the sound into account, or ask the cinema if this is what they do.;
, It's more fun when you're going with a friend and the babies know one another.
 Obviously, extra diapers in case of an accident. Most cinemas have baby changing areas by law.
 Here are some things to consider if this is the case:


If the baby starts crying, excuse yourself from the theater for a little bit. Try to sit at the end of an aisle near an exit so that you can make quick departures and returns if needed. A small keyring LED light (red light) can be helpful to have for this situation.
Sometimes people do not like children. Try to ignore it if someone makes a face. If they are rude to you, be polite but firm that you are entitled to be there too (but still remove the crying baby).
Bring your baby a quiet toy or bottle to try to calm your baby down or to keep her distracted.
 This might be the case with older infants who are actually watching the movie.
 This will keep baby quiet and distracted, as well as well-fed!

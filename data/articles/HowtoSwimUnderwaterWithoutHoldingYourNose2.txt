 Swim along the shorter length of the pool near the edge while you follow the steps below. Using a shorter distance and the edge as a guide will allow you to build up to bigger challenges.



Try this a few times before actually swimming all the way across.
If you find that water is going up your nose after you kick off, repeat the process.
Make sure that you are exhaling through your nose while you push off of the side of the pool.
 Once you have gotten used to pushing off of the edge of the pool without holding your nose, start swimming across the pool.


While using strokes such as Freestyle, Froggy, or Butterfly, where you are swimming "horizontally," keep your head facing down towards the bottom of the pool.
As always, make sure that you are blowing air out through your nose while your head is submerged.Come up for air after 1-3 "strokes" or as needed, then dip your head back into the water, exhaling through your nose.

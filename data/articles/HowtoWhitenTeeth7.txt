 Avoid tobacco products, and either cut out liquids like coffee, black tea, grape juice, colored sodas, and red wine, or drink them through a straw. Curry can also stain your teeth, so eat it judiciously.
 Also, brush your teeth after you drink a beverage that can darken your teeth. Maintain your whitened teeth by using whitening toothpaste and whitening mouthwash.


If you have consumed something acidic, wait about 30 minutes before brushing. Acidity can weaken your enamel, and brushing before it has a chance to harden can actually cause more damage.
 A professional cleaning will help you to keep your teeth white as well as preventing many common dental problems.

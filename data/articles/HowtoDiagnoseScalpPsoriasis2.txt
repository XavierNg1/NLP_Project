 A general doctor will likely be able to diagnose scalp psoriasis, though they may also send you to a dermatologist if they're not sure whether it's psoriasis or another condition. Either way, you need a solid diagnosis so you know how to move forward with treatment., The main way a doctor diagnoses scalp psoriasis is through physical examination. The doctor will ask you questions about your medical history, and then they will take a look at the skin condition on your scalp to determine if it really is psoriasis., Occasionally, your doctor may take a skin biopsy. However, that is generally rare when diagnosing scalp psoriasis. It's usually done when there's some question about what condition you have. In that case, a small sample of skin is taken from your head and sent to be tested in a lab to help determine your condition.Your doctor will use a local anesthetic to prevent pain when performing the biopsy.
 Your doctor will recommend a treatment plan. They may start you out on shampoos designed to treat psoriasis, usually tar shampoos or ones with salicyclic acid. You'll also likely use creams or other topical treatments, both in steroid and non-steroid forms.Be sure to use the shampoos just on your scalp, not all over your hair.
Your doctor may also inject steroids into some of your lesions to help slow down the reaction.
Other treatments can include things like ultraviolet light, oral retinoids (a form of synthetic vitamin A), and antimicrobial medications (if you develop a yeast infection).

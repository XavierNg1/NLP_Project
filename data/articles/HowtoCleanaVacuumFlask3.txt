 Flush the flask with clean water. Dump the water down the drain and refill it with a moderate amount of clean water. Insert a small amount (roughly a handful) of uncooked rice to the water. Add a few drops of a mild detergent, like dish soap.In place of uncooked rice, you can substitute crushed eggshells. Boil an egg to clean the shells. Peel the egg and crush the shells with your clean hands. Add these to the flask in the same fashion and amount as uncooked rice., Cap the flask firmly to prevent leaking. Use a variety of motions while shaking the flask: swirl the solution back and forth, tip the bottle upside down and rightside up. Using firm motions will clean the inside best., Dump the cleaning solution outside or down a drain. Rinse the flask thoroughly to remove any remaining rice (or eggshells) and soap. Inspect the flask for remaining dirtiness. If it is still dirty, repeat this process.

When clean, air dry the flask for about eight hours or overnight, then store the flask uncapped. This will prevent your flask from developing an unpleasant odor.

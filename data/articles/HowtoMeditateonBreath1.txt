 Find a space without loud noises or noticeable odors that might distract you. You should also avoid spaces with excessive decoration or colors that might draw your attention.Indoor spaces are less likely to have distracting sounds but you can meditate outside if you prefer the fresh air and you have some distance from cars or other people.;
, Most people sit down when they meditate so find a spot where you can sit comfortably for more than 10 minutes. Plush carpeting or soft grass are ideal. You could also lay down a yoga mat or even just a towel.
 Turn off or silence your phone and anything else that might make a noise. If there are other people around, tell them you plan to meditate and ask to be left alone for the next few minutes. If you have pets that may come looking for attention, put them in another room where they can’t distract you.


Tell other people in the house “Please do not disturb me for the next 30 minutes unless it’s an emergency. I will be meditating and need to maintain absolute focus.”

, There are many different positions you can use for meditation. The key is to choose a position that is comfortable and won’t require you to consciously prop yourself up.Some meditators purchase a zafu, a small floor pillow, or a zabuton, a small padded mat, to help prop them up.
The most popular posture is the lotus position. Sit on the floor with your back straight. Place your left foot under your right thigh and right foot layered over the left ankle. If you are meditating for a long period of time, you may want to switch which foot goes under the thigh after a while.
Some meditators sit in a chair. Make sure you keep your back straight and your feet flat on the ground.

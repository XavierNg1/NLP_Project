 It is not your fault that you are being harassed. You, like everyone else, deserve to feel safe., Tell the bully "No! Stop it!" in a loud, assertive voice and then walk or run away if you feel you need to.Standing up to the bully, simply by saying "no," sends a message that you are not afraid and will not accept his or her behavior. Bullies tend to go after kids who don't stick up for themselves and who they think will take their abuse and do whatever they say.
There's always strength in numbers. Kids can stand up for each other by telling a bully to stop teasing or scaring someone else, and then walk away together.
 Plan ahead. How can you stop yourself from getting angry or showing you're upset?


Try to distract yourself. Count backwards from 100, sing your favorite song inside your head, spell words backwards, etc. Keep your mind occupied until you are out of the situation so that you can moderate your feelings and not give the bully his or her desired reaction.
 Don't hit, kick, or push as a way to deal with someone bullying you or your friends.Fighting back satisfies bullies because it shows them that they can get to you.


Fighting back can also be dangerous. Someone could get hurt and you could get in trouble. It's best to stay with others, stay safe, and find the nearest adult.

 Making eye contact is a good way to do this. If needed, you can use a small wave or light touch to get the person's attention. While you should be considerate and not poke people, generally it is not considered rude in deaf communities to lightly touch people you do not know to get their attention. The shoulder is a good place to touch someone you don't know well; use a couple of short taps., Once they know the general topic, it is easier for them to follow your conversation. Try not to change the subject suddenly without pausing to signal the change.Pause often and ask if they are following you.
 If there is an interruption that the deaf person may not notice, such as the phone ringing or a knock on the door, explain why you are stepping away. Otherwise the deaf person may think you finished speaking to them, and this can come off as impolite., If there is a sign language interpreter present to help you communicate, it is important to direct your conversation toward the person, not the interpreter (or other hearing companion). An interpreter will best understand how to help the deaf person grasp what you are saying, so don't worry about them., As the conversation comes to a close, you may offer to provide a quick summary of what was said. This can be helpful for some deaf people, yet unnecessary for others, so always ask first.You might say, "Would it helpful for me to summarize what we just talked about?"

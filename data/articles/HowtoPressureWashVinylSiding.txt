 A gasoline or electric washer with a pressure rating of around 2,000 PSI will provide enough force to effectively clean high, hard-to-reach vinyl surfaces. Set the spray nozzle to low pressure and use a 25-degree spray tip. Add an appropriate cleaning solution (such as a vinyl siding cleanser concentrate or mild dish detergent) to the reservoir.;
, Proper preparation is the key to successful vinyl exterior cleaning. It will make the job quicker and easier for people who prefer to do it themselves..


Remove any obstacles from the surrounding area. You may need to temporarily relocate any patio furniture, planters, etc.
Dampen and cover nearby plants or gardens to protect them from the high pressure spray and cleaning chemicals. You can use any non-porous cover such as a tarp or plastic tablecloth.
Cover all exposed outlets or electrical wires. If outlet covers do not exist, seal them with plastic and water-proof tape.
Remove dense areas of mold or mildew with a mixture of household bleach and water. Scrub the area by hand and rinse thoroughly with clean, fresh water.
 You may increase or decrease the power of the spray by adjusting either the nozzle setting or the distance at which you are holding the wand from the siding.
 Always ensure that the nozzle is pointed downward at a 45-degree angle to minimize the amount of water that gets behind the siding. Excessive water can bulge siding, dampen insulation or framework, and cause mold or electrical damage over time.
 Work from the top down to prevent streaks, and rinse within approximately 5-to-10 minutes of cleaning, before the detergent is able to dry.

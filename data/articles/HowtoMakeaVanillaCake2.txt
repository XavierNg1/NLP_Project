 Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 176 degrees Celsius. Dust an eight-inch cake pan with flour and spread melted butter or oil over it using a pastry brush.
 Using an electric or hand blender, cream the butter and sugar on medium for about two minutes. The results should have a bright yellow color and should be fluffy.
 Add the egg whites and vanilla into the creamed mixture. Blend on medium for one minute.
 Add the flour, baking powder, and baking soda into a bowl. Use a wooden spoon to combine the dry ingredients.
 Slowly pour ⅓ of your flour mixture into the creamed mixture.
 Add ½ of your milk and add it to the batter. Blend on medium speed.
 Continue these two steps three times. Ensure you blend each time correctly. This process is what helps the cake stay moist and fluffy.
 Use a rubber spatula to scrape up all the cake batter into the cake pan.
 Place the cake pan into the oven. Have it bake for about 35 minutes, which is when the cake springs back when you touch it, and a toothpick comes out dry when you poke the cake.
 Flip the cake pan upside down on a wire rack. To make the cake easier to flip, circle a knife around it. It should pop out. Have the cake cool for about five minutes.
 Using your favorite frosting and icing, frost your cake to your liking. You can also add toppings such as sliced fruit, sprinkles, nuts, chocolate chips, and coconut flakes.

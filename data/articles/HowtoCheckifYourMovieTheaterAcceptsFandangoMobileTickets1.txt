, Below the banner, you will see a search box with an orange “Go” button to the right. Type your zip code in that search box, then click “Go.”


A list of movie theaters with their showtimes will come up on the next page.
 Scroll down through the list of movie theaters until you find the theater you want to go to.


Each movie theater’s name is in a black bar. Movie theaters that work with Fandango have icons at the far right of the bar showing what Fandango services they support.
If your movie theater takes the Fandango Mobile Ticket, you will see a white icon of a smartphone silhouette on the black background.

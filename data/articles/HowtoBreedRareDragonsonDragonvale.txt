 In order to breed dragons, you will need to have unlocked the Breeding Island or Breeding Cave. This is where you can send two dragons to breed and produce an egg. The egg will need to incubate for a certain amount of time before it hatches, depending on the breed the egg contains.;
, When you select two dragons to breed, the game will calculate what dragon you receive based on certain odds. Generally, there are three types of results you can expect from a breeding: Common, Rare, and Epic. The one you get is purely chance-based, and Rares and Epics have very low percentages.
 The rarest dragons are bred from combinations of previous, lesser dragons. You will need to go through several breeding processes before you have the right dragons to breed the super rare ones.
 The rarest dragons can take a very long time to hatch, but once you see that long incubation time you'll know that you have something good on your hands.
 These are the few dragons that can result from breeding opposite elements.Opposite Element Dragons

* The two hybrids should contain a total of four different elements (e.g. Glacier + Firefly). You may also get a regular Rainbow Dragon.
** Crystal Dragon + Blue Fire Dragon gives the most success. For a Moon Dragon, breed at night. For a Sun Dragon, breed during the day.
*** The two dragons should combine for Air, Fire, and Plant elements (e.g. Blazing Dragon + Plant Dragon).
 These dragons can only be bred during specific times, and some may no longer be available. If the dragon is available to purchase, it is available to be bred. Sometimes dragons from past events are available during special events.

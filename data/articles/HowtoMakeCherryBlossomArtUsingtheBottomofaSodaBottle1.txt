 Make sure the bottles have the five bumpy ridges on the bottom--the ridges are an essential part of your project. For best results, empty the bottle and then clean soda with hot soapy water. Allow enough time to dry so you arenâ€™t working with a wet bottle.


Provide one bottle per artist or per color if you plan to use multiple colors.;
, You will be dipping the bottom of the soda bottle in paint and then transferring it to the paper. This means the bottom of the bottle will be coated in paint and will dry with a bit of a three-dimensional design (which requires a heavier paper to hold the additional paint).
 Tempera paint works well with this project because of its consistency and the non-toxic aspect. Choose several colors to design multi-colored cherry blossoms or stick with the traditional pale pink.


Pick up a bottle of black and/or brown paint and a paint brush to create the cherry blossom tree branches and trunk.
 You will spread the newspaper on a table to create a workspace for your artist. A simple paper plate can hold your paint, but make sure you have enough plates per artist and color.


Consider finding old shirts to use as smocks in order to protect clothing, especially if you are doing this craft with children.

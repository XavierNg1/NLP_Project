 Locate the Cubby app on your device. It’s the app with a white background with the letter “C” on it. Tap on it.
 If you’re already logged in, you may skip this step. Otherwise, input your LogMein ID email address and password in the appropriate fields, and then tap the “Log In” button to proceed.


All your existing cubbies or main folders will be displayed on your screen.
 Navigate through your cubbies and folders until you see the item you want to share. You can share whole cubbies, folders, and files through public links. Beside each item is an information icon. Tap on it to bring out the “Info and menu” window.
 On the window, locate the option for “Public Link.” Tap on the toggle button next to it to enable the feature. Once enabled, a direct link will be available for the selected cubby, folder, or file. When this link is accessed, it will direct the user to the item being shared.
 Under the “Public Link” option are two buttons, representing the two sharing options directly from the app.


Email Link—Tap the “Email Link” button to bring out your default email client. The composition window will be brought up, and the public link to the selected item is already embedded in the message body. Complete the email and send it out. All the recipients of your email will get the link and can access the cubby, folder, or file.
Copy Link—Tap the “Copy Link” button to copy the public link to your clipboard. You can now manually share and distribute this link to others via email, IM, Facebook, Twitter, or other social media. Anyone who gets this link can get and download the cubby, folder, or file under it.

 Set your DV camera to VST/VCR mode and connect it to the computer using a Firewire cable. The import window will open automatically.
 Click import, making sure that the switch on the left side of the import window is set to "Automatic." Select a location to store the project using the "Save to" pop-up menu. Type a name for the project in the "Create new event" field and click OK. The analog to digital conversion is complete.

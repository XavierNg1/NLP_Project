, It must be large enough for the child to sit in it and sturdy., This will give the simple cardboard box a curved look., Either paint the box or add plain paper to it. If painting, choose a good color for a boat, and paint on some portholes, an anchor and the boat's name. If covering in paper, use markers to decorate it with.

Consider adding some blue waves at the base of the box. This will give the impression of being at sea.
Allow to dry if painting.
Decorative elements such as glitter, stickers, etc. can be attached to the boat too.
 This is optional. Keep it simple - glue a long cardboard roll to the front center of the box. Attach a white paper triangle to the roll. One simple sail!

You might like to add a flag as well.
 Have your child choose where to launch the boat and let your child sail the carpet or hardwood seas.

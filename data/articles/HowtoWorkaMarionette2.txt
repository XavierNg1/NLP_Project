 Hold the back string in your left hand and lower the control. Tilting the front end of the control up at the same time the marionette will raise his arms.
 Pull the left front string up (raises left hand) or down (raises right hand) to move the hands. Pulling the left string up and out simultaneously will lift both hands.
 These work in the same way as the hands, but with the string that is attached to the legs.
 Pull the leg string up and down so that the feet make a walking motion, whilst moving the marionette forward will create a simple movement to this effect.
 Dancing is great fun with a puppet, and can be done in multiple ways. One such way is to make a walking movement again, but instead of moving the control forwards, bounce it up and down. Once you have mastered this, hold the right hand and left leg string together and move them up and down, up and down. To create the best effect, tip the control from side to side as he dances to make his head tilt in time with the music.

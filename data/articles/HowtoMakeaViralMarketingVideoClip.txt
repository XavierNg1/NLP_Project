 Pre-camera planning is often the most crucial process for getting the viral video strategy right. Some basic brainstorming can do wonders for an ad process that relies on impulsive elements like viral video.;
, Who is your ad targeting and why? Solving both of these questions, not just one, will get viral marketers closer to success.


Come up with key viral concepts. For some, this might seem like magic, but working up a viral marketing message doesn't have to be rocket science. Start with a few basic categories, the "cute," the "hilarious," the "shocking," and so forth, and you'll find that penciling in viral video ideas might be easier than you expected, and fun, too.
 One of the main elements of a viral video that includes more than one person is the cast. There's also a need for a crew, unless the single video subject can also manipulate the camera.
 Pros suggest keeping it simple, and getting right into shooting, rather than weighing the whole thing down with precise expectations. Do the hard work of shooting the video, and the general edit, and you'll have your viral video product ready to go.


Keep costs low. Most viral video is not a huge investment, and there's no need to pad the expense account any more than necessary. Rely on concepts to sell your ideas rather than video quality.
 Here's where it's critical to think about how the video is going to get into the hands of viewers. There are different ways to go for this process, so think through the idea of distribution carefully.


Get access to popular programs. Venues like YouTube and Facebook may be free, but anyone who wants to post on them must still work out a profile and basic user record. Figure this time into your project.

 Start by making sure human food is out of reach for your dog. Store human food that is uncooked or packaged, such as cereal, crackers, chips, canned goods, and sweets in cupboards or on high shelves.Make sure the shelves are high enough that your dog cannot reach them by standing on its hind legs. If your dog is tall, store human food in cupboards with doors that can be shut to keep your dog from getting at it.;
, If your kitchen has a pantry or a long cupboard you can use as a pantry, store human food in there to keep it away from your dog. Designate the pantry as the spot where you keep human food in your kitchen so your dog cannot get into it easily.
 When you cook human food, let it cool in your kitchen on a high counter, where your dog cannot reach. You can also keep cooked food in the oven to cool with the door slightly ajar. Often, dogs are turned away by the heat from the oven and cannot open the oven door on its own.Get in the habit of keeping cooked food in the middle of an island in your kitchen or on a high table to cool so your dog cannot access it.
 If you are serving prepared human food, such as at a dinner or a lunch, keep it on high tables. Make sure your dinner table is high enough that your dog cannot reach the food. Or position the food on the dinner table so it is away from the edges, where your dog cannot access.


Remind others in your home to avoid keeping human food on tables that are low or easy for your dog to reach. Tell everyone to be careful when lifting food to the table.
 If any human food falls on the floor during a meal, pick it up quickly before the dog can get at it. Doing this will discourage your dog from having human food and prevent begging at the table.


Remind those in your household to always pick up dropped human food before the dog can get it. Make it a habit so it becomes an automatic reflex when human food is being prepared and the dog is around.

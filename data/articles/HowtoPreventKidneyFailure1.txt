 Obesity has been linked to kidney damage. If you are overweight, or are afraid you are going to become overweight, exercise daily. When you are overweight, your kidneys have to work overtime to keep you healthy. You should try to exercise for 30 to 45 minutes, four or five days a week.Some exercises you can incorporate into your work week include running, cycling, swimming, and walking. Try to pick one (or a couple) that you enjoy so that you are more motivated to work out each day.
If you are elderly, the recommended exercise each week is 15 minutes for three days a week.;
, Tobacco smoke does serious damage to your kidneys. There are more than 4000 particles and gases found in cigarette smoke, many of which can damage your kidney. Cigarettes are also linked to kidney fibrosis, which is when your kidney tissue turns hard, causing kidney failure.Cigarette smoke can also cause hypertension, which is elevated blood pressure.
 Alcohol can also cause kidney damage. When metabolized, alcohol becomes aldehyde, a harmful chemical that can hurt your kidneys and liver. Alcohol also increases your chances of heart disease and diabetes., Any drug that you put in your body gets absorbed by the blood and then filtered by the kidneys. These drugs can have a harmful effect on your kidney and could lead to kidney failure if your kidneys have to process too many harmful toxins.For example, cocaine may cause myolysis. Myolysis is the breakdown of muscle mass, which can result in kidney failure.
 This is particularly important to do if your bacterial infection is in your kidney or urinary tract. You will have to take antibacterial medication to treat these conditions, but it will be well worth it, as a kidney dealing with a bacterial infection can be a major health risk.

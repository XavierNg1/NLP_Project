 Again, this prevents someone from controlling your body and movement completely. Set your feet so that you're on balance, and use this hand to resist their movement. Even if they are stronger than you and ultimately could pull you around, this is just the first move meant to force them off balance.
 Grab their little finger with as many of your fingers as you can. The more leverage you can get on this finger, the better.
 The quicker you can do this motion, the better. The pain and shock will open up his/her hand, allowing you to get free.









If he/she doesn't let go, keep bending until the finger breaks.
Keep your elbow up in front of your face to protect yourself from his free arm, which can still hit you.
 If you're using both hands to cut off his hair hold, then he still has one arm left to attack with. To avoid this, roll into the pinkie bend. By also following his movement (the way he is pulling your hair) you prevent damage and force him to swing or turn his body before he can strike you with his far off arm. Even if he can get small blows in, he won't have the power to do much in the few seconds before you break his pinkie.









Rolling your body along the attacker's arm also puts him in front of you, allowing you to get away once you get his hand free.
 You want to move forward into the counter-attack, and then immediately move off once the hands are out of your hair. Use the few seconds of time to get away immediately.

 You may not be able to talk during class, but sitting next to people who you like can make the classroom more enjoyable. If this isn’t possible due to assigned seating, try to be friendly with the people that surround you. Liking the people you’re in class with makes the experience a lot easier.


If you’re having trouble starting a conversation, ask about last night’s homework. If you don’t want the subject to be about school, compliment them on their hair, outfit, or backpack.
 Avoid getting into trouble during class by saving your talking for the break. Even if it’s just a few minutes, use that time to talk with your friends. If you’re teacher isn’t busy during break, you can use that time to talk with them. It doesn’t hurt to get to know your teachers.


If you don’t have a break, chat with your friends a few minutes before or after class.
 You will be spending a lot of time with your classmates, so it is good to get to know as many of them as possible. Don’t be afraid to talk to a new person. They will already have things in common with you, like age and what you’re learning. It’s especially nice to talk to the students who are shy and don’t seem to have many friends.Ask the person about their interests and what they enjoy doing outside of class.

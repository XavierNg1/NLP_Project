 Obvious of course, but if your cat doesn't respond in the first 30 seconds, she's either out of ear shot or not wanting to come in.


If this is the case, don't let your voice betray your frustration. Instead, shut the door and do something else for 5 minutes, and then try again.
A cat that is hiding may change her mind and be there the next time you call, once she realizes the open door is not permanent.;
, Only let the cat out when she is hungry. Take food away several hours beforehand so that she is partially focused on when the next meal is going to arrive.


This way when you need her back inside, if she refuses to answer to her name try shaking the box of cat biscuits. When she comes running, be sure to reward her with food.
 If it's important to get the cat inside and you can't see her, go and look. If it's raining or the cat is fearful, she may hide under a bush and refuse to move.


If she is hiding from danger, or merely keeping dry, she is unlikely to run off and you can pick her up to carry her indoors.
 When the cat is ready to come in and she appears after hours of calling, don't vent your frustration on her.


If you tell her she's a naughty girl for leading you a merry dance, or give her a gentle smack, she will associate coming inside with punishment. This will discourage her next time, and a vicious circle is established.
If you are angry about how long she kept you waiting, or because you were worried, just walk away. At least this way she does not learn an aversion to coming inside.
 On a similar note, never indulge in a game of chase to catch her. If she runs away, don't go chasing after her.


This only reinforces her decision to flee, and very few people can outrun a cat, especially if she decides to go up a tree.
The next time she sees you she will pre-emptively run and by chasing, you have taught her to run away rather than come to you.

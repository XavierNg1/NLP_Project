 Contacts that you meet from rival newspapers, magazines, and other publications may help you secure a journalism position in their company when a new job opportunity is available.
 Maintaining relationships with those you have spoken to or worked with in the past will help demonstrate your professionalism, genuineness, and integrity in regards to your career.


Correspond with your former peers, colleagues, teachers, subjects, and other contacts you have met while practicing journalism via email, telephone, or meetings.
 This will widen your network, as you will be meeting with different kinds of journalists in terms of background, experiences, geographical locations, areas of interests. Besides, this will also provide you with a number of opportunities, such as training, seminars, experiences while working with the association in different projects, to mention a few.

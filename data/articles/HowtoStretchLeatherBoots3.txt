 Pour 70% rubbing alcohol into a 2 oz (60 ml) spray bottle and tighten the spray nozzle on securely to prevent any leaks.Use 70% rubbing alcohol instead of a higher concentration. It contains 70 percent of concentrated ethanol or isopropyl alcohol by volume, which is safe to use with leather boots, but higher concentrations could prove too abrasive for the leather.
 Generously spray the rubbing alcohol over the area of the boot in need of being stretched. Make sure that the area is quite damp when done.


Do not spray areas that do not need to be stretched.
The area in need of being stretched should be sprayed evenly.
Give the rubbing alcohol 20 to 30 seconds to soak into the leather before proceeding.
 After the alcohol has soaked into the leather but before the boots dry, slip the boots over your feet. Keep the boots until they dry completely.


For best results, keep the boots on as long as possible before removing them, even after they dry.
The leather should stretch as soon as you slip the boots onto your feet. If it still does not budge, spray more rubbing alcohol over the problem area of the boot and try again.
 After you remove the boots and let them sit undisturbed for a few hours, try them on again. The leather should still be fairly stretched, and the boots should still be comfortable.


If the leather still feels a little tight, repeat the process to stretch the boots out a bit more. For even greater success the second time around, where extra-thick socks or an extra-thick layer of socks to stretch the boots out even further.

 Peel off the outer skin of the grapefruit just as you would do for an orange. Grapefruit skin is thick, so if you are having trouble making the first peel, knick the skin with a knife and peel away from this incision., After you peel away the skin, you will probably see a whitish layer around the outside of the grapefruit. Use your fingernails to peel off this layer. You can also use a knife to cut it away if you prefer.You won’t be able to peel this off all at once. Instead, peel it off in little strips or use a knife.
 Take the peeled grapefruit and separate each section. There should be about twelve sections to each grapefruit. If you want, you can cut away the membranes. The membranes add a bitter taste to the fruit, so some prefer to cut them off. However, it isn’t necessary., Take the sections of grapefruit and pile them onto a plate. To eat the grapefruit, just take a slice and enjoy! This is one of the easiest ways to prepare grapefruit.


Because the membrane is slightly bitter and tough, some prefer to prepare grapefruit in a way that removes the membrane from the fruit.

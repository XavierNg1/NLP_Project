 Use a mower or a tractor with a shredder attachment. This will remove the nutrient-rich stems and starve the roots. This will also eliminate berry production, which will reduce next year's seed bank.;
, Brambles are very sensitive to fire; however, this does not kill the roots. This method can also be used to reduce seed production.


Since brambles take 2 years to produce berries, the first year for cane growth and the second for berry production, use methods that eliminate each year's cane growth. This can help in to control brambles, but will not eradicate them.
 Place the glyphosate in a spray bottle or pump sprayer. As you cut each cane, spritz the remaining base plant with the herbicide. Dead canes do not need to be cut or treated. This is a time-consuming method, but one of the best available to combat brambles. With this method, a burn should be carried out to kill the seeds.


Wear protective clothing such as gloves, long pants, a long-sleeve shirt, and mask when spraying herbicides. Remove and wash clothing as soon as possible after spraying.
 These herbicides will kill the plants that the touch the spray, but often a repeat spray is required to reach the plants that were protected by the taller plants.

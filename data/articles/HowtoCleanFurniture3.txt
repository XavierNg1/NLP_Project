 If you’re unsure, the correct procedure is beginning with mild cleaner, then moving successively toward stronger cleaning methods depending on the furniture’s reaction (or lack of one).If you know that your furniture is stained, painted, etc., then you should employ a method appropriate to that finish.


As a general rule for cleaning wood furniture: don’t use much water, and when you do, don’t leave it on the table for long. Water can cause the wood to warp and crack.
 Use a clean cloth to go over the piece of furniture, loosening and removing any dust and dirt on the surface. Avoid feather dusters for wood furniture, as their quills can scratch wood. Instead, use cloth., Mineral spirits, e.g., paint thinner, are excellent at wearing away accumulated grime. Pour the spirits into a rag, and gently rub your furniture. Work in a well-ventilated space when using mineral spirits. Wipe up any residual cleaner with a damp cloth. Though safe for most wooden furniture, you should test an inconspicuous area (like an underside, or chair leg) to make sure your furniture doesn’t react poorly to the cleaner.
 Both of these ingredients are readily available at hardware stores.


As an alternative, commercial furniture oil is available for this same purpose.
 Pour some on top of the table, then some onto a steel wool pad. Rub the mixture in along the grain. Once finished, polish with a soft rag. This mixture works very well on both finished and unfinished wood. It will increase the gloss and durability of finished wood, and it will prevent drying and cracking in unfinished wood. Rub the oil in thoroughly and allow the furniture to air dry.


Using steel wool might sound severe, but the finish on most wooden furniture is thick enough to protect the wood itself from damage.
 Then, buff the surface, leaving little residue.
 Apply it generously with a cheesecloth, in the direction of the grain. Buff with a separate cloth afterward.

 Cats need regular exercise. They also need interaction with others. Play with your cat two to three times a day, for about ten to fifteen minutes during each play session.If you have an older or overweight cat, begin by playing for several minutes at a time and then gradually increase the duration of your play sessions.
 You can keep lifelike play interesting for your cat by rotating the toys. Instead of playing with the same toys all the time, put them in rotation. For example, you might play with a feather wand one week and the next week focus on an automated mouse., It is important that you put away your cat’s toys when you finish a play session. If the toys are left out all the time, they might lose their special appeal. Place the toys in a container with a lid and store the container in a place your cat can’t reach., It is important that you put all toys and toy-like items in a place your cat cannot access. For example, your cat might destroy its feather toy or your yarn collection if left unattended. Be sure to secure items like:Dental floss
String
Yarn
Pins and needles
Rubber bands
Plastic bags

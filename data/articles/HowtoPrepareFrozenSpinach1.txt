 First, place a large frying pan over low or medium low heat. The pan should be large enough to easily accommodate all of the frozen spinach. Once the pan has warmed up, add the frozen spinach to the pan. The spinach will hiss slightly and release some steam.


If the spinach releases a large amount of steam or makes loud cracking sounds, your pan is too hot. Reduce the heat.;
, Stir the block of frozen spinach around the pan until it becomes tender. Once tender, use your cooking utensil to break the block into smaller chunks. As the spinach warms up, continue breaking apart the spinach to help it reheat faster. The whole process will take about four to six minutes. Your spinach will be done thawing when it’s limp and very warm to the touch.


Don’t worry if there’s a lot of liquid in the pan. You will drain this away later.
Avoid overcooking the spinach. Burned spinach has a very distinct flavor.
 Place a heat-proof colander into a clean sink. Pour the reheated spinach into the colander. As it drains, use a large spoon to press out as much of the liquid as possible.If you want to reserve the cooking juices, place the colander into a large bowl or casserole dish before draining the spinach.

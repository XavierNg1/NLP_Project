, What experience do you have that's relevant to a specific job in the hospitality industry? Many hotel jobs are directly correlated to positions outside the hospitality industry. Restaurant workers often find work at hotels waiting tables, tending bar or preparing meals. Experienced landscapers can find full-time work at large properties. But even if your skills aren't directly transferable, you may be able to emphasize your relevant skills. If you have experience in telemarketing, you may be able to secure a position in reservations. If you can demonstrate superior organizational skills and the ability to multi-task you may be qualified to work at the front desk.
 Consider your areas of expertise beyond conventional job skills. Luxury hotels, in particular, have to meet the specific recreational needs of their guests. If you've earned a professional license or vocational certificate, or if you simply have a vast knowledge of the region, you may be able to find a specialized role in the hotel industry. Some of these jobs include:


Tour guide: Some hotels will offer guided tours of local attractions. People who can demonstrate a deep understanding of the region or specific activities can sometimes find jobs as guides. Avid anglers can parlay their expertise into roles as fishing guides. Some resorts may need experienced outdoors men to lead groups through rugged local terrain. If you are fluent in a foreign language � particularly Chinese, Japanese or Spanish � you may be able to find work leading groups of tourists from overseas.
Local pro: Golf and tennis resorts cater to active guests. Properties with adjacent golf courses usually have a PGA-certified professional on site to provide lessons and regulate play. Hotels with large tennis facilities will often employ a pro to oversee operations and provide instruction to guests.
Lifeguard: Luxury resorts often have large pools open to guests until the late evening. Many hotels will have a lifeguard on duty at all times to make sure that the pool is enjoyed safely.
Massage therapist: After 18 holes of golf or 3 sets of tennis, guests may opt for a relaxing massage. Many hotels are expanding the features they offer to include on-site massages. If you hold a credential in massage therapy, you may be able to find a full- or part-time position at a top resort.
Nurse: Huge resorts will often keep a licensed nurse on the premises to respond to guests' acute health issues 24 hours a day. This provides an excellent moonlighting opportunity for registered and licensed-vocational nurses or other health-care professionals.
Housekeeper: Most hotel employees work in housekeeping. Retired homemakers usually can transition into housekeeping positions very easily. Trustworthiness might be the most important quality in a hotel maid since they usually enter rooms when guests have left for the day's activities.
Sales: While you may have a background in product sales, hotel chains require sales associates to demonstrate a thorough understanding of their pricing strategy, group packages and demand generators.
 Many managers encourage workers to learn the hotel business from the ground up. This gives employees a better understanding and appreciation of all facets of the industry. Entry-level workers are regularly pulled off front-desk duties to bus tables, deliver room-services meals, or tend to any other guest needs. All new hotel workers can expect to draw graveyard shifts. Overnight duties often provide the best learning opportunities for new hotel employees, forcing workers to make decisions covering the full range of hotel functions.

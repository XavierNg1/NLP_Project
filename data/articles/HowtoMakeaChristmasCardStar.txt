 Scoring each card along the interior fold lines will make the thick paper easier to fold. To score, place the edge of a ruler along the desired fold and run one edge of a pair of scissors along the ruler, cutting partly through the paper. You can also use a ruler and a pizza cutter instead, but be careful not to press too hard.
 Apply glue to each long side-flap and press the flap along the inside of the adjacent side of the pyramid, but don’t do anything with the flaps along the base for now. Each pyramid will eventually be a point on the star.

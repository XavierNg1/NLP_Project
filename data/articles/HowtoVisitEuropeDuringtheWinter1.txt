 If you've always wanted to visit places like Greece, the Canary Islands, Sicily, and the southern parts of countries like France, Spain, and Italy, winter is a great time to do it. You won't run into the crazy crowds you do in the summer, plus you'll still get relatively warm weather (think 50s and 60s) compared to the rest of Europe., That is, if you choose cities that naturally have cold climates, you'll find that they have learned ways to deal with the cold. For instance, Prague has underground restaurants to help protect you from the cold. Additionally, many countries with colder climates specialize in warm winter drink and hearty winter food, such as hot chocolate in Switzerland and venison in Germany.Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, Germany, France, and Britain are just some countries that are beautiful in winter.
 Even in winter, some destinations are going to be more expensive than others. Before deciding on a destination, consider what you'll be able to spend. That will help guide where you go. For instance, it's often cheaper to stay in smaller towns rather than big cities. Tourist-dependent areas may also be fairly cheap in the winter.

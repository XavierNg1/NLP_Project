 You should clean your dryer vent promptly when it shows signs of needing cleaning. Clean your dryer vent if you notice any of the following:Clothing not drying during a dry cycle
Very hot clothing after a dry cycle
Excessive heat from the dryer
Larger amounts of lint in the lint tray than usual
Excessive odor from dryer sheets

, During regular cleaning, sweep up any lint or debris found around the floor of your dryer. Your dryer vent will suck up dirt and debris from the floor, which can get the vent dirty faster. Regular sweeping helps maintain a clean dryer vent., Dryer sheets can make your clothes smell fresher, but can also contribute to built up lint in a dryer vent. In general, opt against dryer lints when possible. Fabric softener should also only be used in moderation, as debris from fabric softening can clog a dryer's vent., Do dry cycles in 30 to 40 minute intervals. This allows for better air circulation. Poor air circulation can cause the build up of dirt and debris in the dryer vent.

 Oxidizing bleaches are less severe than the chlorine versions, and as such are kinder to fabric. Hydrogen peroxide is a commonly used example of an oxidizing bleach which is often used to tackle stains. Chlorine bleaches are much stronger, more toxic, and should be used with care.Chlorine bleaches will damage colour on fabrics, but for white fabrics that is less of a problem.
If you use bleach regularly in your machine washes you may find some yellowish marks appear on white clothes., If you have a really tough to shift stain on something white, the careful application of bleach can help. After a quick spot test, gently dab some bleach onto the reverse side of the affected area of the garment with a cotton swab.Then rest the fabric face down on some kitchen towel.Don’t push down on the fabric or rub against it.









After treating the stain with bleach, wash it as normal.
Wear rubber gloves if you are using bleach like this.
 Always be sure to read the label to see how much it is recommended for you to add to a washing load. As well as checking the label of the bleach, check the label of any garments you are washing to see if it acceptable to use bleach to clean them, for example you mustn’t use bleach with silk or wool.

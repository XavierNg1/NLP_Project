 You shouldn’t start dating a girl just because you want to be part of a couple. That can make you desperate, which means you may wind up scaring her off by being too clingy and possessive. You should be happy on your own before you start dating someone new.You should have your own hobbies, interests, and friends that you really enjoy even without a romantic relationship in your life. If you aren’t happy with those things, work on them before looking to date a girl.;
, If there are issues in your life that you wish would go away, such as insecurities or anxiety, you can’t expect that the girl who you date will magically make them go away. A girlfriend shouldn’t be responsible for sorting out your problems -- you’ll either attract someone who has a savior complex or she’ll wind up resenting you, and in both cases, your relationship probably won’t work out.If you aren’t able to deal with the problems that you’re facing on your own, you may want to talk to a therapist or counselor, who can assist you in finding healthy ways to work through your issues before you start dating.
 Sometimes when you’re looking to attract a girl, you may be tempted to portray yourself as someone other than who you really are to appeal to her interests. For example, if she tells you that she loves tennis, you might lie and say that you were a tennis star in school even though you’ve never picked up a racket. That’s a big mistake because she should like you for who you really are and you won’t be comfortable faking it. Have enough confidence to be yourself.Being yourself doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be open to new experiences. If she has a hobby or interest that she’d like to share with you, be willing to learn more about it -- and share your interests with her as well.

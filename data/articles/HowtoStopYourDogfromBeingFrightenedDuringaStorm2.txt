 If you can minimize the amount of the storm that the dog experiences, it may reduce the dog's discomfort. Close curtains, especially if you have blackout curtains, and move the dog to a room in your home where you can hear the thunder the least.


Doing this in combination with distracting the dog with its favorite toy or game can really alleviate a dog's fear response.
 For example, if your dog is afraid of lightening, try turning on a light in the room your dog is in. This will minimize the impact of the lightening.


Turn on music, or some other kind of noise, to drown out the noise of the thunder. If your dog can't hear it very well, the dog is likely to be less fearful.
 This may be its crate or under the covers in your bed. Dogs naturally look for a den to hide in, so give it that space.If your dog goes into its crate, consider covering it with a blanket to muffle the sounds of the storm further.
Make sure that your dog can get into its den area without your assistance. This will allow it this comfort whether or not you are home.
 There are several products on the market that are basically coats to put on your dog. These coats put gentle pressure on the dog's body, which calms it immensely.Calming body wraps are sold in most pet stores and online. When you are purchasing one, be sure to get the correct size for your dog.
 It may sound weird, but many dogs dislike lightning because it causes static in their fur. Rubbing your dog down with a dryer sheet will help make the uncomfortable sensations go away. It may even help the dog get back to sleep if it wakes up due to the storm.


Do not let the dog chew dryer sheets. Once you rub it on your dog's coat, put it out of reach of the dog. It can make a dog very sick.

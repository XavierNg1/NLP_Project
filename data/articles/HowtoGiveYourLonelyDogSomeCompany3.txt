 Teaching your dog something new will allow you to give your dog company when it’s lonely. If it’s been a while since your dog has learned some tricks, now would be a perfect time to teach it something new. Ideas for tricks are:


Playing dead
Giving you its paw
Rolling over

, If your dog is lonely, taking it to a new area can be just what it needs to perk up and enjoy its time with you. For example, if there’s a dog park you’ve never been to, take your dog there.


Go to music or art festivals that allow dogs. Keep your dog on a leash at the festivals.
 Giving your lonely dog some company doesn’t require a lot of physical activity. Consider just sitting quietly with your dog and petting it. Your touch could be all your dog needs to not feel so lonely.


Your dog may just want to be close to you. Consider sitting down beside your dog and reading a book.

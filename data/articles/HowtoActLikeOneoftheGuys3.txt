Whether you’re playing a pool tournament with the guys or seeing who can hit a tree with a rock, always give it your best effort.
It’s not about winning. Your goal should be to perform to the best of your ability.
 Don’t try to impress the group by pretending to be someone else. They’ll eventually see through your facade. Be confident enough to share your unique personality.


Sincerely learn to connect with your new friends.
 Show the guys you can let go of your worries and enjoy hanging out with them.If you’re focused on the things that bother you, people will pick up on it. Focus on having a good time.


You can confide in your guy friends if something really is bringing you down, but be sure to do it at the right place and time. Wait until you're alone with the guys in a private setting like one their homes. Don't try to tell them you're problems at a party or any other social event.
 Guys don’t like girls who are too judgemental. Don’t focus on what you don’t like about people or how you disagree with their lifestyle. If you judge other people, the guys will know you’ll judge them. Everyone has their own personal values, and if you impose yours on other people, you’ll kill everyone’s buzz.


Be cool to everyone. Don’t act like you’re better than people.
If you like one of the boys, show him that you’d be a fun, accepting girlfriend.
If someone makes you feel threatened, follow your instinct and get away from them.

 The default OS X browser is Safari, but OS X supports a wide array of browsers including Google Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.


If this is your first time opening your preferred browser on your computer, the browser will likely to see if it is the default; when it finds that it isn't, it may prompt you to make it the default browser. Confirming that you would like it to be the default will often take care of the process.
 Depending on which browser you're using, this process will vary:


Chrome - Click the three horizontal lines in the top right corner of your screen, click "Settings", and click the "Make Google Chrome my default browser" option at the bottom of the screen.Firefox - Click the three horizontal lines in the top right corner of your screen, click "Options", select the "General" tab, and click "Make Default".
Opera - Click the "Menu" button in the top left corner of your screen, click "Settings", click the "Browser" option, and click "Make Opera my default browser" under the "Default browser" heading.
For other browsers, look for the "default browser" setting in the pertinent "Settings" menu.
 Any links or app extensions should now open in your new default browser.

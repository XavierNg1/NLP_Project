 If you can't Log in, then get a account in Quizlet first.;
,, This will help you find classes to join.
 Find the one you want to join. You may have a class already for you, if you are joining as recommended by your teacher.
 This will be on the left hand corner of the screen.
 The class will have to allow you to join, so you will have to wait for a while and they may not allow you.You can cancel your request if you want to or if you clicked on the wrong class. You may have to join another class, but you can always create your own class and ask your friends to join.
 Once you joined a class, you can submit sets to your class and even before getting into the class you can discuss on other sets.
 Submit sets, play them and use class sets, because now you are a part of a class.

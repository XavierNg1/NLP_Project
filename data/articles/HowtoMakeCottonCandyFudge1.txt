 Lay two pieces of parchment paper crosswise in a 9 by 9-inch (22.86 by 22.86-centimeter) baking pan so that the bottom and sides are covered. Leave some of the parchment paper hanging over the edges so that you can lift the fudge out later.
 Use pink candy melts if you want pink fudge, and light blue candy melts if you want blue fudge. You can buy candy melts in the baking section of an arts and crafts store, in baking supply shops, and online.

If you can't find any pink or blue candy melts, you can use plain white ones instead. If you still want your fudge to be colored, you will have to add in some food coloring later on.
 Put the bowl into the microwave, and cook for 1Â½ minutes on high.Keep an eye on the bowl, and don't let the candy melts burn., Take the bowl out of the microwave using a pot holder. Set the bowl down on a heat-safe surface. Stir the condensed milk and candy melts together with a whisk.

If the candy is still not melted, even after stirring it, microwave it at 15-second increments until it is melted. Be sure to stir between each increment.
 You can usually find it with the other candy-making supplies in craft shops and baking supply shops. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often.

If you used plain white candy melts, add a few drops of pink or blue gel-based food coloring.
 Use a rubber spatula to scrape everything out of the bowl. Spread the mixture evenly across the bottom of the pan., Place the baking pan in the refrigerator. Leave it there until the fudge sets. It will take about four hours., Once the fudge has set and turned solid, take the baking pan out of the fridge. Set it down on the counter, and use the overhanging parchment paper to lift the fudge out. Use a sharp knife to cut the fudge into 1-inch (2.5-centimeter) squares.

 Any sort of frustration (physical or otherwise) can be alleviated by physical exertion. Sports like kickboxing or martial arts are especially effective. It'll fill your time, take your mind to another place, and get your adrenaline pumping which is a healthy alternative.


Any exercise is good, even yoga, weight training, and standard cardio. Not only is it good for you mentally, but physically to boot.
 If you're not much of a sports or fitness freak, find more artistic hobbies for an outlet. These activities can be incredibly cathartic and calming; what's more, a reduction in anxiety may reduce your frustration. The less stressed you are about the rest of your life, the calmer you'll be about this.


Consider painting, cooking, at-home DIY projects, candle or pottery making, taking up an instrument, carpentry, woodworking, or any hobby at all that appeals to and gets you in the zone. You'll be cultivating a talent, too!

, With todayâ€™s technology, long-distance relationships have never been easier. If you're sexually frustrated because your love is far away, use Skype, Facetime, or just sext. It's not the same, but it can certainly help!


Some people are a little wary of the idea of phone sex or something similar. This may be something you have to ease in slowly with your partner. Start with small steps telling you how much you miss them and how you want to touch them and watch it flower from there.

 What happens if you break up? If you have divulged private information to them, particularly that is work related, consider how this might be used against you in the future. Though your partner may be loving and amazing, know that breakups can bring out the worst in people and could potentially threaten your job.Donâ€™t tell them anything that could damage your career.
 When you two are together away from work, as much as possible, avoid talk about business. Work to keep your professional and romantic lives as separate as possible. This will prevent your life from being solely about work and will help you have a better time with your partner., Since your professional and romantic life is now so heavily intertwined, it will be important to maintain those friendships and hobbies that are completely separate from both. Keep up with your friends and spend time with them regularly. Enjoy your own hobbies apart from the relationship.Continue to read, dance, ride horses or do whatever else you enjoy, as well.

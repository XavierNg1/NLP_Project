 If you try cleaning Saffiano purses or business bags while they have things in them, the shifting contents could make it difficult to apply the cleaning agent of your choice. To avoid this, remove everything from your bag and lay it flat on a table or other flat surface before cleaning., If you’re not using your bag, put some rolled up old t-shirts or even bunched-up newspapers inside the bag so it doesn’t collapse on itself. If the Saffiano leather sits unused for too long, the lines which develop when it settles might become difficult or impossible to work out., A dust bag should have come with your purse or business bag when you purchased it. The dust bag is the case in which you should store your bag when you’re not using it regularly. This way, it will be protected from collecting dust and dirt, or getting anything yucky spilled on it. Place your Saffiano leather purse in its dust bag then store it in the closet or beneath your bed.If you lost or didn’t get a dust bag, just store it in an empty pillowcase and roll the case up at the end before stashing it somewhere safe.

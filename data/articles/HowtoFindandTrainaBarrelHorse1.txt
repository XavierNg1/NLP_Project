 Don't look for barrel horse breeders, as they probably won't be in your area and will probably be too expensive. Go to your local tack shop, 4-h club, or ask your instructor if they have any suggestions on where to look.;
, If you don't have time to commit to the responsibilities of owning a horse, ask your instructor if you can lease one of his/her horses, or look locally for a horse for lease.
 Once you have found a horse that appears to have athletic ability, take a hard look at his confirmation. Some rules of the thumb are: the hind legs should appear larger than the front end, the top line should be shorter than the underline, the cannon bones should be shorter than the forearm/gaskin, and the stifle should be wider than the hip.
 Walk it first, then trot, then lope. If the horse bucks when he turns the barrel, don't buy. If the horse tries taking off to run the pattern full speed, don't buy. You want a horse with little to no experience on the pattern, but is still willing to do it and to listen to your speed request. If all goes well, proceed with a vet check. If the horse passes as sound, buy the horse. If he is lame, don't buy.

 You can leave specific ones if you know who will find them, but you can also just write little messages such as "I love you" or "You brighten my day!", Even if it's not a special occasion, give someone a card. Tell that person why you're glad he or she is in your life.


For instance, you could write something simple such as "Dear Grace, I just wanted to write you a note to say how much you mean to me. I'm so glad I met you, and we get to be friends! You brighten up my days! Love, Lisa."

, It's easy to do if you're packing it, but you can also slip it in later. Just say something nice to give that person a boost. You can even write it on a napkin., Leave a note for loved ones by writing on the mirror or the shower wall. They'll find it the next time they hop in the shower.

 Getting ready for the party by planning in advance will greatly reduce your anxiety about the party.You will have time to make sure you have everything you want and need to make the party a success without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.


Make a list of the things you have to get and do to get ready for the holiday party.
Include plans for food, location, decorations, guests, music, and entertainment.
Remember to include your budget in the plan so that you’ll know how much money you have to spend on everything.
 Don’t overwhelm yourself by trying to do everything on your own. Instead, ask your family and friends to help you with the party. Getting the people around you to help with the party can help you cope with your anxiety by giving you less to do and more support.


For example, you can ask your best friend to go and buy the decorations or ask your mom to help with the menu.
Consider making the event a potluck or even having it catered so you don’t have to worry about cooking.
Ask your brother to help with clean-up after the party is over or ask your sister to help you take decorations down.
 Taking some time to yourself to just relax and take care of yourself will help you cope with anxiety of planning a holiday party. Do something that makes you smile, to take your mind off of the holidays and ease the tension.Treat yourself to a bath, a relaxing evening with a book, or a date with your partner (if you have one).
Relax and listen to music for a few minutes. Don't do anything else. Just do that.
Sit in a quiet place. Put aside all your thoughts and worries and just concentrate on relaxing.

 When you wink at someone, you only communicate something if they see you winking. So, before you do anything else, make eye contact with the person you plan to wink at.;
, Some people find it easier to wink with one eye than the other, while others can wink equally well with both.


Try each eye separately when no one is around in order determine which is easier for you.You may find that trying to wink with one eye will cause your face to "scrunch" more than the other. Or it may be that when winking with one of your eyes, you find it harder to control the other, making your wink look more like a blink.
 Lower the eyelid of the chosen eye while keeping the other eye open. When you are first starting out, you may have to concentrate pretty hard to make this work.
 Especially when you are first learning to wink, you may need to raise your cheek slightly to achieve full closure of the eye.


With practice over time, you should find you have to do this less and less.
 Try hard not to squint with the eye you are keeping open. The effort of keeping this eye open sometimes results in squinting for the beginning winker.When you first start out, this squinting will be hard to control. Again, with practice, you'll find you are doing this less and less.
 Once you've fully closed the winking eye, open it back up again. That's it!

, When you are first learning to wink, you'll probably find it helpful to practice alone in a mirror. Make eye contact with yourself and practice your winks.With enough practice, this will start to look and feel natural.
 When you think you've got it down, ask a friend to have a look at your winking. He or she can tell you whether it looks good or if you are still squinting or otherwise making it look like an effort.

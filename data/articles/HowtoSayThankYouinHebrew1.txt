 In Hebrew, the simplest, most common way to say "thank you" is "toda" (תודה).The first syllable is very similar to the English word "TOffee."


Try to pronounce it with the tongue and lips at the front of the mouth to give it a very slight "oo" sound. You don't want to say "too," but the word shouldn't quite use a straight "oh" either.;
, The second syllable in "toda" uses a standard English d Some Hebrew speakers pronounce it with a short a sound (like the a in "apple").Try to open your mouth slightly when you pronounce this syllable. Say it with the middle or back of your mouth (not with your lips at the front) to get the perfect inflection.
 "Toda" is pronounced basically "toh-DAH," with the emphasis on the second syllable. A good example of the proper pronunciation and stress is available from Omniglot.This is important — putting the stress on the first syllable ("TOH-dah") will make the word sound bizarre and may make it hard to understand you. It's like pronouncing the English word "enough" as "EE-nuff," not "ee-NUFF."

, In Hebrew, "toda" is very, very common. You can use it to give thanks in virtually any situation. For instance, it's a good choice when you are served food, when someone gives you a compliment, or when someone gives you a helping hand.


One of the nice things about the Hebrew language is that it doesn't have strict rules about which words to use in formal situations and which to use in informal ones (like, for instance, Spanish). You can say "toda" to your little brother or to the CEO of the company you're working for — it doesn't matter!

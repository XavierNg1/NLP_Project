 You can find them for under $20 at the Goodwill or at thrift shops. If you don't think your dress is puffy enough (i.e. it can fit through the door), buy a bridal crinoline while you're at the thrift shop. I bought one for about $10. You can also search eBay or other online shops for dresses and crinolines.;
, Head to Walmart and into the craft section. There you can buy bows, ribbons, lace, beads, pearls, rhinestones, and the like in coordinating colors to your dress. If your dress has no sleeves, you will also want to buy fabric for sleeves.
 Sew the sleeves and leave the end that will be on your shoulder and armpit with a raw edge. Sew that to the dress in a way that you find attractive. Then, put the dress on. Right above the elbow, bunch the sleeve up so that it is skinny on the top and poofs out on the bottom. Sew it in place. You can sew a ribbon around the bunched part too.
 If you need inspiration, look for Marie Antoinette photo gallery on Google. Bows and lace were frequently used to adorn dresses, as well as pearls and diamonds.
 However, you still have a ways to go - after all, what was Marie Antoinette famous for? Her hair! You could buy a wig, but if you plan on doing your hair yourself, you should begin practicing early. In order to achieve Marie Antoinette hair, you need a filler - I used a ball of yarn. You place the filler on your head, pin it in place, and pin your hair over it to cover it. When you're done achieving tall hair, decorate it similarly to the way you decorated the dress. Rosettes, pearls, roses, etc.
 Fairly simple, really, you will just need an average makeup kit for that, so nothing to worry about.

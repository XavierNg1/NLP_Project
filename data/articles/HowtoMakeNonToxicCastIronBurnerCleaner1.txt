 Before you act, determine how you should best approach the situation. In most cases you will want to remove excess build up before getting down to the actual cleaning and polishing part.

Run your fingernail along the top of the burner to see if you can easily pull up debris. If so, take a soft, dry cloth and chip away at the grease/food coating.

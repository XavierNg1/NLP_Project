 This app has a grey camera icon and is located on the Home Screen.
 This will set the focus point of the image and will reveal the exposure control represented by a sun icon on the right side of the focus box.
 The photo will grow darker when you slide down and lighter when sliding up.


The iPhone may automatically try to adjust the exposure if you move the camera around. Try framing your photo before manually adjusting the exposure.
 The new image will be saved to your iPhone's hard drive with the desired exposure.

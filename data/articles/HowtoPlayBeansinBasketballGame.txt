 Each player will be picking one spot that they will be shooting from the whole game. Make sure it's behind the 3-point line!;
, Everyone will be shooting in order from left to right (or vice versa).
 Then the next person shoots. Consecutive makes by everyone can make the pot HUGE. If a player misses their shot, they will receive however much beans are in the "pot".
 They can be used as rebounders.
 The last man standing wins!

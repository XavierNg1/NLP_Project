 This can be done by simply searching up the type of model, and finding it's dimensions. For example, if you're making an Airbus A380 plane model, you would search up the dimensions of the plane, as this is the first step to finding the plane's scale.
 It doesn't need to be millimeter perfect, but use a ruler for fairly accurate results., So, say the real life object had a length of 55m, and the model had a length of 50 cm, or 0.5m, then do 55/0.5.Â This is equal to 110., So, after your division of 55/0.5, the answer is 110.

Taking the reciprocal basically means putting 1 over it as a fraction. So, the reciprocal is 1/110. Now, instead of this being a fraction, just make it into a ratio, so, it is not 1/110 but 1:110.
 You now know that in this example, 110 of your scale model will make 1 of the real life model.

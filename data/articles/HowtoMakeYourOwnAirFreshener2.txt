2 tablespoons vodka, rubbing alcohol, or witch hazel
Â¾ cup (180 milliliters) distilled water
15 to 20 drops essential oil blend

 You can use all one small, or experiment with different combinations. Here are a few ideas to get you started:To make a calming scent, use the following essential oils: 10 drops lavender and 5 to 8 drops chamomile.
To make an energizing scent, use the following essential oils: 5 drops wild orange, 5 drops lemon, 5 drops lime, and 5 drops grapefruit.
To made a fresh-smelling spray, use the following essential oils: 5 drops lavender, 5 drops lemon, and 5 drops rosemary.

 The vodka, rubbing alcohol, or witch hazel will help dissolve the oil and make it easier to blend with the water. They will also help preserve your spray.
 You might end up using a little bit less water, depending on the shape of your bottle and how much essential oil you used.
 Whenever you want to freshen up your room, shake the bottle and give the room three to four squirts. The oils will naturally separate over time, so you will need to shake the bottle each time before you use it.

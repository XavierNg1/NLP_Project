 You don't want to leave anyone on the team open. Point and yell "I've got 33" for example.;
, You don't have to overdo it, just keep your knees bend and be ready to move if the person you're defending tries to run away. As long as you aren't too low you'll be faster than him every time.
 If the person you're guarding has the ball, keep one hand above the ball and one hand on the side. Your hands don't need to touch the ball, or even be right next to it. Just keep them near it. If he goes right, keep your left hand on the side, and right hand above. Reverse this if he goes left.


Let's say your man puts the ball above his head. This is what we call the "Dork Position". To get the ball away from him, put your hand on your his stomach, so he has no way to bring it down. Then, reach up and slap the ball out of his hands. Sprint after it, and grab it. Easy turnover.
If your man tries to drive, you can stop him by 'bumping the drive'. You do this by put most of your weight on the foot opposite of the way your man is trying to drive. Then push off, hard. you will end up in the path of your man. Now, put your chest out and bump him. Not to hard,but hard enough to displace him.
 While he can fake moves with nearly every other part of his body, he can't fake with his belly button.



If he is close to the basket, shoots, and misses, box-Out. Boxing out is when you're in front of someone while you're trying to get the rebound and pushing your rear end out so he can't get it.

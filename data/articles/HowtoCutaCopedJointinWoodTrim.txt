 Cut the first piece of baseboard square and nail it in place. Cut the second piece to length. One end will be coped to fit over the first piece you cut. The other end will either be left square if it ends at an inside corner or left long and cut to fit if it's an outside corner.;
, Bevel the end of the molding to be coped at a 45-degree angle with a miter saw. This will reveal the profile. Darken the edge of the profile with a pencil so it will stand out more when you cut it.
 Angle the coping saw about 30 degrees to remove more wood from the back of the molding than the front. Then slowly and carefully saw along the profile. Concentrate on staying just outside the line. You can always sand or file away extra material.
 Check the fit of the coped piece. Mark any high spots.
 File or sand off high spots. Use rolled-up sandpaper or a rat tail file to fine-tune curved sections. File and sand until the joint fits tightly.
 Cope one end and leaving the other end square.

Second, you have to memorize it when first you learn it, such as la notte (the night), which is femminile.

Always learn Italian words with their articles (and hence their gender) as part of the vocabulary. In English you do not have to do this since there is no difference in gender of the articles; the man or the woman.
Not that trying to make the road so difficult for you, but if you are really adamant to learn a foreign language it is better to learn the vocabulary with division of each word into its syllables.
And knowing which syllable is stressed.
This will be achieved by constant referring to a good quality dictionary of that language.




il mio fidanzato (my boyfriend).

la mia fidanzata (my girlfriend).

Note this. Gentile (/dʒεn-ti-le/) means delicate. Then il gentil sesso figuratively means le donne; that is, the plural of women, while the phrase is a masculine clause.
Owner of speech is not important. A girl says, "il mio fidanzato."
Object of the speech is not important too. A man says, "il mio amore" since l'amore (love by itself) is maschile (masculine).


Adjective agrees with the gender of the modified noun (and comes after the noun, in contrast to English). Hence,

il fiore rosso (red flower - flower masculine).
la penna rossa (red pen - pen feminine).
le carte rosse (red papers - papers plural feminine).


Adjective uses masculine form when it modifies both masculine and feminine. Hence,


il fiore e la penna sono rossi.

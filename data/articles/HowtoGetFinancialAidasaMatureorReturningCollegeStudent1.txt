 You apply once per Academic Year -- as soon as possible after Jan. 1 each year before the upcoming Academic Year, but you can apply at anytime during the academic year, as long as you're still enrolled in school.


This Federal student aid usually consists of grants (free money which doesn't need to be paid back) and loans (borrowed money that does need to be paid back when done with school, but at very reasonable interest rates and repayment terms), which are the largest sources of student aid.;
, In a few days you will have access (at the same web site) to your Student Aid Report (SAR) which is what you get after the FAFSA is processed.  Double-check the SAR for any data entry errors and make corrections online if necessary.  Also make sure that the school or college you plan to attend is listed as one of the schools on your SAR.
 Make contact with the Financial Aid Office once you know for sure which school you are attending to see if there is anything else you need to do or submit to get your aid file processed at that school.

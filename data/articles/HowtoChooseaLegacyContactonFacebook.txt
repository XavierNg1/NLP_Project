 A legacy contact is about choosing someone who can manage some basic aspects of your account in order to properly memorialize it and ensure that those viewing it are able to be responded to adequately. The legacy feature will allow your chosen person to:


Write a post that sits at the top of the memorialized Timeline. This could be a special message that reflects the family's feelings or it might give details of a memorial service, wake, and so forth.
Reply to any new friend requests made to your Facebook account made by family and friends who did not have a Facebook connection with you prior to your death. Some people may feel this is the only way to reach your family or to leave messages of condolence with the family.
Make changes to your profile picture and cover photo.
If you have granted permission, the legacy contact will also be able to download an archive of the photos, posts and profile information that you've shared on Facebook.


Be aware that a legacy contact cannot log in as you or see your private messages.

, (requires the completion of Eadgar's Ruse, you also need 61 magic.) you also need to have killed dad in troll stronghold if you cannot teleport to Trollheim, or to even have access to godwars dungeon. you also need either 60 strength or 60 agility.
 Rope is only needed on the first time.
 Zamorak, Saradomin, Bandos, or Armadyl. for rookies Zamorak or bandos would be the best option (requires 70 Hit points). bandos requires 70 strength and a hammer.
 there are also a good amount of bandos minions there if you choose to kill bandos instead. when you get into the dungeon, do not run south unless you have an armadyl item or you will take heavy damage from the aviansies. all you'll really need is an item from saradomin, zamorak or bandos to get the kill count safely. (note, there are aviansies scattered around the dungeon, but most of them are near the entrance to Armadyl's Eyrie. if you encounter one, just either turn on protection from ranged and run/ kill it. they must be attacked with ranged or mage.)

,, your prayer will drop to 0. if you're killing bandos, bang the gong on the bandos stronghold, requires 70 str and a hammer. there are altars in the boss rooms, but you can only use it every 10 mins. that is where the pots and/or super restores come in. (note: saradomin brews do heal you, but they also lower your stats but they give you extra hp. an alternative to sara brews is to use rocktail. rocktail will increase your hp without doing stat damage.)

, if you're fighting bandos, 1 person gets meleed and the rest of the people use protection from ranged.
, If you can go on, do not teleport or you will lose kill count

 Ask the financial aid office which grants are available for women, returning students and students in your curriculum.


You may need to submit an application to attend the school prior to applying for grants at the school.
 This office may have additional info about what companies and organizations give grants to help returning students in the area.
 There are usually deadlines for submission several months in advance of the start of the semester.
 These schools are well-known for helping non-traditional students and may have more women and returning student grants than larger universities.


For example, schools like the East Lansing Community College have grants for women, special populations, single parents, non-traditional careers and displaced homemakers.
 Many states have special foundations or state agencies that support adult students. Call your state's Department of Education.


Try the following organizations, if you live in the state in which they are based: California's Capture the Dream, Arizona Private Post-Secondary Education Student Financial Assistance Grant, Kansas Board of Regents, Central Alabama Community Foundation, Michigan Tuition Grant, College for All Texans, New York Higher Education Services Foundation and the Delaware Governor's Education Grant for Unemployed Adults.

 Chalking is a soft coloring technique involving a chalk palette, a dazzle sticker and a Q-tip. To try chalking, take a dazzle sticker and stick it on the greeting card. Dip the Q-tip into your color of choice on the chalk palette, then use the Q-tip to lightly color in the dazzle sticker.A dazzle sticker is a raised sticker you can use to create an embossed effect.
Chalk palettes and dazzle stickers can be purchased at specialty arts and craft stores.
You can also just stick the dazzle sticker on your card without coloring it in.
 Inking is a technique used to make the edges of a greeting card more defined. Take an ink pad and gently run it around the perimeter of the card. This should darken the edges of the greeting card.For a more distressed look, let the ink spill over onto the front of the card.
For tricky edges, use a Q-tip to spread the ink on the card.
Ink pads can be purchased at office supply stores and craft stores.
 Brads are paper fasteners that come in both circles or other decorative shapes. To use a brad on your greeting card, make a small hole in your card using a needle or pin. Stick the prongs of the brad through the hole, then spread the prongs to attach the brad to the card.Apply pressure on the legs of the brad to fold them into place.
Brads can be purchased in specialty craft stores.

 There are numerous designs of electro-surgical units, and facilities should base their comparisons among devices according to characteristics, usefulness of features, safety, and reliability - all of these affect clinical performance.
 Their typical frequency range is from 0.3 to 1 MHz. They should also include the following:

Isolated monopolar output.
Hand switch.
Footswitch.
Bipolar output.


For monopolar cutting output power should not exceed 300 W, and the open circuit voltage should not exceed 2,000 peak-to-peak volts.
For coagulation cutting, the output and open circuit voltage should not exceed 120 W and 6,000 peak-to peak volts, respectively.
Bipolar mode should use no more than 50 W and 300 peak-to-peak volts.

Independent output visual and audible activation indicators.
Alarm capable of volumes higher than 45 dB at one meter.
Power-setting display.
Convection or fan cooling system.
 The device should include an alarm capable of volumes higher than 45 dB at one meter.,

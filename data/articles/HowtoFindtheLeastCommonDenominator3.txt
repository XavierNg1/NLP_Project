 Factor each denominator digit into a series of prime numbers that multiply together to make that number. Prime numbers are numbers that cannot be divided by any other number. Example: 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/12

Prime factorization of 4: 2 * 2

Prime factorization of 5: 5

Prime factorization of 12: 2 * 2 * 3

, Tally up the number of times that each prime number appears in the factorization of each denominator digit.


Example: There are two 2’s in 4; zero 2’s in 5; two 2’s in 12
There are zero 3’s in 4 and 5; one 3 in 12
There are zero 5’s in 4 and 12; one 5 in 5

, Identify the largest number of times you used each prime number for any of the denominators and note that count.


Example: The largest count of 2 is two; the largest of 3 is one; the largest of 5 is one

, Do not write out the number of times each prime number appeared throughout all the original denominators. Only write out the largest count, as determined in the previous step.


Example: 2, 2, 3, 5

, Multiply the prime numbers together as they appeared in the previous step. The product of these numbers equals the LCD for the original equation.


Example: 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 = 60
LCD = 60


, To determine the multiple needed to make the denominators equal, divide the LCD you determined by the original denominator. Multiply the numerator and the denominator of each fraction by this number. The denominators should now both be equal to the LCD.


Example: 60/4 = 15; 60/5 = 12; 60/12 = 5
15 * (1/4) = 15/60; 12 * (1/5) = 12/60; 5 * (1/12) = 5/60
15/60 + 12/60 + 5/60

, With the LCD found, you should be able to add and subtract the fractions as usual. Remember to simplify the fraction at the end, if possible.


Example: 15/60 + 12/60 + 5/60 = 32/60 = 8/15

 Making decisions about what college you will attend, what your major will be, and what classes you plan to take can be overwhelming. Find someone who is not judgmental and is a good listener. A friend, family member, or teacher can serve as a sounding board to help you work through your thoughts, ideas, and problems.Try talking to someone who has also gone through similar stress. They will be able to empathize and offer advice that stems from personal experience.
 Choosing a career path can be stressful, and judgmental, negative people can make the situation worse. Try avoiding people who make judgments about your proposed college, major, or career choice. You should also stay away from people who are negative.For example, if your grandmother is constantly pressuring to attend her alma mater while talking negatively about the school you really want to attend, you should try to limit conversations with her about your college choice.
 It is important that you take care of yourself while preparing for college. Pay attention to what you eat, and make sure you are properly nourished. You should also make sure to get at least eight hours of sleep each night. Regular exercise should also be a part of your life.Take time for a relaxing activity each week like walking on a local trail, taking a long bath, or reading a novel.

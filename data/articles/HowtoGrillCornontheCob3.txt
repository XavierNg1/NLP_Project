 Corn grilled without a wrapper will never be as juicy as the other options, and there's a risk of charring it into oblivion. When done correctly, however, the kernels will pick up plenty of flavor from the grill, caramelizing into smoky sweetness.


This is also the fastest method of grilling corn.
 A medium temperature is the best option for your first attempt. Once you've got a feel for how the corn should end up, you can fire it up to very high heat for a quicker grill.
 Strip away the husks and silk. The silk will burn off on the grill, so you don't need to get every strand., Place the corn on an upper rack if you have one, to prevent charring. Keep a close eye on the corn, turning occasionally. The kernels will brighten in color, then turn brown as they caramelize. The corn is ready when there are many light brown spots, but most of the corn is still yellow.

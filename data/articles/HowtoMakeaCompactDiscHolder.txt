, If you're making a CD holder for a Mini-CD, then you'll want the measurements to be approximately 3½" x 3½" (8.89cm x 8.89cm).









If you'd like your styrofoam to be be colorful or patterned, decorate it with markers or paint at this stage. Allow to dry before moving to the next steps.
 Ensure that there is a little bit of room to spare to make it easier to slide the CD's on.









If the CD's fit, then move onto the next step.
If the CD's don't fit, use only one pencil and mentally convert all the 'two pencils' later in the steps, to 'one pencil'. Also, skip step 4 (see below).
 You won't want them to be able to move too much.
, Enjoy!

 Think about what kinds of "dinosaurs" you can have. For example, you could make a "pigosaurus rex" by making a nice, big cage and putting pigs in there, then listing interesting facts about the "dinosaur".;
, If you don't want to make animal-dinos, you can easily build a statue of a dinosaur, or you can do both. You could do something like build a "Dirtosaur" and a "Cobbledon", out of simply dirt and cobblestone. With all the blocks in the game, you can make any type of dinosaur you want!

, Make it like a zoo. Have big, wide open enclosures. For any flying dinosaurs, make sure their enclosures have roofs.
 You can either build the park on a server or take screenshots and post them on the Internet.

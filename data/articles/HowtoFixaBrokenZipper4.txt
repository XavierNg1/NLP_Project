 The bottom stop is the piece that the slider will rest against when it travels all the way down the teeth to the bottom of the zipper. To deal with missing bottom teeth, you’ll have to remove the old bottom stop.









Hold the garment firmly and pull the stops off.
In some cases, you may need pliers to help you gain more leverage pulling the stop off., The tack is a piece that keeps the parts of the zipper secure to the garment. By removing the tack, you’ll be able to fully access the teeth. This is important, as you’ll need to fix all your zipper’s teeth before your zipper will work correctly.









Flip the garment inside out and locate the tack at the bottom of the placket layers of the item (this will be on the inside flap covering the zipper).
Remove the tack with a seam ripper., By inserting a new and larger bottom stop, you’ll be able to cover missing teeth. Thus, your zipper will function normally and won’t get stuck or snagged in the future.









Bottom zipper stops are measured in millimeters. Determine the size you will need by measuring the width of the closed zipper.
Turn the garment right side out.
Push the prongs of the bottom zipper stop into the fabric directly above the old zipper stop—the new zipper stop will cover the missing bottom teeth.
Turn the garment inside out and check if the stop is perpendicular to the zipper.
Close the prongs with a pair of pliers to secure it in place., Once you’ve attached a new stop, you’ll need to re-tack the bottom portion of the zipper so it holds together with the garment. This is somewhat easy to do.









Turn your garment right side out.
Use a sewing machine or a needle and thread to replace the tack you removed.

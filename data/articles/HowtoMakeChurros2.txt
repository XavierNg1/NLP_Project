 The dough in a "real" churro is a little different than the dough in a biscuit, but the basic ingredients are the same and they will cook similarly. It is usually best to use the smaller biscuits, allowing you to more easily fry everything.

If you don't want the fat of biscuit batter, you can use 1 cup hot water and 3-1/4 cups of your favorite all-purpose pancake mix. Blend into a dough and proceed like normal., Churros need to be long and thin in order to really cook nicely. Try to make all the ropes roughly the same diameter for the best results.
 Simply make a rope out of the biscuits by braiding one over the other, When done, pinch both ends together to fuse them. You can also lightly roll the whole thing together to keep the centers together.
 Simply put the dough into a large plastic bag, then snip off the bottom corner with scissors. You can push the dough straight out the bottom of the back in perfect strips.
 Heat until it reached 375F. Make sure there is about 2 inches (5.1Â cm) of oil in the pan to cover the churros. There should be enough oil so that they float freely while frying, and all sides, except the very top, are being cooked at the same time.









If you don't have an oil thermometer, 375 is when there is barely smoke coming off the top of the oil. Don't let it get much farther than this point.
 Fry for about 2 minutes, or until golden brown. They don't take long, but you can easily see when they are finished by the color on the outsides. Once they look good to eat, they usually are.
 Pat them down with paper towels to remove excess oil, which will make them soggy if it cools on the churro.
 In a separate bowl, mix up 1/2 cup of sugar with a teaspoon of cinnamon. Then roll the warm churros in the mixture to coat them deliciously.
 They are fine on their own or with a delicious chocolate dip. Enjoy!

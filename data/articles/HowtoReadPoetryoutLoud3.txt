 Spend some time getting to know the poem. Read it through several times, and try to tease out its meaning. Some poems have clearer meanings than others, so in some cases, you may only be able to figure out a feeling or tone. Either way, you need to have some understanding of the poem before you are able to read it well.To help figure out the poem, break it down into pieces. Try ciphering out what certain similes mean in connection to the whole.
For example, one famous poem by Langston Hughes, "Harlem," is composed of a series of similes. It starts out with "What happens to a dream deferred?" then goes through similes such as "Does it dry up / like a raisin in the sun?" The simile compares a dream deferred to a raisin, losing all life, becoming shriveled under the heat of the sun.
 Read through the poem, and figure out what needs to be loud or soft, what need to be punched or spoken softly. Look at where you need longer pauses for emphasis. Try to mark all of these instance in your poem, then practice reading with the marked-up poem. You can use different colors if that helps., If you don't know the word, you're not going to understand how it fits into the poem. In addition, you want to make sure you get the pronunciation right, as sound is very important to a poem. Mark the words you don't know, and then spend some time with your dictionary., While it's not necessary to memorize a poem to read it out loud, it can help you find a better rhythm if you memorize it. You'll be able to think about the natural flow of the poem, instead of being worried about what's coming next.

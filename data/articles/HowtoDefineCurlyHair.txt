, It is important to use a gentle shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner in the shower. These products will clarify and maintain moisture in the hair.
 Make sure to do so when your hair has a good amount of conditioner in it. For a little added moisture try adding honey to your conditioner, but be sure to rinse most of it out.
 This adds shine and prevents frizz. For a little extra root volume try rinsing upside down.
 At this point, make sure your hair has no tangles left. If it does gently untangle with your fingers and then give your hair another rinse in the sink, making sure to reapply your conditioner. While you can skip a leave in, it's best to use one so your hair stays moisturized, and frizz free throughout the day.
 Make sure this is well distributed on the whole hair. Products like these are key for preventing frizz in high humidity.
 Smooth the product on with your hands, making sure to evenly coat every section. Experiment with products and amounts of products until you get the right combination for your hair.
 Here are two methods, so see which one works best for you.


Scrunching: Cup your hair in your hands and scrunch in an upwards motion. The more you scrunch, the curlier your hair will be.
Twirling: Twist a section around your finger, making sure to go with the natural curl of the section. This method will produce perfect ringlets, and a detailed explanation is included in the video below.
 Generic towels are made of terry cloth, and the little loops that make up the cloth tend to catch on curly hair and cause frizz. Once you have removed as much water as possible, you might want to plop while you apply makeup or put on your clothes.
 Air-drying leads to the least amount of frizz, but if you don't have the time make sure to blow dry with a diffuser attachment.
 Once dry, scrunch out any crunch from your products, and enjoy your frizz free spirals!

 Everybody likes a good story, right? You can read it in bed or even in the middle of the afternoon! You can get a chapter book and read couple chapters a day or you could get a picture book and read it in one day! Your choice! Or let your teddy decide!;
, If you don't play with your teddy, it will feel like you don't like it! Remember to play with it everyday! Sometimes your teddy will not talk to you if you don't play with it for a while!

, Tell your secrets to your teddy bear and maybe it will tell you his/her secrets too! You have to promise not to share the secrets with ANYONE!

, Everyone LOVES movies! Even teddy bears! Go onto On-Demand and pick out a good movie to watch! Then sit down with your teddy on the couch and enjoy!

, You don't have to do this but if you do, your teddy will LOVE it! Make some stylish clothes from felt or buy some from build-a-bear-workshop!

, Give it a goodnight kiss and pull the covers over it so it won't get cold when it's sleeping!

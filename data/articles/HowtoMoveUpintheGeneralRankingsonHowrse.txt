 The more horses, the better. Skilled or 100 blup horses may give you a higher ranking. Regular horses are fine too, you may just need more of them.


The age matters a lot. Older horses are sure to move you up in the rankings.;
, The more seniority you have, the more you will move up in the rankings.
 The number of passes you buy on your account has a big impact. If you buy 1 you'll move up at least three rankings. (Ranking movements are not guaranteed every time a pass is bought though.)

, The number of droppings in your stock is another way but not guaranteed. Not many have had success this way but some have. Never hurts to try this way.

 Doing this allows you to write down just the important information so that when you study for a test, you don't have to read through the entire section of the book again.;
, Teachers tend to ignore students in the back of the classroom because they belong to the "I don't want to be here" group, and pay less attention to those in the front of the classroom because they belong to the "prodigy" group (you barely understand quantum physics? Hah!). Sitting in the middle ensures that you are getting as much attention as possible from the teacher during class.
 Nothing says "I'm serious about learning" like business-casual. Teachers will take you more seriously, and as an added bonus, people give more credit to a person that's well dressed.
 It helps to compile a list of questions so that you can check them off if you understand the concepts later.
 Meet with them to discuss any questions you have. Bring your list of questions from that week.
 Teachers love nothing more than a student who has the initiative to talk to them. It gives them a better idea of where you're having problems, and allows them to say things that they couldn't in the class (Giving shortcuts for problems, deeper conversation about a subject, etc...). The better the relationship with your teacher is, the more help you get from that teacher during the semester.
 It seems like a natural thing to save all of your homework for the weekend, but it's not a good idea, because teachers expect you to do it, and usually save their biggest and longest assignments for the weekend (You have to do SOMETHING during those boring weekends, don't you?).

 Getting warmed up before you start to dance will keep you from straining a muscle or getting injured. Just bend down to touch your toes, roll your neck and shoulders, and stretch your wrists to feel nice and loose. If you can do a backbend, do one to help stretch out your stomach muscles.


As you get ready to belly dance, you should put your hair up and wear a shirt that exposes your belly.
Practice dancing in front of a mirror so you can monitor your movements.;
, Any music with a strong repetitive base will help get you in the right frame of mind. Try to use some music of Middle Eastern origin and gain an understanding of the rhythms. There are many pieces of Arabic music that are composed specifically for belly dance and contain musical cues which will help you to understand when to make earthy movements and when to make flowing, graceful movements. Being able to dance to middle eastern music will help you to gain appreciation for belly dance.
 Begin in a position so that your upper body is straight. Don't arch your back or hunch. Tuck in your butt so that it also aligns with your back. Bend your knees slightly and never, ever, lock them. Your feet should be parallel and about a foot apart. Your chin should be raised slightly, and your shoulders should be bent gently back.
 Use your stomach muscles to 'pull' or lead your hip movement; the lower back should not have a large arch. Some schools insist on the stomach pulling from the start, in order to train your stomach. Lift your arms in the air so that they're slightly above parallel to the ground and lift your wrists slightly.

 Don't be discouraged. While many figure skaters started young, it is always possible learn something you put your willpower and effort into learning. It is important to focus on enjoying the learning first, and setting aside comparisons with the younger crew skating quickly and spinning and jumping with seeming ease. They had to begin somewhere too, and it's all about being dedicated and working towards your goal.


Don't be held back by thinking you have to be better or faster than you are from the start. You will get there, it just takes time and practice.;
, Wear the right clothing and gear. This isn't just about boosting your confidence, it's also a form of ensuring your safety and preventing injury. Things to consider include:


Wear sufficiently warm clothing. Choose trousers, slacks or figure hugging long pants that allow for free movement and provide warmth. Wearing pants will help prevent ice burn and can either prevent or minimize grazing on the ice.

Consider appropriate accessories such as gloves, a hat and leg warmers to help keep you warm.

Are the blades sharp? There is nothing less inviting than going on the ice with blunt blades.

 Ask a friend, family member or someone else you trust to help you learn at the beginning. Alternatively, enroll in a teen or adult class or get a one-on-one coach.

 This skill can help you to overcome fear on the ice. The reason why children learn faster is because they are not afraid to fall and through their numerous times of falling down, they learn. Adults tend to have mental blocks, thoughts about the various ways they are going to fall and injure themselves, and even imagery about broken bones. Perhaps you had even experienced a painful slip. However, the reality is that most falls do not cause serious injuries and are simply part of the learning process. Get trained in falling the right way from the very beginning, so that you can remove this fear quickly. See further How to fall and recover from a fall on ice.

 The more you practice, the faster and more agile you'll become. If you enjoy the sport, it won't be long before you get to performing spins and jumps but you must get someone to teach you these properly.


Figure skating requires strength for the jumps and flexibility for certain movements. You'll need to do physical conditioning and stretches regularly at home. You'll only see results if you do it regularly, preferably 3-4 times a week. Exercises such as sit-ups and planking can help to train your core muscles for a higher jump. Squats can strengthen your thigh muscles for a sit spin. Even if you haven't reach spinning and jumping yet, you could start training now so that you'll be able to master the jumps and spins faster next time.
 Having friends who share the same hobbies as you can help you to learn faster. Not only you can exchange skating tips with them to help each other out, you will also feel less lonely when you are at the rink. This will make your skating experience fun and exciting. Best of all, knowing that your friends are going too will act as a motivation to keep you going!

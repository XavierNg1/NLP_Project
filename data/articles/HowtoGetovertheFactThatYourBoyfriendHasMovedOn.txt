, Go home and take a warm bath in your favorite bubble bath scent. Light some of your favorite candles. Or simply splash some of your favorite perfume on yourself. Try soothing scents such as Jasmine or Vanilla. Also, try cheerful scents, like Sweet Pea or any other floral scent.
 Scope out hotties, or go for makeovers. They bring out your outer and inner beauty and will always be there for you no matter what.
 Sit down and have nice chats at the dinner table with them about your day and their day. Have a game night to bring everyone together. Watch some classic movies or family tapes to get a good laugh out.
 What boyfriend?- Forget about him! He isn't worth your time anymore! Don't talk bad about him, don't even talk about him. You've got your own life and he has his own.
 A complete makeover! Be who you've always wanted to be. Be what you've always wanted to be. Strive for more!

, Need a tune up? Get a tutor. Plan on what college you think you'll want to go to. Where do you want to live? What occupation do you want?

, It's great to have someone special, but you won't die if you don't.

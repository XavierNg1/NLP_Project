 Most cars come equipped with buttons that allow you to recirculate the air already in your car or to pull air in from outside. If your windshield is fogging, change the setting so the air gets pulled into the car from the outside. Look for the button that has a little car with an arrow pointing inside the car. Tap this so the light above it is on. Alternatively, tap the button with a car and circular arrow inside of it so the light goes off. This turns off the function the recirculates the air already inside of your car.
 Because fog is caused by differing air temperatures, getting the air temperature inside your car to match the air outside will reduce fog. Turn your car fans on the highest setting, and turn the air temperature down as cold as you can stand.This is the fastest method but also the coldest, so be prepared to shiver a bit!

, The defrost vent will direct air straight at your windshield, but the cool air will help your windshield temperature match the air temperature outside. This can help get rid of the fog on your windshield.

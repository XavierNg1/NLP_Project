 The weather forecast for tomorrow won’t always give you an accurate prediction, but it will give you an idea. Check online or dial into your local news station to see tomorrow’s forecast. Look at the percentage prediction of snow. If the forecast calls for over an 80% chance, then the chances are high.


You should also take a look at the hourly forecast for tomorrow. See if the precipitation is suppose to increase or decrease as the day progresses.;
, Parents and students may be able to call a number provided by the school to find out information on school delays or cancellations. Since it comes from your school directly, this is the most reliable way to obtain information. Most schools are equipped with such a system, but check to be sure before the next big weather problem hits.


You may also check the school's website, if it has one, for a delay/cancellation notice.
Many websites will list this information clearly on the front page.
 The best way to plan ahead is to review your school's policies on inclement weather. Review your school's handbook or website for any information on your school's rules for weather. If a school is prepared, they will have this documented for parents and students.


For example: a school might cancel school without question, if snow reaches above three feet. School could be canceled if the power is out in the school or neighboring communities.
Another common policy is to cancel or delay school if public transportation if down.
 This means having all your homework done and packed away as it normally would be. You should also mentally expect there will be school the next day. Several snow day predictions have been wrong. You don't want to wake up to disappointment or panic because you haven't studied for your math test!


If school is cancelled, then you are in for a surprise! It makes the fun even better. Even if it's not cancelled, you can do your research and be the first to know about the next big snowstorm to hit your town!

 If your child experienced first degree burns, which are characterized by redness and mild swelling, it will take approximately 3 to 6 days to heal. Blisters and severe pain, signs of a second degree burn, could take as long as three weeks to heal. A third degree burn, which will cause waxy white, leather, brown, or charred skin, will likely require some type of surgical procedure., Doctors often prescribe custom pressure garments, silicone gel sheets, or custom made inserts. None of these directly heal the skin, but some do reduce itching and protect the area from further damage. Furthermore, they will all prevent your child from scratching the wound when it itches, which could cause scarring., Give him a child or infant strength dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin). Follow the instructions on the bottle. If he has never had this medication before, consider contacting a doctor first. Refrain from giving Ibuprofen to babies under six months.It is difficult to tell if a baby is in pain. A good sign though is if her cries are louder, more high pitched, and longer than usual. She might also grimace, wrinkle her brow, squeeze her eyes shut. She may not be willing to eat or sleep at regularly scheduled times.
 If your infant suffered a second- or third-degree burn, your doctor should provide you with a home care plan that involves dressing changes, special creams or ointments, and possibly other treatments. Follow this plan to the letter, call your doctor with any questions or concerns, and make sure you bring your child in for follow up appointments as recommended.
 If your child appears to be developing some scar tissue, you can start treating the scarring with massage. Rub a moisturizing lotion into tissue gently, working up and down the scar with a small circular motion.Wait until the area is fully healed to begin scar massage. You should do this several times a day for at least a few weeks.

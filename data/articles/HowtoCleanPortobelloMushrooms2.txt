 The high moisture content of mushrooms makes them extremely perishable. Once removed from their packaging, they will quickly shrivel and get slimy unless they’re used immediately. Their original packaging is created to allow them to breathe and release their gases while retaining their moisture.If you don’t use all of them and still have mushrooms left in the container, simply wrap them back up in the original packaging.
 Not all mushrooms come prepackaged; you may have gotten yours loose from the produce department. If so, place them into ziplock baggies when you get them home. Don’t seal the bags up all the way – leave them partially unsealed so the mushroom gases can escape. This will also help them retain moisture.Avoid putting mushrooms in paper bags. This can make them wrinkled and spongy.
 Once mushrooms start soaking up additional moisture, they will deteriorate quickly. Store them in a dry area. If your kitchen is extremely humid, consider sticking them in the fridge. Avoid covering mushrooms with damp paper towels. This is an outdated technique that will actually speed up their deterioration.

 The best way to ensure you will have enough money to retire, is to increase the amount you are saving. If you have any additional income that you are saving consider putting it into a pension fund. This is one of the most tax efficient ways to invest your money and it will likely make more interest than sitting in a savings account.For example, if you live in the United States you can put money into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA).
Alternatively, if you live in Canada you can put money into a Registered Retirement Saving Plan (RRSP).;
, If you have a personal pension, you should always contribute as much as you can annually. Similarly, if your employer offers a pension make sure that you opt in to the pension and make yearly contributions. In some instances, your employer may match the amount you contribute, allowing you to earn more money for your pension.For example, if you make $20,000 (USD) per year and can contribute 5% of your income to a pension, your employer may contribute an additional 3%. This means your employer would be contributing $600/year.
If you are unable to contribute to your pension, that allotment may carry over to the next year depending on the rules in your jurisdiction.
 Depending on the rules and regulations in your jurisdiction, you may receive tax relief for contributing money to your pension. Make sure that you claim this yearly on your taxes. By doing this, you may be allowed to make even bigger contributions.

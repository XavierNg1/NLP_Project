 Start by drawing a bumpy horizontal line that runs across the entirety of the page. Try to put this line on the upper half of the paper.Also, sketch two quarter circles that get cut off by each bottom corner. Imagine they would wrap around 360 degrees if the paper didn't stop. These two are reference shapes and will be erased later.;
, Draw garden shrubs inside each shape in the bottom corners. You can now erase the two quarter circles themselves, leaving just the plants inside.
 Draw a road that leads off into the distance. Start at the bottom of the page, and make the road get skinnier as you go. Keep the road winding until it dead ends into the bumpy horizontal line you drew earlier, which is now acting as a mountain range in the distance.
 For those who are more comfortable with their artistic skills, draw a tree on the right side of the page. Have the base of the trunk start at the top of the bush on the right side, and start extending branches once the trunk is over the hillside.
 All now that's left to do is draw your sun. Have it peering over the mountainside as kind of a half circle.
, You could add shadows and highlights if you want and we're done!

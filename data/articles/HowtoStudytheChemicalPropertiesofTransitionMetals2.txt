 The exact information that you need to know and understand will be dependent upon your individual course. You may need to simply memorize which elements are the transition metals. Alternatively, you may need to be able to list their properties and be able to apply this knowledge in a lab setting.


Ask your professor for guidance on what you need to know specifically for the course.
If you’re curious, learn it all!

, The easiest way to study new information is to put it into small chunks on flashcards. You can frequently flip through these flashcards and study the same information until you have it memorized. Flashcards foster active recall which helps you to retain information better.Write the chemical properties of the various transition metals on individual flashcards to study them and memorize them long-term.
 Chemistry has many levels of complexity and you may need to know this material in more depth than was covered here. Go to your library or search online for tutorials that talk about the more complex concepts involved with these elements. Some topics you can search for more information on include:Electron geometry
Ligand bonding
Pi bonds
Coordinate complexes

, You may have questions about some of the specific properties of these elements. Don’t hesitate to ask your teacher or professor to clarify the material. They are there to help you understand the material and facilitate your mastery of these concepts.


Attend office hours if you are too shy to ask questions during class itself.

 To get the correct waist measurement, make sure your underwear isn't cinching your waist. You may need to remove it.
 While standing straight, bend over to the front or side and make a note of where your body creases. This is your natural waist. It's the narrowest part of your torso, generally located between your rib cage and belly button.
 Keep it parallel to the floor. Do not hold your breath or suck your stomach in. Hold your body erect in a comfortable standing position to get an accurate measurement. Be sure you don't draw it too tight.
 Look at the number in the mirror or carefully look down at it while keeping your back straight. Mark the number down on paper.
 This is usually located 7 to 9 inches (17.8 to 22.9Â cm) below your natural waist. Keep the tape measure parallel to the floor.
 Be sure to prevent yourself from drawing it too tightly.
 Look at the number in the mirror and bend your head down while keeping your feet together and your legs straight. Mark the measurement down on paper.

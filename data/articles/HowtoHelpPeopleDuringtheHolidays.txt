 We don't really pay attention to the signs reading, "Will work for food!" How about making a little difference in a struggling person's life?;
, When you stop at that stoplight where the person is standing, climb out and give them the basket with a "Merry Christmas!" Seeing them smile back will make your day. And you can look forward to the thought that their life will be that much better. Spread the Christmas spirit around!

There are many families who are struggling with the economic crisis, have single parents, or one parent who is in prison. You can help by joining a charity (as mentioned below) or going to areas where people have less. You can pass out gifts for their children, from something small like an action figure, to something bigger. It will be sure to put a smile on their faces. You will know that you are brightening up lives.

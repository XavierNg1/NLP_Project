 If you're running short on time in the morning, keep your bed head hair. Wet your fingers with water and run them through your hair, focusing on any frizzy spots.You can stop there, leaving your hair loose, or you can pull it up into a messy bun.


If your hair is shoulder length or shorter, keep it loose. The messy bun will only work if your hair is long enough to quickly pull back, without resorting to pinning it up.
 This works with best if your hair has a lot of volume. Blow dry your hair to create extra volume, then comb it up onto the top of your head. Make a ponytail at the top of your head. Take the tail and wrap it around the elastic band that's securing the ponytail. Secure the knot with hair pins.You can also braid the ponytail before wrapping it into the knot, for a more finished look., You have lots of options when it comes to braiding your hair. Create one braid that falls straight down the back of your head, or one that angles across the side of your neck. If you have time or straight hair, create a sleek braid for a put-together look. Or keep the braid chunky and loose, with tendrils tugging out of the braid., If you're short on time, simply throw your hair up into a loose, messy ponytail. If you have more time, consider a sleek and styled ponytail. Wear it on the top of your head, low towards the nape of your neck, or off to the side.

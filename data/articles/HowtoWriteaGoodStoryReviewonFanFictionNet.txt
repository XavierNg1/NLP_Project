, Some authors dislike unsigned reviews.
, Write a general summary of how much you liked the story. Make this positive. If you liked it a lot you could say something like 'I loved this! It was so imaginative.' If you didn't like it much, pick out one positive thing, for example 'the plot was good' or 'I liked the way you wrote the dialogue'.
 Put them in quotation marks and then write about why they stood out. Don't be afraid to repeat yourself. If two or three lines stood out for good description, put them all in because this will encourage the writer.
, Phrase your criticisms in a polite, friendly way. Instead of 'I hated the way you wrote Draco's dialogue! He would never talk like that! Don't ever try to write him again, you suck!' try 'The way you wrote Draco's dialogue seemed a bit out of character'. Then go on to explain how the writer could improve, for example by watching the programme or reading the books and learning better how the characters would behave, or by checking through for spelling mistakes.
 Say that you can't wait for the next chapter, or that you want to read some of their other stories.

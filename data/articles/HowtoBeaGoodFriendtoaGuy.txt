 Guys don't go to their other male friends' football games, track meets, band or choir concerts, plays. Your job as a good friend would be...to go! Even if he says that you don't have to go...go. That will make him feel like you care for he does or likes.;
, When his birthday rolls around, make it a big deal! Guys don't seem to want to celebrate their birthdays, they may want to but they don't. So make a big deal out of his birthday! Send him a card in the mail, treat him to a movie of his choice, decorate his locker, or just call him on the phone and sing the happy birthday tune! Make him feel appreciated, without overdoing it.
 You're friends so you have to learn to trust him. Don't be too emotional about things though. Like, if your grandma is sick then tell him. If you are having a rough time -- tell him. It'll make him feel good knowing you'll trust him. Guys usually don't confide a lot in each other so eventually he'll trust you enough to let his guard down too.
 Little surprises that you may do with your girls may make his day! Leave him a note . Stand outside his class door and wave to him when you are in the hallway. You don't want to buy him something super nice, just small treats.
 Try to talk to him everyday after or before a certain class or at a certain time. He will probably come to look forward to it! Maybe even miss you on days when you aren't there.
 Don't just say, "So...what do you want to talk about?" If you leave the conversation up to him chances are it will go nowhere. Ideas: If you are reading a good book tell him about it or ask get to know you questions.
 Even if he's always busy, offer to hang out with him outside of school. It'll make him feel good to know that you want to spend time with him.
 Guys sometimes hang out with girls because of their soft side. Be there for him. Even if it's asking, "Are you okay?" It will show him you're a caring friend.

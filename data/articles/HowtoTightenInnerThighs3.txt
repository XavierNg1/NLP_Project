Bend your top leg (furthest from the mat) so your foot is flat on the floor and your shin is positioned straight up and down. Keep your lower leg straight, and flex your foot back so your toes are pointing away from your body.Lift your straightened leg about 6â€“8 inches off the ground and bring it back down to hover over the ground.








Do these hip adductions on both sides of your body for the complete workout.
Complete 2 sets, doing about 10-20 reps for each leg.

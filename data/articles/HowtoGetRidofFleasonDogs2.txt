 Fleas love to hide in carpets, and an aerosol spray treatment can kill the fleas and their eggs, protecting your dog and your family.


Purchase a can of flea spray for carpets online or in retail stores.
 Most powders contain toxins such as boric acid, which will kill fleas but can also be dangerous for your dog and other pets. Powders also leave a residue behind.


Consider using powders when you know you will be away for a while, such as before vacation.
 These can be purchased from hardware stores or pet supply stores and you can also hire an exterminator to fog your home if you have a flea infestation.


Remember that foggers will work best in open spaces. They will not be able to kill fleas that are hiding between furniture cushions, for example. Use an aerosol spray or powder for hard to reach places in addition to your fogger.

 If you want to make cool-looking costume staves for live action roll playing or cosplay, wooden dowels, available at any hardware store, are the perfect choice. They're already uniform and clean, available in many lengths and widths. Other options for the base of your staff include:


Old broom or mop handles
Broken hockey sticks
Axe handles
Shovel handles
Curtain rods
PVC pipe

, Red and black work best to give your wizard's staff a cool and metallic finish. It'll look like something other than what it is, which is the idea. For a cool effect, do a base wrap with black tape and then wrap red electrical tape winding down the staff, like a devious serpent or dripping blood.
 No staff would be complete without a gazing ball atop it. For a cool effect, look for small bouncy balls in the toys section at the store, or check out other kinds of lightweight balls that would look appropriate. Some are streaked with psychedelic colors that would be perfect for a staff.


If you want to change the color, get some spray paint and paint it carefully outside, making sure you're in a well-ventilated area and have adult supervision.
At the top of your staff, you might also want to hang scarves or other decorations to complete the kind of staff you want. Get creative and go crazy.
 To make sure you've got a good grip on your staff while you're on the battlefield, it's a good idea to fashion something to hold onto. If you've got an old football lying around, cut the seams apart and use one of the individual diamond-shaped sections to fashion a leather-like wrap-around grip that you can hold onto. Sew it together with twine for a perfect rustic-finish.


Alternatively, you could get another color of electrical tape and wrap around the area several times to get a hand-shaped place to hold.

 It doesn't matter what color although choose a color you like personally.


Use one that's a size/half a size up of your normal size, if you're going to do belting, or tying in the back.;
,, Then lay it flat on the ground/table and line the seams up.
 Mark dots where you want the V-neck to be. Once you've measured up the neck, start cutting in the V formation. Hem stitch to prevent fraying after cutting.


Make sure there's no mistakes with the neckline. Adjust if needed.
 Flip the t-shirt over, and mark two dots in the middle of the t-shirt. Make these around an inch or two (2.5-5cm) apart. Then cut small holes where the dots were.
 Loop it through the two holes. Do this by sticking one end of the tie under the t-shirt, and pulling it through the hole, outwards. Then do the same with the other.
 If you'd rather a knot or a more fancy bow, tie as required (you may need to follow a bow-tying tutorial for fancier bows).
 Try the t-shirt on and check the effect in the mirror.
 For example, use fabric paint to draw the image of a person who is wearing the bow, as shown in this image. You could also add writing, more ties, etc., as your creativity inspires you to do.
 You could stitch it to make it fitted or draw it in at the back with a back tie, as wished.

 Just like with a small child, it is important to mark out your tree's growth during the first 2 years of its life in order to determine its adult form.


After permanently planting your olive tree, the first pruning should be done in summer.
Using pruning shears, get rid of all secondary shoots less than 30 inches (76.2 cm) in length.;
, To do this, you should tie the main trunk in order to keep secondary shoots from growing.


Starting at the base, wrap a gardening rope or a normal rope around the olive tree's trunk until you reach a height of 40 inches (101.6 cm).
The ties should be firm, but not too tight, because this could strangulate the trunk and cause the upper branches to dry out.
To keep this from happening, change the rope out for a new one regularly.
 During the first year and a half, it is highly probably that secondary shoots will continue to appear, despite having correctly pruned the tree.


Check weekly for the growth of new secondary shoots.
If you happen to find one, cut it off with pruning shears while it is still green or it will become more difficult to remove it and multiple new shoots will appear around that spot in the following weeks.

 If you’re an older child, your parents may give you some say in how you divide your time between them, particularly if they each live nearby. Do your best to be fair about the amount of time you spend with each parent.

For instance, if you’re away on vacation with one parent, be sure to call and check in with the other. This helps each of your parents feel loved and maintains your connection with them both.
It’s also a great idea to keep both parents in the loop about what’s happening in your life. One parent may be in the dark about academic or extracurricular achievements. Be sure to call them up and tell them when something happens, good or bad., The stress of your parent’s divorce may have caused you to rethink your extracurriculars, but you shouldn’t. Playing sports, participating in clubs, and being involved at your school is an important part of your identity. Sticking with these activities can help you cope with other changes and give you something constructive to do.

You should also keep participating in any birthday parties or sleepovers you are invited to., Having something fun to do in your free time will keep your mind occupied and fight stress. Pick up an old hobby or explore a new one. A hobby can be anything that is positive and constructive. Try doing puzzles, gardening, riding horses, swimming, or volunteering with shelter animals., Even if you had to move, it’s important for you to stay connected with your peer group. Ask your parents if you can meet up with your friends after school or on weekends. You might even schedule video calls via Skype or Hangouts to see your old friends more often., Coping with your feelings after a divorce is a major hurdle. You may find yourself still struggling months or years afterwards. If you continue to have trouble getting used to the new arrangements, ask your parents if you can see a counselor.

You might talk to the counselor at your school or ask a peer who has dealt with divorce for a recommendation.

 Pour ½ cup (118 ml) of skim milk into a microwave-safe mug or bowl. Place the milk in the microwave, and heat on high for 30 seconds to steam it.You can substitute your favorite non-dairy milk for the skim if you prefer.
 Once the milk is steamed, add it to a large bowl along with 1 cup (237 ml) of hot espresso and ½ tablespoon (7 ½ ml) of syrup in your choice of flavor. Mix gently until the ingredients are just combined.You can use any kind of syrup that you like to flavor your latte. Caramel and maple are two tasty options, but you can purchase coffee flavoring syrups in a wide range of flavors, such as hazelnut, brown sugar, cinnamon, and coconut.
To keep the calories down in your latte, it’s best to use a sugar-free syrup.
 When all of the ingredients are combined, use an immersion blender or a handheld electric mixer to blend the mixture on low. Continue blending until there is quite a bit of foam., Once you’ve finished blending the espresso mixture, transfer it to a large mug. Use a spoon to hold back the foam as you’re pouring. After you’ve filled the mug, add as much or as little of the foam to the top as you’d like.If you prefer, you can allow the foam to pour into the mug as you fill it. However, you won’t be able to control how much is in your latte.
 After you’ve topped the latte with the foam, you can add more of the flavored syrup. Add up to ½ tablespoon (7 ½ ml) over the foam to increase the flavor.You can squeeze the syrup in stripes, zig zags, or even a swirl over the top of the latte to give it a more decorative look.

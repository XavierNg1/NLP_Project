 Sometimes, the best way to get out of an uncomfortable situation is to be honest and to the point about it. Keep it simple: tell your date that you feel like it isn’t working out, settle your bill, and leave.If you want to soften the blow a little, try saying something like, “You seem like a really nice person, but I just don’t feel like we’re a good match.”
If you’re feeling unsafe, or if your date’s behavior is really inappropriate, don’t feel that you owe them any explanation. Just tell them you’re leaving and make your exit.;
, If you’re not feeling it, but you really don’t want to hurt your date’s feelings, try an excuse that will allow you to make a graceful exit. Consider one of these techniques:Pretend to be sick. Tell your date you’re feeling sick to your stomach, or that you’re having an allergic reaction to something in the food.
If you want to stick it out a little longer to be polite, tell them you can only stay for a short amount of time. For example, say something like: “Hey, I’m really sorry, but I just remembered I have to go pick up my friend at 7:30, so I can only stay for half an hour.”

, These apps can send you a convincing fake call or text that will give you an excuse to leave in a hurry.For example, the app may send you a call that is supposedly from a relative or neighbor claiming to be dealing with some kind of emergency. Just pick up the call and respond as if it were real (“Oh, no! Okay, Mom, I’ll be right there.”).
 If your date is aggressive or making you feel unsafe, you may need to leave in a hurry. To avoid creating a confrontation, excuse yourself to the bathroom and then quickly leave the venue.


If you are feeling extremely threatened and don’t think you can simply leave the venue without incident, go to the restroom and call the police.

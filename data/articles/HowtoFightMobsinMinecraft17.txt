 Once it is within two blocks, critical hit it (jump and strike). You do not have to retreat after hitting it as it is very slow.
 Look around and make sure there are no more mobs around. Be careful because every time you hit a zombie there is a chance another one will spawn nearby. Proceed to collect the experience and any drops, like rotten flesh. It is advised for you to not eat the rotten flesh (unless you can't get other food) because it may give you poison or hunger depending on what you're playing. If you do get poison or hunger, stay in one place until it goes away to prevent your hunger bar from dropping or drop even more.
 This knocks them back several blocks. Also, when focused on you, a zombie will not attack a tamed wolf that is attacking it.

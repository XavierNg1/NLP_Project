 There are different ways people are shy. You can be shy in more than one way. Seeing the forms of your shyness can help you focus your effort to overcome it. If you are not a medical professional qualified to diagnose psychological conditions, then you will need to see one in order to find out which of these apply to you:


Anxious shyness includes not just social anxiety, but also extends to social phobias.These conditions can be managed by a therapist, psychiatrist or other properly licensed individual.
Introversion gets often cited in cases of shyness. Shyness related to introversion is very common, and may exhibit itself in roughly 50% of the population to some degree or other. This is a personality trait, and can be managed with regulated extroversion (building extroverted skills and traits).;
, Record your experiences of shyness and your attempts to be outgoing. Write down how you feel and as many details as you can remember. You can look at your journal later to see if any strong patterns emerge.


Make this a daily habit, if possible. Incorporate it into your routine. Give yourself a treat for completing a journal entry to solidify it into your daily routine.
Be honest with yourself. If you catch yourself trying to rationalize what you're saying, chances are, you could dig a bit deeper into the true meaning of what you're trying to express. Instead, try and state it as plainly as possible.
Pay special attention to how you feel. Mark your emotions when you feel them. This way you can take control of your feelings.
 What you choose to do can have a big impact on how much you interact with other people. Staying at home instead of going out means there will be very little opportunity to socialize. When you do this all the time, you get used to it.


Ditch your mobile phone. Leave it at home when you go out. Put it in the freezer or microwave (no cooking) for a few hours, until you forget about it. You're more likely to talk to other people.

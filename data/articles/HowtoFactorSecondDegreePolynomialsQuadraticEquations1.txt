 The standard format for the quadratic equation is:ax2 + bx + c = 0

Start by ordering the terms in your equation from highest to lowest power, just like this standard format. For example, take:6 + 6x2 + 13x = 0

We will re-order this expression so it's easier to work with by simply moving the terms around:6x2 + 13x + 6 = 0

, Factoring the polynomial will result in two smaller expressions which can be multiplied to produce the original polynomial:6x2 + 13x + 6 = (2x + 3)(3x + 2)

In this example, (2x +3) and (3x + 2) are factors of the original expression, 6x2 + 13x + 6.
 Multiply the factors you identified. Then combine like terms and you're done. Start with:(2x + 3)(3x + 2)

Let's test it, multiplying the terms using FOIL (first - outer - inner - last), obtaining:6x2 + 4x + 9x + 6

From here, we can add 4x and 9x together since they're like terms. We know our factors are correct because we get the equation we started with:6x2 + 13x + 6

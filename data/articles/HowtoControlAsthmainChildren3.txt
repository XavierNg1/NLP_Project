 This is very important because certain food products can trigger asthma attacks in sensitive individuals.


Give your child more organic vegetables and fruits because these do not contain harmful chemicals.






You should also try to give your child more plant proteins.

Give your child calcium in other ways besides milk because milk can trigger allergies in susceptible children.






Provide your child with plenty of water to drink instead of sugary substances.






An effective way for parents to identify possible foods that may be triggering an asthma attack in their child is to eliminate suspicious foods one at a time. Try eliminating wheat or sugar to see if your child’s condition improves. If you eliminate a food and your child’s condition improves, then you know to avoid giving that food to your child, as it is likely an asthma trigger.
 If your child tends to experience asthma symptoms when exercising or playing, learn some effective ways to help your child control exercise-induced symptoms.


Have your child warm up slowly before playing. It can also be a good idea to take a break from the action when your child is playing. Give your child a quick break to relax for a few minutes and be sure to provide a drink of water.

Help your child do physical activity that minimizes the symptoms. Some sports like golf can be better for your child than rigorous, non-stop activities such as soccer. This is because there are periods of rest in-between the action, which may be necessary to allow children with asthma to catch their breath. Just remember that you should never make regular sports off limits to your child if he wants to play, because this will make your child feel different from everyone else. If your child loves to play baseball, encourage him to play and try to find a way to help reduce asthma symptoms while your child is playing.

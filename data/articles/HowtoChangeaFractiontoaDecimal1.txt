 Each number in a fraction has a name. The top number in a fraction is called a numerator. The bottom number is called a denominator. A fraction expresses the idea of the numerator divided by the denominator. For example, the fraction three fourths is written as 3/4. It means that 3 is being divided by 4. You can use this idea to change fractions into decimals., The first thing you need to do to change a decimal into a fraction is to rewrite the fraction as a workable math problem. For example, you have the simple fraction 1/2. This means 1 divided by 2. You need to rewrite your problem as follows: 1 ÷ 2 = x., You need to solve for x in your problem to change the fraction into a decimal. For 1/2, 2 does not go into 1 any times. You must add a zero behind the decimal place to divide the larger number, 2, into the smaller number, 1. Your problem is now: 1.0 ÷ 2 = x. You know that 2 multiplied by 5 is 10, but you have to remember your decimal. So 1.0 ÷ 2 = 0.5.If you have a fraction that is a number over itself, such as 2/2, 4/4, or 7/7, the answer will always be 1. The rewritten problem would be 7 ÷ 7 = x and 7 divided by 7 is 1.
 There are simple fractions that have remainders once you divide them once. For example, to change 1/4 into a decimal, you rewrite it as: 1.0 ÷ 4 = x. If you divide 4 into 1.0, you get .2 with a remainder 2. If you have a remainder, you need to bring another zero after the decimal. You new problem would be: 1.00 ÷ 4 = x. You know that you have a remainder of 2. Add the extra zero behind the 2 and divide by 4. 20 divided by 4 is 5 with no remainder. 1/4 as a decimal is 0.25.


Always make sure you solve your division problem until there is no remainder.
Make sure you keep track of where your decimal needs to be. You don't want to get the wrong decimal because you have moved where your decimal point needs to be., Some fractions do not divide as nicely as others. When this happens, you will end up with a repeating decimal. This means that there is always a remainder and that the decimal number keeps repeating without end. For example, you need to change 1/3 into a decimal. The rewritten problem would be 1.0 ÷ 3 = x.


1.0 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1. Bring in another 0. 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1, just like before. No matter how many 0s you bring in, the remainder will always be 1. This means that your decimal is 0.33333. The 3s will go on forever.
To write this as an answer, cut off the decimals to the amount of places needed for your assignment. You cal also write it as 0.3 with a straight line above the 3. This symbol indicates that the 3 repeats., There are some fractions considered more complicated than others because it takes more to divide them. 1/2, 1/4, and 3/4 are simple fractions. Other fractions are more complicated. For example, you need to convert 1/8 into a decimal. The rewritten equation is 1.00 ÷ 8 = x. 1.0 divided by 8 is .2 with a remainder of 2. 20 divided by 8 is 2 with a remainder of 4. 40 divided by 8 is 5 with no remainder. Your decimal would be 0.125., Complicated fractions still have a definite decimal answer. There are some fractions that will always have a remainder. Unlike the repeating decimal, the decimal has no pattern. For example, you need to express 3/19 as a decimal. Rewrite the problem as 3.00 ÷ 19 = x.


3.0 divided by 19 is 1 with a remainder of 11. Add another 0. 110 divided by 19 is 5 with a remainder of 15. In this case, you need to keep adding 0s. 150 divide by 19 is 7 with a remainder of 17. 170 divide by 19 is 8 with a remainder of 18. 180 divide by 19 is 9 with a remainder of 9. You can keep going, but you will continue to have a remainder. If we cut it off here, our answer would be 0.15789.Make sure you write your decimals to as many places as you need them to be.
 You may have to change a compound fraction. A compound fraction is one with a whole number as well as a fraction. For example, you need to convert 3 3/4 into a decimal. It is not as complicated as it looks. The integer, which is the whole number that isn't the fraction, will always go before the decimal point. Solve the remaining fraction like normal.


For this problem, the rewritten problem is 3.00 ÷ 4 = x. 3.0 divide by 4 is .7 with a remainder of 2. 20 divide by 4 is 5 with no remainder. Your answer would be 3.75.

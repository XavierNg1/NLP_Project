 Take showers or baths, and wash your hair every or every other day so it doesn't get greasy. Take action to prevent pimples with acne scrubs. If you have a pimple you should apply anti-pimple cream if it bothers you. Put some on the pimple before bed and take it off in the morning. Also be sure to use body wash. Wear deodorant, and be sure to brush your teeth well, so your breath doesn't smell and your teeth stay nice and healthy.;
, Only use a little eyeshadow and lip gloss. If you want to, use a little blush. You should wait until you are sure you are ready before you use eyeliner and mascara.


Perfume is optional, but if your going to use it be sure you know how. Spray some on one of your wrists, and rub your wrists together. Or, spray some on your neck. It may seem like a little amount, but a little perfume is better than a lot (be sure that you don't put on too much).
 Shop at places like Forever 21, H&M, PacSun, ModCloth, Hollister, Justice, The Children's Place, Abercrombie, Betsey Johnson, Old Navy or wherever you feel comfortable be sure to wear stuff that is simple. .
 Get 3-4 friends who are nice to you, and you like. Try to have sleepovers with each other and hang out.
 Pick cool colors that you like for your backpack, pencils, and erasers.
 If you like your hair in pigtails, don't be afraid to wear it like that because some people think it's for "little girls". See what works best for you and your routine.

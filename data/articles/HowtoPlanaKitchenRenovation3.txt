 You might want everything; an architect, designer, builder and contractor as well as a team of sub-contractors. Or, you might want to do it yourself and call in help when you get stuck.


Talk to contractors, at the very least. Unless you are experienced with building and renovations, you will need someone to help you get necessary permits and manage the overall project.
 You should do the same thing if you are working with designers and other professionals. Getting at least 3 quotes or estimates will help you determine who fits into your budget.
 Once you hire a contractor, discuss how long the work will take. This will help you plan your renovation and how you will function without the use of your kitchen.

 Newly planted wisteria does not do well in cold weather and the buds can be damaged by frost in the spring. If you live in an area with cold weather, you will need to plant wisteria somewhere that is sheltered so that the buds are protected from the frost.You can shelter the plant by wrapping it in burlap during the winter and when frost is expected during the spring. Be sure to keep an eye on the weather and stay on top of any frost warnings.
You can also plant wisteria so that it is protected by a structure, such as a screen, but this may not work if the species of wisteria requires a lot of sun.
 This is when the buds for next year are formed and the plant could benefit from some extra water.Wisteria does not need to be watered often and should actually only be watered if you live in an area that receives less than an inch of rain per week. Otherwise, wisteria will receive enough water.

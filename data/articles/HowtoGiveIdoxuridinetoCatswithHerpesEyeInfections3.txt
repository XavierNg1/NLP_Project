 Before placing ointment in your cat’s eye, wash your hands. This helps keep any bacteria or other contaminants from transferring from your hands to your cat’s eye or the medication., Place the tube of medicine between your thumb and index finger. Make sure you are holding on to it securely. Point the tip down towards the floor., Place the cat in your lap. Gently lower the bottom eyelid with the fingers on your free hand. Place the ointment along the lower lid in the space between the lid and the eye. Make sure not to touch the tip of the ointment to the eye.If you find it hard to apply the ointment directly from the tube, ask your vet for sterile cotton swabs to apply the medication.
If your cat squirms in your lap, try wrapping your cat in a blanket or towel to secure it and keep yourself from being scratched.
 As soon as the ointment is in the cat’s eye, they will start blinking. Between the blinking and the ointment melting in the eye, it should spread around to the entire eyeball.You may see ointment building up in the corners of the eye. This is normal.
 After you have finished administering the medicine, wash your hands again. This helps prevent you from spreading anything you may have gotten on your hands.

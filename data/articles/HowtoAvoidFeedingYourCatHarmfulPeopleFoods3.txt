 If you want to give your cat people foods that they will enjoy and can eat safely, start with cooked foods like salmon or chicken. Remove the skin from the chicken before you serve it to your cat to reduce the fat content. Cats are carnivores and require meat in their diet. Cooked chicken is a good protein source for cats. Cooked salmon also provides omega-3 fatty acids for your cat.You can also give your cat other cooked meats like beef or pork. Cooked fish like cod or tilapia are also good for cats.
 These fruits are considered safe for consumption for cats. Apples are a good source of fiber and vitamin C for your cat. Remove the skin before giving apples to your cat. Bananas contain potassium and are easy to digest for cats. Cantaloupe, skin removed, contains nutrients that are beneficial for your cat’s skin and eyes., Spinach is full of vitamins and minerals, making it a healthy treat for cats. Cooked pumpkin is low on calories and high on nutrients. It’s a good option for a special treat for your cat, whether canned or fresh.If your cat is at risk of bladder stones, do not give them spinach.
 Cooked eggs are a good source of protein and vitamin B for cats. Many cat foods already contain cooked eggs and are safe for consumption. Always cook the eggs well before feeding them to your cat., No matter which safe people foods you give your cat, always do so in moderation and slowly. Give your cat a small amount of the people foods to try, along with their regular food. They may experience a bit of gastrointestinal upset when they try new foods, which is to be expected. Give them new people foods slowly over time so they can get used to it and decide if they like it.If your cat has an adverse reaction to certain safe people foods, or doesn’t seem to like them, do not try to force them to eat the people foods.
If you are unsure whether your cat can eat certain people foods, check with your vet first.

 Grow it either in a garden bed or in a large to medium container.


A sunny wall is the best spot for this plant; it likes sun and it needs to climb.
 For a garden bed or for a container, the soil should be moderately rich. The soil should be well drained but able to hold moisture.


Add some rotted organic matter to the soil to enhance the growing medium.
 This will help keep the moisture in the soil and reduces weed growth.

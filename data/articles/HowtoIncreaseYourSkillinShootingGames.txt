You don't need super jumping abilities or swift running to be a Super-Soldier!;
, Cover! Cover!


Don't just stand there like rookie.
Move back to cover.
Let the enemy come to you.
Make sure the cover protects even the tip of your head. they can still snag a lucky head shot with even a little bit of head showing.



This is a rule every Shooting-Game fans should know.


Don't just shoot as soon as you spot an enemy.
Be patient.
Look closer. He/She might be one of you team mates.

It's better to get a small amount of bullets through your enemy than a spray of bullets that shoots past them.


Aim if the enemy is far away.

It usually increases your weapon's accuracy.



Never ever just stand in one spot and then shoot.
Move around while moving the cross-hair.

It's very simple if you try.


If you can jump, jump to the right or to the left while moving.

It can sometimes confuse the ones who are shooting back at you.


Don't move around too much.

Just enough so you can still see your guy.



When you have no ammo left or if your just in the middle of reloading and a guy just pops out of nowhere and start shooting, CHARGE AT HIM/HER!!
This (sometimes) could be the only thing to do when that happens.


Melee them if you can.
If you don't want to risk it then just run to cover and finish reloading.



Whenever you shoot to much you will eventually lose a whole clip in less than 5 seconds.


Always look at your ammo bar (if you have one).
If your ammo is less than 25% then reload unless there is still some enemies shooting you.
If there's not then reload.
If you have any spare time when your just walking, reload.

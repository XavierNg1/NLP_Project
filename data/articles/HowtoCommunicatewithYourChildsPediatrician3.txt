They can also assist you in determining whether or not you need an appointment. This helps you avoid asking simple questions during an appointment or calling the doctor unnecessarily.If there is a problem the staff cannot answer, they can contact the doctor so they can get back to you.

This is common, so do not get upset.You can ask your doctor about why waiting is a good option. Ask them to explain how this is a better treatment option.

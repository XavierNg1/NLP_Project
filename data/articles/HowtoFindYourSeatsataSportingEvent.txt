 Usually the ticket will say what gate you should enter at. If it has no information of that sort, ask an usher outside the venue.;
, There should be signs above your head showing where the different sections are. If so, follow the signs. If you are having trouble with that, try looking at a map. There may be a map inside with each section labeled. Use this to locate the direction you should go.
 Once you reach the open, there will be an usher who can help point you in the right direction. The usher can even escort you to your row.
 Make sure that you go on the right side of the row so you are in your section.
 Remember proper manners for going down past other fans. This would mean being nice and asking them to stand so you may pass, walking with your back to them, and holding any food towards your sides.
 Once you do this once, it should be in your memory how to get back.

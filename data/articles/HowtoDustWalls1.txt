 Place a drop cloth on the floor beneath the walls you will be cleaning. Pull furniture away from the walls and cover it with a sheet., With your broom’s head pointed up and its handle pointed down, lay a rag or towel over the broom head. Ensure as many of the bristles as possible are covered by the towel. To prevent the towel from falling off during use, wrap a piece of string around the broom head at its thickest point.If possible, use a microfiber towel.
 Place the broom head against a corner of the wall where it meets the ceiling. Drag the broom down along the wall in a slow, steady motion. After you’re done, evaluate the section of the wall you just dusted. If any dust remains, run the broom along the strip again., At some point, the towel will become too dusty and dirty to be effective. Evaluate the towel after moving about one-third of the way across the wall. If it is excessively dusty, unbind it from the broom and shake it out over the rubbish bin. Toss it in your laundry basket and cover the broom with another towel just as before., Move to the space on the wall next to the area you just cleaned. Just as before, place the broom head against the top of the wall and move it down the wall in a vertical strip.Continue in this way long the entire wall. When you’ve finished the first wall, move to the one next to it and continue the process until the walls have all been dusted.

 Targeted advertising is based on intelligence gathered by websites, cookies, surveys and more. The best way to develop your own valuable targeting system is to keep track of your customer's purchases and habits.
 Offer discounts or special sales to people who sign up to receive period emails. There are a few ways you can do this.


Sign your customers up for online accounts. When they enter their email to receive a receipt from their purchase, check a box where they will be signed up for periodical emails. You must give your customers the option to opt out from these emails by unchecking the box or asking to be removed in the future.
Create a landing page that you use in advertisements and on social media. In order to access content, your customers or potential customers must sign up using their email address. This is a great way to develop a database of email addresses quickly. However, if people are not required to make a purchase before they sign up, you will have less data with which to target future emails.
 Offer deals on electronics, clothing, and other specific categories in each email. This type of targeted advertising is great for developing repeat customers.


Make sure you offer something valuable to the consumer in each email. Many people opt-out of email newsletters when they arrive too frequently or appear to be spam.

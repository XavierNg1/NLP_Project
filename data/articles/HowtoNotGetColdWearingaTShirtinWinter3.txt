 Although all parts of your body release heat, your head and neck are often exposed which releases major heat.Wear a hat and scarf to keep the heat trapped and circulate throughout your body. Any enclosed hat will do, but avoid visors.


If you can, wear a beanie or a hat that covers your ears. Your ears are one of the first parts of your body to experience damage to cold temperatures.
 If you're not going shirtless, wear a tanktop or thick sleeveless shirt or vest underneath your outfit. This keeps your core warmer, which can help regulate the rest of your body temperature.
 A thick pair of thermals underneath your jeans or sweatpants will keep your body focused on warming the exposed parts. Leggings or tights can also work, as well as high socks.
 Gloves can keep your outer extremities warm to avoid getting frostbite. If you don't need to use your fingers, mittens are better since they keep fingers together and trap heat more effectively than gloves.Gloves don't have to clash your entire outfit. A simple pair of white classy gloves for girls can add a nice tough, and black leather gloves for guys can make you seem cool.
You can purchase "hot hands" or hand warming devices to put inside gloves. These will keep your hands warm without getting too bulky.
 As the night goes on, it's bound to get colder. Temporarily warming up in a blanket or adding an external layer of clothes when the temperature becomes unbearable shouldn't affect your evening or your outfit.


Bring a scarfor sweater, and keep a blanket in your bag. These can be used to sit on to avoid cold benches or bleachers early in the night, as well.

 Crystal is sculpted over a longer time period at lower temperature than glass. Because of this, the lead inside the crystal can be shaped into thinner, more intricate designs. Hold a glass object next to a crystal one and compare the thickness of the material.


On a crystal wine glass, for instance, look for a thinner rim with less of a lip.;
, Take a liquid and pour it into the object or hold the object up and look through it. Regular glass is cloudier than crystal. Crystal with a higher lead content provides a clearer view of anything inside or behind it.For example, a normal drinking glass will make a liquid inside it appear cloudy. Crystal glasses, on the other hand, provide a greater view of the liquid.
 When you hold glass up to the light, nothing happens. Fine crystal, which has a high lead count, will sparkle. Other crystal acts as a prism, causing you to see a rainbow when looking through it.

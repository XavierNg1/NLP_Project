Cuts: These are injuries to the skin caused by something sharp, like a knife.

Scratches: These are slight injuries that happen when a sharp object (like a fingernail or thorn) scrapes along your skin the way a pencil scrapes across paper.

Abrasions: These are scrapes that happen when the skin is rubbed away. For example, you might get a "rug burn" while wrestling with your brother, or a "board burn" if you wipe out on your skateboard when you aren't wearing knee-pads.

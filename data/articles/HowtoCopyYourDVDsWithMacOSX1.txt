Click Create and OSX will create your image file with a .cdr extension., You can watch the movie straight from your hard drive if desired, or convert it and burn a new disc.
 Once you've created your CD/DVD master as a .cdr file, it's a good idea to convert to .dmg by saving as a compressed format if you want to burn a copy. The .cdr is usually too large.


To convert the file, select convert in the top menu. Choose image format "Compressed" and "None" under Encryption. Add a .dmg extension on the file and you'll be ready to burn.

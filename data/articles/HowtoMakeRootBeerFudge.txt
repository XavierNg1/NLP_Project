 To ensure that your fudge will harden after being made, prepare space in your fridge to allow the fudge to have a place to cool off after melting. Depending on how much fudge you want to make, the pan shouldn't take up too much space.;
, It should be the consistency of maple syrup or thicker. Add the rest of your ingredients to the saucepan, turn up the temperature and wait until the mixture reaches a boil. Stir constantly.
 Wait until the temperature reaches the 'softball stage', which is 234 degrees F, which should take around 20 minutes or fewer.
 Taking an egg beater or spoon, beat the mixture until it becomes thick as a result of it cooling down significantly.
 Sprinkle it with your chosen toppings, like pecans, peanuts, or even sprinkles! The possibilities are endless for this treat.
 After it has cooled enough for you to be able to touch it without feeling heat or getting burnt, slice the fudge into small pieces for serving.
 Finished.

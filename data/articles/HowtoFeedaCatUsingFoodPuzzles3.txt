 Numerous household objects can be used to create food puzzles for your cat. Perhaps the most common puzzle to start with is a “box puzzle.”Find a cardboard box with a lid (a shoebox works great).
Use a cup and/or small wooden block to trace shapes on the inside of the lid (These should be slightly larger than your cat’s paws).
Use an X-acto knife to cut out these shapes.
Return the lid to the box and secure it with tape or glue.
Place dry food and/or treats inside.
 Another DIY food puzzle option is to use a toilet paper or paper towel roll. These puzzles are small and easy to make, so you can place several around your house.Use an X-acto knife to cut holes in the tube a little larger than the food/treats.
Seal the ends of the tube, but either (a) folding the ends in or (b) using packing tape.
Fill the tube with food through the holes you created.
 You can create a DIY cat puzzle very simply using a plastic water bottle. The added benefit to using the water bottle is that it makes a funny sounds that cats seem to enjoy.Use an X-acto knife to cut holes in a plastic water bottle, just larger than the food/treats.
Fill the bottle with food/treats.
Tightly close the lid.

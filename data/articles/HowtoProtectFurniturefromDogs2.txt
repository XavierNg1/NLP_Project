 This may prevent your dog from continuing to chew on your furniture in the future.


Use foods or seasonings that will not be toxic to your dog, such as hot sauce or cayenne pepper.
If you have furniture that will stain from food products, such as a sofa, you can purchase a commercial, furniture-safe, anti-chewing spray from a retail store that specializes in pet products.
 This will help your dog understand that they are misbehaving.


Say "No" in a firm manner to your dog at the same moment you see them jumping onto or chewing your furniture. This will convey to them that their behavior needs to stop immediately.
Provide your dog with one of their toys immediately after scolding them, then praise them when they begin playing with or chewing the toy. This will help your dog understand which behavior you find more acceptable.

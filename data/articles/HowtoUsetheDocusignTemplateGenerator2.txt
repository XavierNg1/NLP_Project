, Make sure your Java version is at least 1.6.0_10 or later.


If you don't know what version of Java you have, type this into the command line (excluding the quotation marks): "java -version" and make sure that you are up to date. If you have to upgrade,visit the Java website and update your software.
 Run the following command in the command console (excluding the quotation marks): "java -jar DocuSignTemplateGenerator.jar <PDF file name.pdf>" where the <PDF file name> is the name of the PDF you put into your main user folder.


You'll see the new file in your user folder. This file will have the same name as the PDF, only ending in .dpd.
 Select "Create Template" and upload the new .dpd file. All of the fields that were in the PDF should now automatically be prepped for someone to fill in.

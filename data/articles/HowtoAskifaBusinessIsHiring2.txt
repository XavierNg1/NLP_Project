 Most companies have websites which list their HR employees. It might take some searching to find exactly who you need to talk to, but don’t give up. Most HR departments have at least a general email address listed, and often list the email addresses of individual employees.If, despite your best efforts, you can't find the appropriate email addresses, call the company. Ask if they can give you contact information - preferably an email address - for the hiring manager or recruiter.
 Once you’ve found the email address of a recruiter or hiring manager, take some time to write a clear, polite email. You should use their title, explain who you are, and what type of position you’re looking for.For example, you could write: “Dear Ms. Johnson, I have loved shopping at Forever 18 for many years, and I have recently become interested in taking my love for the store to the next level by working there. I have five years of retail experience, including two years as a manager. Are there any current openings in your company? Thank you for your time.”

, Telling the hiring manger or recruiter you have certain qualifications is one thing. Attach your resume or CV to show your contact that you actually have those qualifications.

 So, compare 10 bites per day, a radical diet choice -- to be explained below -- see the Mayo Clinic diet for after stomach bypass surgery (more detail in the tips section):"Recover:" nothing by mouth, not even water -- about 2 days, getting water intravenously (by IV drip). Do not keep on avoiding water.
Phase 1: "Crash" on the surgeon's clear liquid diet -- 1 to 2 weeks -- healing inside.
Phase 2: "Starve" on 6 one tablespoon pureed "soupy-pasty 1 bite meals" daily -- 2 to 4 weeks.
So far! -- almost 2 months' total -- crash-diet on doctor's orders!
Phase 3: "Starve" on six meals of two tablespoons per day, that's about six 1/4 cup "meals" of soft, mashed foods -- 2 to 4 added weeks of this.
Phase 4: "Starve", for life. 3 tiny 1/2 cup -- 2 to 4 weeks and finally get up to a mini-feast of three "1-cup meals" of soft, chopped foods.Suffer a life sentence: No big, chewy bites of real steak or chicken, etc. -- but, Yes... munch ground or minced meats instead.;
, Realize that if you had "starved" like that (after that dangerous surgery) -- then phase 1 diet is only liquids: "Broth, Unsweetened juice, Milk, Strained cream soup, Sugar-free gelatin -- Doctor's Orders!"for weeks -- safe enough?

, Evidently, "Yes it is safe!" as radical-weight-loss surgeons all agree: clients can survive such a diet!
Realize you have to be virtually starving to lose weight really fast.

 If you can accommodate certain terms for the supplier, you may be able to negotiate better prices for yourself. For example, ordering in bulk and then dealing with storage in your facility will generally result in better prices., Negotiating for a better overall deal can involve more than just price. On your end, you may be asking for a lower price for the product you need, but the supplier may have other interests. If you can offer (and ensure) shorter payment terms than usual, you may be able to reduce the costs. Instead of paying within 30 days, for example, you might get the supplier to reduce its price if you can pay within 15 days., The best negotiating does not happen on a strict timetable. If you are trying to improve the price you pay for certain supplies, you might begin by simply dropping hints over some time. Then, later, you could enter into a formal negotiating session, where you might resolve some topics, but not fully get the price you want. Keep the issue alive, however. After some time, you may convince the supplier to come around to your position., You may begin negotiations with an idea of the "perfect" contract. However, if you hold firm to this, you may lose the deal completely. You need to be willing to give up on minor terms in order to acquire the major ones.For example, if price is your primary concern, you might be able to give up some conditions related to delivery in order to achieve a lower price.

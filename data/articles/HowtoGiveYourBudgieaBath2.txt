 You can often find these in the hair care section of a drug store or superstore. You can also often find them in the gardening section of a home improvement store.


An alternative to a spray bottle is a perch you can place in your own shower, which you can usually find at pet stores. Just place your shower head on a gentle spray, and turn the water on lukewarm.
 Once again, you don't want the water to be too cold. Budgies and other small birds are susceptible to cold.
 Most spray bottles have several settings for the bottle. You don't want a thin stream of water; you need a fine mist for your bird's bath., You want to create a gentle mist that showers down over your bird. Don't spray them right in the face, as most birds will not like that.You can offer this kind of bath everyday if you wish.
 Your bird will dry herself off. Just make sure the area where they are drying off is warm and free of cool breezes.

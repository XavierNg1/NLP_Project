 Search for debris on the ground near wetlands and pools of water. Rocks, fallen logs, branches, and piles of leaves make ideal hiding places. Salamanders must keep their skin moist in order to breathe and hide under these types of objects to shelter themselves from direct sunlight., Slowly flip over pieces of ground debris to find salamanders. Slow, gentle movements may prevent salamanders from becoming alarmed and scurrying away quickly to find another hiding place. Being careful while lifting the debris will help protect other living organisms that may have made their home there.
 Always return ground debris to its original position. Any major disruption to rocks, logs, and other debris could alter the humidity levels, the safety of a salamanderâ€™s habitat, and the safety of other living creatures in the area.

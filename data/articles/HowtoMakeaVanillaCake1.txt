 Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit or 204 degrees Celsius. Dust an eight-inch cake pan with flour and spread melted butter or oil over it using a pastry brush.;
, In a large bowl, sift the cake flour, baking powder, and salt. Sift well, until the dry ingredients are light and fluffy.
 Cut a teaspoon of your butter and add it in the dry ingredients. Blend using an electric blender or hand blender. Continue to do this until all the butter is out. The result should be like loose sand.
 Slowly pour the sugar, one tablespoon at a time. Do not dump all the sugar in at once. To help the vanilla cake stay moist, add each ingredient one at a time. Do the same for the eggs. Blend until well-combined, with the result looking like stiff sand.
 Slowly pour the milk and vanilla extract into the cake batter. Blend until the batter looks glossy and there are no flour streaks.
 Use a rubber spatula to scrape up all the cake batter into the cake pan.
 Place the cake pan into the oven. Have it bake for about 30-35 minutes, which is when the cake springs back when you touch it, and a toothpick comes out dry when you poke the cake.
 Flip the cake pan upside down on a wire rack. To make the cake easier to flip, circle a knife around it. It should pop out. Have the cake cool for about five minutes.
 Using your favorite frosting and icing, frost your cake to your liking. You can also add toppings such as sliced fruit, sprinkles, nuts, chocolate chips, and coconut flakes.

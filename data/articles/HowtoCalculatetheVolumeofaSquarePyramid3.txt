 The edge height is the length of the edge of the pyramid, measured from the apex to one of the corners of the pyramid’s base. As before, you will then use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the perpendicular height of the pyramid.For this example, assume that the edge height can be measured to be 11 cm and you are given that the perpendicular height is 5 cm.
 As before, you need a right triangle to use the Pythagorean Theorem. In this case, however, your unknown value is the base of the pyramid. You know the perpendicular height and the edge height. If you imagine cutting the pyramid diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner and opening it up, the exposed inside face is a triangle. The height of that triangle is the perpendicular height of the pyramid. It divides the exposed triangle into two symmetrical right triangles. The hypotenuse of either right triangle is the edge height of the pyramid. The base of either right triangle is one-half the diagonal of the base of the pyramid.
 Use this imaginary right triangle and assign values to the Pythagorean Theorem. You know the perpendicular height, h,{\displaystyle h,} which is one leg of the Pythagorean Theorem, a{\displaystyle a}. The edge height of the pyramid, l,{\displaystyle l,} is the hypotenuse of this imaginary right triangle, so it takes the place of c{\displaystyle c}. The unknown diagonal of the base of the pyramid is the remaining leg of the right triangle, b.{\displaystyle b.} After you make these substitutions, the equation will look like this:


a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}


h2+b2=l2{\displaystyle h^{2}+b^{2}=l^{2}}


, You will need to rearrange the equation to isolate the variable b{\displaystyle b} and then solve for its value.h2+b2=l2{\displaystyle h^{2}+b^{2}=l^{2}}..........(revised equation)


b2=l2−h2{\displaystyle b^{2}=l^{2}-h^{2}}..........(substitute h2 from both sides)


b=l2−h2{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {l^{2}-h^{2}}}}..........(square root both sides)


b=112−52{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {11^{2}-5^{2}}}}..........(insert numerical values)


b=121−25{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {121-25}}}..........(simplify squares)


b=96{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {96}}}..........(subtract values)


b=9.80{\displaystyle b=9.80}..........(simplify square root)

Double this value to find the diagonal of the square base of the pyramid. Thus, the diagonal of the pyramid’s base is 9.8*2=19.6 cm.
 The base of the pyramid is a square. The diagonal of any square is equal to the length of a side times the square root of 2. Conversely, you can find the side of the square from its diagonal by dividing by the square root of 2.For this sample pyramid, the diagonal has been calculated to be 19.6 cm. Therefore, the side is equal to:


s=19.62=19.61.41=13.90{\displaystyle s={\frac {19.6}{\sqrt {2}}}={\frac {19.6}{1.41}}=13.90}




, Return to the original formula to calculate the volume using the side and perpendicular height.V=13s2h{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}s^{2}h}


V=1313.92∗5{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}13.9^{2}*5}


V=13193.23∗5{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}193.23*5}


V=322.02cm3{\displaystyle V=322.02{\text{cm}}^{3}}

 You are used to that not-quite-even set of porch stairs, the wobbly railing, and sure footed as a goat on the icy walkway. However, your guests could end up hurting themselves if these things are not addressed. In the USA, you could unfortunately find yourself sued. Such safety issues include:


Make sure stairs are safe, or guests do not have access to them.
Fix anything that is not as it should be.
Make sure that walking surfaces are reasonably safe. This is especially important for those with limited mobility, such as those on crutches or the elderly. For example, be sure that ice has salt and sand placed down for traction.
Be sure to have adequate outdoor lighting.
Be extremely careful with swimming pools. Drownings are more likely to occur when alcohol is served. Also, young children are sometimes not monitored as carefully when parents are distracted.;
, Many dogs and cats enjoy company, and thrive on all of the attention. But having so many strangers can make pets frightened and anxious. It may be better to confine an animal to a crate, a bedroom, or the garage until the festivities are over.


If there will be small children, pets may get treated roughly.
Do not allow people to feed pets "people food". It is not good for them. Even more so for alcoholic beverages - many dogs like the taste of beer but it is not good for them. Unfortunately, some people enjoy trying to make animals inebriated.
Keep animals away from very loud noises. This includes loud music or fireworks. Your dog's hearing is much more sensitive than yours.
 This does not mean locking up the kitchen knives or taking down family photographs. But some things to consider:


Make sure firearms or other weaponry (such are archery equipment) are secured.
Medications should be discreetly put away. You may not want people to be able to easy see you are taking anti-depressives, or be able to steal your grandmother's painkillers.
Make sure bathroom medicine cabinets have nothing embarrassing in them. People do open these, whether it is to look for a cotton swab or for snooping.
Very valuable items. Unfortunately, sometimes people steal. It is unlikely your big-screen TV will be swiped during the party, but your grandfather's gold pocket-watch could be.

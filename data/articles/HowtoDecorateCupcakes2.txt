 Make sure the bag is cut far enough back that the end of the nozzle is clear of the piping bag. It needs to fit in the end, nice and snug and going nowhere.
 The part near the tip, that is. This will prevent any of the frosting coming out until you are ready. Place the piping bag into a glass and fold the top of the bag over the edge of the glass.


Don't question it. Just do. This will make everything much, much easier.
 Using the glass will allow you to fill the piping bag without needing two pairs of hands. If you don't, frosting will inevitably get everywhere (a delicious problem, but a problem nonetheless).


Note: Don't overfill the bag! About halfway is sufficient. If you do, extra frosting may start coming out the wrong end.
 This is just to make it easier --it stops all the frosting coming out of the top of the bag. You are now ready to start piping!


"Burp" the bag before you begin. That is, squeeze out some icing from the tip into a bowl -- you'll also get out the extra air that gets trapped in the end. If you don't, your first puff of icing will burst out like Ricky Martin in March of 2010.

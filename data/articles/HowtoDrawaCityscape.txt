 Only use straight lines going up and down, making buildings of many different sizes. Really try to have variety amongst your buildings, or else your cityscape will be pretty uninteresting.
 This will add depth and perspective to your cityscape; just make sure you keep everything in proportion and if you mess up, erase very carefully so as to not smudge any part of the other sketched row., If you add more rows of buildings, remember that the farther they are into the distance, the brighter the shade of grey they need to be., Use rectangles and squares to mimic the windows. Put many together in groups for larger buildings to make them look like apartments, and for warehouses and similar structures don't add any light at all.

, When you're done slicing you should have 1–1 1/2 tablespoons of garlic, and 2–3 tablespoons of ginger. Add to your cup., Add more if you prefer sweeter tea., This is optional, but does add a nice flavor., You don't have to worry about over-brewing the tea, but it will need to cool down before you drink it.

If your throat is sore, now is a great time to position your head over the tea and inhale the steam. This will increase circulation to your throat and sinus, therefore helping to make them heal quicker.
 Have it up to three times a day for very sore throats, and reuse the sliced ginger and garlic up to three times before slicing more.

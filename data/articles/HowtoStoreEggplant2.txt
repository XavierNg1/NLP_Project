 Place the whole, uncut eggplant in a perforated plastic bag, open plastic bag, or open plastic container.If desired, you could loosely wrap the eggplant in paper towels or paper bags before placing them into the plastic container. The paper should help absorb moisture from the eggplant, slowing decay as a result.
Do not seal the plastic bag or use plastic film to wrap the eggplant. Sealed plastic will restrict air flow to the vegetable, which may cause it to lose its freshness at a faster pace.
 Place the eggplant in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator.


If you cannot easily fit the eggplant in the crisper drawer, do not attempt to force it in since doing so could tear the skin and cause the flesh to spoil. You can simply sit the eggplant on another shelf inside the refrigerator.
 If possible, remove other fruits and vegetables from the crisper drawer while storing the eggplant.


Many fruits and vegetables produce ethylene gas. When eggplant comes into contact with these gases, it ripens and decays at a faster pace.
 Use refrigerated eggplant within three to seven days, if possible.Refrigerators are too cold for eggplants, so the resulting texture and color may change during refrigeration, even if you follow the procedure correctly. If you can use the eggplant within one or two days, room temperature storage is best.

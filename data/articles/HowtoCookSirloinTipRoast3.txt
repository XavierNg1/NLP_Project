 Place the potatoes on the bottom of the slow cooker, followed by the carrots, and topped by the onion.


Make sure that the potatoes have been cut into bite-size pieces and that the onion has been sliced or chopped. If using baby carrots, they can be left whole. If using larger carrots, cut into bite-size pieces.
The vegetables are layered according to the length of time required to cook them.
To limit the amount of mess during the cleanup stage, you can spray the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray before adding the vegetables or you can use a special slow cooker liner.
 Lay the roast directly on top of the vegetables. Sprinkle with garlic powder and pepper.


Note that you do not need to add any liquid to this recipe, even though liquid is recommended for most slow cooker recipes. The meat and vegetables should give off enough liquid to prevent the roast from drying out during the cooking process.
If, however, you want the meat to be even more moist, you can add 1/2 to 1 cup (125 to 250 ml) of water or beef broth to the contents of the slow cooker, as well.
 Cover the slow cooker and cook the contents for 2 hours on high heat.
 After the first 2 hours, reduce the heat to low and continue cooking for an additional 4 to 6 hours.


If you will not be home and able to switch the heat, you could simply cook the roast on low for 8 hours, instead.
When done, the roast should be cooked to well doneness and fork tender.
 Remove the roast from the slow cooker and cut into pieces across the grain. Scoop out the vegetables and serve them alongside the meat.

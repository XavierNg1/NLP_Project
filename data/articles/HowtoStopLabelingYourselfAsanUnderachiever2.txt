 It is quite possible that your feelings of underachievement are not entirely realistic. It is likely that you’ve merely gotten into a habit of seeing yourself this way. You can begin to recalibrate your sense of self by trying to get a sense of how your friends see you. Sit down with a few of your closest friends, one at a time, and ask them to describe your strengths and weaknesses. Implore them to be completely honest, and do your best to trust what they say., If you have labeled yourself an underachiever, you may be minimizing the ways you succeed. In fact, you likely don’t even notice when you receive a pat on the back. Every time someone in your life—a boss, a colleague, or a friend—gives you a compliment, jot it down, and repeat it to yourself later. In time, you will be able to accept the compliments you deserve, and in turn, improve the image you have of yourself., As with many things in life, altering deeply held self-perceptions is easier said than done. It will take commitment and daily practice. This process is sometimes best facilitated by a professional therapist, who can give you tools, assignments, and feedback to guide you. Consider speaking with a therapist to help your self-perceptions get back on track.

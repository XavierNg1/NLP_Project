 While the process of changing the name of a minor child is fairly similar to changing your name as an adult, certain restrictions apply. Make sure you are aware of these restrictions beforehand.


Both legal parents must consent to the name change.
If both parents do not consent, the custodial parent must prove to the court the child has not been substantially visited, contacted, or supported by the noncustodial parent for at least two years prior to filing the petition.
The non-custodial parent must be given legal notice of the hearing and a chance to object.
 The same petition for a legal name change must be filled out and filed. The petition will ask for:


The child's current name and the proposed changed name
The reasons for the name change
The name of the mother and the father
A signature and date, After the time, date, and place of the hearing is set notice must be published in the case of a minor child. This gives any non-custodial legal parents who could not be contacted legally the chance to object.


Notice must be published in a local newspaper and include the time, date, and place of the hearing.
If there is valid reason, such as concerns for personal safety, that the hearing not be announced publicly the court may order no publication is required.

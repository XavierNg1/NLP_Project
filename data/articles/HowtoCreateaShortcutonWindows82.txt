 Shortcuts are icons that allow you to quickly access files, folders, and programs that may be buried deep in a directory. The shortcut destination is referred to as the "target". Shortcuts are typically placed on the desktop, in the Start screen, or pinned to the taskbar, but they can be placed wherever you find them most convenient.
 You can hold Ctrl+⇧ Shift while moving a file or folder to create a shortcut instead of moving or copying the file. Releasing the target will create a shortcut in that location.
 If you want to quickly create a desktop shortcut for your target, you can do so from the right-click menu. Right-click on the target and select Send to → Desktop (create shortcut). The shortcut will appear on your desktop.


The shortcut will have "- Shortcut" added to the end of the name. You can remove this if you'd like.
 Right-click on the target and select Create shortcut. A shortcut will be created in the same location, which you can then move wherever you'd like.

 If you have a red blemish on your face, you want to use proper makeup to tone down the redness. A yellow color corrector is the most efficient at diminishing redness.








Use a makeup sponge to apply your concealer because using your finger transfers oils.
 After you’ve used your corrector on the blemish, you want to find a foundation that is the exact shade of your skin tone. You want it to look as natural as possible.









The idea that a dark concealer will hide your blemish better is just a myth., Use a dusting powder to offset any remaining oil. The powder should match your skin tone and you should stick to one layer of powder. Putting on extra layers of powder will cause you to look cakey.
 When you have blemishes that you’ve covered before you left the house, you should bring concealer with you when you leave. Especially if you have oily skin, you will need it for touch ups. Concealer is prone to fading on oily skin. To keep the blemishes hidden all day long, spot touch up with your concealer.

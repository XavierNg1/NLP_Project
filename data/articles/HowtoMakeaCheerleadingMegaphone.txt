 Tape the edges down where they meet- on the inside and the outside. The poster board will naturally form a cone shape.;
, Measure this length from the floor to the desired length and mark it on the poster board. Make more marks to this same height all the way around the top of the poster board. Cut around those marks to create the mouthpiece end of the megaphone. Repeat this along the bottom edge of the megaphone to create a nice opened end of your poster board cone.
 Following the package directions, dip each gauze strip into the water to activate the plaster and then apply each one, overlapping as you go, from top to bottom until you have covered the entire cone. Two layers of gauze are enough for a nice sturdy yet lightweight megaphone.
, To finish the top and bottom edges, cut several thinner strips of the plaster gauze, wet them down, and apply them over the edges.

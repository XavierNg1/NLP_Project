 If you do not have the funds available to pay the fees that you owe on the capias warrant, you may be able to borrow it. The easiest way to borrow would be a personal loan from a friend or relative. If you know people who could afford the amount in question, reach out to them to ask for a loan. You may need to offer a small amount of interest. You should have some expectation of being able to repay the loan fairly quickly.To avoid problems with the IRS, you should put the terms of the loan in writing. For short term loans, an interest rate of between 0.7% and 4% may be required.;
, Individuals are allowed to make gifts of up to $13,000 each year without paying a gift tax on the money. While your ability to find someone willing to give you this much money may be limited, it is an option to consider, which avoids tax consequences and can help you out of your immediate problems with the capias warrant., If you have built up some savings in a retirement account, you may be able to use some of that money to pay your capias fees. Ordinarily, money in a retirement account must remain there until you reach the age of 59 1/2 years old. However, if you can demonstrate a hardship need, you may be able to withdraw the funds you need.To get a hardship distribution, contact the individual at your place of work or the bank that manages your account. That person will be able to provide you with the necessary paperwork and the required terms for such withdrawals.
The IRS sets certain limitations on hardship withdrawals. You may only withdraw the amount that you need, and the withdrawal must be to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need. The amount you withdraw will be subject to income tax and an additional 10% tax penalty. However, to avoid further charges of court contempt and additional court fees and penalties on the capias warrant, this may be worthwhile.

 This method is bestÂ for hydrocarbons. To draw the net:


Draw an equilateral triangle on a piece of paper. Start by drawing a line of the length you want, then use a protractor to measure a 60 degree angle from one end. Draw another line at 60 degrees to your first line. Then join up the other ends to make a triangle.
Add three more triangles on the edges of your first triangle (these must be the same size as the original.)
Put one tab on one edge of each outer triangle (all of them except the centre one.)
Cut it out.;
, Put glue on the top of each tab, then fold it into a tetrahedron (as indicated by the image).

For a CH3 group, count one of the corners as a carbon and the other three as hydrogens. The image shows ethane, CH3CH3. Touching corners indicate a carbon-carbon bond.
For a CH2 group, have one edge of each tetrahedron touch the edge of another tetrahedron. This represents a double bond. If you use two tetrahedrons, you have ethene (CH2=CH2.)
For a CH group, have one face of one tetrahedron touch one face of another tetrahedron. This represents a triple bond. Using two tetrahedrons, you will have acetylene/ethyne (HCCH)

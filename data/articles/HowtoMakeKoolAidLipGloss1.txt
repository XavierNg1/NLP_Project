 Let the mixture cool a little bit before adding the powder, as it will dissolve better.The Kool-Aid gives the lip gloss color and flavor, so pick a color that you'll like on your lips. Some good options are Strawberry Kiwi, Cherry, and Tropical Fruit Punch. How much Kool-Aid you add depends on how deep a color you want.








If you want a very dark lip balm, you can divide the petroleum jelly into six smaller pots and add one packet per pot. You may end up with grainier lip balm with this method.
For a smoother lip balm, add one to two packets of Kool-Aid to the whole bowl of of petroleum jelly. Some people use one packet per cup of petroleum jelly.You can also add a bit of sweetener or sugar to the mix to make it taste less bitter.;
, You'll need about 4 big spoonfuls. Add it to a microwave-safe bowl. Heat it up in the microwave, starting with 30 seconds. The petroleum jelly will eventually melt completely, forming a thick liquid.








As you heat it, take it out every 30 seconds to stir it, until it's completely melted. Stirring it will help it melt more evenly., Use a fork or whisk to thoroughly incorporate the mixture. This step may take a while, but it's very important. You need to mix it thoroughly so that it's not grainy. You may need to keep mixing it for a few minutes.








Some people add a tiny bit of water to help get Kool-Aid dissolved.
If you add water, you may need to pour some of it back out or add in some extra petroleum jelly after stirring it for a bit.
 You may need a small funnel for this step. You'll also need several small containers to put the lip gloss in. You can find small screw-top containers at the drug store in the travel section, and you may also be able to find some at the craft store. Divide up the liquid into as many containers as it takes.Spoon it from the top, as it will be less grainy at the top.You can also pour from the top, leaving the Kool-Aid sediment in the bottom.

 Place the cashews in the small saucepan and the water. Bring to the boil. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes to soften the cashews. Remove from the pan and drain. Rinse the cashews., Add all of the other ingredients (including the 1 cup of water) as well. Blend until smooth and watery. The cashews shouldn't be noticeable anymore; if your blender isn't powerful enough to completely blend them, strain the mixture before heating., Heat on medium-high heat and stir continuously. After about 5 minutes, it will congeal, which is the consistency you're after. Keep stirring and cook for another minute to firm it. Remove from the heat. Divide into three portions for use in the sandwich., Spread the vegan butter/spread on each slice of bread. Arrange one portion of mozzarella cheese on each of three slices. Place the other three slices on top, keeping the buttered sides facing outward., Heat over medium heat. Place each sandwich into the pan and grill until golden brown. Flip over and do the same for the other side of each sandwich. It's a good idea to press the sandwiches down with a spatula to spread the cheese and ensure that the cheese is heated right through., Serve immediately. This goes well with a hot sauce or ketchup.

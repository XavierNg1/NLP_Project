 A private lender is an individual with liquid money to spare who is willing to lend you money at a predetermined interest rate.Unlike a real estate partner who splits the profits with you, a private lender will simply charge you an interest rate before providing you with the cash. In many cases, the interest rates for a private lender are lower than a hard money lender. However, a private lender might be more difficult to find., In many cases you can find a private lender through your own social network. If you know of a relative, friend, or coworker who has liquid cash just sitting around, you might be able to borrow this money and pay them interest. In an ideal scenario, everybody wins: your lender will be able to earn some extra interest, and you will be able to make a profit from your flipped house., If you are going to secure a private lender, be sure that both you and your lender are aware of the potential risks of this transaction. Consider what might happen if you do not profit from the flipped house. Will you still be able to make your interest payments? Think through your options before seeking a private lender. In order to preserve your relationship with that person, you will have to pay them back in a timely way.
 Do not take advantage of a private lender if you want to continue working with them.Trust is the key ingredient of private loans, and you have to demonstrate that you can hold up your end of the bargain. If you are successful, your private lender might be willing to help you finance future real estate investments.

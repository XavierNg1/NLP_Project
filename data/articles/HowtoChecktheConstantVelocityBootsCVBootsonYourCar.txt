 These shafts connect the wheels to the car's transmission.
 These are the constant velocity boots, or CV boots. There are four in all.
 Cracks, rips, tears, splits or punctures all will permit the packing grease to leak out, while also letting dirt and moisture in. Also look for loose or missing clamps.
 If you detect grease, rub it between your fingers. If the grease feels gritty, it has been contaminated with dirt, and so has the CV joint. The joint itself needs to be inspected, cleaned and repacked with fresh grease; this is usually best handled by a mechanic.

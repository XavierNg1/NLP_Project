 Lysine is an amino acid that some studies have shown to help treat and prevent cold sore outbreaks by blocking arginine, which is another amino acid that is required for viral growth.Lysine-rich foods include fish, meat (poultry, lamb, beef), dairy products, mung bean sprouts, and beans.You can also take a lysine supplement. The dosage is usually 500-1000 mg every day taken on an empty stomach. The safe limit of lysine is less than 3000 mg a day, so donâ€™t take any more than the recommended dosage.;
, Arginine is also an amino acid, but one that serves as a building block for the herpes virus, helping it to spread. The highest concentrations of arginine are found in whole grains, seeds, nuts and chocolate.
 This is particularly important if they will come in contact with the cold sore should you eat them. The herpes virus thrives in an acidic environment, so it is important to keep all acid away from the sores. Acidic foods to avoid include citrus fruits, tomatoes and anything with vinegar.
 Zinc may help boost your immune system and help prevent future cold sores. The recommended dose to boost your immune system is 10 mg/day for adult men and women.For children, consult their pediatrician.


There are also zinc creams that you can use. An example is Virunderim gel, which contains 10% zinc sulfate.You can use this for up to twelve days at the first symptoms of a cold sore to help minimize the duration.
 Include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables in your diet daily. Some of the best choices for boosting the immune system are cauliflower, cabbage, brussels sprouts, broccoli, onion and garlic.

 A small pot or tea kettle will work fine. Add 8-10 ounces (one cup or a little more) of water per mug of coffee you desire.









Bring the water just to boiling -- bubbling regularly but not vigorously.;
, of water. Stir just enough to help the coffee grounds circulate.









Use a standard drip coffee grind.
Try 2 tablespoons per mug at first. It is easier to weaken coffee that is too strong by diluting it than it is to strengthen coffee that is too weak.
You can use instant coffee if desired. You will add 1-2 teaspoons per mug instead (refer to package directions).
 Let it rest for 2-3 minutes.









Some people prefer to bring the mixture back up to a boil briefly,or even for up to 2 minutes.This will increase the bitterness of your brew, so know your taste in coffee before deciding.
 This wait not only steeps the coffee in the water (longer wait = stronger coffee), it also allows the coffee grounds to settle on the bottom of the pot.









Splashing a little cold water into the pot at the end may help the grounds settle at the bottom. Flicking drops off your wet fingertips should suffice for a single mug size brew.
 Pour slowly not only because the coffee is still quite hot, but because you want to leave most of the grounds -- now more like a brown sludge -- in the pot. Leave the last bit of the brew in the pot to trap most of the sludge there.









If you have a tea strainer or similar filter, you can place it over your mug to help keep out even more of the sludge and rogue grounds.

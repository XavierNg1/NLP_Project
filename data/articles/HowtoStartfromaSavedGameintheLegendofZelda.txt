 When you boot up Legend of Zelda on the NES you should load onto the Title Screen. Pressing Start will take you to the next screen.;
, After getting past the start screen you should be taken to the select screen. There will be 3 game slots. You'll notice that there will be a heart next to the top slot, which means that's the slot that you currently have connected.


If you see the file that you want to load, use the select key on your controller to move the heart to the file you want to load.
If there are no saved files, you will have to register a new slot and start the game over as you will be unable to load the game from a previous point.
The registered slots will have names next to the little icon of link.
 Once you have your heart icon next to the saved file that you want to load, you just press the "Start" button on your NES controller. This will load the file, and you should start the game from your last save.

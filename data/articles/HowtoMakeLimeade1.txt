 To get the most out of your limes, roll them across the counter while gently pressing down on them with your palm.;
, The pitcher should be large enough to hold at least 6 cups (1.5 liters) of liquid. This will include the lime juice, sugar, and ice.
 Your standard granulated sugar will work just fine, but superfine or castor sugar (not powdered) will work even better because it dissolves easier. Keep in mind that, because you are not cooking the sugar, you may end up with a few un-dissolved grains at the bottom of your pitcher.


Be sure to stir the sugar well to help it dissolve.
For a twist, try â…” cup (150 grams) of white sugar and 2 tablespoons (45 grams) of honey instead., Since every one has different tastes, it might be a good idea to add the water 1 cup (240 milliliters) at a time, and tasting the limeade after each cup you add; be sure to stir the limeade well after each addition. You may find that the limeade is just right after only 4 cups (1 liter) of water.


If the limeade is still too sweet or too strong for you, you can add another cup (240 milliliters) of water.
 Avoid adding the ice directly into the pitcher, because the ice will dilute the limeade as it melts. Instead, add the ice into the glasses first, then pour the limeade over the ice.

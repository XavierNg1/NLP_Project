Raw soybeans will not require soaking. Simply place them in a large pot of water, and follow the boiling process as described above. Like dried soybeans, after the raw beans have simmered for 2 to 3 hours and have been dehulled, allow them to cool.
The room temperature soybeans can then be used in the recipes of your choice.

 Count out the number of bands you'll need for your bracelet. This bracelet is a little thicker than the basic bracelet, so you'll probably need around 30 bands for a child's bracelet and around 40 for an adult's bracelet. You will also need one C-clip or S-clip.


If you don't want to work on your fingers, you can use unsharpened pencils, knitting needles, or even chopsticks to hold the bands.The process is the same no matter what you use.Just hold the pencils in your non-dominant hand and work with your dominant hand.
Using two (or more!) colors of bands will bring out the fishtail design better than using only one.
 Twist it in the middle to form an "infinity" or "8" shape. Be careful not to stretch the bands too much. They might snap if overstretched.
 Don't twist these bands; just place them on top of the first one. You won't twist any more of the bands from here on out.


If you're using two or more colors, make sure to alternate the colors of the bands as you wrap them.
 Bring it to the middle of the bands (halfway between your fingers) and release. Next, pull the bottom loom band on your index finger over the top band. Bring it to the middle and release.
 This will help keep your bracelet from coming undone as you work.
 Repeat Step 4. Keep adding bands and repeating Step 4 until you have made the size you want.
 This will complete the loop. Now you have a beautiful fishtail bracelet!


You can modify this method to make a ring or a necklace -- just weave fewer or more bands until it's the length you want and then connect the ends with the plastic clip.

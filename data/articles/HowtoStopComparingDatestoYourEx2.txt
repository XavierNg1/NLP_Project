 It’s no wonder you’re holding on to the past—memories of your ex are all around you. If you’re still holding on to mementos, looking at old photographs, or visiting their favorite restaurant with the hope of an “accidental” meeting, you need to stop. The only way you can move on is by putting this person in your past.Go through any mementos to decide if you really need to keep these items. Box up those you can’t bear to give away and donate or trash the rest.
Stop going to places hoping to bump into your ex.
 Maybe you can’t stop comparing because you haven’t quite cleared this person from your conscience. You can “let go” by writing them a letter to say all the things you never got around to saying. Don’t mail the letter, though. Read it aloud and then rip it to shreds., If your thoughts sound like a non-stop reel of “woulda, shoulda, coulda” you may be stuck in the past. It’s impossible to move on and really fall for a new person if you’re still examining everything that went wrong in a previous relationship.Slide a rubber band onto your wrist and snap it each time you catch yourself dwelling on the past relationship.
You can also try distracting yourself with another activity like reading, watching a TV show, or calling a friend.
Another way to reduce the amount of time you spend ruminating is by scheduling sessions to do this. Dedicate 15 minutes to thinking about the ex. Then, in a few days, reduce the window to 10 minutes. Then, five.
 Although this may be hard to hear, you may be falling prey to comparisons because it’s too soon for you to start dating again. Make sure the emotional wounds of the previous relationship are completely healed before starting up something new. That way, you’ll be able to begin a new relationship with objectivity and you’ll be much less likely to fall for an unhealthy partner.

 Clean food preparation surfaces - such as cutting boards and countertops - with a disinfecting spray or hot, soapy water. Wash all dishes and utensils thoroughly, and do not overlook surfaces like the sink or refrigerator shelves and handles in general kitchen cleaning.
 E. coli bacteria can be transmitted through fecal matter (including dirty diapers), so maintaining a clean toilet and bathroom sink can be essential to preventing E. coli poisoning. Wash all surfaces (including the toilet flush mechanism, sink handles, and door knobs) with antibacterial soaps or wipes designed to kill E. coli bacteria.
 Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before and after handling food, after using the restroom or changing a diaper, and after handling animals. Encourage others to do the same by reminding kids to wash hands after using the toilet or before eating food.

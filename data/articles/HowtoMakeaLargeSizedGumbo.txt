 The roux is the most important part of making gumbo, you just can't mess it up. The way to do it is to add 3 to 4 cups of cooking oil into a pan above medium-high stove, then add in the flour.


Do not let the flour get stuck on the bottom, you should have a pretty watery mixture.;
, Basically cook until the roux becomes a caramel-y color.
 Now is the fun part. Take the roux off the fire when it is the correct color, then transfer it into a larger pot, depending on how much you make. Then you get all the vegetables (celery, onion, bell pepper, garlic) and add them into the mix. This should all be happening above medium-low heat, and again let it simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until the vegetables are nice and tender.


Okra will go in later because it is quite easy to burn.
 Wait until the bouillon has dissolved into the roux. Now's the time to add in the 3 quarts of water. If it looks a little watery, don't worry, it gets thicker after time.
 Let it simmer for around an hour, and at the 45 minute mark, add in about one tablespoon of the gumbo file powder.
 Stir for a while, and add in whatever kinds of meat you want to put in your gumbo. Also, don't forget to add the Worcestershire sauce while this is going on.
 Just before the time is up, add in the last tablespoon of the gumbo file powder. Remove from the heat and serve as soon as possible.

 Get your hands on a trumpet, guitar, or trombone, and make a few notes. It won't be music yet, but it'll give you some idea of whether or not the instrument is fun to play, and worth spending some time with.


Typically, if you want to sign up for band or orchestra at your school, call-outs are regularly held during which the directors allow you to experiment with instruments and select one. Go to one of these call-outs and check out all the different kinds of instruments.
Most instrument stores are excited to share their instruments with you and let you give them a shot. They might even be able to show you a few things.
 If you're starting out in a school band, check and see what instruments the band includes. Most concert bands in schools have clarinets, flutes, saxophones, tubas, baritones, trombones, trumpets, and percussion as starter instruments, and let you advance to other instruments like oboe, bassoon, and horn later on.


You can begin making your decision from the instruments that are available. You can also ask the director which instruments they are short ofâ€”he or she will be very grateful if you can fill an empty spot.
 You may want to play the baritone sax, but the band already has three players. You may have to first start on the clarinet, then move to alto sax, and finally switch to bari when a slot opens up.
 If you're starting out in middle school, and smaller than the average student, a tuba or trombone may not be the right instrument for you. You could try trumpet or cornet instead.


If you're younger or still losing teeth, you may find it hard to play some brass instruments because your teeth aren't very strong yet.
If you have small hands or fingers, the bassoon may not be for you, although there are bassoons made for beginners with some keys for small hands.
Think of how braces will affect your tone, especially for most brass. Find out whether you'll need them, or when any current braces will come off.

 Keep them well watered, but not soaked. The soil should always have a little moisture.


Water the plants early in the day so the leaves have time to dry in the sun before nightfall. Leftover moisture on the leaves can lead to diseases.
Make sure the plants are especially well-watered when they are in flower.
 After about five weeks, the potato stalks will have grown several inches above the soil. Create "hills" by mounding soil over the stalks. You can cover them completely or allow the very top of the stalks to peek through. New potatoes will grow just under the soil, above the seeds potatoes that were planted earlier.


If you planted the potatoes in rows, your "hills" should be connected to make long ridges. If you planted the potatoes in one circular mound, you should end up creating one big hill.
As the stalks continue to grow, hill the potatoes every 2 - 3 weeks. Each time you add another layer to the hill, another layer of potatoes will grow just underneath the surface of the soil.

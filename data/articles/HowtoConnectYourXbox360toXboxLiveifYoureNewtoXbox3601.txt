 The 360 Slim and new E models both have wireless adapters built-in, or can be connected through Ethernet. The original 360 model has an Ethernet port, but needs a wireless adapter in order to connect to a Wi-Fi network.
, If you are using a wired connection to your network, use an Ethernet cable to connect your Xbox 360 to your router. As long as your home network has been set up correctly, that is all you need to do.
 When you are on the Dashboard, press the Guide button (the center Xbox button). Select Settings, then System Settings, and then Network Settings. Under Wired Network, select Test Xbox LIVE Connection.
 If you are using a wireless adapter, connect it to the back of the console via USB and flip the antenna(s) up. You should see a green light when it is functioning. Select Settings from the Dashboard, and then System Settings. Select Network Settings and under Wireless Network, you can choose your routerâ€™s name.
 After entering your password, the 360 will automatically attempt to connect to Xbox LIVE.

 Praise her and reassure her that no harm will be done. Act as normal as possible. If necessary, go about your day so she doesn't sense that something is going on.


If you have another person with you, this will be a lot easier. Distract that cat yourself while the other person grabs the towel or blanket to wrap them with. Have them approach from behind.
 You want that's ideally three or four times the size of the cat. A large blanket, towel, or sheet is best. Avoid those that have a loose weave, as your cat could paw or claw her way out.


You'll also need a towel or blanket resting smooth on a large, flat surface. The towel in your hands now is to cover her and to keep her from clawing you and escaping. The towel on the table will be the one she is wrapped in.
 Try to get the cat as centered in the towel as possible. Restrain her as necessary -- you won't hurt her if your aim is simply restraint.


If you miss, you may be better off waiting for the shock to wear off. For the next hour or so, she'll probably be on high alert. Try again when she seems calmer.
 This needs to happen while the cat is still inside the towel. Grab it using both of your hands, if necessary.If she's behaving, use your non-dominant hand. Your dominant hand will be used for wrapping.


Being grabbed by the scruff of the neck won't hurt her. In fact, it's where mother cats grab their kittens. It signals to the kittens that they should be passive and docile.
 Follow the same procedure as in wrapping a cat that is calm, only complete it as quickly as possible. When the wrapping is complete, you can then immediately medicate her or examine her as needed.


The first method in this article outlines the three-move, or "burrito," wrapping method. You'll be ready to start at step 3.

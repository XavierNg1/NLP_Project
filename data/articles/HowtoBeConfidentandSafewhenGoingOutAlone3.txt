 Remember that there is no designated driver - you're it. Be aware of what you are drinking. Do not leave your drink unattended for any reason. If someone buys you a drink, make sure you watch the bartender pour it. If you suspect your drink has been compromised, do NOT drink it. Don't get drunk! If you do get drunk, don't plan on going home without calling a taxi or relative to collect you.


Just a reminder: if you're out completely alone, it's not not a good idea to get too drunk or someone will take advantage of you. But if you're walking out to meet friends, that's okay.
 Take a close read of the street and then go straight to your car, then home. Alone. If the guard or bouncer, or a group of other women you have met, offer to walk you to your car, take them up on it. At the very least, let someone know that you're going home now, and ask them to watch you till you get in your car.


Take a look around - know who is on the street with you, and if you see an alley between you and your car, walk in the middle of the street if necessary to give yourself plenty of room to move if you need to.
Walk purposefully and confidently to your car, and when you get there, have your keys ready and unlock the car as you are taking your last steps toward it. As you approach the car do a quick visual check that nobody is inside of it. Get in, lock the doors immediately, buckle up, start your car and drive away. Don't sit in your car fixing your make-up or fiddling with your iPad or texting someone - get going.

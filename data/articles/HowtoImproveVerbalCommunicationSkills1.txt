, All skills take practice, and good conversation skills are no different.If you have a big speech to give or an important conversation coming up, it can be helpful to practice it with yourself in the mirror beforehand. This way, you'll at least have a run through in your mind already before you attempt the real thing. And it will help you work out any possible problems that may arise (in your argument, stumbling over words, etc.).
 The more you know about a topic, the better you'll be at talking about that topic. Reading will help you enhance your knowledge and will boost your diction in the process.

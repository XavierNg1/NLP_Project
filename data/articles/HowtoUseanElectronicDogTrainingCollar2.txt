 Advocates for the use of electronic collars state that the collars give a small electrical shock, similar to a shock from static build up, that does not hurt the dog.They also argue that these collars can actually give dogs quite a bit of freedom, as you will have a way to control your dog when it is off leash.There is some debate among those that use electronic collars about what the collars should be used for. Some argue that the collars should only be used on dogs that have severe behavior problems, for instance to change behavior that could get a dog put down. There are others that use the collars for correcting behavior, such as if a dog gets into a garden bed the owner will turn on the collar to teach the dog that this behavior is bad. There are others still that use the collar to signal a dog to do positive behaviors, such as sitting, staying, or lying down., Those opposed to the use of these collars state that there is a great chance of misuse and abuse when using a shock collar.In addition, opponents argue that other training systems, such as simple positive reinforcement of behavior, can be just as effective.While positive reinforcement makes the training about the dog's choice of behavior, positive punishment with a shock collar forces a dog to choose between pain and behavior.
 Make the decision for yourself whether you think an electronic collar will help your dog learn what they shouldn't do. If you do decide to use it, make sure to follow the manufactures instructions and use the collar properly, not as punishment but to reinforce behavior.

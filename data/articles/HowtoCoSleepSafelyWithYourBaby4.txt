You can do this by sleeping in the same bed or sleeping in the same room.Room-sharing is when there is a crib, bassinet, or cot in the room near the bed. Bedside sleepers that are attached to the bed are also popular. The parents have easy access to the baby.
Bed-sharing is when the baby sleeps in the same bed.
 Bed-sharing is a controversial topic. Some people think it encourages breastfeeding, helps promote sleep for the parents and baby, and increases closeness. However, some organizations advise against it because bed-sharing can increase the risk of suffocation, strangulation, and SIDS.You should weigh the pros and cons and decide if bed-sharing is something you believe would benefit you and your baby.
Co-sleeping is not for everyone. You have to figure out if it fits your lifestyle.
 You should never co-sleep with your baby before discussing it with your partner. You and your partner should both agree to co-sleeping. You both should also agree that you both are equally responsible for the baby, not that only one parent is responsible.Donâ€™t put the baby in a bed if your partner is asleep and unaware that the baby is in the bed.

 Don't bend the area between the arch and demi-pointe area; this will weaken the shoe's support. Do some releves from demi pointe to pointe. To soften them even more, put one shoe on, but leave the heel off and folded all the way down. Take hold of the heel of the shank (the hard "sole" of the shoe) and push it down and in to your exact arch. If you feel uncertain about this, ask a teacher to do it the first time. However, if you use only a little pressure, it will not hurt the shoe.
 This makes it wider and more comfortable for your toes. Do not use harsh pressure, or extreme methods such as hammering them, unless you are very experienced! This will likely cause the shoe to crack or break and be weak in areas. Some common "pressure points" for dancers en pointe are the bunion bone area (side of the big toe joint) and the tailors bunion (side of the pinky to joint). If you find those areas to rub or press to much, try dabbing a little rubbing alcohol on them, working them with your fingers, then allowing them to mould around your foot while drying.
 If you are not experienced you may end up damaging the shoes. The best way to break in shoes is by dancing in them. As you become more experienced, you will be able to figure out how to break in your shoes more easily.

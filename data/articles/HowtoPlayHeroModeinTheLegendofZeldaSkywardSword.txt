 In Hero Mode, you take double damage from enemies, and you won't find hearts in the overworld. The only way to heal damage is from the use of potions, fairies, and sitting on tree stumps.;
, With double damage and lack of hearts in the overworld, the punishment for messing up is more severe, so you should know how to deal with the enemies and bosses before going into Hero Mode.
 Once the credits are finished rolling, you'll be asked if you want to continue in Hero Mode. Say "yes" and then say "yes" again when it asks you if you want to overwrite the current file with a Hero Mode file.
 Enter your character's name. The character name from the previous file will be entered in by default, but you can change the name if you want.
 Among other things, you'll be able to skip cutscenes (which you'll want to do if you've already viewed them). Also, bugs and treasure from your previous file will be carried into the new file (so you can collect more of them in the new file). Additionally, you'll be able to face all of the bosses in the game's Lightning Round (allowing you to get the Hylian Shield as soon as you get there for the first time). Furthermore, once you get the Master Sword, you'll get an instant charge for the Skyward Strike.
 Don't just go in and swing your sword aimlessly. Many enemies require precise sword strikes to damage, so be prepared and have a strategy in mind.
 Though being cautious is important to surviving Hero Mode, along with getting the most out of the mode, the most important thing is to have fun. As hard as Hero Mode is, the challenge will be better for you if you're having fun with it.

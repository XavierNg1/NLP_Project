 Choose the color you want the tree to be as you won't be able to color the felt.
 You can use a freehand drawing of a tree or you can copy or trace a template from the internet or a book. Cut out the template.
 Pin in place to stop it from moving when you cut out the tree shape.
 Use sharp scissors suitable for fabric.
 If you want to add fruit, blossom, birds, leaves, etc., decide how you'll do this. A very simple way is to glue on felt pieces cut to the shapes. A more imaginative way is to use things like buttons, ribbon, embroidered patches, etc. Glue or sew the items where you'd like.
 Sew or glue the cutout tree to such projects as a quilt, blanket, toys, gift boxes, scrapbooks, etc. It can also be used for Christmas decorating if cut in the shape of traditional Christmas trees.

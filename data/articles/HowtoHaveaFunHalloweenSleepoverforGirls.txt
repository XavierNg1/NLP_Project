 They shouldn't mind much. Explain you won't keep them up all night and you won't be a bother to them. You might think this is pointless, but if you put yourself in their shoes, it wouldn't be too good trying to sleep with a bunch of racket coming from the room next door.;
, You should only invite up to four or five, but a lot of the time, it can be easier for your parents and more fun for you if you keep it at two to three girls. Also, if you plan on doing any partner activities, invite an even number of friends so no one is left out.
 Use black paper as a backing and cover the main text paper with tea and put it in the oven. Burn holes in it if you wish. This will give it a spooky, old look. Wrap your invite in the fake cobweb you can get in places like Tesco and, if you live in the US, Walmart will probably sell them. Add a couple of spiders for a real effect.
 Try mixing drinks like Fanta and Cherry Ale with Coke and Lemonade. Add an ice hand to make a bit of a stir. Look in the recipe book "Roald Dahl's Book Of Revolting Recipes" for more recipes. Serve sweets if you don't want to go trick or treating - but trick or treating is a great way to fill time at a sleepover, and for most people is a tradition. When you return, spill all your treats on your bedroom floor. High sugar levels are good for you at sleepovers but not so good for parents. Don't get too hyper.

Sno-caps- Each person gets a straw and a cup. Everyone gets in a circle around a plate in the middle. The host pours Sno-caps on the plate. Everyone rolls a die and tries to get a 6. If a person gets a 6, she tries to pick up as much Sno-caps as she can with her straw and puts them in her cup until another person rolls a 6. That person repeats the process.

 Halloween is one holiday where you can't overdo the decorations. Discount stores have a large selection of creepy decorations for the holiday, many of them animated, lighted or with eerie sound effects. Fake spider web is a cheap way to add a creepy touch all over your house. Invest in a CD of spooky Halloween sound effects to play during the evening, or you can always:

 People who are narcissistic tend to consider themselves to be better than other people and this kind of attitude is often easy to recognize.Pay attention to the things that people say and do and consider whether the person seems to have a higher opinion of him or herself than is appropriate. You might notice that the person:


seems to live in a fantasy world where he or she has unlimited power, ideal love, beauty, or success.
claims to be special or important and only wishes to associate with other people who he or she deems special or important.
behaves in an arrogant way, such as by making rude remarks or commenting about being superior to other people.
 People who are narcissistic think very highly of themselves, but they also expect people to praise them endlessly.If you encounter someone who gets upset if you do not focus all of your attention on how intelligent, accomplished, beautiful, or otherwise valuable he or she is, then this might be a narcissist.


For example, the person might purposely talk about accomplishments, small or large, and he or she might sulk if you do not provide the praise that he or she desires.
 People who are narcissistic often treat other people poorly. If you meet someone who treats you poorly or who you have noticed treats other people poorly, then this person may be a narcissist. Some behaviors to watch for include:Exploiting or taking advantage of other people.

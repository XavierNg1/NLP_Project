 Tell everyone about the fake profile floating around. If you want to, put a watermark, which is basically just a phrase or name that shows that the picture belongs to a specific person, on the pictures you post from then on.;
, Minimize search criteria to as be as specific as possible. For example, if you're a girl living in the state of Minnesota with brown hair, and you know the person who stole your info didn't bother to change the state, narrow your search results to the state of Minnesota. If their profile says they live in a different country, like Turkey for example, minimize your results to the country of Turkey. This may take some time, so be patient.
 Nicely. Once you find the profile, send them a message stating who you are and your purpose. Tell them to take your pictures off the profile, or you will report them to the admin of the site.
 If they refuse to take the profile down, contact Facebook support directly via email. On most sites, there is a "Report this Person" button, or something similar.
 Try to make it as high quality as possible, and don't post it, because the impersonator could easily steal it. Instead, send the pic to an admin address.

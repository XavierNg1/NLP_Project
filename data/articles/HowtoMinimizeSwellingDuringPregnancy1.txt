 As swelling often occurs around the feet and ankles, take care in how you treat your feet during pregnancy. Select proper footwear and ask your doctor about compression stockings.


Your healthcare provider may be able to recommend a brand of tight, compression stockings during the day. Such stockings can help reduce swelling and provide needed support to your legs during pregnancy.You should also be careful about what kind of shoes you wear. Tight fitting shoes or heels can restrict blood flow to the feet, making swelling and related pain worse. Stick with comfortable, loose-fitting flats and tennis shoes.;
, Pressing a cold compress to the swollen areas can help reduce swelling and lessen the pain. You can use a cold washcloth, a bag of ice wrapped in a paper towel, or buy an ice pack at the supermarket. Remember, ice and store-bought ice packs should never go directly on the skin. Make sure you wrap it in a cloth or paper towels before use., Resting your feet during pregnancy can also help lessen pain and swelling. Make sure you stay off your feet and know the proper ways to rest your legs after a long day.


Try not to stand for too long. If you have a job that requires you to be on your feet for long hours, talk to your boss about making accommodations during your pregnancy.When you get a chance to sit down, elevate your feet and occasionally roll the ankles. If possible, lie down with your feet elevated., Standing or walking in shallow pool can help compress the tissues in your legs and ankles. For some women, this seems to reduce pain and swelling. If you do not have a pool, consider buying a plastic child's pool from the store and filling it with cool water.

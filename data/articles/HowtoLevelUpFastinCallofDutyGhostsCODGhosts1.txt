 For players who prefer fast paced game modes with high experience points (XP) rewards, Cranked is surely the game mode for you. Every time you gets a kill, you also get a timer (30 seconds) before self-detonation. Timer will only reset if you get another kill. This eliminates the benefits of camping and definitely promotes fast paced combat - thus, more kills and XP.


When you get a timer (cranked), you also gain perks such as Ready Up, Sleight of Hand, Agility, Marathon, and QuickDraw.
You get double XP on every kill you get while youâ€™re cranked.
Remember, you cannot damage enemies nor allies when you self-detonate.
It is advisable for you to use light weapons in this mode. Avoid using heavy weapons for this mode really requires you to move fast or you will be an easy target.;
, Based on a popular tactical multiplayer mode Search and Destroy, comes Search and Rescue. Teams take turn defending their spot on the map and players can also confirm or deny kills by collecting dog tags of enemies or allies. This mode offers more XP for kills and completing objectives so it is a mode truly for ranking up.


In this mode, you get a whopping 250 XP for each kill. Not only that, each kill confirm/deny also rewards you 250 XP.
Planting or diffusing bombs reward 500 XP.
Unlike Cranked, this mode is very much tactical and does not require rushing in. So make sure you position yourself wisely and land those kills.

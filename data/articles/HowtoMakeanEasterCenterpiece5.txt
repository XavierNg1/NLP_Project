 As with glass bowls, clear glass jars can serve as a wonderful inspiration for centerpieces. Either fill with spring flowers and sprinkle eggs around of try one of the following suggestions:


Try adding a full chocolate bunny sitting on Easter grass in the middle of a large Mason jar. This can look stunning on its own.
Make alternating layers of Easter candies that fill to the top of the Mason jar.
Make a bed of candies, then some Easter grass, and then an Easter figurine or chocolate animal seated on top.

 When it is between 20 and 40 years old, it is likely that you tree will start to show clear signs of aging.


Each branch has only a few leaves.
If viewed from above, the tree's crown will appear to have a gap in the center.
 Eliminate the mother branch, the one that blocks sunlight from coming through.


Search for the straightest branch; this will be the mother branch that should be eliminated. Remove it with a saw, using an angled cut.
 In doing this, you will guarantee that the mother branch is no more than 12 to 15 years old.


Keep in mind that after cutting off the mother branch, the first year's production will decrease by about 25%. However, the following year, you will see an increase in production, recuperating that 25% and more.
If you perform this cycle correctly, you will prolong the life of your olive tree.

 Gather parsley before the first flowers start to open, and gather it in the morning after the dew has dried. It will have maximum flavor at this time of day; the heat of the afternoon will diminish the parsley's flavor. Alternately, purchase fresh parsley at a grocery store. Choose bright green bunches of parsley that look nice and smell fresh. Don't pick parsley that is shriveled, brown, moldy, or is dried out. Carefully cut the parsley with stems still attached, and be careful to not bruise the leaves.
 Use cold water to rinse, and then shake gently to remove excess water from the leaves. This will remove any residual dirt, as well as any bugs that crawled into your parsley.
 If the parsley has contact with the metal cookie sheet, it can darken the parsley's color.
 This will ensure adequate air-flow around the cookie sheet while the parsley is drying.
 It should dry within 2-4 hours.
 Keep it in a cool, dry place.

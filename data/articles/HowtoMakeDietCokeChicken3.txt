 Lightly sprinkle salt and pepper over both sides of each chicken breast.


It's generally best to use small amounts of salt and pepper. Start with 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) each or less, divided amongst the entire 1 lb (450 g) of chicken.
While not strictly necessary, you could place a slow cooker liner inside the slow cooker for an easier cleanup. If you are unable to find liners, you could lightly coat the bottom and sides with nonstick cooking spray instead.
 Lay the seasoned chicken in the bottom of the slow cooker first, followed by the onions and bell peppers. Try to keep the layers even.


You can use red, yellow, or green peppers for this recipe, or some combination of the three. Alternatively, you can omit the peppers completely if you don't like the taste.
You can mix the peppers and onions together, but the chicken should remain as the bottom layer. Since the heating element of the slow cooker is located in the bottom, the foods requiring the longest cooking time should be placed at the bottom.
 Evenly pour the barbecue sauce over the chicken, then evenly poor the diet cola on top of that.


There's no need to mix the two sauce ingredients together before placing them in the slow cooker.
If you don't like the taste of barbecue sauce, you could use ketchup instead.The final dish will have a milder flavor.
 Cover the slow cooker and switch it on. If using the "low" setting, cook the chicken for to 8 hours. If using the "high" setting, cook it for 3 to 4 hours.Do not open the lid while the chicken cooks. Doing so will release some of the built-up heat and may result in an increased cooking time.
 Remove the chicken from the slow cooker and transfer it to individual serving dishes. The leftover sauce should be fairly thin, but you can still drizzle it over each serving of chicken to add more flavor if desired.

 Go through your current products to see if they have potential negative effects on organisms, soil, water or air quality. Replace your products with natural, non-harmful products.


Avoid overuse of organic pesticides and fertilizers. They can be harmful to microorganisms that are found in nutrient rich soil.;
, If you have used plastic bags to keep weeds at bay, then look for a local source of hay or straw. The more natural and nearby the product is, the better it will be for the environment.


April is a good time to remove mulch from your perennials. Clear it away as 1 of your Earth Day chores.
 If you are used to watering with a hose and sprinklers, then buy rain barrels to place beneath your drains. Also, find containers for gray water to take extra water from sinks or bathtubs to the garden.


Gray water is the excess water that comes from home taps and appliances. For example, placing a bucket below your shower drain or draining the dishwasher water into a bucket can reuse hundreds of gallons of water throughout the year.
 Mid to late April is a good time to start annuals and vegetables. Place them in small pots or seed containers so that they will be ready 6 to 10 weeks later.
 If these are crops that you want to grow later on, then they can be planted during the cooler sprint season. Wait to plant other crops until late spring or summer.
 Instead of choosing non-native flowers, go to your local library or gardening center to find out what flowers, grass and plants grow well with natural soil and water levels. They put less strain on the environment because they are hardy and do not require extra fertilizer and watering.
 Research the types of foods that can go in a composting bin. You can make a composting box from wooden slats if you don't want to buy a barrel.

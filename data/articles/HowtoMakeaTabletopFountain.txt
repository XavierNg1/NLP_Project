 They can be found in garden, hardware, and aquarium stores, and also on the Internet. Choose a water pump with suction cups on the bottom so it stays in place when in the fountain. The plastic tubing is used to direct where the water goes. The most common size is 5/8” outer diameter and 1/2” inner diameter.;
, Your container can be made out of ceramic, glass, plastic, or metal. Clay containers that are not already sealed need to be sealed or lined with plastic. To make a fountain in a basket, you can put a waterproof container inside the basket and hide it with rocks or plants.
 Keep the water level above the water pump. Then, turn on the pump to make sure it is working.
 Be creative with this step. You could also use a fountainhead, such as a lava rock, shell, or copper elbow. If the object does not already have a hole in it, you can drill a hole.
 For example, you could put in plants, candles, figurines, crystals, a mirror, or glass trinkets. Have fun with this step to make your fountain really personalized.
 To change the sound of the water, you can increase or decrease the water flow, or put rocks in the path of the water.
 Add fresh water when the water level is low. Every three months, take apart the fountain and clean the pump. If there is algae, put bleach in the water. If you like, you can rearrange the fountain when you put it back together, or try different decorations.

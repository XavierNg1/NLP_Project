You'll want to leave the skins on to keep the color. It will also be easier to remove the skin after you've steamed the beetroot., The water should be boiling. Place the lid over the steamer basket. No steam should escape.
 If you have large beetroot, consider cutting the quarters even smaller so they cook evenly and faster. Try 1/2 inch slices., Remove the lid and poke the beetroot with a fork or knife. The beetroot should be tender enough that the utensil easily slides in and out. If it is hard to poke or gets stuck, the beetroot needs to steam longer.
 Once the beetroot is tender, remove them from the steamer. Let the beetroot cool. Then, rub off the skin using a paper towel.
 Use your steamed beetroot as called for in another recipe, or simply dress the steamed beetroot with olive oil, vinegar, or fresh herbs.Steamed beetroot can make a great appetizer when paired with a sharp cheese or grain.

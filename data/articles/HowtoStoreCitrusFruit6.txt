Rinse the lemons and dry them before you begin. Using a shape knife, make a lengthwise cut in the lemon.

Make four incisions like this.Fill the sliced openings with Kosher, pickling or sea salt at about one tablespoon per lemon. Put the lemon into a clean quart-sized Mason jar. Continue to add salted lemons until the the jar is almost full, mashing them down so they fit.At this point you may add some spices and/or herbs such as cinnamon, cloves or bay leaves.
Seal the jars tightly and wait at least 3 weeks before eating they can be kept up to 6 months

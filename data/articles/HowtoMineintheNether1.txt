 For this you need Obsidian, which you can mine with a diamond pickaxe. If you don't know how to create a Nether Portal, follow this guide.
 Remember that you'll probably spend a long time in the Nether, so create a high ranked one (1 diamond pickaxe should be fine, or even 2-3 iron pickaxes). If you don't know how to create a pickaxe, read this.
 If you find yourself trapped in a small area, dig downwards. You should enter a world full of lava, Netherrack and mobs; this is where you want to start mining.

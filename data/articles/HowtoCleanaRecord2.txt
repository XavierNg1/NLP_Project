 If the record isn't that dirty, a brush meant specifically to clean records might be your best bet for cleaning. These brushes are designed to get in the grooves, while be soft enough not to scratch your record. Simply run the brush over the record, following the direction of the grooves.You can find a record brush online or a specialty music store. Look for a small hand-sized scrubber brush.
 Warm water can help dissolve the dirt on your records. However, make sure it is just lukewarm, not hot, as that can hurt your records. You should be able to stick your hand in it easily. How much you warm up depends on how many records you have to clean. Start with a cup.Distilled water is better because it doesn't have the minerals and other additions that your tap water has. It can remove much of the grime on your records.
 Start near the middle, following the direction of the grooves. Move outward in a spiraling circle. Don't get the label wet. Once you reach the outer edge, move back the other direction, going inward in a spiraling circle. Switch to the other side.Let the record dry completely.

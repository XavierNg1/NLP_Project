 When you find other families with young children, schedule playdates. Invite the other parent and child to your house. Once you get to know each other, you might find yourself scheduling a weekly playdate. You might even be able to trade off childcare.
 Visit local landmarks, parks, factories, and other places to enrich your childrenâ€™s education. This can be especially helpful in breaking up the day when you have small children at home.
 Give your kids a chance to get messy and creative. Plan arts and crafts projects that align with their interests. For example, if your child loves playing with play dough, try making handmade ornaments out of salt dough. If your child loves drawing, practice making a story book.


Build up a cache of materials to use in arts and crafts projects. This might include toilet paper tubes and paper towel tubes, egg cartons, ribbons, string, cellophane, pipe cleaners, and so on.
 Build library visits into your weekly schedule. This is a good opportunity to nurture a love for reading.


Most libraries hold story times that are age-specific. These can be wonderful opportunities to meet other families.
 If there are too many toys available, young kids may get overwhelmed with the choices. It can be hard to focus on one activity when there are 10 other possible activities in immediate view. Select some toys to remove from use and store them out of sight. Every few weeks, bring these toys back into circulation, removing and storing other toys.

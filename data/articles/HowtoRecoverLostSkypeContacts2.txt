 This might seem self-explanatory, but double-check that you’re actually on the right account first.
 Depending on how many Skype contacts you have, you might be able to search for their names and find them all.


Once logged in, at the top left of the window under your name, you’ll find a search bar.
Search for their username or their full name if you have that information. Then start adding your contacts back this way.
 If all else fails, you can contact Skype support and ask them to give you a contact list file. They save this information for up to 90 days for you.


Go to Skype support: support.skype.com/support_selection
Log in using your credentials. Once logged in, choose the topic: “Account and Password” and then choose the related problem: “Contact List.”
Follow the wizard and wait to speak to a Skype tech support agent. When you’ve a tech support on the line, explain the problem to them and they should be able to give you a contact list file.
 You can take the file that you’ve received from Skype support and add it to your account. This is called a “backup” of your contact list. It is highly recommended that you create a backup list often through Skype. Especially anytime you add several new contacts.


Open Skype and go to “Contacts.” Go to “Advanced” and then to “Restore Contacts from File.”
From the file explorer that appears, select the file the tech support gave you, and you’re done.

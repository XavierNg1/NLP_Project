 The ring is typically worn on the third finger of the left hand. This is the most common way to wear an engagement ring in many countries, especially in Western cultures. This dates back to the highly romantic idea that this finger has a vein that leads directly to the heart. That isn’t true, but it’s a nice thought for when you’re looking down at that pretty ring of yours., Wearing your ring on the third finger of your right hand is absolutely acceptable as well. The right hand is actually the traditional hand in countries like Russia, Greece, and Columbia. Wearing your ring on your right hand doesn’t have to signify your culture, though. It can simply be a personal preference., Once you’ve decided on the hand you’ll wear your ring on, consider how you will wear it after the wedding ceremony. You may decide not to have a wedding band, and that’s okay! If you have a wedding band, you will typically wear your engagement ring on top of it., There are traditions, but in the end, the choice is yours. Wear it on whatever finger feels the most comfortable. This could be your index or middle finger. If the size of the ring is the reason why you need to wear it on a certain finger, you may want to consider resizing it.
 Sometimes wearing the engagement ring on your finger isn’t the best option for you. This could be because of your career, a physical reason, pregnancy, or simply because you don’t like to wear anything on your fingers. Choose a chain that you like and slip the ring onto the chain. Wear it around your neck as you would any other necklace. It will be even closer to your heart.You can also look into companies like Ring My Neck, which makes necklaces specifically for engagement rings.

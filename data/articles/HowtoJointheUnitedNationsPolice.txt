 According to the United Nations, police and other law enforcement agents can be selected to join UNPOL. Therefore, police officers, investigators or border control officers, for example, are potential candidates to work in United Nations, especially in Peacekeeping Missions.;
,, The AMS is an exam that will test candidates in language proficiency (in English and/or French), the candidate’s ability to drive a 4WD car and the candidate’s shooting abilities. Some countries have a "pre SAAT" test before the official one, conducted by U.N., while others don't.
 This form will be sent to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. They will match your profile with one of the available field missions and put you in their roster. At the same time, you should provide medical examinations proving that you are physically fit for a peacekeeping mission.
 As one of the last steps, veteran police officers from the mission area will assess your knowledge about the peacekeeping mission you will be deployed to. Questions like the United Nations Core Values will be asked, as well as mission specific topics: geography, current economic and political situation and, mainly, how your police experience would help them in achieving the specific U.N. mandate for that mission.
 One of the United Nations Offices (usually UNDP) in your country will issue the air tickets so you can travel to mission area or to one of the Regional Service Centers in order to give you a "Induction Training". Usually this is done through your Government so the candidate has little (to say none) participation in this step.
 UNPOL members can be away from home from months to years. Prepare all the necessary paperwork so your family can be your representative while away.
 One veteran UNPOL will be waiting for you. Border control will be facilitated as you U.N. have agreements with host countries. In your first week, you will be issued your UN ID card and be part of a training program. Welcome to UNPOL family!

 Your mom may say that you are too young for makeup or that you do not need to wear makeup. Agree with her, and then tell her that you only want to wear a little bit of makeup. Tell her that you do not want to wear a full face of makeup just a little lip gloss, mascara, or eye shadow.You may say, “You’re right Mom. I’m too young to wear a ton of makeup every day. How about a little lip gloss instead?”
You may also say, “I know that makeup does not make me beautiful. I only want to wear a little bit to enhance my features. Maybe I can just wear some mascara.”

, Your mom may object because she does not want to pay for your makeup. Tell her that you will use your allowance or do some extra chores to cover the cost. This shows your mom that you understand the value of money and hard work. She will also know how serious you are about wearing makeup. You may say, “I know you work hard to provide for our family. I’d be happy to use my allowance to pay for my makeup.”

, Ask your mom if you can wear makeup for special occasions only. This is a nice compromise because you will not be wearing makeup every single day. Ask her to help you come up with a look that she thinks is appropriate.You can say, “I understand that you don’t want me to wear makeup to school every day. How about I only wear makeup for special occasions?”
You could also say, “Could you show me how to apply some eye shadow or blush just for special occasions?”

, Your Mom may not be open to any of your suggestions. If she gives you a firm no, do not pout or get an attitude with her. This will only hurt your chances in the future. Accept her decision and show her that you are a mature young person.You can ask her again in a few months.

 Netting is the preferred way to keep birds away from seedlings and is very easy to implement. Use bamboo poles, tall stakes or fence posts to create a framework around your plants. Drape your netting over the stakes and anchor it to the ground using bent wire.Try to drape your netting so it forms a V-shaped tent. This will prevent birds from accessing and pulling on the plants.;
, Cut the bottom off a clean, clear soda bottle. Position the bottle so it rests over the seedling, then remove the soda cap. This method allows sunlight to reach your seedling, while still keeping the plant out of reach of roaming birds.This method can also be done using upside-down berry baskets.
As your seedlings grow, you may have to prop up your bottles or baskets using bricks or rocks.
 Birds are easily confused by wire, so fishing line is a cheap and easy way to keep them away from your seedlings. Plant stakes, fence posts or bamboo poles around your garden and weave fishing line between the posts, above the plants.If you donâ€™t have fishing line, thread or wire will also work.

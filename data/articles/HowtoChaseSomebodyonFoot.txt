 Is the person armed, or is it somebody you would not be able to handle? If so, you had better not chase them.;
, If you know, you can go there instead of chasing them.
 Are you chasing the person for a good reason? If they have simply stolen a few dollars, or are a friend, you should chase them carefully, being careful not to knock things over, or not chase them at all.
 For example, if they go down some stairs, maybe you can jump over a railing to get down quicker?

, If you know they are about to kill somebody, or have stolen something very valuable, you may be forgiven for smashing a window, trespassing or knocking something over.
 If you do, you must look for signs of where they have gone, such as startled people and things that have been knocked over. If you cannot see anything like that, ask people very quickly.
 If you know the area well, try to make the person you are chasing run to a dead-end.
 Dive and grab the legs of the person you are chasing. Restrain the person and call for help.

 Roman numerals use fewer symbols than the number system you are used to. I is the number 1 (one), V is 5 (five), and X is 10 (ten), for example. Counting starts out as easy as I (one), II (two), III (three). But for the next one, write IV for "one away from five" (I away from V), which is four. This pattern continues with V (five), VI (five + one = six), VII (seven), VIII (eight), then IX ("one away from ten" = nine), X (ten). This may sound confusing, but you'll get the hang of it, Take a look at Roman numerals from 1 to 20:
I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV XVI XVII XVIII XIX XX;
, As you may know, the Roman numbering system is based on letters rather than a whole new alphabet for numbers.


I 1
V 5
X 10
L 50
C 100
D 500
M 1000

, The concept in step 1 is actually quite basic. That pattern repeats continuously throughout the system, no matter how great a number may be. For example:


From 40 to 50:
XL XLI XLII XLIII XLIV XLV XLVI XLVIII XLIX L
From 100 to 110:
C CI CII CIII CIV CV CVI CVII CVIII CIX CX
By hundreds, from 100 to 1000:
C CC CCC CD D DC DCC DCCC CM M

, There is no character representing 5000, so there are 3 ways to do this.


The Romans themselves just wrote MMMM for 4000.
To be faster, write the Roman numeral value for 4 in parentheses like so: (IV)
Finally, a bar could be drawn above the number rather than putting the number in parentheses.
 After understanding how the individual numbers are written, it is easy to understand how MCMXXXIV (used as an example in the introduction) means 1934. To get MCMXXXIV, simply add: MCM (1900) + XXX (30) + IV (4). To get MDCCLXXVI (1776), simply add: MDCC (1700) + LXX (70) + VI (6).

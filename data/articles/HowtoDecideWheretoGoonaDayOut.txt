 At the start of the holidays the kids won't really mind where they go. Maybe you can call up a few of the moms or dads that you know from school and invite everyone to a local park or inexpensive country park with play areas.;
, Maybe there are some forest trails in the areas. Take along a bike, scooter, skateboard, whatever pleases the kids really, or enjoy a nice walk along the trails, maybe listen to the forest awaken between 6am and 8am, or if the kids want a nice lie in then any time will do, after all, it's the cheap day out that counts!

, There is a perfect theory to this: Hit the beach with buckets, spades, nets and swimsuits for them and a book and towel for you, you can even bring a sun lounger and try to tan!

, The kids will be occupied with their friends, it's the perfect cocktail!

, There's plenty of good ones in Britain, like Alton Towers, Thorpe Park, Pleasure Beach, Oakwood, Drayton Manor, Chessington World of Adventures and West Midlands Safari Park. Check the locations and find your closest one.

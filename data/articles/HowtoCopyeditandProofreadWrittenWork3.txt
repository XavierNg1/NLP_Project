 When you are copyediting, you are checking the text to be sure that it is clear, correct, concise, comprehensible, and consistent.This is much more than proofreading text. Your edits should ensure that the reader understands the text as the author intended.


Clear/clarity- The reader should not be confused or misunderstand any of the text.
Correct- Spelling, grammar, and punctuation are correct.
Concise- The text is not filled with unnecessary words, phrases, or sentences that do not add to the content or quality of the text.
Comprehensible- The text is not filled with abbreviations and acronyms that may not be clear to the average reader.
Consistent- The same style and spelling is used throughout the text. For example, the text does not switch between "five" and "5" or "color" and "colour."

, Copyediting and proofreading take time. It typically takes a professional copyeditor an hour to edit six pages of double-spaced text.You will also need to take breaks and view the text with fresh eyes.


Copyediting is done before proofreading. If the text was thoroughly copyedited, proofreading should not take very long.
Keep the copyediting and proofreading processes separate. They have different purposes.If you are copyediting and proofreading your own work, finish the draft of your work early so you have plenty of time to edit. If you plan to edit someone else's work, ask them to get it to you well before their deadline so you can do a good job.

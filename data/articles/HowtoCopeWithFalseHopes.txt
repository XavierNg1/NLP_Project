 You won't always get everything you expect, so you have to be prepared for a letdown.;
, If someone has let you down before, he or she is more likely to let you down again.
 NATO = No Action Talk Only. Some people just talk as if things are simple, and that they will definitely help you, but when it comes to the real situation, they are the first ones to run away or make themselves unavailable.
 If you're a little wary of talking to the person, you can use text messages or e-mail. If they still can't get it, tell them not to make empty promises or say things like, "you are not man enough to keep promises, please don't give false hopes."

, If they don't appreciate it, once they experience, they will soon realize.
 This is common sense.
 Tell a friend/family member/boy-girlfriend how you feel, and they may, it not actually help, be there to listen and comfort you. It helps to share your emotions,so at least its out of your system.
 A good way to soften the blow is turn your focus on something else while you're waiting so that it doesn't seem as important and that big a deal. For example, when your boy/girlfriend promises to call you, and they don't ever normally do that anyway, mentally put away your cell phone and do something else that you enjoy; play some sports, watch a movie, talk to a friend...leave the house! If you focus enough, you'll be amazed how little that broken promise hurts now that you're not thinking about it.
 If you've tried talking to them, you gave them the benefit of doubt, and its just you they seem to have that problem with (so that forgetfulness and work is not an excuse anymore, then its time to move on. You deserve better.

 Place a large skillet over medium heat. Melt the butter, then add the onions, carrots, and celery. Cook the vegetables until the onions are translucent and the carrots and celery brighten, about 10 minutes., Sprinkle the flour evenly over the vegetables. Stir it in with a spoon as the vegetables keep sauteing, making sure that the flour coats them completely.
 Pour the milk and chicken stock into the pan. Stir the mixture and let it simmer until it begins to thicken, which should happen after about 10 minutes.


If the mixture boils, turn it down, so that the liquid doesn't cook off too quickly.
Add a little more milk or stock if the mixture looks too thick.
 Stir in the chicken, peas, thyme, sage, salt and pepper. Stir the filling and let it simmer for another 5 minutes. Taste it and add more salt and pepper if necessary. Remove the filling from heat, cover it, and set it aside.

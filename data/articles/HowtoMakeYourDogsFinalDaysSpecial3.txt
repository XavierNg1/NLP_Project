 It is important to find ways to manage your dog’s pain towards the end of his life. Make sure that you know what to look for to tell if your dog is in pain and discuss your dog’s pain control options with your dog’s veterinarian.You may also want to ask your vet about your dog’s limitations regarding exercise.
 Like hospice for humans, pet hospice is a service available to dogs that can help to promote comfort and quality of life as they spend their last days at home. Talk to your dog’s veterinarian about whether or not pet hospice is appropriate for your dog., Although this may be difficult for you to consider, sometimes opting to have your dog euthanized is the most humane option.If your dog is suffering and there is nothing your vet can do to improve his quality of life, then you may want to consider euthanasia.


Discuss euthanasia with your veterinarian to find out when this option may be appropriate for your pet.

 Open-angle glaucoma leads to the gradual deterioration of your vision over an extended period of time, usually years. Most people suffering from open-angle fail to notice symptoms until the glaucoma is very advanced and nerve damage has occurred.Because open-angle develops so slowly and stealthily, it is important to schedule eye examines every year, especially if you are over the age of 40 or have a family history or glaucoma.
Open-angle is the most common type of glaucoma in the United States, affecting roughly 4 million people.
Realize that nerve damage is permanent. If you suffer from open-angle glaucoma, there is unfortunately no cure and, once symptoms have presented, significant nerve damage has occurred. Although your doctor may be able to slow the deterioration, the damage done to your vision is largely irreversible.;
, As your nerves become increasingly more damaged, blind spots will develop in your field of vision. Blind spots are exactly what they sound like, areas in your vision where you are unable to see things. Eventually, the nerve damage becomes so severe that you lose your vision entirely.If you notice any blind spots, talk to your doctor immediately.
 With open-angle glaucoma, you will eventually notice a loss of peripheral or side vision. Objectives at the edges of your vision will become increasingly less clear and more difficult to define. As the glaucoma worsens, your vision will narrow and you will only be able to see things directly in front of you.The resulting loss of vision will come to resemble tunnel vision.

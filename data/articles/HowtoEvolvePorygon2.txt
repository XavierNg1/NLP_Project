, Open your Pokémon menu and give Porygon2 the Dubious Disc item. Since you can usually only get one Dubious Disc per game, make sure you equip it to the Porygon2 that you want to evolve the most.
 Find a friend or trade Porygon2 to yourself if you have two games. When the trade occurs, Porygon2 will evolve into Porygon-Z. You can then trade Porygon-Z back to your game to use it.

Devise a light-hearted way to send the message that you need personal space. When this happens, your extroverted friends and family can back off until you’re fully recharged.For instance, a friend calls several times and you don’t answer. Instead of making them feel ignored, you could send a quick text saying, “Sorry, I’m currently "introverting." Can I call you later?” If it’s not urgent, they can oblige your need for alone time.
 Introverts vary greatly, so not all use the same activities to recharge. However, many introverts endorse feeling greatly replenished by Mother Nature. You may go outdoors often to enjoy nature and reboot.If your extrovert wants to join you outdoors, let them know what you need from them. This can be as simple as saying, “Is it okay if we just watch the waves and not talk?” Or, make sure you both bring along reading material.
 The world puts a lot of pressure on introverts to be more outgoing. The most supportive thing an extroverted loved one can do is to appreciate that you aren’t that way by choice, but by nature. If your friends and family are considerate of your personality preferences, you’ll feel happier.

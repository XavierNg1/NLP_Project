 It proves most effective at the start of the growing season, when nut grass is just barely beginning to germinate and sprout.
 You do not need to soak it, but the lawn should be evenly moist down to the soil.
 Walk up and down the lawn in straight lines and at a steady pace. Pour the sugar through a sifter as you walk, continually turning the handle of the sifter the make sure that the sugar falls on the grass in even amounts.


This is no mere folk remedy. Sugar actually "eats" the nut grass while nourishing microbes that have a positive effect on your lawn.
 Do not saturate the grass, since doing so will wash the sugar away. Spray the lawn with a light mist, providing just enough water to re-moisten the blades of grass and coax the sugar down into the soil and the roots of the lawn.
 The nut grass may not die off completely after the first treatment, but after a couple more, all of it should be dead.

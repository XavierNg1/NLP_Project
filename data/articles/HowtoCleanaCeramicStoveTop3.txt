 A magic eraser is a special sort of sponge. Its microporous structure allows it to clean surfaces that prove impossible to clean via normal methods. If your ceramic stovetop has resisted baking soda and razor scraper cleaning solutions, try a magic eraser.You can obtain a magic eraser at your local big box grocery store, or online.
 There are a number of products available designed specifically to clean ceramic stovetops. Cerama Bryte and Cook Top are two such specialized ceramic cooktop cleaners. Each cleaning product is slightly different, so consult manufacturer instructions for more detailed information regarding use.Generally, you’ll spray or sprinkle your stovetop with the specially-formulated cleaning agent, then wipe the surface with a damp rag or sponge.
These products are useful for cutting through grease stains and burned-on material.
 If, after wiping the ceramic stovetop down with baking soda and a damp rag, it is still not clean, use a razor scraper to scrape the debris off. A razor scraper is a small tool consisting of a handle and a razor blade with its edge facing out. Run the blade along the burned material at a sharp angle by keeping the blade and its handle as close as possible to the surface of the ceramic stovetop.Wipe the stovetop with a damp, soapy sponge before scraping it with the razor scraper.
Do not move the blade in a direction that runs parallel to the blade or you’ll scratch the surface of the cooktop. Always move the blade in a direction that is perpendicular to it.
Cleaning the stovetop with a razor scraper should be a last resort.

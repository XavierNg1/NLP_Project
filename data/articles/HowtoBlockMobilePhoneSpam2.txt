2. Log in at http://mymessages.wireless.att.com. Under Preferences, look for the text-blocking and alias options. You can also block specific addresses and websites.

Verizon Wireless: Head on over to http://www.verizonwireless.com, and make sure you're logged in first, if not, log in. Under "My Verizon" you should see "My Services", and then under My Services, you should see a list of options, at the bottom of the list should be "Spam Control". Go ahead and click that, and from there you can block up to five numbers and 15 internet emails/domains/etc.

T-Mobile: Log into http://www.t-mobile.com and go to "My t-mobile" using the t-mobile sites drop down at the top of the page. Now, search for "Change plan or services" and click the link.

Here, you can block text messages, instant messages, photo messages, messages sent via e-mail, or even all text messages.

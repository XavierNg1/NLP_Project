 Just like people, lovebirds can get depressed or anxious when they don’t feel well. If your bird seems withdrawn, shows little interest in fly time, sleeps a lot, or gets overly nervous or excited when someone enters the room, it could be a sign that they feel sick., Both a decrease or a sudden increase in thirst or appetite could be signs that your bird is sick, and may be indicators of nutritional disorders, a common problem in lovebirds. Pay close attention to how much your lovebird eats and drinks on a daily basis. If you notice a sudden change, contact your vet for recommendation on treatment., If your bird has drooping wings, frequently tucks their head, or huddles, it could be a sign that they don’t feel well. Behavioral symptoms such as these are typically considered critical, and require a vet visit immediately., Sitting on the cage floor or holding onto the cage with their beak instead of sitting comfortably on a perch are two major indicators that something is wrong. If your bird is unable to perch normally, contact an avian vet immediately for recommendations and to see if an appointment may be necessary., When a bird doesn’t move around much in its cage, it can be an indicator of stress or a larger health problem. If you notice your bird staying on a single perch or sitting for long periods at their food or water dish, they may be exhibiting symptoms of a serious illness.

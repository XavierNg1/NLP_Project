 Quick-switching (q by default, can be enabled in console)makes a noise that, if you are close enough, will give you away. Have your knife out beforehand.;
, If you are in a knife fight, then ignore this step. It will do you no good. If you are not, then walk, rather than run. There is a walk button for a reason. Footsteps are silent when you walk, but you will slow down. If he is running, run carefully behind, once you are close, walk. This should set you up perfectly. Once you get closer, execute a backstab.
 It takes two stabs to finish someone off. Do it fast. The longer you wait, the more time you give them to get you. Once you get the hang of knifing someone with the two right click move, try the 3 hit combo. This consists of doing 2 left clicks and 1 right click. It does 100 damage in all, and is faster than the traditional 2 right click move. One right click to the back will be a one hit KO.
 The worst thing you can do is be a sitting duck. Move around, and watch them, when they get close, stab and back off. Don't just sit there.

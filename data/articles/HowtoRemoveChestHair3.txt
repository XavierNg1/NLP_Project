 Electrolysis is a procedure utilizing an incredibly slim needle, which essentially delivers small shocks of electricity to each individual hair follicle. This goes a step beyond waxing and not only removes hair at its root but kills the cells that grow the hair. Which is all to say: electrolysis is permanent.
 Because it attacks every single hair one by one, electrolysis can be extremely time-consuming. Weekly sessions could easily stretch into a year, total, for the particularly hirsute.


Luckily, the actual sessions are fairly brief, only lasting from 10-30 minutes. , With electrolysis, youâ€™ll need to talk with your physician for a recommendation, so it definitely requires more planning than shaving or waxing. Your doctor will be able to point you in the right direction, as well as inform you of any unique reason that electrolysis might not be suitable for you.


Those who use pacemakers, for example, cannot undergo electrolysis for risk of it interfering with the device.

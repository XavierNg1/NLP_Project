 You will need sugar, lime juice, mint sprigs, sparkling water, rum and ice.;
, Set out teaspoons for sugar, lime juice squeezers for limes (if youâ€™re not going to squeeze the limes beforehand), muddlers for the mint, 1-ounce (30 milliliters) shot glasses for measuring the sparkling water and rum and a scoop or tongs for the ice.
 You can provide old-fashioned glasses or any other type of cylindrical glass.
 You can provide a dish of strawberries that people can muddle with their mint leaves to make strawberry mojitos. You can also place mango puree or watermelon puree on your table to allow your guests to create other variations on the traditional mojito.
,, For instance, let guests know how many strawberries to muddle if they want to make strawberry mojitos.
 Throughout the party, you will need to ensure that your guests have the ingredients that they need to continue making mojitos. Be sure that you purchase enough ingredients before the party. Estimate about 1 mojito per person for each hour of your party and multiply the ingredients accordingly.

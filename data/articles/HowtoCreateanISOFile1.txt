 There are a variety of programs that can be downloaded for free or purchased that will allow you to create ISO files from a CD, DVD, or Bluray Disc (BD). Popular programs include MagicISO, ISO Recorder, and ImgBurn.


Only download programs directly from the developer. If you download the program from another location, you risk malware or adware infection.;
, You can usually leave most of the default options as they are. Some programs, such as ImgBurn, come bundled with lots of ad software that need to be disabled during installation, so make sure that you carefully read each screen before continuing.
 Copying a disc to ISO format is called "ripping", and allows you to create perfect backups of any disc in single files. Make sure your drive supports the disc you want to rip. For example, you cannot rip a Blu-ray disc in a DVD drive, but you can rip a DVD disc in a Blu Ray drive.
 Find the "Create Image from Disc" button. The wording may change depending on the program you are using. For example, it may say "Copy to Image". There is often an image of a disc in the button icon to signify that the ISO is coming from the disc's data.


You may be asked to designate the source. Make sure the proper disc drive is selected.
 You will need to save the file somewhere on your computer while it is being created. Keep in mind that the ISO file will be the exact same size as the original disc, so make sure that your hard disk has enough space to store it. This is especially important with BDs, as they can reach sizes up to 50 GB.


Make sure to give it a name that you can remember or recognize easily.
 Once you've set where the file is to be saved, the ripping process will begin. This can take a significant amount of time, especially with BDs. Once the process is complete, the ISO file will be in the location you specified earlier, and can now be burned or mounted.

 The bulbs can be planted outdoors in the garden as soon as the soil thaws, if the leaves have died.


If the bulbs were forced late enough in the season that they still have green leaves in the spring, plant them outdoors right away after the last expected hard frost.
Plant the bulbs at a depth equal to three to four times the bulbâ€™s width.
 When gardeners go to replant the seasonal bulbs, they should select a sunny, well-drained spot. They may also want to add some fertilizer to the soil to encourage the plants to bloom and then do the same in the fall of the year for the same reasons.
 Gardeners should be aware that forced bulb plants may not flower the year after they are replanted. These bulbs could need some time to recover from this process because, when gardeners force the blooms, doing so uses up a great deal of energy. Plants tend to need about two years to recover completely from being forced.


Again, amaryllises are the exception. If given adequate care, these plants will get larger with each passing year. Older specimens are known to produce many large flowers on an annual basis.

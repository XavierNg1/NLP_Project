 Head to the shower as soon as you get out of the water. Showering right away will help to remove any chlorine or salt on your skin before it has a chance to dry it out.If you tend to get in and out of the water while you swim, try to shower between swims. This will help to reduce the amount of time the pool or ocean water stays on your skin.
 Apply a mild shower gel to your skin when you shower. Be sure to wash your entire body, including your feet and toes. Use a clean washcloth to gently rub your body with the shower gel to remove the pool or ocean water.You should also wash your hair during the shower, as the chemicals in pool water can damage your hair if they stay on your scalp for too long.
Salt water can also be harsh on your hair so you should shower using mild shower gel after you swim in the ocean.
 Put a moisturizing cream or lotion on your skin right after the shower. This will help to lock in the moisture and ensure your skin does not become too dry. Put the lotion on your entire body, including between your toes and behind your ears.

 In a food processor, combine flours, sugar, milk powder, baking powder, and salt. Mix for 15 seconds.If you want to make a chocolate cake, add 1 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder into the food processor.
 After processing the dry ingredients, add the butter and vanilla. Lightly toss the butter with a fork until they are coated with the ingredients. Pulse everything together until they look like very fine crumbs., If you don't want to use it right away, store the mixture. Place it in an airtight freezer bag or an airtight container and then store it in the freezer. This mixture needs to be frozen because it includes the wet ingredients (butter and vanilla extract), which will go bad if not frozen.


You can store this mixture in the freezer for up to 2 months.When you get ready to use the recipe, mix the mixture with 1 1/4 cups of warm water and 2 room temperature eggs for about two minutes. Then place in a pan.

, Create an upside down checkmark and two round shapes. Place the larger round shape on top of her head and the smaller one the right side of her face.
 Draw eyes by sketching circles, and then draw small elongated triangles for eyelashes and eyebrows. Finish the face by showing off her teeth and sketching a big grin.
 This includes a crown, an earring, and spiral lines on the hair and ears.
 You can do this by drawing a vertical curve line to serve as your guideline. Draw her body as you did with her head. Make the left side of her body round. The right side should be mostly angular. Add a small wing at her back.
 Note: the wand has a star on its tip.

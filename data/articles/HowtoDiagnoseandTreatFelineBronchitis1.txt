 At first, it might be difficult to distinguish a persistent cough from normal hairballs. Notice if your cat coughs repeatedly over the course of days or weeks. As you make your observations, look for potential environmental causes, such as:Pollen conditions
Whether anyone is smoking nearby
Any perfume, cologne, or air freshener you’ve used
Dusty cat litter
Dust inside and outside of the house
Contact with other cats with viruses;
, If you notice your cat has a persistent cough, look for signs of difficult breathing. Hold your ear near its chest and mouth and listen for wheezing or crackling sounds. Take note if its breathing seems visibly labored or if it consistently breathes through its mouth., If you have a pet thermometer, take your cat’s temperature. A temperature of 103.5 degrees Fahrenheit (39.7 degrees Celsius) or higher indicates a fever. Other symptoms of bronchitis include general stress and loss of appetite.You might also notice a bluish tint to the mucous membranes, like the nose, gums, and lips. This is due to a lack of oxygen in the bloodstream caused by respiratory difficulty.
If you notice these symptoms, take your cat to the vet immediately. If the symptoms worsen, your cat could experience respiratory failure.

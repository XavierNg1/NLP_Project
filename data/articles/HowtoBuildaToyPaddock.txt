, If necessary saw it to the height you would like the fence to be, I suggest just below the head. Measure these so that they fit each side of the wood, two longer for the longer sides and two for the shorter ones. Also, make sure these are not too thick so they do not invade the space. If desired, a 4 inch (10cm) piece of wood can be cut out of the smaller side to make a gateway. Leave the 10 cm piece of wood to one side.
 With your 10cm piece of wood, use hinges and screw them onto the smaller side BEFORE gluing down. Once this has been done, screw it onto the gate, making sure they are secure. If hinges are not available, use a toy fence or makeshift one instead, perhaps out of pipe cleaners or lollipop sticks.
 These will make the fencing around the paddock. Wait to dry using the manufacturers instructions, and make sure they are secure;if not restart the step until they are. If it is warm out side and is not due to rain, leave outside in a secure area where no animals can get to, to dry for the night. Or in a warm airing cupboard!

, If this is not available, try using a green piece of paper or wool cut up instead. Stick the grass down to the hard board and wait for the glue to dry. (This is optional, you do not have to glue it to the board for different scenes, Replace the grass with sand for a dressage ring or wood shavings. You could even use stones and pebbles!)

, Make small jumps out of wood or cardboard for a more realistic effect. Maybe use a small doll or rider to ride your horse. From most good toy shops, tree's and shelters may be available, for that extra touch. You can also find rocks and pebbles in the garden, They make great walls, jumps and scenery!

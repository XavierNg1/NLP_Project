 All players sit in a circle. The game leader announces that pictures are to be drawn in the following manner:


First - Draw a head (either animal or human), fold the paper, pass it to the right.
Second - Draw a neck, shoulders, and arms. Pass it to the right.
Third - Complete the body (the former player having left two lines below the fold of the paper). Pass it to the right.
Fourth - A skirt, trousers or legs, as the case may be. Pass it to the right.
Fifth - The feet, and if you wish to add to the fun, the last one writes a name either of some one present or some noted person.;

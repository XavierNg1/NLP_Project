 Use your lubricated spray or Windex. As you work with the new tire, keep spraying it to keep it slippery and easier to work with.
 There is also a red dot on the tire that should be located next to the valve stem. Make sure you note this dot and the spin of the tire and set it up

, This time, the tire wall will be placed between the tire iron and the rim so the tire iron can push the tire into the rim. The bead of the tire acts as the fulcrum, with you pushing away from the center of the tire to ease the bead under the rim.


Repeat on the other side once the first is in.
 You just want to pump until you hear a small "pop." This indicates the bead has popped in.


You can also take a small hammer and hit the tire around the bead as you fill it up. This will shift the tires slightly as it fills, making it more likely that it slips into the bead.
 You can use this tool to press the bead in and then rotate the tire to get the bead in from all edges.


Do not keep pumping up if you can't get the bead in. Let some air back out, then re-pump and use the tool.
When the tire is not fully inflated, you can usually rotate it a bit still. Make sure that red dot is balanced with the valve stem.
 Squirt a bit of ceramic dust (made for tires) into the tire valve. It keeps the tire balanced and equalizes some of the weight, balancing out any issues. Do this before putting the valve stem back on.
 Tighten it back on and make sure it doesn't move.
 Pump the tire up to normal and you're good to ride!

 The best place would be a wide, sunny windowsill, or a sunny area in a bright room.;
, For added fun, decorate your pots. Fill it with compost.
 For better looks, choose smooth rocks, or rocks with interesting patterns on them. You can paint them for a more colourful garden.
 Choose hardier plants for a cooler windowsill. If you spend a lot of time away from home, choose plants that need very little watering. If you like natural colour, choose plants that flower a lot.


If you have a window box, plant them. Make a hole in the compost the same size as the pot of the plant that you're transplanting. Water the plant and let it sit for a couple of minutes. Put your hand over the soil in the pot, turn the pot upside down and gently squeeze the pot until the whole set slides out. Set the roots and soil into the hole in the window box, firm the compost down around it and add more if necessary.

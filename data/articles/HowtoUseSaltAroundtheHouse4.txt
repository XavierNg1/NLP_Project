, This is a great non-toxic solution for killing weeds. You can also sprinkle dry salt into any crack or crevice where you don’t want grass to grow; the salt will kill the grass.
 Vacuum the carpet the following day and your carpets will be fresher and the salt odor will help to repel fleas. Rinsing your pet’s bedding in salt water will also help control fleas.
 The salt draws moisture from the slugs, which kills them.

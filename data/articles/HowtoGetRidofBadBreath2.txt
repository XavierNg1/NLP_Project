That's why your breath is worse in the morning; your mouth produces less saliva as you sleep. Saliva is the enemy of bad breath because not only does it physically wash bacteria and food particles away, but it also has antiseptic and enzymes that kill bacteria.Chewing gum stimulates saliva production (in addition to covering up the odor with some kind of scent).

Water won't necessarily increase saliva production, but it'll wash out your mouth â€” and it is good for you. See How to Drink More Water Every Day.

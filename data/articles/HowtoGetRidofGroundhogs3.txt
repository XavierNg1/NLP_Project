 This can often be an inhumane solution, as these traps do not always kill animals instantly. It can also be difficult to know which burrow entrance to place the trap outside, and the traps pose a significant danger to small children and pets. The specifics of setting lethal traps vary depending on the type you buy, and you should pay close attention to the instructions., This poses the same threats as traps and fumigation: the poison poses a danger to pets and people, and the bodies will be very hard to deal with if they die underground. If you decide to go this route, however, the process is very straightforward: place the poison in the areas of your garden that the groundhogs most like to frequent., This is generally only an option if you live in a removed area, and are an excellent marksman. A groundhog that has been shot but not killed can become much more dangerous and aggressive than it otherwise would be, and can present a real danger to children and pets if it gets away. As such, this is generally not a recommended way to deal with groundhogs.

 You can purchase magnets from your local hardware or school supplies store.
 Place the magnet at the back of your phone for a couple of seconds then wait for your Android phone to go into multimedia mode.


What the magnet does is it tricks the phone to recognizing it to be connected to a docking station (like a car dock) and initiates the phone to switch into multimedia mode, giving you access to the screen.
 Press the Back soft key button (located below the screen) to exit the multimedia mode and access its home screen.
 Do this once your phone switches to multimedia mode.

 One of the easiest ways to download YouTube videos is with the DownloadHelper extension for Firefox. This program will automatically provide you with a variety of quality and format options for every YouTube video that you load.
 Once the video has been loaded, you will see the DownloadHelper icon animate in the top-right corner of the page. Click it to open the download options., You can choose what file format you would like to save the video in,a s well as the quality of the video. MP4 is the most universal format, and can be played in most mobile devices.


Higher quality videos will result in larger files.
 Once you have selected the format and quality, the video will be downloaded to your Firefox download folder. You can access the video like you would any other video file.
 If you donâ€™t have Firefox or would rather not install any plugins, you can use YouTube download sites such as KeepVid to save the file. These sites will give you the same download options as DownloadHelper, and the file will be downloaded to your default Downloads folder. (You will need JAVA installed in your system to use these online download service).

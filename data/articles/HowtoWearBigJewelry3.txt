 This is because big bracelets and necklaces usually overlap clothing, creating a sense of composition even if they don't match exactly. Earrings, on the other hand, are located further away from your clothes, so you'll want to have at least one corresponding color between the two of them.


This is the rule of thumb unless you're wearing a neutral color, in which case your earrings can be your statement piece. Want to spice up an old beige sweater or a gray pair of pants? Just put on some shoulder-length earrings and you've got a conversation starter right there.
 Emerald chandelier earrings, enormous sapphires--keep them out of your day-to-day life unless you're a princess or a daring debutante.
 Feather earrings can be difficult to manage and clean. Try to only wear them on sunny, windless days, so they don't get wet or fly up like an umbrella during an aggressive storm.
 This will prevent any overlap, and big earrings just look better when they have more room.
 If you're really worried, you should probably put up your hair and wear a tank top or other shirt that's unlikely to get snagged on an earring.
 If you start to feel pain or even discomfort, take out the earrings and check for redness. You also might want to clean the hook/pole with isopropyl rubbing alcohol from time to time (although this goes for all of your earrings, especially if they're hurting your ears). If cleaning them doesn't relieve your discomfort, you may be allergic to them--some people can only wear earrings with solid gold hooks/poles.

 You'll need to know how much fabric will look right. Measure from the top of the shoulder, up over the head to top of the other shoulder. This will give you your length.









Mark a piece of fabric with the appropriate length. Then, measure from the top of head to the back for the length of hood; make it longer if you want it to come partially down over the face.
 You may find it easier if you fold it in half so the short sides are together. Those short sides will attach to the cloak itself; one of the long sides must be sewn together to create the back of the hood.









Once you have sewn one of the long sides together, sew the short sides to the edge of the cloak. The long side will form a seam from the cloak to the top of the head; the short sides will form a seam along your neck.
 That is, if you do not have a closure on the cloak itself. You can use a pin, sew strings on it to tie, sew frogs on it, or use anything else you would think appropriate.









For kids, frogs since are the easiest to work with and safer than pins. These do not look like frogs -- they sort of look like fleur de lis, are fabric, and wrap together to stay closed.

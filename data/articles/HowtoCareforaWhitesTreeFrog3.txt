 In the wild, White’s tree frogs feed on moths, locusts, crickets, and roaches. You should feed these insects to your adult frog 2-3 times a week and to younger frogs 1-2 times a week. Feed your frog, adult or tadpole, 4-5 insects per feeding.Frogs reach adulthood when they are no longer in the tadpole stage. Your frog will be adult when it has developed legs and its tail has re-absorbed into its body.You can feed your adult White’s tree frog the occasional pinkie mouse as a treat. Mice are high in fat, so refrain from giving pinkie mice to your adult frog too often to avoid health complications.Dust the live food with reptile calcium powder and reptile multivitamin supplements once a week., The pool should be shallow enough that the water does go over your frog’s head. Use bottled spring water or charcoal-filtered tap water., Rinse them thoroughly. Residue or oil on your hands can harm your frog, and your frog secretes toxins that could be harmful to you, so washing your hands is important.You can even wear latex gloves as a protective barrier if you must handle your frog.

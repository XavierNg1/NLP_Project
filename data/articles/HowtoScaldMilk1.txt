 A glass bowl is generally preferred, but a plastic bowl will also work as long as it is labeled safe for use in a microwave. It is important that you pre-measure the milk before scalding it, since you should not pour extra scalded milk back into the jug of un-scalded milk it originally came from.

, You could also use a bamboo skewer or any other tool with a long handle that is made from microwavable material. This step is needed in order to prevent the milk from super-heating beyond the temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius). Super-heated milk can scorch and has the potential to cause serious burns if it spills onto your skin. The tool must break the surface of the milk, however, since it will not be of much use otherwise.
 If your microwave has a rotating plate, make sure that you change the microwave's settings so that the plate does rotate properly. The milk is finished scalding once it begins to boil.









If your microwave does not have a rotating plate, stop the microwave halfway in between the cooking time and turn the container of milk 180 degrees. Otherwise, it may heat unevenly.
 The container will be very hot, so pot holders are essential. Move the container of milk carefully to prevent hot milk from spilling out onto your skin. Place the container on a hotplate, wire rack, or other heat-resistant surface and use it shortly thereafter.

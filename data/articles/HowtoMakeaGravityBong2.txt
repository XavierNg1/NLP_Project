 You want one that is at least a 2 liter bottle, though 3 liters are even better.

Empty its contents. Take note of the contour of the bottle before you start cutting. There's usually a ring near the bottom that's just above the 5 fingered base. It's an excellent guide line.
 With a 3/8 drill bit, drill a hole in the center of the plastic lid. If you don't have access to a drill, you can just take a lighter and slowly melt the top of the cap slightly so it softens up, then push a metal pipe into the melting plastic for an airtight seal.
 Use a socket from a socket wrench set, a bowl from another water pipe, or a funnel bowl as described in the Waterfall method.
 You will want one large enough to fully submerge your container. Full gallon jugs work well for this, too.









Fill it with water. Place the container into the water with the cap removed. The top of the container should rest an inch or two above the surface of the water.
Load the bucket with your desired smoking substance and screw on your lid. Be sure to put the container into the water first, before screwing on your lid, or it'll blow your herb right out of the bowl.
 As you are lighting, slowly draw the bottle out of the water. The chamber will fill with smoke.









Once the container is nearly full and before the bottom comes out of the water, prepare yourself: breathe out!

, Twist off the cap and place your mouth on top of the container and, without inhaling, push the bottle down til it reaches the bottom of the bucket. This will force the smoke into your mouth without you even inhaling. When the bottle reaches the bottom, inhale the rest and take your mouth off just before the water rises all the way to the top close to your mouth.









If you inhale while pushing the bottle down, you might not be able to clear the whole thing.

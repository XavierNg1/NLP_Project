 First, carefully lift the top "bonnet" of the typewriter. Then, look for the typewriter ribbon wound around two metal or plastic spools: much like the sort that you'd use for sewing thread or rope. The spools are set up in an S- shaped configuration on two axles. The ribbon itself stretches between the spools and through an aligning scale.


Remove your typewriter's cover by pressing it on both sides, next to the separating line. Press gently but firmly until the cover clicks open.The spools may be covered up in newer typewriter models. Look for a small clasp or button to remove this cover.;
, Before you take your typewriter apart, make sure that you know how to put it back together. Consider taking a photo of the insides to remind yourself later on. If you have access to a physical or online PDF copy of the typewriter manual, then this document should include basic instructions on how to change the ribbon., The process depends on what type pf typewriter you have. If you have a manual typewriter, then lift the spools directly out of the machine. On a cartridge typewriter, simply press the release lever to disengage the ribbon.To disengage the spools: simply pull them straight up out of the typewriter.
There may also be two additional spring-loaded metal pieces that hold the ribbon in place. They'll be located close to the ribbon spools. Apply pressure to finger-holds on these pieces, and you should be able to loosen the ribbon tension enough for you to pull it out., First, open the ribbon gate: the small piece of metal that holds the ribbon against the paper, where the keys will hit it. Then, pull the entire ribbon out of the machine. Be gentle so that you don't damage any of the components! Put the old ink cartridge to the side. Now, you are ready to install the new ribbon.

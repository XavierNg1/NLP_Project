 The initial step in this process is a clear and unequivocal approach in searching for a girl, whether itâ€™s by family search, internet basis, or friends/ relative suggestion. Everyone has different dreams and these should be the main focus, and then make other priorities.;
, Once you are ready to meet a girl, make sure you discuss the key points which your family wants considered. Also, your family should be involved in the conversation at some level, as the girl should be clear-minded about what you are both expecting and how much she can direct.
 There is no need to dress in your best dress or try to dress in the latest fashion. Dress up one level from what you are already doing in your daily routine, so that more of your natural side is shown, and please don't try to be a swank.
 When on the first meeting, try to talk about your main goals, focus and expectations. Also try to watch for the girl's reaction, respect her preferences and likes, and have high regard for her achievements. This will make her feel comfortable, gratified and fulfilled by the meeting.
 This is very important, as one should not exceed more than 5 meetings. More meetings will make things confusing; it is better to see the simpler side of her, which will make it easier for you.
 This will help you to know more about the girl

, If she seems uninterested or she is not interested, leave immediately. You don't want a girl who doesn't listen when you talk even if she is a rich beautiful girl.You marry to have a healthy family relation not a rich unsatisfied one

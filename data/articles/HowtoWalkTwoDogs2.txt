 The heel position is when the dog's shoulder is lined up with your legs. The clicker is optional, but using that or a simple word will help in the reward phase.Clickers can be found in most pet stores.
You want to get in the habit of rewarding the correct position frequently so the dog remembers it.
Deliver the treat near your leg in the area you want the dog to walk.
 During a leash walking exercise, if your dog walks out ahead, try turning around quickly and getting the pet's attention.Do something such as calling the dog's name and moving in the opposite direction to get the dog to follow you.
When the dog catches up, and assumes the heel position, use the sound and treat reward technique.
 Once the dog is reliably walking by your leg into position then you can add the command word.Do this in low distraction areas at first.
You might want to try this in your home before attempting it on a walk outside.
Remember to reward the correct behavior and position with the clicker/word and treat.
 This should be a simple command like "free dog" that lets the pet know he can walk again.Work this into the training of the heel command.
Don't allow this to ruin the leash control you have over the pet.
 Do this during the heel training of each dog.This will teach the dog to respond to the command and not just expect a routine.
Remember to use the reward techniques for correct behavior.

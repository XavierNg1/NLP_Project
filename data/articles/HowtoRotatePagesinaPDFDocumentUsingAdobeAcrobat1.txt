 Use one of the following methods:


From the Tools menu, select Pages, and then Rotate.
From the Options menu in the Page Thumbnails panel of the navigation pane, choose Rotate Pages.
 Select the amount and direction of the rotations: Counterclockwise 90 Degrees, Clockwise 90 Degrees, or 180 Degrees.
 For Pages, set whether you want all pages, a selection of pages, or a range of pages to rotate.
 From the Rotate menu, specify even pages, odd pages, or both, and select the orientation of pages to be rotated.


Note: these settings are important to enable rotation of any page in the document, independent of its page number or orientation. For example, if you have selected Portrait Pages from the second Rotate list, and if the selected page is a landscape page, the selected page will not be rotated.

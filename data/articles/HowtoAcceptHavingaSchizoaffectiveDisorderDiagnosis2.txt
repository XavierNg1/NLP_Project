 Schizoaffective Disorder manifests differently in different people, so your doctor needs to know you uniquely. If you feel that a certain symptom isn't being addressed well enough, say so.
 Take exactly the prescribed amount, and don't make any changes without consulting a doctor first.


Call your doctor if you are having trouble with side effects.
Ask a doctor or pharmacist if your medication is safe to use with over-the-counter medications (e.g. Tylenol, Aspirin, Pamprin, cough drops, etc.)â€”anything you use for ordinary ailments.
Avoid drugs or alcohol. These can interact and make your symptoms worse.
 Make sure that you read your instructions on your medication so you know what interacts with what.
 Medication also has to be in a comfortable cool dry place. Best place would to have in a lock box either the kind with the key or the touch key pads. Also schedule your refill day the same day every month so you don't forget it!


Keep medication away from the reach of children or animals.
 There are many antidepressants, and unfortunately there is no real way to tell what will work for which person. It may take weeks or months before you are able to find one that eases any depression symptoms you may experience without terrible side effects. It may work on the first try, the third try, or the sixth try.


See a doctor regularly when trying new medications, in order to discuss any side effects and depression symptoms.
 Psychotherapy and counseling may help you handle problems and learn to adapt. You may also want family or group therapy to help your loved ones know how to help with your symptoms, and to work on any problems.

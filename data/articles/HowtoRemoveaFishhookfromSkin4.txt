 The advance and cut method is more aggressive than the previous two and may involve higher levels of pain. For your comfort, and if available, apply a topical anesthetic to the wound site to dull any potential pain.Look for a topical gel, ointment, or cream. In the US, some brand names include Xylocaine, Lidoderm, Sting Kill, and Polar Frost.
As always, make sure that the wound area is clean and dry before application. Read and follow the anesthetic’s instructions for use and recommended dosages.
 The advance and cut method is nearly always successful. However, its main drawback is that it damages the tissue more than the retrograde and string-yank techniques. The hook should only be advanced if the point of the hook is already near the skin surface; otherwise additional damage to deeper structures can occur. Use a needle holder, hemostat, or needle-nose pliers to grasp the hook.
 Rather than just pulling out the hook along the path of entry, this method requires you first to push it forward through the tissue and out of the skin, then to remove the barb.


Wear goggles or some form of eye protection, as the barb is small and can fly when cut.
Push the hook forward until the barb emerges.
Next, take pliers, wire-cutters, or another cutting tool and clip off the barb from the fishhook.
Be sure to re-stabilize the hook before you cut it.
 With no barb, the fishhook will not tear or rip tissue as you remove it. You can now draw it out safely, as in the first two techniques.Slowly pull on the hook and guide it backward along the original path of entry and where you pushed it forward through the skin.
 There is a variant of the method that involves cutting off the hook’s eye rather than the barb. In this case, clip the eye after you have advanced the hook through the skin.


Then, continue to push the hook forward and draw it out, rather than pushing it backward through the original entry wound.

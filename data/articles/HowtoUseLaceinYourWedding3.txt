 A skilled baker can frost a wedding cake in a way that resembles lace. If lace is a theme at your wedding, talk to a baker about a lace-themed wedding cake.This may work better if you're using white frosting. It may be hard to get darker colored frostings to look lace-like.
A lace wedding cake can pair well with a reception that heavily uses lace for decorations.
 If you have seating cards with people's names, embellish them with lace. Glue bits of lace to seating cards or glue a lace bow to them.This can work well if you have leftover lace. If you, for example, used lace bows for the seats at the wedding and have lace leftover, use it for the seating charts.

 Lace table runners are an easy way to add lace to the reception. At each table, have a delicate lace table runner running down the center of the table.If you're not a fan of table runners, you can use lace tablecloths instead.

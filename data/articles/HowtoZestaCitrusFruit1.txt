 Before you get started, run the fruit under a stream of cool water, then buff it gently with a clean cloth or paper towel. A light rinse will help remove the natural waxy residue on the outside of the fruit. You can also give the citrus a quick soak in a shallow bowl of water.It’s important to wash citrus fruit any time you’re zesting, since the outside is the part that will actually be going into your food.
Be sure to remove any stickers or labels so they that don't end up in the zest.;
, After rinsing or soaking the fruit for a few moments, shake off the excess water and pat it with a towel. Make sure the citrus is completely dry—you’ll be holding onto the fruit by hand, and you may slip if the peel is too wet.A microfiber towel will help remove more moisture from the outside of the peel.
 Graters, peelers, and paring knives will perform the same basic function, but one may produce a zest that’s better suited to your culinary needs than the other. A microplane grater is the way to go if you want a finely shredded zest that blends seamlessly into sauces, desserts, and other recipes. With a peeler, you’ll end up with slivers of a uniform size and thickness. Slicing citrus fruits by hand will result in an irregularly shaped peel, but offer you more control over the depth of your cut.Any knife with a short, sharp blade will work just fine when you don’t have a more expedient zesting tool on hand.When using a peeler or paring knife, you’ll need to go back and chop the peel to an appropriate size later on.

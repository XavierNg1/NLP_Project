 Yes, you can query more than one agent at a time. Just be sure to personalize each query and only solicit one agent per literary house. Note: make sure your first chapter is dynamite. Some agents request a first chapter along with your query letter. This is your chance to impress. You need to make the most of it.
 Follow submission instructions closely. At this point it is perfectly acceptable to ask for a reading timeline. A reputable agent should respond to a manuscript within 2-3 months.
 If you do receive an offer of representation, the agent will want to know what else you're working on. Think of it as a long-term relationship.
 If you get it, be prepared with a list of questions. Commission structure? Foreign rights? Editing process? You want to know exactly what you're entering into.

 For example, if you are a self-employed tutor designing an ad to attract college students, their needs may be to increase their knowledge and/or get good grades. Their beliefs might be that a good tutor has a degree and many years of tutoring experience in a specific topic.


Consider the type of ad that would attract your target audience. If trying to attract college students, a flyer posted on campus bulletin boards might be the best approach. When trying to sell a product online, the best ad type might be a visually attractive ad placed next to an online article about a related topic.
 If you're unclear about which type of ad to use, try several approaches to see which works best.


Develop a mechanism for finding out which ad attracted the most customers. Ask clients to tell you in an online survey, or verbally ask them how they found out about your product, services or event.

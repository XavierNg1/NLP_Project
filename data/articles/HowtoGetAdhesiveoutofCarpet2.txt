 Try to remove as much of the tape as you can.


If the tape has a strong hold, work slowly by pulling the tape with your hand. Try to get as many pieces as you can.
 Distilled vinegar can also be used to remove adhesive tape.


Pour distilled white vinegar into a cloth and wipe the area for at least a minute, being sure to adequately wet the area. Leave the vinegar on the spot for at least 15 minutes.You can also use equal parts water and vinegar if you prefer. However, you may need to leave the mixture on overnight.
The vinegar should cause the tape to start peeling off fairly quickly and easily.
Use a wet cloth to remove any adhesive and let the area sit to dry.
Be sure to use only distilled, white vinegar and test a small area before using the solution on larger areas.
 As an alternative to white vinegar, try using an iron.


Plug in the iron and set it to the highest steam setting. Place a paper towel over the spot. Then use a clean cloth to cover the paper towel. Once the iron has reached the proper temperature, simply iron over the cloth for approximately 10 seconds. Pull the paper towel and cloth back. The adhesive should have been transferred to the paper towel.
Use caution when working with a hot iron. Make sure you test a small area before moving on to a larger one.
The towel or cloth is important, as it helps to prevent carpet burns.
 If all else fails, call the professionals. Sometimes tape is simply too difficult to tackle on your own. If you’ve exhausted your cleaning options and still haven’t had luck, it may be time to call the professionals to steam clean your carpets.


Hire someone who is knowledgeable on adhesive removal and has had experience in doing so.
Inquire about the type of cleaning solution they will be using. Make them aware ahead of time if you prefer to only use environmentally safe cleaning products.

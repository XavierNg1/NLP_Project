 The origins of the modern-day Christmas can be linked back the tree of Thor that was cut down as an act of Christianity to prove the Norse Gods weren't real and there is only one true God.;
, Avoid things such as reindeer, Santa Claus, and similar items. Keep your household decorations more "spiritual" and relevant to the holiday. Good ideas include a nativity scene, depiction of angels, and stars. Candy canes can be used to represent the shepherds that were told of Christ birth. Images of Christs life can help you reflect on him this holiday season and the green represents His love year round, not just seasonally.
 Christ commonly sat with the beggars and sinners. Instead of purchasing gifts for family and friends that are hot trends, consider spending the money on gifts or donations that help them, like a Bible they can read about Christ's life, or new church clothing. Donate to charitable organizations for those less fortunate. Many families also choose to donate their time, as well as money, by volunteering in soup kitchens and homeless shelters.
 Avoid music and television programs that center on the more commercialized aspects of Christmas (again, such as reindeer, Santa Claus, and so on). Unfortunately, this may prove more and more difficult as time passes. Consider purchasing your own music and movies for your personal collection.

 These ready-to-use labels can be purchased at most stores. If you do not own these, cut up little rectangular pieces of paper and glue them on the binder with tape. On the label, write the following:


Name: ____________
Class:____________
Teacher:__________
Subject:__________

and a little note (on a separate label) that says: Please return if found, thanks.
By including this note, you are showing this binder is important to you.

;
, If you treat your binder badly, then papers may fall out and notes might get lost. Additionally, if you keep your binders cover messy, others may think it is not important, and may steal it to wreck it even more, or they won't bother to return it to you. Keep your binder neat.
 Go to the office and ask to announce it on the speaker. Say something like "There was a pink Hilroy binder lost Friday, October 7th at 1st period. It is a science binder. Please return to room 403". If you let the students/teachers know that it is missing, they will return it if they see it.
 Put a little sticker (that is noticeable) on the front and back cover of the binder, so you will recognise it. Do this with all your binders, so you recognize all of them. If you do not want to put a sticker on your binder, then you can simply write your name (big) with permanent marker on the top of the binder, so if teachers see it with another student (or if it is lost) they know who to return it to right away.
 This is how to do it


Put one binder from large end (the part with the rings) to small end (where binder opens and closes) on a table. Stack another binder on top of it from small end to large end, which forms a rectangle that is easy to carry, instead of carrying your binders messily, as they might fall out.
 Alternatively, ask if you are allowed to use your backpack to carry your binders in. This will keep your binders all together and easy to carry around. They will be safe, and by your side, so that they won't get lost

, What to do? You should keep your binders on top of your desk, under your chair, or you can sit on them (if they are strong). Alternatively, if you sit next to a window or cupboard, then place them on the top of the cupboard or on the window ledge.
 Make sure to try to hide them using clothing or stack your binders with a friend and cover them with clothing. Do not make a large pile or it will be obvious.

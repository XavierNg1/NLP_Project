 Chlorine – which is used to kill bacteria in pool water and keep it swimmable – will strip the natural oils that usually help protect your hair from damage associated with dryness and daily wear. The goal of swimmer’s hair treatment is maintaining a healthy level of moisture in your mane.The first must-do step is to shower immediately after your swim. Chemicals are beginning to damage your hair as soon as you jump in. Fight back as soon as you get out of the pool!
For added resilience, use moisturizing conditioner and shampoo.
Massage moisturizing hair products into your hair and scalp to ensure complete coverage of your hair.
A moisturizing “leave-in” conditioner can help making brushing go more smoothly.;
, If your hair sometimes changes colors – blondes may go a bit green, and darker-haired people may see their hair lighten in color – there are shampoos designed to specifically fights this effect.Mineral deposits such as copper are actually the culprits associated with color changes in your hair.
There are products specifically designed to rid your hair of copper before it sets in, such as chelating shampoos that lower the pH of your hair and remove the copper.
 Even hair products meant to treat swimmer’s hair may dry your hair out when you first begin to use them.Chlorine, for all its disinfectant glory, will bond to your hair, so you may need more than your run-of-the-mill cleaning products to get it out.
Use only enough hair product to get results, and don’t use strong shampoos too frequently.
Be sure to use a moisturizing conditioner following the use of a potentially harsh shampoo.

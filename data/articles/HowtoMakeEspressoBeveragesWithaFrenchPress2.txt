 Pour at least 1/2 cup of milk in a medium saucepan and heat on low or medium.


Heat the milk until it is warmed through. You don’t want your milk to boil. Heat just until it starts to bubble then turn the stove off.
The thicker the milk or cream you use, the thicker your foam will be. However, using 2% or low-fat milk may be easier if you are frothing by hand. Lower-fat milks usually include whey proteins that are critical stabilizers for milk foam.
 While the milk is being heated, make your espresso using the first method.


You can also heat the milk while the beverage is steeping.
 Do this while the coffee is steeping.


Place the pan on a towel or surface that isn’t hot but that won’t get damaged by the heat from the pan.
 Angle your pot and set an immersion blender in the shallow end of the pot. Froth the milk on high speed until the foam holds, about 2 to 3 minutes blending on high.


If you don’t have an immersion blender, you can use a whisk and stir the milk in a smaller container. Stir by rotating the whisk back and forth between the palms of your hands. Stir until your milk is bubbly and frothy.
 Once you’ve poured your milk, tighten the lid and give the jar a good shake. Don’t fill the jar more than halfway. This won’t leave enough room for the milk to foam.
Shake until the milk is bubbly and nice and foamy. You should be shaking for about 30 to 60 seconds.
Then microwave the jar (making sure you have a microwave safe jar) for about 30 seconds. This allows the foam to rise to the top.
 Divide the coffee out amongst the cups and spoon the frothed milk on top of each. Serve immediately.


You can also pour the leftover milk into your drink if you like milk in your drink.

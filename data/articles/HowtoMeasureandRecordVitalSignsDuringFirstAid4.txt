, It should be snub but not tight, and high enough so the cuff doesn't sit in the crook of the elbow. Make sure you can see the gauge.


Use the right size cuff for the patient. Children and obese adults require different sizes of cuffs.
 You may have to hunt around between the cuff and the elbow, or even place the diaphragm of the stethoscope slightly under the cuff.


You may need to inflate the cuff slightly to put enough pressure on the artery to detect the pulse.
 Listen for the pulse to disappear.
, Listen for the pulse to return.
 This is the systolic pressure, which is the pressure exerted on the arteries when the heart is pumping the blood.
, This is the diastolic pressure, which is the pressure on the arteries between heartbeats.
 First list systolic pressure, then forward slash, then diastolic pressure. An example of a blood pressure reading is 120/70, which you would read as "120 over 70."

, For subsequent blood pressure readings, use the arm that gives the highest reading.


Normal blood pressure for adults is a systolic reading of less than 140 mmHg and a diastolic reading of less than 90 mmHg. However, patients in distress may have higher pressures, and patients who are going into shock may have diastolic readings of less than 80 mmHg. Normal blood pressure readings for children vary by age.
Be aware that you may experience an auscultatory gap, when the pulse temporarily disappears, between the systolic and diastolic readings. If the reading you get isn't what you expect, try again.

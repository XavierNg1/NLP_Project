 Mix up water and baby shampoo, or any liquid soap, in a large bucket or dish.;
, Get your straw, or your choice of "bubble wand", and dip it in the "bubble juice". There should be a film of the solution at the end of the straw. Carefully move the straw near your plate.
 Blow a bubble of any size, just make sure it can fit on the plate. Don't blow it directly onto the plate; blow it right over the plate.
 Carefully place your bubble on a plate. Your bubbles may pop several times before you can finally put one onto a plate.
 Put the dish very gently inside a freezer. Wait for about 30 minutes to an hour, checking on your bubble every 15 to 20 minutes.
 When your bubble is frozen, take out the plate very gingerly, making sure it does not crack. It will last for about 10 minutes, more or less.

 Search “Samsung Kies” on a new web browser tab or window. Select the official Samsung website from the results.


On the home page, going down, you can find two versions of Kies for Windows (Kies 3 and Kies 2.6) and one version for Mac (Kies 3). Download the installer according to your computer’s OS.
Install Kies by locating the installer on your computer and double-clicking it. Follow the instructions on the installer wizard.
 Double-click the Kies shortcut on your desktop or click it from the Programs menu.
 Use your device’s USB cable to connect it to your computer. Kies will automatically detect your device and will show on the left sidebar.
 At the top of the left sidebar, click “File” then “Import iTunes Playlists to Library.” From the Library directory that appears, click “New Playlist.”

, When Kies has imported the music playlist from iTunes, you can find the music playlist in Kies Music library.


Note that songs purchased on iTunes might be DRM protected, which Galaxy will not be able to play. You will know which songs are DRM protected, as they will have DRM in their file name in the Kies window.

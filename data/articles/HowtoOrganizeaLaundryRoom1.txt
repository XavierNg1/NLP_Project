 Dirty clothing can quickly overtake a laundry room, making it seem drab and unorganized. Try positioning several laundry baskets in the room, with each one dedicated to a particular type of laundry. For example, you could sort laundry into a basket for white clothing, one for colored clothing, and one for household laundry like sheets and towels.;
, Keep your sweaty running shorts and muddy gardening socks separate from the rest of your clothes. Try placing a canvas bin on the floor and tossing grimy items directly in the bin.
 Try hanging a shower curtain rod in the laundry room. A rod will provide a space for hanging wet or damp clothing. Try positioning a shower curtain rod above the washing machine, and use it for hanging up clothes that need to air dry.
 Make sure each member of your family has their own laundry basket. Place clean laundry in personal baskets, and ask each family member to retrieve the basket and put away the laundry. Store empty baskets on a shelf. Try baskets with fun, attractive designs to prevent folded or dirty laundry from becoming an eyesore.

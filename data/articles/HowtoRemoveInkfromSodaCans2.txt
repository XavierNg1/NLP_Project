 Get a tough abrasive that can scrape the paint off the can. Steel wool or sandpaper may be able to do this for some aluminum cans. You can pick up these supplies at most department and hardware stores.
 If you want a quicker and easier way to sand, you can use a hand sander or mechanical sander to remove the paint from your can. Using a mechanical sander will save you some time and effort.


Hand sanders typically cost anywhere from $60 to over $100.Always read the manual before using a piece of electronic equipment.
 Hold the can in one hand and use the sander to scrape away the paint from the outside of the can. This process will require more force if you're using a non-mechanical sander or piece of steel wool. Continue to sand until all of the paint is off. If you don't need your can to be intact, you can empty it out and cut it down the side, roll it out, and tape it to a piece of cardboard. This may make sanding it easier.


A can that's full is much easier to handle because it won't get crushed as you sand it.
 You can use stronger sanding equipment, like a handheld sandblaster, to remove the paint from the surface of your can. Secure the can to the ground outside using duct tape and blast the can with your sandblaster. Once one side is shiny, rotate your can and continue sandblasting it.Use safety goggles and gloves when using a sandblaster.Some sandblasters with high pressure can break or destroy your cans if you sand them. Use a lower pressure sandblaster to avoid this.
Use an empty can when using a sandblaster to remove the ink from the can.

 In between classes or at recess, do something physical. Your breaks will be especially beneficial if you switch from your brain to your body at various points throughout the day. This will help get rid of the ants in your pants and rejuvenate your mind for consistent learning.Even if only for five minutes, find a corner where you can stretch or do a few yoga poses.
Get the heart pumping by doing 10 pushups and 20 jumping jacks.
 Treat your weekends as breaks from school. Though you may need to catch up on some homework, don’t let school responsibilities dominate your weekend – or the weeks will only continue to drag on and on. Plan something fun – and, if possible, physically active – every weekend.


Invite kids who you don’t usually hang out with to join in on group activities. You may wind up with a new friend, a new study buddy, or both!

, One way to ensure you’re always busy and socially engaged is by taking advantage of the extracurricular opportunities offered by your school. Join a sports team for an especially fun way to meet friends, stay healthy, and occupy your time constructively.


Another great option is joining the school band. The ability to play an instrument is likely one that you’ll enjoy the rest of your life, and there’s something especially fun about band people.
 At the very least, make a point of saying hello to other kids in the hallway. Another trick to having more fun and being more social at school is taking advantage of silly holidays or other chances to add some spice to the day.


If one of your classes is having a special event, or your school is holding some sort of soiree, dress the part.
Not only is dressing up more fun than you might think, it’ll firmly place you in the fun crowd at school.

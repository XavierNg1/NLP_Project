 Take your time, as rushing can affect the quality of your platters. Remember that quality is more important than quantity. Even if you need to make a lot of plates, it will be more time consuming in the long run if you have to redo any.;
, Be sure that every area the mints may touch is covered by paper, or you may be unable to remove your plate from the pan when the time comes!

Tin foil may be used, but it will be extremely difficult to remove from the platter and you may end up with pieces on your plate - or a broken plate from trying too hard to remove foil bits!







, The mints should be touching or very close together. Use as many or as few peppermints as you like to create plates and platters of different sizes.



Be Creative! Put some of your peppermint candies in a specificÂ pattern or with different colours or shapes.
 If you move the candies in the slightest, gently take the pan out, move the candy back to your preferred position, and place it back into the oven.
 Turn on the oven light if possible or leave the door cracked and do not leave the room. Watch closely - the candies may take a few minutes to melt but once they have started to they will do so quickly. If you aren't careful you won't remove a peppermint plate but an ugly red mess!

Mints should look flat and appear melted together when it is done.
 This will take several hours, and allowing it to cool overnight would be even better. Do not put the pan in the refrigerator or freezer to help speed this along. Your pan will be ruined.

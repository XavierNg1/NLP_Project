 If you are publishing your work, you may be concerned about possible legal ramifications for what you are writing. Satire makes fun of and mocks people, institutions, and businesses. It is inevitable that people may find your work offensive or harmful and pursue legal action.


Writers in the United States are protected by the constitutional right to free speech. However this is not a guarantee in other countries. Be aware of the laws and regulations when you are writing outside of the United States.The victim must prove that your writing was an act of malice., It should be clear to the audience that you are not writing actual news and reporting facts. Your use of exaggeration, humor, and over the top language will indicate that you are writing satire. You could also include a disclaimer with your writing to avoid any legal action.Consider using fictional names or names that are close to the real names of people instead of using real names.
Publishing your satirical piece close to the time of the current event will also be helpful. This way the event is still on people's minds.
 There is a fine line between being funny and being offensive. It is expected that your writing will rub some people the wrong way, but you to do want to write things that are in poor taste. Do not purposely inflame religious, racial or social tensions.For example, it is more acceptable to write satire about a group that you are a member of. If you are a working mother, it may be more acceptable for you to write about the problems with maternity leave than a single man with no children.
It may be helpful to have someone that you trust read your writing before you share it with a larger audience.

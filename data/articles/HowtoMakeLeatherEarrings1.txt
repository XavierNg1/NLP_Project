 You will use cardboard to trace your patterns on your leather. Take a small piece of cardboard, such as cardboard from a shoebox, and draw a circle shape on the cardboard in pen.In order to make sure your circle shape is perfectly round, try tracing around a circle-shaped object such as a bottle cap.
After drawing your circle, carefully cut out the circle using a pair of scissors. Go slowly so your circle stays even.;
, On the back side of the leather, use a fabric pen to trace around your cardboard circle. Trace the circle twice, as these shapes will be your earrings.When selecting your leather, choose a color or pattern you like. If you want earrings for a red outfit, for example, use red leather.
 Use fabric scissors to carefully cut around each circle. Go slowly. You do not want to cut uneven circles for your earrings. This will make your final product look sloppy., Take a small hole puncher. Use it to punch two holes in either earring, near the top of your circles. This is so the circles will dangle downward when you put the hoops in.Use the smallest hole puncher possible. It's not necessary to have very large holes in your earrings.
 You can buy earring hooks at most craft stores. You will have to use pliers or your fingers to gently twist open the loop at the end of the hook. Fit the hook through the holes you made in each earring.Once you've fitted the loop through the hook, use your pliers or fingers to close the hook again.
Make sure you close the hook completely. You don't want your earrings to slip off and get lost.

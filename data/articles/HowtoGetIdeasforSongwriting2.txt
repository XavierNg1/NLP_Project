 If you have recently read a nice book or watched an interesting movie, you can always write a song about the story in it. Allow your song to tell the story. Bring in the melody to raise or lower the tension in the song. Perhaps, you may want to point out the climax and put it where you wish the suspense to be in your song (for example, the bridge). Every listener looks forward to listening to a story.
 One of the more sensitive topics that you may want to write about include life and death. However, life and death definitely have a lot of metaphors that can be used. If you use a dying tree to represent death and a seedling to represent life, then you can always write about the death of a certain person or the birth of a child with metaphors instead. Metaphors will make your song more interesting.
 Perhaps, while you are listening to songs by other artistes, you may find the inspiration to write about certain issues (e.g. racism, happiness, love). Allow the music to spark off something in you. However, you might end up 'blending' a bit of the songs you heard into your own songs, so try not to write songs while listening to songs by other artistes. You don't want to get into trouble with the law.

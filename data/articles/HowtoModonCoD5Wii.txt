 It doesn’t matter what weapon you have, as long as you have satchel charges to kill people.;
,,, If you see a window from the other side, you succeeded!

,, You can see if somebody’s coming through the door!

, Blow the charge!


No weapons need for this. However, it is good for sniping.
 Turn around and go to the long building at the end of the map. Go up the steps and in front of the window. Walk towards the pole holding up the overhang. press jump and A.
 Move back a tad. not too far or you fall off. now run and jump. the good sign is if you’re stuck.
 Good, now you’re under the roof. perfect for sniping without being found.
 Move towards the tree. If you have done it correctly, you will fall through it but not through the ground. Slowly edge around the tree. Now move through the brush. Get to the side of a house. jump on the side

, Now move along the edge of the house. Keep moving around the corner. Don't worry if you fall off. Just go the one empty space right below the one corridor that goes to the intersection, left going to Sniper tower.
 walk up the hill. Don't worry you're safe now. Off the map but no places to fall through. Now go down the hill until you see a house with a window. Jump & crouch combo through the window. You’re invincible for everything. This is the only safe place in all the COD 5 maps where you can’t be hurt by anything. Now people can’t kill you.

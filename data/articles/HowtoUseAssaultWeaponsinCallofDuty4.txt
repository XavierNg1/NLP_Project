 Once you reach level 4, create an M-16 class with a Grenade launcher or Special Grenade x3.(Flash-bangs blind your opponents but do not give hit indication. Stun grenades dramatically slow turn speed and give a hit indication.) For Perk 2 use stopping power or if you have a grenade launcher, use sonic boom but make sure you hit them in the head for a one burst kill. For Perk 3 use deep impact.;
, Use the M-16 for big maps like Overgrown, Countdown District etc. Use the AK-47 for small maps to medium maps like Vacant, Strike, Backlot etc.
 Use this class for medium maps such as Ambush, Backlot, and Pipeline. (The M4 has much lower recoil than the AK-47 making it more suitable for long range battles but the AK 47 does much more damage so it is better at closer range.)

, (Use with Bandolier, Stopping Power and Deep Impact.)

, Use with stopping power and steady aim, in a sub-machine gun fashion. Works well with silencers.
 It has lower or equal stats in every category, and it is not recommended that you use it unless you are attempting to unlock the Golden camouflage for the AK-47.

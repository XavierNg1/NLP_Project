 The thief will take the sports bike at 1003 Richman Street. If the random event has been triggered, you will see a dot on your radar that flashes blue and red. This indicates the decision you can make: help the victim or take the bike for yourself.


Since this event requires you to chase the thief, it is a good idea to take a fast vehicle.
This objective can be made easier by taking a car, such as a Comet or Infernus, instead of a motorcycle, since slamming into him with a car will eject him from the bike.;
, If you want to kill him, you can shoot him off of the bike with an SMG or Pistol. Otherwise, knock him off of the bike by driving into him.Once he is dead or away from the sports bike, exit your vehicle and get onto the bike.
 The random event can be completed either way. If you want to keep it, drive away from the owner. If you return the bike to the owner, you will not be rewarded.


To repeat this event, take the sports bike from the thief, then go back to the owner and shoot him or shoot near him to scare him.This will make the random event incomplete, and you can keep the bike. Returning to this location will trigger the event again, but you will have to wait several hours in-game for it to become available again.
If you decide to return the Pegassi Bati 801, you can still obtain it by purchasing it for $10,000 on the Southern San Andreas Super Autos website. The website can be accessed via any in-game computer or phone.

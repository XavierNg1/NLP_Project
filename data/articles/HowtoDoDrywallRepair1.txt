 The two commonly available joint compounds are lightweight and all-purpose. Lightweight compound dries quicker than all-purpose and requires less sanding.Joint compound comes in a variety of container sizes, but be advised that smaller containers may cost just as much as the larger ones. If resealed properly, joint compound can be kept for up to 9 months for other around-the-house repairs if you end up with leftover compound.;
, A joint knife and a metal straightedge will enable you to apply the joint compound smoothly and scrape away the excess, so the repair job will look professional instead of lumpy or uneven. Get a sanding sponge to even out the surface after the joint compound has dried.
 For big holes, you'll need a new piece of drywall to create a patch. Get backing boards, which hold the drywall in place, and purchase a piece of drywall large enough to fill the hole. You'll need paper tape and joint compound to smooth out the joints.
 The final step to repairing drywall is painting the repaired area so that it matches the rest of the wall. Use the same primer and paint you originally used to paint the wall.

 Pimples are caused when dead skin cells, dirt, and bacteria get into your pores and cause a small infection. Using warm water and a washcloth, gently wash you face with facial soap every night to keep your skin healthy and happy.
 Dry or cracked skin can easily lead to pimples. After washing your face, apply moisturizing lotion to promote good skin health and clear pores.


Moisturizers with oil in them can often cause more problems. These oils will stay on your skin and clog your pores.
 You can find a wide variety of face masks at pharmacies and large grocery stores. Mud, tea tree, and witch hazel masks can help lower inflammation in your face that leads to painful pimples.
 There are a variety of medications, creams, and lotions meant to limit acne or curb it completely. For example, some doctors prescribe birth control because it can limit the hormones that cause pimples to break out. Talk to your doctor or dermatologist about any medical solutions that might work for your body.

 There are many types of lettuce and greens to choose from. Use a variety of flavors and textures including iceberg and romaine lettuce as well as other greens such as chicory, arugula, escarole, radicchio, beet greens, watercress, and loose-leaf lettuces. Some stores and markets will sell their own mix of greens, which might be called mesclun mix or spring mix.
 Make sure the leafy greens are a rich, bright green. Other lettuces such as iceberg will have a lighter green color. Different varieties might also contain red colors, and a white or yellow stem. Make sure there is no browning or yellowing of the leaves.
 Most stores and markets provide spoons or tongs to pick up the loose lettuces. Use these to bag your greens. They should retain their shape and texture and not be wilted or too soft.
 Salad greens should smell sweet, and a little bit earthy. If they smell too bitter or dull, that is an indication of how they will taste in your salad.
 Tie or seal the bags, and keep them separate from your other groceries, especially raw meats and poultry items.
 The greens stay fresher in plastic tubs than they do in bags. They are often cheaper when you buy larger quantities in the tubs. Store them on the bottom of the refrigerator for longer shelf life.;
, The date printed is the date that the salad greens will probably begin to rot. Vegetables that are expired will not taste as good as fresh vegetables. Buy what you will be able to use in less than 1 week.
 Tubs and plastic bags are often transparent. Shake the container to make sure the salad moves freely, and look for any signs of rot or moldy lettuces.

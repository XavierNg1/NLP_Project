, When this happens, he should have his mouth open for you to throw the toilet paper into his mouth. Make sure you're standing on the C.S pad when this happens. If you miss, he'll restart the verse somewhere else and you'll have to try again.
 When he begins, run to the nearby uncovered C.S pad where the sweetcorn was before. Do exactly what you did last time and stand on the C.S pad when he hits a long note to throw it in his mouth.
 This should happen after you have put two toilet paper rolls in his mouth. At this point he will begin to sing his third and final verse. There should be a big gap for you to jump, and then use the last C.S pad. You'll have to be pretty accurate and fast because he'll speed up. Do this as quickly as you can.
 After you get three toilet paper rolls in his mouth, he'll sing a very high note and break the glass. This is when you toss in a final roll.

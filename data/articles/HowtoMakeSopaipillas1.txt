 You will need one package of dry yeast, 4 cups of flour, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbs sugar, 1 tbs melted shortening, 1½ cups of water, vegetable oil for frying, and your preferred topping.;
, Use the entire package of yeast and stir in the 1½ cups of water, allowing five minutes for the two to sit so the yeast can react.


Use warm water to mix with the yeast, instead of cold (which can slow the process) or hot (which can kill the yeast).
Sopapillas are created when the yeast forms gas and causes the inside of the pastry to puff up into a bubble.
 Melt the shortening before adding it to the yeast mixture, and stir well.


Traditional sopapillas are made with lard instead of shortening, although this is rarely used now. Feel free to use real lard if you have access to the ingredient.
If you don’t have shortening, you can substitute it for butter.
 Slowly pour each into the mixture as you stir slowly, fully incorporating each ingredient into the dough.
 Remove the dough from your bowl and knead it with your hands until it is very smooth.
 Place it in a greased dish and allow it to sit for around one hour or until it has doubled in size.
 Punch it down to remove the gas build up from the yeast, and roll the dough to be about ¼ of an inch thick.
 Start by making the dough into a large rectangle, and then cutting along the diagonals to form small triangles. Try to keep them less than three inches wide on their longest side.
 Fill a pot or pan with enough cooking oil to cover the sopapilla completely. It needs to reach about 400 degrees to be hot enough to fry the dough.
 Fry multiple sopapillas at once to quicken the time it takes to make them all.
 This should take about one minute per side, but the time is variable so watch them carefully.
 Place them on paper towels over a wire rack to drain off excess oil.
 Traditional toppings include cinnamon and sugar with honey, but powdered sugar, chocolate, and caramel are all delicious on top as well.

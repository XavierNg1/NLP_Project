 Add vegetable oil to medium saucepan until it reaches a depth of 2-inches (5-cm). Place a deep fry thermometer in the pan, and heat the oil on medium-high until it reaches 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).You can substitute canola or peanut oil for the vegetable if you prefer.
You can also use a candy thermometer to monitor the oil’s temperature.;
, For the fries, you’ll need 2 firm apples. Wash and core the apples to remove the seeds. Next, use a sharp knife to cut the apples into ¼-inch (6-mm) thick slices.You can peel the apples to remove the skin if you like, but it isn’t necessary.
 Add 1 cup (128 g) of all-purpose flour to a small shallow dish. Place the apples slices in the flour and toss to coat both sides.If you prefer, you can substitute whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour.
 Once the oil has reached the proper temperature, carefully drop the apples into the pan in batches. Allow the apples to cook for 2 to 3 minutes on the first side before flipping the fries and allowing them to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes on the other side, or until they are completely golden brown.Be careful when adding and flipping the apple fries. The oil will be extremely hot, so you can easily burn yourself.
 When the fries are finished cooking, use a slotted spoon to lift them out of the oil. Place them on a paper towel-lined plate to help absorb some of the excess oil., Once the apple fries have drained for a minute a two, transfer them to a platter. Dust the fries with ground cinnamon and powdered sugar to taste while still warm, and serve.You can eat the apple fries on their own, or serve them alongside ice cream, whipped cream, or caramel sauce for dipping.

 In a large pot, combine the vinegar, water, and salt. Place the pot on your stovetop and bring it to a boil. Simmer the brine for five minutes and then remove it from the heat. Allow it to cool for a few minutes., Thoroughly wash and dry the cucumbers and dill. Then place the pickles upright in a large mason jar. The pickles should come within Â½ inch (1.27 cm) of the top of the jar. Finally, insert the dill sprigs in amongst the pickles.You can also slice the cucumbers and pickle them as spears.
You can also add cloves of garlic, onion, or other vegetables to the jar for some added flavor.
 Once you have your cucumbers arranged, fill the jar to the top with brine. Be sure to tap the jar a few times on a flat surface to remove any air bubbles. Without canning, the pickles will be good for a few weeks. However, if you properly can them and do not open them, the pickles can stay good for a few years.Let the pickles set for at least 48 hours to get the best flavor.

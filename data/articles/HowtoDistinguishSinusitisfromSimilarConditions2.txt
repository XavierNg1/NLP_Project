 Sinus infections generally cause severe headaches, which can get confused with migraines. These headaches are felt around the sinuses. This includes around or behind the eyes, the cheeks, and the bridge of the nose. It gets worse when you bend over or cough.


Migraines pain can be more widespread, in the top or bottom of the head, and even in the neck. Sinus headaches generally donâ€™t affect the neck.
 Headaches due to sinusitis cause tenderness of the face. This is because the sinuses are swollen and tender. Gently press your fingers along your face around your nose, including your cheeks and above your eyes. Sinusitis causes this to be sore or swollen.You may also feel pain or tenderness in the jaw or your teeth.This area of your face may also be redder than usual.
The pain for a migraine is usually a throbbing pain in the temples or back of the head, and generally not a tenderness of the face., Migraines are often accompanied by sensitivities to stimuli. This may include being sensitive to bright lights or sunshine. Any sound may make your headache worse. You may find it difficult to keep your eyes open and need to lie down to help the pain go away.This sensitivity may be accompanied by feelings of nausea or vomiting. The pain or the lights and sound may trigger you to feel sick to your stomach.
Sinusitis doesn't generally cause any sensitivity or reaction to stimuli. Sinusitis usually gets worse if you cough or hang your head down., Migraine headaches have a very specific duration, whereas a sinusitis headache is more unpredictable or chronic. Migraines last for a few hours and then go away after taking headache medication. Symptoms will go away with a migraine, whereas your face will still be sore even if the sinus headache has subsided.Migraines are generally a recurring problem. They have a very similar pattern, last around the same amount of time each time, exhibit the same symptoms, and go away with the same treatment.

 Wait for the right wave to come your way.
 While paddling toward land, let the wave meet your body.


Once you're riding the wave, stop paddling your arms, but keep your legs moving.
If you want to simply ride to shore, stretch your arms out in front of you and let the wave carry you toward the beach.
If you want to ride with the wave, keep one arm out in front and use your other arm behind you to control your body. Your arms should work together, the front arm to "aim" your body and the back arm to keep it from arching out of control. Having that hand out front will also protect your head from potentially hitting the sand. , At this point you should be riding the wave, either with it or against it, working your way toward shore. Keep your body rigid if you want to go faster, but don't go too fast without learning the basics first.
 If you feel yourself moving out of control, you'll want to leave the wave as quickly and safely as possible. Leveling out or tucking and rolling out the back of the wave are the easiest ways to escape and swim to shore.

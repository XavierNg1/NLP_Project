For extra chocolate-y ice cream, use chocolate almond milk instead.If you don't like almond milk at all, you can use another type of milk instead, such as soy, of lactose-free cow's milk.
For extra goodness, add 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of almond butter., From time to time, you will need to open up the food processor, and push the mixture down the sides using a spatula. This will help ensure that everything mixes evenly.
 Try to get vegan chocolate chips, if you can. If you can't find any, use baker's chocolate chips instead. They are made from cocoa and may taste a little bitter, but they don't contain any dairy.
 You can use an old ice cream container or even a plastic tub with a lid.
 This will harden the ice cream enough so that you can scoop it out. If you are making this ice cream ahead of time, it may be too hard to scoop the next day. If that happens, let it sit on the counter for about 10 minutes until it softens enough to scoop., You can serve it as it is, or you can top it off with extra goodies, such as cocoa nibs, sprinkles, or crumbled nuts.

 Be certain when selecting cover to avoid the overly translucent; transparent places should be avoided at all costs.;
, If you are hiding behind a rock, standing up is probably not a good idea.
, What can he/she see? What are the lighting and obstacles that he/she is looking at from his angle? Understanding your target is essential. By putting yourself in their shoes, you can tell what they can and can't see.
 Take care not to make it too obvious. Take time researching as much as possible about your target location to decide if it is the best for hiding purposes.
 The smaller you are, the less there is to be seen.
 Remember that being seen is more than just visual; if someone hears you, then he/she will look directly at the sound, which will give you away.
 Even if you tell a well-trusted friend, he/she may spill the beans about where you are. Control of information is critical to secrecy. Find out where everyone else is, and keep your own information secret.
 Be like others and no one will recognize you. If you are in a large crowd, sometimes anonymity is better than secrecy. In that case, know the crowd, and act/look/sound like everyone else.
 Once you've looked someone in the eye, they'll be attracted to examine you further.

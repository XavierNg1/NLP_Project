 One of vitamin D's primary functions is to help calcium absorption in your system. This is important because calcium is necessary for bone growth and bone remodeling, which are constant processes in the body. Vitamin D is also needed to prevent rickets in children as well as osteomalacia (softening of the bone) and osteoporosis (brittle bones) in adults.


Vitamin D also contributes to the proper functioning of the immune system as well as cell growth and cell regulation.
Low levels of vitamin D also can increase the risk of pancreatic and colon cancer, autoimmune disease, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, insulin resistance (pre-diabetes), and multiple sclerosis., There are some people who are more at risk for vitamin D deficiencies. This means if you are one of these individuals, you need to pay more attention to how much vitamin D you get everyday. The people more at risk include:Breastfed infants
Older adults
Anyone with limited exposure to the sun
Individuals with darker skin
Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or any other condition with fat malabsorption
Overweight people, obese people, or those who have had gastric bypass surgery

, In general, 50 nmol/L of vitamin D in your blood is considered to be at healthy levels. Values lower than this are considered low, which means you need to up your dose. A doctor will generally suggest food and sun with additional supplementation if needed, though supplementation is recommended after. Keep in mind that vitamin D, like other fat-soluble vitamins, can be toxic at high levels. This means you can have too much, which is not good for you.


Excess vitamin D can cause anorexia, weight loss, and heart problems.

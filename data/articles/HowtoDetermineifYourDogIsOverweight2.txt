 Try to take your dog outside to play fetch, run around, for a walk, or take your dog to the dog park. If your dog is reluctant to get up, lags behind, or stops or lies down frequently on your outings, then your dog might be overweight.Additionally, sleeping a lot, lying around all day, or showing a general unwillingness to move, i.e., lethargy, are also signs that your dog is overweight.
 Dog’s that are overweight tend to have a waddling gait, for example, a rolling from side to side when moving. Also, dogs that are overweight have difficulty moving, or need someone’s help to move.Also observe the pace at which your dog moves and the duration of your dog’s moving. Moving slowly and/or not being able to walk or run for very long are symptoms of being overweight.
 Dogs that are overweight also have difficulty breathing. They might have respiratory distress, dyspnea, or need to make extra respiratory effort to breathe normally. An overweight dog might also have noisy breathing.For example, a harsh, rattling sound, i.e., stridor, wheezing, or crackling.

 If your Stargazer lily has been an indoor plant up to this point, you can still move it outdoors and expect it to thrive. Choose a sunny spot if possible, although these lilies will tolerate a patch of garden that is in shade for part of the day.
 Stargazers aren't too fussy about the soil type but they prefer a well-drained soil. If your garden soil retains puddles easily, you may like to incorporate some compost or organic matter such as well-rotted manure into the ground to improve the drainage. The further ahead of planting you can do this, the better.
 It’s best to transplant an indoor Stargazer to the outdoors in the springtime, however you can do this at any time in the growing season from spring to late autumn.
 Remove the plant from its container being careful not to damage the roots or bulb. Make a hole around 5 inches (12.7 cm) deep and at least twice the width of your bulb.


If you’re planting more than one Stargazer lily, they should be spaced about 10 inches (25.4 cm) apart. Place the plant in the hole and cover the bulbs with soil.
Water well and apply a layer of mulch (grass clippings, straw or bark chips work well).
 If you’re in a climate which experiences cold, wet winters you might want to protect your Stargazer lily over the winter months by mulching, cloche protection or moving it back indoors over the winter.


If you choose to move your plant indoors for the winter, you may find Method 1 helpful when it comes time to replant your stargazer lily.

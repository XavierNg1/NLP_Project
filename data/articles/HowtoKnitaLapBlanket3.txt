 Ribbing is a simple way to add some flair and texture to a lap blanket. To create ribbing in a knit garment, all you have to do is alternate between knitting and purling.


For example, you could create ribbing by knitting 2 stitches and then purling 2 stitches. You would follow this pattern of knit, purl, knit, purl through the whole blanket and it would create a striped effect.
 The basketweave stitch is another simple way to add texture and interest to a lap blanket. To do this, you need to create small squares of knit stitches and purled stitches. These can be as small or as large as you want them to be.


For example, you could make squares that are 4 stitches by 4 stitches. You would simply follow a pattern of knitting 4, then purling 4. After four rows, you would switch the pattern so that you start with purling 4, then knitting 4, and so on.
 Cable stitches give knitting projects a twisting embellishment, and they are easier to do than they look.Making cables in your lap blanket will require a special cable needle and some practice to get the cable stitch down. However, it can add some pretty details to your project.


If you want to add cable stitches to your lap blanket, then you may want to use a stockinette stitch for the background. This will help to make your cables stand out more., If you want your lap blanket to have some texture and dimension, then this is a great way to accomplish that. Try practicing the seed stitch to ensure that you have it down before you use it.

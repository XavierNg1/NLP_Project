 It turns out that almost any nickel cadmium (NiCd, NiCad) battery with solder tabs will work just fine. To get such a battery, you can order one from any electronics supplier, McMaster-Carr, or many battery suppliers. The simpler way to get one (actually, two or three in most cases) is to buy a replacement battery pack for a cordless phone -- these are available locally at most any place that sells cordless phones.
 Your task is to take the pack apart! Remove a strip of plastic and pop the two cells (connected together) out of the carrier. Pry the two cells apart a bit to expose the connection at one end between the two cells. Cut the strip with some scissors (you don't really need wire cutters, but that is the proper tool)., These will be the connections to the ER203 later., There are two screws under the clipper and one at the base near the cord socket. A very small Phillips screwdriver is needed for these screws., Try to keep the depth adjustment knob in the clipper or at least note its position., It is held only by the posts at each end., I found that putting the bent tab in with the bend first and aligned vertically worked best. The other end of the battery goes in the same way but the bend in the tab may be 90- or 180-degrees off from the "top" of the battery -- just make sure the tab contacts the clip that held the post on the old battery. I did have to use a bit of force to get the battery fully inserted (not more than finger pressure!) as the original battery is just slightly shorter than a standard AA with solder tabs. Soldering is not necessary!, The only tricky part about reassembly is the depth knob. Make sure it works for the full adjustment range before tightening the screws., Once charged, you should be ready to trim for another few years.

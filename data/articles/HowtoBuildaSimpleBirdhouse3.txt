 Look in thrift or antique stores; or, maybe you have one in your house. It can be made from any materials, provided the material is safe for birds.


Wash and clean out the container. Allow to dry thoroughly before using.
 Stuff old rags or similar into the spout, to prevent drafts from whistling up it. Then seal off the entrance inside of the jug or pitcher with a block of wood or similar safe item.
 Hang in place from a rafter or similar position, away from drafts or winds.
 That's it. It's now ready for a bird to move in.

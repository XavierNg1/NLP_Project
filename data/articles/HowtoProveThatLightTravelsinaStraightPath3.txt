 This experiment will illustrate that light travels in a straight line in the air but it will bend when it hits a certain surface, like water and oil. To conduct this experiment, you will need:A large glass jar.
Access to water.
One cup of oil.
A ruler.
A spoon.
 Fill the jar halfway with water.


Make sure the jar is large enough to fit the ruler.
 Spoon oil into the jar so it forms a solid layer of oil on the surface of the water.
 Position it so it is vertical in the water and you can see the numbers on the side of the ruler.


Note that the numbers appear stretched or magnified as the light rays bend in the oil and the water. Move the ruler from side to side to note the different appearances of the ruler numbers in the oil and in the water.
This will show that light travels at different speeds in different mediums, such as air, oil, and water. It will travel in a straight line in the air, but it will bend when it changes speed due to contact with a certain medium, like oil or water.

 In almost all states, the court can intercede and allow a minor to marry without consent. There must be extenuating circumstances, however, such as:Pregnancy of the under-aged bride
Potential for abuse of the minor if parental consent is sought
Other things about the well being of the bride, groom, or children

, In many states, a person who has not reached the age of majority must have a “next friend” or guardian ad litem file papers to open a case on their behalf. This shows the court that at least one adult believes your request has merit. A next friend usually must be:A legal adult
A resident of the state
In some states, the next friend must also be a relative of the minor petitioning the court

, The requirements and process will go something like this:The next friend files the petition and schedules the hearing
The minor (often with the next friend) appears in court, telling the judge why the judge should grant permission for the minor to marry without obtaining the consent of the parent(s)
The judge makes the ruling, either granting or denying the request.

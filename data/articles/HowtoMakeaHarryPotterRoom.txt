 Hogwarts is mostly wood or stone, so you can paint it to look like either. But remember you may not like Harry Potter or Hogwarts later on in your life.;
, Know which house you're in because each Hogwarts dorm is decorated with the houses colors.


Gryffindor - Scarlet and gold
Hufflepuff - Yellow and black
Ravenclaw - Blue and bronze (Blue and Silver for the movies)
Slytherin - Green and silver

, Put up pictures of Harry Potter, posters of the film, fake potion bottles, a fake sword of Godric Gryffindor, spell book etc. You could also make a Hogwarts acceptance letter, and display it proudly on your wall.
 A toy cat, owl or toad would be great.



Use mugs and glasses with your house colors on them.
Use cauldrons instead of bowls and when having guests over serve drinks in the cauldrons.
 All you need to do with the bathroom is put a Girl or Boy sign

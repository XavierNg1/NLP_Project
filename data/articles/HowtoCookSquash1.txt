You can cut up and roast thin-skinned summer squash without peeling it.
If you want to roast winter squash in bite-sized pieces, then you should peel it with a sharp knife.
If you want to roast larger pieces of winter squash, simply slice the squash in half. Then, use a spoon to remove the seeds. Prick the skin with a fork to prepare it for roasting.



Spread small pieces of squash in a thin layer over the bottom of a roasting pan and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Drizzle them with some olive oil. 

If you're roasting a large winter squash, sprinkle the cut side with salt and pepper and drizzle it with a bit of olive oil. Place both halves of the squash, skin side down, on a metal roasting pan sprayed with cooking spray.
 Thin-skinned squash cut into small pieces will roast in about 20 to 30 minutes. Thicker-skinner squash cut in large pieces will take 30 to 45 minutes to roast.
 The flesh should be tender and easy to pierce with a fork.
 Add salt and pepper if needed.
 Scoop small pieces onto a plate alongside your main dish. Large pieces can be served individually, or you can scoop out the filling and mash or puree it.

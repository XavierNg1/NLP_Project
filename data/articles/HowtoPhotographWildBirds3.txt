 Some things that are helpful to know are:


Most birds take off and land into the wind. Anticipating that, be aware of the direction of the wind.
Watch for the birds to 'tense' their feathers. When they are relaxed, they are relaxed and won't be taking off. Most of them will tense before taking off.
 Birds move swiftly and without warning. Be ready for fast movement and antics.


When getting ready to shoot your subject, anticipate the bird's actions and be ready to pan.
 Captive to caring for their nest, you can get some fantastic shots if you know of a nest of birds somewhere. Be careful not to disturb the nest in any way.

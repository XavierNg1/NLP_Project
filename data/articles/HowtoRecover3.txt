 Stretching after a workout loosens your muscle fibers and kickstarts the recovery process. This is incredibly helpful if you plan on working out the next day as well, so take your time and stretch each muscle for 2-3 minutes.
 You need to start rehydrating immediately to prevent cramps and give your body time to recover. Drink 2-3 glasses of water in the hour after a workout, and keep drinking a glass an hour for the next few hours as well.
 Muscles are made of protein, and they rebuild themselves with protein. Supplying your body with good, lean protein gives it the building blocks necessary for recovery Some foods to try include:


Protein shakes
Eggs
Chicken
Tuna
Peanut butter.
 Ice limits swelling, which can drastically shorten your recovery time between workouts. To avoid frostbite, always keep a towel in between your skin and the ice.


Apply the ice as follows: 20 minutes on, 40 minutes off.
 Take time off of a muscle group, especially when lifting, to prevent injury. Your body needs time to recover and build new muscle tissue before being exerted again. If you did all chest exercises one day, consider doing leg lifts the next.
 The best thing you can do is stop moving. This allows your body the time it needs to rebuild and recover, so don't feel bad about turning on Netflix right after a tough workout. If you need to work out again soon, limit your activity to the basics and give yourself recovery time.


Going for a walk or a light jog is a great way to get your blood moving without causing undue strain.

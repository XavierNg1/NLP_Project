 Tell the person that you are not okay with being kissed. Inform them that it makes you feel very uncomfortable and that you have made a pact to avoid being kissed ever, by anyone. That way, you can make it clear that it's not personal to the person you're avoiding a kiss from but that you apply it every person.
 Inform the would-be kisser that you aren't in the mood for actions of affection today and would prefer that that no touching occurred.

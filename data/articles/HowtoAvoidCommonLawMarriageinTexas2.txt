 Without evidence to the contrary, living together can be construed by others as evidence that you and your significant other are married.
 When you and your significant other decide to live with each other, you both need to make sure you do not sign any document as husband and wife. In order to make sure you are not living together as husband and wife, never sign a real estate agreement that contains the following language:


"Husband and wife."
"Mr. and Mrs. ."
"We sign this real estate agreement as a married couple."

, When you and your partner move in together, make sure you discuss your relationship status with your landlord or your real estate agent and make clear that you are not a married couple.

 On the bottom, grab the deck with your thumb at your first knuckle. The top edge of the deck fits into the crease. The tip of your thumb should overhang just a bit below the deck.

, On top, grab the deck with your first, middle, and ring fingers wt your first joint (the joint right after your palm). Your fingers will drape over the deck. Bring them close together so that you can pinch the deck firmly, bending it back into your palm.
 You'll get a hill-shaped deck, with little pockets of air between the cards as they bend upwards. Having air pockets creates space in the deck that allows the cards to fall one by one, instead of in chunks.
 Turn the deck so that the bottom card is exposed and your longer edge of the deck is on top.
 This is the only part that could take some practice. You want your hand to open up even and straight. Your thumb and fingers should slide apart at the same rate, though it will takes some practice to figure out just how fast this is.









Note: This trick cannot really be performed slowly. It looks best with a quick but fluid motion.

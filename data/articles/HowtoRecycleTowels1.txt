For a solid bath rug, layer and stitch two same-sized towels together. Stitch the edges together, then make two crisscrossed stitches across the towels. Stitch seam binding around the edges for strength and support. Try two different colors. Use seam binding of the same or contrasting color.
For a patchwork bath rug, stitch several squares together or make a striped pattern. Combine and finish in the same way as the solid bath rug. You can attain an exact fit for the bathroom floor.;
, Use an area of the towel that is less worn. Using a sewing machine, make a zigzag stitch on all edges. You can attain the exact size and shape you'd prefer.
 Layer and stitch two same-sized facecloths together. Stitch the edges together, then make two crisscrossed stitches across the facecloths. Stitch seam binding around the edges for strength and support. Try two different colors. Use seam binding of the same or contrasting color.
 These do not need a finished edge. Cut all edges with pinking shears and re-cut frayed edges as needed.

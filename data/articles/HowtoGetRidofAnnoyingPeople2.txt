 It’ll be a lot easier to get out of a conversation if, at the beginning, you make it clear that you can’t be around for long. Tell him that you have an appointment or a call that you need to make. Tell him specifically that you have five or ten minutes left, so that he won’t be surprised when you bolt., Most people will get the clue if you begin to pack up your bags and start looking off in the distance. Conveying that you need to leave with body language saves you an awkward conversation and convinces the other person that they have decided to stop talking to you., If you’ve told someone that you have a timetable to leave, you’ve begun to pack, and they still haven’t responded, you might just need to tell them directly that you need to go. Try to be polite and pretend that you are sorry., Come up with a signal that you can send to a friend so that she will come over and pull you out of the conversation. Otherwise, just start talking to someone else in your vicinity. The other person should catch on that they’re no longer part of the conversation and eventually leave., If someone refuses to leave you alone, move to a crowded place and scream. Yell “leave me alone.” The fear that other people will intervene to protect you will cause even the most persistent people to give up.


This is an extreme solution. You should generally refrain from following this course unless you believe the person might endanger your safety.

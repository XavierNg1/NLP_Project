 Place a teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda in a small bowl. Slowly drop distilled water onto the baking soda, adding just enough water to form a paste. Use a spoon to carefully stir the mixture together.If you accidentally add too much water to the mixture and it becomes runny, sprinkle a little more baking soda into the bowl until you achieve a paste-like consistency.
 Once you’ve mixed up baking soda paste, target the areas where you have acne blemishes. You don’t want to spread it all over your face or you may dry out your skin, so just dot the paste on specific pimples. Let the paste sit on your skin for 15 minutes or until it is completely dry.Make sure that your hands are clean when you apply the paste to your face.
 When the paste has completely dried, wash it off with warm water. You may need to use a damp washcloth to completely remove the paste, but don’t rub too hard or you may irritate the skin. Pat your face dry with a clean towel.After washing off the mask, it’s a good idea to apply an oil-free moisturizer.

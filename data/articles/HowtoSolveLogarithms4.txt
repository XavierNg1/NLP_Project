 According to the second property of logarithms, known as the "quotient rule," the logarithm of a quotient can be rewritten by subtracting the logarithm of the denominator from the logarithm of the numerator. Written as an equation:


logb(m / n) = logb(m) - logb(n)
Also note that the following must be true:

m > 0
n > 0



, Before you can solve the logarithm, you need to shift all logs in the equation to one side of the equal sign. The other parts of the equation should all be shifted to the opposite side of the equation. Use inverse operations to accomplish this.



Example: log3(x + 6) = 2 + log3(x - 2)

log3(x + 6) - log3(x - 2) = 2 + log3(x - 2) - log3(x - 2)
log3(x + 6) - log3(x - 2) = 2



, If there are two logarithms in the equation and one must be subtracted by the other, you can and should use the quotient rule to combine the two logarithms into one.



Example: log3(x + 6) - log3(x - 2) = 2

log3= 2



, Now that there is only one logarithm in the equation, use the logarithms definition to rewrite the equation in exponential form, thereby removing the log.



Example: log3= 2

Comparing this equation to the definition , you can conclude that: y = 2; b = 3; x = (x + 6) / (x - 2)
Rewrite the equation so that: by = x
32 = (x + 6) / (x - 2)



, With the equation now in exponential form, you should be able to solve for x as you usually would.



Example: 32 = (x + 6) / (x - 2)

3 * 3 = (x + 6) / (x - 2)
9 = (x + 6) / (x - 2)
9 * (x - 2) = * (x - 2)
9x - 18 = x + 6
9x - x - 18 + 18 = x - x + 6 + 18
8x = 24
8x / 8 = 24 / 8
x = 3



, Go back and double-check your steps. Once you feel certain that you have the correct solution, write it down.



Example: x = 3

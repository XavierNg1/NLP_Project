 As a last resort, you can try to use streaming websites on your Android device. This can be difficult as most of these sites are not designed for mobile use and are often clogged with ads.


Some of the more popular sites include World Wide Internet TV, Live TV Cafe, and Stream2Watch.
 Most sites list all the programs that are currently playing, and you can use the search function to find exactly what you want. Many of these sites specialize in programming from across the globe.
 Clicking on a stream will usually open another tab that attempts to trick you into downloading something. Close the new tab to return to your stream, which may take a few moments to load.


The stream itself may be obscured by ads as well, and you will need to zoom in and hunt for the "X" buttons to close them.

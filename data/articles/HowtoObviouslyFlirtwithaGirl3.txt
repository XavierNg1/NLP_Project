 While it's okay to be bold, women will not take well to you being pushy. Pay attention to how she's responding. If she seems curt or closed off, back off. Continuing to flirt at this point will only bother her.If a woman is not returning your gaze or smile and doing things like crossing her arms during conversation, she's not receptive to your flirting.
 While touch is a great means of flirting, it's also a delicate matter. Everyone has their own space bubble and some women don't like to be touched right away. If she recoils from your touch, or gets quiet or uncomfortable afterwards, you have invaded her personal space. Go back to other flirtatious tactics and refrain from touching her again., It's great to compliment a woman in a respectful fashion, but steer clear from saying anything that could come off as sleazy. Stick to complimenting things like her smile, laugh, and eyes, and avoid overtly talking about her body.This is especially important if you don't know a woman. A woman may feel very uncomfortable if a strange guy is talking overtly about her body.

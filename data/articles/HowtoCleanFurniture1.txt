 Fill a spray bottle with water, then add a couple drops of dish detergent—liquid, not powder. A capful of white vinegar and a few pinches of baking soda in the mix will combat odor. Shake it up well., Dip a sponge into the detergent mixture and rub some of it onto the back or underside of the upholstery - somewhere where it is not likely to be seen. Wipe the spot dry with a cloth and then let it air dry completely. If any discoloration occurs, don't use the detergent mixture. Consider instead having the furniture cleaned professionally.

 The word Easter has its roots in "Eastre," which was the name of the Teutonic goddess of spring. Easter was originally a pagan festival that celebrated the beginning of Spring. The festival focused on fertility, and utilized the egg and the rabbit as symbols of the celebration. Early Christians adopted the pagan festival of Easter as a time to celebrate the risen Christ, rather than the goddess of Spring. Today, the vernal equinox still determines the date for Easter. In most Western countries, Easter is celebrated on the first Sunday following the vernal equinox, which is typically between March 22 and April 25.

 Try to get spills up as soon as they happen. Use a towel or paper towels to get as much liquid up as you can before trying to spot clean the area. You may need to hold the towel on an area or dab at it to soak up all the liquid.
 Wipe down any area that gets dirty, particularly on the plastic and metal parts. You can also wipe down the fabric.Try using a gentle cleaner, such as a natural cleaner or one part water to one part white vinegar. Dry it off, or let it dry before putting your kid back in the Pack 'n Play.


Always test the cleaner in an inconspicuous space first.
 If your mattress has a cover or if you slip a sheet on it, be sure to wash it often. Take it off, and throw it in the wash. Dry it thoroughly in the dryer, and then put it back on the mattress. Wash the cover at least once a week.

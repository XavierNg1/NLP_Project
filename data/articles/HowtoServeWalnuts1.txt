 Adding a few walnuts to any salad increases the salad’s fat content slightly. You need a little bit of fat in your daily diet, and adding walnuts to what’s otherwise a really healthy meal can help you get that daily amount without going overboard. Walnuts pair best with salads that include fruit and cheese.


For example, you can throw together some mixed greens, sliced pears (use fresh, not canned, pears for this recipe), dried cherries, and raw or candied walnuts to make a great salad.;
, If you’re tired of serving up plain vegetables, add walnuts to the recipe. In a lot of cases, the mild flavor of the walnuts actually enhances the flavor of the vegetables.


For example, you can toss ¼ cup (2 oz) crushed walnuts with blanched brussel sprouts, sautéed shallots, champagne vinegar, and Dijon mustard., Walnuts pair really well with cheese. Adding them to any cheese appetizer is a great way to punch up the flavor. It also adds a different texture to the smoothness of the cheese.


For example, you can top brie with roasted walnuts. Crush the roasted nuts into small pieces and serve them over the brie with a few tablespoons of honey and spices.For a more individual cheese dish with walnuts, stuff a date with one tablespoon of goat cheese, then stick a walnut half into the cheese. These are a great option if you’re looking for a way to serve walnuts at a less formal dinner or cocktail party because they’re easier for your guests to handle as they mingle.

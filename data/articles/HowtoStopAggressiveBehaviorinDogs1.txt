 If you have an aggressive dog, it is crucial to have adequate strong fencing around your property so that the dog cannot gain access to passers-by. Check your fence on a regular basis to make sure that there are no weak spots or holes in the ground through which your dog might escape and harm someone., On walks you must keep your dog on a strong leash so that you can control him with ease. You may want to consider a training harness as well to help you control your dog. It is crucial to have a strong leash and to be able to control your dog in case he should threaten other dogs or people., In addition to a leash and harness, your dog should wear a muzzle in public or whenever you have visitors. Look for a muzzle with a basket design so that your dog will be able to pant and drink. A basket design will also allow you to feed your dog treats through the muzzle, while still providing excellent protection from bites.To teach your dog to wear a muzzle put his favorite treat into the muzzle and hold it very still. Allow the dog to investigate and eat the treat. Do not attempt to fasten the muzzle at this stage.
Give your dog a treat and pop the muzzle over his nose while he's eating. Then remove the muzzle as soon as he finishes the treat.
After your dog has accepted this practice, put a treat in the muzzle again.
Then, after he has eaten the treat, put the muzzle on him and feed him treats through the muzzle. Wait a little bit between each treat so that your dog will begin to associate the muzzle with treats.

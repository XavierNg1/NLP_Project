 Are you definitely writing for the right fandom? Make sure that when you post it, it gets posted for the right fandom, too. If you're not a fan of Harry Potter, don't worry - there are dozens of other Fanfiction stories available.;
, Hogwarts founders? Marauders? Harry and his friends? Harry's kids? Once you have chosen, find out as much as you can about the characters at that point. Readers want your story to be consistent. There are thousands of websites about Harry Potter, and the books are readily available, so there is no excuse for not reading up on the characters.
 Are you following the books, filling in parts that J.K. Rowling didn't write? Or are you changing the setting or the characters? It's up to you. Remember, even if you write an Alternate Universe story, your characters still need to be in character, otherwise people won't want to read it. Make sure your story will interest others, not just you.


If you want to do a story in canon then make sure your facts are correct. Look on http://harrypotter.wikia.com or the Harry Potter Lexicon.
 A good story needs an interesting plot. Choose an interesting character, preferably a more obscure one that not many other people will have written about, and put them into a new situation. Spend a few pages writing out your plot. Or even just one page.
 That's what fanfiction is about.
 Long chapters are better than short chapters. That being said, don't write too much; sometimes enough is enough.
 Otherwise you end up with corrections instead of reviews. You don't want to distract from the plots.
 You won't be able to get it properly published because you don't own the copyright to Harry Potter. It could be a site that caters for many different fandoms like FanFiction.Net, Wattpad, Archive of Our Own or one that's specifically for Harry Potter.

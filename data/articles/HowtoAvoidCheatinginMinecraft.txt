 Play through the world, but focus on building a house. Try to get used to collecting materials the hard way, and try your best not to cheat.;
, Now monsters may be a problem. If you die and lose all of your items, try to get them back the hard way, even if you feel like you deserve to get those items back the easy way.
 When you are ready, start another world in survival mode, with cheats on, in hard mode.


The reason you should start up different worlds, rather than changing this option in the settings, is because, this way you can experience starting from scratch in different ways. Refrain from changing the difficulty levels in the settings on the same world, however, since that is a form of cheating.
 However, turn cheats off on your worlds this time. Now you will not be able to cheat, while previously you may have been tempted.
 Hardcore mode if you haven't died many times on your previous worlds, and you're feeling really brave. You will hopefully impress your friends, and hopefully yourself, if you use the hardest mode Hardcore mode. Just remember the #1 rule of hardcore mode - don't take any type of risk!

 On the search bar, type in www.yahoo.com to take you to the Yahoo home page.;
, On the Yahoo home page, click on the “Mail” button located on the top left side of the screen. A new page will load where you sign in with your Yahoo ID and password.
 Look for the small gear icon to the right, and click on it. Choose “Settings” from the drop-down list that displays to open up the main Yahoo Mail settings.
 A list of items will appear below these settings. Click on the fourth one down that reads “Vacation Response” to begin making your vacation response.


When you click on “Vacation Response,” the screen to the right of the menu will change.
 The first thing you can do is to add an “Automatic Response” for everyone to see. Just check the box that says “Enable during these days (inclusive)” by clicking on it. This will unlock the rest of the content.
 “From” is the day you want the automatic response to start to be seen. To change the dates, click on the three drop-down menus for month, date, and year. Below that, specify the “Until” date, which is when your automatic response stops showing. Just repeat this process for each drop-down, and select the date from the menu.
 Below “Automatic Response” is a section that reads “Send a different response to specific names.” Use this to set up different responses for certain people by clicking on the check box.


You have to type in the 1–2 domains you want to set up a different response for. Click on the boxes and type the domain name, such as your company business domain. Once you’ve decided on a domain, type in the customized response.
 When you’re finished typing your response, click on “Send sample to me” just below each vacation response, and log into your e-mail to see how your vacation response looks before it goes live. When everything is to your liking, just click on the blue “Save” button, and your vacation response is officially set!

 The top and bottom halves of level 197 are only separated by a single candy square, and vertical striped candies will be most effective at unlocking the meringue barriers located at the bottom half of the screen.To make a vertical striped candy, match four candies in a row of the same color, and move the last candy into the row either up or down in a vertical direction to complete the match.
When making vertical striped candies, try to create them near the center of the board, if possible. Detonating vertical striped candies near the center of the board will create one or more explosions that will increase your odds of completing level 197 within 50 moves.;
, When detonated, wrapped candies will clear the surrounding eight candies. There are 12 wrapped candies in the middle of the meringue barriers at the bottom half of the level, and starting in the middle can increase the opportunity for chain reactions that wipe out all locked meringues and jellies., When matched with another candy, a color bomb will wipe and clear all candies on-screen of the same color the bomb was matched with.


Match five candies in a row of the same color to create a color bomb.
 All the jellies in level 197 are located in the bottom section of the level, and matching candies in the top half may not help you complete this level unless youâ€™re making color bombs or vertical striped candies.

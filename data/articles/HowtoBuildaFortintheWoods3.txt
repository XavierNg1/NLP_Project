 The diameter does not matter too much, but around 2" is a good width. The length will determine the height of the ceiling, minus about 8".
 You'll need to drill holes through the pipes in order to join them together. Drill these holes roughly 8" from the top of the pipes. The holes should go through on one side and come out directly on the other side. The holes will need to be thick enough to get a string or rope through.
 String the rope through all of the holes and tie the ends together. It should be loose enough that the pipes can be turned and form the teepee shape.
 You can make a custom-fit covering (out of waterproof fabric) by measuring the average size of each triangular section and sewing together the correct number of panels. Just be sure to leave a door opening in one of them and a large hole at the top so that it can be fit over the poles.


Another option would be to get two or more tarps and wrap them over the poles, attaching them together with tape or cord. Again, leave an entrance.
 Decorate your fort as needed, making sure that the ground inside is great for sitting or sleeping on.

 If you see a dog that you think might be a Dalmatian and are curious about the breed, approach the owner and ask. For example, you could say something like “That is a beautiful dog. Is it a Dalmatian by any chance?” Alternatively you could say “What kind of dog is that? I really like its colouring.”


Most dog owners will be happy to tell you about their dog and the breed.
 If you are unsure of your dog’s breed or lineage, ask your veterinarian to help you identify the breed. Veterinarians will be familiar with most dog breeds and will be able to examine the physical characteristics of the dog to help with identifying the breed.
 If you are purchasing a Dalmatian from a breeder, you should talk with the breeder about the puppy’s parentage and lineage to make sure that you are getting a purebred Dalmatian. A licensed breeder will be able to provide you with paperwork that proves both parents are recognized as Dalmatians by the American Kennel Club.

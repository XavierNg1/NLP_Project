 People will keep coming if you have good events. Talk to your members about what kinds of activities they want to do, and plan for them. Vary your events -- some small and some big -- it’s easy to get burned out when you’re going from one big organizational challenge to the next. Make time for the group to get together and have some less-structured fun. Smaller events could be based more on bonding as a group rather than your larger mission, and could include:Making and eating a meal together
A trip to the movies
Rollerskating or ice skating
A trip to the zoo

, Even though you might be the one to have started the group and continue to lead it, you can’t do it all. Know when you need help, and ask for it. Be comfortable telling members the kinds of help that the club needs to do a task and having them sign up to assist. And when it stops being fun for you, think about letting someone else be in charge.

Make sure the group stays focused on the reasons they became a group and keep the organizational stuff to a minimum. Try to conduct as much of the bureaucratic necessities over email or Facebook beforehand, so the meetings can be reserved for discussions or activities.

 Look for something that says restructuring, repairing, nourishing, hydrating, or moisturizing on the label. These types of shampoos and conditioners are designed to add extra moisture, proteins, and vitamins to your hair, making it healthier and stronger. They won't necessarily seal the split ends back up, but they will help manage them and prevent the split from going further up the hair shaft.;
, Wash your hair as your normally would, but instead of using your usual conditioner, use a deep-conditioning hair mask. Do not rinse it out; instead, squeeze the extra moisture out of your hair and put it under a shower cap. Leave it there for 15 to 20 minutes, then rinse it out using cool water. If you can't find a hair mask designed specifically for split ends, look for something that says:


Deep repair
Hair repair treatment
Restorative

, Find one that has a conditioning agent and ingredients that gives hair a shine. Apply a generous amount of this serum to damaged split ends. Style the hair as usual. The serum works to help treat and smooth split ends. Serums for split ends will typically include anything of the following on the label:


Split end cream/mender
Pure oil treatment

, You will need to find a certified salon to get this treatment. It will take about 10 minutes, and is most effective right after a haircut or trim. The combination of product and gentle heat styling will help seal the split ends for up to four weeks.

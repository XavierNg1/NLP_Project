 You'll find the icon among your frequently-used applications or wherever you've chosen to store it (e.g. in your Dock or on your desktop). Click the icon to open the browser.
 Begin by clicking "Safari" on your browser's toolbar. Then select "Preferences" from the dropdown menu that subsequently appears.
 First, click on the "Security" tab. Under the "Web content" section, you'll see a box next to "Enable JavaScript." If the box is unchecked, that means JavaScript has been disabled. Simply check or uncheck said box in order to adjust your preferences. Then close the "Preferences" window, and your preference will automatically take effect.

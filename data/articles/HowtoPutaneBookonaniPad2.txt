 Another way to download books on your iPad is to go through iTunes. Tap on the iTunes app, and look for the search bar in the upper right side corner of your screen.
 In the search bar, type in the title or author of your book (depending on your search preferences). Once you've entered your search criteria, you'll see different categories at the top of your screen. One of the categories will be Books. Tap on it to display books only.
 Once you've located your book, tap on the small rectangle next to the book. It'll either read GET or it'll say the price of the book. Confirm your iTunes password, then tap OK.
 In order to view your book, you'll have to launch iBooks. Go to the iBooks app on your iPad, then tap on it to display your book. A list of your downloaded books will appear. Choose the book you want to read, tap on it, and begin reading.
 If you can't find the app on your iPad, you'll have to download it through the App Store. To do so, simply tap on the App Store application. Then, enter iBooks in the search bar. Once the results come up, tap on the GET button next to the app.


If the iBooks app is already on your tablet, but you weren't able to locate it, the App Store will tell you.
If you already have the iBooks app, you'll see only one option: to Open iBooks. Tap on it to launch iBooks.

 Playfully calling your wife by something other than her name is nice because is both affectionate and annoying. You can choose a name that reflects one of your wife’s characteristics (“Pancake Snatcher,” if she always steals your breakfast), or one that is just plain silly (“Pudding Toes”). Just make sure that the nickname doesn’t poke at a flaw or something else she is sensitive about., Children love to play the game where they repeat back everything that someone says. This is also a great technique to pull out when trying to get on your wife’s nerves in a lighthearted way. Try a dialogue like this (just don’t let it go on too long!)Her: “So what are we going to do tomorrow?”
You: “So what are we going to do tomorrow?”
Her: “That’s what I just asked!”
You: “That’s what I just asked!”
Her: “Why are you repeating everything I say?”
You: “Why are you repeating everything I say?”
Her: “Would you just stop?!”
You: “Would you just stop?!”
Her: “I mean it!”
You: “Ok.”

, A variation of mimicking someone is to repeat what they say in a slightly different or exaggerated way. For instance, if your wife says something like “I just can’t find shoes to match this dress,” try repeating it back in an over-the-top imitation of her voice. You can also exaggerate what she says a bit, by saying something like “Oh, I just can’t find the right shoes! Life is so hard! What am I going to do?”, When your wife does something silly or harmlessly embarrassing, you can playfully annoy her by saying something about it. For instance, if she accidentally spills salad dressing all over her shirt, you could say something like “Hey, uh, I think you got a little something there on your shirt. It’s just right there. That little spot.”You may not want to try this technique when out in public, since it might really embarrass your wife. Instead, focus on helping her.
 When having a conversation with your wife, start disagreeing with her about something that she obviously knows you don’t actually disagree with her about. This will be sure to annoy her, but since it is something obvious, she will know that you are kidding. For example, if you saw a cat:You: “Do you see that dog over there?”
Her: “It’s a cat!”
You: “No, it’s a dog.”
Her: “It’s not a dog! It’s a cat!”
You: “Oh wait, actually I think it’s a raccoon.”
Her: “It’s a cat!”

, When talking with your wife, try saying a few words the wrong way, such as “ahh-may-zing” for “amazing,” or by saying things like “That’s totes fabs” instead of “That’s totally fabulous,” or just “That’s great.” She’ll find this annoying, and a little embarrassing if you try it around other people. You can also turn this into a running gag if you consistently pronounce a certain word the wrong way., An easy way to have a little light-hearted fun with your wife is to ask her questions that she knows you don’t really want an answer to, and that are just plain silly. Ask her the question with a very serious expression on your face. If she says you are being ridiculous, say something like “No, I really want to know!” Example questions include:“If ran for president, do you think he’d pick me as his vice president?”
"If the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus got in a fight, who do you think would win?"

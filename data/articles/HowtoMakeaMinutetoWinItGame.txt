 Plan it like the real show - 10 challenges with different values of money/points, or you can make it to collecting points. The games are randomly played, the player that completes a game will get points, the easier challenges are worth less points and the harder challenges are worth more points, and the player with the most points wins. Or you can make your own plan. It's your game!;
, You need to find the Minute to Win It games or your own games to play it. To find Minute to Win It games, click the NBC Minute to Win It website. You can also plan your own games. You can download the blueprints too.
 You will need materials to run a game. So read the games' instructions, search your materials, and collect it for the game.
 Get ready with the 60 seconds timer and your games' materials. Start the game after you are ready with your friends. If they completed the challenge before the 60 seconds elapse, then they passed, and if they failed, make them retry it.
 It doesn't have to be a big amount of money like the real game. So award them with chocolate, paper trophies, or something else. They'll surely be satisfied.

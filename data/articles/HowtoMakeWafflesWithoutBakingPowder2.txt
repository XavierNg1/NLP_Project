 Use a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add 1.5 cups of flour (188 g), 1 teaspoon of salt, and a ½ teaspoon of baking soda. Stir until they are evenly mixed., Start by beating one egg in a second medium-sized mixing bowl. Next, throw in a ½ cup of granulated sugar (101 g), 2 tablespoons of softened butter, and 2 tablespoons of shortening. Mix thoroughly with an electric mixer until the consistency becomes smooth. Then add a ½ cup of half & half (118 ml), a ½ cup of milk (118 ml), a ¼ cup of buttermilk (59 ml), and a ¼ teaspoon of vanilla. Continue mixing until they are combined.If you are making batter ahead of time, cover the bowl with its lid or plastic wrap and refrigerate.
 First, apply a light coat of vegetable oil over your waffle iron to prevent sticking. Then let the iron preheat to optimum temperature. Once it does, ladle about ⅓ to ½ cup of batter (78 to 118 ml) onto the iron. Close the iron and cook for three to four minutes.Waffle irons’ temperatures may vary. Adjust cooking time as needed.

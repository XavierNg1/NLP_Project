 A good scavenger hunt is to have a whole lot of things to look for at a shop. But, it requires no money. so like simple things like a piece of paper, business card, paper towels (at a food court or something) a loose button etc. Also ones to do at night are: Glow in the dark scavenger hunt. (best to do it when parents are asleep) scatter glow in the dark items around the house and within a 5 minute time limit you have to find as many as you can. The person with the most glow in the dark items wins.;

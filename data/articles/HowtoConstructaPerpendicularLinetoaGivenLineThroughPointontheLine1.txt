 Set the protractorâ€™s origin hole over the line's given point. Align the protractor so that its base line sits exactly over the given line.


The origin hole is the small hole at the bottom-center of the protractor.
The base line is the line on the bottom of the protractor marking 180/0 degrees.;
, This is the line measurement at the very top of the protractor. Two perpendicular lines form a 90-degree, or right, angle.Thus, to draw a perpendicular line, you need to draw a 90-degree angle.
 Use the straightedge of the protractor to ensure that the line is straight. This line is perpendicular to the original line, through the given point on the line.

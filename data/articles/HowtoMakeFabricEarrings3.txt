 Your kit needs to include a button cover tool, or you won't be able to put the buttons together. You can choose any size kit you want.
 Use a pair of scissors to cut the template out, then a pen or pencil to trace it onto your fabric. You will need one circle per button.


Some kits come with a plastic template inside the package. If your kit is one of those, use that instead.
 Don't worry if the edges aren't perfectly evenâ€”they will be tucked inside the button.
 Cover button kits come with two parts: a large, squishy part, and a small hard, plastic part. You are looking for the large, squishy part. Set the large, squishy part down, and place the fabric over it.
 Make sure that you are placing the button curved-side-down into the tool. The fabric may shift while you are doing this, so be careful. If the fabric shifts, you will need to adjust it. You want there to be equal amounts of fabric all around the button.
 Don't worry if the fabric crumples or looks bulky. You will likely need to hold the fabric in place with your finger.
 Some button cover kits come with two types of backs: a smooth back and a back with a shank on it. Choose the smooth back.


If your button kit only came with the shanked backings, use a pair of needle nose pliers to pull the shank out., Take the smaller, plastic part of your button maker. Press it on top of the button backing, making sure that the fabric is tucked under it. Push down hard on it. You should feel a slight "thump" as the button comes together.


If you don't feel the thump, try hitting the plastic part with a hammer or mallet.
 Place a large glob of glue on the front of a blank earring post, then press the post against the back of the button. Don't worry if some glue leaks out.
 Once the earrings are dry, they are ready to wear!

 Look around where you are. Are you sitting on it? Is it in the car? Did you go to the bathroom and someone pick it up to look for it? All of these are questions you should ask before you assume your PSP is missing.;
, Just because it's lost to you doesn't mean that someone else didn't see it! Maybe they can help you.
 Maybe you set it down in a restaurant and it's still there.
 Do everything you remember doing after the last time you saw it. Try to mimic the conversations. Every little bit helps.
 More often than not it will turn up somewhere the moment you stop actively looking for it.
 jacket? friends house? somewhere else? Also look in unusual places you wouldn't expect it to be.

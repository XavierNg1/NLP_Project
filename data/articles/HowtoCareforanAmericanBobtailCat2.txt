 This breed is very active, so it will benefit from short walks around the block. Use a cat leash and collar to walk them around the block. If you live in a rural area, you could also just let the cat outside to explore for periods of the day. However, if you like to let your cat outside, you should consider the impact of your cat on local wildlife, as well as risks such as traffic and predation.Try training your cat to walk on a leash as a kitten, since they are more open to new experiences at a young age. That said, you can train a cat to walk on a leash at any age., The American Bobtail cat is very smart. If you leave the cat inside during the day, you need to give it something to keep its mind occupied.Puzzle toys such as food mazes, prize games, treat ball games and massagers are all good options. Line toys are another great option, such as wands and teasers with furry animals on the end., If your Bobtail cat were in the wild, you might find them exercising their muscles on trees. In the comfort of your home, they may want to scratch your expensive furniture. Instead of your furniture, find a scratching toy that your cat will enjoy. Consider the height, material, surfaces and sturdiness of the scratching toy.


Scratching posts, for instance, should have a very sturdy base, a variety of surfaces to scratch and be made from sisal fabric or another attractive material. The sturdiness of the post is especially important, since you donâ€™t want your cat to get injured climbing a poorly made post.

 There are several readily available products that have been found to improve psoriasis symptoms.


Coal Tar. This is one of the oldest treatments for psoriasis, and can help reduce itching, swelling, and scaling of skin. It is found in a variety of over-the-counter creams and shampoos. Be aware that coal tar can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, meaning you will burn more easily. Make sure there is none on your skin before sunbathing.
Salicylic Acid. This works as a peeling agent that softens and loosens scaly skin. Like coal tar, it is found in many OTC topical products.
Aloe Vera. This can help reduce the irritation and itching associated with psoriasis.
 These don't prevent or alleviate the scaly skin caused by psoriasis, but can fight uncomfortable itching.

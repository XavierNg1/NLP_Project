 If your cat has a tendency to lick or wipe off medication, try applying the treatment immediately before feeding time. Feeding your cat directly after applying the medication may help keep it distracted long enough for the treatment to dry or be absorbed., If your cat is prone to licking or biting at its injury, use an Elizabethan collar, or cone, to help keep your cat's mouth from coming into contact with the afflicted area. You may opt to use the collar while the medication dries, or keep it on the cat until the injury being treated heals completely.Elizabethan collars may be supplied by your vet, or can be purchased at most pet stores.
 Bandages or other dressing should be changed regularly to keep the treated area clean, and to avoid snagging or becoming loose. Redress the area each time you apply medication. If medication is applied less than once a day, be sure to check on the bandage daily to make sure it hasnâ€™t come loose.Bandages should not be too loose or too tight. You should just be able to slide two fingers under the bandage.
Bandages should generally be changed every two or so days regardless of how loose they are.

 Take out the big roasting pan, and wash all fresh whole vegetables (unpeeled.) Make a layer of whole vegetables on the bottom of the pan, including whole carrots and celery stalks. Add some fresh herb, sprinkle dried herbs, or use a combination. ;
,  Sprinkle the sea salt and/or soy sauce, and black pepper all over the meat. Do not over salt.
  Put all other whole vegetables (unpeeled) uncut around the roast, including whole potatoes, and whole little squashes. Cover roast with a layer of bacon slices.  Pour half to one bottle cheap wine and bottle into the pan.
 Cook on high for one hour.
 Turn the oven down to medium-low for another hour.
  Cook another half to one hour on low. Check doneness and turn oven off when meat is thoroughly cooked and tender.
 Chill the wines, beer and other drinks. Set separate bowls or plates for salad or bread, and put out salt and pepper shakers.
  If you have a decent looking roasting pan, you can take that to the table to serve. Prior to serving, you can skim the fat off the top of the juices if you want to. The bacon can be discarded if it is too blackened, or eaten if it is not blackened. 

,  The fresh bread and salad complement well. Serve the dessert and coffee/tea after.

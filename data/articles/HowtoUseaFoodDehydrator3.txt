, Most recipes have a high salt content combined with combination black pepper, brown sugar and sauces.
 Spread the marinade generously, on all surfaces of the meat. Store in a covered glass dish for 12 hours.
 Dry for 4 hours at 140 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit (60 to 70 degrees Celsius). Check jerky. Dry for the remainder of the time at 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius). Jerky is done when it cracks, not breaks, when you bend it.


Jerky will last between 1 and 2 months, but can be frozen to last longer.

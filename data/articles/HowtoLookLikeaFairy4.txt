 True fairies fly with the delicate, gossamer wings that grow on their upper back.


You can buy fairy wings at costume shops and online.
Look for larger wings made of a sheer fabric thatâ€™s light in color (white, cream, soft pink or blue).
If the wings are plain, consider decorating them with glitter, flowers and beads.
 Some fairies wear jeweled crowns, other prefer crowns made of flowers or leaves. If you opt for a jeweled crown, remember to choose one that has an old-fashioned, antique look.
 Feel free to paint flowers, butterflies and other romantic and natural designs on your face.

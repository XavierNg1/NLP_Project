 (i.e. Learn the scene);
, Nothing looks worse than an unprepared actor for an audition. If you want a lead role the director wants to know they can trust you to be prepared.
 It could be your friends or parents or just anyone who will lend their ear.
 Notes are advice to improve! Take them! The more developed your scene is the better!

, Before performances and other big acting events, a good way to get rid of being nervous is to shake! Many actors do this to get rid of jitters.
 Try to use your face as much as possible. In a lot of auditions you can't move around so the face is a great way to show emotion.
 The director needs to know you can say something loudly, so when the show comes, everyone can hear you, even the people in the back row!

, Do your best and show confidence!

,


Tongue twisters, like "She sells sea shells by the seashore" and do this until you get it perfect, saying it loudly and clearly.
Do some scales.
Breathe. Breathe in, (without your shoulders going up), and sing/talk.
Bring some water. If you've already warmed up though, don't drink.

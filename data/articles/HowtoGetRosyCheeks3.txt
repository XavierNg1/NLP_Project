 A cheek massage is healthy for your face, since it helps your skin circulation. Apply a light face oil so your fingers will glide easily across your skin instead of dragging it down (which can lead to sagging and wrinkles). Any of the following are great for your skin:


Olive oil
Almond oil
Jojoba oil
Your favorite face moisturizer

, Using the tips of your fingers, massage the sides of your face with a large circular motion. Your fingers should move up toward your inner cheekbones, out over your cheekbones, down past the apples of your cheeks, and back around. Repeat for one minute to increase circulation in your cheek area.Massaging your cheeks will draw blood to the area, giving you a nice rosy glow.
As a bonus, facial massage is great for your skin; it helps prevent sagging and wrinkles.
 Now that your blood is moving, pinch your cheeks where you want them to look most colorful. Use the sides of your forefingers and your thumbs to pinch. Do a pattern of light, small pinches where you want a rosy hue to appear.


Don't pinch too hard or pull on your skin. You don't want to damage your skin or hurt yourself.
The effects should last ten to fifteen minutes.
 It's a good trick to have up your sleeve before you're about to go on a date, or when you just want to show up to an event looking fresh and healthy. This method only works when your makeup is minimal, since your natural color won't show through heavy foundation.

 Bubble bars are luxurious, so you wouldn't want to waste them on a quick, five minute bath, Make sure you have about 20 minutes to spare so that you can enjoy them.
 These bars are relatively new, so not every place may have them. They are harder than regular bubble bars, and don't crumble as easily. They usually come on a string or stick, and can be reused up to 10 times., Use a temperature that is most comfortable for you. Have your bubble bar ready and a towel handy. You will need to set your bubble bar on the towel so that it can dry.
 These bars don't need to be held under running water. When the tub as full as you like it, turn the water off and stick the bar under the water. Swish it around until bubbles form. You won't need to use the entire bar.
 If you store the bar in its bag or box while it is still wet, you'll trap the moisture, and the bar will melt away.
 Light some candles, turn on some music, or read a book. These bubbles will last for about 20 minutes, so take your time in the bath.

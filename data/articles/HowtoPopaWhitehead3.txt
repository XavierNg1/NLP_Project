 If possible, do this with a textured exfoliating finger mitt that you can buy in your local drug store or department store. After washing your hands and face, use a chemical exfoliant with salicylic acid. Gently rub across the surface of the pimple in short horizontal strokes., Fill a saucepan about half-way full with water. Bring the water to a boil. Remove it from the burner and let it cool down for a few minutes. Place a body towel over your head and hold it out with your hands to make it form somewhat of a tent. Lower your face toward the saucepan enough to feel the steam. Allow the steam to hit your face for about five minutes.This step is easiest if the whitehead is on your face or neck. If you try it with a whitehead on your back or shoulders, it's really awkward.
 After you wrap your index fingers in tissue, place them on either side of the whitehead. Pull gently outward. At this point, it might begin to pop. If it does, you'll have less squeezing to do. Simply wipe away what comes out. Replace the tissue to avoid spreading germs., Place each of your index fingers on either side of the whitehead. Press down and in very slowly to avoid damaging your skin. Wipe away the pus that comes out. Continue to squeeze until the pus is completely drained.Blood and/or clear liquid is a cue to stop, regardless of whether or not you can drain all the pus.

 One of the best features of Shazam is their app, which allows you to identify songs played on the radio (or through anything else that plays music) to help you discover new music. The app is available for Apple or Android phones and can also be connected to your apple or google watch.
 To use the Shazam app, anytime you hear a new song that you are interested in, open up the Shazam app and press "Touch to Shazam." Shazam will then listen to the song and identify it. Then, you'll have the option to purchase the song, or be directed to a page where Shazam shows the lyrics to the song, allows you to start a station with the song, and recommends other songs similar to the song.
 On the home page of the app, you can explore top tracks from around the world and see what artists have Shazamed recently, which may help you discover new music. You can also see trending Shazams and will have the opportunity to follow the artist, watch the music video, listen to other recommended songs, or listen to the song for free on the "Rdio" function of the app.To see trending Shazams you can also visit the "Trending" page and you will have access to the top trending tracks in a number of different genres. You can also see what was just Shazamed on the app by other users.
 On the "My Shazam" page of your app, you can see all of the songs you have Shazamed, but you can also log in or create an account for more features. By creating an account you can connect to Spotify and Rdio and have access to all of the artists you are following.You can do all of these same features on the Shazam website as well, but the app may functionally be easier if you are trying to discover new music on your phone.

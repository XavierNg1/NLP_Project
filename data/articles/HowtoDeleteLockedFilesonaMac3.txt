 “Go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal” to open. The terminal allows you to execute commands to the operating system with code. The “sudo” tag is used to grant root access. After entering a command with it, you may be prompted for your account’s administrator password to proceed with the command.
 Enter “sudo chflags nouchg ”. This should force toggle the files locked status.


For example: “sudo chflags nouchg ~/Applications/Microsoft Word/test.doc”.
You can also drag and drop the target file in the terminal window to automatically enter the file path.
 If all else fails, another terminal command can force file deletion. Enter “sudo rm -r ”. In most cases, this command will delete the file once granted administrator permission with the password.

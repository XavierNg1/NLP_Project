 If you have a SpeedUp smartwatch, you should download the SpeedUp Smartwatch app from Google Play for free.
 Open your device Settings, tap “Wireless and Networks” and then “Bluetooth.” Slide the toggle switch ON to enable Bluetooth.
 Do this by tapping on “Make device discoverable” and on “OK” from the same Bluetooth screen.
 Once open, make sure that the “SpeedUp Smart Watch Bluetooth” is enabled on the screen.
 Tap the “Search Smart watch” option on the bottom of the screen. Make sure that your smartwatch is turned on so your Android device can detect it.
 A new screen will pop up with the name of all the devices with Bluetooth within range. Tap the smartwatch Bluetooth name, and tap “Bond.”


When the pairing message appears, tap the checkmark on the smartwatch and tap “Pair” on the phone. If pairing both device is successful, tap the “Send notification” option that will be displayed on the smartphone. If your phone vibrates, it means the synchronization is successful.



Tap “Activate Notification Service,” and on the new screen, select “Accessibility” and then tap on “Just once.”
Tap “SpeedUp Smartwatch,” which is initially turned off, to enable it. A new message will appear asking “Use Smart watch?” Tap “OK.” You will now get notifications on your smartwatch.

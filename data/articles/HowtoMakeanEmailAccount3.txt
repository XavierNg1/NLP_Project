 Note that many email accounts nowadays save your contacts automatically when you send email to or receive email from a person or institution.


To bring up contacts, find the contacts tab or simply type in the first or last name of the person you want to email, or the beginning of their email address. Their email address and contact information should automatically pop up.

This often means you don't have to "save" someone as a contact in order to send them an email.
 Navigate to your Contacts tab, and find the import button; then follow any directions that follow. Usually it's as easy as dragging and dropping a .CSV file into your browser window.

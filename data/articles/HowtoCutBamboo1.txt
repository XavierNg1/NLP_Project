 If you are using bamboo for a project, you should generally choose green wood because it’s easier to use. If it’s cold outside, you will want to heat the bamboo stalks so they won’t split.


Put masking tape where you are going to cut. It can stop the wood from splintering. Use a sharp pruner to cut bamboo that is less than 1-inch in diameter. If it’s more than that, you should use a sharp handsaw. Pick one with straight teeth or it will tear the plant’s fibers.
Use your measuring tape, or formal project plans, to determine how wide a piece of bamboo you need. Find bamboo of approximately that thickness, understanding that bamboo does not come in uniform diameters.;
, Most people use or cut the stem of the bamboo plant because this is the part that grows above ground. It usually grows straight.The stems contain nodes that strengthen it. That’s the purpose they serve to the plant. The number of nodes may differ, depending on the type of bamboo. You can find nodes by looking for areas that have two rings positioned closely together. The lower ring of the node is called the sheath ring, and the upper one is called the stem ring.
Most bamboo is hollow inside. The thickness of the wall differs depending on the species of bamboo. One bamboo species is almost solid., It must be cut an angle of 45 degrees between the nodes.


Make sure to work in a room temperature environment with room temperature tools to again prevent splitting.
Mineral oil is often used to lubricate bamboo.

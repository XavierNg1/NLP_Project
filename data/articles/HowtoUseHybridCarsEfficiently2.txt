 If your battery is fully charged, it will more quickly wear out. Similarly, if your battery is totally or nearly depleted, it will have an adverse affect on the total number of charges you’ll be able to get out of it.Keep an eye on your battery’s gauge. When you’ve charged it to an upper mid-range value, around 80%, end the recharging process. Don’t let the battery’s power drop beyond 20%.


Some hybrid manufacturers have factored this fact into their design, and have safeguards in place from preventing a battery from actually reaching a totally full or totally empty state. Consult your user manual for specifics about how to manage your battery’s charge levels.
 Keeping your battery warm really means keeping your car warm. If a battery gets cold, the amount of energy you can get out of it decreases.During winter, keep your hybrid in the garage to spare it from the worst of the cold weather.


Turn on your car and let it sit idle for a bit in order to get the battery warmed.
Excessive heat can be bad for your battery, too. A battery at ninety-two degrees Fahrenheit will only last five years. Keep your car in the garage and out of direct sunlight.
 Your hybrid might offer the option of choosing when to switch from the battery to the gasoline engine. When possible, use the battery, since you will save money on gasoline. In some cases, such as highway driving, hybrids will generally switch over to the gasoline engine automatically.


Drive within your vehicle’s battery range. Most hybrids allow between 10 and 35 miles of driving exclusively on the electric battery before they need to transition to a gasoline engine.Keep your drives short and at a close distance from your home. Stay close to home with your hybrid to maximize its efficiency.

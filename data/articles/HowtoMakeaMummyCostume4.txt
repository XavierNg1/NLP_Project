 The freakier you want to be, the more your face should be covered. If you're going for the cute, innocuous, smiling kind of mummy, just wrap from your chin, over your head, and a bit on your forehead. If your aim is to scare all the neighbors, only leave space to see and breathe.


Rope a friend into doing this part for you. You'll be able to get it on, but tying it securely will prove a task, especially if you have limited vision.
If you have a ski mask and want your entire face covered, you can use it as a base for your head wrap.
A safety pin, bobby pin, or other securing device may prove useful. Just tuck it into a different layer to keep it from being exposed.
 You want sunken eyes and hollow cheeks. A bit of white as a base and black around your cheekbones and under your eyes will give you a more ghastly feel. Add some baby powder on your body for the ancient mummy effect and you're ready!


Use gel around a stain or on your face to make your mummy globby and rotting-looking. Pull some hair out from a place or two and mess it up to look truly nightmarish., Or sit on your porch as the kiddies come up, be very still, and jump at them when they're least expecting it! Ha HA!

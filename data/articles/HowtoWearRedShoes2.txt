 If black, brown, gray, nude, white, and deep navy blue are the only colors found in your outfit, a neutral shoe will only make your outfit seem duller. Adding a bright red shoe can make your style pop. Try wearing a red pump the next time you throw on a black pencil skirt and white button-down blouse.
 Color blocking is the practice of wearing solid blocks of bright, complementary colors against one another. Try wearing your red shoes against an orange or pink dress.
 If you have a solid red dress, do not wear it with your red shoes. If you do, you run the risk of overkill. If you would prefer to wear your bright red shoes with a red dress, choose a deep red dress to add depth to your ensemble.
 Red and green are too closely associated with Christmas, and wearing them together will make your outfit look too seasonal. Instead of a bright green, mix your red shoes with deeper shades like olive.
 Red peep-toe shoes make a good accompaniment to a black and white polka dot dress or pinstripe trousers.
 While solid red outfits are often overkill with red shoes, a print with traces of red in it coordinates with your shoes in a subtle, appropriate manner.
 Red shoes look great against denim blue jeans, especially medium and dark washes. A red pump is an easy way to add a pop of color and a twist of sophistication to your everyday style.
 Red shoes are already relatively sexy. Wearing them with ripped jeans, tube tops, cut-off shorts, and other revealing garments does not make you look sexier. Instead of looking confident, it may simply look like you are trying too hard to be noticed.
 If you want to take full advantage of the seductive nature of red stilettos, pair them with an outfit that is subtly, rather than overtly, sultry. For instance, a little black dress with cap sleeves and a hemline that comes down to your knee can be very sexy, even though it shows a modest amount of skin. This makes it a potential candidate for your red high heels.
 You can match your red shoes with red lipstick and a red handbag, but stop there. Do not add a red belt, red scarf, red bracelet, and ruby red ring to the mix. A few red accessories looks coordinated, but too many looks overdone.

 If your raincoat only has a small spill or area that needs cleaning, there’s probably no need to subject it to the rigors of a machine wash. Mix a bit of mild liquid dish soap into some warm water until it is sudsy. Dip a clean sponge into the water. Gently wipe away at the spot you’re interested in cleaning.Avoid using soaps containing perfumes, enzymes, or surfactants., Fill your tub or large sink with a shallow layer of hot water. Mix in mild soap flakes until the water is sudsy. Dunk the raincoat in the water. Take it out and place it on a clean, flat surface. Gently scrub the whole coat using a soft sponge or scrubbing brush.Start by scrubbing the outside of the coat, then move on to the inside.
Dip your sponge or brush back into the soapy water regularly to prevent it from drying out.
Drain the water after you’re done cleaning the raincoat. Place the raincoat in the sink or tub and rinse it off with cool water from the faucet or showerhead.
 If the instructions provided by the care label seem onerous, or if you suspect that you are unequal to the task of cleaning it, you could choose to take the raincoat to a dry cleaners. If your raincoat has challenging care instructions, your dry cleaner may ask you to sign a waiver conceding that you will not hold them responsible for any damage that might occur in cleaning it.If your raincoat contains polyurethane, do not take it to the dry cleaner. Polyurethane might be listed on the manufacturer’s label as “PU” or “PVC.” Coats containing this material will crack and flake off when subjected to dry cleaning.

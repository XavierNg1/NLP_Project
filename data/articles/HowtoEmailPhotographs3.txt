 If you want to attach a photo to an email you send through Gmail, Yahoo, or any other web mail service, it will need to be uploaded from your computer. This means you will need to copy it to your computer first if it's on another device.

There are exceptions to this. You can attach files in Gmail from your Google Drive, which can be up to 10 GB. Outlook.com and OneDrive operate similarly.
 If you are emailing images you took with your digital camera, they may be way too big to send. You will need to resize these images and convert them to a format that is suitable for sharing, such as PNG or JPG.


File formats like BMP and RAW are much too large to send, and can cause inconveniences for your recipients.
If your recipient is planning on printing the images, send them without resizing.
 Login into your email service and create a new message.
 While the process varies depending on your service, you can usually click the "Attachments" button and browse your computer for the images you want to add. You may also be able to drag and drop images into the mail message.


The "Attachments" button typically looks like a paperclip.
The images will need to upload before you can proceed. This may take a little while if you are adding a lot of images on a slow connection.
 Once your message is complete and all the images added, click the Send button to send your message.

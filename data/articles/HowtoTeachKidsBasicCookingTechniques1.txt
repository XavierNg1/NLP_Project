 Use simple, direct statements to hammer home the dangers found in the kitchen. And, right from the start, make it clear what they can help with and what tasks and tools are strictly off-limits:"Fire burns. It can cook the chicken, but it can also hurt your hand very badly.”
"Steam means the water is very hot. It cooks our noodles, but it can also burn your skin.”
"Knives are sharp. They cut our vegetables, but can also cut your finger and make it bleed.”
"You can help put the cookies on the cooled trays, but only I can put them in the oven or take them out.”;
, Before permitting a child with basic kitchen experience to take on more responsibilities, make sure to reiterate the essential safety rules and expand them to cover more specific tasks, tools, and techniques. Lay out rules such as keeping pot handles facing toward the back of the stovetop; using oven mitts anytime hot cookware is handled; and tying back loose hair or clothing near open flames., While most kids will be happy to stand on a chair and work at the kitchen counter with you, it’s safer to bring the work down closer to their level. If possible, try to work at a lower, kid-friendly table (you can sit down if that’s easier for you). Look for kid-sized kitchen tools as well.A kid-friendly workspace and tools can also help a child feel more engaged and eager to learn.
 Cooking skills, just like any other skills, will develop at different paces for different kids. One eight-year-old might be chopping cucumbers, while another is better left to mixing up the salad dressing.While a child’s eagerness shouldn’t override your judgement regarding their skill level and cooking experience, a kid who is itching to try out a new cooking technique is more likely ready to give it a go.
Use the inverse as a guide as well: if a child is hesitant to try using a chopping knife or the stovetop, it may be best to hold back for the time being.

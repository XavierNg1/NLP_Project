 Take it to a creature like Abyssal Demons with over 100 hitpoints, then use the nitroglycerin. When you are at about 30-40 health do the following in very quick succession:


Activate Protect From Melee and Piety.
Drink a dose of Super-Strength potion.
Equip your salve amulet (e), and attack. Over 1000 have been hit on these creatures using Dharoks.;
, Chances are, you'll hit high. If you fail, try again.
 Use prayer, potions and the special attack with decent strength-boosting equipment and you can max 830 outside of Castle Wars!

, Special with that using prayer and potions.

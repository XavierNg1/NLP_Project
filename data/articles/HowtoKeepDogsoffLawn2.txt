 The first step to keeping dogs of your lawn is to convince the dogs’ owners to cooperate. Make friends with your neighbors. Express concern about your lawn without accusing them or their dog of being at fault. Ideally they will begin to police their dog better if they know it might be a problem., If friendly cooperation is unlikely and you don’t mind being a bit dishonest, tell your neighbors that you have had your lawn chemically treated to repel raccoons or skunks and that it could be dangerous for dogs.There are a number of reasons why this is generally a less than optimal solution. It could illicit a negative reaction and lying will compromise your ability to appeal to authorities later in the process.
 If you know whose dog is responsible, consider contacting the owner. Be casual; invite him over for dinner or a drink. Instead of accusing him, assume that he is unaware of the situation and just needs to be informed of it. If the owner agrees to do something about it, drop the subject. Continuing to complain will likely aggravate him and jeopardize any agreement you might have reached.If you cannot reach an agreement, send a formal written complaint. Keep a copy for yourself so that you can prove to the authorities that you made an effort to resolve the issue., Look up local ordinances to see if they require dog owners to clean up after their pets; in most cases they will.Take a picture of the dog urinating or defecating on your lawn and call Animal Control to report the infraction.


In most cases city ordinances will be posted on the city’s website. Look up your city’s website to see what the law says about the situation.Alternatively, you can install a security camera to prove that the dog is invading your lawn. This can also be useful if your neighbor becomes aggressive and you want to prove his poor behavior to the authorities.

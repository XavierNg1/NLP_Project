 HTTrack is a free, open-source website copier that allows you to save every page and piece of media from an entire website while preserving links and building directories for all fo the content. Opening the page when offline will allow you to follow all of the links on the site, as long as they originally led to content on the same server.


You can download HTTrack for free from httrack.com. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
 HTTrack stores each site you archive as a "project". This allows you to easily select sites you've already archived to update.
 HTTrack recommends that you create a base directory for all of your saved websites, and then name each site. HTTrack will build discrete directories for each of your projects in the base directory.
 If you want to archive an entire website, make sure you start with the website's base address.
 You will see progress bars as HTTrack begins to download all of the content from the website. This can take a significant amount of time, especially for larger sites and slower connections.


By default, HTTrack will follow every link on the website and download the content that it finds, but it will only stay on the website that you set. This keeps HTTrack from downloading the entire internet to your computer.
 Once the archival process is complete, you can open the directory that you set for the project and load the .html file for the website. You'll be able to navigate through all of the pages, even if you're offline.


If the site had streaming video, you won't be able to view it unless you have an internet connection.

 A vegetarian diet can produce many positive results during pregnancy. Eating protein sources that are strictly vegetarian can be much easier on your kidneys than other protein sources. Many women also find that a vegetarian diet helps to ease tooth decay during pregnancy, which is a very common problem that pregnant women experience. A vegetarian diet will also lower your risk of hypertension, gestational diabetes and obesity.
 One of the main cons of a vegetarian diet during pregnancy is the extra effort it will take to make sure that you are getting all of the vitamins and minerals that your body needs in order to ensure that your baby is developing at a healthy rate. You will have to be vigilant about planning each of your meals effectively and obtaining all of the nutrients that your body needs in your meals. It is also important to make sure that you are using the correct supplements in order to obtain any nutrients that are not contained in the vegetarian foods you are eating.

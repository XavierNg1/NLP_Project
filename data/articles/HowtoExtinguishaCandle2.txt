 Some people dislike the sooty mess that blowing out a candle can leave behind. For these people, a metal candle snuffer can provide a cleaner, more efficient alternative. These make useful tools to have on hand if you want to keep your candles looking clean and new for as long as possible.Snuffers have been used for centuries to extinguish fire lights with minimal smoke.Candle snuffers of various sizes can usually be found wherever candles are sold.
 The bell is the small metal cup at the end of the long handle. When you lower the bell over the flame, it deprives it of oxygen, stifling it gradually. Unlike blowing out the candle, this won’t create as much smoke or soot.Some candle snuffers may resemble a cylinder, pyramid or disc instead of a rounded bell.
Keep your hand a safe distance away from the flame to prevent accidents.
 You may see a small wisp of smoke escape from around the edges of the bell. Keep it over the wick for at least one full second. Afterward, cover the candle with a lid and store the snuffer in a safe, out-of-the-way place.If you don’t hold the snuffer long enough, the flame may reignite, forcing you to try a second time.
Be careful handling metal snuffers while they’re still hot.

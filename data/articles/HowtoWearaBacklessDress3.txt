 Hold your head high, your shoulders back, and your chest out. Straight posture will make your back look its best, but a bent, hunched over back looks significantly less attractive.
 Accessories are an important part of any outfit, but the primary purpose of a backless dress is to show off your back. Too many accessories can draw attention away. Opt for a simple yet elegant pair of dangling earrings or a delicate bracelet to add just a touch of sparkle to your look.
 Scarves are the biggest culprits. Necklaces can also create a disruption by drawing the eye to the necklace clasp instead of your back. Necklaces with an adjustable chain that hangs down the top of your back are especially bad choices.
 You may have long, luxurious locks, but if they cover your entire back, there is not much point in wearing a backless dress. Wear your hair up for the evening to fully show off your back.
 For a more demure look, keep your hair partially down. Allow part of it drape down your back, but make sure that enough of your skin still shows through. Playing coy can actually heighten the attractiveness of a backless dress.

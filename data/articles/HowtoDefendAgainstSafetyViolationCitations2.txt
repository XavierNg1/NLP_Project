 You cannot claim it was infeasible or impossible for you to comply with the regulation unless you know the regulation and the harm it is supposed to prevent.


You must demonstrate that you have recognized and evaluated the particular hazard associated with the standard you've been cited with violating., Any evidence of efforts your business made to comply with the standard or regulation supports your argument that compliance wasn't feasible.


It isn't enough to try only once â€“ typically you must show that you made multiple attempts to comply with the standard and all were unsuccessful.Attempts to comply also must be ongoing. Generally you must demonstrate to OSHA that your employees' safety is paramount and that you have diligently attempted to comply with the rule and found it impossible to do so and still complete the particular work or project., A hardship typically means that the job cannot be completed otherwise. OSHA does not consider any amount financial hardship to your company to justify non-compliance with safety standards.However, keep in mind that it's not enough simply to say that compliance with the OSHA standard would be expensive, or would require you to change your methods of production., Even if the particular standard proved impossible to implement, it helps your case to show other efforts you made to fulfill the same purpose.Because you essentially must argue that whatever work must be completed cannot be done at all if you complied with OSHA's safety standard, this defense is exceedingly difficult to prove.OSHA agents test standards in many contexts before regulations are issued, and to prove compliance is impossible for your company may require you to distinguish your work from that being done in similar businesses that have managed to comply with the standard.
Additionally, rapid advances in technology require that your search for reasonable alternatives be continual.Spending a few months searching for an alternative and not finding one won't get you off the hook a year later.

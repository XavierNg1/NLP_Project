 You can make a moisturizing mask with ingredients you probably have in your kitchen. Check your cabinets or go to the grocery store to get the following supplies:


Honey, which has natural antibacterial and moisturizing properties.
Olive oil or almond oil, each of which leave your skin smooth and supple.
Apple cider vinegar, a natural toner that can also be used to condition your hair.
 Place a tablespoon of honey, a tablespoon of olive oil and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a bowl. Use a spoon or whisk to stir the mixture until it is completely combined.









Store extra moisturizing mask in a jar with a tight-fitting lid, and keep it in the refrigerator until you want to use it again.
Add a teaspoon of plain yogurt or oatmeal for an even softer result.
 Starting with a clean face, rub the mask liberally over your skin. Make sure to apply plenty to areas that are the driest, like your forehead and the bridge of your nose. Let the mask dry for 15 minutes.
 Use cool water to remove the mask and tone your skin. There's no need to moisturize afterward; your skin should be soft and fresh.

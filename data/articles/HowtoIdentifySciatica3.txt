 Your doctor will have you describe all your symptoms.


He or she will then analyze them, and use your medical profile, lifestyle, and family history to form a diagnosis.
They will ask specific questions about what kind of jobs/sport you participate in, or any other activities that may irritate your sciatica.
Your doctor might also ask if you have any problems controlling your bladder or bowel movements, if you have experienced excessive numbness or weakness in your leg or thigh, or if you suffer from frequent urinary tract infections.
 In addition to the background diagnostics, your doctor will use a physical examination to identify pain locations and to determine the main causes of your sciatica.


This will primarily focus on whether the sciatica originates from the spine or not.
 This test can determine if you are suffering from a case of sciatica.


You will lay down on a bed, on your back with both legs straight.
You will be asked to raise the affected leg at a 45 degree angle, while keeping it straight.
Then, the doctor will test the reflexes of your foot.
If your feel any pain at your lower back or thigh, you are probably suffering from sciatica.
 Your doctor may use other tests to determine your condition. These tests include:


Blood tests to determine whether or not you are suffering from infection
X-ray or CT scans that can pick up any spinal deformities or herniated discs
MRIs to gain a more detailed picture of the condition of your nerves and bones

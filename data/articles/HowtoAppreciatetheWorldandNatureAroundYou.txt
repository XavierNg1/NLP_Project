 Walk under blossom trees and feel the pink blooms fall on to your shoulders. Pick one up and see how pretty it is, like a flash of color on a dull, grey pavement. Listen to birds singing in tune, all together, like a choir of animals. What do you think they're singing about? A cat prowling around under their branch, or are they simply alerting the world that morning has broken?;
, Like snails, for instance. Usually you'd just think "Ew!" and walk on by, but really their shells are fascinating. The gentle swirls and spirals on brown or green shells... almost as though somebody has got a paintbrush and painted it on.
 They are truly wonderful plants, with a green stem to suck up water and anchor it in to the ground, pollen for other creatures, an ovary, stigma and stamen for reproduction, lovely colorful petals to attract insects - along with a filament, style and an ovule!

, That's truly beautiful in itself. Sometimes a bright, clear blue, sometimes grey with a few fluffy white clouds, and occasionally a dark, smeary black. Above all, up above it is the entire universe.
 Seas, rivers, ponds, oceans... even just water running from your tap or down your window is pretty. When the light catches a raindrop, it reflects different colors.
 The multi-color arches never last for long, but are stunning if you think about it.
 People's eye colors are different, their skin tones, hair colors, nose and lip and eye shapes, their ears, their bodies, their personalities, everybody is different. Cities have big, tall buildings and busy roads full of traffic and different cars, buses, vans, motorbikes and bikes.
 Even a gentle breeze is beautiful. The wind gently moves your hair about, like an imaginary hand.
 Soon, you'll begin to see that you should appreciate the world around you, because it is gorgeous.

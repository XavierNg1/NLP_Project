 When you blow into them, you should feel the air pushing them apart as pressure builds up. If it does not, the air is leaking somewhere.


Take a deep breath and then exhale slowly and evenly into your hands. It should take 10-12 seconds to run out of air.
 If your hands are too far apart you will hear a deep, low exhaling sound as you breathe, almost like Darth Vader’s breath. You should hear a thin, high-pitched “whoosh” of air even if you don’t hear a whistle, so move your thumbs closer together to improve your sound.
 While blowing, slowly rotate your hands up and down. Many people put their mouths right up against the hole. You need to have small space open under your bottom lip, and your upper lip should seal any holes between your thumbs.
 You can always change the note you are trying to whistle. It all depends on how hard you are blowing and how tightly the back of the hand-cave is closed. If your palms open some, you will get a higher-pitched sound than when they're tightly shut. The more you open, the higher the sound will be.


There are, of course, limits to this, as opening too much will prevent any whistling at all.

 While "félicitations" works in a wide variety of situations, you may want something more specific occasionally.[[Image:Say Congratulations in French Step 3.jpg}}


"Good work/job" → "Bon travail!"

"Great success/Good Luck" (used interchangeably) → "Bonne réuissite."Give my compliments to ____" → "Addressez tous mes compliments à ____"

, This is the same as saying "She congratulates you." Luckily, the translation is not too difficult. "Félicitations" means congratulations, and "féliciter" means "to congratulate." Remember that, in French, the subject of the person you congratulate must come before the verb, unlike in English. Thus:


"I want to congratulate you." → "Je veux vous féliciter."
"The President congratulates him." → "Le Président le félicite."
Add "pour" to make specific congratulations: "They congratulate you on the win" &rarr: "Ils vous félicitent pour le victoire.", Just like in English, you can use some slang terms to tell someone you're proud of them. This gives you variety, instead of always saying "félicitations."


"Bravo!" much like in English, expresses awe at a job well done.
"Chapeau," which translates to "hat" in English, is used in place of "hats off to you." It may, however, seem a little old-fashioned.

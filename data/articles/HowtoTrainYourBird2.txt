 Towel training your bird is useful if you need to groom him, administer medication, or handle him when he is injured. Bright-colored towels may be alarming to your bird, so lighter-colored towels are preferable.Place the towel on the bottom of his cage.
It may be helpful to first leave the towel in your bird’s cage for several days to allow him to get used to its presence.
 Similar to your hand, your bird may not be immediately comfortable with the towel. Place a treat on the towel to entice your bird to step on it., When your bird is standing on the towel, gently wrap him up in it from behind. It is very important that you wrap him up in such a way that he cannot bite you, but is still able to breathe comfortably. To begin, gently place your thumb and middle finger of the hand holding the towel on each side of his neck.Do not put any pressure on your bird’s neck with the thumb and middle finger.Place the index finger of the hand holding the towel on top his head to keep him still.Wrap your bird's wings inside the towel to prevent him from struggling and flapping his wings.Make sure that the towel is not rubbing your bird’s eyes.Do not put any pressure on his chest. Pressure on his chest could cause him to suffocate.Try to rest your bird in the palm of the hand holding the towel.You may need to use both hands if you have a larger bird.
 Ensure that your bird’s feet are touching the bottom of his cage. With him stabilized on a solid surface, gently release your fingers from the sides of his neck and release him from the towel. He will probably ruffle his feathers and might even vocalize when you release him.Allow your bird to relax and get comfortable again.Reward him with a treat if he was still and did not try to bite you when you held him in a towel.

 Directors often get stressed, especially in the final weeks of rehearsal or filming. They may give harsh criticism or overreact to late arrivals and minor mistakes. Try not to let this upset you.;
, Talking back to the director will just make the work more unpleasant, and (if you're a professional) may hurt your chances at future productions. Try to find a strategy to calm down: count to ten, take deep breaths, or tense and relax your fists.
 Make an effort to understand what the director is going for. Pay attention to her instructions, practice your performance, and demonstrate that you're invested in a high quality result. Staying on the director's good side should help you avoid unpleasant situations.
 A good director listens to the actors' input, but that doesn't mean you can give it anytime, or that he's obligated to agree. Choose a moment when he doesn't look busy, ideally after rehearsal is finished. Phrase your suggestion as a question, such as "do you think it would work better if..."?

, At the end of the day, the director gets to make the decisions. The strict directors have often put a lot of thought into the production. Follow their instructions and learn how to work within their specifications.
 If the director is behaving unprofessionally and truly making you miserable, take some time to consider what to do. If you are working professionally, it may be worth seeing this production through for the sake of your resume or networking. Your older contacts or acting coaches can help you decide whether it's worth sticking with the performance.

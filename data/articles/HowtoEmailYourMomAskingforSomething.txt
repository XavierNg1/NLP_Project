 Make sure they're not all "It's fun" and "All of my friends have it". Make some reasons like those, to make it believable, but also think of reasons your mom might approve of.;
, It's kind of like writing a rough draft, except you may send this email. Just don't put your mom's email into the "To" box yet, in case you accidentally click "send."

, Make sure it's 100% grammatically correct, its paragraphs are divided correctly, and it's easy to understand. Delete parts that make you sound selfish or expecting.
 Don't put "Sincerely, Amy Smith," put "Love, Amy and Fido (your pet)," or "Love, AmyMonkey (your nickname)."

, You don't want your email to be characterized by anything, and you don't want your mom to already have an opinion about your email before she's read it.
 She may not say anything about it to your face, and instead email back, so don't get in a talk before you know what's going on. She'll respond with clear, understandable words, so give her the chance.
 If she says no, don't reply with a "I didn't think you'd do it anyway. **** you, Mom." Be calm, and thank her for her listening to you. Since you were polite in the email, you don't want her to think that was just an act. If she says yes, sincerely thank her heavily. Don't act expecting or entitled, because it was generous of her to give in.

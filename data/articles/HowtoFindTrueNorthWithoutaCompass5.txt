 For this method, take your first reading in the morning, at least an hour or so before midday.
, The shadow will shrink before midday and will grow after midday.
 Use the string or object you used to measure the length of the initial shadow. When the shadow grows to exactly the same length as the string (and hence exactly the same length as your first measurement), mark the spot.
 Once again, this is your east-west line, and if you stand with the first mark on your left and the second on your right, you will be facing true north.

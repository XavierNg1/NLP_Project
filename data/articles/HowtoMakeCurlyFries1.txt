 A potato with high starch and lower water content will always be best for french fries. Try using russet potatoes that are slightly older, if possible.To help maintain uniform shape, pick larger, evenly shaped potatoes.;
, Using a vegetable peeler or a paring knife, cut the skin off the potato moving the knife away from you. Remove any bruised and unsightly potato bits with a knife.


Peeling is optional with fries. Keeping the skin on will keep them looking rustic, but peeling the skin away will leave your fries looking more even., After the potatoes are prepared, run the fries through your curly fry cutter.This often involves wedging the potato between the slicer and the handle. Rotate the handle to force the potato through the slicer. Different models may vary but should be used roughly in the same way.






Use a mandolin or fry cutter that contains a slicer for curly fries. This allows you to simply wash the potatoes and put them through the cutter. This equipment is available at most department stores and online.
 Soaking your fries in water removes excess starch and prevents the fries from getting stuck together.Soak your fries for five minutes and strain. Place them on a plate in a single layer then pat them with paper towels. Let them lay out for a few minutes to air dry.

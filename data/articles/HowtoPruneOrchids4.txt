 Make sure that the flowers are spent before you prune the orchid. The blooms should be wilted, and you should see the spike yellowing or browning.
 The flower spike begins at the tip of the stem, directly above the top set of leaves. Hold the spike still with your non-dominant hand, then use your dominant hand to make a clean cut at the base of the spike using a sharp cutting tool.


Avoid cutting into the stem.
While not always the case, the stem is usually green while the spike is often brown or greenish-brown.
The spike has no leaves on it, so you should be able to determine where the stem ends and the spike begins based on that.
 A strong orchid will usually have at least three mature stems, even though these stems will no longer flower. The best time to remove a surplus of old stems is when you re-pot the orchid.


The stems gather energy and produce food for the rest of the plant, so it's beneficial to keep them until they die completely.
When you do prune stems, choose stems that are leafless and yellowing. After removing the plant from its current pot, cut the horizontal rhizome--the horizontal root stem attached to upright, dying stem. Carefully remove the portion attached to any shriveled stems before transplanting the orchid into its new pot.

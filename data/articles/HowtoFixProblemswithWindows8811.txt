Your computer will now ask you if you want to keep your documents or fresh install. Either of these won't affect the process.
 If the power tends to go off in your area, ensure that your computer is plugged into an external power supply, that you can find at your nearest Electric shop. If your computer is a laptop/ultrabook/tablet make sure it has 100% battery and is plugged in throughout the process.

 Star Stable is known for it's amazing 3D quality, and just spending time relaxing and enjoying the scenery can give you a mood boost, especially if you're not too busy with quests and racing. Enjoying with a friend is even better. Try going to Fort Pinta Beach, and just let your horse and you relax near the sea. Try exploring Jorvik when sunset comes; it's utterly astounding!

, Not only will it give your horse that little XP boost, but it's good to practice, and try to fulfill those champion racer dreams. There are lots and lots of races everywhere, even a pony race! There are championships, too. Championships are a lot harder, longer, and especially when you're surrounded by level 15 know-it-all's. But relax, don't fret, because practice makes perfect, right? Try wearing better gear and clothes. To make your horse faster, get gear and clothing that says Swiftness 3 Swiftness 1 and 2 will work but the best players use all "swiftness 3" gear and clothing.
 When you are a Star Rider, there are thousands of fun quests to play, every single day. Some quests are daily, and don't give XP, but they give plenty Jorvik Shillings and improve your relationship with that place. Doing quests sometime unlock new places, and you have to be a certain level to unlock them, such as Golden hills Valley. But don't worry, you'll get there!

, There are many shops, so there's plenty of places to spend some of that extra cash!

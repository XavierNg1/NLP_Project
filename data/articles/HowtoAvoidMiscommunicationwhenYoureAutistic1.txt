 Another major part of communication of course, is speaking. Good communication comes from clear intent of what you want to communicate to them.  Be clear in yourself what you want to get across. Is it some information? Some experience you had? Some feeling you have? Some opinion? Do you want to invite them or just tell them something? You may just want to have a friendly chat. So, your intention is to communicate that you are interested in who they are and you want them to know who you are. Know what you want to communicate.;
, That way, you should be able to gauge if they have understood you or not. Speak directly and give some reasons or background. If they don't get it, you can say, "Actually, I mean...." and explain in a different way. Then, give some more reasons, to help them understand. Communication is about building a bridge from you to them.
 Non-autistic people have slightly different body language, and recognizing the cultural difference can help you understand how to show respect to them. Here are some things non-autistics see as signs of attention:


Looking in their direction (especially at their face)
Pointing your body towards them
Keeping your stims subtle (tapping toes, twisting fingers, squeezing stim toy)
Not looking at distractions
Conversely, if you want to hint that you're done with the conversation, do the opposite.
 You don't need to speak up the instant that they are done talking, nor do you need to say everything in one go. Take pauses, and let the conversation slow down. Give your conversation partner a chance to finish their thoughts, and then they will most likely let them finish yours.


Pauses can help let your message sink in. If you find yourself talking too quickly, stop and take a deep breath. Then let it out and continue.

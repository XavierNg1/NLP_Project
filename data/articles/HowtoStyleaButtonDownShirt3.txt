 While the button-down shirt alone screams polished and professional, the sneakers take it down a notch. You can take your shirt from work to weekend by pairing it some Converse or other casual sneakers. To complete the look, throw on a baseball cap. The shirt makes you look put together, while the sneakers and cap show youâ€™re ready to relax., While ties will naturally make the look a bit more formal, you can find more casual ties. Patterned ties look great with solid colored button-down shirts, and they are perfect for more casual settings. Even if no one else is wearing a tie, casual ties look like you put in the extra effort. They can add a lot to an otherwise simple look., Most people leave a few buttons undone at the top of their shirt, letting it expose a bit of skin near the neck. Instead, try buttoning up your shirt to the very top button, and then placing a big, eye-catching necklace around the collar. This is looks extremely chic, and can make any button-down shirt immediately look stylish.

 Pour the macaron mixture out onto the prepared sheet in a circular shape (it helps to draw the shapes onto the sheet first using a lid or other suitable circle template). Tap the edge of the baking sheet when you've piped all of the macarons onto the sheet––this helps the macaron mixture to settle in place.

 Place the macarons in the oven to bake for 10-15 minutes, or until they appear firm and glossy.

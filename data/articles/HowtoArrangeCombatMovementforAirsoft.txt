 When your team is moving as a group, you can advance in a few different ways:


A loose diamond (one person eyes front, one left, one right, and one checking flanks and 6:00),
Staggered columns (the image for this is slightly off, picture the left column a mirror image of the right) (two eyes front, Middle(s) right and left, and rear: flanks and 6:00). Those are for general movement in a non-combat situation.;
, when a team is moving while engaging move one person at a time so you can provide cover for each-other.



When you are superior (in this situation steadily advance on the enemy's position but be cautious you can still lose a team member even if you outnumber them, also be ready for an ambush).
When the enemy is superior (It is advisable to fall back to a better position, either get to high ground, good cover, or get entrenched and use your skill to take control of the situation if you take out a few of their members even when you are outnumbered the enemy may become demoralized and fall back, that is your opportunity to strike.

Advancing; (when you advance on an enemy make sure to know were their entire unit is, going after one person instead of after a territory can easily lead to an ambush or being flanked and surrounded, even with the upper hand make sure you have a clean exit route in case something comes up)
Falling back (when you are out-gunned or become separated from your team you need to fall back to a safer position, don't try to shoot your way out, move fast and low, and stick to cover whenever possible, try to randomize your movement so they can't let you run into their fire, it's always better to fall back with your team then to try to be a hero and hold them off)
Flanking (flanking can provide a huge tactical advantage, treat the enemy a a single point that you are going to circle around and entrap, the best way to get behind an enemy position is to have half the team provide heavy fire on their front or provide some other distraction so the rest of the team can get around them and hit their sides or 6.
 Ambushes can take out and entire team if done properly, when ambushing an enemy lure them into a spot by either having a team member be bait (a lonely ill equipped soldier looks like a tempting target) or in a capture the flag scenario have the flag be the bait, the bait should be in a position either in a low point or with no cover so when the enemy arrives they have no cover as well, place your team in a position to flank the enemy and prevent their retreat.


Superior firing positions can be a great advantage, when scouting out an area for a firing position look for waist high cover, high ground, trenches, and have environmental factors on your side, put the sun in their eyes the wind at your back and the rain over their head. since every battleground is different there is no one solution but use your head and try to make it harder for the enemy to hit you than you to hit them.

 A balanced meal consists of all three macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) in ratios appropriate to the body and lifestyle of the individual.However, many trainers recommend eating a meal focused more on carbohydrates the night before strenuous activity or sports to ensure sustained energy the next day.While recent research questions the efficacy of “carbo-loading” (the practice of “loading up” on complex carbohydrates in the days prior to endurance events), see what works for you.Give your stomach a couple hours to begin digesting the food before you hit the sheets to avoid indigestion and restless sleep., Have your jersey, socks, cleats, and other gear packed up and ready for heading out the door in the morning. Check the weather reports to see what extra layers or supplies you might need.

Your coaches and teammates are relying on you to show up prepared and on time.

 Using a kettle or small saucepan, heat 2 qt (2 L) of distilled water over a medium heat setting on the stove.


The water should be heated to a temperature range that is natural to the human body. Ideally, the temperature should fall somewhere between 98 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit (37 and 40 degrees Celsius).
 Add 2/3 cup (158 ml) of fresh lemon juice to the water. Stir well to combine.


Three average-sized lemons should produce an adequate amount of juice. Make sure that the juice is filtered before adding it to the water for your enema.
Lemon juice can cleanse the colon of excess feces while balancing the pH of the organ.
When used once a week, a lemon juice enema can soothe discomfort caused by colitis and chronic constipation.
Note that the acidity in the lemon juice can irritate the lining of your intestines, so it may cause some cramping. As such, this type of enema is not recommended for individuals with abnormally sensitive digestive tracts.
 Administer the entire enema and retain it for 10 to 15 minutes, or for as long as you can without causing cramping and other intense pain.


Since lemon juice is so acidic, it may not be comfortable to hold for extended periods of time. You should try to retain it for at least 5 minutes before evacuating to receive an adequate amount of benefit.

 Open up the paper clip so that one end is straight. The paper clip can now be used to scrape out debris. However, the metal can still scratch the inside of the jack.


A toothpick can also be used, but the pointed ends can also scratch the jack’s interior.Needles are useful for reaching lint and large debris, but can easily scratch the jack and should be used as a last resort.
 Use standard office tape (like Scotch or Sellotape). Tightly wrap the tape sticky side up around the straightened end of the paperclip. Before use, check to see that the tape is secure and won’t come off., Slowly move the tape into position. Don’t jam it in there. Reach for any debris you see. The tape forms a lint roller and will remove stuck debris and lint.

 To make a mask for dry hair, you only need the yolk, not the white. Egg yolks contain fat and protein that help moisturize and rejuvenate dry, lifeless hair. Separate the yolks from the whites and place the yolks in a small bowl.To easily separate an egg, crack the egg on the rim of the bowl. Hold the egg upright over a bowl and carefully lift the top half of the shell. Pass the yolk back and forth between the shell halves and let the white drop into the bowl, then place the yolk in a separate bowl. Alternatively, you may also use egg oil.;
, Pour the olive oil into the bowl with the yolks and whisk until the mixture is smooth and creamy. You should end up with about half a cup of mask mixture, enough to coat medium-length hair.









If your hair is very thick and long, add an extra tablespoon of olive oil.
If your hair is short, reduce the olive oil by a tablespoon.
 If your hair is a little wet, it will be easier to distribute the mask from your roots to your tips. Use a wide-toothed comb to comb the mask through your hair, making sure it coats every strand.









If you tend to have extra dry ends, use more mask mixture on your tips than on your roots.
If you end up with more of the mixture than you need, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.
 To keep things neat, you might want to put your hair up in a loose bun and cover it with a shower cap. Wait patiently while the mask goes to work on your dry hair.
 The shampoo will remove excess oil and egg, leaving your hair shiny and soft with no buildup. Be sure to use cool or lukewarm water so the egg doesn't "cook" in your hair.
 Either let air dry or use a hair dyer. Your newly moisturized hair should look softer and healthier now.

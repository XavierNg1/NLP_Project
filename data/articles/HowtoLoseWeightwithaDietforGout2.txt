 To lose weight, you should try to exercise for 30 minutes, five days a week. Start out with lighter exercises and work your way up to a more intense exercise routine. However, it is always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new exercise regimen if you have gout.Start out with light exercises like walking, swimming, cycling slowly, or gardening.
For example, you can start walking as part of your exercise regimen. Walk slowly and for a short distance when you begin. As you grow stronger, walk more quickly and for longer distances.
 Once you have started exercising more frequently, start working in some more intense cardiovascular exercises. Cardio exercises will increase your bodyâ€™s ability to use oxygen, which will help to metabolize uric acid and lose weight.


Try activities like jogging, biking, swimming, hiking, roller -blading and dancing.
 On occasion, a gout attack can be brought on by physical activities. If you have an attack of gout you should:


Lay down and keep your affected leg or arm elevated.
Bend the joint a bit while it is elevated.
Protect the joint and do not move it around too much.

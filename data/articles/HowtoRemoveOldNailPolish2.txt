 Some nail polish, such as glitter or gel nail polish, can be difficult to remove using the common rub-away method. In these cases pure acetone, the chemical that causes the paint to come off, is in order. Acetone is available at drugstores in the same section where nail polish remover is sold.
 Either place the cotton ball over the opening of the acetone bottle and invert it, or pour some acetone into a bowl and dip the cotton ball into it.
 Place it directly over your fingernail and use a piece of tin foil to hold it in place. Repeat with your remaining fingers until each one is covered with an acetone-soaked cotton ball.





If you don't have tinfoil handy, you can use a small rubber band to hold the cotton balls in place.









Have a partner help you if it's difficult to secure the cotton balls without causing them to fall off your fingers.
 Wait ten minutes for the acetone to work on the nail polish before you check to see if the method is working. Pull back one of the cotton balls and use a different cotton ball to swipe at your nail. If the nail polish wipes off onto the cotton ball, your nails are ready. If it sticks, let your nails soak for another ten minutes.
 One at a time, remove the cotton balls from each finger and wipe away the loosened nail polish with a second acetone-soaked cotton ball. The nail polish should easily wipe away. Repeat until all the cotton balls have been removed and the polish is completely gone.
 Rinse away traces of the acetone with warm, soapy water, then moisturize your hands to combat the acetone's drying effect.

 Plaque is accumulation of food byproducts and proteins in your mouth, and tartar is hardened plaque. The most common sign of plaque/tartar is a yellow or brown color to teeth or gums, but there are some tests that can be done at home to easily identify plaque buildup., It usually does not cause symptoms until you have a cavity or an infected tooth, but noticeable dark spots or white spots may be tooth decay. When this occurs, a toothache is the most common symptom, but dentists have a variety of high-tech methods, like fluorescent light, magnifying glasses, and intraoral cameras, to find problems., Gingivitis is basically redness or swelling of the gums. If left untreated it can turn into periodontal disease, with gums that become infected and pull away from teeth.If this fits you, your teeth may not just be sensitive, but they may also begin to loosen!

, Cavities are holes or structural damage in the teeth. There may be no symptoms, as cavities can be quite small. If symptoms occur, however, they may include: Pain, visible pits or holes in the teeth, or bad breath.Those little holes may be asymptomatic now, but could worsen and lead to sensitivity.
 Through biting and chewing actions, old fillings can crack at varying times. Look for a darker circle surrounding the filling, which is usually the sign of bacterial infiltration. Also look for deep fillings; they may be irritating the tooth's nerve and causing pain. Deep fillings can also cause a crack in the tooth structure that may even break your tooth, if you have a particularly powerful bite.
 Broken or chipped teeth obviously go beyond decay and can expose pulp - the home of nerves within the teeth beneath enamel and dentin - causing severe pain and sensitivity.Visit the dentist as soon as possible, before the chips/breaks cause significant sensitivity.

 If refinancing isn't an option, you may be eligible for pre-paying your loan. Pre-payment, also called early loan payoff, simply means that you pay off your debt before the agreed-upon end date of an existing loan.The benefit of pre-paying your loan is that you're not subjected to the monthly finance charges you would otherwise be paying on your loan, but for that reason many lenders charge a pre-payment penalty or fee.The terms of your existing loan should specify whether there is any pre-payment or early loan payoff penalty, but if you're unsure you can always consult with your lender.
 If your lender permits you to make pre-payments on your loan, there may be a special process for making those payments. These payments are sometimes referred to as principal-only payments, and it's important to specify to your lender that you intend for that payment to be applied to the principal loan, not the finance charges for upcoming months. Each lender's process may be different, so it's best to call or email the lender's customer service department and ask what you need to do to make a principal-only payment towards your loan., There are many early loan payoff "calculators" available online, but all of them factor in the same basic information to determine how much you will need to pay in order to payoff your loan early:

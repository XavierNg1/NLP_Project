 You might have one in the garden, or perhaps go for a walk in the local woods. Ensure that it is clean; scrub off any dirt and check that little beasts aren't living in it.


The branch should be the length of the mantelpiece for best effect and balance.
The branch needs to be a little curved at each end, as it cannot remain flush with the mantelpiece at the ends, or there will be nowhere for the stockings to be attached.
 The item used can be covered with a large ribbon bow or greenery, so if the attaching object is not so pretty, it won't matter. Suggestions include handheld clamp used for woodworking, large clips (like the sort used to keep tablecloths in place), etc. Or, nail some metallic shelf bars underneath the mantelpiece, having some of the bars hanging out for the branch to sit on. Wrap twine around the branch and the bars to keep in place.


Once attached, cover the attachment item with the bow or greenery, to ensure that it cannot be seen.
 Then hang the stockings on, ensuring that an even number of stockings is hung each end of the branch.
 When items are added to the stockings, check that they do not unbalance the balance on the branch.

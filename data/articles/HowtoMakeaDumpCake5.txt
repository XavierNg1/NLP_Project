, You can do this using butter or cooking spray. Set the pan aside when you are done., This will help break up any lumps or clumps, and give you a smoother cake batter., Cut the butter into cubes first, before adding it into the bowl; this will make mixing easier. Also, make sure that the butter is soft, but not melted., In a pinch, you can also use a plain old whisk, but it will take longer. Keep mixing until everything is evenly combined., If you are doing this completely by hand, keep mixing until the eggs are completely blended in, and no streaks or swirls of egg yolk remain.
 The cakes are ready when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean., Let the cakes cool in their pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes first. Then, remove the cakes from the pans and let them finish cooling completely before frosting them. The cakes must be completely cool, or else the frosting will melt., In a mixing bowl, stir together the heavy cream, vanilla extract, and sugar; do not whisk the cream yet. Chill the cream in the fridge for 30 minutes, then beat it with an electric mixer on medium speed until you get stiff peaks.

You can also use your own frosting instead. Buttercream frosting will taste delightful, but store-bought frosting will also do.
 Place one of the cakes onto a serving plate, and use a butter knife or an off-set cake decorating spatula to spread a thick layer of frosting on top. Place the second layer of cake on top of that. Use the rest of the frosting to cover the top and sides of the cake.

Add some sliced strawberries between the cake layers for extra flavor.
If you have any frosting left over, you can make little "stars" on top using a piping bag and a star-shaped decorator's tip.
Garnish the cake with some sliced strawberries for more color.

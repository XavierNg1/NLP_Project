 Babies enjoy watching balls roll around. Your baby can learn to roll the ball themselves, or roll it back and forth with a baby buddy. You and your baby will have hours of fun rolling the ball back and forth across a clean, soft surface., Your baby will have great fun with a stuffed doll. The stuffed doll could be a boy or a girl. It could represent a police officer, fire fighter, astronaut, or some other occupation. You could even give your baby two dolls to double the fun., With a stuffed animal in hand, your baby will begin learning all about the world of animals. You might, for instance, give your baby a stuffed monkey, cow, or pig. Teach your baby the appropriate sounds that the animal makes. For example, if you gave your baby a stuffed pig, say to your baby, “This is a pig. It makes a sound. The sound it makes is ‘oink oink.’” , Stuffed blocks are, like normal blocks, approximately cube-shaped objects that can be stacked and played with. You might, for instance, encourage your baby to build a wall with their stuffed blocks.You could also use the stuffed blocks to help your baby understand colors. For instance, you might take all the red stuffed blocks and pile them together. Point to the stuffed blocks and say, “These blocks are red.” Continue this pattern with other colors.

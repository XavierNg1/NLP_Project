 Any dish soap you have in your kitchen will work: Dawn, Joy, Palmolive, etc.


Use this method on white bras only. The bleach in the soap will remove color from dyed material, so donâ€™t use this for patterned or solid colored bras., Saturate the stain completely. Be sure to get the edges of the stain as well. You can even use an old toothbrush to rub the soap into the fabric.
 You can add a mild laundry detergent to help remove the soap. You may want to wash the bra again to ensure all the soap and detergent will be removed.Do not wring out the bra, but gently press the water out of it. Try gently rolling up the bra in a clean towel to remove excess water., The sun is an excellent bleaching agent, so this will help remove any lingering stains.Using a dryer to dry your bras can damage the fabric, including the elastic and underwire, and leave your bras misshapen.

 Sending nice postcards to people might increase the chance of them following you! Send postcards by finding an image and clicking or hovering over it, then click on the thing that looks like a postcard with a little heart on the corner of it.


Some people might only let you send postcards if they follow you!;
, Use popular tags like "hipster" "chic" or "grunge". Adding many tags to images will give it more exposure, and that will get you hearts and followers!

, Find images from image hosting websites and upload them. This will almost always get you more followers. Make sure you link them back to the original owner though! Never steal images.
, They will most likely follow you in return.

 Do not heat a muffin while it's still in the wrapper, as the wrapper may overheat or catch fire.
 Tupperware or other plastic containers may also be used, but make sure they are microwave safe and not prone to warping.
 Make sure the surface the muffin rests on is microwave safe.
 Individual microwave settings may vary. If you aren't sure that 30 seconds is appropriate, check the muffin every 15 seconds it is in the microwave.


If reheating multiple muffins, you will need to increase the time spent microwaving for each additional muffin. Thirty seconds for each muffin is a good start.
 It should be warm and soft if reheated correctly.
 Muffins can also be reheated in conventional ovens and toaster ovens.


For conventional and toaster ovens, wrap the muffins in foil and toast them at 350 °F (177 °C) for 10 to 15 minutes.
Muffins may also be cut in half and toasted with a little butter applied to each side. This helps ensure muffins do not dry out with reheating. You may wrap each side of the muffin with foil and toast at 350 °F (177 °C) for 10 to 15 minutes. Muffins may take less time to heat up, pending on your device's settings, so check on the muffins every 5 minutes if uncertain.

 Holding your crush’s gaze can be a powerful way to flirt, but you need to do it at a good time. There’s no way to plan for the exact moment, but aim for a time when you can potentially have their complete attention without too many distractions.Don’t choose a moment when your crush is distracted or busy. They won’t be able to pay attention to you. For example, don’t try to hold their gaze while they’re driving, reading, or working.
Good moments can be when you first meet and shake hands, when you’re handing them something, or when you open a door to greet them.;
, If you’ve chosen a good moment, this shouldn’t be too hard. If they’re introducing themselves or meeting you at the door, they’ll likely naturally make eye contact. If the context is more difficult, keep your eyes on them until they notice you looking.At a party or other social event, position yourself so that you can see your crush’s eyes. Keep your eyes on theirs as much as possible. Eventually, they’re going to look up and they’ll probably see you looking at them.
 Let your expression be soft. This can mean smiling slightly, or even licking your lips a bit. If you let your face freeze up or come across as too serious, it might look like you're staring rather than flirting.
 Normal eye contact lasts for about three seconds. However, if you can hold your crush’s gaze for four and a half seconds, they’ll get a powerful cue that you’re flirting with them. You can even hold it longer, if you like, as long as your crush doesn’t look away.If you’re nervous, you may be tempted to look away. However, try to maintain the eye contact to help build tension. You’ll seem confident and available, which are two powerfully attractive qualities.

 If you need to store or ship an extra-large item, you can combine two ordinary cardboard boxes. The two boxes will be stacked on top of each other, so make sure each one is at least half as tall as the item you plan to store. You can use store-bought boxes, or create two templates yourself using the instructions above.
 Tape the base securely, but leave the top open.
 Stand each flap on the top of the box upright, to extend the height of the box sides. Tape the flaps so they stay up., Tape the top flaps of the second box in a vertical position, as you did with the first one. Leave the base flaps open for now.
 Slip the second box upside-down over the first, with the two sets of upright flaps overlapping. Tape or glue the two sets of flaps together.
 Now you have one extra-tall box, with the open "base" of the second box serving as the top. Insert your object and packing materials through this hole, then tape the box closed when you are ready

Combine the juice from one lime with 12-16 oz. of cold water and 1-2 tablespoons of chia seed.
Stir occasionally until chia stays suspended in the water, as with the baking mixture.
Enjoy as a refreshing, nutritious and filling beverage.
Experiment with grape juice or other juices instead of water and lime juice for a different taste.



Add a two tablespoons of chia seeds to a cup of coconut water.
Let sit for ten minutes.
Like recently-introduced products from energy and sports drink companies, you'll have a thick hydration and energy gel that's great for runners' recovery or other athletic activity.



Goes slightly better with non-citrus juices, like grape, tomato, or cranberry.

 You probably wouldn't want to use the same prank on an 18-year-old as you would on a 7-year-old. Try to find a prank that will be appropriate for their age.
 You can get them into trouble with your parents, or simply prank them. It’s generally best to leave your parents out of it unless it’s a really serious situation. You might as well get your revenge in a fun way through a prank.
 Make sure it isn't a predictable prank. There are so many great pranks out there, there’s no reason to fall back on one that's boring. Pranks have all sorts of levels of intensity so choose one based on how much revenge you're looking for.


If you know good pranks, write them in a notebook and keep it in a place no one would look such as in your desk, under a pillow, or in a box. Keep your ideas secret until you decide to act.

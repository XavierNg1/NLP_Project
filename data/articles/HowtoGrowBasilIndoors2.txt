 Allow the soil to remain loose; do not pack it into the container tightly. Tightly packed soil will make it difficult for your basil to take root

, Do not over-saturate it, but add enough water to make the soil mildly damp.



Sow a few seeds an inch or two (2.5 to 5 centimeters) apart if using a round container.
Scatter seeds along the length of the container if using a long window box. If using this method, you must thin your basil out once seedlings sprout and reach an inch or two (2.5 to 5 centimeters) in height.
 Do not pack the soil down.
 Germination should occur within a week.
 The plants should be 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) apart to ensure adequate room for growth. You can either thin them out by snipping the basil off at soil level or by removing the basil by the root. Since snipping the basil off does not disturb any roots, it is the recommended method if you plan to discard what you remove. If you want to make use of every seedling, however, remove them at the root and transplant them.


Use your fingers or a wooden popsicle stick or tongue depressor to carefully dig the soil away from the base of a seedling.
Slide the tongue depressor under the developing roots or carefully "wiggle" the seedling, roots and all, out of the soil with your fingers after it is exposed.
Replant the removed seedling in another pot or in the same pot 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) away from any other seedling.

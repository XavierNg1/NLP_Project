;
, In a large bowl, beat the vegetable oil, applesauce, and egg with a stand or hand mixer.
 Incorporate the cake mix and raisins/cranberries into the batter.


For the best results and easier stirring, sift a small amount at a time in between stirring.
 Use a cookie scoop to form 1-inch (2.54 cm) balls and place them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet, about two inches apart from each other.
, Leave them on the cookie sheet for a few minutes. This is to allow the cookies to actually "set" while still piping hot.
 Set aside for about 15 to 20 minutes.

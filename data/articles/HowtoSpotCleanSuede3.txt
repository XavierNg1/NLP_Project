Dab the cloth or napkin, rather than rubbing it, to prevent the stain from penetrating deeper into your suede.
 You want to use quite a bit to create a little mound that completely covers your stain.


The cornstarch or baking soda will draw the oil up out of your suede item.
Let this sit for at least 10 minutes.
 To do this, you can use either a cleaning brush or a cloth. Remove all the powder so you can assess the stain beneath.


If it was a minor stain, it could be completely gone already.
If you notice a lot of residual oil or grease, repeat the process with the cornstarch or baking soda.
 If you repeat the powder removal process a few times and a bit of oil remains on your suede, you can use vinegar to remove it.


Simply dampen a clean cloth with white vinegar and gently wipe it over the suede.
Once the stain has been removed, allow the suede to dry completely.
 You can find these types of cleaners at leather stores or shoe stores. These types of cleaners are formulated to lifting excess oil out of the pores in suede, and bring it to the surface to be blotted away.


For extremely set in or old stains, you will probably need to use a suede cleaner.

 Put your stuffed animals out of sight in your closet, gift them to a younger sibling or store them in the attic. The last thing a mature-looking bedroom would ever have is a pile of plush dolls on the bed or lined up on the window sill.


Also remove any dolls and put visible toys out of sight. Store them in your closet or give them away. The same goes for childish books.
In order to make your room look more grown up, you have to be willing to put away some of your favorite childhood things.
However, you don't have to get rid of everything! Keep a favorite item out and store the rest away.
 Consider donating the items that are in good condition to a local shelter or Goodwill.


Simplifying and organizing your room will lend it a sleeker, more mature vibe.
Use brightly colored storage boxes to organize your loose items. You can organize your room and add a pop of additional color at the same time., Hang up all of your clothes neatly instead of leaving them in a pile on the floor. Get a hamper (bonus points for getting one that matches your room’s color scheme) and always put your dirty clothes in it. Keep the hamper in your closet unless you’re doing laundry.


Sort through your closet and get rid of any clothing and items that you’ve outgrown.
Get a new set of clothes hangers that are sturdy and identical. Get rid of any mismatched or broken hangers.If you want to go a step further, organize your clothing on the rack by color or by function.
 Keep everything clean and put away any loose items on the floor. Store your backpack, school items and sporting equipment in the closet and vacuum in there as well. Remove any loose trash and empty your trash can.


Keeping your room tidy definitely gives your bedroom a much more mature vibe.
 It's a simple act, but also a very adult one. Making your bed will instantly give your room an orderly and more mature atmosphere.


If you've moved your bed to be the focal point of the room, making it every day is a must.

 Cats can develop allergies to irritants in the environment around them, as well as to different foods. These allergies manifest themselves as itchy skin and occasionally diarrhea or vomiting. This itchiness can result in the cat licking herself too much, which damages the hair shafts; this in turn can make it look like she is losing patches of her hair.
 You may get a clue that your cat has an allergy to a certain pollen or grass if his itchiness or baldness is seasonal. For example, your cat may only lose fur in the spring or summer when a certain pollen is in the air.


If you see that your cat does appear to have seasonal allergies, talk to your vet about trial steroids. Some veterinarians will give cats some allergy-fighting steroids that may help to reduce the itch and allows the cat’s coat to return to normal.
 Unfortunately, food allergies cannot be controlled by steroids, and the cat will continue to react poorly unless the allergen is eliminated from his diet. Put your cat on a commercial, prescription diet (like Hills ZD or Purina HA). Do not feed your cat anything else.


It may take up to eight weeks to flush your cat’s system of the allergen.
If a food allergy was the problem, then after eight weeks on a hypoallergenic diet the cat should be more comfortable and should have stopped over grooming, which should result in the regrowth of the bald patches.

 If your headaches do not go away with lifestyle and other changes, see a doctor for evaluation. While usually not serious, chronic headaches can be caused by other medical problems. To help your doctor provide the best diagnosis, make a list of your symptoms.Keep a headache diary, chronicling when your headaches occur and any potential triggers.
Include the intensity of each headache.
You should also note how long your headaches have been occurring and any existing medical conditions you have.
 Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may want to run some tests to check for underlying conditions that may be causing your headaches. They may order a CT scan, MRI scan, or blood work to check for neurological or other problems.If your doctor orders any tests, make sure you ask them about preparing ahead of time. Some tests may require you not to eat or drink the day before, for example.
 Depending on what your doctor thinks is causing the headaches, they may suggest dietary supplements. Magnesium, butterbur, feverfew, and riboflavin are supplements that have reduced headache symptoms for some. Discuss dietary supplements with your doctor to see if they would be safe given your current health and any existing medications.Never introduce a dietary supplement before talking to your doctor first.
 Some doctors may recommend natural treatments for chronic headaches, such as migraines. Acupuncture and massage therapy may be helpful if you suffer from chronic headaches, so discuss these options with your doctor.Acupuncture is a technique where pressure points on the body are stimulated, often via inserting needles into the skin. Acupuncture has been shown to eliminate headaches for some.
Massage therapy involves seeing a professional masseuse to have your head, temples, and other body parts massaged to reduce the frequency of headaches.

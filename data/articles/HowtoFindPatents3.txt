 These can help you narrow your patent search. Consider what your invention does, what problem(s) it solves, how it works, and what its materials are to generate more search keywords.For example, if you have designed a humane and ecological mousetrap, you might try searching for "mousetrap," "recyclable," and "humane" or "no-kill." Read the instructions for each website carefully to understand the syntax for listing the words of your search.
 If possible, review any designs or artwork that are available from your search engine. Based on the illustrations you can find, you may get ideas for refining your search terms to narrow down your results., If you began your search with a single nation, spread out and use one or more of the international sites. In conducting your search, you need to think about the potential market for any product you have in mind. If you are hoping, eventually, to spread worldwide, then you need to conduct as broad a search as possible., When your initial search provides some useful results, you should then look at the actual applications for the inventions that seem most relevant to yours. Most of the online search tools provide access not only to the final patents themselves but also to application materials.If you review the original application materials, you will be able to see the original drawings and designs for the product, as well as the inventor's description. This information should help you determine whether your own invention is different enough to warrant a separate patent.

 While it is fairly easy to install small letters using a dry method, you are far better off using a wet release method providing your supplier offers this goof proof method of installation.;
, Some websites allow you to actually design your boat name lettering online, see it on a boat, then order it.
 The most difficult part of installing the boat name is that boat names are fairly large decals and it's real easy to tangle them or accidentally seal in large bubbles of air, which is a disaster. Not so with a good wet release system.
, Place this solution in a spray bottle. Bring this along with your wet release boat name lettering or registration number decal and a Rubbermaid kitchen spatula or other rubberized straight edge.
 Once in place, use black tape or any contrasting color tape to mark your position.
 Also spray the decal (sticky side) as you pull the backing away. This will prevent the decal from immediately bonding to the boat or to itself if you should fumble finger the thing.
 Slide it around until it hits your marks made in step 6.
 Once you are comfortable you have pushed out all the solution you can begin to push firmer and firmer. Go slow. The solution may be pushed out but the decal still has not bonded yet.
 Take a break. Cover the whole decal with a moist towel or at the very least, shade it from the sun. Time and moisture will cause the pre-masking to release both from the boat and from the decal.
 In about an hour, you should be able to pull the pre-masking off the decal and the letters will stay firmly in place.

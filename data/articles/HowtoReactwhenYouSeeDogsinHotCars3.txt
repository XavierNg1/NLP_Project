 There is incorrect information circulating around the internet about police officers saying it is okay to break a car window to rescue a dog. This is not true. In some states, it’s even illegal for police officers to break into a car to rescue a dog. Though you may feel the need to break a window to rescue a dog, realize that the action may be a misdemeanor or felony.Some states, like Ohio and Florida, have good Samaritan laws that may protect someone from charges if they break a window to save an animal or child left in a hot car.Check your state or country’s laws before breaking a window to make sure you don’t face criminal charges.
 Not all states and countries have the same laws about animal cruelty or dogs in hot cars. If your area does not have hot car laws, or you are not satisfied with them, consider contacting your local government to encourage them to make a law or stricter laws regarding animals in hot cars.Less than half of the states in the United States have hot car laws.If your town doesn’t have laws protecting animals in hot cars, talk to officials about getting a law put into place.
 Another way to react to seeing a dog in a hot car is to become an activist to help spread awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars. Some people don’t realize the dangers, or others may not think about it in the moment. Many animal groups have fliers, videos, stickers, and even dashboard sunscreens that you can distribute around your community to help raise awareness.Talk to local businesses about putting up fliers in their establishment or signs on their doors reminding people, especially during the summer, not to leave dogs unattended in hot cars.

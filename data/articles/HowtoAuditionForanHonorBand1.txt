 In most cases, you'll receive a piece of paper explaining the requirements for each instrument, including prepared exercises, scales, and sight-reading.;
, Your director may give you one, but if your music is found in a file on the internet or a method book, make sure to get hold of it as soon as possible.
 A friend, older band member, band director, or other musical acquaintance will likely be willing to help you out.
 This includes the chromatic scale, which will likely be a requirement as well. In many auditions, points are given for octaves - three octaves, for instance, will obviously be worth more than two (however, you may only get all of the points if you do well on every octave). You need all the points you can get, so if you can play a second or third octave, do so. However, keep in mind that you will most likely have a time limit to play the scales, so don't add too many extra octaves, and it's better to play "easy" octaves well than to try to max yourself out and play sloppily (which means you'll lose more points than you might have gained for the extra octaves).
 You can't practice the sight-reading piece ahead of time, obviously, but if sight-reading is difficult for you, practice will help keep you from being caught off guard.
 You want to have your instrument sounding its best.

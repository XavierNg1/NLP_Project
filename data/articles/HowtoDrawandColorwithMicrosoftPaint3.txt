 What you have to keep in mind is that MS Paint is not Photoshop. Don't expect to be able to get a Photoshop look with your drawings. You can make nice pictures but they have a very particular look to them. Embrace it. You should also keep in mind that the files save with poorer quality than programs like Photoshop, so don't expect them to print well at high resolutions.
 Know what sort of changes you can make to existing images, like photographs. MS Paint isn't Photoshop, but some basic tweaks can be achieved using the program. You can do things like:


Crop images. Cropping in MS paint can actually be easier than in some other programs, since all you have to do is drag around the corners of the image.
Cover small problems. Copying and pasting small selections that can band-aid small problems with an image is pretty easy with MS Paint, as long as you're patient.
Correct red eye. If you have some dark pixels you can copy and paste or if you feel like you can use the freehand tools, then fixing red eye is very doable in a program like MS Paint.
 If you're using MS Paint because you think you can't get a better program, don't worry. There are other options out there. Be sure to check out these alternatives to help you on your road to digital art mastery:


One program that you might find useful is a free program called Oekaki. This is similar in look to MS Paint but has many more features. You don't even have to download anything. Many websites have Oekaki as an app within a web browser. This program allows some actual layers, much like Photoshop, which means you can make much nicer pictures.
If you want to use a program that is more powerful but you don't want to spend the money on Photoshop, know that there are alternatives. Paint Tool Sai, Manga Studio, and many other programs which are similar to Photoshop can be purchased for $20-50.

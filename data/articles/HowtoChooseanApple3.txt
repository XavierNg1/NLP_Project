 When you’re picking fresh from the tree, the best apples tend to come off easily when you pull them. Grab the apple, lift it up slightly, then gently twist. If it comes loose, it is probably ripe enough. If it’s hard to make it come loose, then it isn’t ready yet., Apples tend to ripen first when they are on the outer branches, so when picking from the tree, stick to the furthest out. If you know it is later in the season, or the outside of the tree has already been picked over, move toward the inside. This doesn’t mean that the apples on inner branches aren’t ripe at all, just that they ripen slower., When you are picking from the tree, or even buying in the store, it is important not to drop your apples into the container you’re carrying them in. It may be quicker to pick and drop, but you’ll bruise the apples and they won’t be as good to eat.

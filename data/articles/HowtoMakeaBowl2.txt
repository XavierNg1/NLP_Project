 A plastic bowl is lightest and probably easiest to work with but you can also cover a glass or ceramic bowl provided it doesn't have a crack in it (even hairline cracks can break without notice and spoil this project).
 Labels from food cans or packages, magazine images, candy wrappers, tickets, or other items of nostalgic value or fun interest can be attached as the final layer of the bowl. Make sure that whatever you choose is enough to cover the inside and outside of the bowl.


Labels, wrappers, etc. that are crinkled need to be ironed first. Do this by laying the paper items on the ironing board, then placing a thin towel over the top. Iron on low heat, especially if the items contain plastic of any kind.
 Overlap the rim.
 A pitcher, jug, heavy glass, etc. can all serve as a suitable stand to hold the bowl aloft while you work on it.
 Tear lots of small pieces of newspaper and add to a pile. You'll need enough to cover the bowl 5-6 times.



Dip the pieces of newspaper into the glue mix and smooth them all over the bowl, both inside and out.
Let the first layer dry.
 Let dry between each layer.
 Hold the edges of the plastic wrap to help ease the paper bowl away from the real bowl. Set the real bowl aside to wash later.
 Paint the bowl one neutral color (white is an easy choice) to provide a neat background. Allow to dry.
 You can glue them in a pattern or simply add them at random. If creating a pattern, it's a good idea to sketch this out on paper first so that you have a guide to follow before sticking the pieces in place.


Be prepared to cut the paper decorations to fit your intended design. Overlapping them is also another option.
 Let dry. Once dry, it is ready for display.

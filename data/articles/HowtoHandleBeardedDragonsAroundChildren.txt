 Explain, before getting or even taking out a bearded dragon, what it's going to do. Most likely it will run, it will even lick some things, but make sure your child is aware of this and will not be startled. Also warn them that if they do get startled, it will be okay, and tell them how to act.;
, Be as gentle to your Beardie as possible so that he can stay calm. Don't give him to your child unless you feel they're comfortable.
 If it's a big Dragon, let them sit, but if it's pretty small, they can hold it in their hands. Be sure they are holding it the right way, and the Dragon looks calm. Always supervise when your lizard is in your child's hands.
 Most kids will want to see your Dragon move around. If you feel comfortable, put your Dragon down and let him move a little on the floor. Show your child how to handle him when he's on the floor.
 Do not play with your Bearded Dragon for more than one hour, because he might become stressed out and uncomfortable, and even tired. Put him away and show your child how to open the cage and close it.

 Morning exercise has a lot of important benefits. It improves your sleep and gets your metabolism off and running. Plus, those who maintain morning exercise routines are way more likely to lose and keep off weight than those that don't. , Waking up groggy with a work day looming can make exercise one of the last things you want to do. It will take discipline but getting moving first thing can build a healthy habit. You'll want to exercise at least three times weekly to make it part of a routine.


Treat your workout like an obligation. By allowing time each morning for it, you'll be more likely to stick to it and incorporate it into your daily routine.
Bring a friend. Sometimes it can be hard to stay on track by yourself and a workout buddy brings accountability. If you want to cancel, it won't be just yourself you're letting down and you can provide motivation for one another.
 Whether you like speed-walking or jogging at a local track, adding this to your mornings three to four times a week is a great way to lose weight and start your day. If you're new to cardio, you might want to start with a combination of walking and jogging until you build up stamina. Start with continuous movement, a mix of running and walking, for 15 minutes per morning and work your way up.


If you have knee problems or running is difficult for you, walking is a great form of cardio on its own. You donâ€™t need to run to get worthwhile exercise.
There is some debate whether cardio is better or worse on an empty stomach. It's probably better to eat first since too much exercise without fuel can have negative effects on your overall health.

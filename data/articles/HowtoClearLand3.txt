 The goats will eat the undergrowth around the larger trees. You can then sell the goats and harvest the larger trees.


Goat clearing is inexpensive for clearing land, but it does take time. The goats can get to places that machinery has a hard time reaching.
You will still need a way to get rid of the stumps left after harvesting the larger trees.

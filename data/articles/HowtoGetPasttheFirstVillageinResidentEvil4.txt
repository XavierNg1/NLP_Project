 Follow the path that is to the left when you face the village entrance. This is the easiest way to start collecting items because you are not seen as quickly.;
, Also collect the red, yellow and green plants. There are enough plants in the village to make one mixture of red, green and yellow herbs, and then you have one red and one green plant as well.


Note: to mix the plants, select one of the three plants and then select the “combine” button. Repeat the process until all three plants are combined. When you are done it should heal you completely and also raise your maximum health.You can also just place them on top of each other and they will mix







, The main buildings in the village are:




main buildings (four houses and a barn)
a tower
flat-roofed metal building
several shacks



, Save the last building on the right hand side (closest to the tower) for last because if you go into that house a video will start and you will get a chain saw guy coming after you making it harder to gather all the items.
 After the video there will be villagers at the window and door. Push the bookshelf in front of the window (the door will already be barricaded) so you have more time to gather items from the house.
, Run to this window and push the ladder so it falls down onto the ground below.
 Follow the ledge around the right side of the building. This will lead to a dead end.
 Take it if you have time. Villagers will pursue you.
 (Some will fall off the edge as you shoot them.) Save your shotgun ammo for the chain saw man, who will probably show up first.

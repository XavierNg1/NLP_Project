 The first section of your artist's statement should begin with a discussion of why you make art. Try to make it as personal as possible. Talk about what your goals are and what you hope to achieve through your art.
 In the second section of you statement, tell the reader about your decision-making process. How do you select a theme? How do you choose what materials to use? What techniques to utilize? Keep it simple and tell the truth.
 In the third section, provide some insight into your current work. How does it relate to your previous work? What life experiences informed it? What are you exploring, attempting or challenging through this work?

, Your artist statement is an introduction to your work, not an in-depth analysis of it. Your artistâ€™s statement should be one to two paragraphs and no longer than a page.


Your statement should answer the most commonly asked questions about your art, not overwhelm readers with irrelevant facts and minute details.
Brevity and efficiency of language are key. A good statement will leave your readers wanting more.
 An effective artist's statement reaches out and welcomes people to your art, no matter how little or how much they know about art to begin with; it never excludes. It should make your work more accessible, not obscure it with convoluted language filled with artsy jargon. Write in simple, straightforward, everyday language.
Make "I" statements rather than "you" statements. Talk about what your art does for you, not what it's supposed to do for the viewers.

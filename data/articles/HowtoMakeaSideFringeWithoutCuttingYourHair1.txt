 Grab your "side fringe" and brush through it with your fingers and pull it back so that it is to the side. The fringe is another way of saying bangs.
 Pinch the hair around a couple of centimeters from where it starts on your scalp.
 Once you have a firm grip of the strand you wish to part, pinch and twist it. Find the position you’d like it to rest.
 Wedge the bobby pin near the bottom of the fringe together with the hair underneath it. Hopefully this will make you feel more confident in your side fringe-less hair!


It doesn't matter if you get it wrong you always try again.

 If you smoke, you may want to at least do it with style. Smokers use their fingers to flick ash off a cigarette instead of tapping the cigarette on an ashtray.


You will need to flick the cigarette into the ashtray several times while it burns. You want to flick it when the ash looks like it might fall. Hold the cigarette between the thumb and middle finger.
Lightly tap the cigarette over the ashtray with your index finger. This is how you flick cigarette ashes. The process is sometimes called "ashing" the cigarette. As noted, don't tape the cigarette against the ashtray or you will look like a cigarette smoking novice!
Don't tap ash onto carpet or the ground or any surface other than into an ashtray. You could cause a fire.
 There is not one way to ash a cigarette. There are other methods that involve other fingers. Some people believe the way you hold and flick a cigarette reveals your personality.An alternative method is to hold the cigarette between the thumb and index finger. Then, tap the middle finger against the cigarette to ash the cigarette.
You could also hold the cigarette in your index finger and middle finger. Squeeze the cigarette tightly. Use the thumb to flick the filter. This should flick the ash into the tray.

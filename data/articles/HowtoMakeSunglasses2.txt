 Take apart a pair of cheap sunglasses and use the parts to create a template for your cardboard sunglasses. An easy way to do this is to lay each part on a photocopier and make a copy.


Alternatively, you can try to trace out the shapes of the parts using pencil and paper..
Cut out each part of the sunglasses from your paper template, leaving room to attach the earpieces.
Make sure to include eye-holes in the area where they should be present.
 Using glue, attach the arms to the frame. Be careful not to use too much glue, or it might soak the cardboard and make it too soft.
 On a sheet of acetate, use the cut-outs you made earlier when you cut the eye-holes to trace out the shapes of the lenses. Cut the shapes of the lenses out of the acetate sheet, leaving a little extra around the edges.


Acetate is a type of plastic. The type used here comes in sheets and is used as a thin plastic over in photo albums or presentation booklets. You can buy it at any office supply or craft store.
 Using any color you like, paint the frame. Acrylic paint is best for this, but if you don't have any, watercolors will do.
 Using a little glue, attach the acetate cut-outs to the frame. Again, you don't want to be heavy handed with the glue or you'll risk softening the cardboard too much.

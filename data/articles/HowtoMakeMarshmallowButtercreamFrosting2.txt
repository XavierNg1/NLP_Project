 Add 2 sticks (227 g) of unsalted butter that have been softened to room temperature to the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment inserted. Cream the butter on medium-high speed until it is light, fluffy, and smooth, which should take approximately 1 to 2 minutes.You can use an electric hand mixer to make the buttercream frosting if you prefer.
 Once the butter is light and fluffy, turn the mixer off and begin to add 2 cups (200 g) of marshmallow fluff and 1 ½ cups (188 g) of powdered sugar in ½ cup (50 g for the marshmallow fluff and 63 g for the sugar) increments. Mix on medium after each addition until all of the marshmallow fluff and powdered sugar are incorporated.Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula as you’re mixing the frosting to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully combined.
 When the marshmallow fluff and powdered sugar are fully incorporated, add a pinch of kosher salt to the bowl. Beat the mixture on medium to incorporate the salt and create a light, fluffy frosting, which should take 1 to 2 minutes.You can use the buttercream to frost cupcakes, cakes, cookies, or your favorite baked goods. It’s a particularly tasty topping for chocolate-based sweets.
Store any leftover frosting in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

 Write down the things that make you awesome to refresh your memory. Knowing why you are awesome and not being afraid to show it attracts others. Do not be afraid to make mistakes around him. Be authentic to the real you, quirks and all. Relax and make mistakes.
Do not act like someone you think that he would like instead of being yourself. Imagine if someone were acting in a certain way to please you, would you like that? Probably not.
 Invite him to a party that your friends are at, and laugh and enjoy your friends in his company. Check in with him, but also give him some space to interact with your friends. Talk to him later about how he enjoyed himself.


Hanging out with your friends around him will show him that friends are important to you and will help him see what you are in like with other people.
Hanging out with others could make him a little jealous (in a good way) and it might make him eager to talk to you again.
 You are a dynamic individual whose interests and personality will mostly likely not match his in all ways, and that is good.


If you can own the ways that you are different, for example, if he loves Family Guy and you think watching television is lame, don’t pretend that you have suddenly decided that television is really cool. Remember, having your own opinions is attractive.
Continue to pursue the hobbies you have that he has no interest in, and don’t change to be more like him.
 When you are in places that you love the best you will most likely come out.


He will be able to experience more about who you are through seeing the places you love. Explain to him why the place is important to you, and give him a tour of what is awesome about the place that you love.
Tell him stories about things that happened in that place. Ask him if there are places that he loves to go, and make plans to see those places.

 You will need:


Black leggings/slacks and a black top (or a black dress)
Erasable pen
White crayon/pen/tempera paint/butcher paper/poster board
Safety pins (optional)

, Some pens advertise being washable or removable, but it's still probably best to assume your outfit won't get totally back to normal.


Don't be too ambitious in details! Look at pictures of simple skeletons online.



You might draw, cut out and pin or glue white paper or poster/card board bone shapes onto clothing. Leave gaps in paper skeleton at joints (knees, hips, shoulder, neck, etc.) so it will not tear when you move and bend. Taping paper where pins will be inserted could help keep safety pins from tearing through paper.

Click on "Finder" from the desktop of your Mac, then point to "Go."
Select "Connect to Server." A pop-up window will then display and prompt you for the server address or IP address of the computer with the FTP server.
Enter the IP address and click on the "Connect" button. The format in which you should enter the IP address is "ftp://<your IP address>/." If you do not have the IP address, you will need to consult with the administrator (admin) for the FTP server.

 The cartridge inside is a cylinder tapering to a thin stem pointed upward. Depending on your model, you may need to remove one or more of the following before you can get to it:A retaining nut above the cartridge, removable with slip joint pliers.
A horizontal metal clip holding the cartridge down. This may be removable by hand or small pliers.
A tiny plastic retaining clip at the base or side of the cartridge. Use needlenose pliers to pull this out carefully. Note its position so you can reinstall it later.
 Look for identifying features on the cartridge, such as a tab or notch. Make a note of their position compared to the notches on the faucet body underneath it. If you later reinstall the cartridge in a 180ยบ position, you could switch the hot and cold taps., Grip the stem of the cartridge with a pair of pliers. Attempt to twist and lift without using excessive force. Some cartridges require a special tool to remove, ordered from a plumbing parts store.
 There are usually several O-rings along the body of the cartridge, plus a couple more on the faucet body. If any of these show signs of wear, replace them:


Cut away the old O-rings.
Apply nontoxic, heatproof plumber's grease to the new O-rings.
Slide the O-rings over the cartridge or faucet body to the same position.
 Line up the cartridge in the position you noted and push it down to fit into the faucet body. Reassemble the other parts on top of the cartridge.

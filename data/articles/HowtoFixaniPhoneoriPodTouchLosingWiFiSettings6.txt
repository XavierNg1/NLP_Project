 If your Wi-Fi issue only occurs on your home network that doesn’t broadcast its SSID (wireless access point name), try making the SSID visible. The IP address of your router is a set of numbers that you can use to access the settings of your router. Typically, this information can be found printed on a label found beneath your router and is usually something like 192.168.0.1.
Using your iOS device, tap Settings, then Wi-Fi, then and select on the name of your wireless network. Your router's IP address will be found next to "Router" on the resulting page., You can do this from a computer or your iPhone/iPod connected to the network from which you're losing Wi-Fi access.
 If you do not know the username and password, and it cannot be found on your router’s label alongside its IP address, visit http://portforward.com/default_username_password to see a list of default usernames and password.
 There are many different router manufacturers and models, so poke through the menus until you find the wireless settings. They may also be under a section called “Advanced settings.”

,, Remember to save or apply your settings and close your browser when you are done. Your wireless network should now be discoverable when scanning for nearby networks on a wireless device.

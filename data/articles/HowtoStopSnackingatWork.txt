 Sometimes, not liking your job or your assignments results in spending your time doing something else, and snacking is often a simple option. Reasons for snacking at work might include:


Avoidance of work
Overloaded with tasks
Hunger
Thirst
Boredom, to occupy yourself
Tiredness, to get energy
Stress, to relax;
, Think about the ways in which you can improve the challenge facing you. Some things you can do include:



Eat a larger breakfast: make more sustaining energy food choices;

Choose healthy snacks: over sweet and salty snacks (e.g., celery and carrot sticks, sunflower seeds);

Get more sleep. Go to bed earlier;

Change your work pattern. If you need to have lunch earlier, leave work earlier? Then you probably have to get in earlier too!

Ask for more challenging work tasks, or ask for less challenging work tasks, dependent on what is stoking your stress.

Create a procrastination attacker's plan. To get yourself over the humps of work you'd rather avoid, break it down into smaller chunks and tackle in smaller lots. Reward yourself with breaks rather than snacks.

Drink water, tea, coffee, in place of snacks.
Lock the snacks cabinet/cupboard!

, Sometimes exercise will be a better answer than food at work. Instead of spending 10 minutes snacking, do 10 minutes brisk walking, even in cold weather. It'll wake you up.
, If you're able to keep yourself hectic you may not even think about snacks. Responsibilities to complete may help keep the mind off lovely goodies.

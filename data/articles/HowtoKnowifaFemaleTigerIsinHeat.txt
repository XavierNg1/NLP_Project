 Likely you will be working in a zoo, a safari park, or working as part of a volunteer program looking after abandoned tigers in India or similar place. You might be a zookeeper, a zoo or safari volunteer, a guide explaining this to visitors, or a vet. If you are a vet, please improve this article. You can skip this step if you are just writing a biology paper at university.;
, Female tigers are not sexually mature until they are around 3 or 4 years of age, but usually come into season around 2 1/2 years of age., She is leaving her scent marks via strong pheromones in her urine so that male tigers know that she has gone into oestrus.
The tigress will become vocal. She will roar (which tigers do not do that often) in order to attract a mate. Tigers live far away from one another, so roaring is a signal to come nearer. "Vocalisations can be persistent and one female was recorded as roaring 69 times in only 15 minutes."She will not be averse to visiting male tigers. Although usually loners, tigers drop such reserve at mating time. A male tiger's territory usually covers that of several females and although the initial meeting might result in a fight, once they have checked each other out, the mating begins.
 Given the sad reality that there are fewer and fewer tigers in the world yearly, oestrus may come and go before the female finds a male to mate with. If she does find one, and all going well they get along, the female tiger will adopt the lordosis position for mating and the male tiger will mount her, bite the back of her neck and mate. This process causes pain to the female tiger, which stimulates ovulation.

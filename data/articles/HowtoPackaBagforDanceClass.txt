 Put them all on separate hangers and into one wardrobe bag (if you have many, you might need two). Put them in the order of your show, and keep all accessories with their costumes.;
, Get a durable, large bag with lots of internal pockets. You'll be able to find things faster if you know where they are.
 Alternatively, bring a plastic folder with some bits of revision you can look over. You'll never have to hang around doing nothing for an hour!

,,, Always keep the basics in your bag, such as:


Your dance shoes
Extra socks
Make-up removing wipes, and regular wipes.
Bobby pins, scrunchies, hair nets, hairbrush, hairspray, and hairbands.
Bandaids, toe tape (for blisters) and a small medical kit.
Water bottle and food. If allowed, keep dried fruit, bananas, or granola bars in your bag for times when you get hungry.
Clear nail polish. If you get a small run in your tights, coat it with some clear nail polish and let dry. It will stop the run in its tracks! It doesn't need to be fancy, cheap ones work fine. (It won't help much if the run is very wide, or very long. You have to get it the second it starts, or it's no good). It's also good to bring a sewing kit in case your leotard tears or the ribbons on your pointe shoes come off.

 When you draw the drapes at nightfall, give them a gentle shake. This will remove any dirt and dust from the drapes. Shaking the drapes a little each night makes cleaning easier, as it removes unwanted dirt on a daily basis., Drapes, especially sheer drapes, built up mild amounts of dust even with regular shaking. If your drapes are looking a little dusty, dip a chamois cloth in warm water and run it over the drapes. Wring out the cloth thoroughly before running it against the drapes.Make sure to read the manufacturer's label before using cloth on the drapes. Some drapes may not respond well to certain types of materials.
 When vacuuming, use the upholstery brush or another detachable nozzle to give the drapes a light vacuuming. Set the vacuum for reduced suction when washing the drapes.If your vacuum cleaner does not have a reduced suction option, place a nylon sock over the nozzle before running it over the drapes.

 Typically you can pull up the required statements through your online account, but you may need to take a trip to a branch.


Depending on the agency or lender asking for your bank statements, you may need to collect statements for several months or even several years.
Lenders or agencies may request bank statements rather than tax records because it gives them a better picture of your daily cash flow.
 Mark the deposits that you want the agency or lender to include in your income.


If a deposit's source isn't documented – for example, a client may have paid you in cash, or you may have transferred the income from another account – be prepared to find documentation to prove that the deposit in question is income that should be counted by the lender or agency in verifying your income., An index noting the page where each relevant entry appears, as well as a summary of your income each month, will be helpful to the agency or lender that needs to verify your income.


Keep in mind that if you use one bank account for self-employed business expenses as well as personal expenses, you may have difficulty documenting the transactions to a level acceptable to some lenders or agencies.

, Uber uses wi-fi and GPS to identify your exact, current location. If you are getting picked up from a different location, you may manually change the address by tapping on the box that lists your current location and typing in your desired pickup location.


Alternatively, move the map so that the pin (statically located in the center of the screen) is in the correct location.
 This box is partially hidden by the “Enter pickup location” box.
, Your finger should be placed on the light gray rectangle that lists the Uber car options available in your city.
 The expanded box will list the driver’s ETA, the MAX size of the vehicle, and your fare estimate.
, A “Fare Detail” window will pop-up on your screen. It will contain the following information:


Base Fare
Cost per minute
Cost per mile

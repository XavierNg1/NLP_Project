 Add 20 to 30 drops of your favorite essential oil to 2 cups (500 ml) of Epsom salt or coarse sea salt in a medium bowl or container.Stir well until all of the essential oil has been spread over and absorbed by the salt.
You can use any scent of essential oil you want to use. If desired, you can even combine scents to create your own unique fragrance.
 Mix 1/2 cup (125 ml) of baking soda into the scented salts until evenly distributed.


Alternatively, you could leave the baking soda out altogether and add it to your machine separately during the wash.
 Before your washing machine enters a rinse cycle, add the scented crystals directly to the water in your machine.


Only use 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of the fabric softener crystals.
If you did not add baking soda to the crystals, you can add up to 1/2 cup (125 ml) of baking soda in conjunction with this fabric softener per normal load of laundry.
Do not add the fabric softener crystals to the start of the washing cycle, before the washing part actually takes place. Only add it to the washing machine during the rinse cycle.
 You do not need to do anything special from this point on. Let your rinse cycle finish up as it normally would.

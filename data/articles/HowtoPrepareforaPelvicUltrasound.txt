Do not empty your bladder until the ultrasound technologist tells you., If you are unable to keep the water down (vomiting), it is likely your bladder will not be full enough because you are already dehydrated. Explain this to the technologist or your doctor. They have the option of doing an endovaginal/intravaginal ultrasound instead., Your bladder will fill more quickly on the day of the exam., Otherwise you will be dehydrated and will need more than the 4 glasses to fill your bladder. Likewise, things like partying with alcohol, a long airline flight, or too much coffee the day before the examination will also dehydrate you., On the day, you should be able to get by with only 3 glasses of water., If you are painfully full, be assured that you can empty your bladder quite a bit, and you will still fill back up within 30 minutes or so if you have taken all the required fluids., Let out enough to be more comfortable (more than 2 cups), then stop the flow with the pelvic muscles, or by starting to stand up, holding toilet paper to catch any remainder. Remember, if you let out too much, you will fill back up again.

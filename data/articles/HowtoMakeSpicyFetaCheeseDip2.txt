 Add ½ cup (143 g) of plain Greek yogurt, ½ cup (118 ml) of olive oil, 1 clove of minced garlic, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of lemon juice, 1 tablespoon (8 g) of chili powder, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of cayenne pepper to the bowl of a food processor. Blend the mixture until it is smooth.You can adjust the amount of chili powder and cayenne pepper to make the dip as spicy as you’d like.
 When the mixture is smooth, add ½ pound (227 g) of cubed feta cheese to the food processor. Pulse the mixture until it is smooth and well blended., When the first batch of feta is blended into the dip, check the consistency. If it’s not as thick as you’d like, add the remaining ½ pound (227 g) of the cheese and process the dip until the rest of the feta is fully incorporated.You don’t have to add all of the remaining feta cheese to the dip. Add it little by little until the dip is as thick as you’d like.
 When the dip is fully mixed, place it in a bowl. Mix in salt and pepper to taste, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap before refrigerating it for an hour or two. Serve the dip with pita wedges and fresh vegetables.You can serve the dip immediately after making it, but the flavors will deepen and meld if you let it sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours.

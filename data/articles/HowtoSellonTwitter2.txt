 Assuming you are already at least fairly established on eBay already, you'll simply need to create a listing for your item or items.
 A good way to share your item link on Twitter is to write the link item.ebay.com/123456789012, except replacing the numbers with your own item number. Avoid the usual "Look what I found on eBay!" share tool, because it's frequently ignored.
 Hashtags are a huge part of Twitter and can be used to your advantage. You can put your product under #eBay or under a category that the product falls in, like #Fashion, #Starwars, or #Toys.
 While you don't want to be screaming 24/7 at your followers to buy your products, it's a good idea to actually advertise, rather than simply stating that you are selling something. Point out if it's been handmade, gently used or new, a large memory for electronics, or any other features that it has to its advantage.

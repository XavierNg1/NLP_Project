 It is very important to do this thoroughly. Even a speck of yellow is no good.


The egg white determines how much mayo will be made; depending upon size, and season, about 1 cup oil, and 1 teaspoon vinegar, to each egg white.;
,, On top of the egg whites, set whatever your mind offers up to you for flavoring the egg white-olive oil frappe. Don't be afraid to get creative here.
 Sage and key lime mayo frapp√© d with homemade, jelled, iced fruit cocktail is sublime...lime juice cooks fruit and jello , so no leftovers (as if)...acids other than vinegar typically need to be doubled to 2 teaspoons.


In calculating an exotic acid here, consider what a teaspoon of vinegar (roughly 5% acid) would taste like plain, then understand that that is the impact, roughly, that your acid needs to have.
 If you're eating grocery store mayo, you're currently paying extra-virgin, cold-pressed prices for...that? You'll also see that you are paying free~range egg prices. Add about 3/4 cup of your preferred oil on top of the infusion, reserving 1/4 cup to "fill" the mayo. Your oil should be room temp also.
 Alternate methods will be given their due in a moment.


Ground the working end in the bottom of your mayo ingredients, turn it on, and raise slowly (four seconds to a cup). Dribble in extra mayo to "fill" the egg white; experience (and the state of the "gloss" on the mayo) will be your guide. Use immediately or refrigerate. Shelf life about 48 hours.

 You can either use heavy-duty aluminium foil, plastic wrap, or freezer wrap. Do not use plastic wrap if you are planning on freezing your fish.


You can also store your tilapia in a covered, airtight container.
 Try to squeeze as much air out of the bag as possible. If you are planning on freezing your fish, use a sealable freezer bag.
 If you are storing your fish the the fridge, you should only leave it in there for three to four days. If you are storing your fish in the freezer, you can keep it frozen for two to three months without losing quality.

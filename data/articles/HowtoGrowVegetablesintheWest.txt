 Because there are so many zones in this region, you need to look at your specific area; your state may have up to 6 different hardiness zones.;
, Follow the seed packet directions about number of days to sprouting and maturation so that you know how many weeks ahead of time to start your seedlings. This step isnâ€™t necessary in most coastal areas where the winters are very mild.
 Very few vegetables will bear fruit without at least 6 hours of sunlight daily.
 Remove all weeds or other plant material as early in the spring as is comfortable to work outdoors.
 Use a tiller or a spade. If you are not usually physically active, it is best to till a small section every day until you have tilled the entire plot.
 Work it in with a shovel or till your soil again to make sure the compost and soil are well mixed.
 Wait a few weeks after tilling before you plant. This will allow the soil to absorb nutrients from the compost.
 Cool weather crops, such as lettuce, thrive in cooler temperatures, but wilt badly under intense sun. Cool weather crops can also be planted in early fall.
 Don't plant any warm weather crops until after all danger of frost is over. Consult the seed packet directions to make sure you plant in time for the vegetable to mature before the first frost of the autumn.
 Your seedlings and transplants will need daily watering if there is no rain. Once the plants are established, water only when the soil is dry.
 Cover your vegetables with plastic or cloth to protect them from light frosts. Root vegetables can survive hard frosts if they are heavily mulched.

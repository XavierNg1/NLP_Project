Your left hand should still be holding and marking the ribbon you first pulled off., Your right hand should be holding and marking the ribbon that you just pulled off the spool. Bring your right hand and left hand together to make a loop in the ribbon., Now that you've made a loop, transfer it to your left hand and hold it firmly in between your fingers., Pull out another 12 inches of ribbon off the spool, using your right hand. Your left hand should still be holding the loop you just made.

 Make sure that your flash drive is connected correctly. You will need at least 4GB space on your flash drive to copy over the Windows installation.
 The program will format the USB drive to boot correctly, then copy the ISO file onto the drive. The copying process can take up to 15 minutes to complete, depending on the speed of your machine.

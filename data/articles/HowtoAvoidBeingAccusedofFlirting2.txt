, If the boy you are accused of flirting with, whether he is just your friend or you really do like him, does not normally hang out with your friends, then insisting that he be invited to outings after school will make things seem too obvious. Instead, suggest his name when the invitation list goes around, but do not push the issue.
 If you suddenly insist that one boy should be your partner in all projects, your study-buddy, and he should come over after school so you two can grab some tacos and talk about your latest book in English, it will only invite a plethora of flirting accusations. Besides being awkward for the boy, who will probably also receive teasing from his friends, it is just too much to seek the boy out in every situation.
 If you invite him to eat with you at lunch and he politely declines, don't do anything overly childish like pulling on his arm and saying, "Oh come on, Jason, you know you want to!". Your friends and him both will think of you as coming on too strong, even if you don't mean it.
 "Private" conversations, or when you take the boy out of a setting to hang out by yourselves, will instantly spark flirting rumors. It is far easier to call someone who wants to spend time alone with a certain boy a flirter than if she invites him to eat lunch with her group.

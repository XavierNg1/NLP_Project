 Having to make lunch for yourself or your toddler in the morning can waste valuable time and make getting out of the door harder. Instead of rushing, prepare a bagged lunch and put it in the refrigerator the night before. This is especially helpful if your toddler attends pre-K or daycare that doesn't provide free lunch., If your toddler has preschool or daycare, it's important that you get their supplies ready the day before. Scrambling to get school supplies ready in the morning wastes valuable time. Go over the stuff in your toddler's backpack with them the night before and remember to include special items like their favorite blanket or stuffed animal., If your toddler is too young to potty train, having your diaper bag ready to go in the morning can save you precious time. Even if your toddler is already potty trained, having a diaper bag filled with essential items may be a good idea.Items in your diaper bag should include things like wipes, diapers, toys, comfort items, snacks, hats, mittens, socks, and first-aid supplies.

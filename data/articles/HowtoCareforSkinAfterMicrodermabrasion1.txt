 Apply sunscreen about every three hours until your skin is healed. Also wear a hat and sunglasses when you go outside. Use moisturizer with SPF to better protect your skin from the sun.Look for sunscreen with 5-10% zinc or titanium or 3% mexoryl.
Consult your dermatologist for additional sunscreen recommendations.
Continue caring for your skin after you’re healed. Always wear moisturizer with SPF. Continue wearing sunscreen, a hat and sunglasses when you’re in direct sunlight.;
, Resume your regular routine, but avoid doing a lot of exercise the day after your microdermabrasion. Give your body this time to heal. Also avoid swimming in chlorinated pools for a few days after your treatment because the chlorine is very drying., Wait at least a week before waxing any areas that were treated. Check the ingredients in your skincare products for Retin-A, glycolic acids, fragrances, and/or a high alcohol content. Don’t use products with any of those ingredients for at least two days following your procedure., Keep your hands away from your sensitive, treated skin so it doesn’t become more irritated by the oils and bacteria on your hands. Wash your hands well before applying moisturizer or sunscreen to minimize those oils and bacteria. Also avoid scratching and picking at your skin.
 Give your skin time to recover after your treatment. Go ahead and schedule multiple treatments, but keep them at least a week apart. After your first few treatments, you might change to a less frequent regimen.

 Fuzzy ones work the best, however any socks will do. Why should you put on socks? Well, socks keep your foot bones from pounding on creaky stairs.;
, Usually, the middle part makes the most noise, so walk down the sides, with your back facing the wall.


Once you are on the floor, step off the stairs. Avoid being loud.



Take a flashlight with you. That way, you can see where you are going.

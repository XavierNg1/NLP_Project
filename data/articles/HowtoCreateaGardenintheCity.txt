 If you have a patio, balcony, or large window ledge you can use flower pots to grow your favorite veggies and herbs. Place an herb pot directly outside of your kitchen window and cut cilantro or basil while making dinner.;
, All you need is a small patio to create raised flower or vegetable beds using paving stones. You can make them as tall as you like in order to provide additional privacy from the neighbors. You can also create multiple levels of raised beds to maximize space. This will provide natural shade for veggies that don't do well in direct sunlight.
 If you don't have a patio consider hanging baskets. They can be hung from the ceiling above your door or even outside of a window, under an overhang. Plant your flowers, vegetables, or herbs prior to hanging. Make sure it is low enough to water and can easily be taken down to grab the veggies you need.
 You can purchase ones with hooks that use the inner wall for support. Simply fill up your window box with your favorite seeds and open the window to water your plants and pick your veggies.
 You can grow sprouts indoors and in small spaces. Even the most cramped of city apartments has space for sprouting.

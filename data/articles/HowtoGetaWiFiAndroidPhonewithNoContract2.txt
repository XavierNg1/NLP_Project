 Since your Android device doesn’t have a contract, that means you don’t actually have a phone service on it. However, this does not mean you won’t be able to use it to make calls. For this you would have to download one or more apps that will allow you make calls from your phone to other phones. The most used apps for this are Whatsapp, Viber and Skype. Facebook also has an option of calling through the Facebook chat app, but you won’t actually be calling a phone number. The person you call through the Facebook app will receive a voice call through the app, it won’t go through as a regular phone call. On Skype, you will have to buy credits to be able to make phone calls.


This will only work if you are connected to a WiFi network. Since you don’t have a contract, you don’t have cellular data available, so having WiFi is absolutely necessary.
 Again, since you don’t have cellular data on your device, you will have to rely on texting apps to get a hold of your friends and family. Facebook Chat, WhatsApp and Skype are the most popular.


As with the calls, you need to be connected to a WiFi network to be able to use the messaging apps. No WiFi connection, no fun!

 Also, find a hard flat work station such as your kitchen table to put your jacket together.
 Ask for their Oops Paint, which is just paint mixed into a wrong particular color, for super cheap, but make sure it will adhere to leather such as acrylic. Also, try municipal (Metro) recycling where you can get reconstitute recycled quality paint in five or six generic colors for $5 gallon!

Patches, Pins, Badges, Spikes and Studs: Grab a patch, or a pin, from a punk show. Cut up a band tee and make a patch from the band logo, and use the rest of the t-shirt to make your own creative patches. Also, check online for cheap supplies for patches, spikes, studs, badges, and even tools.

Material: Get cool material from old clothes, thrift shops, or scrap bins at craft stores or Walmart.

Chain: “Borrow” your dog’s collar.

Thread: You can use dental floss, or fishing line, which both make sturdy thread for stitching.

Dart Awl aka hole punch: You can use a really sharp ice pick for making holes for studs instead of a Dart Awl, or use different sized nails for different sized holes and hammer them through.

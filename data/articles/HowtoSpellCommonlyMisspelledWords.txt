 Though English isn’t known for its consistency, learning a few spelling rules can go a long way. For example:


“I” before “e” except after “c” or when sounded like “a” as in “neighbor” and “weigh.”

Some exceptions to this rule are “weird” (which is kind of weird, right?), “their,” and “protein.”
Words containing “cien,” like “ancient” and “science,” don’t follow the “except after ‘c’ ” part of the rule.
There are also a bunch of “eigh” words that don’t follow this rule like “eighty,” “height,” and “foreign.”



They’re with their things over there. To understand the differences, remember that:


They’re = they + are; the apostrophe marks where the “a” and the space used to be.

Their is possessive; after all, you can’t write it “their” without “heir.”

There denotes a location; you can’t write “there” without writing “here” any more than you can with the word “where!”



When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking. In words like “foe,” “toast,” “scream,” and “bait,” the vowel sound is determined by the first vowel, not the second. This is quite often the case, though many “ie” words (“chief,” “grief”) don’t follow this rule (not to mention the word “you”).
 Note the bolded differences between them; many of these should look familiar to you now that you have learned the rules above.

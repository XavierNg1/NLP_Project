 The bowl should be heat proof. Add the two tablespoons of boiling water very carefully. Let it sit for a few minutes., Heat the 1/3 cup of olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot (it should shimmer), add the almonds. Let them cook for about 3 minutes. They should be golden brown when they are done. Stir them often so they don't burn. Move them to paper towels or paper bag layers using a slotted spoon; let them sit to get rid of the excess oil. Leave the rest of the oil in the pan., While the pan is still hot, put the 3 to 4 cups of chopped onions in. Let them cook until they are golden brown. It should take about 15 minutes. Make sure to stir them once in a while so they don't burn. Move half of them to another bowl., Pour the rice in with the onion, and let it cook. You'll only need to cook it about 2 minutes to let it get toasty before you boil it. Frying it creates more flavor.If you want to add the optional spices (the 4 green cardamom pods, 4 whole cloves, 1 1/2 inches of whole cassia bark, 1-2 bay leaves, and 1 star anise), now is the time to do it. Add it just before the rice, and let it cook for a few minutes before adding the rice in., Put in the 4 1/2 cups of water. Also, add in the saffron that's been sitting, as well as 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Don't add the extra onions, the currants, or the almonds yet., Turn the heat up high. Once the pot has boiled, turn it down to low. Put a lid on it, and let it simmer. It should cook for about 20 minutes., After it has sat for 5 minutes off the heat with the lid still on it, it's ready to serve. Mix the extra onions with the currants and the onions. Scoop out the rice, and serve it with some of the onion-almond-currant mixture on top.

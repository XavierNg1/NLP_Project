 Check to see if anyone in your area owns and runs a mulching machine. This method is good if you have an area to clear with smaller trees, 8 inches (20 cm) or less, or an area that needs to be cleared around trees.


A mulch machine knocks over small trees, bushes, and brush and grinds them into mulch. There is nothing left to pile up or burn.
This type of clearing is also good if you want to clear around large trees. Some mulching machines are small and will fit between trees.
Mulch clearing is more expensive than other kinds of clearing. The mulching machine works very fast and is a quick way to clear land. Larger mulching machines cost more per hour but work faster clearing land.

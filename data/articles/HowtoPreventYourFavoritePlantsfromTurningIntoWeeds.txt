 You might be surprised to find some of your favorites are listed as invasive species within your locale. You can find this out in various ways:


Check out government sites online; look at departments responsible for plants, such as agriculture or science.
Ask at your local government advice service for pamphlets, booklets, etc. on such plants.
Talk to someone who knows about local plants and invasive plant issues at your local nursery or garden center.;
, By confining an easily spread plant in a container, you can still have the appearance of growing the plant in the garden but it's under your control in a container.
 If you stop the plant from going to seed, you'll stop it from spreading. Remembering to do this is the key; keep a note on your calendar for seed time. You might even make some of your child's pocket money contingent on plucking the seeds off before they spread, as a great way to learn about plants and to learn about the importance of taking responsibility for the impacts of your own garden on the local environment.
 Compost them in high heat compost bins if they don't have seeds or disease. If they have seeds or disease, dispose of them using proper green waste disposal methods, such as council (local government) collection or drop-off or tip disposal. In some places you may be allowed to burn piles of plant clippings; check with your local council.
 This is especially important with plants that contain bulbs (tubers) or still have roots intact––these can take root easily in the right conditions. Instead, dispose of properly.
 They may be your favorites but if you're aware that they're already a problem plant in your area, choose plants that are more suitable for your area instead. In many cases you may be able to find plants that smell or appear similar or produce similar characteristics to the one you can't grow but are native or non-invasive.

 The easiest way to check your math homework is to ask your parents to look over it when you are finished. If your parents don’t remember how to do the type of problems you are working on, you should try to teach them yourself! There is no better way to learn how to do something than to try to teach it to someone else.If they still have trouble, they can look online to refresh their memory.

Some good sites for going over how to do math problems quickly are Math is Funand Virtual Nerd., You can do this after school or before school if you have time. You can also call your friend in the evening and go over your homework together. If you both found the same answer, you know that your work is likely correct. If you found different answers, you know that at least one of you is wrong, and you can try to find the correct answer together.

When you compare your answer with a friend, make sure you are not just changing your answers without learning where you made your mistake. If your friend found the correct answer, have him or her show you how to solve the problem.
 Sometimes teachers give you free time in class. If they do, use this time to begin your homework. This way you can ask them if you are doing it correctly.

If you do your work at home but don’t feel confident about it, talk to your teacher as soon as possible the next day. They can quickly check your work, and you might have time to correct your answers before turning it in. Likely, you will get credit for trying your best.

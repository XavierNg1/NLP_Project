 That is, if your kids have never been to the beach, load them up and take them. If they've never been to the mountains, maybe it's time to go. Maybe they've never seen snow. Pick a cold destination. Seeing a part of the earth's geography they've never seen before is sure to stick in their memories., Plenty of locations cater to families and tourists. For instance, you could head to Florida for beaches and theme parks. Alternatively, you could head to Las Vegas for casinos and family-friendly entertainment. Pick one that has things your whole family will enjoy.You could also try a resort that has activities for everyone, such as Atlantis., Another way to make spring break memorable is to pick a city that has flair and its own unique culture. For instance, New Orleans is a great place to experience Cajun culture, cuisine, and music. You could also visit Santa Fe for a unique artistic experience. San Francisco is great coastal city with plenty of history., Nothing is quite as memorable as leaving your own country and culture completely behind if you've never done it before. While it is more expensive than a typical vacation in-country, it doesn't have to break the bank. For instance, consider visiting a Latin American country like Costa Rica. The most expensive part will likely be getting there. Once there, you'll find it affordable., Spring break isn't just about having a good time any more. It can also be about giving back. You can spend spring break with your family by joining a program where you give your time to a good cause in another city or country, such as helping build houses. Your kids may moan about it first, but it will likely be an experience they won't forget.

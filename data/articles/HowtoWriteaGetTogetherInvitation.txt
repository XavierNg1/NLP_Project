, Will you be asking everyone to participate in the food? If so, are you going to leave the type of dish to bring to each person, or will you tell them what to bring?

,, If formal, a nice paper, if tropical a paper with a tropical background, etc.



What you are invited to
Where the event will take place (small, typed directions with map may be inserted in the envelope)
When is the exact time and date.
How is what you are asking others to bring and if it is to be a special dress such as coat and tie, tropical dress, etc.
 If it is a very formal invitation such as a wedding you will probably want a professional printer to do the work. They will provide the paper you will provide the wording.
 List your email address or phone number for people to respond.

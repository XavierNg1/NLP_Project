 Tampons are made up of an absorbent material that is twisted into a cylinder and inserted into the vagina. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of insertion then you may prefer wearing pads. Pads are placed over your underwear and catch the menstrual flow once it leaves the body. Make sure to centre the pad in the area that goes between your legs. You donâ€™t want the pad to be placed too far forward or back. If the pad has wings wrap the wings around the underside or your underwear to hold the pad in place. Pads can begin to produce an odor after a while and as a result they should be changed every 3 to 4 hours., Whether you decide to use pads, tampons or a combination of both it is important to adjust the absorbency levels to match your flow. If you have a heavy flow you should wear a super absorbent pad or tampon. Pads with wings can also help prevent leaks. On a very heavy day you may choose to wear a tampon as well as a pantiliner to protect your underwear.
 You may find that a certain brand of feminine product fits your lifestyle better than others. Shop around and try a variety of different brands and types until you find the one that works best for you.

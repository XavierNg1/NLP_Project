 If you've got an add-on or toolbar installed that you don't want to use anymore, you can remove it from Chrome. Add-ons in Chrome are referred to as "extensions". Click the Menu button (☰), select Tools → Extensions. This will open a new tab with a list of all your installed extensions.
 You can scroll if you have too many add-ons to see on one screen.
 Confirm that you want to remove the add-on by clicking Remove.
 After disabling the add-on, you will need to uninstall the add-on software from your computer. You can do this from the Windows program manager.


Open the Control Panel. You can access the Control Panel from the Start menu. Windows 8 users can press Ctrl+X and select Control Panel from the menu.
Select "Add/Remove Programs" or "Programs and Features".
Find the add-on in the list of installed programs. The full list of programs may take a few moments to load.
Select the add-on and click Uninstall. The Uninstall button is located at the top of the list.
 If you can't get the toolbar to go away, chances are it's malicious and will require some extra work to delete. See this guide for detailed instructions.

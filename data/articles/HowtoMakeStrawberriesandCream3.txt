 Place them in a colander and rinse them carefully. Use a paring knife to slice off the green tops. Slice the strawberries in half lengthwise, then cut them into quarters.
 Add the sugar, orange zest, and lemon zest. Toss the ingredients with a spoon so the strawberries get completely coated. Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator to marinate for half an hour.
 Wash the orange and lemon carefully, then dry them off. Use a zester (or in a pinch, a cheese grater) to scrape off the top layer of peel, the zest, into a bowl. Continue until the zest has been scraped away, then half the orange and lemon and squeeze out their juices.
 Place the cream in a mixing bowl. Add the scraped out vanilla seeds and the orange and lemon juice. Beat the mixture until the cream thickens to form soft peaks., Prepare each serving in an individual martini glass or small glass bowl.

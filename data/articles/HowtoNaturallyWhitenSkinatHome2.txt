 There are a few dangerous myths going around regarding using bleach, ammonia, and other household cleaning products on your skin to try to lighten it. These chemicals are extremely harmful to skin, and they can do long-term damage. Damaged skin actually looks darker, so using these chemicals will end up doing the opposite of what you want. Avoid them.
 No matter what your skin color might be, it’s beautiful just the way it is. It’s fine to use safe items like lemon juice to lighten your skin a little, but don’t seek to completely change your skin color from its natural state. Instead of trying to have a different skin color, accept yourself for who you are. If you were born with dark skin, embrace your beauty, and don’t let anyone tell you to change.


Many women across the world hold themselves to beauty standards that prize light skin over darker skin. Many other women go to great lengths to get darker skin, paying for tanning beds and risking skin cancer to get a few shades darker. Doesn’t make a lot of sense, does it?
When it comes to having beautiful skin, the most important thing you can do is keep your skin healthy. It’s your body’s largest organ, and it deserves a high level of care. Eat well, stay hydrated, and exfoliate and moisturize your skin to keep it looking vibrant and healthy.

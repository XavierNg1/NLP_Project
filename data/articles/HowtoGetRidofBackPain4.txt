Stand with your back right in front of a wall. Back up slowly until your buttocks touch the wall. Assess your posture. If your shoulders, upper back and the back of your head do not touch the wall, you have forward posture, which increases stress on the lower back.
Squeeze your shoulder blades together slightly and touch them to the wall. Lower your chin so your head feels taller and touches the wall. Keep your legs hip width apart. Breathe into your chest and pull your stomach inward. Keep this posture. Return to the wall to test it every day until you start to make the necessary posture changes.
 Sitting up straight with lumbar support will reduce back pain.


Keep your legs at a 90 degree bend when you sit in a chair. Place your feet flat on the ground.
Ensure your wrists rest lightly on a hand rest in front of the keyboard.
Make sure that the computer screen is 18 inches (45cm) away from your face. It should be at or just below eye-level.

 After you have selected the appropriate attachment for the job, attach the piece to your deburring tool. You may need to consult your userâ€™s manual to determine how to attach the piece.


Make sure that the attachment is locked securely in place before you switch it on.;
, While some larger objects might stay put on their own, it will be difficult (and unsafe) to deburr a smaller item that is not secured in place. For example, a piece of furniture may not need to be secured, but a piece of wood or a pipe will need to be secured in place.


Try using a vice to secure smaller items and prevent them from moving around as you deburr them.
 Next, pick up your deburring tool and hold it firmly by the handle. Then, switch on your deburring tool when you are ready to use it.


You may want to start out by using the lowest setting and then increase the speed if necessary.
 Hold the tool so that it is right up against the edge you wish to deburr. For example, if you are deburring the edge of a piece of wood, then place the tool right up against the edge.








You do not need to press hard to deburr the item, just ensure that the tool makes contact with the edge of the object you are deburring.
 Start at one end and move all the way to the end, or select a starting point if you are deburring a circular item.








If you are deburring a pipe or other circular area, then you may just have to let the deburring tool rotate two or three times.
If you are deburring an edge, then you will need to drag the tool back and forth across the area two or three times.
 After you have finished deburring the item, remove the tool and turn it off. Then, check the edges of the area you just deburred to ensure that you got all of the larger burrs.If there are still some burrs left, then you can always go over it again.You can also sand the edges of the area you just deburred to ensure that it is nice and smooth. Use a fine grit sandpaper to sand away any minor imperfections.

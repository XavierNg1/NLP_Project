 Otherwise, you can irritate it. What's more, you want to work with a clean palette.;
, Give special emphasis to the area below your eye, nearest your nose. Smudge the eye pencil with a tissue wrapped around your finger for a smoother look. Be sure to let the edges of the "bruise" fade realistically.


Highlight immediately beneath your eye and the line that forms a crescent shape underneath your eye. These two areas get very puffy and inflamed when hit.
 Highlight the edge of the nose that got hit (near the corner of the eye) and just below the eye, where the last knuckle would land.


A cream-based shadow may be more effective, but matte powder will work, too.
 Use a stipple sponge, if you have it, to mimic a scrape. Concentrate the red on the corner of the eye near the tear duct and at the top of the cheekbone near the outer edge of the eye.
 Dab the brush on your hand before applying to make sure you're not accidentally concentrating too much product on any one area.
 Add these colors at the outer corner of your eye, your orbital bone, and the lower edge of the "bruise". When a bruise fades, it turns more to this end of the color spectrum.

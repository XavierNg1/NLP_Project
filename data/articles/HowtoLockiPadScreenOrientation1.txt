 You can assign the switch on the side of your iPad to either Mute or Lock Rotation. When one option is selected, the other becomes available in the Control Center.


For example, if the Side Switch is set to Lock Rotation, you will see a Mute button in the Control Center instead of the Lock Rotation button. If the Side Switch is set to Mute, the Lock Rotation button will appear in the Control Center.;
, This will allow you to change the Side Switch's function.
 Set it to "Lock Rotation".

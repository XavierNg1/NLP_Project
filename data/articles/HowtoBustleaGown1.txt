 Place a safety pin on the back of the dress, halfway up the length of the bride's train. This is where the loop will go. Thread the needle by doubling up the thread and inserting it into the needle. Tie the end of the thread with a knot to secure it.Insert the needle into the underside of the dress. Pull the thread all the way through.
Make a small stitch and pull the thread most the way through to create a loop.
Grab the loop with your fingers and pull the remaining thread through the loop to create a knot.
Repeat this process until you have a loop big enough to fit your button.
Secure the loop by running the needle and thread through the loop to tie it off.
Insert the needle through the fabric to the other side and make two knots. Cut off any excess thread.;
, Place a safety pin on the back of the dress, a foot above the bride's knees. This is where the button will go. Thread the needle and make a knot at the end of the thread. Thread the needle through the underside of the dress.Attach the button to the dress using the needle and thread.
Stitch the button four times to make sure it is secure.
Secure the button by running the needle and thread through the fabric to the other side. Make two knots and cut off any excess thread.
 Hook the loop over the button to lift the dress’s train off of the floor. Rearrange the folds of fabric around the bustle to make the bustle appear bigger and to give it more volume.The one-point overbustle is the least expensive way to bustle a dress, but it’s also the least secure.
The one point overbustle is only recommended for dresses with lighter fabric.
Do not try the overbustle if your dress is heavy or has a particularly long train.

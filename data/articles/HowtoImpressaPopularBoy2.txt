 In order to attract attention from a popular boy, you should dress as though you were a part of the popular group. They often wear expensive brands, such as Hollister, American Eagle, or Abercrombie and Fitch. Although you could purchase a few sets of clothing from those places, you should shop at different stores that sell similar clothing at a lower, more reasonable price, such as Aeropostale. Garage sales or Goodwill are alternate options, although you should never let people know that you go there.
 Although you should draw your inspiration from the popular people's outfits, never lose your own style. Dress fashionably, but add your own personal preferences in order to stand out. If you dress too similarly to the crowd, you won't easily catch a popular guy's attention. You may also be accused of copying.


Gradually ease into your new clothes. If you make an abrupt change, it will cause suspicion within people. They may spread rumors about you copying the popular people or attempting to impress someone.
 Your fashion and wardrobe should change as the year progresses. For example, when summer comes, find clothing in lighter shades, such as light pink, yellow, and purple. However, once autumn begins to hit, adapt to natural colors that inspire thoughts of earth and fall, including light brown or grey. Include skinny jeans, yoga jeans, or sweatpants in your outfits. Good winter colors are dark blue, purple, white and black. Meanwhile, floral clothing is popular in the spring.
 It is a simple way to add flair to an outfit. Have your ears pierced if you like, and start wearing necklaces with unique pendants. Purchase bracelets, watches, or rings to attract attention to your hands. However, beware of adding too many accessories, as you will appear tacky and unfashionable.


Employ the method of removing one accessory before you leave the house. If you feel that you have too many on, stick to your gut, as you may be right.

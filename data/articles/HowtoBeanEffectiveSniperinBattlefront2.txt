, The best spots are not necessarily on a high point, but you need to be able to see a decent portion of the battlefield. Just try to find a place that is remote from the battle, preferably a distant CP (Command Post), or any other place where you can find ammunition and health.
 It will probably not kill incoming enemies, but it will at least give you a warning of their presence (sound must be turned on).
 In order to support the rest of the army, you will need to kill the enemies that are the largest threats to the rest of your team and yourself. Therefore, start by eliminating the snipers. Many of them will be in predictable sniping spots (see the Tips section). If your team is using vehicles, then try to aim for the anti-tank units. If the battle is close-quarters, you should aim for the engineers. Otherwise, simply eliminate enemy soldiers.
 It's true that it kills most enemies, but the reach of the weapon decreases drastically. This means that the sniper can no longer fill its position on the battlefield: long-range shots.
 A good tactic is to point the cross hair at your enemy, then quickly switch the weapon to the sniper and fire. This is good since there is no cross hair when using the sniper. Eventually, you will learn where the cross hair should be.
,, This does not come automatically. Simply switch to your pistol and then switch back and you'll receive the new beam rifle. There are pros and cons for this. Pros: Powerful, fast rate of fire. Does not leave a trace to you. Kills target wherever you hit them on. Cons: Short range. If you are too far away the beam won't even hit the target. Lower ammo supply, and you cannot zoom in twice like with the original sniper rifle. All together, it works as a close-range sniping rifle, but the best bet is the original rifle.

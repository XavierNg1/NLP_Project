 Even if youâ€™re an omnivore, drain the aquafaba into an airtight container whenever you open a can of chickpeas. Sure, you may not have the incentive that vegans and people with lactose issues might have to use it for dairy-free cheddar or mayo, but you can easily use it as an egg substitute for an recipe that calls for them. Waste not, want not.Keep the aquafaba refrigerated and use within one week.;
, In general, the consistency of aquafaba is very similar to eggs. However, be aware that its consistency can vary slightly from can to can. Favor thicker aquafaba over thinner liquid when substituting it for eggs. If the liquid from your can appears watery, simply heat it in a small pot on the stovetop until it reduces by roughly a quarter before cooking., First, review the original recipe. See if it calls for one whole egg, the white of one egg, or the yolk of one egg. Then use the following conversions:


1 whole egg = 3 tablespoons aquafaba
1 egg white = 2 tablespoons aquafaba
1 yolk = 1 tablespoon aquafaba

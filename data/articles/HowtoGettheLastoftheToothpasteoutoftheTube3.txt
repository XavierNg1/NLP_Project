 For this method, you'll need a table or counter top with a smooth, sharp edge. Ideally, you will have one in the bathroom for easy access., Using your hands, squeeze the toothpaste up towards the top of the tube (where the cap is). Then, flatten out the bottom of the tube., Next, line up the bottom edge of the tube with the sharp edge of your counter. Then, while holding the bottom of the tube with one hand, apply firm pressure with the other hand., Finally, maintain the firm pressure on the tube while using your other hand to put the tube downward. You should be able to feel the last bit of toothpaste accumulating near the cap.You can achieve a similar effect by using a wooden rolling pin or a pencil.
 You should now have all the remaining toothpaste near the top of the tube. Simply squeeze the tube and apply the toothpaste as you normally would.

 By developing a training regimen you'll be able to improve your time drastically. Try doing the following exercises to train for a 5K:


Run up hills. Be sure to be perpendicular to the hill and lift your knees, using the proper healthy running form.
Run intervals. Run the mile four times, an 800 six times, a 600 eight times, or a 400 ten times. Vary these. Miles should be close to race pace with 3-5 minutes rest intervals. The 600s and 800s work best at 5 seconds per 400 faster than race pace and 2-3 minutes rest interval. 400s in 86-92 would develop adequate speed. Rest 1:30 between each 400
Practice speeding up when you run. Run a comfortable pace then speed up for about 50 to 100 meters then slow down again. Repeat.
Run hard courses. Most people do not run very fast when practicing so it is best to run hard courses to still speed up.;
, Don't overtrain. Remember it takes your body 3-4 days to recover from a reps session. Ideally do this on a Monday or Tuesday and race on a Saturday.
 Running 5K in less than 20 minutes requires running at 6:26 pace for 3.1 miles (5.0Â km). You need to be able to run at least a 6:00 mile before you run this 5k under 20 minutes. This alone still won't guarantee you your goal time. You must train regularly.
 Do not do push ups, pull ups or any other strenuous activities. Just stretch and spend time relaxing.


Eat pasta for dinner. Muscles receive energy from glucose which is found in pasta.
Go to bed early and make sure you get enough good quality rest before your big race.
Wake up early. Save yourself enough time to eat a good, but light breakfast at least an hour before the race.

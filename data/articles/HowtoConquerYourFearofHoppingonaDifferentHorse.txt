 Say "Great!," or "Fantastic!." or something nice, so your teacher knows that you want to proceed in your horseback riding. Try not to stutter, or mumble. Speak loud and clearly. IF you stutter, mumble, etc, you will indicate to your teacher that you are so scared that you can barely talk. Make eye contact while speaking to your instructor. Otherwise, you are telling them that you are nervous and afraid without even speaking.;
, Walk like you are on a runway. Meaning, walk with your eyes and head facing up, shoulders back, tall posture. Since this is a new horse, hold the lead rope closer to the mouth, but not too close. You have no idea if the horse can bite or nip at your hands.
 Check the girth to see if it needs to be tighter, and most of all, look to see if your teacher is watching you in case your horse spooks. But don't be scared if your horse does spook while hopping on, as long as you have your helmet on and someone watching you.. you will most likely be fine.
 If you hop on wildly, the horse will maybe react differently then your old horse.
 Pick up the slack in your rein, tighten your girth, adjust your stirrups, and lower your spurs (if so).
 When the time comes and you need to trot, ask the trot very quietly. No response? Ask for the trot a little harder and harder. You should get the trot now. Explain what you feel while trotting to your teacher.
 To ask for the canter, Sit to the trot, squeeze with your right leg, wrap your left leg around the horse's body, shorten the reins a little bit and you should be cantering by now. Keep your calves on the horse's body so your horse doesn't slam the breaks.
 Grab the slack in your reins, heels down, and take one leg out of the stirrup, then the other, and slowly go down from the saddle.
 Talk to other riders that have ridden the horse you have. Maybe there are some problems that both of you dealt with. But always tell your instructor if something is bothering you.

 You will be running out of warp disruption fields so you can escape. Some ways you can achieve this are to use a frigate with an afterburner or micro-warpdrive. You can also try an interceptor or shuttle.;
, The scout can report back on the status. Remember, some gate camps are not run constantly, but they may leave the mobile warp disruptor behind anyway.
 The combat ships should always jump before the escortee.
 If you can manage to jump through before being destroyed then every member of the camp that was attacking you will be unable to follow. Remember that if you return fire or use any offensive modules suck as NOS', webs, or scramblers you will not be able to pass through either.
 It takes two to disable every scrambler used against your ship, and if there's a large group camping the gate they're almost useless. They also greatly ruin your ability to fight back, a fact you should always keep in mind.
 If this is destroyed, you stand a far better chance of escape.
 In case of Disrupting Field (Anchored Bubbles or Interdictor's Bubbles) you should always cloak and try to re-approach the gate (or get out of the bubble and warp away).

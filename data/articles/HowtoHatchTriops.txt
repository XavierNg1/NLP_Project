,, Make sure the water is 22-30 degrees, if not then turn on the reading lamp that should be shining over the tank.
,, On day three add 1 crushed pellet to the tank. Do the same for day four. On day five, feed your triops one crushed pellet in the morning and one before you go to bed. Do this until day 7 seven, then you should add 1 non-crushed pellet for each triop in the tank. If all the food gets eaten add another pellet for each triop. You may have to feed your triops up to four times a day.
 Then simply add a fresh amount of water (it must be the same temperature as the current water in the tank)

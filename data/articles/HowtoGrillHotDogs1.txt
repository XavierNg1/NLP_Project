 If you have a charcoal grill, fill your chimney starter, soak the briquettes with charcoal lighter fluid, and light 'em up. Carefully, of course. Your eyebrows look good on you.


Allow about 20 to 30 minutes to burn off the lighter fluid and get the coals evenly burning. When the briquettes are covered with a layer of ash and glowing, they're ready. Pour them into the bottom of the grill, cover, and let it heat up.

Consider using hardwood charcoal instead of the standard charcoal briquette. It adds a great smoky flavor that marries well with hot dogs.;
, If you have a gas grill, turn on all burners to get the grill good and hot. You want the grill itself to sear the dogs as soon as they hit.


When you're ready to grill, you can turn down the heat to medium so you don't burn the dogs through and through. Not even Grey Poupon can help that!

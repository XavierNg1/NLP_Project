 You're thinking this one is too hard cause of draugrs and crap like that, right? Well it really depends on what gear you have., There is a secret chest in Winterhold if you climb up some rocks directly to the left of the jarl's longhouse. It generally has over 10000 gold and can be re-looted from time to time. Occasionally finding this chest will spawn a mission called "Secrets of the Empire"worth it! Usually, Draugrs will drop from 1-30 coin, and when you finish the boss battle, you can either disenchant the weapon you get, or you can sell it for usually about 100-3000 coin.,

 If you are in a cult that lives in a compound, such as a subdivision or shared home, pack a bag for leaving. Bring a change of clothes, practical items like your cell phone and ID, and anything with sentimental value. Stow your bag away where no one will find it until you’re ready to go.


If you think you may have to leave at a moment’s notice, keep your cell phone, your ID, and any money or small valuables you have on you.
If you think someone might find your bag, don’t take the risk of packing. Plan to leave your possessions behind if you need to.;
, If you’re leaving a live-in cult arrangement, try to line up a safe place to stay in advance. Consider staying with family or friends who aren’t involved in the cult, or search for shelters in your area.If you think you’ll be in danger after you leave the cult, go to the police. They can help you find a place to stay.
 If you’re not allowed to come and go freely, you may be able to make a break for it when other people visit the cult or when you’re taken outside the compound. Otherwise, call a taxi to come and get you, or ask a friend or family member to pick you up., If you’re living on your own, break ties with the cult by not going to meetings anymore. Plan to do something else during that time. If you’re idle, you may end up talking yourself into going back to the group.


For instance, visit a friend or family member during the time you’d usually spend at a meeting.
Be prepared for questions from the other group members. Decide ahead of time how you’ll respond and how you’ll avoid getting pulled back in.

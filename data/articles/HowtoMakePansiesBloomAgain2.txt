 To start, you need to consider the placement of your pansies. They should be in a cool, moist, protected area of your garden.


Consider placing them under a tree that will provide shade for the pansies.
 While the pansy plant is very hardy, its flowers will be eaten by critters, bugs, and anything else that might come along so try to plant them in a protected area.
 Pansy plants will look rough and not well cared for if they are placed in an area with large amounts of wind and rain. Try to reserve a safe spot in your garden for them that is shielded against the wind.
 If placed in a container, be sure your plant does not receive sun during the hottest hours of the day.


Move the container during the summer to a cooler area to encourage blooms year round.
 The reason pansies stop blooming is in the design of the plant. Pansies bloom early in the spring, produce seeds, then die back in the summer.

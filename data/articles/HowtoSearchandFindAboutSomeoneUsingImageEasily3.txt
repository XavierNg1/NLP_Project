 You can't use the Google Image Search website to search by image on a mobile device, but you can use the Chrome mobile browser to search instead. You can get Chrome for free from your device's app store if you don't have it already. This method works for both iOS and Android.


You can also use TinEye (above) by copying and pasting the URL for the image that you want to search with. Press and hold an image and select "Copy image address" to copy the URL to your device's clipboard. You can then paste this into the TinEye search field.
 You can't upload an image, but you can search using any picture you come across online. Use Chrome to navigate to the image that you want to search with.


If you only have an image file on your computer, upload it to an image host like Imgur first and then navigate to it on your mobile device.
 A menu will appear after a moment.
 This will perform a Google Image search based off the image you pressed.
 Google will provide its best guess for what the image name is, as well as provide links to pages that its used on. Visually similar images can be found at the bottom of the first page of results.

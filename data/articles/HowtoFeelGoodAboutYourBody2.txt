 Human bodies are amazing treasures with infinite uses, abilities, and surprises. Your body does so much for you on a daily basis. Take a moment to write a list of all the incredible functions that you gratefully notice about your body. Perhaps you can use your legs to run a 5k, your fingers to deftly strum the guitar, or your strong arms to swing your kids around. Rather than focusing on what you hate about your body, think about all the things you love., When you look at yourself in the mirror, don't search for flaws. Instead, strive to uncover aspects about your body that you appreciate. Maybe you have quirky dimples, a scar that adds character, or striking eyes. Take in the characteristics that make you who you are.After you have gazed at your reflection for a time, give your best smile. Blow yourself a kiss or produce your sexiest wink. Not only will this make you feel happier, but it will also gradually change your relationship with the mirror into a more positive, fulfilling experience.
 Spread the good vibes. Sometimes, all you need is a gentle reminder that you are beautiful, and that you are enough. Cut out several pieces of paper, a dozen or more. Write down positive statements to tape to your mirror or hide in unusual places so you can reap the benefits of these love notes later.


Your personal love notes can say things like:

Hey, there, good-looking!
Happiness isn't size-specific.
Love the skin you're in.
Beyoutiful!

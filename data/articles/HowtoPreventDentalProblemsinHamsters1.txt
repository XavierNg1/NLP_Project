 A hamster’s incisors (two curved, front teeth) grow throughout their lives. In the wild, hamsters eat a variety of foods (plants, seeds, fruits) to keep their incisors worn down.For your pet hamster, feeding pellets will give it something healthy to gnaw on. Make sure the pellets you feed are made specifically for hamsters.Feeding hamster-specific pellets will ensure that your hamster gets all of the nutrients it needs in the right amounts.
Seed mix is also good for hamsters. A seed mix with dried vegetables, pellets, grains, and seeds would be a very healthy choice for your hamster.Feed your hamster one tablespoon per day of either seed mix or pellets.;
, Your hamster might get bored eating only pellets or seed mix every day. Fresh fruits and vegetables will add variety and balance to your hamster’s diet. Two to three times a week, feed your hamster bite-sized amounts of fresh produce, such as carrots, apples, and spinach.Fresh produce will give your hamster something hard to chew on that will keep its incisors worn down.
Do not feed your hamster broccoli or cauliflower, since these could give your hamster gas.Wash the fresh produce first to remove pesticides.
 Hard dog biscuits will help prevent overgrown incisors. Once a week, give your hamster a dog biscuit to gnaw on.Depending on the size of the biscuit, you may need to break it into small chunks to help your hamster chew on it.


Make sure the dog biscuits are unflavored., Foods that have highly-digestible carbohydrates can contain a lot of sugar, which could give your hamster cavities. High-sugar foods to keep out of your hamster’s diet include commercial honey treats and chocolate.

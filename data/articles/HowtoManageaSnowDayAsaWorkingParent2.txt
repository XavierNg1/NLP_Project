 If you’re able to stay home with the kids, it can prove challenging, especially if you’re hoping to work a bit from home. It can help to plan the day together in the morning, and talk with your kids about the day’s activities.For instance, you can make plans to play outside in the morning, then come in for lunch, then have some quiet time, and then work on an art project or watch a movie.
Get input from your kids by asking what they want to do. Including them in the plans will get them excited to see the plans through.
 One of the best parts about snow days, in many kids' eyes, is the snow itself. Whether building snowmen, digging snow forts, or sledding is their favorite snow day activity, they’re likely hoping to play outside. Equally important: the time spent in the snow will tire your children out and keep them from getting too rambunctious while being indoors the rest of the day., Regardless of the age of your children, afternoon quiet time is a good idea for everyone. Young children can nap, and grade school children can study or read a book.Don’t take the “quiet” part of quiet time too literally. If one of your children wants to practice an instrument or listen to music, allow them to do so as long as they won’t interrupt you or their siblings.
This will also provide you an opportunity to get a bit of work done.
 You may try to regulate your children’s screen time by limiting them to a certain amount each day. On a snow day, however, you can relax these rules. Do note that a snow day is a special circumstance before allowing kids to watch an extra episode of their favorite show or play longer than normal on the computer.Just say something like, "Since it's a snow day, it's alright if you want to play Minecraft a little while longer than normal."
Extended screen time will give you the chance to get a bit more work done too.

 In general, aim to schedule a beach photography trip at the beginning or ending of the day. Less people will be present, allowing you to take photos without disturbing others. Sunrises and sunsets also produce better lights and angles for photographs., This is important for any type of engagement photos, including beach photos. Do not go in with a very specific plan. Be willing to listen to your photographer and take their suggestions. Try to do what feels right when interacting with your partner. Allow for some spontaneous kissing, cuddling, and hand holding., Weather can always affect a beach photo shoot. Check the forecast, but keep in mind things like wind and rain can come unexpectedly. Have a few days in mind to reschedule in case weather affects your plans.

 If you cannot fully remove the smell of burnt popcorn, there are several ways you can cover the smell until it fades away. Pour one tablespoon of vanilla extract into a coffee cup, then put it in the oven. Leave it in the oven at 300 degrees for an hour. The smell of vanilla is strong and very pleasant, and will mask the smell of burnt popcorn by spreading the vanilla scent all around your kitchen., Sometimes the smell of popcorn can get stuck in the vents of the microwave. There is no easy way to clean these, but taping dryer sheets to the vents can absorb bad and unpleasant scents. Take the sheets off the vents when you are using the microwave, and then reattach after you're done. , Cook other strong-smelling foods in the microwave. These can mask and cancel out the unpleasant smell of burnt popcorn. Any food like pizza that has high amounts of cheese is a good option for masking the smell. Other foods include bacon, soups, or sweet-smelling pastries like cinnamon rolls., Burning candles is a good way of neutralizing burnt popcorn smell. Buy candles in scents that you enjoy, and leave them burning whenever you are in the kitchen. Make sure to blow them out before leaving the house or going to sleep.

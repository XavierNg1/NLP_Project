 Take 5 to 6 cloves of garlic, and pound the side of a chef’s knife blade against them to smash them. Once the cloves are smashed, remove their skins and discard. Set the garlic aside for a moment.When you’re selecting your garlic, try to find cloves that are as large and thick as possible.;
, Place a large skillet on the stove, and add approximately ¼ inch (.63 cm) of olive oil to it. Turn the burner to medium, and allow the oil to heat for 3 to 5 minutes.You can reduce the oil to ⅛ inch if you prefer. However, keep in mind that by caramelizing the garlic in it, you’ll infuse the oil with the flavor so you can use it for pasta, salad dressings, and other dishes.
 When the oil has heated for several minutes, place the smashed garlic cloves in the skillet. Lower the heat to medium-low, and allow the garlic to cook until the edges have a golden color, which should take approximately 2 to 6 minutes.If the garlic looks like it’s turning brown, turn the heat down to low.
 When the garlic has caramelized, use a slotted spoon to remove it from the skillet. If you plan to use it right away, separate it from the oil. However, if you plan to store the garlic for later use, it’s a good idea to leave it in the oil because the oil will help preserve it.The garlic will keep for up to two weeks in the refrigerator.
If you’re separating the oil and garlic but want to save the oil for future use, pour it in a glass jar and store in the refrigerator.

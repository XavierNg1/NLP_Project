 If your oven didn’t unlock after self-cleaning, the temperature sensor may be broken. Unplugging the oven for a few minutes and plugging it back in may reset these controls., Some older models have screws on the front and the side that attach these portions of the oven. Unscrew them and lift the oven top to gain access to the lock within the oven.


Wear oven mitts if the oven has recently been on.
If you can’t find screws near the oven top, this means the connection is inside the oven. You will need to use a wire hook to unlock it from the inside.
Make sure the oven is unplugged.
 Unravel it and create a hooked end. Try to slip the flat side of the hook through the oven door and around the lock inside the oven.


Twist and pull up on the hook to unlock it.
Make sure the oven is unplugged.

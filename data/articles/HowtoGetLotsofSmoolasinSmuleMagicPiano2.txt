 The menu button appears as three horizontal lines. Tap the option that says "Achievements." Pick the challenge of your choice, and complete it. Once you've finished a challenge, go back to Achievements and tap on whichever challenges say "Complete" to collect your smoola.


Always do the daily challenge. Even if you don't win, participating in the contest will reward you with a 2x score multiplier. With this, you will begin to accumulate more experience and level up faster, thus earning more smoola.
Some achievements include playing a certain song, getting a perfect score, or unlocking something.
 This way you do not have to spend your current smoola to buy more songs. You will earn more experience to level up faster, and leveling up earns you smoola.


Try playing the song with a different instrument to level up.
Make sure to check your achievements and see which ones have a "Smoola Reward." Complete those first!

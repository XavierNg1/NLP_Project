 Even if you bought your juicer at $100, it'll be hard to move it for more than $20; good deals on electronics abound, so you've got to go lower than what savvy shoppers can find online.
 This includes china, flatware, baking supplies, and all other kitchen items. Make sure they've all been carefully cleaned before you put them on display.
 You could also have a "free" box with some of the least expensive items, so kids who come to the yard sale with their parents can take something home; perhaps their parents will also be more likely to buy something in this case.

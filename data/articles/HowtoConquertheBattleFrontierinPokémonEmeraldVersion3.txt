 The Battle Arena is located east of the Battle Tower and north of the Battle Palace. Sparring matches between Trainers and Pokémon are often held here. In this facility, you will fight with 3 of your own Pokémon against a series of Trainers. The only limitation: you only have three turns to defeat each of your opponent’s Pokémon. If you fail to defeat a Pokémon in the given turn limit, the match will go to judging. Again, if you win all 7 battles, you clear a round. This facility tests the power and will of you and your Pokémon. At the end of 3 turns in a battle, both combatants are judged on the following traits:

Mind. For every effective attack, a Pokémon is awarded 1 point in this category. However, no points are awarded. move used requires that the user be hit first (such as with Counter or Mirror Coat). A maximum of 2 points can be awarded in this category.
Skill. This category assesses a Pokémon’s accuracy. One point is awarded for every successful move. A maximum of 2 points can be awarded.
Body. This category measures a Pokémon’s vitality. The Pokémon’s HP (hit points) at the end of the 3rd round is compared to its HP at the beginning of the 1st round. The Pokémon with the better ratio wins the 2 points in this category.
 The Frontier Brain of the Battle Arena is known as Greta, the Arena Tycoon. She is encountered after the 28th and 56th battle in a streak. This means that for the Silver challenge, Greta will be the final Trainer of the 4th consecutive round. For the Gold challenge, she will be the final Trainer of the 8th consecutive round. Once defeated, she will award the respective Guts Symbol.

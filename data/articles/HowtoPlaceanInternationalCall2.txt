, Calling cards are generally cheaper than what your home or mobile phone companies will charge for making international calls.


Compare cards based on fees and services provided. Calling cards often charge various fees in addition to cost per minute, charge different rates determined by country, and have varying levels of customer support.
Pinless international calling cards are generally cheaper than using physical calling cards since there's no overhead for physical card production. These require you to dial a number before the number you are calling rather than insert your card in a payphone.

 For academic work, your attention-grabbing introduction is not your thesis, but it should lead up to it, and draw the reader in by articulating some point of your paper topic in a way that is both coherent, and applicable to the following text. For narrative—whether it’s personal or fictional—the first line is the first impression the reader has on the world of your story and whoever you’ve (re)created within it.


Academic paper. If you’re writing a serious, academic article, you’ll want an introduction that is clear, articulate, and intelligent.
Creative Nonfiction. What is meant by creative nonfiction is some sort of anecdote; these range from travel writing, to a personal story, to a biographical type of literature. They can be humorous, strictly factual and straightforward, and everything in between. One thing is for certain: at their core, there is a true story.
Fiction. The genre of fiction encapsulates everything else; whether it’s a novel about fairy princesses and dragons, or a simple short story about a man walking his dog; although it can be based on fact, at its core, fiction is made up and never actually happened.
 Don't be afraid to try different ways of starting your piece. If you're feeling brave, you can even combine them for an extra-strength, unique feel that's completely your own.

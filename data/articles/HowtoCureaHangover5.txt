 This is the best way to prevent hangovers. Remember that alcohol is converted to acetaldehyde, which is the primary underlying cause of not only hangovers but also almost every known alcohol related health complications from liver disease to oral cancer. Acetaldehyde is a class 1 carcinogen, a potent neurotoxin and also implicated in alcoholism itself. Google it.
 The liver can only eliminate the acetaldehyde in one unit of alcohol per hour on average. So alcohol is metabolised more slowly than it is consumed.
 Take 1 capsule for every standard drink consumed. Clinical results show 1 capsule of Alcotox is capable of reducing 86% of acetaldehyde contained in 125ml serving of 12.5% proof white wine.

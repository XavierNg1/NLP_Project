 They're relatively easy to come by on the internet. If you already have texture packs use one of them to edit.;
, Once inside, go to the texture packs file and open it up. Once inside place your freshly-downloaded texture pack file or and old one and open it up.


The texture pack is full of .png files and notepad files, you'll see a folder titled mobs inside that file there are a bunch of pictures with the names of the mobs they texture.
 Open up the file in Paint, or if you have it, MCSkinEdit.



When you return to the world of Minecraftia all the zombies should look like your re texturing

, Animals are hard to re texture however and take some practice. Have fun!

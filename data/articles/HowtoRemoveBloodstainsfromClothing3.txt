 Alternately, use a bit of detergent. Let it soak in thoroughly. Be generous with the amount you use and the time you give it.
 Ammonia is tough stuff and is great on stubborn stains. This is easiest with a cotton swab, though a rag will also do. If you don't have any ammonia, consider a few of the everyday household items you may have:








Club soda (poured directly onto the stain)






Vinegar (poured on and blotted)






Baking soda (2 parts water, 1 part baking soda, blotted)






Saliva (works best with silk)

, Use an enzyme detergent that is made for breaking down tough stains. Products like OxyClean are also advised.
 However, heat sets stains -- so if any stain is left, do not expose it to high temperatures. If it doesn't come out after two or three attempts, you may have to throw in the towel.

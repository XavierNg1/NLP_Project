 Artificial sweeteners are food additives often found in sodas and other store bought sweets. They can cause irritation to the bladder which can increase negative symptoms associated with MS. For example, many people who have been diagnosed with MS have some form of bladder control issue or experience dehydration. You should avoid artificial sweeteners to help manage these symptoms.Instead, eat natural sugars found in fruits and honey.
 Although lean protein and unsaturated fats, such as omega 3 fatty acids, are considered suitable for people with MS, saturated fats should be reduced and avoided. For instance, coconut oil, butter, cheese, red meats that are marbled with fat, and high-fat dairy products should be reduced in your diet.This will contribute to an overall well-balanced diet and can reduce the likelihood of developing heart disease and type 2 diabetes.For example, avoid fried foods and fast food.
 Fatigue and energy loss is a major side effect for people with MS. As a result it is recommended that you avoid sugary snacks such as candy, cookies, and sweets. Although sugary snacks can give an immediate burst of energy they will also cause an energy crash. Instead, choose snacks that will sustain your energy level.For example, choose snacks that are high in natural energy such as high-fiber cereal, nuts, and fruit.

 The easiest way to unlock Rosalina is to use a Super Mario Galaxy save file. Try borrowing a copy from a friend if you don't have the game yourself. If you can't get hold of a copy, you can use the Mirror Mode method.


Super Mario Galaxy will save automatically when you complete a stage, or select "Save & Quit" from the Pause menu.;
, After you have a Super Mario Galaxy save file on your Wii, you'll need to play 50 races to unlock Rosalina. You don't need to win the races, and they can be against your friends or against the computer. Make sure you're doing races and not Time Trials or Battle Mode.
 If you're sure you've played 50 races but Rosalina hasn't appeared, exit the game back to the Wii's main menu.
 Once you select your License, a notification that you've unlocked Rosalina should appear. If it doesn't, it means you haven't completed 50 races since adding the Super Mario Galaxy save file.

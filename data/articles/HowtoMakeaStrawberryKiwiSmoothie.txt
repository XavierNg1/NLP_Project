, Wash the strawberries and kiwi with water to remove pesky germs and pesticides. Slice the kiwi and strawberries into tiny pieces to allow it to blend easier and to prevent chunks in your drink.
 Put in strawberries, kiwi, water, and bananas into blender. Secure the lid onto the blender and blend away until no chunks are left.
 Pour the smoothie into a clean glass. Put a straw in for decoration.

, Using the <html> tags, create a .html file with either tags on a new line. Make sure to close the tag with </html>.
 Placing the <head> tags in between the <html> tags, define the head (metadata section) section. Make sure to close the tag with </head>.
 Below the closing </head> tag and above the closing </html> tag, add the <body> (content section) tags. Make sure to close the tag with </body>.


Optionally, add some 'test' code in the body (or content) section to make sure that you've coded it correctly. If the content shows, it means that the code is parsing (loading). If not, it means that you may have made a typo, or some other thing that is not letting it load.



Make sure to close the tag with </title>. These two tags can be on the same line. In between the starting and closing title tags, write what you want your title to say.
 Name your file as something.html, replacing something with what you wish. Remember that the index.html file is the 'home' or 'landing' page of your website.
 Browsers like Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox are good for front-end website development. Go ahead and open your .html file. You can use short keys like âŒ˜ Cmd+O or Ctrl+O to open the file in most browsers.
 If your desired title shows, the code has loaded and worked! If not, and it shows your filename instead (something.html), you may have made a mistake; check your code for typos then try again.
 You've just taken the first step to a fully functional website.

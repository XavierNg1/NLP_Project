 This is the most important thing you need to know. Look into each library on each platform. 3DS has the most and best exclusives so it will be best if you are looking for a different experience, PS VITA has the best multi-platform games, games ported to the vita are usually done well but the exclusives are a bit lacking, and Android has lots of games for any type of gamer with a good amount rivaling 3DS or VITA games;
, The PS VITA will be the most expensive at starting price, you'll need $250 for the system, $20 for the memory card and $40 for a game for a total of $310. You can get a decently powerful android tablet for $150, you'll need a moga controller which is $50 and a game which is usually around $10 for a total of $210. The 3DS starts at $169.99 for the original model and you'll want a game and screen protector for the top screen which will be around $220

, If you want to do things outside of gaming then the 3DS might not be down your ally unless the game library makes up for that for you. A vita has a decent amount of extra features like YouTube,dedicated email app, Facebook app, Twitter app and Skype. Android was not built with mainly gaming in mind so it will be almost like a mini PC when it comes to things outside of gaming

, If portability is a must for you then you will find the original 3DS to be the best in this category. It will easily fit into a pocket and it's small.If you want a bigger screen then the 3DS XL is an option. The PS VITA will fit into a pocket but it is pretty big so if you have skinny jeans then you will want a bag or case. For an android tablet you are most likely looking into 7 inch (17.8Â cm) models. These will slip into a bag very easily, however keep it mind you'll need to rest the tablet on a table and carry a moga controller if you want to play game properly

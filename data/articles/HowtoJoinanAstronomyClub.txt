 You can find an astronomy club near where you live in 1 of several ways:


You can type in "astronomy club" and the name of the city where you live in the search field of any Internet search engine to get a list of astronomy clubs that meet your criteria.
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory maintains a Night Sky Network website that provides an alphabetical list of astronomy clubs (http://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/club-list.cfm) as well as a search engine (http://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/club-map.cfm). Either type in the name of an astronomy club, or type in your address, city, and state, then select the distance away the club can be from where you live.;
, The club's website should state where the club typically meets (most often a college campus), membership dues, what upcoming activities are scheduled, and which are open to non-members. (Viewing nights at the club's site are typically restricted to paying members, but nights scheduled in public locations are typically open to everyone.) The website may also feature membership application forms and the opportunity to sign up for email notification of events.
 Astronomy clubs are devoted to educating the general public about astronomy. As part of this, clubs may set up displays at science fiction conventions or Earth Day celebrations, visit schools, and host viewing nights in city parks or state recreation areas. These events are open to the general public (or students, in the case of schools), and do not require an astronomy club membership to participate.


In the case of science fiction conventions, there is often a membership fee to attend, but this is for the convention, not the astronomy club activities being held at it.
 Once you've decided a particular astronomy club is for you, get an application form, (either online or from a member), fill it out, pay your money, and start taking part in its activities.

 Wheel of Fortune tapes at the Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California. If you live far away, book a plane ride to California in advance, and choose an affordable hotel that's near the studio. Your trip may require an overnight stay, so pack clothing and other materials that you'll want a few days before the trip.
 During a taping of the show, the show's announcer, Jim Thornton, will occasionally ask questions about the show to audience members, and give out prizes to people who give right answers to the questions. It's also helpful to learn about the studio audience experience so that you know what a taping of the show is like.
 If you arrive late, you risk not being able to get into the studio. Your seating location will depend on where you are in line, so arrive early to get the best seats. Make sure you have your ticket with you, otherwise, you won't be admitted into the studio.
 Watch the show closely, and follow all instructions you're given by the show's staff.

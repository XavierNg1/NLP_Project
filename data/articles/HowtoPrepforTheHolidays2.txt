 Do a deep clean in early November, after the Halloween decorations are put away. Find a place for everything early, so that cleaning for Christmas guests can be more superficial.
 To avoid clutter with decorations, take down trinkets and other decorations in advance. You will be ready to decorate if it doesn't seem like too much work to find room for them., Keep a box of versatile Holiday items that can stay up from October to January. Unpack and arrange this box and then start on specific Thanksgiving, Christmas or New Year's decorations when the time gets closer.

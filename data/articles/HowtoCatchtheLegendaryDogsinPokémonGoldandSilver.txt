 The Legendary Dogs, though strong, prefer to run on the first chance they get. To prevent them from running, get a Pokémon that knows the move Mean Look. This move prevents the foe from fleeing. Two best choices are: Gengar (learns at level 13) and Crobat (level 42).

, This makes catching them easier.
,, Keep in mind the dogs change their position when you enter/exit through a door or use fly to change location. The best preferred  location is Route 38 where you can easily switch location by passing through the western gate of Ecruteak City.
 Use Max Repel. Enter the grass and roam for around 15-20 seconds.
 If no dog shows up, then change location by passing through the door. This will change the locations of the dogs.

Come back to Route 38 and start searching in the grass with your Max Repel on.
 If you encounter the dogs even once, you can track them using your Pokédex. Just go to the Pokémon entry in your Pokédex and select Area., It will be sent out when you encounter the dog. Use Mean Look right away to prevent the Pokémon from running.







Start using your Pokémon to attack it using weaker moves. Scyther with False Swipe are good options.
 After many tries, you will catch the dog. Congrats!!

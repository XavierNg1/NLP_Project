 In a small bowl, combine your dry rub ingredients. To coat the drumsticks in the dry rub, dip the drumstick in the dry rub and massage it with your fingers so the drumsticks are completely covered in the rub.A dry rub is optional, but it will help your drumsticks stay flavorful and moist while they're grilling.
 Set your gas grill to medium-high or prepare a charcoal grill over medium-high heat with the charcoal all placed on one side of the grill. Place your drumsticks directly over the heat for five minutes, turning frequently.Searing will help the outside of the drumsticks cook quickly and get a golden color. Just watch it to make sure they don't burn.
 Use grilling tongs to move the drumsticks to the cool side of the grill (the side where there isn't charcoal). Cover the grill with the lid and let the drumsticks cook for 20 to 30 minutes before you check them.


Avoid cooking the drumsticks over direct heat during this time or the outsides will burn.
 Turn the drumsticks over using grilling tongs. Use a basting brush to cover the drumsticks with barbecue sauce and let them cook for another 15 to 20 minutes with the grill lid covered.Coat the drumsticks towards the end of the grilling time to avoid burning the sauce.
 Turn the drumsticks over again and baste the other side of the drumsticks with barbecue sauce so they're completely coated. Cook the drumsticks for another 10 to 15 minutes with the grill covered. Check the temperature to determine if they're done. They should be 165 degrees F or the juices should run clear.If you want to make the drumsticks appear darker, you can move them back to direct heat and sear them for the last few minutes of cooking.

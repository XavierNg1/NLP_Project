 If you regularly attend therapy sessions, tell your therapist how you’re feeling. They will be able to help you find ways to keep your mental health under control while you grieve. If you’re not currently in therapy, consider making an appointment with a grief counselor.Your therapist might help you come to terms with your grief by processing your feelings or performing rituals that help you mourn the person or thing.;
, Now, more than ever, it’s important to connect with your loved ones. Schedule visits with family members and friends, or pick up the phone for a chat. Talking through your emotions can help relieve the burden of your grief.Don’t isolate yourself, even if you don’t feel like going out or talking to anyone. Isolation will only make it easier for your mood to spiral out of control.
 Make sure your doctor knows what’s going on in your life, and keep them updated on your state of mind. If you notice your mood shifting towards either mania or depression, let your doctor know right away., Getting things done is harder when you’re dealing with both grief and bipolar disorder, so give yourself permission to ask for help when you need it. Your friends, family, and medical team may be able to help you manage practical concerns as well as your mental health. Help your friends and family know how to help you by making clear, direct requests.
For instance, you could ask a friend to help you cook some healthy meals to store in the freezer.
You may want to reach out to your local chapter of the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance for support, advice, and other resources.

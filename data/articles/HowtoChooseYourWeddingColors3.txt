 Read wedding magazines or visiting an art gallery to discover different color combinations. Although you don’t want to select a certain color scheme just because it is trendy, this may be a great place to find out which colors work well together., Most weddings use more than one color in the color scheme. For example, you may decide on two main colors and one accent color. It may be easy to list your three favorite colors, but what if they don’t match or work well together? You can consult a color wheel to help you pair your favorite color with a few accent colors.As a general rule, colors that go well together are opposite each other on a color wheel because this pairs a warm color with a cool color. For example, turquoise and coral pair nicely together.
The easiest way to think about color pairings is by selecting a bright color and a more neutral tone. For instance, blush and gold, or violet and grey.
 It is possible to go overboard with your colors. Perhaps your favorite color is bright pink, but you don’t want your wedding to look like a Barbie party. To avoid this, use the pink sparingly as a splash of color. Keep the rest of your colors neutral and then add a pop of pink in your bouquet, as ribbons around your centerpieces, or as the calligraphy on the menus.

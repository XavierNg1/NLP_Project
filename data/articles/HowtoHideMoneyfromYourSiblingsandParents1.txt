 You can hide cash in a book in between pages. Or, if you have a cheap old book, you can hollow out the book to hide your money.



To hollow out a book, you can carefully cut out pages.Pick a book that you wouldnâ€™t mind destroying, if you want to hollow it out!
Make sure you remember which book you want to hide things in.;
, Cash is easy to fold and to slip into narrow spaces. Remember, however, you may need to use a screwdriver to get your money back out again.
 You can put your money in a plastic bag, or envelop, and then tape it to the bottom or inside of a drawer.You can better hide your money, if taped on inside of a drawer, if you cover it with clothes or other items from your drawer.
 Chances are your parents or siblings do not want to go through your socks and/or underwear. Hide your money in the inside of a sock in one of your drawers.


Be careful not to throw the sock or clothes in the washer!

, If you have a video game or DVD case, you can hide bills in the insert or the cover.


Do not put coins in the case. They will rattle around or scratch the disk.
This probably would not be a good hiding place if your siblings/parents borrow your stuff without asking!

, If you have an empty shampoo bottle or deodorant container, you can use it to store coins.


Hide these bottles in plain sight or in a place where a bottle will likely to be seen. Coins will weigh down the bottle, so if it is picked up, it will be notably heavy.
Be careful not to put the bottle someplace where it will get thrown away.

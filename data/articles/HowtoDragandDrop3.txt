 Don’t open a new document right away, because you will use the drag and drop function to do so.
 Locate your file. If your file is on the desktop you can skip this step.
 Drag the file to the icon of your open program. When it is hovering over the program, release your mouse button.
 The program will open the file and bring it up on your screen. This function will not work if you try to open a file that is not compatible with the program you’ve chosen.

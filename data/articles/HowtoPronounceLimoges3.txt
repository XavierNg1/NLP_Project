 Use the following information to correct this common mistake.


The "ges" in Limoges is not pronounced like the words "guess" or "gaze." In fact, it is not even pronounced as a syllable.






The "s" at the end of Limoges is silent.






The remaining "ge" is pronounced as a consonant that sounds like saying the letters "z" and "h" together. This makes it sound very similar to an "sh" like in the word "shush" and "shoe" except you start with a "z" and then change it into an "h" as you say it. Hence, "ges" turns into the phonetic consonant "zh."







, The phonetic pronunciation is lee-mozh. If you want to confirm your pronunciation you can hear someone pronouncing Limoges correctly by visiting the online Merriam-Webster dictionary.

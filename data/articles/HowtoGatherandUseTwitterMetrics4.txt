 Then repeat with your Twitter name and "retweet" (because some people spell out the word when they retweet). The results will show which of your posts were retweeted, which means that your followers found them interesting enough to share with their followers. The higher percentage of your updates that get retweeted, the better.
 This will tell you how many retweets you're getting in relation to other Twitter users. Seek to raise your percentile.

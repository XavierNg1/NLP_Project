 Make sure you are completely finished with the remaining ketchup and proceed to give the bottle a good scrub. You don't want any remaining ketchup hiding inside the bottle or else you will end up with ketchup pancakes!


Rinse the inside of the bottle with warm water and then add mild dish soap and scrub. Use a thin, long scrubbing brush to get the inside of the bottle.
Rinse soap thoroughly and allow the bottle to dry.
Ensure that the attached cap is also scrubbed thoroughly. Ketchup tends to get stuck in the hinges and cracks, especially if the bottle has been used over time.;
, Hold in place with one hand and make sure it rests easily on top of the bottle.
 Stop pouring from time to time and check the bottle level to make sure you donâ€™t allow the bottle to overflow with batter.
 Use your Sharpie or permanent magic marker to label the bottle, so an unsuspecting housemate doesn't need some ketchup and instead get pancake batter.
 Always refrigerate unused pancake batter to maintain freshness.

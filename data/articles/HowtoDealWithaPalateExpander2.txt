 This is good oral hygiene that we should all be practicing regularly. Now is the time to make sure the habit sticks!

, A Waterpik focuses a tiny stream of water under pressure to clean hard to reach places in your mouth and is highly recommended for many forms of orthodontics and other dental work. Pay special attention to cleaning the central gears, screws, and edges of the expander and to places where the expander touches or covers your gum line.
 Excuse yourself from the table and use these to gently brush away any pieces of food that may be lodged in your teeth and expander.

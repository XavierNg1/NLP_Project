 There are several risk factors for gum disease that are out of your control. If you have any of the following factors, be sure to talk to your dentist about ways to prevent gum disease:


Diabetes
Family history of gum disease
Hormonal changes in women and girls
Medications that lead to dry mouth
Immune-affecting diseases like cancer or AIDS

 Almost all gum disease can be prevented by cleaning away plaque from your teeth, and your dentist or oral hygienist is the best equipped person to do so. Be sure to keep you your regular visits and you respect the indications given after the treatment.
 Unchecked, gum diseases can damage the tissue and cartilage in your mouth and lead to tooth decay. If you experience any of the following symptoms chronically you should make an appointment with your dentist immediately:


Bad breath that wonâ€™t go away
Red or swollen gums
Tender or bleeding gums
Painful chewing or a burning feeling of the gums
Loose teeth
Sensitive teeth
Receding gums (teeth appear "longer" than usual), Gingivitis is when the gums become inflamed or swollen, and is not particularly dangerous by itself; however, if it is not cared for soon enough it can progress to periodontitis, where the gums detach from the tooth, allowing bacteria to enter and damage your teeth. If your gums don't feel better with regular brushing and flossing then you may need antibiotics or surgery to prevent disease.

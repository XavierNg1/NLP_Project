 Here are the locations of Outland portals to Hellfire Peninsula from major cities. You must be at least level 58. You'll arrive at the Dark Portal (also known as the Stair of Destiny).



Note: if you are level 90+ the Stormwind portal and the Orgrimmar Cleft portal will take you to the Blasted Lands instead â€” but a new Hellfire portal will appear above them.
Orgrimmar: The Valley of Spirits (the troll area): magic users building or The Cleft of Shadows
Stormwind: Mage Quarter: Wizard's Sanctum
Darnassus: Temple of the Moon
Exodar: The Vault of Lights
Ironforge: The Mystic Ward
Silvermoon: Sunfury Spire: Magisters' section (on the right)
Thunder Bluff: Spirit Rise (near Pools of Vision)
The Undercity: Magic Quarter

, Even if you've never been in the Outland before, you should have access to the flight path from Stair of Destiny to Honor Hold.


The "Welcome to the Outland" quest will guide you to this flight path.
 Again, all characters know this flight path, even if they've never visited Shattrath before.


In the past, there have been bugs that closed off this flight path. This should be fixed, but if it does happen, take the southern exit from Hellfire to Terokkar Forest. Follow the road west at the first opportunity and you'll be heading toward Shattrath City.

 Be wary if an online school promises that it is fast and easy to earn a degree; this could be a sign that it is a diploma mill. A diploma mill churns out fraudulent degrees, certificates, and diplomas, and they can be earned with little to no effort from you. Real, accredited institutions require that you complete significant coursework to earn your degree., A scam school may request a large sum of money upfront for your degree, or offer discounts if you enroll in multiple programs. Accredited universities typically will not ask for a flat fee and will charge students per semester based on the number of credits taken during that period., If a schoolâ€™s name seems familiar or reminds you of a famous, prestigious institution, this could be a red flag.A scam school is counting on the chance that you may recognize the name with the hope that you will be sold on their program's authenticity.
 Check to see if the online school has a team of administrators, a technology support program, library services, and other resources for students. Support systems are important for academic success and should be in place in any legitimate academic environment. Be skeptical if the school does not offer this or makes it difficult to find this information., Take the time to review the instructors' biographies, educational history, their impact in their field of study, and if they have adequate publication records.A credible school and program will attract successful instructors who contribute to his or her specialty.
 Claiming a degree from an unaccredited scam school or diploma mill can have lasting impacts on your professional credibility and personal life. Listing the degree on your resume or CV will not help you in your job search; most employers will review a school or program that they have never heard of and begin to ask questions.A fraudulent degree can prevent you from securing a new job and can be grounds for termination or prosecution at an existing job.

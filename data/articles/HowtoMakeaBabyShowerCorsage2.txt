 You will use 5 of the 6 socks from the pairs to make the blooms for the corsage.


Be sure to save the 6th sock so that the mother-to-be can use all 3 pairs for her baby.
This design will also be suitable for either a lapel or a wrist corsage after the greenery and ribbon are attached., Start at the base, or toe, of the sock and roll inward., Hold the blooms in one hand and grab the five wires directly below the blooms with the other hand. Twist the five wires together until you reach the ends. Leave about 3” (8 cm) of wire trailing from the sock. Cut off the remaining wire.
, The blooms will now be facing forward, not upward.
 Twist the florist’s wire together to hold them in place.



This will also minimize the sharpness of the wire which could tear the sock or be uncomfortable to wear.

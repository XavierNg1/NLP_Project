 Be the first to admit what you did wrong, and you may get a lesser punishment.


Going to an authority figure and telling them what you did wrong shows that you are mature enough to accept the consequences for your actions. This might cause them to take it a little easier on you.
In some cases, you may get a lesser punishment like having to visit the counselor for a week, but this is better than being expelled.
 Saying you’re sorry means that you know and regret what you did, and may soften up your teacher or principal.


If you don’t apologize, they might take it to mean that you don’t regret what you did. If that’s the case, they may even give you a worse punishment to make you learn your lesson.
Tell them that you won’t ever do it again. This shows that you have learned from your mistake.
A well-written apology letter is a great way help get yourself off the hook. Good writing skills show a teacher how smart and mature you are, and they may be so impressed that they rethink punishing you.
 Be truthful about what you did wrong, but don’t admit to anything more.


If you genuinely don't understand why you got in trouble, it's time to have a talk with your instructor. Ask them what you did and how you can improve in the future.
If a teacher tries to accuse you of something that you really aren’t guilty of, don’t be afraid to stand your ground. You should not be punished if you didn’t commit the crime.
When you are being unfairly punished for something you did not do, then go to the principal. If the principal doesn’t believe you, then go to your parents. They are more likely to believe you and will speak up for you at school if they need to.

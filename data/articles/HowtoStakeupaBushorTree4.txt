 Guying a tree is used for larger trees, such as deciduous trees. Guying anchors are shorter and stronger, and so you’ll need 3-4 stouter wooden stakes. You’ll need to gather wire and padding for the wire around the tree as well.Since you’ll be using shorter stakes, make sure you mark them with bright paint so no one will trip!, You’ll want to place the stakes equidistant from the tree’s stem below the edge of the tree’s canopy. Make sure they’re at an angle away from the tree for maximum support., Attach the wire tautly, but not restricting all movement, from the tree to the stake. You’ll tie the wire around the stem above the first set of branches, also called the canopy stem. Be sure to use padding, such as a rubber hose, to protect the tree stem., If the tree’s root system seems firmly anchored in the ground, remove the guying system after one growing season.

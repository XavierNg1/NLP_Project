 Try to pick a store that will have several different brands of cribs, in many different price ranges.;
, Some people like having this option, although you usually have to pay extra for a "conversion kit". Make sure you consider whether having this option is worth it long term.
Some people like a drop down rail so they can better reach their baby.
Some people like to have the option to convert the bed into a toddler bed (by basically opening up the front so a baby can crawl out).
 Then, look on the Internet or in books like "Baby Bargains" to evaluate whether the crib is of high quality. Things to think about are the wood, the craftsmanship, where it was made, what kind of paint is used on it, etc. Make sure you prioritize what is really important vs. what others think is important.
 This is sometimes a sign of a maker you want to avoid.Â , Your baby will love it.

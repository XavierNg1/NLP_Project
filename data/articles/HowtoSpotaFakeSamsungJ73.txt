 As of October 2016, a brand new Samsung J7 goes for about $250. You may see some variation in that price with different retailers due to sales, but not by much. If you find one that’s only $150 and claims to be brand new, it’s probably not real., Samsung’s website has a list of all businesses authorized to sell its products. Visit http://www.samsung.com/us/peaceofmind/authorized_resellers.html to view the current list., If you’re buying a phone online from an individual on a site like eBay or Craigslist, you should always check the IMEI before buying. If a seller doesn’t want to give you the IMEI, you shouldn’t trust that seller.

 The source component is what you actually place the music media into - a turntable, a CD player, or tape deck, for example.


When buying a vintage turntable, look for a "manual" model; these tend to be more durable because there are fewer moving parts interacting with the tonearm. Make sure that the cartridge and drive belt have been recently replaced.;
, Be sure they are still available.


When choosing a vintage CD player, make sure to compare it carefully to modern models. Optical disc-reading technology has improved greatly since the 1980s, and many vintage CD players cannot reproduce sound as accurately as modern models.
 When selecting an amplifier for your stereo system, you have 3 options: a separate preamp and power amp, an integrated amp, or a stereo receiver (which is an integrated amp with a radio tuner). The 1970s are often considered a "golden age" for stereo receivers; receivers from this era sport the silver-faced and wood-wrapped aesthetic that has remained popular since.


A key consideration when choosing an amplifier or receiver is the total power available. An amp's power is rated as watts per channel, with smaller amps providing around 15 to 30 watts, and larger amps providing well over 100. For home listening, low-wattage amps will generally suffice.
Another consideration when choosing an amp is the "total harmonic distortion," or THD. This number expresses how much the amp can be expected to degrade the signal quality. The best amplifiers (most from the 1970s fit this bill) will boast a THD of less than 0.1 percent.
 When selecting a pair of vintage speakers, a primary consideration is the size of the speaker cones. A larger woofer will be able to produce a fuller bass sound, for example. Speakers that have 3 cones (a woofer, mid, and tweeter) will generally produce a richer sound than speakers with only 2 cones. Many speakers also have power recommendations printed on the back panel - speakers can be damaged if under- or overpowered.

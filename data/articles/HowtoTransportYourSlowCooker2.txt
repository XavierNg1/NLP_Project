 When transporting a slow cooker it is common for the contents to spill. This is especially true if you are transporting soup or other liquids. In order to prevent spills, secure the lid to the slow cooker. This can be done in a number of different ways:


Purchase a slow cooker that has a clamp on lid making it easy to seal the contents during transit.Secure the lid using painters tape. Simply tape the lid to the sides of the crockpot. Do this on all four sides.Use elastic bands to secure the lid. Wrap an elastic band around the handle of the slow cooker and then loop it around the handle on the lid. Do the same thing with the handle on the other side of slow cooker., In order to transport the slow cooker and keep the contents secure, place it carefully in a snug cardboard box or plastic bin. Use a box or bin that is only slightly larger than your slow cooker. The tighter the box the better.Fill in any gaps with extra tea towels.
 You can also purchase an insulated slow cooker carrier designed to transport slow cookers. There are a variety of different options available with easy-to-carry handles. Search online to find a carrier that fits the dimensions of your slow cooker., Once you have placed the slow cooker securely in a carrier or bin, position it in a safe place in your vehicle. For example, you could place the slow cooker on the floor between the feet of a passenger. This will prevent the slow cooker from shifting and moving while the vehicle is in motion.Do not put the slow cooker on a seat. The slow cooker could easily topple off of the seat spilling the contents all over the vehicle.

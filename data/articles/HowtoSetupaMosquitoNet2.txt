 Wedge nets work by wrapping under your bed and attaching to the ceiling in one spot over your head. Bell nets use the same principle, but they attach over the center of your bed. Thus, there has to be a spot over your bed to attach the net. This will usually be a hook, pin, or fixture on the ceiling.If you can’t find a spot over the head of your bed to attach the net, consider moving the bed to a more suitable spot.
An overhead beam will work at an attachment point.
If there are no good spots available, you can screw a hook into the ceiling or use a strong adhesive hook. Adhesive hooks work well in hotel rooms.
 Pull the net out of its bag and stretch it out on your bed. Also remove any rope or string that came with the net., Locate the part of the net that attaches to the ceiling. On some wedge nets this part will be a strip of thicker fabric; on other nets it will simply be a loop. On bell nets, there will be a small square of material that forms the top of the bell.Wrap a rope or string through the loop on your net and tie it to the anchor on the ceiling.
If the anchor is a beam you should wrap the rope around the beam several times and then tie the end securely.
 Drape the corners of the net around your bed and tuck them under your mattress. Make sure that you get every inch of the net tucked in.If there isn’t enough fabric to tuck under the mattress, you may need to lower the top of the net that is attached to the ceiling. You can do this by letting out slack on the rope or string you used to attach the net.

 Wash 1 1/4 pounds (567 g) of your potatoes. You can also use a mix of potatoes and root vegetables for a variety of nutrients. Leave the skin on the vegetables and cut them into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces.Ensure that the pieces are the same size, so they cook evenly.;
, Bring a large pot of water to boil and put the potato pieces into a steamer basket. Put the basket over the water and place the lid on the pot. Steam the potatoes for 12 to 15 minutes, so they become soft.If you have a small steamer basket, you may need to steam the potatoes in batches.
 Measure 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water, low-sodium chicken broth, buttermilk, or vegetable broth into a small saucepan or microwave-safe bowl. Heat the liquid until it's just hot.Heating the liquid will help keep your mashed potatoes warmer for longer.
 Take the steamed potatoes out of the steamer basket and put them in a large mixing bowl or pot. Carefully pour in the hot liquid along with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Use a potato masher to mash the potatoes until they're as smooth as you like.Avoid over mashing the potatoes or they may become gluey.
 If you'd like to keep it simple, just stir in 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper. Or for more flavorful mashed potatoes, stir in your favorite chopped, fresh herbs.While you can use dried herbs, fresh herbs contain a brighter burst of flavor and color.

 A standard baking sheet should be suitable for roasting macadamia nuts. A baking sheet is a long flat sheet that has edges to keep anything, such as nuts, from rolling or dripping off the sheet. They generally measure about 17 x 12 inches (43 x 30 centimeters) with a one inch high rim., Be sure to use nuts of relatively similar size. This will protect the smaller nuts from burning while the larger ones continue to roast. If you’re unsure, turn the nuts over several times while roasting to prevent burning. It is not necessary to season the nuts, as the flavor of the nuts themselves are delicious without any additives.


Do not have more than one layer of nuts, to prevent burning and uneven roasting.
 Salt and butter will enhance the flavor of the nuts and is a simple mixture you can make at home. Mix water, salt, and melted butter together and pour into a spray bottle. The proportion of each ingredient can be up to you. For example, if you enjoy the taste of butter, you can melt more butter and use less water. Spray your mixture over the macadamia nuts.To melt butter, place a small sauce pan on the stovetop and turn the heat to medium low.
Place the butter in the pan and wait a few minutes for the better to melt.
You can also microwave butter to make it melt. You shouldn’t need to microwave it for more than thirty seconds, as butter melts quickly.

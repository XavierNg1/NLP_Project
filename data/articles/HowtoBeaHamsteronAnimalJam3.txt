 At the pillow room (Jamaa's "Adoption Center" appointed by most players) say "Is hamster, needs owner." until someone adopts you. Or if you see someone advertising a school go there and ask the teacher if you can be the class pet. When you arrive say stuff like "looks around for cage" and say in ( ) things like (make me a cage out of Shoji Screens and pillows please) or just (make me a cage, please). When you have a cage settle down and move onto the next step.
 Go on crazy adventures, ordinary hamsters are boring. You might be a hamster who think he/she is a dog or you might have secret super powers! Being a normal hamster is boring to most people. They might send you to the pillow room or suddenly unbuddy you, lock their den, and leave waiting for you to leave the den. Be the greatest hamster ever! And remember to have fun.

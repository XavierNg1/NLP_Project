 This is the point in the throw where the pitcher releases the ball and is usually when his arm is highest. For softball, the ball is usually released just past the pitcher’s thigh. Start your swing shortly after the ball is released.


This is the best way to time your swing. If you know when the ball is released, you know when to start your swing.
 Other than grip, which is often impossible to tell, the way a pitcher follows through often determines a pitch’s movement. This applies for softball pitchers too, except their wrists snap up, not down.


If the pitcher snaps his wrist down then they are throwing a fast-ball or change up, which only moves vertically. These pitches are usually faster, so swing earlier.
If the pitcher torques their wrist to the side they are likely throwing a change-up or slider, forcing the pitch to move side to side. These pitches are usually slower, so hold your swing a half second.
If the pitcher does not move their wrists, they are throwing an unpredictable knuckleball pitch. These are frequently slow and difficult to predict

, When a ball is thrown closer to your body you can get all of your power behind the ball. As you swing, your body will turn and catch the ball on the inside, “pulling” it and making contact with the “sweet spot” of the bat.
 According to statisticians, the optimal height to hit a home run is between 2 and 3 feet off of the ground, usually in between your knees and waist. While everyone has their preferences, lower pitches are easier to get under and drive up and out of the park.

 Often times, people find it difficult to concentrate on their studies because they are overextended with other obligations. If this is you, don’t be afraid to tell people no. Just explain that you need to study and won’t have the time or energy to do so, if you help them out., Aim to work for 30-60 minute periods with 5-10 minute breaks in between. It is a lot easier to push yourself for a set period of time, if you know you have a break coming up. Your brain needs the break to recharge and to process the information.Schedule yourself to study different subjects. Studying the same thing for too long is a recipe for boredom. Know yourself. Do you get bored easy? If so, schedule your time strategically.
When are you most productive? Working when you have a lot of energy makes the work easier. If you know that you get tired at a particular time of day, schedule tasks that require less attention then.
Some people are early birds. They wake up early before most people even begin their days. They take this peaceful time to catch up on their studies. Other people are night owls. They thrive after everyone else has gone to bed. Their home is quiet and they can concentrate easier. Some people don’t have the luxury of waking up early or staying up late. Maybe you are one of them. If so, find a time in the day that you can devote to studying that works for you.
 Write down your study goals for that day. What do you want or need to accomplish?


Make sure they're doable. If you need to write a 10 pages in a week, schedule yourself to write 2 pages a day for 5 days. The task will no longer seem daunting and discouraging. This works for any assignment, whether you need to read a book, study for a test, build something for science class, or whatever. Break the task into manageable parts.

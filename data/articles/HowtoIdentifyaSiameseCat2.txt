 Siamese have distinctive fur colors and patterning, although there is no single coat pattern or color shared by all Siamese. Typically, Siamese have creamy white coats with dark patches or “points” on the muzzle and face, ears, tail, and feet. However, several variations on this pattern exist.These coat patterns are shared between both modern and applehead Siamese; the body shape and coat coloring are independent of each other.“Seal point” cats have dark brown points.
“Chocolate point” cats have lighter brown points, closer to the color of milk chocolate.
“Blue point” cats have gray/blue points.
“Lilac point” Siamese have the palest points. Their points are light gray, sometimes almost pink-tinted.
 Siamese cats are known for having bright blue eyes. The lids can be narrow, giving the cats’ eyes an almond shape.Their arresting blue eyes are a consistent characteristic between both show and traditional Siamese.


Kittens of nearly all cat breeds are born with blue eyes, which later mature into darker colors. The eyes of the Siamese stay blue their entire life, so they can’t be easily identified by eye color as kittens.
 Both types of Siamese cat have distinctive, recognizable ears. The modern Siamese especially has a specific ear style: its ears are large, and shaped like triangles or wedges. In some purebred modern Siamese, the ears may be nearly as large as the head itself. The ears of an applehead Siamese are more proportional to its body, and less angular and pointed.The ears of an applehead Siamese will also be closer together on the top of its head. Due to their shape and size, the ears of a modern Siamese can be far apart on the cat’s head.

 It's not only about your face but it's about your entire body. But having a "serious" face often shows that you know what you are doing. This will often impress your opponents which can be used as an advantage. Using sun-glasses helps when you are not good with eye contact and they're great when it's bright under the lights of Las Vegas or Atlantic City.;
, If you don't control your body and you are shaking or acting really nervous when you are about to make your move, opponents will know and fold instead of betting (maybe not the first time but after that).
 Don't act sad when you have good cards; good players look right through this. If you are bluffing and you don't look your opponent right in the eyes they will know you are bluffing.
 Try not to look away not even for a second.
 However try not to do everything just perfect, because you are really predictable then, but that doesn't really make any sense does it?.


Look at your opponents as much a possible in a very serious way.
Make your opponents nervous. Mess with their heads.
Watch how they act and react.
Try to be aware of any poker tells you have and control them.
Consider wearing sunglasses like a pro.

 Here you can find subcategories related to photography, such as:


Camcorders
Camera and Photo Accessories
Digital Cameras
Film Cameras
Lenses and Filters
Video Production and Editing

, You will notice that most of the subcategories offer either equipment for professionals or accessories, but the "Digital Cameras" subcategory has cameras that are also suitable for common consumers (these types of cameras can usually be found at general electronics stores instead of only specialty photography shops). Therefore it is most likely that you will want to continue to buy a camera on eBay by selecting the "Digital Cameras" subcategory.

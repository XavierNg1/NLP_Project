 Sit with your back straight against a chair and your knees at a 90-degree angle. Lift one leg off the ground, extending your leg straight out so that your toes point directly up. Hold that pose for 15 seconds. Place the leg down again and switch legs. Repeat three times on each leg., Place a rolled-up towel or a softball-sized rubber ball beneath your knee. Slowly raise the leg supported by the object. Repeat 12-15 times, then switch to the opposite side., To perform the leg press, simply load the machine to your desired weight, then place your feet in the center of the press pad. Push off the pad by extending your legs. Hold the position for a few seconds, then bring your knees back toward you slowly.Repeat 12-15 times.
You will strengthen your VMO more if you retract your legs further.
For instance, if you retract your legs to a position where your knees touch your chest before pushing off again, you will work your VMO harder than you would by simply retracting your knees to a position where they form a 90-degree angle.
If you are unsure how much weight you can sustain in your leg press, start with a small amount like 20 pounds. Gradually add weight in five-pound increments until youâ€™re at a weight that causes moderate strain.
 You can use a machine or resistance bands to do a thigh extension exercise and work your VMO. Be sure to maintain a soft bend in your knee when doing this exercise.


Whether you are doing a thigh extension with a machine or resistance band, start out with a light weight or light resistance band.
Sit in the seat or chair and place your legs behind the padded weight bar or loop the resistance band through the legs of the chair and around your ankles.
Then, slowly extend your legs outwards, hold for a second and then slowly lower them back down. Repeat the exercise 12 to 15 times and do three sets.

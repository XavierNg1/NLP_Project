 If you do not know what layers are, it is a tool found on many illustrative programs. They can help make outlining and drawing on the computer easier. Set up about 4 layers (you can add more later).
 There are different types of anime eyes, however, they all have a shape to them that makes it identified as anime eyes. Search for anime images so you can get an example of what they look like, and use it as a reference. Use a fairly light color to sketch, as you are probably going to outline it in a dark color, and it will contrast. Your sketch does not have to be neat, just neat enough so you can trace over it.
 Use black to outline your eye, making it as neat as possible. You can choose to use the bezier tool, which would give you clean curves, freehand it, or both.
 If you're using the layers properly, only the sketch will erase, and not the black outline.
 Then, use layer 3 to color in the white part of the eye. Use a slightly blue gray to color the shadow the top eyelid casts down.
 First use a base color, and then use a darker color around the edge and in the shadow; the top right/left,(or wherever the direction the light is coming from, see example). You can choose to blend it in, or not. Then, take a lighter version or the base color and apply it diagonally from the shadow.
 Draw your pupil using a dark color, if you did not include it into your outline. Then, add your glint to the eye by using a very light color close to white where the shadow is. Congrats, you're finished!

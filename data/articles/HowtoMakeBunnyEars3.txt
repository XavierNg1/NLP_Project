 You can make a very simple bunny ears hat with just a paper plate, some pens, and some scissors. First you need to find a paper plate. You might have some of these in the kitchen, but they are easily available in stores.
 When you have your plate, place it upside down on the floor. Starting from the inside edge of the crinkled rim, draw two ears in pen. You should be drawing into the middle part of the plate. The ears should stop about an inch inside the crinkled rim on the opposite side of the plate to where you started drawing.When you are happy with the basic outline, you can decorate or colour them in.
Try drawing a section inside the ears and colouring it pink.
 Now you need to carefully cut around the outside of the ears. Be sure not to cut the part where the base of the ears joins the rim of the plate. Then cut along the inside of the crinkled rim of the plate, so that just the ears are left attached to the rim.Fold up your bunny ears so they are pointing up.
Now slip on your new bunny ears hat.

 Bring a pot of water to boiling using the stove or microwave while you prepare the wax. The water doesn't need to be at a rolling boil, just hot enough to melt the wax. Imagine you were heating up water for a cup of tea that you wanted to drink very soon.









Alternatively, you could heat the jar while you're doing the dishes. Run some water and get it as hot as you can stand, then soak the jar for a while at the bottom of the sink.
 Use an old knife to cut a series of slits into any large chunks of wax that remain in the glass from which you want the wax removed.








Alternately, you can use a fork to separate smaller chunks of wax, or skip this step completely if only a thin coating of wax or residue remains in the glass., The wax should immediately begin to liquefy, and start to float toward the surface of the water.
 Allow the water and wax mixture to cool off for between 15 and 20 minutes. During this time period, the wax will begin to harden slightly on the surface of the water, making it easy to remove.
 If there are any remaining pieces of wax stuck to the glass, use the knife to gently pry them from the glass. They should be soft and pliable, making the job much easier.
 Soak a scrub sponge in hot water and wring out the sponge until it becomes damp. Then use it to clean out the jar, removing stray wax. You could also dampen and use a paper towel in place of a sponge.

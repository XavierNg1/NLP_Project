 Health care providers rely on behavioral symptoms and/or written questionnaires during routine checkups. There are screening tests that can also be done during these visits. If your doctor does not regularly screen for autism, ask for her to do so.;
, There is no one-size-fits-all approach for autism. Tailor treatment to the individual's needs.


For example, one autistic person may have excellent self-care skills and above-average school performance, but need sensory integration therapy and social skills training. Another might be highly social but unable to care for herself and in need of counseling for depression.
 While there is no "cure" for autism, some of its harmful symptoms and comorbid conditions can be helped through medication.


Anxiety
Elevated energy level
Self-injurious behavior
Inability to concentrate
Depression
Seizures
Severe outburst of anger or aggression

,, Many autistic people also experience comorbid disabilities/health conditions, such as anxiety disorders, epilepsy, digestive issues, depression, ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, and more. These are all treatable.

 If you have not started or have only recently begun your undergraduate education, consider pursuing a combined degree. This will allow you to earn your bachelors of science and doctor of pharmacy degree together, usually in six years of study. There are other dual-degree programs that incorporate a different bachelor’s or graduate level degree with a PharmD degree.While a PhD. or other graduate degree can enhance your knowledge and hireability, you must complete a PharmD program to be able to work as a pharmacist in the U.S.;
, This is the most common route to a PharmD degree, as most students are not sure they want to pursue the degree until part way through their undergraduate education. If you want to go straight into a PharmD degree program after undergrad, begin researching programs and preparing to apply during your Junior year.
 If you live outside of the U.S., look to see if your country has a national pharmacist organization, which will likely have information on PharmD programs near you.Be aware that accredited PharmD programs outside of the U.S. are rare. Further, those that do exist also tend to have especially competitive admissions.


While some accredited advanced degree programs outside of the U.S. have less stringent admission criteria, this is not the case for PharmD degrees.
Always ensure a program you’re interested in is accredited by the ACPE, the only organization that can formally accredit an institution as a provider of continuing pharmacy education.

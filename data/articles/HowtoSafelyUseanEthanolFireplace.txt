 If you are hanging your fireplace onto or recessing it into the wall, be sure that the wall is made of non-combustible material, such as stone, brick or wonder board.;
, Be sure that the burner's lid (provided it's adjustable) is completely open to avoid spillage. Replace the cap on the fuel's bottle to preserve any remaining fuel and prevent spillage.
 Any fuel outside of the burner's reservoir may create an uncontained hazard and therefore uncontrollable flame. Once the excess fuel is cleaned, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly prior to ignition.
 Once you've deemed it to be clear, use a long lighter or fireplace match. Place the flame over the burner's opening and the fireplace will ignite. A small, rapid ignition should be expected as combustion occurs.
 If you need to refill the fireplace, you must wait at least 15 minutes prior to adding more fuel. A small, hard-to-see flame may still be present at the bottom which may cause an explosive flame.

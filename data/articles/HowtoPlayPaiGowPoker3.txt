, Both a player's high hand and low hand must beat the banker's corresponding hands for a player to win the bet. If a player wins one hand, but loses the other, neither side wins (a "push"). If the banker wins both hands, the banker wins the bet from the player.


If one of the banker's hands is identical to the player's hand, the player is considered to have a "copy" hand and the banker wins that hand. If both hands are tied, or if the banker wins either the high or low hand and the other is tied, the banker wins the player's bet. If the player wins one hand and ties the other, the game is a push where neither side wins money.

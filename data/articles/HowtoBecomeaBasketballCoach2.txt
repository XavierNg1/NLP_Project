 If you’re just starting out as a coach, you’ll likely want a low-profile position that will allow you to learn on the job. Here are some places where you are most likely to find vacancies:



Local youth facilities, such as the local YMCA or YWCA, are always looking for volunteers to help with leagues of all ages. This is the ideal place to start your coaching career if you’re looking for something basic.

Recreation centers work the same way, only with openings for adult leagues. While most leagues advertise for player openings, you could try inquiring about the opportunity to test out your coaching abilities for a rec team.

House leagues or summer leagues are usually more laid-back than other leagues, and are a perfect spot for someone looking for a gig that will kickstart a coaching career. These leagues offer a wide range of ages and skill levels to choose from.

High schools occasionally have coaching vacancies, but they are usually reserved for people with experience in the field. Unless you have a strong playing background to fall back on, it may be difficult to secure a coaching job at this level.
 Before being able to commit to any gig, you should find out if it fits in your personal schedule. Unless it’s a paying job—and most assignments will not be—you’ll need to balance work and family time with your commitment to coaching. Get a handle on how often and when you’ll be expected to coach, and factor in additional time for practices if they’re required.
 Once you’ve narrowed down the list of openings, you should select the one that best fits what you hope to achieve. There will likely be paperwork (personal info, waivers, and other information) involved in finalizing a position, so make sure you fill everything in to the best of your ability.
 If nothing comes up right away, be patient. Read newspapers and check postings at recreation centers regularly. Keep yourself plugged into the coaching pipeline in case another coach learns of an opening.

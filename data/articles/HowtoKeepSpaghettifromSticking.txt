 A pasta pot that is seven quarts (6.6l) or larger will allow you to cook a pound of pasta. Cooking with more than enough water also prevents clumping, sticky pasta.;
, Surplus water will also allow the pasta to return to boiling quickly after you add your dry pasta.


Using a lot of water is extremely important when cooking long pasta, like spaghetti or fettuccini. The long pasta needs room to move around the pot without sticking to the sides.
 Salted water will flavor the pasta.
 As the oil coats the spaghetti, it prevents the pasta sauce from sticking to the outside surface. Your pasta will be more likely to stick together., Use a timer, so that you don’t over or undercook your pasta.
, It should be firm to the bite, also called “al dente.”, When you cook pasta, it releases starch into the water. To stop it from sticking, you need to get rid of that starchy water right away.
 It will make it clump together; starch dries on the pasta and makes it sticky.
 Instead of sticking together, the pasta sauce will adhere to the pasta.The result should be a velvety, smooth pasta dish.

 Add 1 ripe avocado that’s been seeded and peeled, ½ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of garlic powder, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of pepper, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of lime juice, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of fresh cilantro, ¼ cup (58 g) of mayonnaise, and ¼ cup (71 g) of plain Greek yogurt to a large bowl. Mix the ingredients well with a fork until they are fully combined.You can add vegetables, such as chopped onion or celery, if you’d like.
 Once all of the other ingredients are mixed, add 2 cups (280 g) of shredded chicken to the bowl. Stir the mixture well until it’s completely incorporated.You can use leftover chicken or purchase a rotisserie chicken and shred the meat from it.
 After the salad is completely mixed, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Place it the refrigerator and allow it to chill for at least 20 to 30 minutes so the flavors have time to meld together.For the best flavor, it’s best not to chill the salad for more than 24 hours.
 Once the avocado chicken salad has been chilled for a while, use it as a filling for your favorite sandwich bread or pita pocket. You can also serve it with crackers or on a bed of lettuce.

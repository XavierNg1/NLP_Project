 Fill it with all sorts of daring, sexy clothes. Make sure you still look appropriate to the occasion. Show as much skin (and little skin) as you feel comfortable with. For example, if you think you're showing too much or too little cleavage change your top.
 Wear bronzer, dark brown eyeliner, mascara, and clear lip gloss. MAJOR TIP: A blond hair person should wear brown mascara instead of black. It would look more natural.
 Just remember the two secrets to sexy hair: texture and body. Use a hair texturizing cream or a salt spray for texture, and add tons of mousse for more body. Make sure you learn the techniques the salon uses, so you can replicate your new style at home.

 Everyone grieves at a different pace, so don’t force yourself to get over the loss of a friend too quickly. Let yourself have the time you need to go through the process of grief. Don’t ignore the things you need to feel to let yourself heal.Sometimes, you might need to be on your own. Give yourself that luxury, but don’t isolate yourself too much. Make sure you still reach out to others and find strength and support in friends and family.
 When someone you love dies, it’s natural to feel as if there was a lot you wanted to say that you didn’t get a chance to say. Write these things down. The act of writing out your thoughts and feelings for your friend can be a healing experience. Tell your lost friend exactly what you want them to know.You can keep this letter, or you can leave it at their gravesite. Or, you can simply throw it away. Whatever is going to offer you the most closure is what you should do.
 When you lose someone close to you, you might feel very alone, or like you lost the person you usually turned to when you felt sad or depressed. Join a local support group to find people you can share your feelings with who are going through similar experiences.

A support group offers a group of people who are going through or have been through similar things. These people will be able to empathize and understand what you’re going through, as well as offer support and advice. Support groups are safe spaces, so what you say there will stay there.
 In the wake of a tragedy, you might find yourself focusing only on the loss itself. Try and refocus your energy onto the positive memories you have of your friend. Think about the good times you had, and the way they positively impacted your life.


Try making something tangible to display these memories. Put together a photo collage, or write about these experiences in a journal. Revisit it when you need a reminder, or put it in a visible place.

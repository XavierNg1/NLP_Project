 You will need a spoon, a carving knife, a paring knife, a cutting board, and a freshly washed ripe watermelon. Choose a watermelon that’s firm to the touch. The skin should be smooth and unbroken.

If possible, select a seedless variety. Seedless watermelons are easier to serve., First, peel the green skin off of the sides and top of watermelon with a paring knife. Next, remove the top third of the watermelon and discard it. If your watermelon bowl is unstable, cut a small level spot on bottom so that the melon sits flat.Be careful when peeling the watermelon. You only want to peel away the very top green layer.
 Use your carving knife to create a petal. Insert the knife into the watermelon at a forty-five degree angle and create a small, curved slice. Next, create a second slice about a centimeter behind the first slice. The second slice will carve out a small sliver of watermelon.

If the sliver of watermelon doesn’t slide out easily, gently scoop it out with the spoon.
 Continue to carve the petals of your flower, starting at the center and moving outward.Work in a spiral formation, carving smaller petals near the center and larger petals near the edge., Use the spoon to remove the watermelon flesh and set it aside. Be careful not to disturb your flower carving, especially if you carved too deeply when making petals. Use the watermelon flesh in a fruit salad or discard it.

 Instruct the subject to lie flat on his or her back with both legs straight. Position the pin of the goniometer over the hip joint and to the outside of the leg.


Both arms of the goniometer should be closed and pointing straight down over the leg line.
 Instruct the subject to lift the leg up while keeping the knee straight. He or she should continue lifting the leg up and toward the body until it can go no further without causing pain.


At the point of full extension, extend the movable goniometer arm out to match the position of the subject's leg. The stationary arm and pin should remain in the same position.
Read the rotation degree on the center dial of the goniometer. Look directly beneath the center line of the movable arm to find the correct value.

The average for this measurement is approximately 100 degrees, but the full range runs between 0 and 135 degrees.
 Instruct the subject to turn and lie flat on his or her stomach. Both legs should point straight out.


Position the goniometer over the hip joint in the same manner as before. The pin should rest over the joint at the outer leg, and both arms should be closed and pointing straight across the leg line.
In some instances, it might be easier for the subject to lie flat on his or her stomach over a bench or similar structure. Everything from the hips up should rest on the bench, but the legs should extend straight out with no support.
 Instruct the subject to lift the leg straight back and up, continuing as far as possible in this direction without causing any pain.


Keep the stationary arm and pin located in the same position, but raise the movable goniometer arm to match the position of the leg.
Read the rotation angle located directly beneath the center line of the center dial on the instrument. This value indicates the hypertension flexibility of the hip.

The full range exists between 0 and 45 degrees, with 20 degrees being about average.

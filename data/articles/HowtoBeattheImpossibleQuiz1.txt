 If you see a bomb, the question has a time limit. If you don't, you can take as long as you like to answer the question. Stop and make sure you're confident in your answer before continuing, especially if you're a long ways into the game. You don't want to have to start again from the beginning because you tried to save a few seconds.;
, The answers are often illogical, making puns, jokes, or pop culture references instead of answering the question seriously. Some of them are even intentionally misspelled words to make bad jokes ("armies" instead of "arms").
 Read the question word by word. Is there an obvious meaning – so obvious you hadn't thought of it? For example, if you're told to "Click the answer," literally click the words "the answer."


A supposed typo or misspelling might actually be a hint.
 The more people working together, the more likely you'll get the answer. Friends who know internet memes and pop culture references are especially helpful, since some of the questions are references to movies, songs, or memes that the game developer thought were funny back in 2006 and 2007.
 If you have to guess, write down the answer you're going to guess before you click it. Cross it out if it was wrong, and circle it if you were right. If you lose all your lives and have to restart the game (and it's a miracle if this doesn't happen), you'll be glad you wrote down your last guess so you have fewer options to choose from next time.

 Before you can find someone who will meet your needs, you need to get to know yourself really well. Take some time to do a personal inventory of your core values and figure out what your emotional needs are. Write them down so that you can consult your list as you search for your future partner.Some good questions to consider include:


What is most important to you? Family? Career? A hobby? Your friends? Honesty? Loyalty? Or something else? List your values and then rank them in order of their importance.
What do you want from a partner? Understanding? A sense of humor? Kindness? Strength? Encouragement? List the things that you want your future partner to provide in order of importance to you.
 Before you go out looking for someone who you would like to fall in love with you, think about what you really want in a partner. Make a list of all of the qualities that you would like your future partner to possess before you embark on your love quest.


What traits do you want your future partner to have? Do you want someone who likes to read? Enjoys cooking? Is close to his/her family? Has a sense of humor? Treats you like a queen/king?

, People are more likely to fall in love with people who share their interests, so consider looking for someone at a club that you belong to or through some other group that you participate in. While you may be attracted to someone physically, it may not be a love match if you have nothing in common with the person.


For example, if you volunteer at the local hospital, try getting to know your fellow volunteers. If you love to work out, try talking to people who frequent your local gym.
You might also consider an online dating site. These sites can match you with people who share your interests, which may make it easier for you to connect with the person on your first date.

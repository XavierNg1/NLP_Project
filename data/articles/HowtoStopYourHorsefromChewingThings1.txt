 Your horse is likely to chew or crib (grab objects and suck air through them) if he is kept in a stall. This is especially true if you have an energetic horse that is stalled for several days at a time without much to watch or little social interaction. You may also notice a bored horse:Weave or pace
Kick the sides of the stalls
Show separation anxiety
Toss his head
Become aggressive;
, Make sure your horse can spend time in open space, such as a pasture or paddock. This also means you should give him space to wander freely on his own, exploring new pasture. Your horse should have enough room to canter or gallop, roll around, and generally burn off energy, as the mood takes him.Be aware that even being turned out in a small paddock is still boring for some horses. A cramped paddock, or one shared with other horses which limits mobility, can frustrate your horse leading to fence chewing.
 Ideally, you should turn your horse out onto a large area of land all the time. If you can't do this, make sure to ride your horse daily. This will give physical and mental stimulation that can distract him from chewing habits. Try to switch up the types of exercise your horse gets. For example, take him on a trail ride, do lunging exercises, ride with other horses, or work in a round pen.Make your horse work for his food. To do this, use a hay feeder which will slow him down by slowing the release of hay through a narrow slot. This will stimulate your horse mentally, occupy him, and make him spend more time eating., Fortunately, there are lots of ways to entertain and enrich your horse's life. You can try training your horse to do new things, like touching targets on cue, jumping, or dressage. Or, offer toys to amuse your horse. Your horse might like playing with rubber tires, ropes, or balls, especially if he has to stay in his stall for a while.Even just spending time with horse can stimulate his mind. Give him a gentle massage and talk to him.

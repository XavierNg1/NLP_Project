 You will need a few different shades of eye shadow, some brushes, and a cup of water. You will need both a dark gray eye shadow, as well as either a deep blue or purple. Olive green and yellow or gold are optional for added detail.
 Blot your brush to create uneven edges that are already partially blended. Use only a sparse amount of pigment. If you are finding you must cake on this base to get it appropriately dark, use a different slightly darker eye shadow to begin with instead., Use your fingertips. Concentrate the shadows where your bruise's imaginary impact point may be. This will be the darkest part of your bruise., Use your fingers to add just a touch of these colors to the periphery of your bruise. Finish up by blending everything with a fresh brush.

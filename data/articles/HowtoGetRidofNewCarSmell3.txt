 Since the new car scent is caused in part by the new plastic of the interior of the car, cleaning and wiping interior plastic surfaces can help to remove the odor. Use a gentle cleanser and a microfiber cloth to clean any plastic interior surfaces such as the door or the steering wheel. After using the cleanser, wipe surfaces with a damp cloth to make sure the cleanser is completely removed from the plastic and doesnâ€™t leave streaks., Another way to clean away the new car smell smell is to get your seats and carpet shampooed at a detailing shop. Seats and carpeting are often made of absorbent material, which may absorb and trap the new car odor. Even though detailing is usually done to remove dirt and dust, it can work to remove bad odors as well.You can also do this yourself by buying products made specifically for the materials in your car interior and following the instructions on the label.
Getting this procedure done is effective but can be quite expensive, so you may want to try other methods and use this as a last resort.
 An alternative to shampooing your car seats is to steam clean them. Steam cleaners shoot steam deep into upholstery to break down and eliminate bad scents. You can buy or rent steam cleaners in many home improvement stores, but be careful to follow the instructions on the label as steam can burn if used improperly.

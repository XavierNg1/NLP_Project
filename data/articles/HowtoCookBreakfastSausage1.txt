 Place a medium nonstick skillet on the stove over medium-low heat. Let it warm up for 1 or 2 minutes.


Note that you should not add any extra oil or fat to the pan. The fat inside the sausage should render as it cooks, providing all the grease needed for the frying process.
If you can check the temperature of the skillet, note that the temperature should reach 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) before you continue.;
, Arrange the sausage links or patties in the hot skillet. Keep the sausage in a single layer.


You can cook both links and patties using this method. The cooking times vary slightly, but otherwise, the process remains the same.
You can also cook breakfast roll sausage using this method if you slice the sausage roll into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) patties beforehand.Treat these patties as you would treat pre-formed breakfast patties.
 Cook sausage links for 12 to 16 minutes;cook sausage patties for 10 to 12 minutes.Regardless of which form you choose, you'll need to turn the sausage frequently as it cooks to promote even browning on all sides.
Add an additional 2 minutes if you use frozen breakfast sausage instead of thawed sausage.
The sausages should be browned all the way through, and the internal temperature should read a minimum of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius).
 Remove the sausage from the hot skillet and transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels. Drain off the excess grease for 1 or 2 minutes, then serve the sausage while it's still hot.


Store leftover sausages in the refrigerator for 1 or 2 days. You can also freeze the leftovers for up to 30 days.

 Your horse should be haltered and tied before attempting to put the bridle on. Keep them tied fairly short on the lead. If the lead is too loose, they may have room to avoid you. However, you don't want to tie the horse so that it can't move at all. For many horses, this will increase their hatred of the bridling process. You want the lead just loose enough that they can't lift their head out of your reach.;
, If your horse keeps throwing its head, you can keep it still by resting your hand on its head. Hold the bridle in your left hand, and reach over the horse's head with your right so that your hand is sticking between its ears. If the horse tries to move its head, gently press down on the top of their mane to encourage them to bend their head towards you., Hand the top of the bridle to your right hand, and take the bit in your left hand, resting it against your flat fingers. Use your right hand only to hold the bridle's weight. Gently press the bit against their lips., If the horse doesn't take the bit, then you can encourage them to open their mouth. Keep the bit resting against your flat fingers on your left hand, and slip your thumb into the upper corner of their mouth. Rub the gums until they open their mouth. Gently slip the bit in their mouth. Keep gentle pressure against the teeth, but be sure not to knock the bit against their teeth. This is painful to the horse, and it will make it more difficult for you to bridle them.You may want to practice putting your thumb in without the bit first.
Make sure that you are reaching in the side of the mouth where there are no teeth.This will prevent biting and injury.

 Much of the dirt and grime on your guitar strings comes from your hands. You can keep them in their best condition by making sure your hands are clean before you play your guitar.Use hand sanitizer right before you play, which will kill any bacteria on your hands as well as get rid of oils on your hands which can damage your strings and your guitar over time.
 Even if you took care to keep your hands clean, your strings still will get dirty as you play your guitar. Wiping them down with a dry, soft cloth will keep them in their best condition.Use a small cloth such as a dish towel of a cotton diaper. You can wrap the cloth gently around the string and clean all sides.
 If you haven't been wiping down your strings regularly, or if they have a lot of gunk on them, you can purchase a string cleaner and lubricant at your local guitar store or music shop.String cleaners aren't strictly necessary. If you wipe down your strings every time you play your guitar, you should be fine. Never use commercial all-purpose cleaners on guitar strings.
If your strings have significant buildup and cleaning them doesn't seem to make much of a difference, you may be better off simply replacing them.
 Strings build up dust and residue over time. How often you need to change your strings depends to some extent on how often you play your guitar. Regardless, you should be changing them at least once every couple of months.Don't take all your strings off at once â€“ you can cause your guitar to loose tension, resulting in a bent neck that will seriously affect your guitar's sound. Instead, remove and replace the lowest two strings, then move to the next pair.
When you replace the strings, take the time to clean the frets and oil the fretboard if necessary while the strings are off your guitar.

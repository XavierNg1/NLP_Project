 In order to upload videos to YouTube, you will need to create a Google account. Creating a Google account is free, and if you already use Gmail or Google Drive, you already have an account.;
, Your YouTube account is defined as a "Channel". This is your hub for all of the content you upload and comments you make when you are logged into YouTube. By default, your channel will have the same name as your Google account. If you want to use a different name on YouTube, you will need to create a new Channel.


You can have multiple Channels on one Google account.
Each Channel will also get a corresponding Google+ page.
To create a new Channel, click your account name in the upper-right corner and then click the "All my channels" link. This will open a page showing all of your linked Channels. Click the "Create a new channel" button to create a new Channel. You will be asked to enter a name for your new channel as well as choose a category.
Choose a channel name that relates to your content. This will help make your channel more recognizable and more authoritative.
 What you need will vary depending on what you are planning on making. Are you going for a TV-like feel with your video? You'll need a decent camcorder and some editing software. Are you just filming yourself? You can probably get by with just a webcam. If you're uploading animation, then you just need your animation tools, no camera required.

Municipal court records are maintained by those individual courts and are not available using any state-run database or the Wisconsin State Law Library., Each municipal court has its own website, which will have contact information for the clerk's office as well as additional information for how to get court records.

Check the court's website to learn exactly where you need to send your request.You may not be able to view the records without staff supervision, or make copies on your own. You will be charged a fee per page for any copies made of records. For example, the Milwaukee Municipal Court charges $0.25 per page for copies., The time it takes to fulfill your records request will depend on the size of the city and the volume of requests the court has to fill.


For example, the Milwaukee Municipal Court indicates that it tries to fulfill record requests within two hours, but if a request is going to take longer it will let you know the date and time your records will be available.

 In APA style, you use the author’s last name, the date, and the page number in the in-text citation.
 Usually, you place the citation at the end of the sentence. Keep in mind that commas go in between each piece of information. For example:


“Ice water can be used effectively to show how evaporation works (Hess, 1992, p. 24). Therefore, I used it in my experiment.”

, You can also use the name at the beginning of the sentence without parenthesis. However, unlike MLA, you also put the other information in parenthesis at the beginning of the sentence. For example:


“As Hess (1992, p.24) states, ‘I like ice water’ (33).”

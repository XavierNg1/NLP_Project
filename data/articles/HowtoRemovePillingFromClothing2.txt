 A sweater comb is a small, fine toothed comb made specifically for removing pilling. It is different from a hair comb because the teeth are smaller and closer together. Pull the fabric taut and scrape the affected area gently. Be careful not to damage the fabric.
 An electric pill remover is more expensive than other tools, but the fastest, most effective method. Insert batteries and lay the garment on a flat surface. Apply to the garment in small, circular motions. Start with the lightest contact possible and increase as needed. Continue until the pills disappear. They will accumulate in the shaver's barrel, which you can empty as it fills up.
 A sweater stone is made especially for removing sweater pills. To use, lay the garment on a flat surface and pull flat. Gently rub the stone against the affected area. Drag it across the fabric and pull of the extra pills as they accumulate, using tape or your fingers.

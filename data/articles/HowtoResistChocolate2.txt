 You probably know not to shop when you’re hungry. You also shouldn’t shop when you’re depressed or stressed. Your ability to resist comfort food like chocolate will be lower when you’re emotional.


If you have to go to the grocery store when you think you might not be to resist the chocolate-buying urge, avoid the candy aisle and the bakery.
 You might have a family that isn’t willing to give up chocolate, or you may need it in your house for another reason. When you can’t get rid of it, make it easier to eat something else instead. Don’t keep chocolate accessible. If you need to have it nearby, hide it away, freeze it, or do whatever makes it more of an effort for you to get to it. The harder you have to work, the more you’ll consider if you need it.
 Sometimes mint can help you get over the urge for chocolate. Chewing can also make you feel like you’re eating something.
 It’s hard to get support from friends and family if they don’t know what’s going on. Let them help you instead of damage your resolve. It may take some reminders to get them to remember that you’re avoiding it, but once they catch on, they should support you.


You might say that you’ve decided to stop eating chocolate, and give them the reason why. “I’m giving up chocolate to help with my weight loss” or “to reduce the sugar I eat” or even “because it’s Lent.”

 Click the start button, then open control panel. Find the section titled "Security." If your Windows Firewall is listed as off, click the "on" radial and save your settings.
 To the left of the screen should be a menu, click on the advanced settings button. Under "exceptions" find Port 21. It will be listed as open. Remove the exception and restart your computer. When your computer reboots, run your port scanning software again and confirm that port 21 has been closed.

 You have been taking your child to him for years and both of you know and trust his opinion. He has a direct line to the experts in the field, and can recommend a child therapist that he not only trusts, but feels will be a good match for your child.;
, Once you have a few referrals from your pediatrician, it's a good idea to call your health insurance company to find out which of those referrals are covered under your plan. You don't know how long your child will need therapy, and it can get expensive if you are not helped by insurance.
 When making your phone calls, ask the child therapist if you can meet with her first before committing to bringing your child in for regular visits. If the therapist says no or claims to be too busy, then it's a good sign that she isn't the right fit.
 First, ask the therapist if he is licensed, then make a telephone call to the proper board to be sure. If you choose to go to this therapist, look for the license hanging on his wall.
 Since you have gotten referrals, you are assuming that the therapist specializes in children and adolescents. Before making your final decision, ask all of them how long they have been a child therapist, and choose one with a good amount of experience working with kids.
 You may not want to think about it, but in the event of an emergency, it's important to find out how the child therapist can be reached. In addition, ask her if there will be someone to cover when she is not in her office, such as during vacation periods or illnesses.

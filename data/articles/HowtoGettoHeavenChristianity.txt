 Have you ever lied, stolen, lusted, coveted, or been angry with someone unjustly? If you've lied, then you're a liar. If you've stolen, then you are a thief. You've broken the Law of God. God has said, "You shall not steal; You shall not lie; You shall have no other gods before Me; You shall not murder, etc." (Exodus 20:1-17). He has given the standard of righteousness; and if you have broken any of God's commandments, then you have fallen short of that standard and are under the inevitable judgment of God (1 John 3:4; Isaiah 59:2; Rom. 6:23). When you die, you will face Him; and on the Day of Judgment, he will deliver the proper judgment to all people. He must because he is righteous and holy. Here is the the salvation plan!;
, 15:1-4). His death was a sacrifice that turns away the wrath of God (1 John 2:2). His grace is the only way to be saved from God's righteous judgment upon those who have sinned (for all have sinned) by breaking his Law.
 You need his grace alone. Your works won't help you (Rom. 3:10-12; Isaiah 64:6), nor will your sincerity. You can never be good enough, and you have nothing to offer God except your sinfulness. It is only by the love and grace of God found in Jesus and His sacrifice that you can be delivered from the righteous wrath of God upon all who have broken His law. Jesus saves you from God's righteous judgment.


The Bible says that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23). That means that your sins have caused a separation between you and God (Isaiah 59:2), and the result is death (Rom. 6:23) and wrath (Eph. 2:3).
 "It is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are Godâ€™s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance as our way of life.", (Ephesians 2:8-10). You must trust in what Jesus did on the cross to forgive you of your sins and not trust anything else--not even your own sincerity or works., He is the only way to God the Father (John 14:6). He alone reveals God (Matt. 11:27). He has all authority in heaven and earth (Matt. 28:18). It is only through Him that you can be saved from God's wrath (Eph. 2:3). He can forgive you of your sin (Luke 5:20; Matt. 9:1-8). He can remove the guilt that is upon your soul. Jesus can set you free from the bondage of sin that blinds your eyes, weakens your soul, and brings you to despair. He can do this because He bore sin in His body on the cross (1 Peter. 2:24) so that those who trust in Him would be saved.
 Come to the One who died for sinners (Matt. 11:28). Believe and trust in Jesus. Receive Jesus, who is God in flesh (John 1:1, 14) and who died and rose from the dead (1 Cor. 15:1-4), as your Lord and Savior.
 9:1-8). Receive Christ (John 1:12) and the sacrifice he made on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24). Repent of your sins. This means to change your mind about sin and agree with God that it is an offence to Him and is separating you from His fellowship. Only He can wash you clean from your sins, and only Jesus can deliver you from the future judgment of a holy and infinite God. Pray to Jesus. Seek Him. Ask Him to save you. Put your trust in him. At this point, you are saved and God has forgiven you of your sins forever.

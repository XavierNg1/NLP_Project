 If you’re nervous about pruning, don’t worry—spireas can cope with a good pruning and it’s hard to be too brutal with them. A spirea will grow back from the most severe pruning.


Newly planted shrubs won’t need pruning as much; you may just give them a bit of a trim to reshape them in their first year.
 Try to cut each stem back so that it has around five buds on it. Use sharp gardening or pruning shears to do this. Remove all dead, diseased or decaying growth as well. At the same time, remove any weak-looking growth or stems that seem too spindly.


Any spindly or weak, dead, diseased or damaged stems should be cut right back to the base of the stem.
 To stop the bush from becoming too dense, thin out some branches in the middle of the plant to remove the congestion. This means cutting out some of the branches that are making your bush too thick.
 You may also like to remove any suckers, the shoots growing out of the plant’s rootstock, when you prune. This prevents the plant spreading via suckering. To do this:


Remove the sucker by getting as close as possible to the base of the root. Scrape away some soil around the root if necessary. Try to tear off the sucker, rather than cutting it away., If your spirea is old, dense and woody then you can renew it with a vigorous pruning. One third of all the woody old trunks should be pruned right back to ground level. If you do this for three years in a row, the plant will be reinvigorated with good, fresh growth.
 After pruning, give the plant a water, fertilize it and renew the mulch. A slow release fertilizer is best. A fertilizer of blood, fish and bone is a good-value option, though you can also purchase commercial fertilizers. Scatter the fertilizer under your spirea and rake it gently into the soil.


You should also add around two inches of compost, leaf mold or well-rotted manure around your spirea to act as a mulch.

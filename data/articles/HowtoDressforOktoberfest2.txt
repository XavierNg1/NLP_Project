 Lederhosen are a type of traditional leather breeches, but authentic lederhosen can be quite expensive. If you cannot find the real thing, mimic the look by selecting a pair of brown, black, or dark green knee-length pants. Dockers-style works best, and the pants should not have many pockets.
 Authentic lederhosen may come with suspenders, but if you buy them separately, try to find some that match the color of your breeches.
 The socks should be slouch socks, a type of cotton sock that reaches up to the knee.


While many men wear the socks pulled up to the knee, some prefer to push down knee-length socks so that they only extend up a few inches above the ankle.
Typically, men whose lederhosen stop just above their knee wear their socks pulled up, while men whose lederhosen extend just below their knee wear their socks pushed down.
 If you cannot find authentic footwear, pick out a pair of black or dark brown leather loafers.
 This is a specific style of felt hat. It has a peaked top and wide brim. A band is usually wrapped around the base of the hat, and a feather is attached to it with thread. This is an optional accessory, however.

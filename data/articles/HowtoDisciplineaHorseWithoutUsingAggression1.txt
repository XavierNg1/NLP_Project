 When your horse participates in unwanted behavior, it is important to react within 2-3 seconds. Horses are only aware of immediate, in-the-moment reactions, so disciplining your horse at a later time will not help the horse understand that its behavior was unwelcome., Using the pressure and release method describes the methodical application of pressure to promote obedient behavior and is a nonaggressive way to correct your horse. Pressure must be applied with purpose and with a specific outcome in mind, and the key is knowing when to release the pressure. You should release immediately when the horse tries to correct its behavior. The horse will see this as a reward for listening to your command.


While in the saddle, you can apply pressure with your legs. If your horse does not want to stop, move your legs slightly behind where they usually rest and apply soft pressure with both knees to stop your horse.If a horse does not want to go left down a path, apply pressure with your right leg. Horses will move away from the side where the pressure is felt. In this case, the horse will begin to veer toward the left path.A horse should respond calmly when the release method is used correctly. With time, the horse will become more responsive and willing to listen to your commands., Use your body language and stance to let the horse know its behavior is unacceptable. Stand squarely in front of the horse and look it in the eye.This will assert that you are alpha, the horse’s leader. Remain calm so that the horse will respond to your behavior in a positive manner.
 When your horse needs to be disciplined, remain calm, and say a simple, but firm, “No.” Do not shout at the horse.Use this command consistently, and the horse will begin to understand that this means it needs to behave.
 Place your hand on the horse’s chest and calmly ask it to move back. Horses do not like walking backward, and using motion to gain control of your horse is a nonthreatening form of discipline.

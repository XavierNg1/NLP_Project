 Once you have made either your low-calorie or vegan dough, it’s time to shape the cookies. Begin by spreading a thin layer of flour over a clean counter or cutting board. Then place the dough on top of the floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough until the sheet of dough is about ¼ inch thick (0.6 cm.)If you are making the gluten-free cookies, use almond flour to flour your surface.
You need to roll your dough if you are using cookie cutters to cut out your sugar cookies. If you are just making round sugar cookies, don’t roll out the dough. Instead, roll the dough into small balls with a diameter of about 1 inch (2.54 cm.)

, After you have rolled out your dough, use cookie cutters to cut out your sugar cookies. Then place the cut-outs on the baking sheet, separated by about 1 inch (2.54 cm) of space. If you have scraps left over, form them into a ball, roll them out, and cut out more cookies.If you are not using cookie cutters, place the balls of dough that you made on the greased baking sheet. Then dip the bottom of a regular drinking glass in flour or sugar and press on each ball to flatten it to about ¼ inch (0.6 cm) in thickness.
 Place the pan of cookies in the preheated oven and bake them for 7-10 minutes. The low-calorie sugar cookies will likely need the full ten minutes, whereas the gluten-free cookies may only need 7 or 8. Keep an eye on the cookies and take them out of the oven when they are golden-brown., After you take the cookies out of the oven, remove them from the pan using a spatula and place them on a cooling rack. If you don’t have a cooling rack, place them on a plate or clean counter. After about ten minutes of cooling, serve and enjoy your sugar cookies!

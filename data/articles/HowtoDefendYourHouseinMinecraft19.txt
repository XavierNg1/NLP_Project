 As if these weren't strong enough building resources they can now protect you from this., Keep in mind it's only like half a heart so you'll need a large army of these to hold of the Ender Dragon.,,, Like atleast 4 times out of 10 the Ender Dragon is gonna hit you if you go on the offensive and she can deal a lot of damage., The Ender Dragon doesn't exactly chase you so if you run out of the way you won't get hit., This stops them from getting broken down by the Ender Dragons hit. You may have to manually control this so make sure you're either always got someone on watch or build many levers controlling the same system. Be careful if you have one outside though because it might be used to trap you in., If your close enough you might be able to fly to help if you came with other people.

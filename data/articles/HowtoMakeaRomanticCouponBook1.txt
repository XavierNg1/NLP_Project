 One of the easiest ways to make a romantic coupon book is finding a printable template online that you can customize with your own text. There are all sorts of options, most of which include a cover template for the coupon book and specific directions about how to cut and bind the coupons.Note that different templates print coupons in different sizes.
Some coupons will be the size of a matchbox, others the size of a smart phone, and some the size of a check.;
, If all of the templates online are a bit too basic for your taste, you can always make your own. Making and printing a template on a computer can save time. You can then easily fill each coupon out with it’s own text, either on the computer or by hand. Look at templates available online for ideas.Many different applications can be used to make a simple template. For instance, Google Docs and other words processors can do the job. Many of these are also freely available.
While the design is entirely up to you, decide on a standard shape, and be sure to include things like, “Coupon: _________________”, “Expiration Date:_____________” and “Validated by: ___________.”

, Coupons that are printed on a sheet of colored or patterned paper may look especially good. More importantly, however, use a sheet of paper that is a bit thicker than regular paper, such as cardstock or paper meant for formal correspondence. Thicker paper will hold up much better, even in your partner's wallet or purse.


You can get thick paper from an office supply store or online.
Make sure your printer can handle whatever sort of paper you’re hoping to print on, or have the coupons printed at a print store.
 Entirely handmade coupons can be especially romantic, as they have an extra element of personalized human touch. Use construction paper or something even thicker, and start by cutting out as many coupons as you’ll need in the same shape. After writing and otherwise decorating each one, fasten them together however you wish.


Perhaps the easiest way to fasten the coupons is by stapling them all together at one end. You can glue something over or around the staples to obscure them.
Another option is using scissors with patterns teeth to cut the ends of each coupon and make them look like big carnival tickets. Then they can simply be tied or rubber-banded all together.

 Though culture shock can be stressful, work to find the beauty in your surroundings daily. Make a list of all of the good things about your environment as well as any fun experiences that you have had. You have likely had a lot more fun than you might realize, but documenting that on paper can make it feel more real to you.For instance, perhaps the city you are in is gorgeous. You might also have met a really nice friend while you have been there.
 Another way to find and create more positivity with your experience is to make some local friends. Go out at night and meet new people. Go to a festival or event and make some connections there. Local friends can be instrumental in helping you navigate the area, find the coolest spots, and have the best time where you are., Though you should certainly try to learn more about the culture that you are in, you can also teach others about your own culture. This will help you feel more productive and valued as well as connected to home.Perhaps you want to cook your familyâ€™s favorite meal for your new friends.
 Times might be tough, but never forget to laugh despite it all. Spend time with friends laughing and joking, call your funny friends, get on social media, or watch a funny show or movie., It is also critical that you take care of yourself during this time. Eat well, exercise, keep your space neat, and keep up your own personal hygiene. Take some time for yourself each day to relax and decompress.

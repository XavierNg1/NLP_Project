 Hair is one of the first thing guys notice and it has been shown that they are attracted to healthy-looking hair. If your hair is color-treated or damaged, try soaking it in coconut oil overnight and washing it out the next morning. It’s a great way to treat dry, damaged hair. If your hair is healthy, avoid over-processing it with too many dyes or chemicals, which can lead to damage and breakage., You may want to avoid smelling like body odor in front of your crush, which could give him a negative impression of you. You don't have to be flowery, clean, and fresh all the time, just try to shower daily, wear deodorant and possibly put on some nice perfume or cologne to try to impress him. Smelling nice or at least presentable, is actually pretty attractive.
 Don't feel pressured to dress just like everyone else and don't concern yourself with whether you’re wearing the brand name that's popular. If you feel comfortable, you will protect your best self and people will feel comfortable around you. Also, if a guy is truly into you, he won't care about the small flaws in your appearance that you might see every time you look in the mirror.

 You may already have one growing in your yard or you might have to purchase one. Choose an aloe plant with mature leaves growing near the base of the plant. If there are no leaves growing at the root of the plant, then it is not ready for harvesting.


Aloe vera plants are inexpensive and don't require much care. They are a type of succulent, which need lots of light, but little water. Aloe vera plants can last for years if well cared for.
 Choose healthy green leaves near the base of the plant and cut at an angle.Make sure to cut large leaves so you can eventually make cubes that are big enough to handle. Small leaves will be difficult to handle and are probably not ready to harvest.
 Use a vegetable peeler to thinly slice away the peel and expose the gel.
 Make the cubes about 2 inches (5.1Â cm) long, so that you can easily handle them once they're frozen.
 Once the cubes are completely hard, you can remove them to a bag for longer storage.

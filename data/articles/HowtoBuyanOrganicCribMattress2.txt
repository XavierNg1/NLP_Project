 Most baby mattresses have a vinyl waterproof covering. Polyvinyl chloride (or PVC) is a non-organic and environmentally-unfriendly plastic. PVC is also toxic and a known carcinogen. When babies breathe in and absorb PVC through their skin, they are at a higher-risk for asthma, kidney disease, and liver dysfunction. Opt for a non-vinyl covering instead.Food-grade polyethylene plastic is a common organic and non-toxic covering alternative., Most crib mattresses use polyurethane foam as a mattress filling, which is highly-flammable and non-organic. Along with its main component (petroleum), polyurethane foam can contain additives like formaldehyde, benzene, toluene, and other toxic chemicals. Opt for a crib mattress filled with wool batting, cotton, plant foam, or coconut coir., Organic cotton is the ideal material for crib mattresses because it is non-toxic and breathable. Unlike foam mattresses, organic cotton does not release toxic fumes. Organic cotton is also sturdy and firm, which protects babies against suffocation.Organic cotton is not waterproof. Buy a non-toxic waterproof covering to protect the mattress from leaking diapers or bottles.
 Organic does not equate to non-toxic. Even organic crib mattresses can contain dangerous materials for your baby. Safety is most important for your baby, so check to see if the label has both certifications. If you're not sure what materials are used, check with the manufacturer for more details., Wool and latex are both known to cause eczema in children. If you find a wool crib mattress, look for wool that has not been treated with chemicals. Wool from sheep fed a natural diet is also less likely to irritate skin. Avoid synthetic latex completely.Natural rubber latex (which comes from rubber trees) is an organic alternative, but take caution: though rare, some children are still allergic.

 This is the best temperature for reheating bread. Any hotter and the bread could burn quickly. A lower temperature would require a longer cooking time, resulting in dry bread. If you want a soft interior with a chewy crust, 350℉ (175℃) is the way to go.It's better to slice the bread after reheating rather than slicing it before reheating. Sliced bread will heat quickly and become hard and crunchy if you're not careful.
However, if you want to make bread crumbs or croutons, you can slice or dice the bread. Toss it with some melted butter, a dash of salt and pepper and some garlic powder, and you'll end up with a delicious topping for your salad.;
, This will protect the crust and help stop it from getting burned while the inside of the bread heats. If you try to reheat it unwrapped, the crust could overcook and turn out hard.
 For small or thin loaves of bread such as baguettes, limit the baking time to 10 minutes. For larger, thicker loaves of bread, bake for 15 minutes so the center has time to warm up.
 Serve the bread right away so it doesn't have time to cool again. Reheating bread a third time probably will result in a less-than-optimal taste and texture.

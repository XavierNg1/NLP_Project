 There are a lot of ways to go by this. Common one to start with is the spring. Simply hold the deck with your thumb on the rear/back short edge and your four fingers on the front short edge. Put pressure so that the deck bends inwards and slowly release the pressure with your thumb while catching the cards on the other hand. More ways of doing a fancy display is the dribble, thumb/one handed fan and Lepaul spread(a more advanced one).
 This is a crucial flourish for anyone interested in cardistry. It is not very complicated and it is the gateway to advance cardistry flourishes. It can also be used during a magic trick that calls for a false cut.
 There are lots of places where you can learn more flourishes and moves to fill up your fancy handling of cards. Youtube and DVDs are the most commonly used today. Search up names such as Daniel Madison, Zach Mueller and Dan&Dave. You'll find a lot of flourishes with different names such as Phaced, Aphex, Mousetrap, Werm ect.
 Again, flourishing takes time to get fluently. So take time for each flourish you wish to practice before moving into another flourish. The move should look smooth and natural. That's when you're good to keep going.
 Frustration is common when you're starting out. Your hand might not be 'big' enough at first, you'll drop cards, all of that will happen. No one was born master at cardistry. You just keep practicing and it will come to your realization that it's all about muscle memory.

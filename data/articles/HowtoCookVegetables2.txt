 Grilling is a great cooking method for lots of vegetables, and popular ones include onion, mushrooms, zucchini, eggplant, squash, asparagus, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, and corn.


Wash and scrub your vegetables. Remove any stems, skins, or woody parts.
Asparagus, mushrooms, corn, and small peppers can be left whole.
Cut onions, zucchini, eggplant, and squash into 0.5-inch (1.25-cm) disks.
 In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, lemon juice, herbs, and garlic. Place your vegetables into a sealable plastic bag or a glass bowl, and pour the marinade over the veggies.Stir to combine, or close the bag and shake the veggies around to coat them in the marinade.
Set aside and let the vegetables marinate for at least an hour.
 When you're ready to cook your vegetables, heat your grill to medium. If you're using a charcoal grill, get the coals nice and hot, and then let them burn until you have a large base of embers.


Once the grill is preheated, you can cook the veggies.
 Larger vegetables can be laid out directly on the grill. Make sure to spread them out so they aren't overlapping, and let the excess marinade drip off before placing them on the grill. Smaller vegetables can go on the grill in a basket, on skewers, or wrapped in foil.Thinner and less dense vegetables will take about three to five minutes to cook. Larger and denser vegetables will take about eight to ten minutes. Use tongs or a metal spatula to flip the vegetables halfway through cooking.Root vegetables like potatoes and carrots should be cooked in foil to prevent them from burning on the outside and not cooking on the inside.
 Using tongs or the spatula, remove the vegetables from the grill and place them on individual plates or a large serving platter.


Season the veggies with additional herbs and spices before serving if desired.

 In order to change your call volume, you'll need to be in a call first.


To initiate a call, open the Phone app, select a contact from the "Contacts" tab, and tap Call.
To receive a call, tap Accept (or slide the Swipe to Answer button to the right if your phone is locked).;
, These are physical buttons on the top left side of your phone's case.

There should be two buttons--the top one increases your volume, while the bottom one decreases it.
 Doing so will increase or decrease your volume respectively.

 These are in the left hand column under the tab that shows a fence around dirt. The amount of dirt squares available increases with different levels, so work with what you have at the beginning.;
,, The available crops will appear. Tap on the crop you wish to plant and drag your finger over the dirt square. The crop will be planted. All you need do now is wait.
 First, you'll see nothing, then small stumps of plant growth, followed by taller but green and immature growth. Finally, the entire plant in all its color will appear, denoting the crop has matured and is ready for harvesting.


Each crop has a different maturity time. Wheat takes about 2 minutes, while strawberries take much longer.
 Tap on the mature crop. A sickle will appear.
 The vegetables, grains or other plants will fly up into your storage tower (inventory). Continue until the entire crop has been reaped.
 You can grow the same crop or grow a new one, depending on what you need.
 For chocolate, cherries and apples (and much later, olives), you'll need to plant trees. Look in the left hand column for the tree/bush icon and open the tab. The types of trees available to you will descend and you can purchase as many as you want, provided you have sufficient funds.


Trees can be harvested three times––hover over them and a basket will appear; simply drag it over to harvest. After each harvest, the tree matures and provides more fruit until the last harvest. At the last harvest, the tree dies and must be chopped down with the large axe.
 For raspberries, blackberries, and coffee beans, you'll need to plant bushes. They can be found in the same way as the trees, and they harvest the same way. To get rid of a bush, use the small axe.
 Use the exclamation ("!") icon to tell visitors you need their help to get rid of a spent tree or bush. Reward anyone who helps you.


It's recommended that you hang on to your axes; they don't fetch a lot when sold and they're hard to come by, so cherish them.

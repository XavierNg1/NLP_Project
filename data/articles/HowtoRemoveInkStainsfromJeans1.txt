 Using a white towel will ensure that no additional color will be transferred to the fabric during the stain removal. The towel placed inside the jeans will prevent the ink from spreading to other areas of the jeans., For small stains, the alcohol can be applied with a cotton ball or cotton swab.Be careful to pour the alcohol slowly and just on the ink so the stain doesnâ€™t bleed and spread.
 Each time you blot use a clean cotton ball or a new spot on the cloth as the ink will be drawn out of the jeans with the alcohol or hairspray.
 Be sure to use cold water as hot water may set any remaining ink and make the stain much harder to remove.
 Check to be sure that all of the ink is gone before drying the jeans because the heat from the dryer will make the stain set in. If any ink remains repeat the process of blotting with alcohol and wash the jeans again.

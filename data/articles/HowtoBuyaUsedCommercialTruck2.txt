 Most used commercial trucks cost between $30,000 and $250,000, depending on the truck. Use a lender you have worked with before, or a company you know is reliable and respected.
 Most lenders will look for at least 20 percent of the purchase price as a down payment.


Balance your down payment size with the cash needs of your business. While a larger down payment will mean a less expensive loan, it will also take extra cash out of your daily business operations.
 This will include your CDL license, proof of income, financial statements and a good credit report.
 This will include the amount of your monthly payment, the length of the loan and how much interest you will pay until the loan is paid off.
 The lender will likely pay the seller directly.

  Cut out a 4–5 inch (10.2–12.7 cm) square of cardboard from a discarded grocery box.  It must be corrugated cardboard.  Hold it so the small holes in the lining of the cardboard are going from side to side.;
,  Draw a smaller circle at the top for the spider's head.  Go all the way to the edges of the cardboard to maximize the space and give you a large spider.
  Ordinary household scissors work fine.
  Use a large paper clip that you have bent into a flat shape.  Bend one end straight, form a hooked shape.
  Tape it on the front and back using masking tape.
  Use a needle nose pliers to bend the wire at of the top.
  You will use these holes to secure the legs.
  Wad up small pieces of newspaper and tape the pads to the top and bottom of the spider using long strips of masking tape.
  Criss-cross the crepe paper as you work.  Stretch the streamers slightly as you wrap to make it conform to the rounded edges of the head and body.  At the end, finish by gluing the strip with tacky glue.
  Use a toothpick to find them.
  Go in the holes you made with the toothpick, sticking half a black craft stem or fuzzy pipe cleaner into the hole.  It will stay, but to be extra sure, you can dip the end of the pipe cleaner into tacky glue.
  Make as many as you wish.  Bend them at the knee and out to create a foot.,  Use tacky glue to place googly eyes.  If you want a mouth, cut a tiny sliver of white paper and glue it in place.
  Be creative and embellish this spider as much as you wish.
  Knot it securely.
  This will be a chilling surprise for visitors.

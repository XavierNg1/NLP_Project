 Make a list of words including adjectives, nouns, and verbs that remind you of the topic and any specific images related to the topic that come to mind. With that list, write at least two synonyms for each word containing more or less syllables. This way, you have a word bank to come back to if a word doesn't quite fit.;
, The phrase "iambic pentameter" simply means that each line of poetry contains ten syllables, or five "iambs." An iamb consists of two syllables: unstressed and stressed. This means the second word has more emphasis when read aloud, or is more stressed than the first. Let's look at an example of a sonnet, taken from Sonnet CXXX (130) by William Shakespeare:Â Now, let's take a look at the first line.


To help you hear the beat, tap your fingers on each syllable as you read aloud, tapping harder the second time. Do you hear it?

My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red, than her lips red:
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.


Did you notice how it naturally sounded like music? "My Mistress' EYES are nothing LIKE the SUN." It's like a dance, elegant yet simple. Apply that to your own poem. Does it flow well? If not, did you see another word in your list that would work better?

, Use words with double meanings if you'd like to. If you are still unsure of yourself, it's best to keep it simple.
 Anyone can write it if they put their hearts into it. Try not to get frustrated if something doesn't quite work, and don't be afraid to ask your friends or family for help. The more time you put into it, the better it will be. Good luck!

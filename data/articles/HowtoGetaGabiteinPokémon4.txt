 You can catch a wild Gible on Route 13 in the tall grass. Route 13 connects Lumiose City and Coumarine City, and houses the Kalos Power Plant. Gible is fairly common, with a 20% chance of appearing for each battle., Gible will be between Levels 26-28. Whittle its health down and capture it in a Poke Ball to add it to your team., Since the Gible you caught in the wild is between Levels 26-28, it will evolve into a Gabite immediately when it gains its next level. Using a Rare Candy will be the quickest way to do this., You can capture a Gabite from the Friend Safari after defeating the Elite Four. You'll need to add a friend with a Friend Code that unlocks the Dragon-type safari in Slot 1. This is determined by the code, so you'll need to keep adding friends until you find someone with a code that works.Once you have the right Friend Code, you'll have a 50% chance of encountering a Level 30 Gabite.

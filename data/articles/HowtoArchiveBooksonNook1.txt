 The process of archiving a book on your Nook is basically the same no matter whether you're using a Nook tablet or you're using the Nook app on your mobile device. To start, open your Nook library — the menu where your books and other documents are displayed.


On a Nook tablet, you can press the button that looks like an upside down "U" at any time to access the navigation bar. Once you do this, click "Library" to access your library.
On smartphones, the quickest way to get to your library can vary. For instance, on iOS, if you're reading a book, you can tap the middle of the screen to display the tools menu, then tap the option in the top left to get to your library.On Android, you can use the same approach or simply hit the back button.;
, Next, scroll through the list of books and find the first book in your library that you'd like to archive. Tap on it and hold down. A menu of options should appear. You may release your hold when this list shows up.
 Clicking this will remove the selected book from your device, freeing up space for different books.


To be clear, you will still own the book after archiving it — archiving the book stores it in the cloud, rather than deleting it entirely. You can easily get your books back after archiving them (see below for more information.)

, Repeat the sequence above for every book that you'd like to archive. When you've archived your last book, congratulations — you're done! If you'd like, you can now fill the space you've just freed up with new books.
 The archival process requires a valid wi-fi connection to work. Since the archived books are stored in a remote server until you want to access them again, the Nook needs access to the internet to be able to transmit these books to the server. Thus, if you're unable to archive your books, the most likely culprit is your wi-fi connection. Double-check your device's wi-fi settings and, if you're at home, consider resetting your router.

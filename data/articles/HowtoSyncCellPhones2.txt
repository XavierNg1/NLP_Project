 Go to the phone settings and switch on its Bluetooth feature from here.
 Take one of the phones, and using its Bluetooth application, look for the second phone you have. After turning on the Bluetooth of the two phones, it should automatically display the other on the “Nearby Devices” list.


Select the detected phone from the “Nearby List” and press “Pair.” The first phone will send a request/permission to pair to the second phone before establishing a Bluetooth connection.
 This will start bridging the connection. After allowing the Bluetooth connection, the two phones is now in sync with each other and can start transferring media contents and files between each other.


Some phones will require you to enter a “Passcode” before you can approve the Bluetooth connection. Unless you’ve changed it already, the default passcodes for Bluetooth connections is usually 0000.

 Start by using a spatula to apply the Scar Effects gel in the shape of the laceration on the desired area of skin. The gel will form the edges of the wound whilst blood will be in the middle.
 Be creative with it.
 Using the Ben Nye cuts and bruises wheel, dab some red around the Scar Effects gel to give the wound definition. Blend well.
 Using a bruise wheel, dab a little dark blue inside the wound to add depth.
 Finished.

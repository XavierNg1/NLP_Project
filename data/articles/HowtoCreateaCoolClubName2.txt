 What's the point of your club? Do you just want to get together and talk or play, or do you want to do something at school or in your neighborhood? The purpose of your club will have a big effect on the name that you choose.
 Do you want your club name to describe what your club is all about? Or do you have a secret club that needs a name that will keep other people from knowing what the club's all about? For an open club, you need a name that anyone can understand. For a closed club, come up with an inside joke or a code name.
 Get together and make a list of ideas. You'll be surprised at what you'll come up with in a group that you couldn't have come up with on your own.


Think of something that all of your club members have in common. If you all like the same music, then you can add something about your favorite band to your club name.
Break out your thesaurus. If you can say something ordinary in an extraordinary way, then your club name will really stand out from the crowd.
Choose a name from a book, television program or online game. Sometimes, it's okay to borrow from something that's already been created.
 A 3 or 4-word name is easy to remember and easy to abbreviate.

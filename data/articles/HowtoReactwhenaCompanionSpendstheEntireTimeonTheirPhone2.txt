 Ahead of time, plan 5 minutes during your date or outing when you and your companion will check your phones. It can be helpful to select a moment of transition form one activity to another. Doing this allows your companion to know they will have time set aside to address any important communications that come up, putting them at ease for the rest of the outing.


To a romantic partner you might say, “I really want to focus on each other tonight. Can we leave our phones in the car during dinner? We can check them before we drive to the movies to make sure work hasn’t called you.”
To a coworker you might say, “Can we sideline our phones for the meeting? Let’s give each other our undivided attention to discuss the proposal. We can check for new messages on the way to the client luncheon.”

, Certain activities are not conducive to checking phones because you need both hands to do them. If your partner or friend has a consistent problem with checking their phone, try mobile-unfriendly activities, such as rock climbing or canoeing, to get more quality time when you hang out. You may even get extra enjoyment doing something out of the ordinary together.
 If your partner or friend’s phone interruptions are largely tied to a specific work schedule, try scheduling your hangouts on other days. This will help you have a more productive friendship or relationship.


For example, if your partner or friend is a social worker who is always on call on Tuesdays, let’s say, schedule outings on other days so your companion can better balance their work needs with your social ones.

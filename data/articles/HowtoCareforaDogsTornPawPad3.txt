 Until your dog’s paw is healed, you will need to replace the wound dressing each day, or more often if there is additional bleeding or seepage. Since dogs sweat from their paws, you will need to keep a close eye on the bandage to ensure it stays dry and clean., Dogs may try to lick or remove the gauze and bandage, and this will lengthen the time it takes for the wound to heal. Additionally, it could lead to infection. You can use a taste deterrent, such as bitter apple spray, on the outside of the bandages to dissuade your dog from licking or chewing on it.


If the taste deterrent doesn’t work, you may have to use an E-collar, the lampshade-shaped collar that restricts movement, for a few days., Even though your dog is injured, he will still need to go out for a walk or potty break occasionally. To further protect your dog’s paw and to keep the recovery on track, use a dog boot to cover the wound and bandages when going outside.
 If, after three days of treatment, the wound continues to bleed or opens up, take your dog to a veterinarian for further treatment., An infected paw can cause long-term problems if not treated quickly. During the healing process, look for swelling or redness in the paw pad, which may indicate an infection. When changing your dog’s bandages, a foul odor or moist discharge could also be signs of an infection. Another sign of possible infection is if your dog suddenly seems to be in more pain or even refuses to walk. If any of these occur, consult your veterinarian immediately.

 When you bend metal, you naturally weaken it. When done correctly, however, you can minimize damage and still get the shape you need to complete the project. Keep the following in mind as you work:Always note the grade and size of the bar you're bending, checking against the equipment you're using to ensure it works.
Check with your project engineer to ensure your bends meet the minimal internal bend diameter. If you don't know what this is for your project, wait until you do.
Never re-bend rebar. Once you've bent it, it's finished. Continually working it will significantly lower its strength.;
, These devices usually clamp the rebar down, allowing you to pull down on the free end to bend it. The bar is set on a cast-iron die, allowing you to easily bend it to your desired curve. However, they are slow, only bending one piece at once, and they usually only bend in 90-degree increments, meaning you must guess to get other angles. However, they are also relatively cheap.Cost from $200-500.
Can only handle lower-grade steel and sizes.
 These electric or gasoline-powered motors are essential if you need a lot of bends quickly, all to a standardized length. Many come with cutters, too, allowing you to sheer overly long bars. Though expensive, and heavy, they are essential for big construction crews who need precise, frequent rebar adjustments. To use it, simply turn it on, set your desired angle and length, and feed in the rebar.


Cost from $3,000-5,000.
Can handle any grade steel, or any size., The process of molding or shaping the rebar often causes coatings to chip and flake off. As long as your remember to check and touch up the areas that you've bent, however, you should not have much of an issue.

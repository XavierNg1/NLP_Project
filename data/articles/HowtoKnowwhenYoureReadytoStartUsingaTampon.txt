 What could make it uncomfortable to use is a small vaginal opening, so keep this in mind when deciding whether or not to start using tampons.;
, There are options such as menstrual cups and soft cups which are safer and can be more convenient than tampons, while other girls prefer external products like pads during their periods. What you use when you are young is what you are likely to use as you grow up, so know that what you are using is best for you.
 Knowing where your vaginal opening is and how it curves within your body makes insertion easier, but also knowing how your vagina functions helps you understand how tampons effect your vagina and how this can effect vaginal health. This allows you to make an educated decision about whether tampons are best for you or not. Every package of tampons comes with an insert that explains this, so take the time to read it all the way through before using one.
 Even though your body might be ready for tampons, you might not be. You must be comfortable enough with your body that you can insert and remove tampons, and you must be mindful enough to change the tampon frequently and follow precautions (see the Warnings below). If you are squeamish or forgetful, you might want to stay away from tampons.
 As you get more comfortable with tampons, you can start using them on the first and last days of your period, but you should never use them before or after your period.
 When you first start using tampons, you won't know when it's ready to be taken out. In a few hours, take it out by pulling gently on the string with your muscles relaxed. Soon you'll get to where you can feel the difference between one that's full and one that isn't. However, you should never wear a tampon for more than 8 hours at a time.
 Using tampons doesn't make you any more mature, just like using pads doesn't make you immature, you need to make your own decision about whether or not to use tampons.

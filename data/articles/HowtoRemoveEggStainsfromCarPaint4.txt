 This specialty cleaner type was made for instances just like this one. The Wash & Wax will clean away dirt and stains and leave the paint polished to protect it, essentially mimicking the function of a clear coat of paint.Wash & Wax cleaners work essentially the same way that brake cleaner fluid does, but are intended for use on the vehicle's exterior and are safer for most common uses.
There is no guarantee that a Wash & Wax will work for its applied purpose here. They can be an effective cleaner for many types of dirt and stains that build up on vehicles, but you'll be using at your own risk.
 Cover the whole stain and let sit for a few minutes. The cleaner will begin to work on the stain on its own, saving you trouble and preventing potential damage later.
 Don't get too rough, as you'll be scraping directly against the paint. Take off as many pieces of the soaked stain as you can and wipe them away with a towel.Nylon scrapers are cheap and safe. It's better to spring for one than to use a harder scraper with unexpected results.
 Use another small amount of cleaner on the area where the stain was. Rub out any remnants of the stain or excess cleaner until the spot looks clean and smooth. The wax in the solution should leave your paint with a protective luster.


Use a microfiber cloth to buff the spot. In all, this should only take about 20 minutes, with minimal muscle.

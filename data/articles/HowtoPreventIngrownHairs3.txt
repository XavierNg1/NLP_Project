 If you decide to wax instead of shave, you are still at risk for getting ingrown hairs, especially in the bikini area. Always cleanse and exfoliate your skin before waxing. Reduce your risk of infection by using a new applicator stick for each application of wax., Depilatory creams work by dissolving the hair rather than cutting it or pulling it out of the skin. For this reason, they are less likely to lead to ingrown hairs.Chemical hair removers can cause rashes or irritation in some people. Test the product on a small area of your skin before use., Laser hair removal is a semi-permanent hair removal technique that involves destroying the hair and the root with a guided laser beam. While this technique does not usually completely eliminate hair in the treated area, it will reduce hair density significantly. This reduces the need for shaving, plucking, and other hair removal techniques that lead to ingrown hairs.Laser hair removal is relatively safe, and the side effects (typically redness and irritation) are usually mild and temporary. In rare cases, permanent scarring may occur.
Keep in mind that laser hair removal can be costly. Typically, multiple treatments are needed over the course of several months in order for the treatment to be effective.

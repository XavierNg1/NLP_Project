 Hook your bathing suit bottoms with your pointer fingers and use your thumbs to pull down your swimsuit. Since the towel should be covering you, put on your underwear and then you can put on your pants.;
, Face the wall and take off the top of your swimsuit. Use the towel to dry off your back and chest that the swimsuit was covering. Then, quickly put on your bra (if you have one) and your shirt. There's no better way to avoid this.

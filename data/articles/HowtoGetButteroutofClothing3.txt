 Although some people have found success using WD-40, hairspray, and lighter fluid on especially tough grease stains, you run a high risk of damaging your clothing — for example, lighter fluid can damage the color of dyed clothing.These products can also leave behind a terrible smell that is more difficult to mask than the original stain.


Test the product on a small, easily hidden patch of fabric on the garment before applying it to the stain.
Let it sit for half an hour, then check whether or not the cloth has been damaged in any way.
If not, proceed to the next step.
 WD-40 and hairspray come in spray bottles, so be sure to apply the product from a close range, keeping the spray area constrained to the stain. Lighter fluid tends to squirt out in big gushes, so apply it to a paper towel or dishcloth first, then rub the towel onto the stain. This will ensure you don’t drench your garment in lighter fluid and can control the area you wish to treat.
, Give the product enough time to loosen the butter stain. Set the garment aside somewhere and forget about it for an hour.
 Again, use the hottest possible water setting allowable for the fabric you’re dealing with. The hotter the water, the better the chances of stain removal.


Check the garment to make sure the stain has been removed before running it through the dryer, as the heat will set the stain even further.

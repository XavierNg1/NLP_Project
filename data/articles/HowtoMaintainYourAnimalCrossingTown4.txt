 Animal Crossing can be a demanding game. If you do not visit regularly, weeds will take over your town’s landscape and citizens will wonder where you’ve been.


Furthermore, if you aren’t playing regularly, then you will miss opportunities to make your town better.
 Time functions in the game Animal Crossing in the same way that it does for you. This means that if your 3DS is set to the current time and date, then that is the time and date that it will be in your town.


If your 3DS is set to a different time and date, then your Animal Crossing town will be set to that date instead.
 10 to 15 minutes should be plenty of time to keep your town well maintained each day. During that time, you should try to pull weeds and talk with all of your citizens.


Talking to your citizens is covered in Method 1, while gardening is covered in Methods 2 and 3.

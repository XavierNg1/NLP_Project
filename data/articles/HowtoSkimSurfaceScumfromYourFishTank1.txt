 Old fish food, waste, algae, and other debris can collect on the surface of the water. Using an aquarium net, gently scoop up waste from the surface of the water. Do this slowly so that you do not disturb your fish. Empty the net into a trashcan between each scoop.


While you can use a net to clear debris floating in the water, you should be careful when scooping along the bottom of your tank. If you scrape the gravel, you could release more dust and debris into the water.;
, The glass of your fish tank may become dirty over time from debris, algae, or dirty water. Cleaning the glass weekly will prevent more scum from gathering in your tank. First, drain a few inches of water with a siphon so that you do not spill water during cleaning.Using a tank scraper or a sponge, reach down into the tank, and wipe off the debris from the glass. You may need to clean your tool between wipes to ensure that more debris does not enter the water.


If you have an acrylic tank, you should use a sponge marked as safe for acrylic. , If you notice a milky or oily film on top of the water, you have protein build-up in your tank. This is normal, but you will not be able to remove it with a net. Instead, take a single piece of a paper towel. Lay it on the surface of the water until it is soaked through. Remove the paper towel. The protein will come off with the towel. Repeat with fresh towels until the surface is clear.

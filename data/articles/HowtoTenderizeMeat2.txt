 Muscle fibers in meat are surrounded by layers of collagen, which is connective tissue. When the collagen gets heated up to a temperature of 140ºF (60ºC), the collagen will tighten and shrink, causing the meat’s juices to be squeezed out, making for a very dry cut of meat (which you don’t want unless you love really well-done steak). Instead, heat meat to 160ºF (71.1ºC) or more and the collagen will start to become gelatinous, actually giving the meat a ‘fork tender’ texture that will melt in your mouth.Tenderizing meat with heat is best used on brisket, ribs or other meats with a lot of collagen. It does not work well on pork chops or filet mignon.
 You can use either dry heat or wet heat. Grilling is a great example of dry heat, while braising is a good example of wet heat. During the grilling process, the grilled meat is cooked slowly, allowing the meat to become tender. Braising meat is when you submerge meat in a flavorful liquid and cook it.
 Regardless of what method you use, the key to getting your meat tender with heat is to cook it slowly. If you do not cook your meat slowly, the outer surface of the cut will start to burn before the collagen in the meat has a chance to turn into gelatin.

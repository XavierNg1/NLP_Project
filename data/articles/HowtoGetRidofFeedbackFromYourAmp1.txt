 High gain on a guitar is a common culprit for feedback. Max gain increases the input signal until the output reaches maximum levels.If it’s too high on either your amp or your guitar, it could be creating feedback.


There should be at least two knobs on the face of your guitar. One of these should be the gain. Turn this counter-clockwise to reduce the gain.
You can keep the gain at three-fourths max or less on both your amp and guitar to prevent feedback. If you are still experiencing it, try turning it down even lower.;
, Try turning down the volume on your guitar knob while turning the volume on your amplifier up. This will increase the output while decreasing the input and could prevent feedback. You should always try to alter the volume of your music by your amp, and not with the guitar’s knob to prevent instant feedback as soon as you plug in your guitar.


Another knob on the body of your guitar should control the volume. Turn this counter-clockwise to reduce your volume.
Some guitars have numbers, 1-10 to designate the level of sound. If yours does, turn it to 8.
If the knob on your guitar is not working, see if you can buy a replacement knob at a guitar store. If that doesn't work, you may have to take it to get repaired.
 High treble and low bass can create feedback. Make sure that the levels that you’re playing create the most robust sound while eliminating any feedback. Test this by playing notes on your guitar while adjusting each knob separately.


All amps are different so you will most likely have to change the levels on your amplifier a couple of times to see what works best.

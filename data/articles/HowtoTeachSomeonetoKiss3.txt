 If your partner is nervous about how they kiss, you can play a fun kissing game to help show how you want to be kissed. Play a mirror kissing game with your partner by taking turns giving each other kisses. First, you kiss your partner how you like to be kissed and then ask your partner to give you a kiss that’s exactly the same. Then, let your partner give you a kiss and you copy it.By playing this game, you’ll find out what kind of kisses you both like and it will help you become closer to each other.
 One of the best ways to help your partner be more open to kissing you is to say how you liked to be kissed. Have an open conversation with your partner to say that you want your partner to occasionally take the lead when you’re kissing. Explain to your partner exactly what type of kisses you like and where you want to receive them.


If you enjoy kisses on your neck leading up to your lips, let your boyfriend know this is what really turns you on.
Maybe you enjoy being surprised by an impromptu makeout session. Tell your girlfriend you really want to be surprised by her kissing you when you least expect it.
 You can encourage your partner to kiss you by setting the mood first. Sometimes you need to find some alone time to encourage your date to feel comfortable.


Snuggle up on the couch with the lights down low to create an intimate mood.
Bring your date on a picnic and pick an area away from other people to enjoy each other's company.
 Sometimes shy kissers have a lack of self confidence when it comes to kissing, so give encouragement when you receive a kiss you really like. Telling your girlfriend you really liked how she kissed you will help raise her self confidence and make her more likely to kiss you like that again.Say things like, “I like that” or “that feels good” during a kissing session are a great way to show your appreciation.

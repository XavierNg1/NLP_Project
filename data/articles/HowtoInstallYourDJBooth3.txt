 Be careful when removing items such as turntables as they can be fragile and may have cables that are soldered on that you do not want to accidentally tear off.


While unpacking try to keep the cables together with the items they came with.
For turntables follow the included instructions for assembling and attacking the cartridges and needles, and if it is not already in place for installing the platter.
 The heavier the table the better protected from ground vibration you will be.
 The most common layout is however some people prefer . You also need to decide on an orientation for the turntables:



Standard (Horizontal) Standard orientation will see the tone-arm and pitch on the right and the start/stop on the edge closest to you and to the left. This is used by DJ's who mix records as they need easy access to the pitch.

Battle (Vertical) Battle position will see the tone-arm and pitch on the edge furthest away from you and the start/stop on the edge closest to you and to the right. This is used by scratch artists as it keeps the tone arm out of the way so they do not bump it when preforming quick scratches.
 You also need to connect the ground cables which are usually thin black cables with a "C" shaped connector this will fit over a screw on the back of the mixer labeled "Ground" or "GRND" and help reduce line noise.
 It is recommended you use a serge protector or a power bar with serge protection for this to protect your equipment.
, Check the back of your speakers and the back of you mixer to determine the type of cables you need. Ensure the mixer and the speakers are both off and then connect the cable from the output of the mixer to the input of the speakers. Always turn the mixer on before turning on the speakers to avoid sending a power 'pop' to the speakers.

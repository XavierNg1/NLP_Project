 There should be no other horses/ponies in the arena. There should also be no blocks or jumps in the way. You can have some light-weight blocks and poles at the side to make a jump with later.;
, Depending on the weather you might need to put a rug on your horse/pony. Your horse/pony should also have a headcollar on. It does not have to be leather or "field safe" because you are not leaving your horse/pony unattended.
 Let your horse/pony have a bit of free time. If they want to go galloping and bucking then this is their chance. If they just stand there looking bored don't worry.



Lead your horse around. By doing this, you get your horse comfortable with you and she will trust you a little bit more.
 Start to walk towards your horse/pony. Your should be just opposite your horse's/pony's shoulder. Now encourage your horse/pony to start moving. If your horse/pony is quite lazy you could use a whip at this stage, as if you are lunging.
 This game is called "Chase" or "It". You can start getting your horse/pony to run with you.
 Or, introduce a horse ball.

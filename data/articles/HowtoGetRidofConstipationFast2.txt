 Laxatives can occasionally cause dehydration, so you will need water intake to ensure fast recovery.
 Generally, these gentle laxatives are not known for quick relief; however, they are easier on the system if you’ve already tried other methods.
 Stool softeners are another mild method and may be ok to use in combination with natural and more aggressive methods.
 They may go by names like Senekot or Correctol. These laxatives will cause cramping, since they stimulate the bowel muscles to contract.


Use stimulant laxatives only if you are in need of fast relief. Don’t use them regularly, since they are known to cause dehydration with repeated use.
Don’t rely on this method to keep you regular. You can become reliant on laxatives.

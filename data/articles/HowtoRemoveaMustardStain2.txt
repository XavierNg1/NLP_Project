 Use a spoon or other utensil to pick up excess mustard from the upholstery or carpet. Take care to lift fresh mustard directly up and away from the stained surface, rather than spreading it further. You may wish to use a butter knife to scrape off dried mustard stains.
 Take one cup (240 mL) of lukewarm water and stir in one teaspoon (5 mL) of mild detergent. Avoid using harsh cleaning products such as bleach, bicarbonate of soda, or washing soda., Use a sponge or towel to apply the detergent mixture over the mustard stain. Leave it in place for 5 to 10 minutes while the material absorbs the cleaning product.
 Use a paper towel or dry, absorbent towel to press against the stain and wet area. If the stain does not come off, rub slightly, taking care not to spread it further. Mustard stains are among the hardest food stains to remove, so results may be limited.
 If some but not all of the yellow stain came off onto your towel, you may succeed by repeating this method one or more times. Remember to let each application of detergent and water sit for at least 5 minutes before blotting.


If the first attempt with detergent produced no noticeable results, move on to the section on persistent stains.

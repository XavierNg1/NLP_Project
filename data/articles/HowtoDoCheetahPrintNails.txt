 To create the full cheetah print effect on your nails, you will need to get nail polish that is black, brown, and beige. These three colors together will create a fun cheetah print.You can substitute the beige for a gold or cream color, based on your preference. If you would like a more colorful cheetah print, you could use a bright color like pink or blue instead of the beige.
You may also want to get a nude nail polish as the base color for your nails if you would like the cheetah print to pop. Leaving your nails bare and then applying the print is always an option but the nude will make the print stand out more.;
, You will need to use a dotting tool to create the cheetah print. You can use a thin paint brush, a plastic or metal nail dotting tool, or a toothpick. Any of these items will work as a dotting tool.You will also need a piece of scrap paper, such as an index card. You will use the paper as your palette so you should use paper that is thick and durable.
 You should look for a top coat that is clear and quick drying. This will speed up the process of prepping your nails for the cheetah print and seal your cheetah print look once it is done. You can find quick drying top coats online or in the beauty aisle of your local drugstore., Before you do the cheetah print, you should start with a neutral, clean base. Remove any nail polish on your nails with nail polish remover and cotton balls. Be sure to get off all of the existing color, as you want to have a clean base for the cheetah print./images/thumb/0/0d/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-4-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-4-Version-5.jpg

You may also trim your nails so they are the desired length and shape. You may use a nail buffer to polish and smooth the surface of your nails. This will help the cheetah print to look clean and smooth on your nails.
 Once your nails are clean and trimmed, you should apply two coats of your chosen base color. You may use beige, gold, nude, or a bright color like blue as the base. You may also decide to keep your nails bare, with no base color./images/thumb/8/8c/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-5-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-5-Version-5.jpg

If you are using a base color, make sure you brush the color from the cuticle to the top of your nail. Always apply the polish from the middle of your nail to the outer sides.
Let your nails dry after the first coat. Then, apply the second coat. Try not to let the nail polish get cakey or thick on your nails, as you want a nice, even base coat.
 You should allow the base coat to dry completely before proceeding with the cheetah print. You may let your nails sit under a fan for 20-30 minutes so they are completely dry and ready for the cheetah print.You may decide to add one layer of quick dry top coat to smooth out the base coat and speed up the drying time. Only add a thin layer of top coat, as you do not want the base coat to get thick or clumpy.
 You will need to set up a palette of colors for the cheetah print so they are easy to access. Use the nail polish brush to put a small amount of the brown color on the piece of scrap paper. Then, put a small amount of the black color on the other end of the scrap paper. Make sure the two colors do not mix on the palette./images/thumb/f/f1/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-7-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-7-Version-5.jpg
/images/thumb/f/f1/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-7-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-7-Version-5.jpg









Start with a small amount of each color and then add more nail polish to the palette as you go. This will ensure the nail polish does not start to dry or get clumpy as you create the cheetah print on each nail.
If you are using bronze, gold, or another color for the brown part of the cheetah spots, pour out that color on the palette so it is ready to go.
 Take your dipping tool, such as a toothpick, and dab it into the brown color. Then, use the tool to add small dots of brown polish to your nail. The dots should be fairly wide, forming spots. You want to ensure there is enough space between the dots for the black semi-circles so leave a little room between each dot./images/thumb/e/e6/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-8-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-8-Version-5.jpg

Add small brown spots to all of your nails, using more brown color on your palette as necessary. Don’t worry about the dots appearing too perfect and round. They should look like spots, not polkadots.
 Once the brown spots have been added to your nails, you will need to add semi-circles in black around the spots. Clean the dipping tool with water and a paper towel or use a new toothpick. Dab your dipping tool into the black polish and draw a small “C” or semi-circle around the edge of the brown dot. You want the semi-circle to be thin and flush to the brown dot./images/thumb/8/8b/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-9-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-9-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/8/8b/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-9-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-9-Version-4.jpg









Add semi-circles to all the brown dots on your nails, making sure they appear as small “C”s that are thin and flush to the brown dot. Check that the semi-circles do not touch each other, as you do not want the cheetah spots to blend together. There should be a small amount of space between each semi-circle on your nail.
 Now that you have your cheetah spots, you can add smaller dots in the empty spaces around the black circles to fill them. You can use black polish or brown polish to fill in the spaces. Clean off the dipping tool with water and add your chosen color to your palette. Then, use the dipping tool to add smaller dots around the cheetah spots./images/thumb/9/94/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-10-Version-3.jpg

Do this for all of your nails. Do not worry about the dots appearing perfectly round or the same size. They can be small dabs or dots, as long as they fill up the empty spaces between the spots.
 Let the cheetah spots dry under a fan for 20 to 30 minutes. Then, seal in the cheetah print with a clear top coat./images/thumb/d/dd/Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Cheetah-Print-Nails-Step-11-Version-3.jpg

You can touch up your cheetah print nails if they start to chip using the dipping tool and more brown and black polish. These nails should look good for a few days, with minimal wear and tear on your hands.

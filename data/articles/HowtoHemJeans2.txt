 The best way to do this is to put your jeans on (or have the person who will be wearing the jeans put them on) and fold the cuff under until the jeans are the length you’d like them to be. Then, use a piece of chalk to mark the spot where the new hem should end.
 Measure ½” from the hem line and draw a line above it that is running parallel to the first one. Then, measure and mark another ½” below the original line and draw the line so it is parallel to the original one as well.








Now you should have three lines total. These lines will serve as a guide for you to sew the new hem.
 Cut off the bottom of the jeans and the old hem. To do this, cut in a straight line along the bottom line that you made. Discard the material that you cut off.
 Next, fold along the center chalk line to create the new hem. You may also want to pin along the new hem to hold it in place while you sew. Check to make sure that the hem is even all the way around before you sew.
 Using some gold denim thread, or the thread color of your choice, sew around the area you pinned to hold the new hem in place. Use a straight stitch and try to keep it as even as possible.








Remove the pins as you go.
After you sew around both hems, your jeans will be ready to wear!

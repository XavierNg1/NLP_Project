 It seems like a simple objective, but it is by far the most important one—and not just for newcomers to the sport. Seeing how the sport is played—less as a fan, and more with an eye toward offensive and defensive setups—can give you a clearer picture of how a coach impacts the game. Study how offenses and defenses adjust to one another. Make note of when substitutions are made. Keep an eye on how players are matched up against each other. Write down everything you see, and study it every chance you get.;
, Coaching strategies are plastered all over the Internet. They range from simple half-court sets to more complicated plays featuring backdoor cuts, swing passes and plenty of movement without the ball. Start by learning some of the basic offensive and defensive plays, with emphasis on player positioning and movement. Once you have those memorized, add more plays to your repertoire. But don’t overdo it. Having a few go-to plays when you’re just starting out is good enough.
 The coaching fraternity is tight-knit, and fellow coaches are usually delighted to talk strategy and share their knowledge of the craft. Take in everything other coaches have to say. Even if you don’t agree with it, there may be some useful nuggets you can employ down the road. Don’t be afraid to ask plenty of questions.
 Every good coach has a handful of plays he has created himself. Even if your designs don’t immediately lead to certain victory, the act of creating plays—either through drawing up something from scratch or by taking an existing strategy and modifying it—is sure to broaden your knowledge base. You can always tinker with things as necessary.

 Propagating daffodils is largely a process of trial and error, therefore it's best to start with a large number of bulbs and to try all types of propagation before choosing a single method.


The first and simplest is sexual propagation, so called because it requires two plants to work.
 Despite it’s name, sexual propagation requires very little active involvement in the actual propagation.


You simply need to rely on bees, pollen, and the wind to do it’s job and collect seeds from the daffodil plants after blooms die back and a large seed pod appears.
 The seed will generate a young bulb which can be transferred to another location to produce a daffodil.


This method is best for those who, for whatever reason, were unable to work the soil to dig up the remaining bulbs. This process — while simple — is timely and will be unnecessary if the bulbs can be retrieved.

 This is the most common type of anemia, and it can sometimes be corrected by increasing your intake of iron. You may have IDA if you have experienced the following:


A heavy menstrual flow (iron is lost through the menstrual blood).
A severe injury during which you sustained a lot of blood loss.
Surgery that led to the loss of blood.
Ulcers or colon cancer.
A diet low in iron.
 This type of anemia results from having too little vitamin B12 in the body. B12 is necessary for the body to produce new blood cells and keep the nervous system healthy. You may have this type of anemia if the following is true:


You have an autoimmune disorder or intestinal problems that cause you to be unable to absorb vitamin B12 efficiently.
You don't have enough vitamin B12 in your diet. Since this vitamin is highly concentrated in foods that come from animals, vegetarians and vegans may have trouble getting enough B12.
 In some cases, anemia is caused by an underlying disease that affects the body's ability to create enough red blood cells to keep the body healthy. To determine whether this may be the case, discuss this with your doctor and undergo the appropriate tests.


Diseases that affect the kidneys can lower the body's ability to create red blood cells.
Anemias caused by inherited blood diseases include sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, and a plastic anemia, among others. Some people carry a predisposition for these anemias if one or both of their parents had the condition.
Acquired anemia is caused by exposure to toxins, viruses, chemicals or drugs that prevent the body from making healthy red blood cells.

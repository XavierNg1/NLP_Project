 Choosing an outfit can be the hardest part for Valentine's Day, but deciding what to wear really depends on where you are going and what you're doing. If you're going for a meal out or a posh dinner do, then wear a cute, slightly formal outfit, or even a sexy red dress. Wear posh heels and carry a clutch purse.
 A skirt and a pretty top will look good, with fashionable heels and a big handbag.
 If it's sunny, denim shorts, a cute top, gladiator sandals and sunglasses will look good, or if it's colder, wear skinny jeans, a fashionable top, heeled boots, shoobs (peep toe shoe boots) shoes or ankle boots and a shoulder bag/purse.,,

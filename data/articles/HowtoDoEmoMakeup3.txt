 Apply this with a foundation brush.It should be no lighter than one to two shades the your natural skin tone.
Foundation that is too light can make your skin look ashy or overly made up.
Foundation that is too dark can give your skin a yellow or orangish hue. This should be avoided when trying for an Emo style.
 Waterproof is recommended.


First use a black or brown eyeliner pencil and blend it to create a smoky effect.
Use liquid liner to define the look of the eyeliner, sweeping the line up towards the temples at the corner of the eye to create a cat eye look.
Thicken and darken eyeliner to your preference.
 Smokey eye effects are key to the Emo style.


Spread a lighter matte shade to the eyelid.
Apply black eyeliner on the outer 1/3 of the eye and a little bit into your crease. Remember you want this to look soft.
Apply the shadow on the lower lash line as well.
 Some people like to curl the eyelashes first for a feminine look and to emphasize the eyes.


Put the mascara on thicker on the upper lashes and go lighter on the lower lashes.
Some people prefer to use false eyelashes for an even more extreme look.
 Choose a natural shade that won't distract from the eyes.


Avoid black lipstick, dark red, or bright colors.
Keep the lips extremely subtle.
Don't use a lip liner as this will attract attention away from your carefully done eye makeup.

 If your oven doesn’t have this, simply turn the oven to bake at the highest temperature possible and leave it on for about an hour.


After the oven is cool, remove the racks and cover all surfaces with oven cleaner; use the whole can if you need to, it will be easier to clean, and you probably won’t use the cleaner again until next semester anyway.
Shut the oven door and leave the room while the fumes disperse, let the cleaner sit for a few minutes and then go back to wipe out the oven. Most of the black stuff that has been covering your oven all semester should come off pretty easy.

 Clear everything off the counter, smother them in soft scrub then rinse those babies until they sparkle.
 Those scrubbing bubbles can work as hard as they can, but it still won’t get it as clean as a bleach based cleaner, cover the entire tub in soft scrub and then leave the room and do something else. Come back 15 or 20 minutes later and spray the tub down.
 This will get rid of all your water spots, but make sure to do this step last.
 The best trick for mirrors is warm water and circles. Use a clean, soft cloth damp with warm water, scrub in circles and follow immediately with a dry towel, presto—you can see yourself in your mirror again.

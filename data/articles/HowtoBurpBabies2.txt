 As you do this, be sure to support your baby's head and neck.If you so choose, place a burp cloth over your and your baby's thighs to catch any spit.


Support your baby's front chest with your hands and their neck and head with your fingers. This will make sure that your baby is in a secure position and their upper extremities are supported at all times.
 There are several ways you can try to elicit a burp from your baby, although it might take several minutes until they need to. They include:


Patting. Pat very lightly, using mostly wrist action, not the full force of your arm.
Rubbing. Rub using circular motions.
Bouncing. Lightly bounce your baby making sure that his or her neck is fully supported.
 Your baby may struggle to burp once, or may burp several times in the course of a feeding. It all depends on their individual constitutions.

 Mix in the sugar and salt and whisk until these ingredients dissolve. After they have dissolved, add the pepper and garlic. The pepper, garlic, and salt are optional. Whisk the mixture until it is blended.If you are using a high quality balsamic vinegar, rather than a cheaper version, you will most likely not need to add the sugar. Once you have mixed in the salt, pepper, and garlic, taste the mixture. Add sugar if so desired.
 To help the vinegar and oil fuse together, keep whisking while you add a few drops of oil at a time. Once you have added all of the required oil, keep whisking for a few more moments to make sure that the ingredients are blended. Taste the vinaigrette and add more seasonings if you want to.Add other ingredients if desired. Some recipes call for adding a dollop of grainy mustard, some chopped herbs, or minced shallots or onions. Feel free to experiment with your dressing.
 Do this right before you eat so that the salad does not get soggy. If you are not planning on using the vinaigrette right away, pour it into a container with a lid. When you are ready to use it, whisk it again as the ingredients will separate while the dressing sits in the fridge.

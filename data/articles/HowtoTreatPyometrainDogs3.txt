 There are a few, rare cases, where operating on your dog is an unacceptable risk. Such cases include dogs known to have blood clotting problems. If clotting is impaired there is a great risk of fatal intraoperative hemorrhage. The veterinarian needs to weigh up the risks and benefits. If the dog is highly likely to die during surgery then treatment through medication should be discussed.


Giving drugs to your dog that cause the uterus to contract and push the pus out is a controversial treatment and not all veterinarians are prepared to offer this service. There is a chance that the dogâ€™s uterus will rupture if the womb contracts against a closed cervix.
 Available in the UK, (but not currently in the US) Aglepristone (Alizin) is labeled for pregnancy termination in dogs. It is a progesterone blocker, thus it deprives the womb of what it needs to maintain the pregnancy. The same logic applies to a pyometra. The womb simply relaxes and releases its purulent burden.


Treatment is comprised of two injections given under the skin, 24 hours apart. Aglepristone causes the cervix to relax, so there is less risk of uterine rupture than with other medications.
 Dinoprost (Lutalyse) is a drug that causes abortion in small animals, causing the uterus to lose its contents. Lutalyse is a large animal drug and its use in dogs is off license, which adds to the reluctance of many veterinarians to use it.


It is given by injection under the skin, and experimental data says it should only be given to healthy dogs under the age of six, which limits its usefulness for pyometra. The injection also causes pain at the injection site, and a few hours after the injection your dog may vomit, trembles, salivate heavily, and show signs of restlessness consistent with abdominal pain.

 Clamp a straightedge guide to the door and make a lengthwise cut using a 40-tooth carbide blade.Don’t exceed 9 inches (22.9 cm) wide or you’ll start to weaken the cantilever strength of the shelf.
 Measure the space between the outer veneers of the door. This measurement will tell you how thick to cut your cleats. They should be as long as the inside of the door.
 Use a stud finder to mark the locations of the studs, marking these with a strip of masking tape.
 Hold the cleat straight against the line on the wall. Drill into the stud with a 1/8-in. bit and install a 1/4-in. x 3-1/2 in. lag screw into each stud.Make sure the screw is tight and straight.
, The blank should fit over the cleat. If the shelf doesn't lay tight against the wall, use a block plane or sander along the back edge.
 Slide the shelf over the cleat. If you want the shelf to be permanently mounted, glue together the top of the cleat and the inside bottom edge of the door blank.
 Start at the middle, using a square as a guide, and work your way to each end.Use 1-inch brad nails spaced 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart.Nail the bottom as well. If you wish for the shelf to be removable (and didn't apply glue), use counter-sunk screws instead of brads. Install them from the top and use a small sticker to cover the heads. The paint used on the shelf can be used to touch up the stickers to match.

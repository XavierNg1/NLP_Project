 Pull some leaves off a tree. It’s up to you if you want to use live, green leaves or fake leaves off of a decorative plant. Don’t use dead leaves because they are too brittle. Use a paint pen to write the names on the leaves. Use a safety pin to attach the leaves to clothing, backpacks, or other objects.If you use live leaves, the name tags will only last a day or two. Fake leaves will last indefinitely.
Choose large leaves or small leaves depending on your preference.
 Grab some thin rectangles of wood at a craft store or hardware store. Buy chalkboard paint from a craft store or home improvement store. Paint the wood pieces and let them dry. Once they dry, use white or multicolored chalk to write the names. Use hot glue to attach a safety pin to the back.For events, set chalk out so that people can write their own names on their name tag.
If you can’t find wood pieces, look for chalkboard paper that could be cut. Another option is to cut squares of sturdy plastic or cardstock and paint them with chalkboard paint.
 Buy a bag of alphabet beads at a craft store or big-box store. Also get some safety pins with a single curve as opposed to a spiral-curved end. Place the letters on the pin in order and pin it to your shirt or other objects.

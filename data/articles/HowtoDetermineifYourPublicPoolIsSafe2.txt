 Germs in pool water can be spread to your eyes, which can cause eye irritations and infections. When you are at the public pool, avoid opening your eyes while you are underwater. Tell your children to also keep their eyes closed when they are under water.


If you want to be able to see underwater, use goggles at the pool to protect your eyes from the contaminated water., Water born illnesses can be spread by swallowing pool water. When you are at the pool, make sure you avoid swallowing any of the pool water. This is true for putting your fingers in your mouth after you have gotten out of the pool when you are still wet or before you have had a chance to shower off the pool water.


Make sure you keep your children's hands out of their mouths as well so they do not get sick.
 Every hour or so, you and your family should take a break from being in the pool. This will give all of you time to go to the restroom, stay hydrated, and rest a little before getting back in.


You should also reapply sunscreen when you are out, since most sunscreens will get washed away after continued exposure to water.

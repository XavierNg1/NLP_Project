 Instead of using primer, foundation and a concealer to prep your face, use a tinted moisturizer. A tinted moisturizer will provide the coverage you need without having to apply so many layers.Additionally, moisturizers that contain a hydration-based lotion are as effective as primers at helping your makeup stay put in humid weather.
Alternatively, you can apply a primer after using a regular, un-tinted moisturizer.
 If you need extra coverage, then apply concealer over your tinted moisturizer or primer. Use a small brush or your finger to dab a small amount of concealer on dark or red spots., If you must apply foundation, then try to only apply light layers. Dab a small amount of foundation on your T-zone, as well as other areas of your face that need coverage.If you use foundation, then remember to set your look with a translucent powder or mist.
Beauty blender sponges work great for applying light layers of sheer foundation.

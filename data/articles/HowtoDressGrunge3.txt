 Like the clothing style, your hair doesn’t need to be anything fancy. Most grungers are known for their long, tangled locks that may or may not be a bit greasy (another part of the grunge style is not caring too much about hygiene.) Let your hair do whatever it wants., As stated above, many grungers let their hair do what it wants. This means not getting it cut and letting curl or fall straight, depending on what’s natural for your head. Go to any grunge show and you’ll be sure to notice that both guys and girls have long hair.
 Some grungers prefer a bleached or dyed look. Go wild and try new colors, or leave your hair bleached blonde-ish white. When your natural color starts growing out, you don’t need to rush to redye your roots. Believe it or not, grown-out dyed hair is a definite characteristic of the grunge scene.



Consider dyeing your hair with Kool-Aid for a grungier look. Doing this will also save you money on fancier hair dyes.
 If you decide you want to wear makeup, go for black eyeliner and mascara. Smudge your makeup after you’ve applied it. You should be going for a I-spend-all-night-at-an-underground-grunge-show-dancing-my-face-off sort of look. This means smudging that eyeliner and eyeshadow.


Some grungers like to rock bright red or dark maroon lipstick.

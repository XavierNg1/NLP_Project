 Take a piece of aluminum foil, about 8-10 inches long, and fold it lengthwise multiple times so you have a thick, folded strip of foil.









The added layers of the aluminum foil will help sharpen the blades of the scissors multiple times with every cut of the foil.
 Cut strips of the aluminum foil with your scissors until you have cut the entirety of the thick aluminum strip. Use full scissor strokes, cutting beginning at the base of the scissors and extending to the tip.









Depending on the width of the strips you cut, you can sharpen your scissors blades a lot (by cutting many, skinny strips) or just a little bit (by cutting a few, thicker strips).
 Wipe down the blades using a paper towel dampened by warm water. This will get rid of any aluminum debris that may have clung to the blades as you were cutting.

If you are still letting the cars live in the garage, try to create a barrier between your study space and the cars, such as a movable wall partition, a concertina sliding and folding accordion room divider, or opaque glass wall sliding screens. That way, you will maintain your privacy and sense of homeliness at nighttime when the cars will usually be inside the garage.

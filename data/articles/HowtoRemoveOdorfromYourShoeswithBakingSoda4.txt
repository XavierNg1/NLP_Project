 If you don't want to make a mess on your floor, place your shoes down on a tray or sheet of newspaper first. Cover the insoles with a thick layer of baking soda, and wait 24 hours. Once the time is up, shake the baking soda off of the shoes. If there is any residue, you can either vacuum it up, or wipe it off with a damp cloth., Place the sandals into the bag first, then add the baking soda. Tie the bag shut tightly, and shake it. Leave the shoes in the bag for 24 to 48 hours, then take the sandals out. Shake off any excess baking soda.This method may be safe to use on leather sandals, but it is best used sparingly. If you use it too often, your sandals may become dry and brittle.
You can also use a large, plastic, zippered bag insteadâ€”as long as your sandals can fit comfortably inside.
 This will not only scrub any dirt away, but also help deodorize them as well. In a small dish, combine some baking soda with enough water to make a paste. Scrub the paste into the flip flops using an old toothbrush. Wait 5 minutes, then rinse them clean with fresh water. Let them air dry before wearing them again.You can also use an old manicure brush instead.
If the flip flops still smell, repeat the process, but with salted water instead.Salt has natural deodorizing properties.You can also use Epsom salt instead, which is good for neutralizing bad odors., Fill a small, plastic tub with one part baking soda and 10 parts water. Stir it to combine, then add the flip flops. Leave the flip flops in the water for at least 12 hours; 24 to 48 hours would be better. Once the time is up, take the flip flops out, and let them air dry.This method may be used on sandals, as long as they can be soaked or washed.
If the flip flops won't stay down, weigh them down using heavy jars or rocks.
If you are using a shallow tray, place the flip flops face-down; most of the smell is in the insoles.

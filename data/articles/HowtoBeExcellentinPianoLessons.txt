 Being excellent in piano lessons, stems from being an excellent pianist in general. Practice your scales and pieces well, and make sure you know them.;
, For example, if your piano teacher says that you will take a new piece next week, then work on playing it until you know it perfectly, this will make the lessons smoother, and you can focus on working on your mistakes rather than practicing the piece. It's almost like preparing for a lesson at school beforehand: Scan, read, underline, make notes, and learn from mistakes.
 Search for the piece on the Internet by watching videos of people playing, or songs to listen to and download.
 After you have listened to the piece, play along with it after you have experimented with the keys and have learnt to play properly and according to the time signature.
 This is not meant to be in general, practice is the main key. But perhaps your teacher could give you tips concerning you in particular, or things that you could work on.
 Complications in fingering, confusion of the time signature, a bad habit that's hard to get out of, are all things that tend to happen more than once. Work on solving these before they become a real dilemma!

, More importantly someone who is more advanced, or who can at least play the piece more fluently than you can. They can point out mistakes before your next piano session.
 If you are preparing a piece to be excellent in your lesson, then you don't have to play it fast when you're on your own! Your piano teacher won't expect you to play excellently from the first time, so you shouldn't show off and try to impress - this can have an opposite effect!

 Vitamin C contains an acid that is capable of breaking down the chemical composition of hair dye. This method will lighten your hair 1 to 2 shades. Treating your dyed hair with a vitamin C powder infused shampoo will fade the color. If you donâ€™t have a powdered form of vitamin C, crush or grind vitamin C tablets into a fine powder.


Place approximately 1,000 mg of vitamin C tablets into a sealed plastic bag.
Use a rolling pin to crush the tablets into a fine powder.;
, Open the baggie and pour the vitamin C powder into a small bowl. Cover the powder with a generous amount of clarifying shampoo. Stir the shampoo and powder together until it forms a frothy mixture.


You may add a few squirts of dish soap to the solution., Run your hair under warm water. Squeeze the excess water from your hair with a towel. Systematically coat each strand of your damp hair with the vitamin C-shampoo mix. When your tresses are covered from root to tip, put on a shower cap and place an old towel over your shoulders. Let the mixture sit for several hours.


You may distribute the mixture through your hair with a wide toothed comb.
If your scalp begins to burn, rinse out the product immediately., After a few hours, remove the shower cap from your head. Rinse your hair under warm water to wash away the mixture and the hair dye. Apply a moisturizing conditioner to your locks.


Repeat this as needed.

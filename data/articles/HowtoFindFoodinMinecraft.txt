 Animals are the easiest source of food in Minecraft; you can get meat from pigs, chickens, cows, sheep, and rabbits. Use a sword so they will be killed after a few strikes.;
, Villages usually have multiple fields full of wheat, carrots, and potatoes. Carrots and potatoes can be eaten raw, though a baked potato will fill your hunger bar more. (Use a furnace to bake a potato.) Wheat needs to be made into bread using a crafting table.


Villages aren't overly common and only appear in grasslands and deserts, although they sometimes overlap another biome if near a border. Make sure you limit your search to these biomes.
If there is a blacksmith's shop, you will find a chest inside, which can contain food, armor, diamonds, and other useful things.
 Zombies drop rotten flesh and spiders drop spider's eyes, both of which can be consumed by the player. However, spider's eyes will poison you, causing you to lose an amount of health, so only eat them when your health bar is full or nearly full. Zombie flesh will most likely give you the Hunger status effect for a time. However, both of these can be cured by drinking milk (which can be acquired from a cow using a bucket).


A spider might also drop thread, which can be used to craft a fishing rod. Fishing takes a while, but can give you a steady supply of food.
 Melons are a good source of food in jungle biomes. Cocoa beans can be made into cookies, but only if you have wheat as well.
 There is a chance that an oak leaf, when broken, will drop an apple, which can be eaten. This method is a bit iffy, as there is no guarantee any given oak tree will contain an apple.

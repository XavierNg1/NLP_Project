 If you're not used to cooking fish at home, or you want to try out a new method, review the basic instructions so you know what temperature and cooking times are necessary. Fish is often grilled, baked, poached, or sautéed.
 Different types of fish have different flavors and textures, so recipes often specify an exact type. Learn about cooking halibut, snapper, grouper, flounder, tilapia, or salmon.


Remember that cooking frozen fish without thawing will typically take twice as long as the recipe calls for.
 Unlike red meat, most fish picks up on flavoring after only 5–15 minutes of marination. This makes it easy to season and flavor even if cooking it from frozen. Make sweet and sour fillets, fish in cheese sauce, Cajun style blackened fish, or Mexican style fish for tacos.
 Some recipes call for less typical methods of preparing fish. These don't have to be difficult with the right instructions, and usually just involve cooking the fish along with other ingredients. Try cooking chowder, fish quiche, battered fish & chips, or kedgeree.

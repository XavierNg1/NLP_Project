 This length of time in the microwave depends on the strength of your microwave. You want the mozzarella and cream cheese to become soft and malleable, which typically takes about thirty seconds. If you’ve never made this before, keep an eye on the cheeses and take it out when they’ve softened enough.While you are doing this, preheat your oven to 425 degrees, or 220 degrees Celsius, so it can warm while you create the crust.
 Blend everything together in your mixing bowl using a rubber spatula, until it’s reached a dough-like consistency. Once everything is mixed up completely, roll it into a large ball., Again, it’s imperative that you line your baking sheet with parchment paper so that it doesn’t stick. If you use foil, you run the risk of your crust sticking and being ruined. Press the dough into your desired shape.Once your dough is rolled out, spray it with olive oil or coconut oil and add a sprinkle of garlic salt.
 Before you pop it into the oven, use a fork to pierce holes along the surface to prevent it from bubbling and rising. Put it in the oven for eight to ten minutes, but keep an eye on it. If bubbles start forming, pierce more holes into the dough. As soon as it becomes a golden brown, remove it from the oven.Be careful not to overcook and dry out your crust. If you’ve never made this before, start with the minimum cooking time.
 Before you go nuts topping your pizza, increase the temperature on the oven to 450 degrees, or 230 degrees Celsius. Then, start making the pizza your own. Add cheese and meats, or create a vegetarian pizza. Add whatever you want! Pop it back in the oven for four to give minutes, and voila! You’ve created an easy and delicious, low carb pizza.

 Begin creating the orange twists by cutting off the bottom of the orange and placing it on a cutting board. Use a paring knife to begin making a slice into the orange in a downward motion at the top of the fruit. Make sure the cut is shallow so it doesnâ€™t cut through to the meat of the orange. Keep making the slice in a long continuous strip, moving the paring knife around the orange to cut the rind in a loop. Stop cutting when you reach the bottom of the orange.Cut as many orange twists as you want centerpieces. You will likely need a new orange for each twist.
 Once you have finished making the twists, fill a standard sized clear Mason jar, about the size of a juice glass, with water until about an inch (2.54 cm) below the rim of the jar. This will be the base for the floating candle., Place the orange twist into the water of the Mason jar, then add any attractive herbs or decorations you would like.

Herbs like rosemary sprigs and cinnamon sticks add color and texture to the centerpiece.
You can be creative and add any decorations that you wish, even things like marbles or pebbles.
 Once you have finished adding the orange rind and other decorative elements to the water, place a small floating candle on top of the water.You can get floating candles at standard department stores or at art supply stores.
 When you are ready to display the centerpieces, place them on the table as you wish. Sprinkle sprigs of herbs or flowers around the base of the Mason jars, then light the candles and enjoy your dinner or event by the soft light of these beautiful centerpieces.

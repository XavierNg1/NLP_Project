Bone broth is a great way to make use of kitchen “waste”–onion skins, garlic skins, ends of carrots, potato peelings. If you’re making broth weekly, you can store these in the fridge. Otherwise, freeze them for later use. Whole cloves of garlic, halved onions, halved potatoes all add flavor to your broth.
 Let sit for an hour.

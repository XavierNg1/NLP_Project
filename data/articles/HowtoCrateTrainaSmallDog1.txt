 Plastic crates are generally more appropriately-sized for your small dog than larger, metal crates; dogs under 38 lbs. should have crates sized 24" by 24" or smaller. Successful crate training requires that your dog instinctively avoid soiling its sleeping area; the crate should not be big enough for your dog to use one end as a bathroom. Make sure the crate is large enough for your small dog to stand up straight, turn around, and lie down comfortably., The psychology of crate training works with a dog's instinctive desire to have a warm, safe place to sleep. Make your pet comfortable in their crate by placing a soft bed or blankets inside of it. If your small dog is not housebroken, line the crate with thick, comfortable towels that can be easily removed and washed., Put the crate in a central location in your house where your dog will be able to see what is going on around it. It is important for your dog to have positive associations with its crate and see it as a refuge, rather than a source of isolation. While dogs may enjoy their den-like retreat, they are largely energetic and social animals who require mental stimulation and companionship.

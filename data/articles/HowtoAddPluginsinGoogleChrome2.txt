 For example, to watch trailers on http://trailers.apple.com/, you will need the QuickTime plug-in.
 When the web page being loaded detects that it needs a certain plug-in to run a content, it will check if Google Chrome has the required plug-in. If it does not, a prompt will appear at the top part of the page.
 Click on the button that states “Install plug-in” or “Update plug-in.” The plug-in will be downloaded for Google Chrome and installed.


Some plug-ins may require you to download and install a setup file.
 Once the installation is completed, close all open windows and exit Google Chrome. Restart it to ensure that the plug-in has been properly installed. You can now go back to the website to see the web content supported by the plug-in.

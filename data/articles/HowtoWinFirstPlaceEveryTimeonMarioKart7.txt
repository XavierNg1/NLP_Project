 You don't have to know everything just things like there are rocks that you must avoid.;
, The passages you find can then be used in the grand prix. You can also find them in the grand prix but it's easier in time trial because no one can stop you.
 Also as soon as your kart is in the air, press R on the back of your 3DS for a boost when you land. Do this before you glide as well for a higher and longer glide.
 If GO! comes up, then you'll boost out of the starting line.
 Keep a controlled drift by using the control stick. When your kart starts giving off blue sparks, if you stop drifting you get a short boost. If you keep drifting for longer then you may get red sparks, you get a longer boost.

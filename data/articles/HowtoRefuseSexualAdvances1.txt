 This can lead to more advances and hurt feelings.


Say, “I enjoy having you as a friend, but I’m not interested in a romantic relationship.”
Don’t add conditions to the no. For example, don’t say, “I’m already seeing someone.”;
, Your body language is important because making the wrong moves can undermine your refusal. Avoid the temptation to comfort the person with a hug, touching, or sitting close together. Instead, create space between you, cross your arms over your body, and keep your facial expression serious.You may need to leave, especially if you two are in an intimate setting.
 You don’t have to explain your choices, so state your refusal and then leave it alone.If the person presses you, say, “I’ve already said I’m not interested.”


Never apologize for how you feel.
Don’t engage in a conversation with them if they are trying to convince you to change your mind.
 It might feel easier to tell them that things might go differently if you were single, if the situation were different, or if you didn’t have something else to do, but this will only make the situation worse. They will think that there is still a chance and that you really are interested.For example, don’t say, “Maybe if there weren’t so many people at this party,” or “I have to get up early tomorrow.”
Instead, say, “I’m not interested in sex.”

, If they ask again or want to talk about why you said no, firmly repeat your refusal and walk away. Don’t engage in any other conversations with them.Tell your other friends if you feel uncomfortable or afraid.
 If a friend disrespects you and your choices, then they aren’t a real friend. You may need to drop a friend who has pressured you to have sex or continues to make advances after you have stated your desire not to engage in those behaviors with them.

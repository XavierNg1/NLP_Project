 One may fall in the pool or get dirty, and you don't want to rub dirt all over yourself. Even if nothing like that happens, it never hurts to have a spare. A friend may have forgotten to bring one, and you could loan them yours.
 You don't want to go to the pool all day and end up bright red the next day. If you want to tan, try bringing a lower SPF, like 15. If you burn easily, you may want to get a higher SPF, such as 50. If you need it, they do make SPF 100.

 Bring a cooler with water, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and other healthy snacks. Unhealthy snacks may taste good, but they won't fuel your body as long or fill your stomach enough. It also may be a good idea to bring Gatorade or "Powerade", as these energize you and replace your electrolytes.
, If you are a child, it will give you something to do during adult swim. Also, you could read on a bench and tan while you read.
 You don't want to have your eyes be damaged by the sunlight, and the hat protects your face more.

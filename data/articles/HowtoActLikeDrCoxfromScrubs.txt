 If someone asks you a question, don't just say 'yes,' 'no,' or 'maybe.' Respond creatively. For example, list off the reasons why you would not do something.;
, For instance, if you're a doctor like he is, make sure you do your best for each and every patient. If you work at a fast food restaurant, then do that to the best of your ability, even if you don't like it.
 But show it on extremely rare occasions. If something really bad happens then show it's affected you. After all, you are a human.
 They don't necessarily have to be insulting. Dr. Cox calls Turk 'Ghandi,' Elliot 'Barbie,' and JD 'Newbie.' If you call someone a nickname, stick with it. When all out of ideas, call a guy demeaning girl's names.
 If something or someone goes against them, then make it known loud and clear. Stand by your convictions. Don't let greed influence your decisions, and don't let authority decide what's right or wrong for you.
, If done right, they will have no choice but to look at you as you make your exit.
 Dr. Cox will frequently change his pitch when making fun of someone. Also, learn to whistle. Dr. Cox tends to whistle in the middle of words. While not needed for everything you say, many will be needed to emphasis.
, (Examples would be: Having fallen asleep at the start, wondering about when the fairy queen is going to get her daughter back etc.) Afterwards, make your way out of the conversation. Do not linger. Pay extra attention to the pitch of your voice when you are doing this, change it appropriately for added effect.
 E.G. "Re-he-he-he-he-he-HEEEEEEally there Judy?" (Almost) always combine this with changing your voice pitch.

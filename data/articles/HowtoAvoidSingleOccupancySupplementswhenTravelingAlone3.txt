 If you are joining a tour or cruise, you should ask them if they can pair you with a roommate. Some operators may offer this service up front while others will be glad to help you if you ask.You can say, “I would like to avoid the single supplement rate, and I was wondering if you could pair me with another solo traveler to be my roommate.”
Be sure to specify if you want to share a room with someone of the same sex.
You may not be able to find someone who is the same age or has the same sleeping patterns as you.
 Some websites will help match you to strangers who are also traveling alone. These websites will let you post a request for a travel partner or group. You can specify that you want a roommate, and they will find one who pairs well with you.Travel Chum and Connecting Solo Travel Network both offer this service to members.
Be extremely careful when finding roommates online. You never know who the other person might be. Ask the other person if you can video chat first so that you can make sure they are who they say they are. While sharing a room, keep your possessions locked safely in your luggage or in a locker.
 If you’re not having luck with specific roommate matching services, you can try posting on a general travel or destination-specific message board. While there is a little more risk to this, you may still be able to find someone who can share a room with you. You should state in your post what type of roommate you’re looking for, when you’re traveling, and where you want to stay.For example, you might post, “I will be traveling to London between June 1 and 7, and I would like a roommate. I will be staying in the West End and would prefer a male roommate.”

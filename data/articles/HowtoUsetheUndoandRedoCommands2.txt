 This is a useful option if you've typed in something you'd like to undo, or accidentally deleted something you'd like to bring back. There are two ways to do this:


Press Command + Z to undo an action. If you want to redo an action, press Command + Shift + Z.
Click "Edit" and then "Undo" or "Redo." This will perform the same action. You can find the "Edit" option on the top right of the toolbar.
 These programs include Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft Powerpoint. There are three ways to do this:


Press Command + Z to undo an action and press Command + Y to redo an action.
Click "Edit" and then select "Undo" to undo and "Repeat" to redo. You can find this option on the top left of the toolbar.
Press the "Undo" or "Redo" buttons. The "Undo" button will look like an orange arrow pointing to the left and the "Redo" button will look like a blue arrow pointing to the right. You can find them next to each other on the top of the toolbar.
 Though some of the above options may also work in a variety of other programs, if you've opened another program, just click on "Edit" on the top of the toolbar and see the key codes that are listed to the right of the "Undo" and "Redo" options. This will tell you which keys to press to undo and redo your actions.


Note that unfortunately, not every action can be redone or undone. If you're pressing the correct buttons and it's not working, then you've done one of these actions.

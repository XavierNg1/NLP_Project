 Put on round glasses when you're birdwatching and substitute them for binoculars. Add a leaf necklace. Just stay away from flashy clothes; try dressing in natural, simplistic clothing.;
, Try to go to Sarepia Forest, Appondale, Kimbara Outback, or even your den. Try to gather as many friends as you can, watch the birds with binoculars and have fun!


If you go to Sarepia Forest to birdwatch, then hide in caves and bushes so you don't scare the birds away.
 If you go to Appondale, roll in mud then hide in the mini tree by the mud pit.
 If you go to Kimbara Outback, hide in the bushes by the river.
If you decide to birdwatch in your den, add a ton of trees, vines, waterfalls, and your den as your shelter. Decorate your den with vines from the Sarepia Forest, some flowers, a Tiki Umbrella Table, and much more! Add some trees at the bottom of your den, hide the roots so they look like bushes, you can bird watch that way!

, Once they're there, tell them, "We are going to birdwatch in (insert birdwatching place here)." Only invite a few friends; it's hard to be stealthy and quiet in a large group.

 There is no browser bar on the Chrome mobile browser.To view your bookmarks, touch the menu button, then select Bookmarks.
 Touch and hold the bookmark you want to move. Once it's highlighted, select any other bookmarks you are also moving. Touch the icon in the top right corner with a picture of a folder and an arrow. Select the folder where you would like to move the selected bookmarks., As long as you use the same Google account for each device's Chrome app, you can have the bookmarks sync automatically between them. Here's a quick guide:In Chrome, select the menu icon, then Settings.
On mobile devices, touch your account name, then touch "Sync is on" to access Sync settings. If you only want to sync some data, switch to "Sync Everything OFF" and check the boxes next to the data you want to share between devices.
On a computer, instead click "Advanced sync settings" on the settings menu.
Repeat for each device you want synced.
 If you prefer a list view to the default icon presentation, try the following:Navigate to chrome://flags/#enable-new-ntp in your Chrome mobile browser.
Change "Default" to "Enabled"
Scroll to the bottom of the screen and hit "Relaunch now" to restart your browser and make the change.
Note: All the options on this "flags" page are experimental. Options change and disappear frequently. If there is no "enable new ntp" option in your version of Chrome, this step is not possible.

 Suck in your cheeks and lips to form a “fish face” with your lips. Smile while holding the posture for 5 seconds. Relax and repeat between 15 and 20 times for best results.
 Maneuver your face and jaw to silently pronounce the alphabet letters “X” and “O.” Pronounce them slowly and deliberately to exercise the jaws, cheeks and neck muscles.


This exercise can be performed whenever you have spare time, such as in the car or while watching television.
 Start in a sitting position. Smile as wide as you can and use your hands to lift your cheeks toward your eyes. You should feel a slight stretch and strain in your cheek muscles. Hold the posture for 15 seconds and then relax. Repeat 15 times for best results.
 Sit on a chair with your spine straight and tilt your head back so that you face the ceiling. Pucker your lips and blow air from your mouth for between 5 and 10 seconds before relaxing. Repeat 15 to 20 times for best results.
 Fill up one of your cheeks with air. Transfer the air from one cheek to another as you would when swishing mouthwash. Perform this for 1 minute and then relax. Repeat 5 to 10 times for best results.


While there is no evidence that facial exercises can thin your cheeks, such exercises may help tighten facial muscles, giving a more defined look.

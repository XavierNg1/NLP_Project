 Sometimes, the doctor's office you visit may have assistance for people who can't afford a medication. If it's your child who needs the EpiPen, you may have better luck asking at a children's hospital., Most companies want their employees to be happy and healthy. If you talk to your employer about needing an EpiPen, they may be willing to help if your insurance doesn't cover it.

When buying directly from the company, you cut out distributors and pharmacies, which can reduce your cost.

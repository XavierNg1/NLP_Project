 If you have a nail polish liner pen, then you can easily create a diamond design on your nails. Start by drawing a few diagonal lines going across each of your nails. Then, cross back over the lines going in the opposite direction to create diamond shapes on your nails. Fill in every other row to turn your criss-crossing diagonal lines into diamonds.Adding diamonds will help to give your nails a harlequin look, which is a popular theme for Mardi Gras.
You can use a black nail liner pen to create diamonds, or you can use a different color, to accent your nail polish.
You can also try drawing diamonds free hand, but using diagonal lines may provide a more symmetrical design.
 Accenting your nails is optional, but it can add some extra dimension to your nail look. You can accent your nails with nail crystals, decals, or some nail art if you are up to it.


For example, you could accent purple and gold nails with some gold nail crystals or sequins. Or, you could choose one nail to accent with a special design, such as a mask or some feathers.

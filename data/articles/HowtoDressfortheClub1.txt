 Take a shower, shave, and apply hair gel or your hair styling trick of choice. Though the club can get sweaty and hot, it’s best to start the night off with a clean look.;
, If you’re heading to a more laid back club, loosen up your collar or opt for jeans instead of slacks. But if you’re heading to a more upscale club, dress more formally. When in doubt, do an online search of the club to read up on their expected dress code. Outfit ideas include:


A nice, well tailored button down collared shirt. Avoid golf shirts or generic corporate looking shirts (blue stripes, checks, ‘boardroom blue’).And don’t forget to tuck in your shirt!Jeans that fit. Baggy jeans are so 90s, and not in a good way. Opt for a nice pair of jeans that fit you well and hug, rather than hang, on you.
A pair of loafers or oxfords. Look for shoes made of polished leather, but avoid pointy toes or square toed shoes, as these styles aren’t considered stylish.Avoid athletic wear or athletic shoes. Though not all clubs have very formal dress codes, most clubs will not allow anyone wearing athletic shoes or athletic wear to get past the doormen. So, leave the gym wear at home.
 Though black is usually seen as the safe and sophisticated option, clubs are usually covered in black light bulbs that can show off dandruff, lint, etc on black.Blue and dark gray are good alternatives to black, and hide sweat lines well.
 It’s a good idea to wear a coat that can survive the hot atmosphere of the club, like a lightweight blazer or a thin leather jacket, so you can skip the long coat check line.

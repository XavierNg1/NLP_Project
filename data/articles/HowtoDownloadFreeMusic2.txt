 A growing trend in digital music is the use of music streaming websites. Some of the more popular sites are BandCamp and SoundCloud. These sites let artists upload music which visitors can stream and sometimes download.


Not every song on SoundCloud and BandCamp can be downloaded for free. Oftentimes, new releases will have a limited number of free downloads available before you have to purchase the track.
PureVolume offers many free downloads. When you select an album, click the Free MP3 link to download the songs.
NoiseTrade is a music community where artists upload music for fans to download for free. All of the music is completely legal to download.
Last.fm offers lots of free music from a variety of artists.
 You can search by artist or song name, or browse through genres of music looking for new tracks. These sites often feature remixes of popular songs that can be downloaded or streamed for free.


Many artists are starting to release singles and early tracks on sites such as these for free.
 There are several websites that will allow you to enter in the URL of a SoundCloud song and it will convert it into an MP3 file that you can download. Be aware that performing this is against the Terms and Conditions of using SoundCloud.

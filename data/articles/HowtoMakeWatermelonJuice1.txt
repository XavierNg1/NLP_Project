1 seedless watermelon
Powdered sugar or honey to taste
Cold water and ice cubes;
, Peel the watermelon and slice it into 1" (2.5 cm) chunks using a sharp knife.
 Use a fork instead of using your hands to prevent messiness.
 Add powdered sugar or honey, if desired.


Blend your watermelon chunks and sweetener and check the consistency.
Add water for thinner juice and add ice cubes for thicker juice.

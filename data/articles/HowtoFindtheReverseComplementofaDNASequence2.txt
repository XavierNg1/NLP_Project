 This article assumes that the input is in FASTA format, with a single sequence per file. The following steps also assume that all nucleotides are ATGC bases., For FASTA format:

Discard the first line of the file.
Remove all remaining newlines and other trailing whitespace.





def init(sequence):
    with open(argv) as input:
        sequence = "".join(])
    return sequence




,




complement = {'A': 'T', 'C': 'G', 'G': 'C', 'T': 'A'}




, Reverse the resulting vector.




def reverse_complement(seq):
    bases = for base in seq]
    bases = reversed(bases)
    return bases




,




result = reverse_complement(seq)
print ''.join(result)

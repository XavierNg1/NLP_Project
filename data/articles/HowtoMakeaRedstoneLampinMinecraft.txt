 You'll need this to make redstone dust for the lamp.;
,, (Place the glowstone dust 2 x 2 in the crafting table.)

, Arrange as follows:


Place the glowstone block in the center of the crafting table.
Place one redstone dust above and one below the glowstone block and one to each side. (This leaves the four outer corners of the crafting table empty.)

,, It will attach to that spot.


You can create various impressive arrangements with redstone lamps, such as glowing ceilings, rows along a wall and lit-up floors.
 To do this, you have various choices, such as:


A lever (ongoing) - can be placed on top
A redstone torch (ongoing) - placed anywhere adjacent to the lamp will power the lamp (don't place on the lamp)
Button (short-lived) - can be placed on top
Tripwire (short-lived - as soon as you move off, it turns off)
Pressure plate (short-lived, as soon as you move off, it turns off) - can be placed on top
Detector rails (this can be useful for lighthouses and roller coasters).

 Before going in for the procedure, stock up on water, yogurt, applesauce, and other soft foods. Grab some magazines, books, movies, or other favorite sources of entertainment.

, Ask a friend or family member for ride home after surgery. If you've had a general anesthetic (gas sedation or sleeping pills), you are typically not legally permitted to drive. With the exception of taxis, it’s also recommended to avoid public transportation if you’ve been sedated or given an anesthetic.You may also need a ride to the pharmacy and assistance in filling any prescriptions your oral surgeon might offer immediately after surgery, such as painkillers.
 If you’ve had a tooth or teeth extracted, make sure to drink lots of water following surgery. It’s important to keep the surgical site from drying out. Do not consume any hot, carbonated, or acidic beverages, including soda, coffee, and juices.You should also avoid alcohol and milk, which can introduce bacteria (such as lactobacillus) to the surgical site.


Drinking lukewarm water can be easier and less painful.
Don’t drink through a straw for a least a week: this can dislodge clotted blood and cause bleeding or dry sockets.
 Don’t plan on doing any activities immediately following your surgery. For the rest of that day, just curl up and get some rest. While you should avoid anything strenuous for at least a week, you can typically resume normal activities within a day or two, depending on your dentist or oral surgeon’s orders.If you are experiencing persistent bleeding, sit upright and keep yourself elevated in order to avoid choking.

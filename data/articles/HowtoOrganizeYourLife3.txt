 Think of 5 things that you want to be big things in your life, such as studying, exercise, healthy eating, relaxation, working, sleep etc.
 List all the days in the month ahead down the page and across the top put the 5 things that you want your days to be split up into.
 Whether you aim to do 30 minutes of exercise every day or a whole hour. Put that above each one.
 Reward yourself with the pleasure of ticking something when you achieved your goal.
 Say to yourself if I get 100 boxes ticked then 'I will go out to the cinema with all my friends'.

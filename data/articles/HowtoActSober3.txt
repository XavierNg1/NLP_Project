 You can push your limits. If you find yourself too drunk to avoid showing your tells, practice overcoming them. You may ask your sober buddy to evaluate you. Practice acting sober while drunk until you can pull it off successfully to your sober buddy.
 Not all venues are conducive to your acting sober. Acting sober at a bar is far different than acting sober at a traffic stop or in front of angry parents. If you push your limits, you may not be able to act sober at the same rate in every scenario. When you know you are potentially moving to a new scenario, let your drunkenness wear off a little more before attempting to act sober.
 Many of these tests are designed to be increasingly difficult the more drunk you are. The novelty of these scenarios means if you are not practiced, you may find yourself too nervous to act sober.


Be sure to have a sober person evaluate you. Let them study the behaviors a law enforcement agent will be looking for. Then they can accurately tell you what you are doing wrong to the best of their ability.
 Some bodily behaviors give you away because they are unavoidable.Even when you learn to control yourself enough to act sober, your body may not act as sober as you want it to. A breathalizer test may reveal that your body has not metabolized alcohol as fast as you wished it would. The vocal cords, eye muscles, and legs may not perform the way a sober person's would. Whenever your body is acting beyond your ability to hide your drunkenness, avoid scenarios where they may give you away.


If you are pulled over by a police officer, you should submit to their requests.Refusing to perform a field sobriety test or blow into a breathalizer is generally a bad idea. By acquiring your license you may provide implicit consent. Refusing to cooperate with law enforcement may earn you additional citations.

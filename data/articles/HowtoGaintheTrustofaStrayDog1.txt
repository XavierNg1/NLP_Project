 You may feel a bit anxious, but it’s important that you appear calm at all times. Speak to them in a friendly, even voice. Move towards them in a slow, deliberate way.It may also help to make soft clicking noises with your tongue to get the dog’s attention without alarming it.;
, Only approach them if they are in an open area where the dog can clearly see you for your entire approach and has an easy escape route. If a dog feels cornered, they may lash out in fear., You don’t want to stare directly at the dog or make prolonged eye contact. Instead, keep your gaze directed to one side of the dog.It’s also good to crouch down to make yourself smaller but not to get down on your hands and knees since this puts you in a vulnerable position if the dog should attack.
 Instead of going the whole way to the dog, stop at least 10 feet short of where they are. This allows the dog to approach you on their own initiative. Stay still and crouching while not making direct eye contact. Speak to them in a calm, friendly voice to encourage them to come., If the stray shows interest by moving towards you, slowly put your hand out with your palm down for them to smell. This a way for them to greet and identify you.Do not make any sudden movements or try to pet them. Just stay still and let the stray have a good sniff.
Once they’ve had a good sniff, you can try reaching out to touch the dog. Don’t start by trying to stroke their head; instead, lightly place your hand on the side of their neck.

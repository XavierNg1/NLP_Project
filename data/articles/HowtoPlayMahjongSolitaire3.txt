 Although Mahjong Solitaire involves careful observation and a trained eye, you will maximize your success by removing your blocks in such a sequence that will open up the most pieces for you in the future. Much like chess, you should make your moves with the next potential moves you'll make taken into consideration.
 All Mahjong Solitaire games involve four layers on top of one another. Early on in the game, these layered blocks should be your priority. If there are multiple potential combinations, you should choose the ones that will remove these layers. This will free up the most blocks for you later on in the game, and possibly avert a failed game towards the end., If you're playing a version of the game that involves blocks of varying scores, it's a good idea to get these high-value blocks as early as possible. If none are currently available, look for the high-value blocks that you can potentially free up with a block or two., If you can potentially remove a pair of blocks that won't open up new pairs, you should save it for a backup. Instead, concentrate on the pairs that will maximize your possibilities in future moves.
 If you're playing the game with physical pieces, there won't be any concrete indication to let you know whether there are any blocks left or not. Rather than shuffle up the pieces as soon as you're not sure, take a patient eye to your pieces and look it over again. Especially if you're a beginner to the game, chances are you'll admit defeat while there are still options available to you.

 Don't add the eggs to the water yet; it needs to be boiling first.
 Avoid dropping them into the water, or you will risk cracking them. Instead, consider using a slotted spoon, a pair of tongs, or even a wire basket.
 If the eggs are smaller, cook them for 11 minutes. If the eggs are larger, cook them for 13 minutes.
 Fill a bowl with cold water, and lots of ice. When you put the cooked eggs into the icy water, the coldness will "shock" the eggs, and make the shell easier to peel away.
 Once the time is up, use a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer the eggs from the saucepan and into the ice bath. During this time, the eggs will cool down; it is easier to peel cold eggs than hot eggs.
 Keep the ice bath nearby. You can dip the eggs into the water after you peel them to get rid of any broken shell bits.
 Tap both ends of the egg against a hard surface, then roll the egg across the surface with your palm. This will help loosen the membrane from the whites, and make the egg easier to peel.
 You may want to dip the egg into the cold water from time to time. This will loosen the shell from the whites even more, and help rinse away any broken shell pieces. 







, At this point, you can add the eggs to your recipe, or store them in a sealed container in the refrigerator. If you do store them, be sure to eat them within 3 to 5 days.

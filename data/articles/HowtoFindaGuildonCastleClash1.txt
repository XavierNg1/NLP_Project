 In order to find a guild, you need a guild hall to search for guilds in. You can find this in the shop and build it on your base.;
, There are two ways to search for a guild.


One way is to press Search Guilds. You will see different titles of the guilds that are available. Keep searching until you find a guild that is right for you.
Another way to search for a guild is to press the search button that is on top of Search Guilds. Type in the title of the guild you want to join. If you find that guild, tap Apply. A message will appear and say "You applied to join this guild!" Wait until the leader accepts you. She/he may or may not accept you, so search for another guild just in case.
You will have to know a guild name and search for it if you cannot find that guild in the first method. Also, you have to type in the exact name of the guild.
 This way, you will be able to find guilds more easily, so that if one guild doesn't accept, the other may.


You will know you have been accepted by a guild when you see the guild name on the guild hall.

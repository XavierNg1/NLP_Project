 Before you confront your friend about something like this, be patient. They could be going through a phase that will be over soon. Wait until the copying has lasted at least a month before you say anything., If your friend has a few of the same shirts as you because they liked them, is it really worth confronting them over? If the copying is very low level, you might decide instead to just table the issue for now., Are you copying a celebrity with some of the clothes you wear or things you do? Could your friend be doing so, too? Ask yourself these questions before you speak to your friend. You might find that they are not copying you, but someone else instead., Talk to a friend about the concerns you have. See if they have noticed the copying. If not, then you may overthinking things a bit. Ask them to help you to be fair and objective during this process.You might say, “John, I’ve noticed that Charly sometimes copies my ideas on and he has even bought a few of the exact same ties as me. Have you noticed anything? I wanted to check with you before I said something.”

, If the copying has become too much for you, step back from your friend for a while. Don’t ignore them, but do let them know that you need a bit of space and ask them to respect that.During this time, consider whether this issue is worth losing your friendship over.

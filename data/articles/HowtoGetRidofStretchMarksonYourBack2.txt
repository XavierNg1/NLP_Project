 Laser therapies can sometimes be performed by your general practitioner, but are often undertaken by a cosmetic surgery specialist or a dermatologist. Several types of laser therapies exist to help reduce the appearance of stretch marks.Pulse dye laser treatment is a nearly painless treatment that is best used in the early stages of a stretch mark while it is still a bright red or purple.
Fractional laser therapy is used on stretch marks that have faded or gone white. It is often more painful, as it causes controlled, intentional small injuries to the skin.
Laser therapy is generally not covered by insurance, and typically needs more than one session for effective treatment.
 Scientific studies have reported some amounts of success using microdermabrasion as a treatment for stretchmarks. You may be able to book a microdermabrasion treatment at a local spa, but for areas as large as the back it may be better to contact a dermatologist.Do not expect changes from a single microdermabrasion treatment. Those who report success with the treatment seek it at least once a week over the course of several weeks or months.
 Alternative medicine has had limited quantifiable success in helping to treat stretch marks. Visit a homeopath to speak with them about creating natural or home remedies that may help treat your stretch marks.If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, it is recommended that you speak with your doctor before using any alternative treatments.

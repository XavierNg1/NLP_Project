 When the person who wrote the check has a delinquent account, it makes telling the person trying to cash the check even more difficult. This is because you cannot divulge any financial information about the account to someone who is not on the account.
 If they ask "why," you have to tell them that you cannot divulge this type of information to them because they are not the account holder.

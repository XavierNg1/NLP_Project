 Gothic Lolita clothing is shown off to the best advantage when your posture is erect, with straight shoulders and a high head. Try walking in light, measured steps instead of shuffling or dragging your feet.
 Because Lolita style harkens back to the 19th century, try emulating the socially acceptable manners of the time period. Speak politely and crisply, without relying on contractions or slang. Do not use swear words as well. Be courteous to everyone, and acknowledge strangers or new acquaintances with a slight tip of your head or a small smile. Be confident without being rude, and courteous without being a doormat.
 Bring some old-fashioned beauty into your life by learning Victorian arts or skills, such as sewing and/or embroidering (it will help you with your clothing if you are on a budget or don't want to buy off Japan), cooking, calligraphy, painting or sketching, and collecting things like antiques or stamps.
 A Lolita lifestyle is, to a certain extent, about maintaining a childlike sense of innocence and wonder. Try seeing your life through fresh, less-jaded eyes and watch your attitude improve!

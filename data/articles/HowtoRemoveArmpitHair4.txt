 This is the easiest length to manage when it comes to using an epilator. If it's longer, it could become tangled and difficult to manage in the epilator device. It may help to shave your armpits one to two days before epilating, to make sure your hair is just the right length when you start.
 An epilator is a small machine with rotating heads that pull out the hair. Like waxing, the results can last for weeks, but the process can be a little painful.Make sure your armpits are completely dry by dusting them with baby powder. This helps ensure your skin won't get caught in the machine.
 Raise it high so that your armpit skin is very taut. If your skin is bunched, it could get pinched in the epilator.
 Using the lower setting at first will help you get used to the feeling of having your hair pulled.
 Keep it slightly away from the surface of your skin at first. As the hairs are pulled you'll feel a pinch similar to what you'd feel during waxing. Soon you'll get used to the feeling of having your hair pulled, and you'll be ready to move to the next step.
 Now you can get all the stray hairs that didn't come out the first time around. Keeping your skin taut, finish the job on the higher setting.
 Start on the lower setting first, then move to the higher setting. Continue until your armpit is completely hair free.
 Your armpits will feel red and irritated, so soothe them with aloe right when you're finished.
 Applying it right away could sting or cause a rash, so wait at least a few hours.

 Long, curling eyelashes can make you feel very feminine, but you don't need pounds of mascara to achieve this look. Instead, try using an eyelash curler to pump up the volume of your eyelashes. To use an eyelash curler:


Clamp the curler around your eyelashes and hold the contraption in place for 10 to 20 seconds.
Alternatively, you can make your eyelashes appear thicker by applying a coat of Vaseline to your lashes, and then using an eyelash brush to comb them.
You can also try using the back of a spoon to curl your eyelashes if you don’t have a curler.
 Smooth, full lips are much more attractive than dry, cracked ones, so make sure to look after yours using a combination of exfoliation and moisturization. Exfoliate your lips by gently rubbing a dampened toothbrush or washcloth against them, then hydrate them with your favorite lip balm.


Protect lips from extreme weather conditions by wearing a lip balm with an SPF in the sun, or a protective chapstick in the winter.
Alternatively, you can use Vaseline to keep your lips healthy and crack-free.
 To brighten up your eyes and give an overall impression of health and alertness, use some redness-reducing eye drops. These are readily available at your local pharmacy and are a quick and easy way to improve your appearance. Simply add a drop or two to each eye every morning for brightness and clarity.
 Adding a hint of rosy color to your cheeks can give you a healthy, radiant look. However, you don’t need blush to attain this color; you can gently pinch or tap your cheeks to bring some color to them.


Your cheeks will also naturally look for rosy if you spend time out in the sun and exercise frequently.

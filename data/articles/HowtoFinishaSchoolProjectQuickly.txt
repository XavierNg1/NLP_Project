 Researching and understanding your topic is key to creating a good project on it. Try to find out as much as you can using the internet, your textbook, class notes, library, etc. If your time is really short, browse the internet, and flip through your textbook.;
, Try creating an outline (like how you would do for a report) to organize the information into what’s important and what’s not.
 See if there are any instructions on how to present or any subtopics.
 You could create a chart or draw a map. The way you present a project depends on what subject it’s on. If you need to write a report, then write a report.
 If it’s a report, then your job is easy. If you’re drawing a map, then get a colored chart and markers. Go through the information again.
 Draw, write, and practice your presentation (if necessary).
 Practice it in front of your family, or the mirror. Try to present without holding a paper.

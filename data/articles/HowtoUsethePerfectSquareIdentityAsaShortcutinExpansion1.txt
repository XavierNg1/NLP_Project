 A binomial is a two-termed expression. If the binomial expression is a perfect square, it will be expressed as either (a+b)2{\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}} or (a+b)(a+b){\displaystyle (a+b)(a+b)}. Note the binomials could also have a subtraction symbol.

For example, (5y+3)2{\displaystyle (5y+3)^{2}} is a perfect square binomial.
;
, The formula is (a+b)2=a2+2ab+b2{\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}}. If the binomials show subtraction, the formula is (a−b)2=a2−2ab+b2{\displaystyle (a-b)^{2}=a^{2}-2ab+b^{2}}. Note that a{\displaystyle a} is the first term of the binomial, and b{\displaystyle b} is the second term of the binomial.
 This will become the first term of the trinomial. Remember that squaring a term means to multiply it by itself.

For example, if you are expanding (5y+3)2{\displaystyle (5y+3)^{2}}, you would first calculate (5y)2=25y2{\displaystyle (5y)^{2}=25y^{2}}. So, 25y2{\displaystyle 25y^{2}} is the first term of the trinomial.
 Make sure you are using the original a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} terms from the binomial expression.

For example, if you are expanding (5y+3)2{\displaystyle (5y+3)^{2}}, you would calculate (5y)(3)=15y{\displaystyle (5y)(3)=15y}.
 If the binomials show subtraction, you should multiply by -2. The result will be the middle term in the trinomial.

For example, (2)(15y)=30y{\displaystyle (2)(15y)=30y}. So, your trinomial now looks like this: 25y2+30y+b2{\displaystyle 25y^{2}+30y+b^{2}}.
 Again, make sure you are using the original b{\displaystyle b} term from the binomial expression. The square will give you the last term in the trinomial.For example, 32=9{\displaystyle 3^{2}=9}. So, (5y+3)2=25y2+30y+9{\displaystyle (5y+3)^{2}=25y^{2}+30y+9}

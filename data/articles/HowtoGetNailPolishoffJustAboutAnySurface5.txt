 For granite, grout, concrete, brick, sandstone, tile, or a similar surface, you will need a gentle scrub brush and a few cleaning agents to remove spilled nail polish., Take a plastic putty knife, or some other hard edge to scrape away any polish you can. Scrape slow and gentle so you don't further damage your floor.
 Take a clean cloth and dip it in acetone. Then, dab the polish stain with firm pressure until you lift the stain.
 Make a cleaning solution of baking soda and water, and use either a soft-bristled scrub, or a soft sponge, to clean the remainder of the stain. When you are satisfied, clean the area again with warm water.

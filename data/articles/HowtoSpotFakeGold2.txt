 Gold is not magnetic, however, many metals used to make fake gold are. Get a magnet that is stronger than a typical refrigerator magnet to perform this test.Hold the magnet slightly above the gold piece.
Observe if the gold is attracted to the magnet and if the magnet can pick up the piece of gold.
 You can test whether or not the piece of gold floats to determine if its real. Real gold is dense and will sink, but many pieces of fake gold will float.Get a glass large enough to fit the piece of gold, and fill it with water.
Drop the gold piece into the water, and observe it.
 This is a good test to use on scrap gold, but not recommended for jewelry you plan to wear or resell. This test uses nitric acid to see if the gold has a chemical reaction with it. One hundred percent gold will have no reaction to the nitric acid.Put on safety goggles and gloves before working the the nitric acid.
Make a light, small scratch on the gold using a nail file.
Use an eyedropper to apply one drop of nitric acid to the scratch on the gold.
If the liquid turns greenish, the item is probably mostly another metal like zinc and plated with gold. If the liquid turns a milky color, the item most likely is mostly sterling silver and plated with gold.

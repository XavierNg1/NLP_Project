 One of the best ways to avoid clutter is to not buy anything extraneous, but this can be hard for someone with ADHD, as you may have compulsive tendencies. Before you go shopping, make a list and try to bring enough cash to cover those purchases only (with a little wiggle room). If there are stores where you know you tend to spend a lot of money or leave with extra items, avoid those stores., You should turn down any free items that people try to give you. Tell them that you simply do not need the item and will not use it. This will allow you to reduce clutter before it happens.If someone tries to give you a free t-shirt, tell them you already have a full closet.
If someone tries to give you a free sample of a new product, tell them you already have plenty of it.
 Tell your bank to send you paperless statements. Instead of receiving your bank or credit card statement in the mail, you will log in to your account online and view a pdf attachment or online bill. You will avoid the chore of going through stacks of bills to see what you need to keep and what can be shredded. Instead, keep the pdf files you need on your hard drive or just go to your online account when you need the information., Tell cashiers and retailers that you wonâ€™t need a paper receipt. If you do accept receipts, you should shred and get rid of them whenever possible.If you need a receipt for a possible return, you could keep a stack of such receipts in a file. However, avoid keeping every single receipt. Keep only the receipts for purchases you may need to return or exchange.
In addition to saving paper, you will avoid contact with the chemical BPA contained in receipts. Exposure to BPA is bad for your health and especially if you are pregnant.

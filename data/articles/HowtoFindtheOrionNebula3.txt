 The right ascension of a celestial object is the astronomical equivalent of longitude, and measures the distance eastward from the celestial equator towards the vernal equinox (the point at which the celestial equator and ecliptic intersect during spring in the northern hemisphere.)The Orion Nebula’s right ascension is 5 hours.In other words, the nebula will cross the celestial meridian (the point directly above you or an observer) five hours after the vernal equinox.
 Declination is an astronomical equivalent to latitude, and provides guidance toward a point on the celestial sphere (the visible “sphere” of stars and astronomical objects surrounding the earth). Declination is measured relative to the celestial equator (the line you’d get if the equator were projected out into space). The Orion Nebula’s declination is five degrees.In other words, it lies along a plane five degrees above the celestial equator.
 First, you’ll need to adjust the placement of your telescope so that it is “in station,” parallel to the axis of the earth. A telescope in station would trace a direct line to the equator if the earth were flat.


Use your setting circle to find the nebula. You can designate the declination and right ascension mechanically or, on a newer scope, digitally.Look through the eyepiece to see M42.

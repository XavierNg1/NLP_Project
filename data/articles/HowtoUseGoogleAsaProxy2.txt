 Open any web browser. You can use Google Mobilizer as a proxy from any web browser.
 Since the site is blocked, you cannot just use a search engine to get to it. You have to know the direct link or URL to the website you want to access. As an example, use the WikiHow URL: https://www.wikihow.com/.
 Using Google Mobilizer as a proxy means going through Google mobilizer service to access the website:


Start with the link. Use this direct link to begin with using the WikiHow URL: http://www.google.ie/gwt/x?u=https://www.wikihow.com/.
Input the site URL. Use the link as is and just edit the URL at the end for the website you want to access. Put this after the “u” text in the link. In the example above, this would be https://www.wikihow.com.
 Enter the full link in the address bar of your web browser and hit Enter. You will be in the Google Mobilizer site, but the website you want to visit will be displayed right on it. You can now access it normally.


This works best for text-heavy pages as some formatting gets lost.

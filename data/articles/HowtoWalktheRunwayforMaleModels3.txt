, A long hallway is the perfect place to practice your walk at home. Run a strip of masking tape down the center of the hallway to help you stay in a straight line. If you have one, hang a tall mirror at the end of the hallway, then play some music and practice walking, posing, and turning., If you're just starting out, you should practice your walk, pose, and turn for at least an hour every day. Once you start booking gigs, you should still practice several times a week, especially if your designer wants you to master a new turn or pose.Even the most experienced professional models have to practice regularly.
 Looking natural is a major part of walking the runway, and you can have a friend watch your walk and let you know of any awkward spots. While they can give you basic feedback, you should try to find someone with professional experience who can offer constructive criticism.If you’re friends with any professional models, ask them to watch you walk. If you don’t already have one, look into getting an agent, and consider taking walking classes.

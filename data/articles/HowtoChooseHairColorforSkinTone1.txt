 Broadly speaking, the shade of your skin is most likely pale, medium, olive, or dark/deep. This should be fairly obvious, but helpful in choosing a hair color. You won't want your hair color to exactly match your skin's shade and tone or your hair color will look washed out., Regardless of your skin's shade, you need to determine what your skin's undertone is: warm, cool, or neutral. Wear a white shirt and stand in front of the mirror. Stand in natural light or bright incandescent lights if possible. Look at the veins on the underside of your wrist to determine the undertone.


If the veins are predominantly blue-purple, you've got cool undertones. If they're mainly green, you've got warm undertones, and if they're a mix between the two, you have neutral undertones.
 If you're having trouble determining your skin's undertones, ask yourself a few simple questions. Do you look better in gold or silver? If gold, you've got warm undertones. If silver, you have cool undertones. What color are your eyes? If they're green, brown, or hazel, you've got warm undertones. If blue, grey, or green eyes, you've probably got cool undertones.One of the easiest ways to determine skin undertone is to consider how easily you burn. If you burn, rather than tan, you're cool, whereas if you tan easily, you're warm.

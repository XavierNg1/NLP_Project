 You’ll need to check each one separately to test for leaks. Because it requires separating the pieces, this method obviously won’t work for saxophones or flutes. Take the upper joint first, and close all of the keys., You need to make the joint airtight, so seal the far end with your free hand. Remove the air that’s already in the joint by sucking it out through the near end. Try to get as much air out as possible, so you create a suction effect inside the joint., When you let go of the bottom of the joint, you’ll hear a crisp popping sound if the pads are leak-free. If you don’t hear a pop or you need to apply extra pressure to achieve the sound, then there is a leak in the joint.You should repeat the process on the lower joint to check it for leaks.
Because this process doesn’t identify the specific pad that’s leaking, you’ll want to follow up by using a leak light or feeler paper to find it.

 Being beautiful will ensure that the users notice it for the first time. Being recognizable will help you when your user will come back or search for your app. Know that when users see an app icon, they instantly create an opinion about the quality of the app. First impression matters! So make it as powerful and attractive as possible.;
, E.g., blue box with an enclosed 'f'- Facebook, a small flying bird against blue background- twitter, Cursive 'P' against red- Pinterest, and a comical robot - Android. All these icons capitalize on the power of symbol and shapes. These are simple yet beautiful and recognizable. Don't go for complicated designs unless you can pull it off well.
 Colors say a lot about your app in particular and business in general. Use colors carefully. Don't make it clownish. Try not to use more than three colors. Know a little about color psychology. Green is usually associated with nature. Red is romantic, Blue signifies peace and orange oozes energy. Purple is royal. Similarly, know how colors choice is determined by gender, age, and region.
 Remember simplicity is a virtue in visual arts and design.  Don't use long string of texts. Similarly, don't use photos unless you are a rock star or Hollywood celebrity.
 For example, use heart symbol for dating and matchmaking app. Computer or cellphone for cellphones and gadgets. Eateries can have food symbols. Religious symbols are universally recognized, so bank on this phenomenon.
 Google has laid out icons design guideline for developers. This has led to more unified icons. Apple on the other hand already had the "squircle" design for their native apps, and has always been very rich aesthetically, which led to synchronized designs by others, too.

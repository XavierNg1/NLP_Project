 Anxiety is a serious disorder that very often causes physical body symptoms. In the face of performance or social interaction, your child may demonstrate physical manifestations of their fear. They may become physically immobilized (literally paralyzed with fear), have trouble catching their breath, and have a racing heartbeat., It is not uncommon for a child to become so anxious that they have diarrhea, nausea, or even vomit.

If your child has frequent upset stomachs, start a log of when these bouts occur; if it’s often in response to doing or thinking about a social or performance activity, that’s a tip-off to social anxiety disorder., Dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion, feeling outside of the body, and muscle tension are other common physical symptoms of anxiety.These may be difficult for a child to recognize. Ask your child questions to elicit information about their subjective experience with anxiety. Try questions like:


”Do you feel like the room is spinning or like you might fall down?”
”Do you feel achy or sore all over?”
”Where are we right now? What day of the week is it?” Inability to answer simple questions can indicate confusion or panic.
 If he or she often blushes, sweats, or shakes in social environments it may indicate social anxiety.

 Cut your pansy stems back to about two inches in height. Try to make the cut about a quarter of an inch above the leaf set closest to this two-inch length.


You can compost the cut foliage unless it appears mildewed or otherwise diseased. Dig out and discard any plants that show signs of disease. This will be covered more fully in the next step.
 Try to remove all yellowing, diseased or withered foliage to improve the plant’s appearance and hopefully stop the spread of disease. Any plants where disease can’t be contained should be dug up and thrown away to prevent them from infecting others.


As mentioned previously, avoid composting diseased plant matter as the compost can infect other plants.
 Some gardeners in milder climates will see their pansies survive the winter to re-bloom in the springtime without the help of mulch. If you live in a very cold climate, diligently protecting and mulching your plants can help them survive the coldest months. Some gardeners protect plants with straw or a cover of evergreen tree branches to help them survive the winter.


If successful, the pansies should bloom again in the early spring.
 New growth should hopefully begin to appear on your pansy plant and it should bloom again until the first frost arrives.

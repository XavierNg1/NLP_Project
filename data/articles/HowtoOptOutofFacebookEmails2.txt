 Look for the Facebook app on your mobile device. It’s the one with the app icon with the Facebook logo. Tap the icon to launch the app.
 Tap the three-bar icon on the rightmost part of the header. This will bring down a menu. Tap on “Account Settings” from here, and you will be brought to the Settings screen for your Facebook account.
 On the Accounts Settings menu, tap “Notifications.” You will be brought to your Notification Settings screen.


Settings related to all types of Facebook notifications can be configured here.
 From the notifications options, tap “Email.” You will be brought to the Email Notifications Settings screen, where you can see three options for email notifications.
 Tap the option for “Only notifications about your account, security and privacy” from the list. You’ve now opted out of all non-essential emails from Facebook.

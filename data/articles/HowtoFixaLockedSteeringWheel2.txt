 If the ignition cylinder has seized, spraying a small amount of electrical cleaner into the key hole may lubricate it enough to turn. Be careful not to spray too much into the key hole. A few short squirts should suffice. Once done, insert the key and turn it back and forth gently to work the lubricant in.If this works, you may need to replace the ignition cylinder soon as it gets progressively worse.
Liquid graphite may also work to lubricate the cylinder.
 Debris caught in the ignition can prevent the key from turning, which will prevent the steering wheel from unlocking. Purchase canned air from a local retail or office supply store and insert the straw from the nozzle directly into the key hole. It should only take a few short sprays to clean out any debris.Put on eye protection before spraying canned air into the key hole to prevent debris from getting into your eyes.
 If there was any debris stuck to the key when you inserted it, it may have gotten caught in the pins of the ignition cylinder. Insert the key completely, then slide it back out. Repeat the process a few times to try to move any debris that may be caught in the cylinder.If this works, the issue will likely continue to occur until the debris is cleaned out from the ignition cylinder.
Use canned air to clean out the lock cylinder if this method worked.
 If your key wonâ€™t turn when you insert it into the ignition it may be because the key has been damaged. Rounded or chipped teeth on the key will no longer engage the pins in the ignition cylinder to the depth necessary to spin it. Any of these could result in the key failing to turn in the ignition, which will also prevent the wheel from being unlocked.You will need a replacement key if the key is too damaged to turn the ignition cylinder.
Do not copy a damaged key. A replacement will have to be cut by a dealership that works with vehicles of your make and model.

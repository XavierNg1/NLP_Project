, Follow this link to get started: https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/combochart., You may choose from options such as: Timelines, Pie Charts, Bar Charts, Scatter Charts, Word Trees and many more.

Once you have chosen your chart, click the blue bar that says "Code it yourself on JSFiddle".
 It will take you to the JSFiddle website where you will see the Chart you have chosen, along with the code. You will see the information from the preset sample chart you chose in the Google Charts website.

It is possible to get a link for your visual if you are not registered into the JSFiddle website; however, if you want to be able to save your progress on a project and return to it later, you must register.
 In order to get your information on the graph or visual you do not have to be a professional programmer at all. All you must do is replace the already coded information with your desired information with the same format it was presented with the sample.

If you would like to add any information or take away any information you must do so by not disrupting the format or organization of the coding.
If you have disrupted the coding or organization you will know when you press the "Run" button.
If you get no output when the "Run" option is clicked then the adjustment you made to the coding is invalid.
 To do this, click the "Share" option and copy the link in the "Share full screen result" slot and your chart will be a paste away from anyone or any website of your choice.

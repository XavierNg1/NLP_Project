 This bohemian gardening solution is a hit among contemporary interior designers. The macrame weaves are shaped into nets to nestle lightweight planters in, then suspended from the ceiling at various heights. Hanging planters are a wonderful method of presentation for home gardening projects, and can also free up valuable space around your porch or patio.Hanging macrame containers aren’t just for plants—they can also be useful for tea lights, bird feeders, or even craft art and decorations.
Make sure the cord and knotting style you implement are strong enough to hold objects with a little weight.
 Give plain display pieces some much-needed flair by enveloping them in a weblike exterior. The macrame can cover the entire outside of the piece, or encircle the center in a sleek band. You’ll quickly turn old, outdated items into conversation starters.Wrap and hang unused glass bottles or mason jars to convert them into minimalistic miniature flower vases.The same thing can be done for bins, jars, kitchen storage canisters and any number of similarly shaped containers.
 Fabric construction can make almost anything more charming, including simple storage containers. Wind sturdy cord around a premade basket frame to give it a tight structure, or make the whole thing from scratch. When you’re done, you’ll have a quaint carrier perfect for holding fresh fruit, bath accessories or the daily mail.Use a firm type of cord that will be able to hold up to frequent handling while retaining its shape.Include handles to make your baskets easier to tote from place to place.

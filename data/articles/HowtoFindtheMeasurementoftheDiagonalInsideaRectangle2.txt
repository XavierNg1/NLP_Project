 The formula is A=lw{\displaystyle A=lw}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the rectangle, l{\displaystyle l} equals the length of the rectangle, and w{\displaystyle w} equals the width of the rectangle., Make sure you substitute for the variable A{\displaystyle A}.

For example, if the area of the rectangle is 35 square centimeters, your formula will look like this: 35=lw{\displaystyle 35=lw}.
 To do this, divide both sides of the equation by l{\displaystyle l}. Set this value aside. You will plug it into the perimeter formula later.

For example:35=lw{\displaystyle 35=lw}35l=w{\displaystyle {\frac {35}{l}}=w}.
 The formula is P=2(w+l){\displaystyle P=2(w+l)}, where w{\displaystyle w} equals the width of the rectangle, and l{\displaystyle l} equals the length of the rectangle., Make sure you substitute for the variable P{\displaystyle P}.

For example, if the perimeter of a rectangle is 24 centimeters, your formula will look like this: 24=2(w+l){\displaystyle 24=2(w+l)}.
 This will give you the value of w+l{\displaystyle w+l}.

For example:24=2(w+l){\displaystyle 24=2(w+l)}242=2(w+l)2{\displaystyle {\frac {24}{2}}={\frac {2(w+l)}{2}}}12=w+l{\displaystyle 12=w+l}.
 Use the value you found by rearranging the formula for area.

For example, if using the area formula you found that 35l=w{\displaystyle {\frac {35}{l}}=w}, replace this value of w{\displaystyle w} into the perimeter formula:12=w+l{\displaystyle 12=w+l}12=35l+l{\displaystyle 12={\frac {35}{l}}+l}


, To do this, multiply both sides of the equation by l{\displaystyle l}.

For example:12=35l+l{\displaystyle 12={\frac {35}{l}}+l}12×l=(35l×l)+(l×l){\displaystyle 12\times l=({\frac {35}{l}}\times l)+(l\times l)}12l=35+l2{\displaystyle 12l=35+l^{2}}


, To do this, subtract the first-degree term from both sides of the equation.

For example:12l=35+l2{\displaystyle 12l=35+l^{2}}12l−12l=35+l2−12l{\displaystyle 12l-12l=35+l^{2}-12l}0=35+l2−12l{\displaystyle 0=35+l^{2}-12l}


, This means the term with the exponent will be first, followed by the term with the variable, followed by the constant. When reordering, make sure you keep the appropriate positive and negative signs. You should note that the equation is now set up as a quadratic equation.

For example, 0=35+l2−12l{\displaystyle 0=35+l^{2}-12l} becomes 0=l2−12l+35{\displaystyle 0=l^{2}-12l+35}.

For example, the equation 0=l2−12l+35{\displaystyle 0=l^{2}-12l+35} can be factored as 0=(l−7)(l−5){\displaystyle 0=(l-7)(l-5)}.
 To do this, set each term to zero and solve for the variable. You will find two solutions, or roots, to the equation. Since you are working with a rectangle, the two roots will be the width and length of your rectangle.

For example:0=(l−7){\displaystyle 0=(l-7)}7=l{\displaystyle 7=l}AND0=(l−5){\displaystyle 0=(l-5)}5=l{\displaystyle 5=l}.So, the length and width of the rectangle are 7 cm and 5 cm.
 The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the side lengths of a right triangle, and c{\displaystyle c} equals the length of a right triangle’s hypotenuse.You use the Pythagorean Theorem because a diagonal of a rectangle cuts the rectangle into two congruent right triangles.The width and length of the rectangle are the side lengths of the triangle; the diagonal is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
 It doesn’t matter which value you use for which variable.

For example, if you found the width and length of the rectangle are 5 cm and 7 cm, your formula will look like this: 52+72=c2{\displaystyle 5^{2}+7^{2}=c^{2}}.
 Remember, squaring a number means to multiply the number by itself.

For example:52+72=c2{\displaystyle 5^{2}+7^{2}=c^{2}}25+49=c2{\displaystyle 25+49=c^{2}}74=c2{\displaystyle 74=c^{2}}


, The easiest way to find a square root is to use a calculator. You can use an online calculator if you do not have a scientific calculator.This will give you the value of c{\displaystyle c}, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and the diagonal of the rectangle.

For example:74=c2{\displaystyle 74=c^{2}}74=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {74}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}8.6024=c{\displaystyle 8.6024=c}So, the diagonal of a rectangle with an area of 35 cm and a perimeter of 24 cm is about 8.6 cm.

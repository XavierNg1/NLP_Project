 Instead of having your child’s hand in a bowl of paint or plaster, apply the material with a brush. Spread paint or plaster evenly over the child's hand for full coverage.
 Gently press down on his or her hand to make sure you leave an actual handprint. Tell your child to hold his or her hand still (if he or she understands) and then gently lift the hand.
 If you're working with plaster, you may not be able to wait for the material to dry in order to decorate. Follow the kit’s directions for best results.
 If you waited for the handprint to dry, tap into your imagination and create art from your child’s handprint. Ideas for what to do are listed next:


Using a marker, draw in faces, wings, fins, arms and legs, etc., to create creatures from the handprints. Add scenery.
Draw a background pattern around the hands. Use interesting patterns, neon colors, bright lines, etc.
Make modern art. Turn the handprints into imitations of famous modern art pieces. Check online for images of such artworks.
Ask your child to decorate the handprints. He or she will be bound to come up with fun ideas.
Draw around the handprints several times, so that it looks like the lines are radiating out from the original handprints. Use the colors of the rainbow to do this.
If it's holiday time, use holiday themes to inspire the artwork touch-ups.

To do this, pick a cell where you want the minimum to display (for example, maybe one cell above where you'll put the range, below the maximum).

Type = in the call for the range (possibly below the other two).
Type in the cell number that you used for typing the maximum number first - for example, B1.
Then type a -.
Type in the minimum cell number. For example, B2. Your formula should read something like: =B1-B2

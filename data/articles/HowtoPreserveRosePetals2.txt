 You can also use an oven to dry out petals. This method is quicker than air drying, but may cause more discoloration. To start, heat your oven to 180 degrees Fahrenheit.Arrange the petals in a layer on a cookie sheet. Make sure the petals are not touching.Place the cookie sheet in the oven. Heat the roses for at least 3 hours, keeping the oven door open the entire time.Remove the tray and set it aside in a safe place where it's unlikely to be disturbed. Leave overnight. There should be no more moisture on the flowers by morning., An iron can also help dry out flowers for preservation. However, this flattens the petals significantly. If you don't want to distort the shape, you may want to try another method.


To start, heat your iron to its lowest setting. Do not add water to the iron. If there is any water in the iron, empty it.Place the flowers between two sheets of absorbent paper. Use a book to flatten them slightly. Then, press the iron on top of the absorbent sheets for 10 to 15 seconds. Do not make any gliding motions. Simply press the iron down., A microwave can also help dry out flower petals for preservation. This process is very quick, which is its main advantage. However, pressing flowers under a microwave can cause them to brown.


You should buy a professional microwave flower press, which you can buy online or at a local craft store, for the best results. However, if you don't have a professional flower press you can make one by placing the petals between two ceramic tiles. From there, you can tie the tiles together with non-flammable string or twine.Place the press in the microwave. Heat it for 30 to 60 seconds at a time. Allow the press to cool off completely between sessions.Check the flowers periodically. Once they appear completely dry, you can remove them and use them for craft purposes.

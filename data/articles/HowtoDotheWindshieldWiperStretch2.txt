 You can do a transitional windshield wiper exercise from the floor that will help prepare you for hanging windshield wipers. Use this exercise to perfect your form before you add the challenge of gravity.Laying on your back, extend your legs straight upward so that your legs are perpendicular to the floor at a 90-degree angle from your torso.
Slowly lower your legs to one side, back up to start, then to the other side. Keep your legs straight. Focus on keeping your shoulder blades pinned to the floor and your hips stable.
 Advancing to hanging windshield wipers requires significant core and upper body strength. Before you attempt the hanging windshield wiper exercise, be confident dead-hanging from a pull-up bar for several minutes.You also may want to practice lifting your hips so that your body is parallel to the floor. This will help strengthen the abdominal muscles you'll use during the hanging windshield wiper exercise.
 Hanging windshield wipers are done with your torso parallel to the floor. When you first start, you may not be able to lift your torso this high. Just raise your hips as high as you can and still consistently maintain good form.As you raise your hips, raise your feet also. Ideally, your torso will be parallel to the floor and your legs will be at a 90-degree angle from your torso, perpendicular to the floor.
Your arms and shoulders are most important in terms of working the correct muscles and not causing undue strain.
 With slow, controlled movements, move your legs first to one side, back to your starting position, and then down to the other side. Try to maintain the same form as you did when you were doing the same exercise on the floor.Bend your elbows as much as necessary to lessen the pressure on your shoulders. Focus on keeping your shoulders neutral, not crunched in toward your head.

 It looks like this: you + Difficult Person + every other member of your family., When you are a teen, it may be impossible to cut the toxic person from your life. When the time comes that you can cut the ties, you may not be able to without cutting out valued family members. For example, if your mother is the toxicity in your life, yet you have a very close relationship with your dad, you have a real dilemma.After you graduate, you could continue to bite your tongue, suppress the tension you feel in your back, and remind yourself that you plan to move away. You will only have to see your mother once or twice a year, and deal with the monthly (or weekly, ugh!) phone calls. It would make things a lot easier to maintain your relationship with your dad.
You could cut the ties to the toxicity the day you graduate. You can move and live the happy carefree life you have dreamed of. Remember, however, that you will likely be cutting off the ties to your dad as well.
There are also your grandparents to think about. If you cut ties with their daughter, will it affect your relationship with them? Will they feel obligated to take sides with their daughter?

, There is no right or wrong answer. Cutting toxicity from your life is very important to your happiness and emotional well being, but recognize that it does come with consequences. Only you can decide what is right for you.

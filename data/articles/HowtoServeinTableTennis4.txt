 Backspin serves are best when your opponent is standing back from the table. They can add variety to a match that has contained lots of long, topspin serves., If your opponent doesn’t know which way you’re going to spin the ball, they’ll need to stand in the middle of their side. This will make it tough for them to return any sidespin serves., The longer the ball is in the air, the faster it’ll be coming down. This fast speed will allow you to put more spin onto the ball after you strike it. If you have more spin, your opponent may have a tougher time returning the ball., This serve puts a little sidespin on the ball. This will make the ball difficult to return with a backhand, as it’ll break away from your opponent and may not make it back over the net. Your racket should be in the closed position for this serve., This serve also puts sidespin onto the ball, this time from the opposite direction. Most players are more used to the standard forehand pendulum, so this serve may catch them off guard., Using an open racket, hit the ball from right to left. This serve will also add sidespin and make it difficult for your opponent to control their return., The best way to have a great serve game is to be prepared with lots of options. You’ll probably develop a specialty that becomes your favorite go-to serve. Be sure you also practice long and short serves, all the different spins, and different table placements. Run drills with a partner to get the feel for serving as you would in a match. You can use each other to practice all the different racket positions, striking motions, and spins.
You can also practice serving against the wall if you’re alone.

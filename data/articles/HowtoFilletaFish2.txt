 Position the knife behind the gills and cut downward at a slightly diagonal angle (in the direction of the head) through the bone. Flip the fish over and make another diagonal cut. Remove and discard of the head.
 Place the knife down where the tail meets the body, and cut straight down through the skin and bone of the fish. Remove and discard of the tail.
 Lift it slightly away from the fish's body and insert the knife, cutting downward until the knife hits the backbone. Turn the knife so that it is aligned with the ribcage, and push it down so that the tip extends about midway down the fish's body. Now run the knife along the ribcage, separating the meat of the fish from the ribs.
 This is the small hole located on the underside of the fish. Continue cutting along the bones until the fillet ends, at the tail.
 Pull it away from the ribcage, and use the knife to loosen it where it is still attached. Lift the fillet away from the body and set it on the plate.
 Using the same method, slice into the fish until the knife hits the backbone. Turn the knife so that it is aligned with the ribcage, push it down until the tip extends about midway down the fish's body, and run the knife along the ribcage to separate the meat from the ribs.
 Keep cutting along the bones until the fillet is cut off at the tail.
 Carefully lift it from the ribcage, using the knife to loosen it where it is till attached. Lift the fillet from the bones and place it on the plate.

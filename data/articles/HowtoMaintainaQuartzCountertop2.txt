 Wet a cloth with a citrus cleaner like Goo Gone. Try pouring a bit of cleaner onto the stain and allow it to sit for five to ten minutes before wiping it up, if the stain is particularly tough. Follow up by cleaning the counter well with warm water.








Try this for gooey stains like sticker adhesive or caramel.
 For example, ink, dye or permanent marker.
 Make sure the cleaner is compatible with your brand of countertop. Spray glass cleaner on your countertops. Allow it to sit for several minutes. Then wipe it clean with a wet cloth.








Although some brands of quartz counters recommend using glass cleaners, others advise against it.
Highly pigmented quartz may fade over a period of time if ammonia-based cleaner is left over.

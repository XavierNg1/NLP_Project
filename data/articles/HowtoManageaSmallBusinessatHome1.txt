 To successfully run a business from home, you need to designate space for it.


Set aside some space in a bedroom, basement or other room if you do not have enough rooms in your house for a dedicated office. Use this space for your business activities only.
Designate your office or work space as "off limits" to other family members or roommates.;
, Design whatever filing and storage systems you need to efficiently run your business.


Keep all business-related papers and supplies in your office space. You do not want to be hunting for a receipt or an invoice in your kitchen.
 Make sure you have a reliable computer, printer, fax machine, mobile phone and any other business and office equipment you need.


Keep supplies on hand as well, such as pens, paper clips, legal pads and post-it notes.

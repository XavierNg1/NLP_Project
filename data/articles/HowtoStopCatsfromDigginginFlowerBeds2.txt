 The fragrance will make your flower bed smell fresh and citrus-like, and has the added advantage that it will also repel cats.
 This will help you to avoid a spillage of the lemons.
 This will form the rigid body of the scarecrow. Squeeze some citrus fruits into a bucket (orange, lime, lemon) and paint the juices onto the board to repel cats; the juices will enhance the repellent effect.
 Roughly three-quarters of the way up the body of the scarecrow, horizontally place another shorter plank. Repeat the previous step if you want to add more effect.
 Leave old clothes in the bucket overnight so that the fabric can absorb the leftover juices, and dress the scarecrow in the morning.
 It's a good idea to refresh the lemons and scent every few weeks.

 Wind Waker is the only 3-D Zelda version where you’ll be able to ride a raft. Rafts are found almost everywhere in the game. To get one, simply head to the edge of any island you’re in and you’ll see one floating near the shore.
 Simply jump on the raft to get on board. Note that though some rafts are unmanned, some are guarded by Bokoblins or pirate monsters. Kill these enemies first with your sword before boarding the rafts.
 Once you’re on the raft, press the “A” button on your game controller to set sail and start moving. Use the directional arrow keys or joystick to move towards the direction you’re going.
 Once you get to your destination, jump off or simply walk onto land to safely exit the raft.

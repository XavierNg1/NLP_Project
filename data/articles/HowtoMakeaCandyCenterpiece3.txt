 You'll need a square of plastic, about 5 inches (13Â cm) by 5 inches, to put candy in. You can even use the non-zip plastic sandwich bags, though you won't put the candy inside the bag. Rather, lay the bag out flat. You'll need small candies, such as jelly beans, gummies, and small chocolate candies in solid colors., Spoon a small amount of candy onto the plastic square. Gather up the corners of the bag until the candy is in the center. Make a little bag out of the plastic by turning the candy in your hand with the corners sticking up, much like putting a wrapper on a lollipop. Use a twisty tie to secure the plastic where you twisted it, just above the candy., Begin wrapping a second piece of plastic around the bag you've already made, much as you did the first piece of plastic. Put a stick in between the layers. The sharp end should be sticking out, as it will go in foam later. Tie the second layer up with a twisty tie.Continue making flowers in other colors of candy, so you have a whole bouquet. You can use shades of the same color, such as shades of pink, or make a rainbow bouquet.
 Find a vase. Pick a foam ball that just fits into the vase. It's best if the foam stays near the top of the vase. Slide the foam ball in, pushing it down gently to make sure it stays in place. If it's slightly too big, you can use a bit of hot glue to hold it in place., Stick the candy flowers down into the foam, adding them all around the ball. It can help to make a hole with a stick without flowers first, so you don't squash your candy. Keep adding flowers until the ball is full, then poke in some fresh or fake leaves in places to add texture and color.

 If you already made one and stored it in the fridge, remove it so it can warm up to room temperature. If not, make a cold brew as described, but stop short of straining the liquid. Let the rice sit in the water instead and cover the bowl., Allow the rice water to ferment anywhere from 12 to 48 hours. Uncover and smell the contents periodically. Once it begins to smell sour, consider it fermented. Expect the time needed for this to vary depending on the exact temperature, plus whether or not the liquid has been strained.An unstrained mixture should ferment in 12 to 24 hours.
Strained liquid will take between 24 and 48 hours.
Higher room temperatures will reduce the amount of time needed.
 First, strain the liquid if you havenâ€™t already done so. Transfer the liquid to a pot or saucepan. Raise the heat to medium-high. Bring the water to a boil to cease the fermentation.Boiling the water after fermentation is often recommended, but not strictly required.
 If you intend to use it right away, allow the water to cool first to avoid scalding. Otherwise, transfer it to a sealable container. Store in the refrigerator.Expect fermented water to pack a punch. Dilute the fermented rice water with plain warm water as desired when you use it.

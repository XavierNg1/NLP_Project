 The season ball is probably one of the hardest balls in sports. In slip fielding, the ball comes towards you at very high speeds; it may even exceed 100 mph (160 km/h). It's quite easy to eliminate your fear of the season ball. As you gradually continue to play cricket, your fear of the ball will go down less and less. This really is not a big issue to worry about.;
, Slip fielders will always be crouching down and they have very strong knees. Slip fielders need to spring whenever the ball is up in the air. They rely on their knees a lot.
 Improving hand-to-eye coordination and reflexes is the most important of aspect of being a slip fielder. With the ball coming at you at great speeds, you literally have a split second before the ball comes to you. Training for this can be done with much practice

, Even when you do reach the goal of becoming of a skilled slip fielder, you must continue practicing to make sure your skills are always sharp.

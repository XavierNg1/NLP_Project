 Immediately on arrest, police are required to read your Miranda rights, and inform you about your right to remain silent until consultation with a lawyer. If you are not told your rights, or can't understand them, tell police.;
, They will need to know everything in order to defend you effectively.
 Dress up in a business like manner, you're not going to a party. Eat a good breakfast (not too much or little), and gather up all your papers. Don't forget anything, because that might postpone your case and anger the judge. If you are religious, you can pray or something, if that makes you feel better, or you can just hope for the best and then leave. Try to calm down.
 Rushing will only stress you out more. Again, you should wake up early enough not to have to rush. The ideal scenario would be getting there with a few minutes to get yourself together.
 You might want to bring a book, or you could read your case papers (might help you prepare for your case).
 Speak loudly and clearly, and only if you are spoken to.
 The prosecutor will fling questions at you and will probably attempt to twist what you say. They aren't doing this to be mean, they're just exploring what you say from either side. Your lawyer is allowed to object to any questions (hence the term "objection!" ) but the judge might overrule this.
 You could also eat a snack if you've got one, and it's highly suggested that you bring one. Use this time to consult with your lawyer and catch your breath.

 There are many products, such as Nature’s Miracle and Simple Solution, that were created to target pet odor. Purchase an enzyme neutralizer at a pet store and make sure to follow the directions on the label exactly. Completely cover all affected areas of your carpet to get the best possible result., Get a liter-sized bottle of club soda and carefully pour it onto the carpet and let it fizz. Once the fizzing has subsided, use bath towels or paper towels to blot up all the liquid and open the windows so that the carpet can air dry. Try repeating this regimen a couple of times if the odor is still lingering., Especially if you’ve already tried other options, you may need to clean your carpets with a machine to get rid of pet urine smells. You can rent a carpet cleaning machine from a home improvement store.


Don’t use a steam cleaning machine because hot temperatures may permanently set the odor.

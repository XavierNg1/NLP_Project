 Capture raw footage from a video camera using your computer's capture card. Edit your footage using video editing software and choose a file format that is compatible with your DVD authoring software.;

The more expensive the DVD authoring software, the more video input options you will have, but you may be paying for features you won't use. Before you buy DVD authoring software, make sure it will accept your video input, then decide what features you need.
 A consumer single-layer DVD will hold 63 minutes of video encoded at a fixed 8 megabits per second.


You can lower the encoding rate below 8 megabits per second in order to put more minutes on the DVD, but you will see noise or other compression defects on the DVD.
Your DVD authoring software may have a "variable bit rate" option. This option will vary the bitrate of the encoding depending on the action in the video. This will allow for more minutes to be burned onto a DVD, while still maintaining some quality.
 You can choose 1 region, multiple regions or all regions.


Region 1: Canada and the U.S.
Region 2: Europe (including Iceland and Greenland), Japan, the Middle East (including Egypt), and South Africa.
Region 3: Southeast Asia.
Region 4: Australia, New Zealand, Central America and South America.
Region 5: Russia, the rest of Africa, and the remaining parts of Asia.
Region 6: China
Region 0: playable in all regions.
 If you want to protect your DVD and not allow any copies, then 0 would be your choice. Some DVD authoring software will not give you this option.
 The authoring software will convert your file into MPEG-2 DVD compatible format using the settings you have chosen and copy your video onto a DVD.

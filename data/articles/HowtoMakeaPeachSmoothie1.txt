 You don't have to be neat or precise when cutting the peaches. You simply want to cut them up so that they are easier to blend. Discard the pits and skins.


For a thicker smoothie, use frozen peaches.;
, The more juice you add, the thinner your smoothie will become. You can use store-bought orange juice or freshly-squeezed orange juice.
 You can use plain, vanilla, or even peach-flavored yogurt. This will help make your smoothie thick and creamy.
 The ice is not completely necessary, especially if you are using frozen peaches, but it will help thicken your smoothie even more. It will also make it extra coldâ€”perfect for a hot, summer day!

, From time to time, you may have to pause the blender, and push the smoothie down the sides to help everything blend together. When you are done, there should be no lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls.
 If you'd like, you can garnish each glass with a fresh mint leaf or a slice of peach.

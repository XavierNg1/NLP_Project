 If you’re in a hurry and need your clothes to smell nice fast, put them in the dryer for a fifteen minutes with a couple of scented dryer sheets. This won’t get your clothes clean, but it will refresh your clothes, make them smell better and get the wrinkles out.
 Mix equal parts of white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Turn your clothes inside out and spray the garment with it. Hang the clothes up and let them air-dry for a few minutes. The vinegar smell will go away after a few minutes and won’t be detectable when it dries.


Test the vinegar solution on a small area of the garment before spraying the whole thing with it. As long as the color doesn’t run and there’s no visible change to the item, it is safe for you to use.
 It is best to spray the perfume directly onto your body and then get dressed. You can spray perfume directly on your clothes if the item is made out of natural fibers, like cotton and linen. Avoid spraying synthetic fibers, such as polyester, with perfume. Be aware that some perfumes can stain light-colored items and damage silk.
 Clothes can absorb odors, so if your house doesn’t smell so great, neither will your clothes. Clean, dust and vacuum your home regularly, especially the rooms that contain clothing. Use air fresheners and avoid smoking inside the house.
 When you get home from school or work, take off your clothes and hang them by an open window. This can help reduce odors and refresh your clothes. This is especially helpful if you wear a uniform and don’t want to wash it every day.
 Never leave your dirty clothes near or on top of your clean clothes, because the smell can transfer. Place dirty items in a hamper, preferably in another room. Avoid putting wet or damp items into the hamper. Let the damp item dry before putting it into the laundry basket. Putting damp items into your laundry basket will cause odor-causing bacteria and mildew to grow.

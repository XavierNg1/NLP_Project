 If you decide you want to make bunny ears that are bit stronger than paper ones, you can make some from fabric or felt. For this method you will need a good sturdy headband or hairband to attach the ears to. Something like an Alice band would be a good choice.
 Place your hair band onto the felt and draw the shape of your ears directly onto the felt. You can choose whatever shape or colour you like.
 Now take a piece of 20 gauge wire and attach one end of it to your headband, and bend it into the shape of the ear you have just drawn. You should leave enough clearance, about an inch, outside the wire for you to apply glue. When the wire is bent into shape, trim it and wrap the other end around your headband.Repeat this process for the other ear.
You should have two basic wire bunny ears attached to the headband.
 Carefully cut along the outside edge of your drawn ears on the felt or fabric. You need a front and a back for each ear, so after you cut each one out, use it as a template to cut out its reverse side.You should be left with four pieces of fabric, two pairs.
You can cut out smaller pieces of fabric of a different colour to stick on as the inner ear.
Or you can decorate them however you like.
 Now lay down one of each ear piece and put the wire ear frames on top of it. It should fit easily, but you may have to bend the wire a little here and there. Then glue this bottom ear to the other piece of fabric you have cut out for each ear so that the wire is hidden inside.Itâ€™s a good idea to apply glue to the part on the inside of the wire first and stick it down.
Then glue around the edges to secure it.
Leave the glue to dry, and then you should have bunny ears that you can bend to shape.

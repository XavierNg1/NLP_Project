 The waistband side should be closest to you. Run your hand over the panty to ensure it's as flat as possible before beginning the fold.
 You will be folding toward the crotch of the panty. Do this using the narrowest possible folds.
 The panty should end up lying flat with the back side up and the crotch closest to you.
 The ends of each side of the waistband should end up overlapping each other.
 For larger types of panties with more fabric, it is best to fold twice on the way up.
 You should notice a distinct pocket inside the center of the bundle.
 This sounds complicated but it becomes a simple flick of the wrist once you get the hang of it. Start by placing your thumbs inside the pocket and bracing against each side of the opening.









Use your middle fingers to push the fabric along the back of the pocket up through the front opening while you fold the outside edges back with your thumbs.
Keep going until the bundle has been rolled into itself three times. You are essentially reversing the narrow waistband folds you made earlier in the process.
 The main advantage is that your underwear will not come unfolded until you are ready to put them on. The downside is that this method is a little more complex than the other folding techniques without being that much more compact.


This makes it ideal for people who tend to be indecisive about choosing underwear and like things to stay neat.

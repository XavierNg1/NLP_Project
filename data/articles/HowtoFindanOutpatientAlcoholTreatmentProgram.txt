A Relapse Outpatient Program (ROP) or Supportive Outpatient Program (SOP) may be available for less than a 6-week commitment. It also may require just 6 hours of commitment each week. This program helps patients cope with relapse triggers confront behavior patterns that may be affecting their full recovery.



Treatment methods vary. Programs often follow the 12-Step Model of recovery and use motivational enhancement and cognitive-behavior therapy. Yoga and other relaxation techniques may also be used. Family participation may be required, especially for adolescent programs.

 Foot blisters should be covered to reduce irritation and cut back on the risk of infection. Cover your blister with a soft dressing, like gauze or a loose bandage. If the blister is very sore, cut your dressing into a donut shape and place it around the blister to avoid putting pressure directly on it.Your dressing should be changed each day. Always wash your hands before touching the dressing and the area around the blister.;
, Antibiotic ointment helps prevent infections in a blister. You can buy antibiotic ointment at a pharmacy. Apply it to the blister as directed, especially before you put on your shoes or socks.Just vaseline may also be used.


Remember to wash your hands thoroughly before touching the blister.
 Friction can make a blister worse and increase pain. In order to reduce friction on a foot blister, pick up a powder designed for your feet at a local pharmacy. Pour it into your socks before putting on your shoes to reduce pain.Not all powders work for everyone. If a powder causes your blister to become irritated, stop using it.
 Take extra precautions to keep your feet comfortable while a blister is healing. Wear an extra pair of socks and loose-fitting shoes as the blister persists. This will cut back on pain and help the blister heal.You should also try to stay off your feet as much as possible while the blister is healing.
Try changing your socks twice a day to help decrease the possibility of blisters, usually cotton socks are better than polyester.
 Unless a blister becomes extremely painful, it's best not to drain it yourself. This can increase your likelihood of developing an infection. Let the blister's skin peel on its own. Avoid touching or irritating the blister to prevent it from popping prematurely.Use a moleskin over the blister to protect it if you must walk on it.

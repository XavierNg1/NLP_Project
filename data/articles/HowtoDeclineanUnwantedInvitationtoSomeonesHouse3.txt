 This opens doors to people believing that they are close enough to know why you can't come. Unless you really want to have a strong, close friendship with this/these person/people, do not ever tell them why! This also sounds like you had to come up with some sort of reason not to come.


Here is an example email invite and decline:


Invite: "Tracey, How have you been? I am very excited about the upcoming ballet recital. We hope to see you there! I was thinking that it would be fun to get together sometime at my house. Let me know what days work for you. Thursday, Friday, and the 7th work for us. Let me know if you have any other days also! Jenny"

Decline: "Hello, Jenny! I'm looking forward to the recital also. Lilly is dragging me from store to store trying to find purple tights and green leotards! Hard to find! Thank you for the invitation. I am sorry, but I cannot make it. I really appreciate the offer I look forward to seeing Janice perform on Tuesday! How is your father-in-law's shoulder? We are all praying for him! Have a good weekend! Tracey"

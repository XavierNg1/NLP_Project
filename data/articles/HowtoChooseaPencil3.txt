 H-grade leads are the hardest leads. Ironic as it sounds, these leads do produce finer lines. They're not as easy to sharpen, but the crispness of the lead's edges lasts longer than softer leads. For the lightest quality, opt for 9H. If you prefer darker marks from a soft lead, use H., B-grade leads are the softest leads. Choose this variety if you want to sharpen the lead more quickly and easily. The down side is that they lose their crisp edges more quickly. Use 9B for the darkest quality lines and B for the lightest.If you're drawing, you might outline with a harder lead, then darken and shade with a softer lead.
 F (#2 Â½) is right in the middle of the hardness and darkness scale with the #2 lead. Like #2, it sharpens to a fine point. Its line quality is only slightly lighter and harder.While this lead is safe for drawing and general writing, it's not recommended for standardized tests. Not all test readers will give accurate results for even a slight variation from #2.

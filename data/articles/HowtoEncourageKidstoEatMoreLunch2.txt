 It could be your child is not eating their lunch because their tastes have changed or they’re simply bored with what you’re packing for them. Ask your child if there are any specific foods they’d like you to pack and, if it’s feasible, provide those foods.


For example, maybe your kid hasn’t been eating their sandwich because they don’t like the type of bread you’ve been putting it on. Making the sandwich on the type of bread your child prefers could fix the problem.If you’re having trouble getting your child to pick foods that are feasible to pack for lunch, try giving them two choices and allowing them to pick between the two. For example, ask them, “Do you want an apple or orange for your fruit?” Or, “Would you like your sandwich on wheat bread or in a wrap?” This will allow you to control the types of foods they eat, but still involve them in the process., In addition to letting your child help pick out what foods they want in their lunch, they may be more motivated to eat it if they also get to help assemble and pack it. After your child has helped you choose what to take in their lunch, get everything out and ask them to help you pack it into their lunchbox. This can give your child a sense of pride and a boost of confidence.


Depending on their age, your child may not be able to help with every aspect of packing their lunch. For example, you probably don’t want your preschooler wielding a knife to cut their sandwich in half. Have them help with what they can, like bagging up fruits and veggies and arranging everything inside their lunchbox., You can also let your child choose how they’d like to carry their lunch—in a lunchbox or a brown paper bag, for example. Allowing them to choose a new lunchbox might make them more interested in what’s inside. Or, maybe they’ve outgrown the cartoon lunchbox they carried last year and are embarrassed to take it to the cafeteria.

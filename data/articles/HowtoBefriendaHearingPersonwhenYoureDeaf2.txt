 For a friendship to grow, both people need to talk about themselves. After you’ve established a rapport with your new friend, you can slowly start to introduce more personal topics of conversation. Don’t rush it, though – you don’t want to seem overeager.The first few times you hang out with your new friend, keep your conversation light and focused on your mutual interests. If that goes well, you can start introducing deeper topics like your family life and hopes for the future.
 While you and your friend are still getting to know each other, be careful not to ask them for too much time or emotional energy. Do your best to gauge what they want out of the friendship, and act accordingly. If you act too needy, you risk scaring your friend away.Not everyone will become a best friend, and that’s okay. Try to enjoy every friendship for what it is.
Regardless of how deep your friendship becomes, it’s reasonable to expect that your new friend will treat you with respect and make an effort to communicate in a way that works for you. If they don’t do this, you’re probably better off finding other friends.
 Make an effort to be there for your friend when they need company or advice, and turn to them when you need support yourself. Let your friend know that you appreciate them.Keep in mind that it takes effort from both people to create a healthy sense of give and take. Do your part, but don’t blame yourself if your friend doesn’t hold up their end of the bargain.

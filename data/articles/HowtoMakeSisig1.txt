 Feel free to adjust the ingredients a bit to your taste. For example, you can add 1/2 cup of white vinegar for a tangier pork, or a 1/2 cup of sugar for a sweeter dish.


You can also add 1 cup or aromatic herbs like lemongrass.;
, You want to make sure there is 3-4 inches of room between the top of the pot and the water, but there is enough water to cover the pork completely.
 Heat the pot on high until the water is boiling, then turn the heat down to bring the pot to a simmer.


You only need to bring the water to a boil briefly.
A simmer is when bubbles briefly and slowly break the surface of the water.
 You don't want the meat to be soft, just tender on the outside. You'll be cooking it again later.
 Drain the water from the pot and separate the meat from the onions, garlic, etc. You can throw away the water and remaining ingredients.


If you know how, you can also save the liquid to make stock.
 Using skewers to hold it together, cook the meat on a high-heat grill until the outside of the meat is browned and crispy.


Traditionally, sisig is made on a charcoal grill with the meat close to the coals., Once you've taken the meat off the grill, let it cool. Place it in a covered bowl and refrigerate it for 24 hours before continuing.


While chilling the meat for a day is best, you can chill it for 3-4 hours if you do not have enough time.

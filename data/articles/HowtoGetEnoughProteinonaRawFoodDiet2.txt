 Although many people who follow a raw diet are vegans, both vegetarians and omnivores also follow the raw food diet. If you are an omnivore, you can enjoy raw fish dishes such as sashimi and ceviche. Both of these are high in protein and can provide a much needed boost to your plant-based protein sources.Choose sashimi, which is usually thinly sliced fish. In most cases, salmon and tuna are the types of fish used.Salmon sashimi has 5.6 g per ounce and white tuna has 7.2 g per ounce. You can also try sashimi made from eel at 6.7 g per ounce or sardine, which has 7 g per ounce.Make ceviche, which is a Latin American dish of raw fish or seafood marinated in citrus juice.A ¼ cup of ceviche has 13 g of protein., Carpaccio is an Italian delicacy that is made of thin slices of raw meat such as beef.A 3 ounce serving of beef carpaccio has 25 g of protein.Keep in mind that eating raw or undercooked meat can cause serious illness or even death., Milk, cheese, and other dairy products such as yogurt are all very high in protein, but for many raw dieters, they’re off limits because the process of pasteurization heats dairy to remove pathogenic bacteria.If you would like to boost your protein, consider trying raw dairy products.Animal milks have 8 g of protein per 8 ounces.Locate local farms and stores that sell raw milk and milk products by using an online sites such as Agrilicious at http://www.agrilicious.org/local/raw-milk. A Campaign for Real Milk can also help you find local farms that sell unpasteurized dairy products at http://www.realmilk.com/real-milk-finder/.
Raw, unpasteurized milk is illegal in some states.Vary your dairy options by choosing different milks and milk products such as cow, goat, and sheep.
Keep in mind that consuming unpasteurized dairy products can expose you to dangerous bacteria including Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria. All of these can cause serious illness.Pregnant women are strongly discouraged from consuming raw dairy.

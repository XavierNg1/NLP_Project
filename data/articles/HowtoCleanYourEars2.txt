 If you can't clear the blockage on your own, make an appointment with a medical professional. He or she can tell you in a couple seconds if you have a blockage, and perform a quick procedure to flush your ears. You might be experiencing the following symptoms:


Persistent earaches.
Muffled hearing.
A feeling of fullness in your ear.
 To manage long-term earwax problems, your doctor may suggest using over-the-counter solutions containing carbamide peroxide every four to eight weeks.


Brands using carbamide peroxide include Murine, Debrox, Auro, Mack's, and GoodSense.
Your doctor may also suggest prescription ear drops containing trolamine polypeptide oleate, or Cerumenex., The doctor may flush your ears with a water pick or bulb-type syringe to clean out smaller blockages (lavage), or may remove larger blockages in part with an instrument called a curette or by using suction. It doesn't hurt at all, and in just a few minutes, your ears will be safely and thoroughly cleanedâ€”and your hearing will be startlingly better.
 Talk to your doctor or an ear, nose and throat specialist (ENT) if you have frequent and troublesome buildups of earwax.

 You can often find already made maze items specifically intended for use by rabbits. There are websites online that carry these items, but you can also check in your local pet store to see what they carry in stock.


You will likely have to do a little assembly to put the maze together.
 A popular toy for pet rabbits (and many other types of pets) is the tunnel. This toy gives your rabbit a chance to explore in narrow spaces, an activity that they really enjoy. These types of toys will also help keep your bunny out of smaller spaces that you would prefer it avoid – like under your furniture.To create a maze with a tunnel toy, you simply need to stick several of them together in a pattern of some sort. You can use Velcro or tape, depending on the material your tunnel toys are made out of.Combine the tunnel toys in various ways to make a fun and interesting maze for your rabbit.
If you can’t find any tunnel toys made specifically for rabbits, you can use some that were made for cats. These tunnel toys will be easier to find., You can make an even more exciting maze for your pet rabbit by building one out of cardboard boxes and tunnel toys that you stick together in various ways.Where the tunnel will intersect with the cardboard box, you’ll need to trace the outline of the tunnel on the box and cut out the hold. That way, the tunnel will fit snugly into the side of the cardboard box and there won’t be any chance your bunny could escape out of the hole.

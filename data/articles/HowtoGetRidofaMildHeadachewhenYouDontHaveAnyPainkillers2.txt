 You might want to think twice before taking a bite out of the convenience store hot dog or bologna sandwich you packed for lunch. Processed meats contain nitrites and nitrates, which are linked to headaches.


If you absolutely must have a hot dog or your favorite luncheon meat, look for brands that are nitrite and nitrate free.
 Just about everyone loves making that early morning stop to his or her favorite coffee shop or indulging in his or her favorite chocolate treat. Unfortunately, both coffee and chocolate contain caffeine, and caffeine can trigger headaches or make them worse.


If you must have that morning (or even afternoon) cup of joe, reach for the decaffeinated option.
Sadly, foods containing caffeine aren’t the only headache triggers. You should also avoid consuming artificially flavored foods that contain aspartame and fermented meats, cheese, and nuts, which contain tyramine, a naturally occurring compound known to cause headaches.
 Sometimes it is difficult to get in the daily recommended six to eight glasses of water. But did you know that keeping hydrated can help lessen a headache?


Even mild dehydration can cause headaches, as well fatigue and trouble concentrating. Being thirsty is oftentimes your body’s way of letting you know that you are already dehydrated, even if you have not yet developed a headache . Avoid this by drinking plenty of fluids all throughout your day.

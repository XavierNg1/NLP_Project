 Grabbing a hold of them is always the first response to someone grabbing your hair. Get control of their wrist and hold it close to your head to prevent damage and loss of bodily control.
 Your one hand grabs theirs, pulling closer to prevent them from yanking you around. As you do, strike out with the other hand right at their elbow. Aim just a little higher up, where the joint meets the bicep, for the best response.


Hit with you knuckles for the hardest, most successful strike.
Press against the inside of your bicep, moving up until your find a sensitive spot that causes your arm to curl slightly when pressed. This is your target.
 As you pull close, you'll be taking a step with your outside foot. Over-exaggerate this step into a knee at your attacker, letting your knee hit soon after you punch their arm.
 Once they let go and the knee connects, step back and use this time to escape.

 Combine the hoisin sauce, honey, five-spice powder, minced garlic, and grated ginger in a small mixing bowl. Whisk together until evenly mixed.


This sauce does not need to be thickened with heat.
If you'd rather not use freshly minced garlic or freshly grated ginger, you can use their powdered forms instead. Use only 1/8 tsp (0.6 ml) of each when opting for the ground and dried versions.
 Lightly brush this glaze over the ham immediately before baking it. Once the ham is halfway through its anticipated cooking time, apply the remainder of the glaze and continue baking the ham.


Note that you may need to quickly whisk the glaze together again prior to each application.
The exact times will vary depending on the weight of the ham. You'll usually need to bake ham for 15 to 20 minutes per 1 lb (450 g) at a temperature of 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius). For an 8-lb (3.6-kg) ham, you'll need to cook it for about 1 hour before reapplying the second coat; cook it for another 60 to 90 minutes after that.

 Curing occurs when you heat your stove to seal the silicone resin in the paint, which is what contains heat-resistant properties. Heat your wood stove to a temperature of 250 degrees F (121 degrees C) for 20 minutes. Turn the heat off and allow the stove to cool.
 Reheat your stove to a temperature of 250 degrees F (121 degrees C) a second time, and allow it to remain on for 20 minutes. Turn it off and allow it to cool.
 Heat the stove to 460 degrees F (237 degrees C) for 45 minutes. Turn it off and allow it to cool.

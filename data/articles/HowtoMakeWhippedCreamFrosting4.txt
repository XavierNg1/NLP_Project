 Puree berries or strawberries. Add about 2 1/4 cups puree for every 3 cups of cream.
 Again, use the same amount. Make sure that the fruit flavor isn't overwhelming for the cake flavor though.


Fruit juice can be used too. For example, add 1/2 cup orange or lemon juice, preferably freshly squeezed, to the cream.
 Add 1/4 cup quality cocoa powder and 6 tablespoons (88.7Â ml) of sugar to counteract the chocolate's bitterness. This one needs to sit in the refrigerator for at least an hour to allow to cocoa to dissolve properly.

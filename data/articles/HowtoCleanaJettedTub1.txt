 If you didn't panic and drain that tub the moment you saw the gunk, don't! If you did, no problem—fill the tub with hot water to approximately 4 inches (10 cm) above the highest jets.;
, This will ensure that only water is going through the pipes instead of being mixed with air. Some feel that opening up the air induction port is more effective, as it increases the turbulence. If your tub has cleaning instructions, follow the guidelines listed there.
 Use about 1/4 cup (50ml) of a low-foaming surfactant such as powdered dishwasher detergent to the water. Cascade Complete is a good choice—it's based on enzymatic action rather than acidic action. Acidic detergent will eventually strip the sealant on the brass, and it will tarnish. In an emergency, though, any dishwashing detergent will work.
 Bleach is an excellent disinfectant. Some manufacturers do not recommend bleach as it may eventually dry out the internal gaskets. In an emergency, it'll work well. Then check with your tub's manufacturer to see what they recommend for ongoing maintenance.
 Set the jets to the highest pressure, and turn it on. Be of strong stomach—you will probably see some nasty stuff jetting out. This is good: it's better than lingering in your pipes.
 Clean out the residue, and refill it with cold water—above the jets again.
 You want to rinse everything out, thoroughly.
 Clean it thoroughly—it should be ready to use now.
 Fill the tub back up with steamy water. (You can hit the jets for a test, if you like—no more surprises!) Dim the lights, relight the candles, turn on the music, pour another glass of wine, power up the jets, and slip into bliss. You earned it!

 If you are not at home or if your mom is not at home right now, then you can also give your mom a call or send her a text message. Just call or text to chat. Try asking how her day is going and letting her know that you are thinking about her.If you send her a text, try adding a smiley face or heart emoji to brighten the message.
 Posting a message for your mom that all of her friends will also be able to see and comment on can help to cheer up your mom.Try posting something that you know will make her smile, such as a silly cat picture, a movie-related meme, or even just a sincere compliment.
 Inviting your mom to go and do something with you is also a good way to cheer her up. Try inviting her to do something that you know she will enjoy.


For example, if your mom enjoys biking, then you can ask your mom to go for a bike ride with you. If your mom is a fan of shopping, you can ask her to meet you at the mall. Or if she is a foodie, then you can ask her to go out to lunch with you at a new restaurant., Buying or making a small gift for your mom can also help to brighten her day.Try drawing her a picture, getting her a bag of her favorite candies, or picking some pretty wildflowers and putting them into a vase to surprise her when she gets home.

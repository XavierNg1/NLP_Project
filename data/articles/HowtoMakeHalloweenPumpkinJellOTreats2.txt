 Choose ones without blemishes. Wash well, to remove any soil or chemicals.
 This will make the "guts" of the pumpkin.
 Allow it to set.


If you want a variety of colors for separate oranges, make up different colors in different bowls.



Slice the top off each orange.
Spoon out the orange flesh until you are just left with the orange peel "shell". (You can use the orange flesh for another dish, or just eat it as part of a fruit salad.) Do for each orange being prepared.
Carve the oranges. Use a sharp kitchen knife to carve out grins and eyes on one side of the orange, just the same as you'd do for a pumpkin. Repeat for each orange you're making.
 Use a fork or butter knife to roughly chop it up.
 Pack it in well, it doesn't matter if it's higher than the orange, that's just the pumpkin's "brains". Repeat for each orange you're making, varying Jell-O or jelly colors if you're making more than one color.


The lid of each orange can be placed back on top if wished.
 Pop back in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve the Jack O'Lantern orange-pumpkins filled with Jell-O guts. Yum, yum.

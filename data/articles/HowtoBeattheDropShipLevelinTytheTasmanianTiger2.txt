 This level will not be easy to beat, chances are. If you have tons of patience, than continue to the next steps. If you don't, than do not continue until you do.;
, If you are not, then go to the area where the boarded wood is (like the picture on the right). Use your Battle Bunyip to break the wooden doors and destroy the lizards in the next set of wooden doors.
 Go on the area where the green arrow is pointing down and a screen should come up about how to control the Bunyip. Study the screen carefully. Than click X to control the bynip.
 The area that is circled is the area where the Battle Bunyip is. Shoot your bullets at the Bunyip. Keep shooting and do not let the Bunyip shoot you.

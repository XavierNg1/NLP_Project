 Unlike the pap test, the HPV can directly detect the presence of HPV. However, it cannot detect any damage that the virus, if present, may already have inflicted upon the cervix (which the pap test can do).
 The test is administered similarly to the pap test by using a small brush to collect cells during a speculum exam.
 Usually women do not need to get an HPV test before the age of 30. This is because the body can often fight off an HPV infection on its own. After age 30, it is recommended that women get an HPV test in addition to a pap smear every 5 years.

 There are many sites on the internet which offer an empty calendar template to which you can upload your own personal photographs. All you need to do is pick your calendar template (there are often many to choose from), upload your chosen photographs, and assign each photograph to a particular month. This is a great option if you want a personalized calendar with a polished, professional-looking finish.


Some sites give you the option of printing out each page of the calendar and putting it together yourself, while others will have it professionally printed and bound and delivered right to your door.
If you are printing the calendar yourself, some sites will charge a small fee for the use of their templates, while others offer them for free. If you are having your photo calendar printed and delivered by the company, you can expect to pay between $15 and $30.
Websites such as Shutterfly, Snapfish, and Lulu all offer an extensive range of options.
 You can make a simple arts and crafts calendar using a calendar pad - a small yearly calendar that you can buy in most craft stores or online. To make this calendar:


Simply take a piece of colored card, turn it so it is facing vertically, and glue your chosen picture at the top, using a glue stick.
Then attach the calendar pad to the bottom, also using the glue stick.
You can then decorate any available space on the card with drawings, sequins, feathers, glitter, etc.
This a great, easy crafts project for younger children.

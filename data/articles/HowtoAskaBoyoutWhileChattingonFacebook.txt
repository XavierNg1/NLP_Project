 Start with a friendly greeting like "Hi, how are you?" You could try cracking a few jokes or reminisce about how much fun you two had at school that day. You could try to mention something fun you did; e.g "BTW, remember when we...?" Try to build a sense of closeness with him. This will strengthen the bond between the two of you, and also relax both him and you a little!;
, If he does it's a pretty clear sign he's into you, if he doesn't it doesn't always mean he doesn't like you. If he starts showing signs of being uncomfortable with what you are saying, back off and give some space.
 If he flirts back and is acting interested then it's the perfect time to finally do what you've been waiting for! Ask him if he would like to be your boyfriend or of you want to go on a date. A simple "Will you go out with me?" will do the trick.
 This is optional, you two don't have to go on dates to go out. If you're young make sure you have parental permission first. Ask him if he'd like to go swimming or do some other seasonal activity with you. A movie, though clich√©, is always an option too. Find a time and day that works for the two of you and date away! If he indicates that he is not interested in you, leave him. There are many other boys out there!

, And friends are important!

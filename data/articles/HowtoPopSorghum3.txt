 Because sorghum is lighter than popcorn, hot air poppers will generally not work for popping sorghum. Some hot air poppers, however, are acceptable. If your hot air popper blows air up and out of the machine, do not attempt to pop sorghum with it. If your hot air popper blows hot air in a circular pattern within the machine, use it to pop sorghum.Check your hot air popper’s user manual to determine if popping sorghum is possible.
Alternately, you could cover your hot air popper with a mesh net of the sort used when steaming vegetables. This will prevent your sorghum kernels from escaping the hot air popper, even if it is of the variety that blows hot air up and out from the center., This will give the hot air popper time to warm up. If you add sorghum kernels to the hot air popper before it’s warm, the kernels will dry out and be unable to pop properly., Turn your hot air popper off and sorghum kernels in a volume that is appropriate for your hot air popper. Turn the hot air popper on and listen for the sorghum to start popping. When popping slows to once every five seconds or so, turn the machine off and dump the popped sorghum into a bowl.Different hot air poppers have different limits. Check your user manual for information regarding what an appropriate weight or volume of sorghum kernels might be in your device.
You may see a bit of smoke even when your sorghum is popping within the prescribed times. Monitor the sorghum and remove it from the hot air popper after popping slows.

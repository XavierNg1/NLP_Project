 Buildup from your typical shampoo or conditioner may be coating your scalp and causing it to itch.Purchase a new shampoo and conditioner—preferably ones that contain natural ingredients, such as tea tree oil, coconut oil, jojoba, or zinc pyrithione.Look for healthy shampoos at a local supermarket or health-food store.;
, Perfumes in hair-care products can irritate your scalp and cause it to itch. When shopping, look for products that state “fragrance free” on the label. If you can’t find fragrance-free products, look for ones that state “hypoallergenic” on the label.You can also try using a hair-care product that is designed for babies or individuals with sensitive skin.
 Brush or comb your hair two to three times per day to distribute natural oils, paying special attention to the scalp. Brushing your hair with a clean, soft hairbrush promotes blood flow and spreads natural oils to alleviate an itchy scalp.Brush gently. Aggressive, harsh brushing may scratch or irritate your scalp and cause the itching to worsen.
 Keeping alcohol off of your scalp is also the most effective method to cut back on dandruff (which itself is a sign of an itchy scalp). Hair-care products that are high in alcohol can also lead to (or worsen the effects of) itchy and painful skin conditions on your scalp, including eczema, sebborhea, and seborrheic dermatitis.Alcohol is a powerful drying agent, and it can easily dry out your scalp and cause it to itch badly.
 Coconut oil creates a barrier that helps keep skin moisturized, and hence it is an effective way to treat an itchy scalp. To apply, rub a little coconut oil onto your scalp when it is clean (after you have washed your hair). Leave the oil on for at least half an hour, and then wash your hair with a perfume-free shampoo.Follow this remedy three times a week.

Another option is to gently heat coconut oil so that it melts. Add it to your shampoo before washing your hair.

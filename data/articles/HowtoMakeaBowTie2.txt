 Scraps or quarters from the fabric store would work great. You will need about 1/4 of a yard.










The first piece should be cut into a 5”x7” rectangle. Altering this measurement will change the size of the bow tie, so adjust accordingly if you want the bow tie to be larger or smaller, but try to keep the proportion the same.
The second piece should be a 2.25” x 2.25” square. This is going to be the ring around the middle of the bow tie.
Use a complementing or contrasting fabric for the smaller square to make a wackier bow tie.










Fold the larger rectangle into thirds length-wise, so that the fabric print is facing out on both sides. Either sew or glue the seam. (Fabric glue or hot glue would work).
Fold the smaller piece of fabric into thirds and iron or glue to hold the shape. Fold the ends of the large rectangle in to meet each other in the middle. Sew or use a little glue to keep them in place.
Use a ruler to find the very center of the rectangle.
Pinch the middle of the fabric together. Use a few dabs of fabric or hot glue to hold the fabric together, or tie a piece of thread or thin string around the pinched center to hold the bow’s shape.
Wrap the smaller piece around the center of your bow and secure it with glue or a stitch or two in the back of the bow.



Attach a clip to the back of the bow tie using hot glue. A safety pin may also work, but be sure to fasten it to the clothing before putting the shirt on the baby.
The bow tie may be sewn onto a onesie or shirt with just a couple of easy stitches.

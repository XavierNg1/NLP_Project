 Once you enter the Soul Cairn in the quest “Beyond Death,” you will need to follow the path that lies before you. Follow this dirt path until you come across a soul in the middle of the path yelling, “Arvak, Arvak!” He will immediately talk to you once you are close by.;
, The frantic soul will explain how he wants you to locate Arvak in the Soul Cairn. He explains how Arvak and he entered the realm but were attacked by monsters. He then told Arvak to run, and the horse has been running ever since. Once the soul informs you of the situation, he will disappear.
 Once the soul has disappeared, you will need to follow the path you were following before. This will lead you to the Boneyard, which is located at the end of the path.
 The Boneyard is a massive fortress with large stone walls. Once you reach the Boneyard, you will need to head directly east until you see a small altar with stone pillars.
 As you make your way east, you will come across a structure with four pillars and a roof on top made of stone. In the middle of this altar you will see a pedestal with the skull sitting on top.
 The pedestal will be in the center of the small altar with Arvak’s skull lying on top. A handful of Mistmen will appear when you are close to the altar. Use any weapon you have on you to clear these out before picking up the skull.
 Once you pick up the skull, the frantic soul from earlier will appear beside the altar.
 The frantic soul will teach you how summon Arvak any time you wish in Skyrim. This is a spell that the soul will teach you (simply by speaking with him) and can be equipped in your Magic inventory.

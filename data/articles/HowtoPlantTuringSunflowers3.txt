 You should get a good display of sunflowers by the late summer. After that, the flower heads will fade and the petals wither. If you are a generous wildlife gardener, it’s beneficial to birds to leave the plants where they are so the birds can enjoy eating the seeds.


Alternately you can cut the flowerheads and put them on a bird table.
 Sunflowers, especially giant varieties, leave a woody stalk behind. Cut this stalk to about knee height with a small hand saw. Then either pull it out of the ground or dig it out. You can compost the stems.
 Sunflowers may self-seed. If you don’t want volunteer (self-sown) sunflowers in your garden the following year, sweep up any seeds you see.


To stop them from scattering, you may like to lay a sheet under the plants to catch any dropped seeds as you remove the flowerheads and the rest of the plant. Or you can hoe the area when the young seedlings emerge to kill them off.

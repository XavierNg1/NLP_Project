 You can use it as a compression bandage to reduce swelling or bleeding.You want a sock that has at least a half-crew or mid-calf length leg. Ankle socks, heel socks and no-shows will not work for this type of bandage. The leg should have strong elastic that has not been over-stretched. It should be tight when pulled over an arm or a leg.
 You should cut just below the ankle or along the “foot-pit” of the sock. You can throw away the rest of the sock or recycle it.
 If you are using this bandage for your hand or wrist, you may want a thumb-hole. Resting the sock lengthwise against your hand, mark where your thumb lies. Cut out a circle roughly one or two inches in diameter and try it on for size.
 Try not to have the fabric rub against the wound as you do so; you may need to stretch out the sock with your fingers so that it is not touching the wound until it is in position.

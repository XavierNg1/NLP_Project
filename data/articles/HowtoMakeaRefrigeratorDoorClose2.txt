 This procedure will vary depending on the make and model of your refrigerator.


Consult your refrigerator's manual to determine how the door hinges can be tightened. If you do not have the manual, contact the manufacturer directly or visit their website to obtain contact information or a copy of the manual.
Most hinges can be accessed by opening the refrigerator and freezer doors, and will contain hinge caps that can be removed or pried off with a screwdriver.



Use a screwdriver or similar tool as required to properly tighten the door hinges.
 You may need to place shims between your hinges and the refrigerator door if the door is still loose or refuses to close completely.


Shims made specifically for refrigerators can be purchased from retail stores that specialize in home repair or refrigerators. You can also use pieces of cardboard in place of metal or stainless steel shims.
In some cases, you may need to remove shims that have not been properly installed in order to correct sagging or alignment problems with the door.
If your refrigerator door contains a magnet catch that doesn't work, remove the magnet catch and place a shim underneath to allow the door to properly seal and close.

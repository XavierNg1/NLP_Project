 It’s important to use very fresh roses if you are harvesting petals. If you are harvesting your own roses, make sure the bush is hydrated before you cut the flowers. To do this, water the plant the night before you cut the flowers.;
, Use a sharp knife to cut the stem. A clean cut means the stem will absorb water better than if you inflict a crushing cut from a blunt tool.


Try to make a diagonal (slanting) cut rather than a straight, square one. Doing this increases the area of cell tissue exposed to water so that the stem can drink more.
 It’s important the rose petals are dry when you store them. If this is unavoidable, lay the petals out on a clean dry towel after harvesting and gently pat them dry.
 Place your cut flowers in cool water in a clean container such as a vase until you are ready to use them. It’s a good idea to keep the vase in as cool a position as possible. A cool cellar or garage works well; at the very least store the vase away from direct sunlight and drafts.


You should avoid placing the vase near electrical appliances such as TVs as these emit heat. Try to change the water every other day.
 Try to use a young, slightly closed rose bloom for taking petals rather than a fully open one or any bloom that is starting to drop petals voluntarily. However, don’t use buds that are too young and tightly closed. The bloom should be just about to open.

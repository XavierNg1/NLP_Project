 Chemical rust removers usually contain a strong acid. This acid can burn your bare skin and gives off harmful fumes. Always work with chemicals in a well-ventilated area. Wear rubber gloves, safety googles, a suitable air mask, and clothing that covers your entire body., Fully immerse rusted steel in the rust removing chemicals according to the removerâ€™s label directions. In most cases, soaking for 8 hours or overnight will allow enough time for the chemical to remove most rust.


Some brands may require varying lengths of time to work most effectively. To ensure the best results, always follow the label directions.
Light rust won't need to be soaked for as long as heavy rust. Soak lightly rusted metal for 1 to 3 hours., Larger objects may be impossible to submerge in the chemicals. For these items, choose a gel based chemical rust remover. Paint the remover onto rusted surfaces with a paintbrush or applicator and wait the time indicated on the label., Use a putty knife or a similar tool to scrape off rust from the surface of the metal. Wipe away remaining chemicals or rust with a suitable rag dampened with water. With the rust and chemicals removed, you should be able to determine the amount of rust remaining, if any., When treating a heavily rusted object, expect to apply chemicals several times before the rust is fully removed. When the rust is gone, rinse the metal in cool water and then dry it with a towel.

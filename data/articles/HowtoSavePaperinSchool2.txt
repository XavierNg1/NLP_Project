 Local businesses often have reams of unused paper goods that might include outdated letterhead, envelopes of the wrong size and old signs. Ask companies in your neighborhood or your parents' places of business to donate these paper goods to your school. (In many cases, it's tax-deductible!)

, Besides being better for the environment, recycled paper products can be less expensive, too. You can also find products made from non-tree sources such as hemp, bamboo, banana, kenaf and crushed stone.
 Ask your administration to forgo product catalogs and purchase supplies from companies that have websites or page-flipping catalogs and online ordering. Encourage your school to eliminate paper promotional materials and put all newsletters and catalogs online themselves.
 You can purchase notebooks made from recycled paper. Once you do, go a few steps further in your paper-saving efforts and use both sides of the paper. Write smaller (but still large enough for you to read what you've written) and avoid leaving a lot of white space on the page.


Don't do silly things with paper such as passing notes, making airplanes or spitballs or throwing it at your classmates' heads. These activities are both paper-wasting and trouble-making.
 Rather than work out math equations or create brainstorm lists or do other in-class activities on paper, students could use small white boards with ultra low-odor dry-erase markers. Some marker brands are even made from recycled materials and are refillable, too.
 Paper products are used in the kitchen, cafeteria and restrooms at school, so strategies for reducing paper waste should take these areas into account as well.


Be sure your school is buying napkins, paper towels and bathroom tissue made from recycled paper.
Lobby for hand dryers instead of paper towels.
Post reminder "These Come From Trees" stickers on napkin and paper towel dispensers to help remind people to reduce unnecessary use.

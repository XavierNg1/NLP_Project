 Some people are born with freckles, but many others develop them over time as a result of sun exposure. They may fade during the winter, but they come back darker every summer if you don't take precautions to keep the sun's rays off of your skin.


Use plenty of sunscreen. Make sure you cover your face every couple of hours while you're out in the sun, and more often if you're going swimming. Use a strong sunscreen on the rest of your body as well, since freckles can develop anywhere.
Wear a hat and other protective clothing. Sunscreen can only to so far to protect your skin from the sun. Having a layer of clothing over your skin is a much more effective way to prevent freckles from forming. Wear light, airy long-sleeved shirts and pants during the summer to keep cool and protect your skin at the same time.
 Citrus fruits, kiwis, spinach, and other leafy greens are all excellent sources of vitamin C.


Start your day with a burst of vitamin C with a fruit and vegetable smoothie. Add a kiwi, a nectarine, and a cup of raw spinach to your blender. Puree the produce with almond milk or another healthy base.
Vitamin C supplements are another option you can choose to make sure you're getting enough. Take pure vitamin C or a multivitamin that contains it.

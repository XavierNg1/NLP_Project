 Catfish are less active when the water is cold, so the best time to start fishing is when water levels rise and the water warms to about fifty degrees in the spring. You can continue fishing until it gets cold again.









Experiment to find the best time of year to go catfishing in your region. In some places the season may start earlier, and in other places the water doesn't warm up until early summer.
Blue catfish, which live in the Southern United States, are active all winter long, so you don't have to pause during the colder months if you're fishing in that region.
 Catfish are more active very early in the morning, so plan to start your fishing expedition before sunrise, or even earlier. They tend to feed during these hours.


Fishing at night can also yield a large catch. If you like to stay up all night on the water, try fishing starting around one or two in the morning.
You might find some catfish later in the day if it's overcast or raining, but if there's full sun, the fish are likely to be less active.
 Catfish like to dwell in places where a current meets a still area, so they can rest without fighting the current. "Covered" areas can be found where the current hits a large log or rock, usually near the bank of a river. Other resting places might be found near dams or other man-made structures in the water.


In smaller rivers and streams, look for eddies created by rocks and fallen logs toward the middle of the water.
If you're fishing in a pond or reservoir, look for areas near feeder creeks, very deep spots, and fallen logs and boulders.
 Once you've chosen the spot where you want to start fishing, drop your anchor, set up your equipment, cast your line and wait for a bite.

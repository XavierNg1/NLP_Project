 Similar to when playing games such as Netball or Basketball, team leaders (captains of two teams) will have to choose their team. there must be an even number of people on each team but it doesn't matter how many people there are. Balance Ball is a game for large groups so it really doesn't matter if there are lots of people.
 For this one, it really doesn't matter what type of ball it is as long as it is small and round like a tennis ball, but it has to be soft because you have to be hitting people with it.
 This game doesn't have a particular time limit so it just goes on until you want to stop. Basically, the teams have to decide who is going in first. If for example, if the Blue team is going in first, the Red team would have to choose two people to stand on each side of a distance of your choice. Don't make it too far away though because then the other two might not be able to throw the ball far enough.

After all that, one person in the Blue team is going to stand in the middle of the two people who are standing from a distance. One of those two people will hold the ball. They have to try to hit the middle person from the opponent team with the ball and the middle is obviously gonna have to balance by moving away from the ball and running to the other side.
For example: the Red team has the ball. The person standing on the right hand side of the distance will throw the ball to the person on the left hand side but will also try to hit the person in the middle. The middle person will move to the other side. Basically, the middle person can only stand next to the person without the ball, otherwise they will be hit.
If the ball is on the right, they run to the left and if the ball is on the left, they run back to the right, still making sure the ball doesn't touch them. If the ball touches any part of their body, they are out and another person from the same team would come in until everyone in the Blue team is out. Then they swap.

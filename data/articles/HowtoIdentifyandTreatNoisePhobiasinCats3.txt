 Desensitizing training works best when your cat is trained to take commands, which is relatively rare. If your cat cannot take commands, this method is only likely to cause more stress. , Reward it every time that it responses correctly to the command, until it has mastered the command. , Play a recording of a sound that frightens your cat at a very low volume. Command your cat to relax, and reward it with a treat if it remains relaxed. Do not reward it if it fails to follow through. If the cat cannot remain calm, try playing the sound at a lower volume next time. Find a volume that the cat is comfortable with and get it accustomed to the noise. , Once the cat has successfully followed the command, increase the volume slightly the next time you practice. Repeat this training exercise at least once a week, progressively increasing the volume. , When an actual storm comes through, command your cat to relax. Reward your cat if it follows through with the command. Do not reward it if it fails to follow the command.

 You can reproduce these over and over again in a "factory" manner, getting an almost perfect, if not exact, duplicate.


"CNC" stands for Computer Numerical Control. The specs of your replica would be loaded into a computer processor, which would then guide the cutting.
You can buy these machines in a variety of models and makes. Some use a laser to do the cutting, others use cutting tools or even plasma cutters. Most machines of this kind cost upwards of $60,0000 so turning your carving over to a professional (also called a milliner) for mass duplication on one of these machines is probably your best bet.
One advantage to the CNC machine is you are not limited in materials. You can make metal, plastic or even stone duplicates of you source object.;

 A live trap usually contains a trap door, a trap mechanism, and pulleys. It can be found online or at your local farm and feed store. It is primarily used to catch rabbits while keeping them alive.
 Again, corn, carrots, vegetables, or bread should be sufficient to lure rabbits into the trap, after which the trap door gets activated and the rabbit is caught.


Be sure to place the food directly on the trap mechanism. If it's improperly placed, there's a good chance your rabbit could slip loose with a full belly and you'll have nothing to show for it.
 Follow the directions that come with the live trap in order to set it. Make sure that the trap activates by probing the trap mechanism with a long stick. If the trap doesn't activate, be sure to set it again until it does.
 Any caught rabbits shouldn't be able to hurt themselves in the trap, but it's humane to check for a catch at least every 24 hours.
 Be sure to wear protective gloves if you do catch a rabbit. Though they are generally harmless, they could try to bite you in your effort to set them free.

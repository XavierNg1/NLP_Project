Pinks, and most pastels look nice against lighter skin tones.
 Before you start painting, add a medium to thick layer of vaseline on the skin around your nail. Try not to get any on the nail, or you will have a hard time getting the nail polish to stay.
 If you want to add a design, do it now. Don't worry if you get some paint on your skin; the vaseline will keep it from sticking!

, While not necessary, this will help seal your nail polish and keep it from chipping.
 When they are completely dry, grab a cotton swab and use it to wipe away the vaseline.
 This will help remove any vaseline that the cotton swab didn't get.
 You should be free of smudges anywhere that the vaseline touched.

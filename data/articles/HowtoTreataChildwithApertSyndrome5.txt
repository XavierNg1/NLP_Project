 One of the most common surgical treatments for this condition is reconstruction surgery. During the surgery, the prematurely fused bones will be separated and your child’s head will be reshaped so that the brain can develop normally. This is done by installing body-friendly plates into your child’s skull that will be spontaneously absorbed into the bones over time.


This surgery is typically done between the ages of 6 to 12 months. So far, there hasn’t been any conclusive studies showing that it makes a difference if the surgery is done before 6 months of age.
 Sometimes, the eye sockets of a child with Apert syndrome can be so malformed that the child’s eyes bulge out and become susceptible to infections that could ultimately lead to blindness. If this is the case with your child, you may want to consider surgery to repair the shallowness of your child’s eye sockets., The roof of the mouth serves as a barrier between the nose and mouth. Cleft palate cases pose problems because there is an incomplete barrier. Infections from the nose may reach the mouth and vice versa. Choking becomes more frequent as well. Therefore, the barrier must be restored through surgery.
 Before even considering this, it is important to know that this surgery is almost exclusively done for aesthetic purposes only--the ability to use the fingers and toes is usually not able to be restored. Surgeons can, however, separate your child’s fingers and toes for aesthetic improvement.
 This surgical procedure reconstructs your child’s face so that the nose, eyes, and mouth function better. It can also correct the deformities that are caused by the syndrome, making your child’s face look more like children who do not have this syndrome.


This surgery is normally performed when your child is 6 to 8 years old.
The surgery can also be done that only focuses on your child’s nose--it makes the bridge of the nose more prominent.

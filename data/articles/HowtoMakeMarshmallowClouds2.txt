Quickly pour the mixture into the prepared pan, spreading it out with a spatula. Keep in mind it will set how you leave the top of it, so try to get it smooth. You can also just use your (oiled!) hands to smooth the top out., Add a dusting of powdered sugar on top of the marshmallows. Leave it alone so it can set up.It will take at least four hours, but you may want to leave it as long as a full day. You can leave it at room temperature., Once the mixture has set, add more powdered sugar to the top (use your hand to make sure it's coated), and then try to flip it out onto a surface. Sprinkle more powdered sugar on the other side., Dip a cloud cookie cutter into powdered sugar. Use the cookie cutter to cut clouds out of the block, trying to fit as many in as you can. If you don't have a cloud cookie cutter, you can freehand shapes with a knife. Cut the leftovers into small squares. Toss the marshmallows in more powdered sugar., To store the marshmallows, place them in an airtight container. They'll stay fresh about a week at room temperature. They may start to crystallize, but they are still okay to eat after that process begins.

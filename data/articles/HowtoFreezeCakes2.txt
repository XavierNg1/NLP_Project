 Before you can freeze your cake for later consumption, you must let it cool. Ideally, you should put your cake aside for about three hours. Lightly place your hand on it to make sure it's cool to the touch.


If you're freezing a store-bought cake, skip this first step.
 Most cakes will freeze well due to the fat content in them. If your cake doesn't have fat (like fat-free cakes), it won't freeze well and you should avoid putting it in the freezer.
 Your cake should ideally not touch any other foods while it freezes. If it does, it'll likely absorb the odor and flavor of those food items. This is why it might be a good idea to have an entire shelf or section reserved just for your cake.


Frosted cakes might also take up more space than unfrosted cakes, depending on how high the frosting is.
 Then, place it in the freezer unwrapped for about 4 hours. Then, remove the cake from the freezer.
 Try to cut a piece of foil that will nicely wrap around all sides of your frosted cake.
 Loosely cover your entire cake with plastic foil. Make sure that the whole cake is properly covered, but that you don't flatten the frosting too much.
 It's a good idea to add an additional layer of plastic foil around your cake to protect the shape and keep other odors in your freezer from sticking to your cake.
 You can also freeze the cake without the added protection of tupperware, but a plastic container will keep your cake in better shape. After wrapping the cake into plastic foil, put it into the plastic container and place it in the freezer.
 A cake will generally freeze well for a few months, but not more than that. Whilst freezing initially retains the moisture of a pre-baked cake, cakes will tend to dry out after two months of freezing and you can expect the flavor to change at around four months.

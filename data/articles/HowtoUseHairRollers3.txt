 You can use a variety of rollers for wet-setting hair. Mesh or velcro rollers are the easiest to roll, but may snag in thick or curly hair. Foam rollers are fairly easy to roll, but because they're spongy it may take longer for your curls to dry. Smooth magnetic clips will hold very tightly and produce well-defined curls, but are also the hardest to roll. Experiment until you find rollers that work for you and your hair.


Mesh and Velcro rollers should never be used in very wet hair. If you choose these types of rollers, you should air dry or blow dry your hair until it is slightly damp before using them.
 Because your hair will be drying under tension, it's helpful to use an extra-moisturizing shampoo and conditioner before wet-setting your hair. You can squeeze excess moisture from your hair in the shower, but don't towel-dry. Comb through wet hair.
 Part your hair at the left and right temples. You should have three sections: one over each ear and one at the top of your head. You can leave the back alone for now.
 Comb a section the width of your roller forward and then hold it up away from your head. Smooth a bit of hair gel or smoothing cream through that section. Then, rolling away from your face, wind the roller all the way down to your scalp. Secure it with a pin or clip.
 Section your hair bit by bit, smooth gel or cream through it, and roll the curls away from your face. If you want very small tight curls, use small rollers and put them close together. If you want larger curls, use larger rollers.
 If you want to avoid heat on your hair, allow your curls to fully air-dry before removing the rollers. This may take several hours or even overnight. You can also blow dry your hair with the rollers in. If you blow dry, allow the rollers to stay in about 15 minutes after you've dried your hair to cool and set the curls.

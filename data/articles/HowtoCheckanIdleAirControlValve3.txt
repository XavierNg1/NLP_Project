 Take a test light and connect the negative lead to the body of the vehicle. Press the test light into each of the four circuits on the GM idle control motor. Each circuit should make the test light flash or go from bright to dim while the engine is running.If the test light doesn’t flash on each circuit, the issue is coming from the ECU, not the idle control motor.
If the test light flashes properly, it means the idle control motor needs to be replaced.
 Locate the idle control motor in your Ford vehicle and identify the two electrical pins on the solenoid. Connect an Ohm meter to the two and measure the resistance between them.Fords are designed to operate with the resistance in the solenoid in a range between 7.0 to 13.0 ohms.
If the resistance is outside that range, the idle control motor needs to be replaced.
 Connect a bidirectional scan tool to the same OBD port you would plug a code scanner into. Use the command in the scan tool to increase the engine’s idle. If the engine idle does not increase, it means there is an issue at the idle control motor of its circuit preventing the signal from changing the idle.You can purchase a bidirectional scan tool at your local auto parts store.
Make sure the wiring harness is firmly connected to the idle control motor before conducting this test.

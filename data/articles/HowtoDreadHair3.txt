 Create a small section for each dread you want. The size of the section will determine the size of the dread. Use a small rubber band to keep the sections apart.
 Lift a section from your head and twist it, then use both hands to divide the end into two. Grasp one end in each hand and pull them in opposite directions. This action causes hair to ride up the shaft and get tangled and knotted.


As you pull the hair apart, the knots will move toward the roots and begin to pack there. Continue twisting the section, dividing it, pulling it, and twisting it again until the entire section of hair has become tangled and knotted.
Repeat until all sections of your hair have undergone the twisting, splitting and pulling from tip to root.
 Place a rubber band at the root and the end of each dread. Keep these rubber bands in place for a few months while the dreads mature. After 3 months, remove the rubber bands; the dreads should be tight and smooth, and will no longer need to be kept secure.
 Use clarifying shampoo and an essential oil spray to keep your dreads in healthy shape. If you plan to spend time outside or in an area where your dreads could get dirty, wear a hat to keep them clean.

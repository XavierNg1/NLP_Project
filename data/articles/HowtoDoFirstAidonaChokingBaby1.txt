 If the baby is coughing or gagging, this means that their airway is only partially blocked, so they are not being completely deprived of oxygen. If this is the case, allow the baby to continue coughing, as coughing is the most effective way to clear any obstructions.If your baby is making choking noises and they are old enough to understand you, try instructing them to cough or demonstrate how to do it before administering first aid.;
, If the baby is unable to cry or make noise, their airway is completely blocked and they will be unable to remove the obstruction by coughing. Other symptoms that indicate choking include:


Producing an odd, high-pitched sound or an inability to make any sound at all.
Clutching at the throat.
Skin turning bright red or blue.
Lips and fingernails turning blue.
Unconsciousness.
 Whatever you do, do not attempt to remove the obstruction yourself by sticking your hand down the baby's throat. This may cause the object the become lodged more deeply, or damage the baby's throat., Once you have ascertained that the baby is choking, your next step is to perform emergency first aid. If the baby is deprived of oxygen for too long they will lose consciousness and may suffer brain damage or even death. In such an emergency situation, it is important to have trained healthcare professionals on the scene as quickly as possible:If possible, have another person call local emergency services immediately, while you administer first aid. For your local number, check How to Call Emergency Services.If you are alone with the baby, start administering first aid immediately. Do this for two minutes, then stop and call emergency services. Resume care until the health care professionals arrive.Note that if the baby suffers from any heart conditions or you suspect that they are experiencing an allergic reaction (where the throat closes up), you should call emergency services immediately, even if you are alone.

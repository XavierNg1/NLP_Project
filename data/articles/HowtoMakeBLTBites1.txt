 For the BLT bites, you’ll need 1 baguette that’s been sliced into 2- to 3-inch (5- to 7.5-cm) wide rounds. To begin making the sandwiches, spread ½ cup (116 g) of mayonnaise on half of the rounds.If you like, you can toast the baguette before assembling the sandwiches. They may be a little more difficult to eat, though.;
, After you’ve spread the mayo on half of the rounds, you’ll need to layer 2 to 3 romaine leaves that have been torn into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces on the sandwiches. Place a single piece over the mayo on half of the sandwiches.If there’s another type of lettuce that you prefer, you can substitute it for the romaine.
 Once the romaine is in place on the sandwiches, place a piece of tomato over the lettuce. You’ll need 4 small tomatoes that have been sliced to fill all of the sandwiches.Grape or cherry tomatoes work well for the BLT bites.
 On top of the lettuce and tomato, place the bacon layer. Use 4 slices of cooked bacon that’s been chopped into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces to fill the sandwiches. Next, sprinkle a small amount of 2 chopped green onions over each of the sandwiches.You can omit the green onions if you prefer.
 To finish off the sandwiches, season them by adding a small amount of sea salt to each. Next, place the remaining baguette rounds on top of the sandwiches to close them.If you prefer, you can leave the sandwiches open and use the remaining baguette rounds to make additional sandwiches.
You can also add another layer of mayo, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and green onions on top of the second baguette round if you like.

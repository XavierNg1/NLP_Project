 There are different types of prisms that manipulate light in different ways. You will need to get a refractive prism. This type of prism will allow the light to bend in a way that splits it based on its wavelength. In other words, shorter wavelengths bend more, and longer wavelengths bend less. This creates a rainbow as the light exits the prism.You can buy a prism at a science supply store, a hobby store, or online. Basic prisms are relatively inexpensive.;
, The prism operates by splitting a beam of white light into its component colors. To see this, you will need a high intensity light source. Putting the prism by a sunny window or outside on a sunny day will be best., Make sure that there is nothing blocking the light from reaching the prism. As the light passes through, it will bend and be split into a rainbow. It might be easier to see if you aim the prism at a white wall or a white piece of paper.

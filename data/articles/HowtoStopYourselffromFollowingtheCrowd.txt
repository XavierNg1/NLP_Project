 Are your friends/acquaintances trying to get you into trouble, or are they wanting others to do what they think is right? Sometimes, in certain situations (such as you seeing your friends smoking and you wonder: "Should I smoke?") the best thing you can possibly do is ignore them and pick your own path.

Think! Are you doing something that will make you vulnerable, or is it a positive activity that can have a beneficial impact? If you think it is right, feel free to carry on. But if you don't, it's time to let it go, and think to yourself that what you do is your business.;
, For example, if all your friends do illegal activities, try to avoid them, or else you may get involved too. You don't have to walk up to them and say: "Hey, I don't like what you are doing!", you just have to try to walk away from the situation or try to tell them what they are doing is wrong. If your friend is confused or hurt as to why you seem to avoid them, it's time to tell the truth., Explain to them that you are having difficulties deciding whether to pick your own path or follow what others do. Remember that there are always others around to help you in ups and downs, and when you tell somebody about your problems and concerns, they are likely to help you and get the problem solved!, Millions of positive happenings will occur if you decide to live life your own way. If you're not sure what that is yet, there is no time like the present to begin that journey for yourself, while being considerate of others around you.

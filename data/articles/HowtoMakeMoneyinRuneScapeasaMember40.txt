 You are going to want at least 80+ stats in whatever combat you are using the the most effective defensive gear you can get. Have a few prayer potions, rocktails, and overloads if you can make them.
 If you have not completed Love Song, and don't have access to this teleport, use the Trollheim teleport. If you don't have access to this either, use the Burthrope home teleport and climb the mountain.
 This is done by killing the followers of each god. These are automatically aggressive unless you are wearing a piece of equipment specific to that god. You need to kill 40 minions of the desired boss to continue, along with 70 agility, constitution, strength, an attack for Armadyl, Zamorak, Bandos, and Saradomin respectively.
 The most profitable is Armadyl, with the Armadyl hilt and crossbow being very expensive, but also very hard. Bandos is the easiest boss, and gives you the least valuable drops. Pick whatever suits you best.

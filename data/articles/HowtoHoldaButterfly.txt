 If they're already feeding on flowers (such as a butterfly bush) or at a butterfly bar, this is an ideal place to be.
 Wear bright colors.Butterflies are attracted to bright colors because they look like flowers, which is where they get their food from.


See How to attract butterflies for more details.
 Put just a little on a small spot on your hand; any more and the butterfly might get stuck.


To make butterfly nectar, boil a solution of 4 parts water and 1 part sugar.
 When it lands, simply observe it and let it rest there or feed upon the sugar water., When the butterfly lands, slowly approach and put a container on top of it. Take the lid of the container and slide it under to trap the butterfly in the container.
 Wait for the butterfly to move onto it, then slowly take the leaf out, gently holding the tip of the butterfly's wings so that it cannot fly away. Be very careful when holding the wing. One slip up, and the butterfly's wing will be crumpled or torn.
 Once there, you can let go of the wings.

When you trap the butterfly with your hand, make sure the upper side (top of wings) are facing the edge of the net so that when you hold it, it isn't the wrong way up.
If the butterfly can flap its wings, you are not holding it hard enough and/or high enough.

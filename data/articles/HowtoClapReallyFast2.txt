 Place both of your hands against each other just like normal clapping. Then twist your hands in opposite directions (rotating one hand toward you and one hand away from you) to whichever position is most comfortable for you.


Your hands should be able to "hold" each other now.
 Quickly move your top hand up and down, hitting against your bottom hand. Your fingers can slightly curve to cup the other hand, and produce a pocket of air when your hands are apart. This will make your clapping contact louder.
 Clapping like this might get tiring, but if you keep your shoulder and elbow a bit stiff, your hands can be stabilized and increase the speed of your clapping.


Keep practicing until you get the hang of it.

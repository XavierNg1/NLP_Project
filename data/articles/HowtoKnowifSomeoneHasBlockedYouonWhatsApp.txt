, On Android, it is in white text in the upper-right of the screen. On iOS, "Contacts" is a gray icon at the bottom center of your screen.
, If no status, such as "online" or "available," appears below the contact's name, they may have blocked you.



On iOS, tap "Send Message" near the bottom of the screen that pops up in order to get to the chat window.
 This will appear at the top of the chat window, in gray text, beneath the user's name. If no "last seen" time is visible, this is further evidence that you may have been blocked.
 When you send a message to the contact, a single, blue checkmark will appear to the right of the timestamp in each chat bubble, meaning the message has been sent to the server. A second checkmark will appear once the recipient has read the message. If the most recent messages to the user you think has blocked you only display one checkmark, and never two, you may have been blocked.


The checkmarks alone are not a clear indicator. It could also mean that their internet connection is lost. However, if the second checkmark hasn't appeared after a long period of time, and other signs are there, you're likely blocked.
 This is the user's name at the top of the chat window.
 When you are blocked on WhatsApp, a user's profile will never change to you. If you have reason to believe that the suspected user has made changes to their profile, such as a new picture, but you can't see the changes, you may have been blocked.
 If you have identified more than one of these indicators, there is a chance that the suspected user blocked you on WhatsApp.

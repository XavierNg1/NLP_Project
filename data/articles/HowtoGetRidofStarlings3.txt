 While ultrasonic sound systems are available for purchase, their efficacy has been debated. Instead, old fashioned (preferably outdoor/waterproof) speakers seem to work best.


A variety of sudden sounds such as alarms, distressed bird recordings, and explosions are most effective.Play the sounds erratically, not in a predictable pattern.
Move the speakers’ direction, or adjust the fading and panning from the receiver system, to vary the directionality of the sound.
The sound of a gunshot may also frighten the starlings away., Using a variety of visual scare tactics is most effective. Some things to try are balloons, balloons with predator eyes painted on them, flashing lights, shiny/reflective items that move, and models of predators such as owls, hawks, and foxes.Be sure to move the visual scare devices frequently so that the birds do not become acclimated to them.
 Sporadically spraying the birds with water is a humane way to frighten the birds away.Like the audio and visual attacks, water sprays should be sudden and not patterned so that the birds do not adapt to the timing of the water.
 The best scare attack is one that combines multiple methods of making the birds’ roosting habitat undesirable. The more undesirable or inconvenient a habitat is, the more likely the starlings are to move on to a safer place.
 The bulk of your scare tactics should be applied when the birds are preparing to roost in the evenings. You can also launch a “reminder” attack in the morning as they are leaving their roosting areas.

 Sheds are made to be sturdy on the ground, not while being lifted, pushed, or pulled. Taking time beforehand to support weak points will save you a lot of trouble during and after the move.Remove any windows. Any shifting or warping of the structure could break them.
Help the shed keep its shape by attaching boards with nails or screws into the studs from corner to corner on each wall, and in an X pattern across the floor. Add additional diagonal supports across window and door openings, as these are weak points during a move.;
, Either dig four access holes at each corner, or (for smaller sheds only) two access holes in the middle of opposite sides. Dig only as much as is needed to place your chosen jack securely under the shed frame.You may be able skip the digging and tip and lift a smaller shed to fit the jack underneath, especially if it is sitting on a concrete or brick pad. If so, make sure you support the structural integrity first and tip and lift with extreme caution.
 In the best-case scenario, you’ll have multiple jacks so that you can lift the entire structure all at once. More realistically, though, you’ll probably have to jack up one side, prop it up securely with blocks or lumber, then relocate the jack and continue the lift. An automobile jack is a good choice for this job.If you’re going to move the shed by dragging it on a makeshift wooden sled, you won’t have to jack it up very high. If you’re rolling it on pipes, you’ll need to lift it a bit higher, and if you’re putting it on a trailer hitched to a truck, even higher still.
Jack up the shed only as high as necessary. The higher it is raised, the more careful you need to be. Make sure all jacks and supports are level, secure, and supporting the structure.
You can also make repairs to damaged or rotted areas at the bottom of the shed while it’s securely lifted off the ground.

To make it easier to cut the sweet potatoes, trim the ends and immediately cut the sweet potatoes in half. This way, they will sit level on the cutting board.
 Divide the seasoned sweet potato fries between the two baking sheets. Spread them evenly so they're in a single layer. Bake the sweet potato fries for about 15 minutes. Use a spatula to flip them over and bake them for another 10 minutes.
 Place the sweet potato sticks in a large mixing bowl and drizzle them with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Combine a spice mixture and toss this onto the sweet potatoes. You'll need:








1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
Â½ teaspoon black pepper

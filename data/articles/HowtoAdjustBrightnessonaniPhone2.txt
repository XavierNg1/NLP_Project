 This is the grey icon with cogs on one of the home screens.


This may also appear in the “Utilities” folder on the home screen.
 This will be in the third set of options.
 Moving right, towards the larger “sun” makes the screen brighter; left, towards the smaller “sun” makes the screen darker.
 This will automatically set a brightness setting for your current lighting conditions.


Auto Brightness uses a sensor in your phone to detect the light around you. This will make the screen brighter in direct light (backlighting) and dimmer in the dark (to prevent eye strain).Consider using the Night Shift option to schedule an automatic adjust of the color temperature for day/night cycle usage. This does not affect the screens brightness, but adjusts the color tone to the time of day.

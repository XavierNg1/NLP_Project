 Fill a small saucepan with ¼ cup, plus 2 tablespoons (90 milliliters) of water, and add 2½ tablespoons (32.5 grams) of brown sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often to help the sugar dissolve.
 Add ⅛ to ¼ teaspoon of lemon zest first, then set the two plums into the sugar-water. You do not need to peel or pit the plums first, but it would be a good idea to wash them, if you have not done so already.
 Reduce the heat low, then place a lid onto the saucepan. Let the plums simmer for 10 minutes., During this time, the plums will finish cooking, and the sauce will start to thicken., Once the plums have finished cooking, take the saucepan off the stove, and let the plums cool for about 5 minutes. Then, scoop the plums out with a slotted spoon, and serve them.


Poached plums taste great with ice cream!
You can drizzle the sauce over the plums, or you can save it for another dessert.

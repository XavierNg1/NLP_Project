 Look for stalks that are firm and bright green, and avoid stalks that are limp or woody. Asparagus is at its best in early spring.


Avoid asparagus with discolored parts or bruises.
Frozen asparagus can also be steamed, but the texture won't be quite like steamed fresh asparagus.;
, Asparagus usually comes in bundles of 14 to 18 spears. If you are cooking for multiple people, plan on having 3 to 5 spears per serving.Fresh asparagus will keep in the fridge for 3 to 4 days.If a recipe calls for 1 pound (450 grams) of asparagus, you will need 12 to 15 large spears, or 16 to 20 small spears., Run the asparagus under cool water and use your fingers to remove any dirt or debris. Focus on the tips, where dirt is most likely to be caught.
 Start peeling the asparagus about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) from the bottom.This is not necessary on thin stalks, but thick, woody stalks might need to be peeled. Not doing this may result in tough, fibrous asparagus.
 Hold the asparagus at each end and bend it. It will snap right where the woody part begins. This is usually around the bottom third. Discard the hard, woody, bottom part., This may help reduce the cooking time. It will also make it easier to eat.

,, Upon clicking the "Create An Animal" button, you'll find yourself on a page with an icon of the world spinning around.
 There will be a variety of animals for you to choose from (wolf, koala, seal, tiger, bunny, panda, monkey, and penguin). Click on an animal and an enlarged version will appear on the right hand side.


All animals in the list have access to both land and water.
There are other animals to choose from in the game, but these require a payment of 1000 gems.

Gems are Animal Jam's currency.

 Make sure that you like the animal you have chosen before continuing.
 There are three sections to your animal's name. Click the up and down arrows to scroll through the list of available names, and choose the ones to your liking. Note that you cannot change your animal's name after confirming that you want it, unless if you delete the animal and choose its name again. Click the "Next button" to continue on.


If you change your mind about the animal that you want, you can always click the "Back" button to go back to the animal choices.

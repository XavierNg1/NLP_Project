 There isn’t any way to avoid the conversation being a little bit uncomfortable. What is most important is that you have the conversation with your loved one. Keep in mind that your loved one is affected more substantially by being the person who was laid off, and thus is more sensitive to the topic. Even if it is your spouse that was laid off and the financial burden now falls on you, keep in mind that your spouse already knows that. They also took a hard hit to their self-esteem by being laid off.;
, Since your loved one is the one most affected by the layoff, it will often be harder for them to face the situation. Initiate the conversation by asking them a question or offering your help and support. This gives your loved one the opening they need to discuss the layoff.You might say something to your loved one like “I’m sorry to hear about the layoff. If you need anything at all, please let me know. I would like to help you.”
Consider writing a note. This will allow your loved one to write or call you back on their own time, so don’t expect an immediate response., The goal of talking to your loved one about their layoff is to understand their situation and to find out how you can help. Ask what kind of support would be most helpful to your loved one. Be sure that you are being sensitive about what you ask and how you word it.Do not assume that your loved one wants help finding a job. You may be wrong, and this mistake can often be offensive.
Instead of asking about work with things like “Do you have a backup plan?” you can ask things like, “Is there anything I can do to help?”

, You should give your loved one space to think about what they need and how they want to discuss the layoff. Avoid calling or texting your loved one about the layoff if they aren’t responding or if they seem to avoid the topic. They will need time to process the changes in their life and make a plan before being comfortable enough to share the details.If your loved one is reaching out or responding heavily to your efforts, you should continue to discuss the layoff and offer them support.

 Daisy mums are considerably sturdier than actual daisies, and they tend to last longer than daisies when kept out of water. If you want something a little more traditional, however, you can still use real daisies.
 Use scissors or a sharp knife. Anything longer will make the necklace look sparse of blooms, but anything shorter may not be sturdy enough to hold together.
 Use scissors or a knife to cut a 1 in. (2.5 cm) slit toward the bottom of each stem, but not through the bottom. The slit needs to be closed on both ends, rather than hanging open.
 Slide the stem all the way through the slit until the base of the bloom sits at the entrance of the slit.
 At this point, there should be three flowers, and two slits should have stems poking through them.
 Keep going until you have enough flowers to make a chain that can fit over your child's head.
 The first flower is the flower at the start of the chain. Slip the stem of the last flower through this second slit to close the loop.
 Wrap and tie a small piece of twine around each stem, where the flowers connect, to make the chain more secure.

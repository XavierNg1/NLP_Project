 You are in no danger on this night.
 Simply follow HandUnit's instructions and you'll move on quickly to the second night., When they begin opening the metal sheet, click and hold to keep it in place; dragging will be less effective. You'll need to do this twice, then you are told to go through Ballora Gallery.
 Move quickly if you want, but always stop whenever you hear Ballora's music playing. The loudness of the music indicates her proximity. Failure to stop moving when Ballora's music grows too loud will result in a game over.
 After reaching the Breaker Room, you are told to restart systems on the breaker panel. Opening the monitor will cause Freddy to approach, and restarting a system will make him approach even faster. It is best to partially restart a system, close the panel, play audio, and finish restarting a system. Upon restarting all systems, there is no more danger, and you may finish the night in peace.
 There, you will be provided with a flash beacon to help you. You will need to walk intermittently, and flash the beacon to avoid being attacked. Listen for footsteps going to either side, and walk the opposite way. Flashing the beacon too much or too little will result in a game over.
 It will guide you in how to remove Funtime Freddy's power module. You are in no danger here., After doing this, you are instructed to remove Bon-Bon's power module via clicking his black button. He will gradually rise up from either of Freddy's shoulders, and disappear when looked at.


It is best to keep Bon-Bon in the edge of the light beam as he rises up, then quickly move and click his button. Taking too long will result in his jumpscare. After doing this, there is no more danger, and you may complete the night.
 You no longer need to walk carefully, as Funtime Foxy will unavoidably jumpscare you and send you directly to Night 4., You will listen to Baby talk for a bit, and watch Ballora getting scooped. The real challenge of the night starts when Baby opens the faceplates on the suit.
 Once it does, set a three-minute timer to judge your proximity to the end of the night. The springlocks will then begin unwinding, and the Minireenas will start climbing up the suit.

Click and hold to wind springlocks, and shake left and right to get the Minireenas off the suit. Letting a springlock unwind fully or letting a Minireena climb too far will result in a Minireena's jumpscare and a game over.
 Keep this up as best as possible for the rest of the night. Once Minireenas begin climbing up the sides of the suit, try and wait until one is on each side before shaking them off, to maximize efficiency, as shaking will cause the springlocks to unwind faster. However, if only one Minireena is on the suit, and it's getting too far, shake anyway to avoid its jumpscare., Don't worry about these, as they won't kill you, but they will cause springlocks to unwind faster. After the three minutes is up, the night is over, and you may progress to Night 5., Night 5 is not very challenging, compared to earlier nights. When you are told by Baby to enter the random passcode, enter the numbers quickly and correctly; otherwise you will be jumpscared.  , Avoid flashing the beacon. You will then proceed to be "scooped" and the game will end., If you have completed the Baby "death minigame", you are now able to access the Private Room. When you reach Funtime Auditorium, completely ignore Baby's instructions and go forward and right until you reach the Private Room to face off against the hybrid animatronic, Ennard., You will have a short amount of time to get used to the game's mechanics, before the challenge starts. During this time, avoid using the monitor or the doors, as this will waste your extremely limited power supply., The real challenge begins once this sound is first heard. This will happen reasonably close to 1 AM. Listen carefully to where the sound is coming from. It will either be in the left, right, or center, signifying that he is on that side of the cameras., Close the corresponding door, and check the camera, on that side, closest to the room.

If Ennard isn't there, close the monitor and open the door.
If it is there, but not right up close, open the door and close it when you next hear movement, then double check to see that he's there.
If Ennard is right up close, or right at the door, keep it closed until you hear movement, therefore it has moved away.
 At one point around 4-5 AM, it is likely that audio cues can be heard rapidly, going from side to side. While this happens, Ennard is not immediately ready to attack, but he will likely end up right at the door when he stops moving., It is advised to use no more than 16-17% of power per hour. Unlike the first game, running out of power will result in an almost immediate death, as there is no stalling. If you find you've used more than the recommended power limit, it's best to restart the night.

 Putting a (temporary) barrier between the two of you bolsters his surprise and delight when you appear gorgeously dressed and smiling., It may be as simple as buying tickets to a movie he wants to see or a pint of his favorite ice cream. Little surprises along the way brighten his life and break up the usual routine.


Be sure to let him know there's a surprise in store. Drop a suggestive hint like, "Just wanted to make sure you're free tonight because you have a little something waiting for you.", Making up a little code that he probably won't be able to crack keeps you on his mind all day as he tries to figure out what "cot pets roll day" means. ("Let's play doctor!")Anagrams (scrambling the letters in a word or phrase) are great for this.
 It doesn't need to be anything eloquent; just leaning in and saying something for his ears only creates a sphere of intimacy and can help bring you out of routine conversations. It can be a simple "I love you," or a question you were going to ask him anyway, like, "Want to go for a walk with me?"


You can even do this when there's no one else around - even better!

 Peel the potatoes first, then cut them into 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) cubes; this will help them cook faster. Cover the potatoes with water; make sure they are completely submerged.
 Bring the water to a boil first, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the potatoes until they are soft and easily pierced with a fork.
 This will help dry the potatoes and keep them warm.
 Don't worry about getting them perfectly smooth just yet. You will be adding butter, milk, and sour cream later on, which will help make them smoother.
 Don't add in all of the milk just yet; you may not need it. The potatoes may appear too thin at first, but they will thicken up once they soak up the milk and butter.
 At this point you can add some more salt, pepper, or milk. You can also add in 1 tablespoon of fresh herbs, such as chopped chives, or 1 teaspoon of dried herbs, such as dill.
 They taste great on their own or with some extra butter. Cover and refrigerate any leftovers.

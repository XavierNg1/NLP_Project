 Also called muffler straps, muffler hangers are thick rubber loops. Your exhaust system may require more than 1 hanger, so look underneath the car to see if it requires any additional muffler hangers. Buy replacements for any that are broken or weakened.;
, Let the muffler rest on a floor jack while you get the hanger ready in the following steps.
 Some hangers might be constructed into 2 pieces, so make sure to remove all parts of the hanger.
 First hang it from the top exhaust mount, which is attached to the bottom of your car. Let the muffler hanger dangle temporarily.
 Pull up the muffler closer to the top exhaust mount so you can hook them together. Slide the handle through the muffler hanger, and hook the handle hole onto the exhaust mount located on the muffler. Slide the rubber muffler hanger along the wrench handle, and hook it over the muffler's exhaust mount.

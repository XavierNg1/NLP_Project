 Peel 2 bananas slice the bananas into small pieces. Lay the banana slices on a baking sheet or large plate and put the slices in the freezer. Measure out 1 cup (240 ml) of coffee and set it aside to cool. To speed up the process, you can refrigerate the coffee for about 30 minutes.Chill the bananas until they're completely frozen. This can take several hours. You could also do it the night before you want to make the smoothies.
 Pour the cooled coffee and frozen banana slices into the blender. Measure and pour 1 cup (240 ml) of unsweetened almond milk, 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder, and 2 tablespoons of almond butter into the blender. Grab a few handfuls of ice and add them to the blender.If you want a slushier banana mocha smoothie, use only one handful of ice.
 Put the lid on the blender and blitz the smoothies until the ingredients are combined. This should take around 1 minute. Remove the lid and pour the smoothies into two large glasses. Serve the smoothies immediately before they begin to separate.Consider garnishing the smoothies with extra slices of banana. You can use fresh or frozen banana slices.

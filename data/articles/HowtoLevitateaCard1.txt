 Take a normal, standard deck card. You will also need a small strip of plastic, about three fourths the length of the card. It should be thick enough that itâ€™s sturdy but still flexible. You don't need special plastic. You can use what you have around the house.Tape or hot glue the strip of plastic to the card, lengthwise. Your card is done being rigged. Tape the middle of it to the back of the card. This works best with a clear piece of plastic. If it is too hard to hold the piece of plastic with your palm, try a wider or longer piece. Perform the trick. Hold one end of the plastic on your thumb, with the other end on your middle finger. Then bring your fingers together, making the plastic go up in an arc. If you angle the card correctly towards the audience, it will appear as if the card is floating.;
, These cards come with a clear plastic strip attached to the card by the center. If you get one of those, levitation is simple.


Pinch the ends of the strip with two creases in your hand. Then, bend the strip, in a way that looks natural for your hand. For the best effect, you may want to utilize a substance that is clear and will look invisible to your audience.
Once you have done this, you can tape/glue the center of the strip to the center of your card. You have now created your own special levitating card.
 Levitating cards is all about the effect. A good angle can give an illusion to someone close that the card appears to levitate 1/2 an inch for a split moment. Practice in the mirror.When performing this trick with an audience, try to hold your hand lower so they cannot see the plastic underneath. It's best performed with good lighting, so the shadow can be seen.The real magic of levitation is playing the angles to make the spectator's mind see the card as levitating. This comes from rehearsing various levitation methods on friends and in the mirror in order to learn how to position your angles correctly.

 You want your candle to be small enough to float inside your jar. Your jar should also be large enough to hold some herbs and citrus slices.
 Fill your jar about ¼ of the way with some fresh herbs. Consider using some herbs that repel insects, such as: eucalyptus, lavender, lemon, peppermint, or pine.
 Take some lemons and/or limes, and cut them into thin, even slices. You want the slices to be ¼ to 1 inch thick. Cut enough citrus to loosely fill your mason jar.
 Pour some cool water into the jar. Leave an inch or two of the jar unfilled.
 Add about 10 drops of citronella essential oil into the water and stir to blend it.You can use more or less citronella essential oil depending on your preference.
 Gently place the candle on top of the water in your jar. If your accidentally gets wet, do not worry. Either wait until it dries out, or dab the water off with a tissue, que-tip or cotton ball.
 To use your citronella candle, simply set it on a stable surface and light the floating candle.


The citrus and herb water will keep for a few days, but eventually you will have to discard it. Consider placing a lid on the jar and storing it in the fridge when you are not using it to help keep it last longer.

 You will need a conversion program to change the BIN file to an ISO file. Once you change it to an ISO file, you will be able to mount or burn the file with many more programs.


One of the most popular free conversion programs is MagicISO.
 Start MagicISO and click the Tools menu. Select "BIN to ISO".
,, Click Convert to convert the BIN file to an ISO file. This may take a few minutes.
 Once the file has been converted, you can mount it using a virtual drive. If you are using Windows 8 or OS X, right-click on the ISO file and select "Mount".
 You can burn ISO files to discs using most burning programs. See this guide for more details.
 You can use programs like MagicISO to explore the contents of the ISO file, allowing you to copy specific files from within the archive.

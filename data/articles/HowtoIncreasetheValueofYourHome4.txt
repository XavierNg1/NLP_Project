 Start near the front door and add small plants around the edges of your house to make it open and inviting. This only costs a few hundred dollars, but an attractive lawn brings in more buyers and drives the value of your home up before anyone even steps through the front door.


Trim or replace overgrown shrubbery if it's already planted.
Use bright, colorful flowers like Hibiscus, Brown-Eyed Susans, Azaleas, or Zinnias., You want to make anyone walking into the house feel like royalty on the way in. Some simple ideas to make your walkway the red-carpet of house sales include:


Plant flowers along the walkway.
Install small lamps along the concrete. You can buy self-powered solar lights at most hardware stores that are made to be placed outside., If it is dilapidated, rusty, or falling down then people will assume the same about your house. You can easily buy and install your new mailbox by yourself and make it sparkle for a few dollars.


Stain the wooden post so that it does not rot.
Plant small flowers, like Marigolds, around the base of the mailbox.
 This can be difficult in some climates, but healthy grass is green, devoid of weeds and covers the entire lawn. Use "Weed & Feeds" which are specially formulated products that fertilize grass and kills weeds, to get rid of small patches of weeds and water your grass at least 1-2 a week.If your lawn has large bare patches, consider getting your lawn professionally seeded or installing sod (already grown grass) to make your lawn pop.
 Avoid going overboard, like adding a soccer field or an enormous, lush garden, which can signal to buyers that your house is “high-maintenance.” More important than a dazzling garden or water fountain is a clean, inviting lawn.


Cut your grass regularly so that it is trim and clean looking.
Pull up any weeds the flower beds.
Use a weed whacker to trim away tall grass next to the house, driveway, and walkways.

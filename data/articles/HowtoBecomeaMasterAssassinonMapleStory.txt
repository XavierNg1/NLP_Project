 They can deal quite high amounts of damage very early on, and are one of the best classes both early and late in levels.;
, Cygnus Knights are much faster to level (they gain 10% of their EXP bar each level up for free and get +6 ability points per level instead of +5), but they are limited to level 120. Normal Explorers, however, have a limit of level 200, and are a bit more flexible.
 For Explorers, this should get you near enough to level 10 (remember to talk to Olaf at Lith Harbour), at which point you can catch the cab to Kerning City and talk to the Dark Lord to become a thief (found inside the thieves' hideout, in the middle of the city). For Cygnus, stop as soon as you reach level 10 and make the job advancement with Eckhart.
 There are three types: Dexless, Low-dex and Regular dex. The more DEX you put in, the less money you will have to spend on equips, but the less powerful you will be. If you are starting fresh with no money, just go for regular dex. The rest of your AP goes into LUK.


Regular Dex just auto-assigns DEX until you reach your cap (most players choose to cap around 80-110)
Low-Dex thieves cap their dex much lower, around 40-60 usually. This is more of a balance between power and practicality.
Dexless thieves add no dex whatsoever to the starting 25 DEX. This means you need more money as you will have to buy special equips that don't require DEX. The trade-off is that you have much higher damage, as your damage is mostly influenced by LUK.
 Put one point into Lucky Seven to start training (you should ALWAYS use it for everything, never normal attack). Next you max Keen Eyes so that you can act like a proper ranged class, before pumping L7. Nimble Body is very helpful, and Dark Sight is huge later on but not that useful yet, so it comes last. The extra 3 points arbitrarily go into Double Stab, as they must all be spent before advancing. Night Walkers should replace Double Stab with Night.

,, They will give you a task so you can get your second job advancement. You are now an Assassin!

, Next you max Haste for its insane mobility - you will fly through maps. Put 5 points into Booster so it lasts for nearly a minute and it's not such a pain to activate. Then Mastery to stabilise your damage (mastery boosts your minimum damage, which increases your average damage and makes it swing less wildly), followed by Drain - you'll never need HP pots again! - and Booster winds up at 11. While Booster is good, it's only a minor pain to reactivate and none of the other skills can be sacrificed (including Shadow Resistance - 10% HP Boost plus Elemental resistance is really good)

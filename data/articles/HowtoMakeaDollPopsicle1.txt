 This might be a flat toothpick for a Barbie doll, or for bigger dolls, use a craft stick or skinny stick. Cut to the length you think will be realistic for your doll to be holding (be sure to account for the paper being added to the stick too).


If there are sharp edges after cutting the stick, file off using a nail file.;
, Choose a realistic color, one you'd find in real popsicles or ice lollies.
 Place the stick onto the end of the paper, firmly pressing it down onto the glue. Be sure to leave enough off the paper for the doll to hold as a handle.
 Keep rolling and rolling down the strip until the popsicle or ice lolly is the size you'd like it to be. Glue the last part of the strip and roll this into place to complete the popsicle. Allow to dry.
 This will remove any hole or opening from the top of the popsicle. It is important to remove any gaps, in preparation for sanding the popsicle.
, This will seal the paper and ensure that it won't unravel when played with. Let dry.
 The popsicle or ice lolly is now completed. Make as many as you wish.

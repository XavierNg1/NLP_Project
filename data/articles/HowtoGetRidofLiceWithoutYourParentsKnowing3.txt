Trimming your nails short can help remove the temptation. You can also take up a hobby, like knitting, that requires you to use your hands.
 If you do not want your parents to learn about your infestation, you have to be careful about when and where you apply at home treatment. Hide any special shampoos you're using. If you use household items, prepare an excuse if your parents notice them missing. For example, you could say you were rummaging in the cupboards for something and knocked over the bottle of olive oil.


Be aware that if your parents catch you lying to them, you may get into trouble for your dishonesty. It will likely be better to just admit that you have lice.
 Getting rid of lice involves a lot of laundry and vacuum cleaning. If you don't want your parents to know you have lice, you can volunteer to do such chores and claim you want extra allowance. This will prevent your parents from getting suspicious about why you're suddenly doing extra vacuuming and laundry.

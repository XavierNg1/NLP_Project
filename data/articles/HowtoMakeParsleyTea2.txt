 Fill a tea kettle or small saucepan with 1 cup (250 ml) of purified water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.
 Measure out 2 tsp (10 ml) of dried parsley leaves. Place the leaves in the bottom of a teacup, pour the boiling water on top, and steep the leaves for 5 to 10 minutes.


Parsley tea can have a bitter taste. Steep it for 5 minutes if you're sensitive to bitterness. If you enjoy strong teas or plan to sweeten it, steep the parsley for up to 10 minutes.
 Pass the contents of the teacup through a tea strainer. Collect the liquid tea in a second teacup placed beneath the strainer and discard the caught parsley leaves.
 Sweeten the tea, if desired it, or drink the parsley tea without any sweetener. Either way, you should enjoy it while it's still hot.


Use your favorite sweetener, or consider trying a bit of raw cane sugar or locally sourced honey.

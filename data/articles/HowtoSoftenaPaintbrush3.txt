 Before you start soaking your brushes, make sure you try to remove as much paint as you can. You can do this with a brush cleaning tool or with a plastic hair comb. Just make sure that you aren’t pulling too forcefully, as this can cause some of the bristles to loosen and fall from the brush.
 Any typical fabric softener will work. Pour a ½ cup of fabric softener for every gallon of water. For example, if you are using a 5-gallon bucket, then you would use two and a half cups of fabric softener. Of course, if you are only softening one or two brushes, you definitely won’t need 5-gallons worth.Fabric softener is better than dish soap because it lowers the surface tension between liquids and solids, which means it makes water “wetter.”

, Taking one brush at a time, swirl them in the fabric softener/water mixture. You want to put them into the solution up to the ferrule and then flick them back and forth quickly, counting to ten. The paint should dislodge from the bristles and fall to the bottom of the bucket.


Once the paint is clear, set the brushes aside to dry.

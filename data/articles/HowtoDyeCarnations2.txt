 Don't use a colored one, or the colors won't show up well. Also, avoid using an old, wilted carnation, or it won't soak up the water or dye.
 Use a sharp knife or a pair of scissors for this. For even better results, cut the stems while they are under the water. This will prevent air bubbles, which can lead to early wilting., Split the stems until you are about halfway up the stem. Place the cut carnation into a vase filled with plain water when you are done.If you are really careful, you can try to split the stem into three parts rather than two.
 You will need about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) of water for each glass.Make sure that the glasses have straight walls; avoid using anything that curves inward or outward.

You can also use test tubes instead. Tie them together with string or a rubber band first, then set them down into a cup., Be generous with the dye. Plan on using 20 to 30 drops for Â½ cup (120 milliliters) of water. Stir the water until the color is consistent., Place the jars close together so that they are touching. Make sure that the segments are well-submerged; add more water and dye, if needed., This may take as little as a few hours to as long as a whole day. Keep in mind that some colors show up much faster than others. For example, if you used pink, yellow, and blue, you might see the blue show up after a few hours, and the yellow show up after a day., Keep in mind that carnations dyed in this manner will rarely turn out a solid color; they will usually have white streaks in them.

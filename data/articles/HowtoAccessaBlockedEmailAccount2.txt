 To do this, open a web browser and visit the login page of your email account.
 On the login page, you’ll find a link labeled “Help.” Click this link and you’ll be redirected to the email provider’s help section.
 Most sites can be reached by filling out a request form from the help section describing your concern in detail and providing an alternate email address where they can reply back to you.


Once your request gets processed, you’ll be contacted by a representative to start handling your concern.
You can also call the customer service department if the number has been provided in the help section. This method is faster but is not advisable for people who are residing from another country or region.
 In most cases, they will just unblock your email account from their end, but you still need to do some stuff like creating a new password. Do what the representative tells you and you should be able to access your blocked email account again.

 Once you are in the game, you can view the upgrades you can do on your armor by pressing the middle mouse button (PC), the Back button (Xbox 360), or the Select button (PS3).


The Upgrades screen should appear, which you can navigate by using the arrow keys or the D-pad on console controllers.;
, The information at the sides of the screen will change according the the highlighted upgrade.
 There you will see what the upgrade does in the top, the maximum upgrade allowed, the conditions for unlocking the upgrade, and the Suit Statistics.
 The number of conditions required to unlock the upgrade is symbolized by the number in the middle of the padlock for each upgrade module. Read through the conditions of the module you wish to unlock.
 For instance, the Endurance module requires you to sprint and swim X number of meters. Once these conditions are met, the module will unlock, allowing you to gain the passive benefits of the module.
 You can assign up to three hotkeys, which you can press to activate a set combination of nanosuit upgrades. In the upgrade menu, you will see at the bottom-right corner that there is a grid, and buttons at the leftmost of the grid cells.
 Once you have unlocked some upgrades, you can assign them to a combination by pressing and holding the corresponding buttons on the left of the grid.


For PC: 1,2,3
For Xbox 360: Y,X,B
For PS3: Triangle, Square, Circle.
 Do so by pressing the ESC key, Back, or Select to exit to the game. Now, you can press the button you assigned your combination, and the upgrades will have activated right after you pressed that particular button.

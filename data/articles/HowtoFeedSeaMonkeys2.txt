 Optionally, you may use Super Food instead of Growth food, but only once every few feeding sessions.This is supposed to cause your sea monkeys to grow larger and more quickly.
 Gro-Kwickly is meant to be added with the small scoop no more than once per week, in addition to the ordinary food.This may result in more rapid growth, although the company that makes these products does not explain the difference between this and Super Food.
 This packet claims to contain vitamins that make your sea monkeys healthier or more energetic. The most noticeable effect, however, may be the pink or red color that the sea monkeys develop. You may need to feed them Red Magic for several feeding sessions before this becomes visible.
 The back of the Banana Treat packet claims that this food has extra nutrients, so it may not be as unhealthy as some human "treats."However, it appears that this product is only intended as an occasional treat to excite your sea monkeys, instead of regular food. If your sea monkeys are not excited by this food, there is probably no point in using it.
 The Sea Medic packet is not a replacement for food. If you see white balls floating in your tank, fight this bacterial infection by adding Sea Medic daily with the small end of the feeding spoon, until the balls are gone.

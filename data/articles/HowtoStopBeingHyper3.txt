 Many people think that hyperactivity is caused by the busy and stressful spaces.


If you can, include calming colors in your home or workspace. Paint walls serene blues, violets, and greens. Avoid harsh colors like reds, oranges, and yellows., If hyperactivity is partly the result of stress, there is no better way to reduce stress than through meditation. Take a moment to just sit in one place. Don't think about your problems or goals for the day. Just take a moment for yourself. Meditation has been proven to reduce blood pressure, which can reduce your hyperactivity., Sometimes hyperactivity can be the result of anxiety. Maybe you’ve been in the same room for too long. Going outside for just 20 minutes is enough to rejuvenate you., Hyperactivity is often the result of visual or auditory distractions. You may seem to be hyper, but it is just your brain jumping from stimuli to stimuli.


Visual stimulation can exacerbate hyperactivity and concentration as well. Try placing your body in positions that reduce visual stimuli. Organize your workspace in a way that reduces your line of sight. Face the wall.Use large dividers to block your sight, almost like a jockey uses blinders on a horse to keep them from becoming distracted during a race.
Sounds can be very distracting. Maybe coworkers chatting next to a water cooler catches your attention and then it is difficult to return to the task at hand. Find ways of reducing noise distractions like using noise canceling headphones. If you can control what produces the sound (i.e. like your cellphone, speakers, …etc.), turn them off ahead of time.
You may consider using relaxing sounds to replace more distracting ones. Play soft music, like classical in the background. Keep in mind that calming music might not be the kind of music you prefer normally. A lot of music is designed for movement like dancing. You want music that will encourage you to stay still, calm, and relaxed.

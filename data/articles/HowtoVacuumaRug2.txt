 Tufted rugs are held together by a layer of latex glue that secures the tufts and prevents them from falling out. If your rug is particularly old, this layer of glue will show signs of cracking and crumbling, meaning that the tufts are no longer secure. If you notice patches on the underside of your rug that are missing glue, be extra careful when cleaning that portion of the rug. Being too aggressive will lead to fibers falling out and the creation of bare patches., All tufted rugs have a pile, itâ€™s just the density of the vertical fibers protruding from the rug. They will also have a pile direction, which is the direction that the fibers naturally lay.To determine the pile direction, brush your hand along the rug. The rug will appear darker and you will feel resistance when you brush against the pile.









If your carpet is rectangular, the pile direction will be going lengthwise.
Regular traffic across a rug can change the pile direction in certain places. Rotate your rugs regularly so the pile stays uniform across the whole rug.
 If you vacuum with the pile direction, the fibers will cover and protect the dirt you are trying to remove. If you vacuum against the pile direction, this can provide unnecessary wear on the rug and accidentally remove tufts from it.








For best results, use a canister vacuum without a beater bar or a similar vacuum that only uses suction.

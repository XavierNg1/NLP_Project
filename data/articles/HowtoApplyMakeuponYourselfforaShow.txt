 Make sure you have a good well-lit mirror, cotton wool pads, make-up brushes, make-up sponges and make-up remover, just in case you make a mistake. While you're working, remember to sit back and judge the effects of your work at a distance from time to time: your audience won't be looking at you from two feet away.;
, Bear in mind that stage lighting tends to shine right through make-up and make the skin underneath visible despite your make-up application. You will probably have to use far more make-up than usual. If necessary for the role, contouring to change face shape should be done at this stage--highlighting cheekbones, increasing eye depth, narrowing or attaching little importance the nose, highlighting a weak chin, emphasizing less on a lantern jaw, adding age lines.

 Paint on lipstick using a lip brush. Blot to remove excess but leave the stain, then reapply the lipstick and blot lightly once more. This ensures thorough and longer-lasting coverage.

 Letting heavy theatrical make-up sit on your face for hours is bad for your skin. A good start for getting most of your make-up off is boxed baby wipes--handy and effective. But follow that with a make-up remover specifically for eyes and a thorough cleansing of the entire face. Finish with a toner/astringent and a moisturizer.

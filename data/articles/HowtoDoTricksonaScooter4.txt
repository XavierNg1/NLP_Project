 Skate parks are pretty all inclusive, and most welcome scooter riders as well as skateboarders or BMX riders. There are also some parks made specifically for scooter riders.Look for a park near you, then pick out some ramps to practice getting some air. Once in the air, you can use “flair moves”, or tricks that you do in the air while before landing.
 Ride up the ramp or the bowl, making sure you’ve got enough speed built up. Once you hit the coping, or the metal railing around the lip of the ramp, jump. Jump as you normally would, putting both feet on the deck and jumping straight up. You’ll be in the air, ready to try some tricks.
 Once you’re in the air, twist the handlebar so that your left handle is on the right side and the right handle is on the left side. Keep holding onto the handlebars, and your arms will create an “X”. Make sure to turn the handlebars back before you land., While in the air, let go of one handlebar and use your free hand to grab the opposite handlebar. Begin to spin the handlebars all the way around. Use your other hand to reach around and grab the handlebar you first let go of. Return the handlebars all the way around to their starting position., The tail grab is a trick borrowed from skateboarders, and it looks just as cool on a scooter. Once you’re in the air, bend slightly at the knees, then take one hand off the handlebars. Use that hand to grab the back of your deck. Hold on for as long as you can, then let go before landing.

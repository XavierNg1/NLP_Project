 The Neverflat ball won't lose as much air as a normal basketball, but it can still deflate a little in cold weather. If you stored it outside or in a cold garage and it feels flat, dribble it until it warms up., Spalding basketballs are covered by a limited warranty for one year after purchase.Pumping a Neverflat ball will break the warranty.If the ball went flat and there's no obvious sign of damage, tell Spalding about the defect to request a refund or replacement. There are two ways to do this:


Call 1–800–SPALDING (USA phone number) and ask for a return authorization.
Send the basketball and the sales slip to Spalding Consumer Relations / One Fruit of the Loom Drive / Bowling Green, KY 42103. Include your name, address, telephone number, and description of defect.
 If the warranty has expired or doesn't apply, you can pump a Neverflat basketball just like any other basketball. Despite the name, all Neverflat balls will need pumping occasionally, especially after the first year. If you're not sure how to inflate a basketball, keep reading.

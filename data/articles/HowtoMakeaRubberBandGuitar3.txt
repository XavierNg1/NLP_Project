 This guitar is simple and easy to make. It is ideal for young children. It can also double up as a banjo. Here's a list of what you will need:Two paper plates
Glue
Wooden ruler or paint stir stick
4 rubber bands
Paint, stickers, glitter, etc (to decorate)

, Draw a line of glue around the upper rim of a paper plate. Place the second plate right on top of it. The plates should be stacked, so that you end up with one thick plate.


Make sure that your paper plates are sturdy and have a ridge or rim.
 Cover the bottom third of the stick with glue. Press it against the back of the plate. The rest of the stick should be sticking out from behind the guitar; you don't want the neck to be too short or it will look silly. Try to center the stick as much as possible.
 You can paint the guitar using acrylic paint. You can also draw designs on it using markers or glitter glue. You can even make it look more colorful by covering it with stickers.


Consider clipping two wooden clothespins to the top of the stick. Space them about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) apart. If you don't want the clothespins to fall off and get lost, place glue on the stick before clipping them on.
 If you move ahead to the next step too soon, your guitar will fall apart. How long it dries depends on how much paint and glue you used.
 Place two rubber bands two the left side of the stick, and two rubber bands to the right side of the stick. Try using both thick and thin rubber bands to create different sounds.
 Experiment with producing different sounds. Don't pull on the strings too tightly, however, or they may break.

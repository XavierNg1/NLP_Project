 To create a soda can cover to use over a beer can, you will need to have a few things on hand. Here is what you will need:Can of beer (full)
Can of soda (empty)
Can opener
Scissors
Metal file;
, Use a can opener to evenly slice off the top of the soda can just under the lip. Be sure to move the can opener slowly around the whole top to prevent tearing to the can or inquiry to yourself., Again, you can use a can opener to take off the bottom portion where the can curves inward. This is where the beer can will fill the indented portion of the base., Use scissors to evenly cut just above the line that separates the silver portion at the bottom. This will ensure that you make a perfectly neat edge all the way around.
 Find a part of the can which has a line of writing or other line that you can neatly follow for cutting along the side. Cut along this line using scissors, from the base to the top of the can. This will open the can.

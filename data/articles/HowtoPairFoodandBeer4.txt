 Cutting intense heat, flavor, or richness of foods with an equally intense beer can allow strong flavors to mingle and even compete. If you’re not a fan of intense beer flavors and aromas, you can cut the flavor of food with a beer whose flavor profile is on the opposite end of the intensity spectrum., Try cutting the heat and flavors of a spicy dish like Thai green curry with the hoppy bitterness of an IPA. An IPA, with its notes of citrus and pine and rich malt, will cut through the heat of spicy foods, creating an unexpected match made in heaven., The malt sweetness of the beer will calm the burn, cutting through the food’s intensity. Try pairing Cajun foods like gumbo with German Doppelbock, a beer known for its malt sweetness., When the bold flavors of rich, fatty meats or cheeses are creatively cut with the bright sourness of a fruited lambic or beer, the results are surprising. Try pairing Lambic with duck or pork. A gueze will cut the oiliness of fish like salmon or mackerel., A bitter, dry stout will cut through the tender sweetness of shellfish like oysters. This classic pairing is quite pleasing to the palate.

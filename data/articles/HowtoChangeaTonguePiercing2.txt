 Follow the above procedure to clean your mouth and wash your hands before handling your piercing. It’s important to keep your hands and jewelry clean even after your piercing heals.
 Be careful not to harm your teeth! Clamp down on the back of the labret slowly. Keep this position to hold the stud in place.
 Stabilize the flat, bottom part of the labret with your thumb, beneath your tongue. Carefully hold your tongue piercing atop your tongue with your index and middle finger on either side of the bar. This will hold it steady and also ensure the bar does not slip out of the tongue in the process.
 Use your other hand to unscrew the ball to the left, or clockwise.
 Do so without letting it drop into your mouth or out of your hands.


If you are struggling, it is best to get professional help. Do not tug at your piercing; this risks damaging your tongue.
 Do this right away so your piercing doesn’t start to close up. Make sure the ball is screwed on tightly.Consult a professional piercing artist as soon as possible if you lose part of your piercing; they can re-pierce any closed holes.

 You may think this step is crazy, but it's true. If you're wearing a blue goalie pinnie, and your team's colour is blue, you won't be allowed to wear that pinnie in play. This is because the referee can't easily tell who can pick up the ball, and neither can the other team. This gives you an unfair advantage, which is why it is illegal. So pick a colour that's very different from your team's.;
, A goalie pinnie shouldn't be like another layer. It should just be a light garment. You can get a heavier one for the winter, and a lighter one for this summer, because this helps some people.
 Many pinnies have padding on the side of the arms, but many don't. If you dive a lot, you should get this handy padding. If you don't, it's not as recommended that you get it. But if you are planning on learning soon, you should get the padding.
 During winter, it is recommended that you get a fitting pinnie. During summer, you may want a slightly looser pinnie. You can also change the length of the pinnie if you'd prefer a longer shirt.
 Pinnies can be long sleeved or t-shirt style. You should choose according to the season and the weather. If you'd like, you could even get one of each; one for warm days, and one for cold days. This way, you'll never be caught off guard.

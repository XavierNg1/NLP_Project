, Repeat a couple of times.(see Tips)

, If you are happy with the size and height glue them down.
 Glue around the sides of the hill and apply the tissue paper and glue over the top (watered down PVA glue is best for this) you want to cover all the side so you can’t tell its corrugated cardboard underneath. To make it more realistic (well as realistic a cardboard hill can be) don’t do it all the same put bumps and clumps in random places.
, Paint the whole thing what colours you feel to make it as life like as possible normally I would do an undercoat of dark green and dry brush with a brown so it sticks to the tops of the sand and throw in some light greens for shading.
 You have a hill with a flat surface to put your archers/warmachines on to rain terror on the battlefield and it didn't cost you much, in fact if your lucky you can do it with stuff laying around the house/outbuildings so a nice hill that costs nothing.

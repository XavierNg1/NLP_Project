 There is more than 1 way to do this, depending how you want the iTunes subscribe link to look. Choose one of the following ways:


Add an iTunes subscription link to your text widget, using the general formula of HTML code, URL, text and closing HTML code. For example, place the usual hyperlink HTML code, which is a less than sign (<), then "a href= " at the beginning, and then your link, "> "Subscribe http://www.itunes.com/podcast?id=YOUR-FEED-ID-NUMBER-HERE>"Subscribe in iTunes, and then close your html code with a less than sign (<) "/a" and then a greater than sign (>). You will need to include the quotes at the beginning and end of your URL, but not around any of your beginning or ending HTML code. Save the link and it will appear on your blog.

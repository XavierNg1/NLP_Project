 You need to do your research before you enroll; otherwise, you could end up at a school that isn't well-suited for you. Is this school successful overall? What do people in your area think of it? Is it even available in your state? Figure out what school you think is best for you before you go.;
, Once you've found the school that you think will be best for you, start enrolling. This is often a long process, involving the parent and the student. While the entire procedure starts online, you'll also need to fax in certain things to the school, depending on your state and which school it is. It may take a short while to get everything sent in as needed, but in 1-3 weeks, you should be signed up.


If this process is taking over a month, you probably need to switch to a different school. This is abnormally long, and you'll just end up getting yourself annoyed as it takes longer and longer.
 Once you've successfully enrolled, there may be a few other things you'll need to do, such as getting your supplies (if you need any), sending in some more information, and completing various tutorials.
 Online school is very time-consuming, and if you're constantly taking up space on your house's computer, it can make things tough for others. Get a laptop so that you can do your school without taking up others' space.
 One of the toughest parts of moving from brick-and-mortar school to online school is making friends in an unfamiliar way. So do whatever you can to connect with your classmates! Social activities vary from school to school, but you're guaranteed to make some friends as long as you make an effort to connect.
 Because the school is public, you'll be required by law to take it, so be prepared!

, Just like teachers in a brick-and-mortar school, your online instructors are there to help you. Keep in touch over the phone or through your school's messaging system so you can get better in school.

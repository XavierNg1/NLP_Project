 Although it’s correct trail etiquette for cyclists and foot traffic to yield to horses, novice hikers and bikers may lack the experience to know this.Make sure to engage verbally with other trail users. This way, you will know if they plan to pass you or are going to step off the trail.
 Once you’re in communication with another trail user, if they have not already yielded the trail, politely ask for the right of way. Novice hikers and cyclists may not understand that they need to accommodate your horse and step off the trail. Say something like,


“Hi. my horse might get spooked by seeing a bicycle on the trail. Could you stand off the trail?”
“Would you mind stepping to the side while my horse and I pass?”

, It’s your responsibility to keep your animal under control. Horses are much larger than both hikers and bicycles, and if out of control, can seriously hurt people—including yourself.


If you are riding a young horse or one that is poorly trained, you may need to yield the trail.
 This will reassure your horse. The animal will feel more comfortable when hearing two human voices converse.By talking, you can also learn important information from other trail users. Say something like,
“You may want to stay off the trail for a few minutes. Several other horses are passing this way.”
“How many other hikers/cyclists can I expect to see behind you?”

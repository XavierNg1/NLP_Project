 Selling things you don't need is probably one of the most effective ways to earn bells. A few ways to do so...



Fish, catch bugs, shoot presents, or get digging.
Use tools. Using tools that can be purchased from Tom Nook's store located in your town, catch, shoot or dig up some treasures that Nook loves.
Check with Blathers. Before you run off to the stores, check if Blathers has your bug, fish or fossil in the museum. If so, donate it. If not, feel free to sell it!
Get a 'Loid'.If you go digging, and dig up one of those "Loids", sell it if you don't want it. They can be sold for around 880 bells each.
Check for presents. If you are shooting down things from the sky, check what present you got - if it's not going towards your house project because it's something you don't need, sell it for its price according to Tom Nook. Doing this is not only fun and enjoyable, but your work definitely gets rewarded.
Go through your drawers and cupboards because who knows what things you have tucked away in them. There may be things in there that you don't want or need anymore. If so, go ahead and sell them. Old flooring and wallpapers in your pockets might already have a copy in your drawers - if so, sell the spare. If you happen to sell anything that you may regret later on, you can always buy it back from the catalog if you're desperate.
Sell at a flea market. Flea Markets are always handy. Sell any of your old furniture that you are trying to get rid of to neighbors on the First Saturday of Every Month. The good thing is, YOU choose the price, as long as it's in the buyer's budget range. So, this means you may be able to sell it for more than Nook would pay you anyway.

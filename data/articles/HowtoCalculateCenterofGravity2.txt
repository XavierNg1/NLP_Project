 When you're calculating the center of gravity, the first thing you should do is to find the weight of the object. Let's say that you're calculating the weight of a see-saw that has a weight of 30 lbs. Since it's a symmetrical object, its center of gravity will be exactly in its center if it's empty. But if the see-saw has people of different weights sitting on it, then the problem is a bit more complicated., To find the center of gravity of the see-saw with two children on it, you'll need to individually find the weight of the children on it. The first child has a weight of 40 lbs. and the second child's is 60 lbs.

 Meanwhile, place one of the interior racks into the center position of the oven.Note that you do not need to prepare a baking sheet for the corn. For this method, you'll need to place the ears of corn directly onto the oven rack. Do not cover the oven rack in aluminum foil, either.;
, Quickly clean the outer husks by rinsing them beneath cool, running water. Use your fingers to scrub away any visible dirt or debris.


Do not remove the husks from the ears of corn.
If there are any silks hanging out of the ends or leaves peeling away from the sides, use clean kitchen scissors to trim them away.
 Arrange the ears of corn in a single layer directly on the center rack. Cook the corn until it becomes tender.If there's another oven rack above the center rack, you can let it remain in place as long as it does not come into contact with the corn. If it does, you should remove it completely or move it to a position beneath the center rack.
Try to keep the corn in a single layer. If you need to stack it, you may need to increase the overall cooking time. You'll also need to make sure that the pile of corn does not touch the upper heating element of the oven.
To check for doneness, gently squeeze the sides of the ear. It should be firm, yet soft enough to press through the husk.
 Remove the finished corn from the oven and let it cool for several minutes. When the husks are cool enough to touch, carefully peel them down from each ear.


Consider holding the base of each ear with an oven mitt before peeling down the husks. Also note that the steam escaping from the corn will be very hot, so you should never point the ears directly at your face.
You can wrap the husks around the base of each ear to serve as a handle or remove them completely. The choice is yours to make.
 Brush the corn on the cob with melted butter or olive oil, if desired, and consider seasoning it with salt, pepper, and chopped parsley to taste. Serve the finished corn on the cob while it's still hot.

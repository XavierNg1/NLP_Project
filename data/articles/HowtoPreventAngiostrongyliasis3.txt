 Symptoms of Angiostrongyliasis are generally mild. They include a slight fever or gastrointestinal discomfort. You might also experience a strange tingling or pain across the surface of your skin.


If the parasite migrated into your eye, you might have blurred vision or eye pain in addition to the other symptoms.
In certain extreme cases, you might experience seizures.Symptoms might appear within 24 hours or as much as one month after initial infection.If you are experiencing a stiff neck, headaches, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, and fatigue, you may have meningitis due to angiostrongyliasis. This is extremely serious. Seek immediate, emergency medical care.
 Even if you manifest the relevant symptoms, you might not necessarily have angiostrongyliasis, and the disease is hard to diagnose. Only a trained medical doctor can confirm if you are or are not infected with the parasite. If you have meningitis, you might need a spinal tap, a procedure in which spinal fluid is drawn. The doctor will then examine your white blood cells for evidence of parasites.
 While the parasitic larvae will die on their own given enough time (usually two to eight weeks), there are courses of treatment that will ease your symptoms until the parasites die off. After consulting with your doctor, he or she might prescribe painkillers or corticosteroids (to prevent inflammation). The specific course of treatment youâ€™ll need will be determined by your doctor.


Turn down suggestions to take anti-helminthic (anti-parastic) drugs. These have not been proven effective in treating angiostrongyliasis and might actually exacerbate your condition.In some extreme cases, a length of inflamed intestine might need to be removed.

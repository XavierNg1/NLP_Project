 Plan to hang most of your pictures at roughly eye level for a pleasing effect. The center of your picture should usually end up between 57 and 60 inches from the ground. Measure it out with a tape measure and lightly mark the proper height with a pencil.


Feel free to adjust the center height of your pictures based on your own height or the height of the room you are decorating. These numbers are only a guideline.
 Hold your picture up so that its center point is directly over the spot you marked with a pencil and ensure you like how it looks there. If you feel that it should be raised or lowered, do so. Once you have made a final decision, measure from the center of the picture to the top edge of the frame and note the height. Next, measure down from the top of the frame to the hanging bracket or wire on the back of the frame. Subtract this small measurement from the frame height measurement to determine where on the wall you should insert your anchor so that the center of the picture will be at the desired height.


If your picture has a wire hanger, pull the wire up towards the top of the frame until it is taut before measuring, since this is where the wire will be once it is hung on the anchor.

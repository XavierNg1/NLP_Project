 As you begin playing ping pong, record when each player scores a point. Essentially, you score a point by keeping the ball in play longer than your opponent.


If your opponent fails to hit a ping pong ball that you served or hit last, you get one point for the game.Remember, in ping pong you have to hit your ball so it bounces off your end of the table, and then off your opponent's end of the table. If your opponent misses the ball, but the ball does not bounce on his or her side of the table, you do not get a point., You can also lose points in ping pong. Make sure to record when you lose a point. Under the following conditions, you would subtract one point from your total score.If you miss the ball, you'll lose a point.
If you hit the ball into the net and it falls back onto your side of the table, you'll lose a point.
If you hit the ball too hard, and it falls off the table, you lose a point.
You cannot hit the ball before it bounces off of your side of the table. If you do so, you'll lose a point.
If your ball bounces twice on your side of the table, you'll lose a point.
If you accidentally move the table during play, you'll lose a point.
 Each time you or your opponent misses the ball, you will have to serve the ball again. In ping pong, service changes every two points.For example, you serve the ball to begin a game. You score one point, after your opponent fails to hit the ball. It would be your responsibility to serve again. Then, your opponent scores a point on you. Once again, you serve the ball. You have reached two total points in the game, one for you and one for your opponent.
The next time a point is scored, it's your opponent's turn to serve. He or she will keep serving until another two points are scored. Then, it's your turn again.

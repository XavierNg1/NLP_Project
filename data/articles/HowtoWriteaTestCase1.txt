 Before writing a new test case for your module, find out whether there are already existing test cases that test the same component. This can be a real time saver!


If you do find existing test cases, consider updating test case, rather than writing a new one.;
, Being aware of what constitutes a good test case will help you write a better and stronger test case.These characteristics include:


Accuracy: The test clearly articulates the purpose.
Tracing: The test is capable of being traced to requirements.
Repetition: The test can be used to do the test as many times as necessary.
Re-usability: The test be reused if necessary.
Independence: Every test case you write should be able to be performed in any order, without any dependency on other test cases.
Concision: The description of a test case should be simple and clear and have no extraneous steps or words. A tester should be able to understand it by reading it one-time over. The description should use action words, like "do 'x'" and "do 'y'."

, Concentrate on what could happen with the product when being used by a customer. Think about this carefully and design your test(s) accordingly.Scenarios should be concise. The goal of a test scenario is not to provide a lot of specific details, but to instead convey a specific idea about testing a particular case.
 Because scenarios and cases form the base for future test cases and testing, you need to give yourself enough time to write a quality test as well as time to have the procedure thoroughly reviewed.

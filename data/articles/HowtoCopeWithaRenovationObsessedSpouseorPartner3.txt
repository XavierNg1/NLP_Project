 Renovations can become all consuming. Make sure you set aside time for other activities. Renovations should not take up all of your free time and they should not be the sole topic of conversation between you and your partner.


Come up with a word to say when the talk of renovations has become unbearable for you. Rather than telling your partner you canâ€™t take it anymore you can just use a special word that signals you want to change the subject.
 Buy a calendar and clearly mark down times or days of the week to be spent on renovations and other days where you will not complete any renovations.


It is important that once you create a schedule you stick to it. Remember that these renovations are important to your spouse. If you have agreed to spend time working on the renovation you need to follow through with this.
 If your spouse has multiple renovation projects on the go or often completes back-to-back renovations you may want to set aside a specific amount of time between renovations. This will help to create a balance between time spent in your home with a renovation underway and time without any renovations in progress.


For example, ask your spouse for at least six months without renovations once a project is completed.

 Vintage champagne, which comes with years printed on the label, should be served between 54 and 57 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature is best achieved by using an ice bucket. An ice bucket usually has a slightly warmer temperature than you would get in your fridge., Grab a bucket big enough to contain a bottle of champagne. Fill the bucket with ice. Submerge the champagne bottle into the ice, so just the tip of the bottle sticks out.You can use a small thermometer to test the temperature of your ice bucket. You can add more ice to chill the bucket more. You can also add a small amount of water if the bucket needs to cool down.
 Simply let the champagne bottle sit in the bucket. You can set a timer on your phone or just keep an eye on the clock., After 20 to 30 minutes have passed, you can pop the cork on the champagne bottle. Make sure to aim the tip of the bottle away from any expensive objects before popping the cork. To serve, tilt the bottle at a 45 degree angle and fill a glass three quarters of the way full with champagne.

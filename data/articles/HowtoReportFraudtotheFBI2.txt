 Disaster-related fraud may include insurance fraud or public benefits fraud, and the perpetrators may include individuals or business contractors involved in disaster recovery.


The Disaster Fraud Task Force was initially established to deal with fraud occurring in the wake of the Hurricane Katrina disaster. As additional natural disasters occurred, the task force became involved with safeguarding the disaster relief efforts in those contexts as well.Disaster-related fraud deals with individuals and businesses that attempt to extort or manipulate innocent victims and government agencies to illegally profit off of the generosity of those trying to help victims of natural disasters.For example, individuals may hold themselves out as representatives of a legitimate charity to take money for themselves that people donate to help natural disaster victims, or may create a fraudulent charity that takes donations and does nothing for the people it purports to help.In other cases, people may file fake or inflated insurance claims in an attempt to get more money than they are rightfully owed as a result of a natural disaster.Keep in mind that many of these types of fraud, especially insurance fraud, cost everyone money in the form of higher insurance costs and increased costs to recover and rebuild areas destroyed by natural disasters., Before you file your report, have copies available of any documents or other materials that provide evidence of the fraudulent activity.


If you are a third-party witness to the activity, it may be difficult to get your hands on any actual documents or proof that the fraud is occurring. However, any information you have can be used by the task force to track down the perpetrators.
 The federal government operates a Disaster Fraud Task Force which coordinates the efforts of several different government agencies involved in disaster relief with law enforcement agencies such as the FBI.

 With the tables you can set them in your driveway and put your items on them. Boxes can contain free items or items all costing the same. Blankets can be used to put clothes/shoes on them.;
, With pricing labels you don't have to write all the prices down. If you can't find any just buy a large roll of duct tape or white/blue tape and write prices on it with a marker.
 If you can't find any you can make your own with cardboard, a stick, and duct tape.


Use duct tape to tape stick to the back
Make letters and arrow with duct tape, or find markers.
 A jewelry box with a lock, a cash box, or anything else can work if you don't have the money to buy anything.
 If you have somewhere to sit down you won't get as tired.

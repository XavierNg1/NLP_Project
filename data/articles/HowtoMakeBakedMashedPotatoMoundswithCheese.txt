 Put it on the stove to boil.;
, Leave them to cook till they are half-done. This should take about 30 minutes.
 Make sure you don't boil the potatoes completely because they might be too soft later. Boil them so that they are a bit hard on the inside but soft enough to be eaten.
 Strain out the potatoes and mash them well.
 Press the scooped up mashed potato onto a cooking sheet or baking dish, leaving a neat mound of mashed potato on the surface. Flatten the top using a knife.
 Flatten each mound with a knife, as with the first mound.
 Sprinkle a little freshly ground black pepper atop each scoop. Add just a bit of salt as well, to taste.
 Check one potato mound, making sure that the potato mixture has become soft. If not, bake for another 2 minutes.
 Gently remove the mounds from the baking dish and place them along with your meal.
 Enjoy this dish with your meal!

 The best known specialty tool is the Bracelet Buddy, but there are a few brands on the market, which typically consist of a plastic handle and an alligator clip at the other end. While it’s especially helpful for people with arthritis or fine motor disabilities, it can make putting on a bracelet easier for anyone who’s had difficulty doing it alone.You can purchase bracelet fastening tools on a variety of websites, including Amazon.
 It helps to lay the bracelet flat on a table or counter to ensure that there are no tangles or kinks in the chain. Take the end of the bracelet without the clasp, and gently close the tool’s clip over it. Make sure that the clip is firmly closed over the end, so it won’t slip loose when you attempt to fasten the bracelet.The clip on the tool usually has a protective coating to keep it from damaging the bracelet, but take care when attaching it to make sure that you don’t scratch the jewelry.
 You should grasp the tool's handle against the palm of your hand, so the clip with the bracelet attached is facing toward you. Use your free hand to wrap the bracelet around your wrist, and carefully open the clasp to secure it to the other end. It’s a good idea to give the bracelet a gentle tug to ensure that the clasp is completely closed.While these specialty tools are usually marketed specifically for bracelets, you can also use them to close wristwatches by yourself.

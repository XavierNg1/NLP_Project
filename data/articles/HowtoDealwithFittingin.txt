 It doesn't have to be in person, if it makes you nervous. You could call or text them or even Facebook message them; however, make sure that if you use the media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) make sure it's a private conversation. If others get involved it can be kind of awkward.
 If you're trying to work it out, don't make things worse by talking badly about others. If you are having trouble at home too and the problem is just becoming bigger and bigger and its greatly affecting you life then go to a school counselor., If nothing is helping then maybe decide to give yourself break for a little while. If that doesn't help, just ask someone nice if you can hang out with them. It's going to be hard to gather the courage, but inside it's all gonna go well. At that time you might feel like it's all distracting you from your real problem and all you can think about is the bad things and not your work, you're going to have to try hard to be loyal to others and yourself. This may mean sitting alone at lunch or at recess. All matters is that you're going to be fine. Just focus on the good things, not the bad things., Rely on them as your confidants and source of support. Realize that some people tend to put labels on others like ugly, mean, stupid, popular, losers, etc. It's not right, but just ignore it. None of it is ever true. Most times people are just jealous or inwardly confused, so they insult others. Make sure you are loyal and trustworthy to everyone because they will learn you are a good person and you will have many friends in no time!

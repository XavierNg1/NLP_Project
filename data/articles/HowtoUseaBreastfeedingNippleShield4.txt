 Caring for the nipple shield is also important. After use, the nipple shield should be rinsed with cold water and then washed with a mixture of hot water and soap. After using the hot water and soap, rinse it with cold water again.Take note that you should not put soap directly on the nipple shield. Instead, fill a basin with hot water and then add soap to it, mixing it thoroughly. This is important to remember because when soap is placed directly on the nipple shield, it could compromise the integrity of the shield. The soap could be ingested by your infant, making him sick.
This process will help eliminate dirt and grime.
 The nipple shield should be dried. To do this, pat it down with a fresh, clean cloth and then store it in a container that is sealed and airtight. This will ensure that no bacteria or virus will get on it.


It also means that there will be no need to clean it before you feed your child next time.
 If you have been sick, or your child has been sick, boil the nipple shield in hot water and soap for two to three minutes. This will help to eliminate any lingering bacteria or viruses.

 Briars, weeds, and tall grass are all well-known hiding spots for chiggers. Pulling weeds and keeping your grass short is a simple yet effective way to get rid of any chiggers living in your yard. Removing these elements removes the shade and moisture chiggers thrive in. Sunlight and good air circulation create a discouraging atmosphere for chiggers to live in.
You should also regularly prune your trees, bushes, and other shrubs to lower the humidity around those plants and allow more sunlight to filter in.
Continue these practices year round. Dormant chiggers can still return once the weather warms up, so to get rid of them completely, you need to make the habitat as unfriendly as possible at all times.;
, Reptiles, amphibians, and small mammals are favorite hosts among chiggers. Discouraging these animals from hanging around your garden or yard may also cause the chiggers to leave since they will instinctively want to follow their food source.


Remove sources of water that invite reptiles and amphibians.
The removal of dense foliage or shrubbery can discourage small mammals that might otherwise use these areas as convenient hiding places.
Secure lids onto your trashcans and consider setting up fencing around the perimeter of your garden or yard.
 If you need a natural, organic pesticide for severe chigger infestations, you can do a broadcast application of diatomaceous earth to help ward off chiggers and other garden and lawn pests.


This is a natural product formed soft sedimentary rock, which in turn was produced by small, fossilized creatures called diatoms. It comes in the form of a fine white or off-white powder.
Sprinkle diatomaceous earth around the perimeter of your yard and over any areas that may offer ideal conditions for chiggers to live in. These areas include anything that may be overgrown or any area that offers a good hiding place, shade, and moisture. Focus on tall grass, weeds, and briars.

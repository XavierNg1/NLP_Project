, This will prevent the pizza from sticking to the tray when it is done. cornmeal, which is found at most supermarkets, is the classic "restaurant style" ingredient.


If you are using a pizza stone, apply the cornmeal and then put the stone in the oven to pre-heat.
 If your pizza stone is pre-heating, put a little flour on the countertop and lay out your dough. If you are using a regular tray simply put your dough right on the surface.
 Leave an inch of dough around the edge of the crust uncovered.
 Sprinkle your cheese blend evenly across the sauce. While mozzarella is the most frequent pizza cheese, try mixing in shredded Romano, Parmesan, provolone, Asiago, or a few dollops of Ricotta.
 If you are baking two pizzas at once and they are on different oven racks, switch them halfway through cooking to ensure that both cook evenly.

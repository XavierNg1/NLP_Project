 Add approximately 1 cup (237 ml) of hot espresso to a large mug with 2 tablespoons (16 g) of sugar-free hot chocolate mix. Mix the two together until they’re well blended.You can substitute chocolate syrup for the hot chocolate mix, but a powdered mix usually works best.
 Pour ½ cup (118 ml) of skim milk into a small saucepan, and set it on the stove. Turn the heat to low, and allow the milk to heat for approximately 1 minute to steam it lightly.Whisk the milk constantly as you warm it to help make it frothy and create foam.
Be careful not to heat the milk too long. It can burn easily.
 After you’ve warmed the milk, add it to the espresso and chocolate mixture. You can add as much or as little as you’d like., You can add whipped cream to the top of your latte or sprinkle it with shaved chocolate. Cocoa powder, ground cinnamon, or ground nutmeg are also ideal toppings.Keep in mind that any toppings that you add to the latte will make it less “skinny.” If you want to keep the calories and fat down in your beverage, it’s best to keep the toppings simple.

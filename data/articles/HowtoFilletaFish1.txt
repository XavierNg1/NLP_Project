 You can buy a filleting knife that is designed for the specific purpose of filleting fish; these work quite well. However, if you aren't in the market for a brand new knife, find one with a long, thin, and quite sharp blade. This will enable you to cleanly cut the fish's meat away from the bones.









Don't use a serrated knife to fillet a fish; it will shred the delicate meat.
Sharpen your knife's blade before getting to work.;
, Filleting a fish can be rather messy, so it's good to set up a workspace ahead of time. You'll need a large cutting board. You can line it with newspaper or butcher paper for easy clean up. Set out a clean plate for the fillets.
 Rinse it well in cold water. You can pat it dry with a paper towel if you'd like. Lay the fish horizontally on the cutting board with the bottom of the fish facing you.

 iPod classic models are a variety of early iPods that aren't necessarily numbered by Generation. The classic line includes the original iPod (2001) through the "iPod classic 160 GB." This was the last model made in 2009.
 This is the easiest way to get an idea of what model iPod you have.


A full color screen means the iPod is a 4th Generation (2005) or newer.
A monochrome display means the iPod is 4th Generation or older. Yes, the 4th Generation had a color and a monochrome model. The monochrome 4th Generation has four control buttons in a row beneath the screen.
 The iPod classic line has gone through several control revisions. This will help you determine the Generation.


All 4th generation and newer iPod classics have a Click Wheel interface. This is a circular touchpad that you can press in to click.
The 3rd Generation has a Click Wheel and a Dock Connector on the bottom. It also has four control buttons beneath the display.
2nd Generation iPods have Touch Wheels. There are buttons in a circle along the outside of the wheel.
1st Generation iPods have Scroll Wheels. This physically moves as you move your finger.
 The color can help you find the difference between the newer Generations.


6th Generation iPods (iPod classic X GB models) come in either silver or black and have an anodized aluminum finish.
5th Generation iPods (iPod with video) come in either black or white with a glossy finish.
4th Generation iPods (iPod with color) come in white with a glossy finish.
 If you can't visually identify the Generation, you can check the model number.

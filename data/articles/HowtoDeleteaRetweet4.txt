 Occasionally, somebody you don't follow will tweet something, which will then be retweeted by somebody you do follow. You can recognize those by the gray "retweeted" just above the tweet, along with a green retweet icon.
 Click or tap on the name of the user as it appears above the retweet.
 The button is just to the left of the blue "Following" button. Tap or click on the cog to see a drop-down menu of options.
 This will prevent you from seeing any future retweets that the user makes. You cannot delete retweets from others from your timeline, so your only recourse, should it become a problem, is to selectively turn off retweets from specific users. Also, there is no method for bulk blocking of retweets. You have to deal with each user individually. To reduce the clutter, visit the home page of the users that you follow.


You will still see the user's original tweets.
Note that this is not retroactive: all previous retweets will remain on your timeline.

 Measure out 1 tablespoon of psyllium husk and pour it into a bowl. Add 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water.








You can find psyllium husk in the health section of your grocery store. You can also find it in a health food store.
 As it soaks, you may notice that it starts to thicken. Don't worry if it looks too runny at this point., You can leave your slime clear, if you want to, or you can add in some food coloring to make it look more interesting. Gel-based food coloring will work the best, but you could try liquid if you have nothing else.Do not add glitter. You will need to microwave this.
 Keep stirring until the texture is consistent. If you added food coloring, keep stirring until the color is even and no streaks remain.
 Do not step away from the microwave. Keep a close eye on the slime. When it starts to bubble over, pause the microwave, and let the slime "deflate". When the slime is level again, start the microwave up again, and let it finish heating.You may have to pause the microwave more than once.
 When you take the bowl out of the microwave, you will be left with an icky, gooey, and somewhat-chunky slime. It is a little too hot to play with, however, so tuck it into the fridge to cool off. This may take a couple of minutes., This slime is thick, gooey, and jiggly. You can even add some items into it, such as googly eyes. When you are done playing with the slime, put it into an airtight container.

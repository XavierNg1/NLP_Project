 This is a half-circle dome shaped gemstone-cut used for Jewelry making. You'll also need the cabochon tray, which is the metallic part into which the cabochon fits. Both items can be found in such places as craft stores, Jewelry suppliers or online sites that cater to Jewelry making.
 You can hold it in your hand or place it on a concave item, such as a piece of foam with a dent in it. You could also use a big blob of poster tack attached to the rounded part and pressed against a non-slip surface. Use anything that will stop the cabochon from rocking as you work on it.
 If adding glitter, do so now and use the brush to spread it about a bit. Allow to dry. Drying time will take about an hour.


Don't overdo adding the glitter. If it's lumpy, the cabochon won't fit snugly into the tray later.
Instead of painting a layer, you might like to try a design, such as a love heart first, then paint a background layer over the design. This is more finicky but looks really effective.
Another approach is to swirl different colors together across the flat part; take care not to mingle them up too much though, try to keep the swirls distinctive.
 At this stage, it might be enough nail polish but you can decide that once this layer has dried. Two layers is often enough for strong, opaque nail polish colors, while another layer or two might be needed for weaker, more transparent polish colors. Again, allow to dry thoroughly between each layer.
 This will ensure that it is completely dry.
 Use a blob of strong glue and apply this to the tray. Press the flat side of the painted cabochon onto the tray, spreading the glue under the force of your pressure.


If any glue pops up around the edges, simply wipe it away before it dries.
 When it is dry, turn it into a piece of Jewelry, such as a necklace, bracelet, ring or earrings.
 It'll be an unusual piece that nobody else has anywhere.

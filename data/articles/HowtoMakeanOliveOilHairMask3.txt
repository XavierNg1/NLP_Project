 Bananas are high in nutrients such as vitamins A and E and antioxidants, which foster healthy hair. The sugar and pectin in bananas will also help keep moisture in your hair.This mask is perfect for hair that's dry from over-processing or coloring.
 Whisk vigorously until the mixture is fairly smooth. You may have some small lumps of banana remaining; that's all right. Just try to break down any large chunks.


You can also puree the banana and olive oil in a food processor or blender, if you have one. This technique will create a more thoroughly emulsified mixture.
 Raw organic honey is best for this, because it is highest in antioxidants, but any honey will work. Make sure the mixture is thoroughly combined.
 Focus on the ends, where most of the damage usually is. Make sure the mask is evenly distributed and that you don't have any huge chunks of banana in your hair.
 If you have long hair, put it into a ponytail or loose bun, or secure it with a hairclip before wrapping. Leave on hair for 30 minutes.
 This mask is quite sticky, so make sure you have completely rinsed it out! Follow with a gentle shampoo and conditioner.

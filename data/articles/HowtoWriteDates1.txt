 When writing informally, shortened forms of the date are fine. You can use dashes or backslashes between the date, like so: 8-2-2011 or 8/2/2011.


Another alternative that isn’t used as often is using periods or underscores, sometimes done in coding or file names. For example: 8.2.2011 or 8_2_2011.;
, This would be written either as 08/02/2011 or as 8/2/2011. The extra digit in front of the eight and two does help clarify the month, but it’s not necessary.
 This method works well in emails, memos, notes, and the like.
 For example, you would write: August 2, 2011. This method works fine for resumes and formal academic papers.


Sometimes, writers add in the day of the week as well “Saturday, August 2, 2011.”
Use this method on letters, more formal emails, essays, and so on.

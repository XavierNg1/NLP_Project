 To have a joint tenancy, you both must acquire equal shares at the same time.


Preparing a new deed has the effect of you selling your property to you and your relative.Joint tenancy with right of survivorship means that when one of you dies, the other takes all interest in the property by operation of law.Keep in mind that since you are giving someone an interest in your property, you will owe gift taxes if that share of your property is worth more than $10,000., Since the only thing you are changing are the names on the deed, you can simply copy everything else on your older deed.
 Depending on your state's law, you may need to sign the deed in front of a notary public or other witnesses.


Since you and your relative both are taking ownership of the property in this situation, you both must sign the deed.
 If you want to avoid probate, the deed must be recorded or the joint tenancy won't be a matter of public record.

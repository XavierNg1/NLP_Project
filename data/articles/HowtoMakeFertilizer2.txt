 Mix together Epsom Salts, baking powder, salt peter, and ammonia with a gallon (4 liters) of water for an all-around fertilizer. This mixture is good for any plant type, and should be sprayed once every 4-6 weeks. To make it, simply combine the ingredients with a gallon (4 liters) of water and shake or mix until completely dissolved:


1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) Epsom Salts
1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) baking powder
1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) saltpeter
1/2 teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) ammonia., Mix 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) Epsom salts with 1 gallon (4 liters) water for an even easier liquid fertilizer. Epsom salts contain both magnesium and sulfur acids, which help plants stay healthy and gives added flavor to a variety of vegetables. Once a month, mix up 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of Epsom salts with 1 gallon (4 liters) water and use this to water your plants.


Roses, in particular, love Epsom salt baths. You can use a tablespoon of salt for each foot the rose bush is tall, mixing in a gallon of water and using twice a year-- once the leaves appear and right after the first series of blooms.Epsom salt baths can help make up for soil that is low in magnesium and sulfur.
While an Epsom salt bath will help your plants sprout, you will need to give them nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium to keep them growing.
 Sprinkle Epsom salt over the soil of new plants, using a rough tablespoon for each plant. You can sprinkle a tablespoon of Epsom salts on top of the soil for your new seedlings, as they help promote strong, early growth. This is best done right when you transfer the plants from pots or planters into the soil. As you water the plants, they will slowly dissolve the Epsom salts into the soil.

Converting a regular barbecue sauce recipe into a low carb barbecue sauce is a matter of making substitutions. Sugars, fruit juices, molasses and syrups are all common items in barbecue sauce recipes. To make the recipe low carb you need to identify the ingredients high in carbs and substitute them for those that are low in carbs. Sugar-free syrups and artificial sweeteners are all good substitutions for sweet ingredients.;

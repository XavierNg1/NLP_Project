 It should be thick enough to add some bulk to the paper, but thin enough for you to be able to cut it easily. You can take apart a cereal box, use a piece of cardboard, or even take apart an old shoe box or cardboard box.









To spice up your boomerang, you can pick a piece of cardboard with a pattern on it, or even draw your own pattern on the cardboard.
 Use a marker, pen, or pencil to draw three separate prongs of equal size and shape. If you want the boomerang to fly well, the three sides should be as equally-shaped as possible.









If you want your boomerang to be as uniformly shaped as possible, you can cut one prong out of a different piece of paper and use it as an outline for the three prongs of the boomerang. This will ensure that they really are the same size and shape.
 Use thick scissors to cut along the pattern that you traced. The boomerang should feel nice and sturdy once you've cut it out. If you don't want the part you drew to be shown, you can cut slightly inside your drawing, or place the drawing on the back of the side that you want to face up at the beginning. That way, it won't be visible even if you leave the outline on the boomerang.
 Turn the boomerang over and fold the right side of all of the prongs back slightly. Fold just one inch (2.5 cm) of the boomerang back just a tiny bit -- about 1/8th of an inch (.3 cm). Make sure you've folded the same side of each prong the same amount.
 Take your boomerang outside or to a cleared space and practice throwing it. It's all in the wrist -- just hold on to one of the prongs of the boomerang with your thumb and forefinger and throw it forward. Make sure it's parallel to the ground when you throw it so it doesn't instantly fall downward.

 You will need to go to the Pillow Room in Jamaa Township. Announce you want to adopt a dragon. Eventually, someone with a dragon mask and wings will come.;
, First, you need to buddy your "pet" dragon. Then, take him or her to your den. Get to know the dragon by asking it questions. "How old are you?" "What is your name?" "What type of dragon are you?"

, Remember, you need something that will be realistic. You will need to fence a pen for your dragon. Give him or her a bowl of water, food, toys, and a bed, which can be bought in Claws 'N Paws in Appondale.
 You will need to interact with the dragon. Be sure to consider that "real" dragons cannot talk. Try training, taming, exercising, and playing with your dragon. Ask him or her their favorite activity.
 You have finally got your pet dragon! Now, to keep a long time friendship, try to interact with your dragon whenever he or she is online.

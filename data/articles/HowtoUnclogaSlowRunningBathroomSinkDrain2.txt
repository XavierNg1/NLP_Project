 For this method, you only need a flashlight and a plunger (you can buy a smaller one specifically made for sinks at any hardware store but a thoroughly cleaned toilet plunger works just as well).
 This step is crucial otherwise you will just be plunging the stopper up and down rather than forcing up the clog.


Use your hands to pull the sink stopper up as far as it will go out of the drain. Then turn it to the left and continue unscrewing until it comes out., You want to fill the sink with some water but just enough to cover the drain. An inch or so of water should be just fine.
 Place the plunger directly over the drain and press down once until you feel rubber bottom tighten into a seal. You may have to stand on a chair to make sure you are positioned directly over the sink., Using the handle of the plunger, plunge vigorously up and down about 10-20 times.Make sure that the plunger is tightly sealed around the drain, creating suction, so that the plunger is actually forcing the blockage through.
 Shine a flashlight into the drain to check for the blockage. If you can see it and can reach with your fingers and pull it out, do so. If not, repeat the steps until the clog comes out.

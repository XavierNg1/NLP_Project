 Make sure that the baking rack is in the upper third of your oven.
 Tear about 3 slices of bread into small chunks, enough to fill 1 cup (50 grams). Pour the milk into a bowl, then add the torn bread. Let the bread soak until it softens, about 4 minutes.
 Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot and sizzling, add the pancetta, onion, and garlic. Season it with salt and pepper, then cook until the onion turns soft. This will take about 6 minutes. Set the mixture aside to cool when you're done.You can use Canadian bacon instead of pancetta.The best size skillet to work with is 10 inches (25.4 centimeters).
 This will remove any excess milk. Pour the milk out when you are done, then set the bread aside.
 To save mixing bowls, beat the egg with a fork or mini whisk in a large mixing bowl first, then add the chicken. It is best to use freshly-ground chicken (as the butcher at your grocery if he or she can do it for you).
 Stir the ingredients together using a rubber spatula or a wooden spoon until everything is evenly combined.
 Use a spoon to scoop out the meat, and your hands to roll it into a ball. This will help ensure that each ball is the same size.
 A 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02 centimeters) size would be ideal.Make sure that the meatballs are not touching, or they won't cook properly.
 In a small bowl, briskly mix together 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of tomato paste. You can do this using a fork or a mini whisk. Don't worry if the two don't mix together perfectly. Once you are done, use a basting brush to coat each meatball with the mixture., If they still need some cooking, bake them for another 5 minutes, then test them again. The meat must be completely cooked through; if it's still pink inside, you need to cook it longer.
 You can serve them as they are with some sauce, or you can add them to your favorite pasta dish.

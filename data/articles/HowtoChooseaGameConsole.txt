 At the risk of overgeneralizing, Nintendo has traditionally targeted kids and families, Microsoft's Xbox is a "guy" console, and Sony's PlayStation caters to a variety of crowds.;
, Nintendo's new motion-sensing controller provides the most physically active experience of the three consoles.


If you want a family console, Wii is definitely the best choice.
 Here at the dawn of the 7th generation of console gaming, Sony PlayStation 3 costs $400, Microsoft Xbox 360 costs $250, $300, or $400 (depending on equipment), and Nintendo's Wii is the low-price leader at $250. Traditionally, the winner of the previous generation of consoles lasts into the next era, so the $130 PlayStation 2 should also be readily available for a few years.
 As in past years, PlayStation is predicted to have the greatest number of titles, and thanks to backward compatibility (not present in all console versions) also has an enormous back catalog of games from PlayStation 1 and 2. The Wii also brings back the retro-games with it's "virtual console.". The Xbox 360 has great online features and exclusive games like GTA IV: The Lost and the Damned, The Halo series, and many other Xbox exclusive games.
 Nintendo's lack of a DVD player and hard drive account for much of its lower price; Microsoft and Sony add things like storage capacity and better cables at their more expensive price points. But, with broadband Internet connection, the Wii can go online with Opera and even to sites with Flash 7! Currently developing WiFi technology will also allow more multi-player play.
 As Blu-Ray compatibility is a key selling point of the PlayStation 3, it also accounts the most for the large price. The Wii is still developing it's DVD system, but it might be released only within Japan.

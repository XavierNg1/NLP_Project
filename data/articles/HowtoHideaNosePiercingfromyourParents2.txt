 You should also put powder on your face. Use a highly concentrated concealer with a concealer brush.


Brush the concealer over the piercing. Work the product into the area. Choose a color that is closely matched to your skin.
Take a sponge to blend the makeup into the area so that it looks natural

, Use the outside of the bandage. Cut it into a small strip with a pair of scissors. Put the tiny strip on your face over the nose ring.


Then, hold it down with tweezers as you stick it back on, and then cut around it so that it covers the nose ring. Cut the edges to make it almost look like a circle.
Then take liquid bandage and put two coats on the small piece. You should be able to buy this at many department stores. It will smell like nail polish. Apply it over the small bandage over the piercing. Put on two or three coats, and let it dry.Complete the process by placing makeup foundation over the piercing with a makeup sponge.
 Nose piercings can take longer to heal than ear piercing. That’s because the ears are made of softer tissue than the nose.


Don’t use a stud or a ring that’s too big to fit your nose or you could develop some scar tissue. Leave the piercing alone. Don’t tug on it, or you could also cause scar tissue.
You can also wear the retainer while the nose is healing. Make sure that you use sterile procedures – keeping the piercing clean – when you change nose piercings.

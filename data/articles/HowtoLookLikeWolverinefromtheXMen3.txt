However, if you cannot find one at a store or online, use a basic black wig with short hair. Use a hairbrush to tease the hair on the wig into the shape of Wolverine's hair. Part the wig down the middle. On each side, take a brush and back comb gently until the hair sticks up a little on either side. When you're done, you should have hair that's parted in the center and poking upright on either side.

 Wash the tomato in cold water and pat dry with some paper towel. Remove the stem., Using a sharp knife and a chopping board, slice the tomato into four evenly sized wedges., The side with the seeds should be facing up. Work with one tomato wedge at a time, holding it firmly against the chopping board., Starting at one edge of the tomato wedge, carefully slice the tomato skin away from the flesh. Try to only remove the skin, keeping at much of the flesh intact as possible. Work from one side of the wedge to the other, until the skin has been removed completely., Use the same technique to remove the skin from the rest of the tomato wedges. Don't worry if a little of the flesh comes away with the skin, this is normal. This method is good if you prefer not to heat your tomatoes while peeling.

 Carefully pour the paint from the can into your paint tray well. Do not overfill the paint tray or the paint could overflow on the sides. Overfilling the well will also make it harder to load your roller., Starting from the ribbed section of the paint tray, slowly roll your paint roller into the well filled with paint. You don't have to go all the way to the bottom of the well, just go into it enough to saturate your paint roller., Once the roller is saturated, you'll want to roll it back onto the ribbed part of the tray to remove some of the paint. Go back and forth over the ribbed section of the paint tray to get excess paint off your roller., Continue to go back and forth from the well to the ribbed section of the paint tray until your roller is evenly saturated with paint. Once it feels heavy and the paint looks even on the roller, it's loaded.

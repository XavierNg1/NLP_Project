 Stranded cotton is the standard type of thread for hand embroidery. It consists of multiple strands, which you can break apart and use between one and six of the strands at once. Using one strand will create a delicate effect while using more strands will result in a thicker, textured look.If you are new to embroidery, then you may want to start out with this type of floss.
 Perle cotton consists of two strands that are twisted together and cannot be separated. This floss creates a more textured look than stranded cotton. It comes in several different sizes depending on how thick you want it to be.This thread may also appear a bit shiner than stranded cotton, so it is a good option if you want to add a bit of shine.
 These types of cotton thread are straighter and smoother looking than stranded or perle cotton thread. Both are great choices for fine detail work.Cotton floche is made up of four strands that you cannot pull apart. It is great for adding fine details to your project.Coton a broder (French for â€œembroidery cotton) is a lot like cotton floche, but instead of four strands, coton a broder has five strands. It is great for creating tiny designs and fine details., Silk is the natural choice if you want your hand embroidery to be shiny and luxurious looking. Silk floss comes in many different colors, which may even appear more vibrant than cotton floss in the same colors.You can get silk floss in multiple sizes as well to suit the needs of your project.
 Wool thread is also a great option for hand embroidery. You cannot sue wool thread with a machine because it is too rough, but it works well for hand embroidery and you can use it to make plants, animals, and other things in your design look hairy or fuzzy.For example, if you were creating a rabbit, then using a light brown or white wool floss could make the rabbit appear furry.

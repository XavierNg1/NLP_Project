 If you have a sinker or bobber attached to the line, it should be 6 to 12 inches from the rod tip instead.;
, A spincasting rod is designed with a recessed seat and curved projection for you to wrap your index finger around.


Most fishermen cast spincasting gear with the same hand they reel the line in with. If you hold the rod grip behind the reel when you reel in, you'll need to change hands when you cast.
 You may want to angle your body slightly, with the side of your body opposite the hand in which you hold your rod more toward the target area.
 Turning the rod lets you flick your wrist when you cast, so you can cast more naturally and powerfully. Casting with the reel held upright makes you cast more stiffly and robs you of power. If you cast with your opposite hand, the reel handles should point down instead of up.
 The line may drop slightly, but it will stay in place. If the line drops too far, you didn't hold the button firmly enough. Reel the line up and try again.
 As you do, raise your rod until its tip goes slightly past vertical.
 This is about 30 degrees above horizontal, or the "10 o'clock" position.
 Your bait or lure should be propelled forward toward the target area. If it hits the water in front of you, you released the button too late. If it flies upward, you release the button too soon.
 This will brake the flight of your bait, "feathering" it down to land where you want it to.

 The most universal, non-verbal way to greet others is a simple handshake or wave, particularly in the English speaking world. However, other gestures such as various forms of bowing, embraces, or even applause are used as non-verbal greetings in other parts of the world. Always make sure you are not insulting anyone with uncommon gestures in that particular country.

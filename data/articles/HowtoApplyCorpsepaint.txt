 Make sure you use enough to make your face at least several shades lighter, but not enough so that you look like a geisha or a clown. Generally, it's a good idea to include your jaw line and neck unless you want a "mask" or "floating face" effect.;
, Though this step can be skipped, it will help keep the white base from smudging/melting off your face or into the rest of the color.

Instead of simply applying it so that it contours to your eye socket, try going for a spider-webbed, stitched, shattered, dripping, or vine-y effect.
 This helps to bring out the eye shadow and your natural eyebrows.

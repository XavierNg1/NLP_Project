 Let your children pick where they want to be within the already set boundaries and what they want to do. This could include a variety of structured and safe choices. This is a time when they don’t have to share anything, or talk with anyone but merely learn how to independently entertain themselves. If presented with enthusiasm on your behalf, this can be viewed as exciting to a young child.


An example could be: “It's me-time and you can sit on the couch or at the table and read a book, draw or play with puzzles.” Being alone tends to be seen as a negative thing because it is so often used as “time-out” or “go to your room by yourself”. Sadly, this simply confuses the growing child who equates solitude with badness. If you encourage alone time as good time, you can quickly buy yourself space when you really need a break, and it won't have negative repercussions.
This is an opportunity for you to present the idea of being alone as a positive aspect in learning self-reliance skills and in life generally and not as a punishment.
 It is not your priority to alleviate a child's boredom––your priority is to provide a safe home environment in which a child explores his or her imagination and unlocks ways to personally resolve boredom. If you constantly remove that chance, it can be harder for such a child to self-soothe and find internal outlets to relieve boredom, possibly leaving the door open to risky behaviors. Give yourself a break and allow time for boredom too.
 As your children grow older, expect more independence from them and give them more unstructured time. Your trust in your children will go a long way to helping them mature healthily, and they will view their independence as a privilege, not something to be afraid of.

 Can you play an instrument already? How long have you been playing? Can you even read music? Your prior experience will have an effect on how much you need to learn, where you need to learn it, and how "simplified" it'll need to be.;
, Some websites offer free music theory lessons, but to get really in-depth, or be able to get a degree out of your learning experience, you'll probably need to pay and provide a good bit of personal information. If you're just learning for fun, you may not want to shell out a couple hundred dollars (or more) to learn the names of the notes.
 There are also some links below, but if you're looking for information on a certain aspect of music theory or aren't satisfied with the listed links, search engines like Google can be a huge help.
 You'll want to look over the search results, omit ones that cost money, look like a scam to you, or don't suit your learning tastes. A good website to learn music theory from will be geared towards your experience and age level, will be easy for you to read, and will allow you to take things at your own pace.
 Many sites will offer self-check quizzes after every lesson or unit of lessons, and you can use these to see how well you're picking this up. You may also wish to practice in real life. You can try transposing a piece of music to a different key, you can take up an instrument like the piano (which is set up in a way that makes it very easy to see the notes and relationships between them) and learn along with your program, or you can even try your hand at composing.
 It won't always stick the first time, but that's the beauty of internet learning... you can revisit certain lessons again and again.
 Choose an instrument to study, improve your skills at your current one, start composing music, or just enjoy being more musically knowledgeable and experienced.

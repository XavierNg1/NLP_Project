 A tambourine should be held in your non-dominant hand. Wrap your four fingers underneath the frame of the instrument and rest your thumb lightly against the head (if your tambourine has no head, rest your thumb across the top edge of the frame). Angle the head of the tambourine towards your dominant hand so that you have ample room to strike the head. Do not apply more pressure to the head with your non-dominant hand than necessary, as this will mute the sound.;
, Many tambourines have a mounting hole drilled in the frame; avoid placing your finger through this hole during play. This can mute the instrument's sound and make it difficult to pick it up and put it down without making unwanted noise. Also avoid clutching the tambourine any tighter than is required to keep it steady; this can lead to fatigue.

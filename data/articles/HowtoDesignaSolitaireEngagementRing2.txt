 Typically solitaire engagement rings come in 2 metals: gold and platinum. Gold solitaire rings can be made from yellow or white gold. White gold is more popular for engagement rings; it is formed by mixing yellow gold and other white alloys. Women most prefer platinum, because it is more pure, eternal and rare. Don’t forget to check the markings to be sure about the quality of the chosen metal.
 The band is represented by the metal round circle, which sits around the finger. The right choice of the style and the size of the band is very important and predetermined by the hand and fingers size and shape, as well as the diamond’s characteristics. If the diamond is small and the fingers are small and slender wide and massive bands can never be a good option. Bands should fit well to the proportions. Bands can be straight or curved. Usually a curved band has the straight base and is curved at the top, where the diamond is fixed. Other shapes include: softly rounded, high domed/dome rounded, flat. A soft rounded shape is the most common and convenient for engagement rings.

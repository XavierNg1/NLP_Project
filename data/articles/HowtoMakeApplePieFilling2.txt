 Use an apple corer, vegetable peeler and mandolin to save time during the preparation process.


Juice 1 lemon. Pour the juice into a bowl. Toss the sliced apples with the apple juice as you slice the rest of the apples.
Lemon juice keeps the apples from turning brown immediately.



Stick them in boiling water for 1 minute.
Alternatively, you can pour boiling water over them and let them sit for 10 minutes to keep them crisper longer. Drain them well and set them aside.
 Add 3/4 cup (150g) of granulated sugar, 1/4 cup (40g) of Clear Jel canning thickener, 1/2 tsp. (1.3g) of cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. (0.3g) of nutmeg to a large, unheated saucepan.


Clear Jel canning thickener is used in place of cornstarch or flour. #*This specialty product is a modified form of cornstarch and it is safe to use for canning and storing foods.
Mix these dry ingredients with a wooden spoon.
 Stir your sugar mixture into your liquid mixture with the wooden spoon.



Stir the mixture regularly while it heats.
 Once the liquid sugar mixture reaches a simmer, add the drained, blanched apples to the saucepan.


Stir the apple mixture.
Wait until the apples are heated through, approximately 5 minutes.



Sterilize your jars before canning them. After washing them in the dishwasher, place them in a boiling hot water bath for 10 minutes.
Pour the hot apple pie filling into hot canning jars using a funnel and ladle.
Pour apple pie filling into plastic containers for freezing.
Place sterilized jars and lids on the apple pie filling jars. Place them in a water bath for 25 to 30 minutes.
 Place it into a pastry crust and bake for 35 to 45 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius).

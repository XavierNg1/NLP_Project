 Instead of taping white paper to a wall, try taping blue paper to the wall. Repeat this experiment with red, green, and yellow paper., You can conduct the same light mixing experiment by shining the flashlights (without cellophane) through colored water. Use food coloring to make red, green, and blue water. Shine the flashlights through the side of the cups to project the light on a wall.Be sure to use glass or clear plastic cups.
 Stage lights allow you to adjust the brightness. Use red, green, and blue stage light filters to mix colors. Throughout this experiment, adjust the brightness of the light to create different hues., Cut off the tops of red, green, and blue glow sticks and pour the contents into three separate plastic cups. Lay down a black garbage bag. With a plastic pipette mix one drop of two of the colors on the garbage bag. Notice what happens when you mix red and green, green and blue, and blue and red.


This experiment works best in a darkened room.
The contents of glow sticks are not toxic, but general precautions should be taken to prevent ingestion or excessive skin contact.

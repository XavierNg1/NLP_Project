 This lightening spray calls for dried chamomile flowers, lemon essential oil, cinnamon essential oil, and cassia essential oil.You will also need a large mixing bowl and a spray bottle made of dark glass that will hold approximately 1.5 cups (12 fluid ounces) of liquid. Having a funnel on hand will also be helpful. The exact recipe is:


1/2 cup dried chamomile flowers;
30-40 drops cinnamon essential oil;
30-40 drops lemon essential oil;
15-20 drops cassia essential oil.
 Measure out ½ cup of dried chamomile flowers and put them in a large mixing bowl. Carefully pour 1 cup of boiled water over them. Allow the chamomile flowers to soak until the water cools down to room temperature (this will take about 30 minutes).Strain the chamomile flowers out of the water after steeping them for about 30 minutes.
Dispose of the used chamomile flowers.
 After removing the used chamomile flowers, add the cinnamon essential oil, lemon essential oil and cassia oil directly to the water in the bowl. Use a wooden spoon (or other non-reactive utensil) to mix the water and oils together., Make sure the bottle is clean and empty first, then transfer the formula into a dark glass spray bottle. Light exposure will cause essential oils to degrade, which is why the dark glass is important – it will protect the oils from losing their potency.
 You can spray it onto dry or damp hair. Then comb through your locks to evenly distribute the ingredients. Use this formula on your hair whenever you plan to be outside in the sun.


The sunlight activates the ingredients to lighten your hair. The longer you spend in the sunlight, the more results you will see.This method is very gentle and the highlights will develop gradually.
 Make sure to keep the bottle out of direct sunlight. By keeping the bottle in a cool place with no light exposure, you will prevent the essential oils from losing their effectiveness.


Shake the bottle well before each application.

 In a large bucket or other container, stir together 3 cups (750 ml) white distilled vinegar, 2 cups (500 ml) hair conditioner, and 6 cups (1500 ml) hot water until evenly combined.You can use any hair conditioner you want for this method. To make it more cost effective, choose a cheap brand.
Since there are many varieties and scents of conditioner available on the market, your scent options are nearly endless.
Note that this is not an "all natural" solution, but it is quite effective. The vinegar strips aways stiffening residue and the conditioner softens fibers.
 For a normal load, fill a fabric softener ball with 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup (60 ml to 125 ml) of the fabric softener solution or add the same amount directly to the washer just before the rinse cycle begins.


Do not add the fabric softener to the machine before its primary wash cycle.
Pour the rest of the fabric softener into a storage container. Shake or stir well to combine before each use.
 You do not need to do anything special from this point on. Let your rinse cycle finish up as it normally would.

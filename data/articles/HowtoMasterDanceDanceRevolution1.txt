 As long as the machine is in good working order, you will not need to stamp your feet for it to register a step. It is all about timing. Stamping your feet violently will only tire you out and hurt your feet.;
, Do not disturb someone while they are playing. Wait for them to complete the song or their game and then have a word with them. It doesn't matter how good you are, do not make fun of new players. You should encourage them to improve. If you have a huge ego then you will never progress past your own faults, but if you coach others, then you will be respected and admired as a true DDR master.

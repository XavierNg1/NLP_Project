 We use cross multiplication for math problems where we know the fractions are equivalent, but one of the numbers has been replaced with a variable (typically x) for which we must solve. In cases like this, we know these fractions are equivalent because they're the sole terms on opposite sides of an equal sign, but it's often not obvious how to solve for the variable. Luckily, with cross multiplication, solving these types of problems is easy., In other words, you multiply the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other and vice versa, then set these two answers equal to each other and solve.Take our two examples of 4/8 and 8/16. These two don't contain a variable, but we can prove the concept since we already know they're equivalent. By cross multiplying, we get 4 x 16 = 8 x 8, or 64 = 64, which is obviously true. If the two numbers are not the same, then the fractions are not equivalent.
 Since cross multiplication is the easiest way to determine equivalent fractions when you must solve for a variable, let's add a variable.


For example, let's consider the equation 2/x = 10/13. To cross multiply, we multiply 2 by 13 and 10 by x, then set our answers equal to each other:

2 × 13 = 26
10 × x = 10x
10x = 26. From here, getting an answer for our variable is a matter of simple algebra. x = 26/10 = 2.6, making the initial equivalent fractions 2/2.6 = 10/13.
 One of the best things about cross multiplication is that it works in essentially the same way whether you're dealing with two simple fractions (as above) or with more complex fractions. For instance, if both fractions contain variables, you just have to eliminate these variables at the end during the solving process. Similarly, if the numerators or denominators of your fractions contain variable expressions (such as x + 1), simply "multiply through"by using the distributive property and solve as you normally would.For instance, let's consider the equation ((x + 3)/2) = ((x + 1)/4). In this case, as above, we'll solve by cross multiplying:

(x + 3) × 4 = 4x + 12
(x + 1) × 2 = 2x + 2
2x + 2 = 4x + 12, then we can simplify the equation by subtracting 2x from both sides
2 = 2x + 12, then we should isolate the variable by subtracting 12 from both sides
-10 = 2x, and divide by 2 to solve for x

-5 = x

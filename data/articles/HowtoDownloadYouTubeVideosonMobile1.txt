 Since there is no way to download videos from either the Safari browser or YouTube app, you will need to get a third party app from the Store in order to download videos to your iOS device., In the Search field, enter Video Downloader and carefully look through the results. There are many apps with similar names that may or may not offer the same functionality. The app we will be using for this guide is Video Downloader Lite Super â€“ Vdownload by George Young. Download and install the app when you find it.


There are many video downloaders available on the App Store, so feel free to choose whichever fits you best.
Video downloading apps are not supported by YouTube so they are occasionally removed from the App Store. In this case, get an alternate video downloader.
 Locate the app on your device and launch it.
 Find the Browser in your video downloader app, then enter youtube.com in the address bar to go to YouTube.
 Search YouTube for a video that you want to download and start playing it. If a menu pops up with the option to Download, select Download, name the file, then tap Save. This menu can also be pulled up by tapping and holding on the middle of the video pane.
 Your downloaded videos can be found and played in the Files section.

 If you can not, then read the song title so you can have an idea of what the song is about. Then try to figure out what would go with the subject of the song and at the same time sounds like the words the vocalist is screaming. You will not get it perfect, but you will have a better idea of the lyrics.;
, Even if you can't do it right it will still help you get a better idea. But if you do not know how to do this style of vocals correctly then DO NOT do this for too long because you can ruin your voice. If you insist on learning the correct technique, then there are many articles on the Internet on how to do this. Simply just Google search "metal screaming" or something of the sort.
 You must realise that a lot of the words that screaming vocalists are using will have an accent. Considering it is very hard to talk while screaming. An example is "the" may sound more like "thuh" and "attack" may sound more like "attyack" and "will" may sound more like "weell" and so on. A lot of the times screamers will scream one word for a long period of time making it very hard to understand. Try to follow along with the word as well as you can.
 This will help you understand how bands scream/growl certain words. Also, don't go straight into heavy bands and try to understand them, start off with lighter bands and get used to the sound, then go onto the heavier sound.

 When you are done praying, as you progress through your day and further on, look for signs that God has heard your prayers. Keep your heart open and look for ways in which he seeks to lead you on the appropriate path. You will know in your heart what is right.
 If you promised God that you would improve yourself or work harder for something, you should keep your promise. Work as hard as you can, honestly and with humility, and God will understand and be pleased.
 Don't just pray when you have a really big problem. God is not your band-aid. Pray all the time and show Him the respect that He deserves. Get in the habit and with time you will be great at praying.
 As you pray more, you will want to pray with others and bring others to understand how much they can gain from prayer. Bring them to God by helping them, honestly, humbly, and without judgement, and they too may become inspired to come to know Him as you have.

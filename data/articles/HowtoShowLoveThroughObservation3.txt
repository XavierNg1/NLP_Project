 Show up to your loved one’s major events. This might mean attending your kid’s sports games or recitals, going to your partner’s work functions, or being there for your family through a tragedy. You don’t need to say anything to show your support. Just showing up and being there is often enough to make someone feel loved and supported.


For example, attend your children’s plays and let them know how proud you are. Celebrate special moments with your family by going out to dinner or having a special meal at home.
 When it’s time to give them a gift, observe their likes and preferences, then act on them. Your loved one may mention they appreciate hand-made gifts or items from a certain store. Observe these preferences and perhaps even write them down so that you’re ready to give a heartfelt and meaningful gift when the time comes.


For example, if they mention they like blue flowers, surprise them with a bouquet of blue flowers one day.
 If your loved one loves a sports team or music artist, take note. Perhaps they make a passing comment about wanting to try a new restaurant in town or go ice skating. Observe these interests, then create an experience around them. Plan an activity doing something they mentioned in the past. Paying attention to these details can make them feel loved and care for.For example, buy the person tickets to a sports game or play you know they’ll love.
If they like adventurous experiences, take them rock climbing or paragliding.
These experiences may have deeper meaning because you initiated them.

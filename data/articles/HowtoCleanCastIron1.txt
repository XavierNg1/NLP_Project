 Seasoning cast iron creates a seal over the metal, preventing rust and creating a nonstick surface.









Some cast iron cookware comes pre-seasoned; read the packaging or ask a store clerk if you aren't sure about yours.
If you've had your cast iron cookware for awhile and don't know if it came seasoned, it's best to take the steps to season it, just in case. Read How to Season a Cast Iron Skillet to learn the best technique for seasoning your cookware.;
, Use a plastic scrubber to remove food. Be careful not to scrub too hard, so you don't remove the seasoning. Since the surface is nonstick, a light scrubbing should do.









Do not use soap on cast iron. It's abrasive to the iron's surface, and may remove the seasoning.
 Use a dry dishcloth, and make sure you don't miss any spots, especially on the inside of the cookware.









To be extra sure the cast iron is dry, place it on a hot burner and let it warm up for a few minutes, so any extra water will evaporate.
 Dab a paper towel in olive, grapeseed or canola oil and rub it over the cast iron. This seals the metal and makes sure no moisture causes the cast iron to rust.









If you use your cast iron cookware daily, this step is not necessary. Only coat the cast iron in oil if you're storing it for more than a few days.
 Take care not to stack a wet pot or pan on top of the cast iron.

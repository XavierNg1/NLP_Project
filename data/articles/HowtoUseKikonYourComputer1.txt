 Visit the Bluestacks website, where the download should start automatically. A box asking if you would like to save the file or cancel the download will pop up. Select the "Save File" option and wait until the download finishes, which should take roughly one to five minutes, depending on the speed of your computer.


Once the download has finished, open Bluestacks and wait until it finishes initializing. Set up the required settings until Bluestacks is ready for use. Be sure your computer can handle the file size of the application, as it is 262 MB.;
, In the search bar at the top of the home screen, type in "Kik". Click on the Instagram icon to open it in Google Play. Then, select the green "Install" button and wait until installation is complete, then open the app.
 When you launch Kik, you will be greeted with a screen with two options- to sign up or log in. To log in, type in your login credentials (these will be your email/username and password). Click the "Login" button at the bottom of the screen and wait until the verification page comes up. You will be required to either solve a CAPTCHA or a puzzle that will present you with an array of pictures. You will be given the name of an item and you must click the pictures that include that item (this verifies that you are not a bot). To sign up, type in the required information (username, email, password, name, etc.) and click the "Sign Up" button at the bottom of the screen. Pass the verification test to open up your account.
 Text your friends, use the web features, etc. Besides texting friends, you can use the web features such as Image, Video and GIF Search, Kik Points, Smiley Shop and more. When texting, you can send smileys, pictures, videos, stickers, memes and more. You can change your profile name and picture as well. Instead of touch screen, you use the mouse, but it is exactly like the mobile app.

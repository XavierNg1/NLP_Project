 Produce is a major source of food contamination and illness. This is because so many people handle the fruits and vegetables and they are exposed to many different environments. To help reduce the risk of contamination, wash your produce before you cut it. This is even true for items with a rind, such as lemons.
 Vegetables can be steamed in a matter of minutes in the microwave. Many frozen vegetables already come in a bag, in which the vegetables can be steamed directly.
 They work well incorporated into roasted meats, crock pot meals and soups. They can also be disguised in these applications to help picky eaters get their daily requirement. Omelets are a great way to get more vegetables at breakfast.
 Roasted vegetables have so much flavor and store in the fridge well for 3 to 5 days.
 A rice steamer helps take the guesswork out of steaming vegetables. Many steamers come with an instruction guide that will tell you how much water to add.
 This is a quick way to get your daily requirement and works well all meals. Raw fruits and vegetables are also great “fast food” because they can be eaten anywhere. Fruit goes well on top of desserts or as dessert itself and requires very little preparation.

Many groomers who are members of a professional association are licensed to practice and are up-to-date on their grooming training and techniques.
 A mobile cat groomer is a person who comes to your home to groom your cat, rather than you bringing your cat to the groomer. This is a good option if your cat is squeamish about going to the groomer and you do not have time to bring your cat to the grooming salon. Mobile cat groomers can cost more than a regular groomer but it may be worth it if it saves your cat the stress of leaving their home and is more convenient for you.Look online for mobile cat grooming services. Read reviews of the grooming service and check the prices before you book the service.
Some mobile cat grooming services serve cats only. If you are more comfortable with a feline-only service, make sure you check this detail when searching for a mobile cat groomer.

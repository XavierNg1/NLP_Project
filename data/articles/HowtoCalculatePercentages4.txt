 This is a very simple way to calculate a discounted price, but you must begin with an accurate percent off. Double check what your item is on sale for.
 The opposite of a percent is 100% minus the percent you are working with. If you want to buy a shirt that is 30% off, the opposite of this is 70%.
 To convert a percent into a decimal, multiply it by .01 or move the decimal two places to the left. In this example, 70% becomes .7

, If the shirt you want is $20, multiply 20 by .7. This comes to 14. This means the shirt is on sale for $14.

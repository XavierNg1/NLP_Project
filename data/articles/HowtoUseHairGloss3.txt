 If you opt for a demi-permanent hair gloss, make sure not to choose a color tone more than two shades lighter or darker than your current color. A more dramatic shift in color should be handled professionally. If you wish for a more dramatic change, book an appointment for a gloss treatment at your local salon., When applying a demi-permanent hair gloss, follow the instructions exactly to ensure that you apply it correctly. Set an alarm on your phone to make sure that you leave the gloss on your strands for the exact recommended time. Follow directions about shampooing or conditioning hair (which may vary between products), which can affect how the gloss treatment works on your hair., Once you've applied a demi-permanent gloss treatment, take note of how long the manufacturer says it will last. For instance, some treatments are specified for weekly use, while others may last through approximately 28 shampoos. Do not apply another gloss treatment until the duration of the current one has run out.At most, a hair gloss treatment will last six weeks.
 If your recent hair coloring experience has left you with hair that is brassy, badly highlighted, or overly yellow or orange in tone, use a gloss treatment to even out your color. A color-depositing gloss can correct problem tones in your hair and make your color look more natural. For the best results, book an appointment at a hair salon to ensure that no further coloring blunders occur.

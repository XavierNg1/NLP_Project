 Circular eyes seem to make the most sense being placed evenly apart from each other, as opposed to side-by-side.


How high or low the eyes sit on the face could help convey an emotion, so take that into consideration as you begin to draw.
You will also need to decide how big you want the eyes to be. How much space of the face they take up determines what other features you can add to it.



Use your compass to make these circles. Be sure to adjust the angle of your compass in order to make smaller circles.
Make the circles large enough to leave room for pupils inside.
Remember that you may need to hold both legs of the compass to avoid your angle widening as you draw the circles.
 Circular eyes are great for conveying a few different emotions, and the placement and size of the pupils lend showing to these emotions.


Surprise
Fear
Shock
Worry
Delight

, Keep in mind the emotion that you are trying to convey with your cartoon character's eyes.


The thickness of the iris helps your audience better understand how your cartoon character feels.
The color that you choose for the iris can also help to convey an emotion. Or, the color can simply demonstrate your unique creativity and the embodiment of what you envision your cartoon to look like.
 It is up to you how you shade in these characteristics, as it will depend on whether your character is male or female.


You might want to simply thicken the top line of the eye, with tapers at either end, to indicate eyelashes without drawing wispy lashes. Alternatively, you might want to add a number of eyelashes. Fewer numbers of eyelashes, or even no eyelashes, are common with circular cartoon eyes.Remember to draw your eyebrows in a shape that helps convey your character's emotion, as well as to indicate male or female. High arching eyebrows indicate surprise or fright, while lower, less arched eyebrows might indicate boredom or sadness.

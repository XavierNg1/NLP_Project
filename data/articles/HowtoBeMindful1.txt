 Mindfulness is the habit of consciously paying attention to what is going on around you. Being mindful takes practice. There are many ways that you can train your mind to increase your mindfulness every day. Think about all of the things you do on a daily basis: you eat, you breathe, you move, you speak. These are just a few examples. Imagine if you begin to be more aware of each part of your day. Think about what you might notice if you begin to truly pay attention to the small parts of your life. This is your first step towards being more mindful.;
, For example, pay attention to each step as you make your morning coffee. Then, be aware of how your senses react while drinking your coffee. Each day, try being mindful of a new part of your routine.


Try being mindful during your morning shower. Actually think about your senses. Does the warm water feel good? Do you like how your shower gel smells? Pay attention to the sensations involved in each part of your daily routine., Your mind actually works better in short bursts of activity, so keep your practice sessions short. Studies show that it is more productive and useful to break up lengthy stretches of concentration. You will actually be able to be more mindful if you keep your practice sessions short.For example, focus on picking out an outfit for work, but then let your mind wander while you go through the motions of actually getting dressed.

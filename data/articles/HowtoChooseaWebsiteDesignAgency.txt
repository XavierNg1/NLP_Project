 It is a great idea to check for the work portfolio, case studies and client testimonials of the web design companies you are considering. Are you familiar with any of the company names mentioned in their clients’ section? Google them and study their websites.


Do you like the website design that their website designers have created? Apart from the look and feel also see if the layout is user-friendly. You can also ask yourself if the design reflects the brand of the company.;
, You can further contact these companies by phone or email and inquire if they would be willing to send you references and testimonials from customers.


When they give, make sure to check them out. Call up the clients and check whether these testimonials are genuine.


But ultimately, the website design agency should provide you a single point of contact with whom you can discuss your requirements, seek updates and refer to for any clarification.






Ensure that the company provides you a dedicated resource so that there is no gap in communication and that your website design is completed within time and budget.
 As a rule, you should find a website design agency that reflects the requirement of your project. If your requirements are reasonably low, an agency with 5 to 10 employees should meet your purpose.
 In fact, the only constant in the online world is change. If the agency has been in the business for many years, it shows that it has managed well. The Internet has been the bane and boon for many companies – those who have survived are obviously running well and have on their payrolls website designers who are experts in their field.

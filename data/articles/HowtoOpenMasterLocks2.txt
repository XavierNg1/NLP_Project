 They will only work if you have a cheaper lock, or a very respectable tool set.
 Sometimes, a good jolt will knock the lock free. This won't work on all locks, but you may have some fun.









If the lock is on a wooden door, the odds are you will break the door before the lock.
 A drill should go right through the center of the lock where the mechanism is. This won't work on most master locks, and will likely disable the lock so it cannot even be opened with the proper key.
 The right power saw cuts through the lock itself.









The New York city fire department uses saws with an aluminum oxide blade. It is effective when you can access the lock with it.
Wear eye protection and cut through the body of the lock (not the shackle.)

, You can use this tool on the shackle or on an attached cable.









If the lock is attached to a cable, you may have better luck cutting the cable than the lock.
If you want to try to cut open the lock itself, cut the shackle. This will not work on most master locks, as they are made of case hardened steel.
 This only works if there is enough space to fit the pliers in. Similarly, for huge padlocks, a car jack may work to separate the lock.









Naturally these methods only work if there is enough space.
 You can actually open the lock with a high powered rifle, but you may be sprayed with metal fragments or ricocheting pieces.









This was proven by the Mythbusters.The Mythbusters tried a 9mm, a 357 magnum, a shotgun, and a M1 Garand rifle. The handguns did not work at all. The shotgun loosened it up
It is not safe to do this. Ricochets could kill you or someone else. The high powered rifle created shrapnel. Don't try it.

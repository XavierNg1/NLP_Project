Keep your voice gentle, soft and friendly.Try to keep your voice modulated so you’re not shouting or yelling. You can certainly exclaim if the conversation calls for it, but being too emphatic over the phone can come across the wrong way.
 Make sure the girl can understand what you’re saying. Slow down your speech so you’re talking at a normal pace (but not so slow that you sound awkward). Keep your voice relaxed and even., Even though she won’t be able to see you, she can still hear a smile in your voice when you talk. Keep your body relaxed and sit in a comfortable position when you talk on the phone. Smile when she says something funny or when you’re telling a story.Try recording your voice when you’re smiling and when you’re not smiling. Listen to the difference in your voice.

 Don't ever take the person for granted. If someone falls in love with you, you’ll need work to maintain that love. The best way to keep someone in love with you is to never, ever take the person for granted. Show the person that you appreciate him or her every day.For example, say thank you when your significant other does something nice for you. Make sure that the “thank you” is sincere and specific. For example, “Thank you for putting away the dishes and making coffee this morning! That made my morning so much easier! I really appreciate it.”

, Just because you’re both in love and your relationship seems stable and at its peak doesn’t mean you should stop putting in an effort. Continue to go on dates, buy each other flowers, and things like that. This will show your significant other that you still care and are still invested in the relationship.Most importantly: tell your significant other “I love you” every day.
 Don’t just do the same things you always do. Routines can be nice, relaxing, and even comforting but it’s important to break out every now and again and do something new and exciting together. This shows your significant other that there are still things to look forward to in the relationship and that their lives won’t stagnate by being with you. It can also help recapture some of the excitement associated with first falling in love.Do something daring like skydiving or rock climbing. Take up dance classes or learn to paint together.
Learn something new together, like furniture building, which can be used to fill your living space with things you create together.
Try introducing a board game night, which will give you the chance to have fun together and indulge your competitive sides.

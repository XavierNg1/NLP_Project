 Don't walk into a website blind as it could become very difficult without the correct knowledge of the website. Try to find a unique angle, although this is not essential;
, Editing, rendering, composing, it can be a big ask for some, getting to know it all before starting an account is always the right way to start.
 On some sites this is easier said then done such as YouTube, Vine and Vimeo. But for other websites such as blip, you must send a 5 minute trial of what kind of content you want to produce. Make it clean and presentable, then just watch your inbox.
 At the very beginning, you will have identified what kind of videos you want to produce, so deadlines are always key. If you state that you will release a video every week, that is what you have to stick to.
 You have to ambitious and a little bit mean on VINE, blip requires unique content that is well produced, Vimeo is smaller than most sites but requires the highest quality. The moral is always script, rehearse and know how to edit if needs be when creating the videos.
, If not your video could get buried under the rest of the videos that can almost be identical to your own video.
 The most important step, because if you're not having fun making the content, there is no point to being a producer. So always have a great time!

 Regardless of what level of emphasis the lender puts on your financial position, all of them are going to want to know about it. While certain lenders might ask for more or less, you should expect to provide the following:Your previous two years’ tax statements.
Bank statements.
A listing of assets and liabilities.
Your business’ profit and loss statements.
 While all of this information won’t apply to a construction project on a raw or minimally improved piece of land, you should present as many of the following as apply:Protective covenants, deed restrictions, and if you own the property, the deed to the land.
Income and expense statements, copies of old leases, age of the property, type of construction, and square footage of the unit(s). These would apply to a major renovation on an already existing property.
The credentials and the roles of the architect, builder, and construction manager.
Blueprints and insurance statements.
A budget and list of materials.
 The scheduled draws need to correspond to the work being done on the project. For example, the draws need to add up to 100% of the loan, and the amounts of the draw need to make sense in relation to the kind of work that’s being completed. Usually, the first and last draws are smaller than the middle draws. The first draws would cover permitting, closing costs, and the initial stages of construction, such as demolition and laying the foundation. A structure is built from the ground up and the outside in, so framing and roofing would cover the next draws, while interior electric, plumbing, drywall, and trim would come later.

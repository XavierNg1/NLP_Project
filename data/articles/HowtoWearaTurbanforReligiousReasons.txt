They shall wear linen turbans.” Then explain your own personal reasons for wearing a turban as well as the personal religious beliefs that cause you to wear it, Invite speakers such as lawyers or judges to explain to the assembly the importance of religious freedom and its protection by both the US Constitution and state law. It might even be a good idea to feature people from your own religion who wear different types of turbans, and have them explain the differences and when and why they wear each.

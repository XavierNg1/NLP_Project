 If you have mixed two or more gases, you will need to know how much of each gas is present. This is done on a percent basis. That allows you to know the ratios of the mixture regardless of how much gas is present overall.For example, if you had a mixture of 75% CO2 (carbon dioxide) and 25% H2O (water), those ratios would not change whether you have 1 L or 1,000 L of gas.
 By knowing the ratio of your gases, you can find the molar mass of your mixture. You will have to find the molar mass of each gas, and multiply it by its percent composition in the mixture. Then, add all of the products together to find the molar mass of the gas mixture.For example, you would find the molar mass of CO2 (44 g/mol) and multiply it by 0.75. Next you would find the molar mass of H2O (18 g/mol) and multiply it by 0.25. When you add these products together, 33 g/mol + 4.5 g/mol, you yield the molar mass of your mixture. In this case, the molar mass is 37.5 g/mol.
 Once the molar mass has been established for your mixture, finding the density of the gas is a simple calculation. Divide the molar mass by the standard volume (22.4 L/mol). Remember that you are assuming STP and one mole of gas.For example, the density of a mixture of 75% carbon dioxide and 25% water would be 37.5g/mol/22.4L/mol=1.67g/L{\displaystyle 37.5g/mol/22.4L/mol=1.67g/L}.

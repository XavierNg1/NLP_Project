 When constructing your issue statement, keep these things in mind:


You should describe the issue completely and thoroughly, but in no more than a few sentences. Issue statements that are too long can confuse the reader and the issue.
Each position statement issued by the Board should cover only one issue. If you have more than one issue upon which to release a statement, prepare separate statements for each one.
When the statement is concerning one of the organization's own policies or procedures, you should specify what the policy is, where the full text of the policy may be found, and why the Board is issuing an opinion on it.
 This should be done in one sentence. For example, "ABC Organization believes that destroying the woodlands south of town will displace a number of wildlife species and disrupt the balance of nature to the detriment of the town's environment." For situations in which the Board has been asked to support another's position on an issue, the position statement can be a single sentence that says whether it supports the position or not. For example, "ABC Organization supports the position offered by XYZ Corporation regarding the destruction of the woodlands south of town."

, You may choose to list the values in one or two sentences, or combine them with the position statement. An example of the value of respect for nature and the environment, combined with a position statement is, "Consistent with ABC Corporation's respect for nature and the environment, it believes that destroying the woodlands south of town will displace a number of wildlife species and disrupt the balance of nature to the detriment of the environment".
 Provide facts, statistics, and references for the position that the organization has taken. If there are facts and statistics that appear to support the opposite position, provide those as well, along with the organization's reason(s) for discounting them or interpreting them in a different way.

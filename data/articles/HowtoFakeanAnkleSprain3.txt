 You typically sprain an ankle when you roll it. This can happen while walking, running, jumping, falling, or playing a sport. Whenever story you make up, be sure to stick to it. Decide on the details of your story before telling it. Changing your story can lead to someone discovering that you are faking a sprained ankle.
 Since you are faking an injury, it may be difficult to remember that you are suppose to limp when you walk. You can place a rock, or something small but uncomfortable, in your shoe to help remind you that you should be walking with a limp.
 You should not trust anyone to keep your secret. Therefore, if you really want everyone to believe that your ankle is really sprained, you should refrain from telling anyone the truth., Before you fake a sprained ankle, you should do your research. Read about what a sprained ankle looks and feels like. Read about recovery times and treatments. The more you know about sprained ankles, the easier it will be to fake a sprained ankle.
 It takes most people between two and six weeks to recover from a sprained ankle if they follow their doctor’s medical advice. You should remember to continue the act for several weeks. It is also wise to gradually “recover” instead of instantly recovering.To “slowly recover”, gradually eliminate the wrap, brace, or crutches. Begin to put weight on your ankle again. Take one to two weeks to “fully recover.”

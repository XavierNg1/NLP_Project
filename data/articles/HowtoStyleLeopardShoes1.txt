 Leopard flats are versatile and suitable to just about any occasion, but leopard print heels may be considered too flashy for most work environments. As such, it would be best to save those for a date or special night out, and stick with a pair of flats instead., This means that you can pair it with just about any color. It goes especially well with fall colors, however, such as: brown, burgundy, gold, navy, olive green, and plum.Black, tan, and red also work great with leopard print.
 You can wear up to three different patterns with leopard print shoes, but make sure that the patterns are of a similar size and proportionate to one another.Having the patterns share a common color (such as black) will also keep your outfit from being too clash-y or busy.Polka dots, plaids, and stripes are all great matches for leopard print.Space the prints out and keep them separated with more neutrals. For example, you could wear leopard print shoes, solid-colored pants, and a plaid blouse. This will keep your outfit looking more balanced., Although not absolutely necessary, a matching leopard print belt or bangle could make your outfit more harmonious.Another idea would be to match an accessory to an element on your shoe.

 Some people like to keep their jewelry simple when wearing leopard print shoes, especially if the rest of their outfit is filled with patterns and prints.

Something with round shapes or elements would work especially well, because it would match the round leopard spots.

 For an extra surprise, have all the cuts completed on your paper. Give yourself a good bit of practice before you begin showcasing your trick.


In the preparation process, do not unfold the paper.
 Place your pre-cut paper in either a manila envelope or a laminating template. You could really use anything, but be sure it is secure.
 A great way of introducing the trick is for the audience to see the paper before it's cut. Part of the disbelief will be your audience creating doubt when they see a regular piece or paper or an index card.
 Decide what type of audience you want to try the trick out on. Practice on friends and family before you incorporate the trick into your act.


Try bring up a bunch of hypothetical situations and include passing through paper as one. This could be a good way to introduce the trick. Careful not to let the conversation get side-tracked, or else your trick won't be relevant in conversation.
 See how many people can fit into the hole. The index card technique will not yield as many people as the standard sized page.


Another way you could impress your audience is by following your standard sized page with the index card.
 Most performers of illusions and magic can offer comic relief throughout their set. You could develop a persona that uses certain jokes that you wouldn't normally say.

 Look for Memopal from the Start menu under All Programs, and click on it.;
, You will be taken to the Dashboard view.
 You’ll find this on the bottom layer of the Dashboard. Clicking on the “Restore” button will download the online files to your computer.
 A small window will open containing the folders on Memopal linked with this computer. Navigate through the folders by double-clicking on them. The folder directory follows the exact path as how it was uploaded from the source computer. Stop when you have reached the folder you want to restore.
 Deleted files are only flagged in Memopal and not permanently removed when you remove them from your devices. If you want to include the deleted files in the restoration, or if you want to see the deleted files and folders in your navigation, tick on the checkbox for “Show deleted files.” Otherwise, you may skip this step.
 Click on the “Restore” button on the small window. Set the destination folder on your local computer where the files to be restored will be placed, and click “Okay.”


During restoration, the selected folder from Memopal will be downloaded to the destination folder on your local computer. The restore progress will be displayed as the files are downloaded to your computer.
 Go to the destination folder on your computer and see the files you’ve just restored and downloaded.

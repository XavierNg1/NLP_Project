 You can't really penetrate the ice until you get all of the snow off the area. This will only take about 10-15 minutes depending on the size of your driveway. If someone is snow blowing or your kids are playing near the driveway ask them to go inside, go do it somewhere else, or help you.;
, The kind you want can be found at most hardware stores. If all else fails you can just use table salt. Now spread the salt around all over the area. If you have some extra salt you might want to go over it twice to make sure you got everything.
 Go inside and get some hot chocolate or get a blanket. Whatever you want to do for the next 2-3 hours. After that has passed, go back outside and shovel of the rest of the ice! It won't be hard because the salt melted the ice and you just need to shovel a little. And you have a great looking driveway!

, Otherwise, if it gets cold again, it will freeze and you will have substantially more ice than you did before.

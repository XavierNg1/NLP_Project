 Recently hatched mantises will eat small fruit flies or other mantises. Small and medium-sized ones eat crickets, grasshoppers, and other small insects or bugs. Adults can eat many things, including flies and other bugs, butterflies, and even tiny lizards. You may also be able to buy them food.
 When they don't move for a long time and their skin takes on a weird color, it means that they're going to molt, or shed their exoskeleton. When this happens, don't touch or play with them, try not to annoy them, and realize that they won't eat. Once your mantis has finished molting, you can remove its old exoskeleton from its cage and return to life as normal.
 Keep the cage neat and clean. Remove any dead or wilted plants from the cage and replace them with new, fresh ones. Mantises eat live food and can be messy, so clean away remnants of meals, poop, and anything else that might be dirtying the cage. Don't allow anything foreign or potentially harmful into the container.
 When it's an adult and big enough to fend for itself, consider releasing your praying mantis back into the wild. If you decide to do this, take it back to where you found it, if possible. Then remove the lid from its container and turn the container on its side, and simply wait for your mantis to leave on its own.

 Most celebrities use social media platforms like Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook. You are much more likely to get a response using one of these methods. Reply to a post, send a direct message, or comment on a picture.Check their social media pages to see if they interact with their fans. Try to use the same methods as fans that have gotten a response. If you notice that the person replies more on Twitter than on Facebook, then Twitter is the best route to go.
 Some people may prefer emails instead of receiving letters in the mail. Check their website to see if they have an email address listed for fan mail. Your email should include the same information as a handwritten letter, but it should be shorter.Limit your emails to 4 or 5 sentences.
 There are many ways that you can contact people these days. It is tempting to use all of the methods to increase your chances of getting a response. However, this will actually make you look like a weirdo.


If you send an email, do not send a handwritten letter as well.
Do not send a direct message on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook at the same time.
If you contact a person too much, you decrease your chances of getting a reply.

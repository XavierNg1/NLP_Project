 You can sow the seeds in peat pots with several seeds per cell to ensure that at least one will germinate into a seedling.


To speed up germination, you can pre-soak your seeds in water overnight.Cover with about one-inch of potting soil but do not pat down with your fingers after sowing the seeds. Celery seeds need a lot of light to germinate. Water the peat pots to moisten the soil after planting your seeds.
Place your seeds in a warm place so that the soil stays between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit until the seeds germinate. This should take two to three weeks.
After germination, place the seedlings in a cooler indoor location so that the soil is between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Carefully thin the seedlings so that there is only one per cell after they germinate.
 Make sure that it is not too cold outside. Celery can handle a light frost, but temperatures below 55 °F (13 °C) in the day and 40 °F (4 °C) at night for longer than one week can harm your celery plants.
 You only need to dig holes slightly deeper than the depth of the peat pots cells. Pat the sides of the cells to get the seedlings to slip out without harming the roots.
 Only cover up to the first level of foliage and pat the planting area around the seedlings lightly with your hands for support.
 Celery requires constant moisture, so do not allow the soil to dry out at any time. If celery does not get enough water, the stalks will be stringy and bitter. Be sure to water several times per week and increase your watering routine during particularly warm or dry spells.
 To keep the soil cool and moist, add a few inches of mulch made of leaves, grass, hay, or other plant material on top of the soil. Doing so also helps reduce the ability of weeds to infiltrate the planting area.

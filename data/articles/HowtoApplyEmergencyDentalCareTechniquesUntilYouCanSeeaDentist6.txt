 If a crown is loose, see a dentist immediately. It may indicate that cavities are present under it. If not attended right away, tooth might start hurting. You may even lose the tooth.
 Occasionally, the crown comes off. This leaves the tooth unprotected, and often sensitive.


You can temporarily remedy this problem by using temporary dental cement found at the drugstore, and carefully re-cementing the crown. #* It may not be necessary, if your can get to the dentist within a day or two. Never wait more that a few days to get a crown re-cemented. Teeth move and shift very quickly without the crown in place. Sometimes it is not possible to reuse the crown if the teeth have shifted significantly, requiring your dentist to have to make a new crown.

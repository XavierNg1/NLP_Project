 When you place a lacrosse ball into the net of your stick, it should not sink completely below the uppermost plastic rim of the pocket. If the pocket is too deep, it will be unfairly easy for you to keep the ball in your net, and your stick will violate game regulations. In a game situation, a referee will not hesitate to penalize you for a non-regulation pocket—so make a habit of checking your stick before you play. If your pocket is too deep, you can untie and adjust the strings.For men's lacrosse: Make sure that the pocket is not too shallow. When a ball is in your pocket and you hold the stick perfectly horizontally, the ball should not be visible above the rim of the head. If the pocket is too shallow, you will not be able to control the ball when you cradle, pass, and shoot.
For women's lacrosse: As opposed to men's lacrosse, no pocket is allowed. The pocket of the ball must protrude from the top of the wooden or plastic rim when you hold the stick horizontally. This shallow pocket rule makes it easier for other players to dislodge the ball from your control—and it also means that you will need to cradle differently to keep your ball in the stick.;
, Untie the knots that protrude from the head where it meets the shaft. Pull the strings slightly further from the head of the stick, then retie the knots so that the pocket is shallower.


Ask a coach or a teammate for help.
Be aware that you may need to adjust and readjust the pocket several times until it feels right.

 Lay the cardboard or poster board on a flat surface. Sketch out individual body parts for the marionette. The puppet will need two separate arms, two separate legs and a torso section with the head attached.;
, Decorate the sketched puppet with markers, crayons or paint, and cut out the pieces.
 Assemble the puppet face-up on a flat surface. Lay the torso piece down first, then arrange the arms and legs on the marionette so that a section of each overlaps with the torso piece.
 Push a brass brad through each joint in the puppet; punch holes in the paper if it is too thick to be pierced by the brad alone. The joints should remain loose and flexible enough for the limbs to move easily.
 Lay down two chopsticks or pencils to form a cross. Tape the sticks together where they intersect.
 Thread a needle with fishing line. Piercing a hole through the cardboard just above the knees and the wrists, knot the line and draw the fishing line through. Knot and cut the line after making each attachment. The length of fishing line extending from each section needs to be long enough to reach the sticks, which should be at least 6 inches (15.2Â cm) above the shoulders (longer if the head is large).
 Knot the fishing line extending from the puppet's shoulders to the center of the cross. Knot each of the four strings connected to the puppet's limbs to an individual arm of the cross. Dot school glue on each knot to keep it from untying.

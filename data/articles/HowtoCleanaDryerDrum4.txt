 Start by running the dryer for 10 minutes. This can help loosen the ink and make it easier to remove. You can alternatively use a hairdryer to heat up the specific spot which is being affected. This may be easier and more efficient to do.
 Unplug the dryer to prevent accidents. The plug is usually located behind the machine. Test it to be sure that you have unplugged it correctly.


Be sure to go quickly so that the drum is still warm when you're cleaning it.
 Buy some isopropyl alcohol from your local drugstore and apply the alcohol to a white, clean rag.


You'll want to be sure that you get plenty of ventilation while you're working with the isopropyl alcohol.
 Work quickly to wipe off the ink using the alcohol soaked rag. Change rags frequently to keep from spreading the ink even more.
 Once you've removed as much of the product as you can, mix a bucket with soapy water. Use this water and a clean cloth to wipe down the inside of the drum.
 With the dryer rinsed out, run a load of old towels through a cycle in the dryer to remove any ink which might still remain.

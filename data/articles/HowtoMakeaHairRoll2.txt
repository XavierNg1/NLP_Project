 Before you put hair in bottom rolls, make sure to use a generous amount of styling mousse or cream. This will help the hair to stay put in the rolls. Apply the styling mousse evenly throughout your hair.
 Make a central part down the middle of your hair. Then create three sections of hair: one in the back, and two in the front. Take one section of hair and tuck away the other sections so they don’t get in your way.
 Take one section of hair and twist it between your fingers until it is twisted around in the same way that a rope is twisted. Make sure that the twist is neat looking, with no flyaways. Then coil the twist by holding the base of the hair against your head with one hand and circling your twisted hair around it with the other to create a roll. Pin this roll behind your ear. Make sure that you pin in such as way that the hair doesn’t uncoil.
 Take your other two sections of hair and twist and coil. Pin the sections next to each other This should create a neat updo, with the hair rolls blending in together so that you cannot easily see that the roll is made of three separate sections. The hair rolls should look like one roll in a line over the nape of the neck.
 Spray the hair rolls liberally with hairspray. This should reinforce the style so that it stays put. You can also add additional pins if you’re worried that the hair will fall down.

 When you are trying out your solutions, having other people support you can help you solve your problem and ease your anxiety. Friends and family can help with resources, encourage you, and help you keep your focus on solutions.For example, you might tell your best friend, “I’m trying not to get anxious about this situation. Could you help me by going with me?”
Or, you might ask your co-worker, “This big project has me a little nervous. Would you mind going over the timeline with me?”

, When you try a solution, you should evaluate whether it’s working or not. Evaluating your outcomes and immediately moving on to another solution if you need to will keep you acting instead of allowing negative thoughts to creep in.

If it doesn’t seem that a solution is working, shift gears and try the next solution. For example, if you need to get invitations printed quickly and your first choice can’t do it, move on to your second choice.
 Your first solution may not work, but don’t let this discourage you. Move on to your next solution if you need to. Encourage yourself to keep trying so that you stay focused on the solutions and keep anxiety-producing thoughts out of your mind.


Remind yourself that trying a solution is better than not trying anything at all. For example, you might say to yourself, “That solution didn’t work, but trying is better than doing nothing.”
When you find a solution that does work, congratulate yourself afterwards. For example, if you get your mom’s tablet fixed, you might treat yourself to movie and some ice cream.

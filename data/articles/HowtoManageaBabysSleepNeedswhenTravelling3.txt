 Once at your destination, if awake, allow time for your baby to familiarise themselves with the new surroundings. Do not allow another (especially unfamiliar) family member to put them to bed on her first night â€“ no matter how tempting that might be.
 If you are travelling with your partner, it is a good idea to organize yourselves into shifts to deal with the night, or very early morning waking, which is so common when you change time zones.

 The name of an AKC registered dog may only be changed if the dog was born in the United States. Find out where you dog was born if you are not certain.
 In cases where the dog was first registered by the litter owner or breeder, the litter owner’s written consent is required. Request a letter from your litter owner or breeder in order to move forward with a name change.
 The name of an AKC registered dog can only be changed if her or she has not already produced or sired an AKC registered litter of puppies.
 Another restriction of changing the name of an AKC registered dog is the receipt of AKC awards. You may only change the name of your dog if he or she has never received an award at an AKC event.
 Any name change must comply with all AKC requirements. This means your new name must be 36 characters or less, avoid profanity, avoid breed names and gender descriptors, and stay away from terms like “champion” and “champ.”

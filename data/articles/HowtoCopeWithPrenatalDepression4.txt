 Writing about your emotions, your daily activities, your hopes and fears, your frustrations, your random ideas, and anything else that strikes your fancy can help you manage your prenatal depression.


Experts believe that writing allows you to address your experiences and work through your depression slowly but effectively, confronting the matters that are causing your mental roadblock and giving you the opportunity to put words to your thoughts without having to speak them aloud or worry about grammar, structure, or judgment.
Write at least three times each week for at least two months before deciding whether to continue. Healing from depression takes time, and journaling is not an immediate cure.
Consider keeping a diary of notes to your unborn child, letting him or her know how you feel each day, what your thoughts are regarding your baby’s future, your feelings about becoming a mother, and the honest ups and downs of your pregnancy experience. This can help you work through potential hang-ups you may have about your pregnancy and may help you bond you’re your baby. After your recovery, you can throw the diary away or you can decide to keep it to share with him or her someday.
 Physical activity helps your body produce serotonin and other chemicals that improve your mood and regulate your emotions, which can have positive effects on your mood that last for hours. Try taking a walk, swimming a few laps, or signing up for prenatal yoga for a long-lasting boost in energy and mood.
 Starting a new activity may seem daunting, but making new friends, trying new things, and learning a new skill can help build your support network and ease feelings of isolation or inadequacy. Getting involved can naturally ease symptoms of depression and help you cope with your emotions, preventing your depression from worsening and even potentially pulling you through your prenatal depression entirely.

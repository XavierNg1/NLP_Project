 The quickest way to determine the least or greatest number is to compare their whole numbers. If one number has a larger whole number than the others, it is automatically the greatest number. If one number has a smaller whole number than the others, it is automatically the least number.

For example, if you are comparing the numbers 12.45, 12.457, and 11.47, compare the whole numbers: 12, 12, and 11. Since 11 is less than 12, you know that 11.47 is going to be the smallest, or least, number.
;
, The table should have one row for each number, and a column for each digit in the numbers. You should also add a row to include the decimal point.Label the place values above the table.

For example, since you are comparing 12.45 and 12.457, you will make a table with two rows and six columns--one column for each place value in the longest number, plus a column for the decimal point.

From left to right, the columns would be labeled tens, ones, decimal, tenths, hundredths, thousandths.
 Make sure the decimal points line up. If the numbers are different lengths, fill in zeros for any open columns.For example, since 12.45 has four digits, and 12.457 has five digits, you will need to add a 0 in the thousandths place for 12.45.
 If either number has a larger digit in the tenths column, it is the larger number. If the numbers have the same digit in the tenths column, you need to move on to compare the hundredths column.

For example, 12.45 and 12.457 both have a 4 in the tenths place, so you cannot tell yet which is greater.
 Again, compare the digits in this place value. If either number has a larger digit here, it is the larger number. If not, you need to move on to the thousandths column.

For example, 12.45 and 12.457 both have a 5 in the hundredths place, so you cannot tell yet which is greater.
 Keep comparing the digits in the columns of your table, until you find a number that has a larger digit. This will be the largest number.For example, 12.45 has a 0 in the thousandths place, and 12.457 has a 7 in the thousandths place. Thus, 12.457 is greater than 12.45.
 The smallest number should come first in your list, and the largest number should come last. The other numbers should be listed in between in ascending order.

For example, the numbers listed from least to greatest are 11.47, 12.45, 12.457. You can also write them using the less than symbol: 11.47 < 12.45 < 12.457.

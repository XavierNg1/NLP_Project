 You'll need one large cauldron and one smaller cauldron or punch bowl that fits inside the larger one. Put a block of dry ice or chunks of dry ice in the bottom of the large cauldron. Add water to the dry ice until it starts to smoke. Set the smaller cauldron or punch bowl on top of the dry ice so you can serve the witches' brew out of it.Wear heavy duty gloves or use tongs to handle the dry ice since it can burn your skin.
 Carefully pour 2 cups (470 ml) of boiling water into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Open one 6-ounce (170 g) package of lime gelatin and add it to the boiling water. Whisk the gelatin and water until the gelatin dissolves.The lime gelatin will give your cocktails a slightly green color. If you want a different colored cocktail, consider using strawberry for red or grape for purple.
 Once the gelatin is dissolved, pour 3 cups (705 ml) of chilled pineapple juice into the gelatin mixture. Whisk it to combine the liquids. Pour this mixture into the smaller cauldron or punch bowl that you plan to serve the cocktails from.To keep the mixture from warming your cocktail, let it come to room temperature before continuing.
If you'd like a less sweet cocktail, you could use apple juice instead of the pineapple juice.
 Chill one 2-liter bottle of lemon-lime soda or ginger ale. Pour this into your gelatin and juice mixture. Give it a little stir and add 2 cups (470 ml) of chilled vodka, if you'd like to make the cocktails alcoholic. Let your guests ladle the witches' brew cocktail into their glasses.You could also leave the vodka out of the punch bowl and have your guests add it to their own glasses if they'd like. This way, you can still serve non-alcoholic cocktails.

 Insect pins are a specific variety of push-pin, made of tempered steel and are typically 3.5 centimeters (1.4 inches) in length. They are quite thin, to avoid damaging the insect’s body. Any type of foam should work to mount insects, as long as the foam is dense (so that the pinned insect won’t fall over).Both insect pins and mounting foam (or cork) can be purchased at a hobby store or through a biological supply company, such as BioQuip. Pins and mounting foam can also be purchased through online retailers, including Amazon.
It’s also common to mount insects on cork instead of foam.
 It’s most effective to preserve hard-bodied insects—including beetles and cockroaches—by pinning. Stick the pin through the thorax (middle section) of your dead insect. Insert the pin until it is roughly 2/3 through the insect’s body; the idea is to be able to pick up and handle the pin without touching the insect.If you’re pinning a beetle, insert the pin through the middle of the right wing sheath., Determine the insect’s genus and species, and print these clearly on a slip of paper. Also note the location and date on which the insect was found, and the individual who collected the specimen. Some collectors also note the environment from which the insect was collected: feeding on a leaf, found under a log, etc., Simply press the pin down into the foam, until it is about half an inch (1.3 centimeters) deep. Be careful not to disturb or break the insect’s body in this process.Then, using tape or small push-pins, affix the label just below the pinned insect.

If you plan to develop a large collection of pinned insects, you may wish to start with a large piece of foam or cork, so the collection has room to expand.
Protect the pinned insects by storing it in a cabinet or a set of drawers, or even by placing the pinned insects in a wooden cigar box.

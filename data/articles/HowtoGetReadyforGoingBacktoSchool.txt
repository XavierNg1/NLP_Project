, Instead of buying things all willy-nilly, make a plan -- see what fits and is still fashionable from last year. Look for "holes" in the wardrobe (in other words, what's missing), and shop accordingly. You'll save time, money and stress.
 To keep the first week of school stress-free, plan out five cute outfits. Make sure they're comfortable and you like them.

 What worked last year (in terms of homework and studying) may not be a perfect fit this year. Be open to new ideas and be willing to make adjustments as necessary.
 Many students find it helpful to have a desk stuffed with supplies in a quiet place. That way, they have somewhere peaceful and well-stocked to work. Set up study station long before school starts.
 If you're a student about to enter into first-year french, consider buying a phrasebook or dictionary and doing a little studying before the course actually begins. You may also find it helpful to brush up on previous knowledge that may help you in this year's classes.
 It's important that a student has a healthy and tasty lunch packed when they go to school. That way, they won't eat cafeteria food or things from vending machines; those are high in calories and low in nutrition. If you're a student, work out a healthy meal plan for yourself, or if you're the parent, make sure you pack nutritious things for your children.
 It only takes a few minutes to ensure that things are running smoothly and to make any necessary adjustments. It doesn’t have to be anything as formal as a “family conference,” rather, it can be as simple as a five-minute conversation with your student and a quick room inspection.

 If you are using a public toilet, you may wish to squat above the toilet, without actually resting on the seat. Otherwise you can use a seat-liner or tear several strips of toilet paper, lay them on the toilet seat, and sit.


Make sure you have pulled down your pants and underwear or lifted your dress or skirt before sitting down.
Squeeze the muscles around your urethra (the opening through which urine exits your body). You only have to do this for a moment, but squeeze tight so you don't start peeing as soon as you sit down.;
, Hold the string against your thigh, and it should be out of the way when you pee.You may also want to reach behind and pull the string back, toward your anus. Only do this if you aren't also going to defecate, and be sure the string doesn't actually touch your anus., Keep your hand and the string out of the way as you urinate.
 Continue to hold the string off to the side, using your free hand to tear off some toilet paper and wipe yourself from front to back.


Flush, pull up your pants, and remember to wash your hands.

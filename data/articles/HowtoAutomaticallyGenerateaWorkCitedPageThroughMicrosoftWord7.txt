 Then, you click Word 2007.;
, You look for the “References” tab and click it. In the “Citations & Bibliography” group (this is the third box from your left), click the arrow next to “Style”.
 For example: in a professional writing class for nurses, the instructor may want you to use APA style for sources and citations.
 You have two choices:


Clicking “Add New Source” will allow you to add the source information.
Clicking “Add New Placeholder” will allow you to create a citation and fill in the source information later. In Source Manager, a question mark will appear next to the placeholder sources.
 By selecting the “Type of source”, start to fill in the source information. Your source might be a book, magazine, journal, website or others. Remember, not all of the types of sources are on Word 2007 but it provides a majority of frequently used ones.


Also, if you want to add more information about a source, you can click the “Show All Bibliography Fields” check box.
You can also add sources by clicking the “Manage Sources” command. In the “Manage Sources” command, you can also preview your citation entry and bibliography entry. Note: if you open a new document that does not contain citations, all of the sources that you used in previous documents will show under the “Master List”. Just select the sources you are using and copy them onto the “Current List”.
 Your citation should show.
 This will be on the “References” tab. In the “Citations & Bibliography”, you will select “Bibliography”. There are two pre-designed bibliography formats. Click the one you want and it will have the sources listed automatically. If it needs to have hanging indentations, you will need to edit it. You will possibly need to edit the font, font size, and line spacing according to what is necessary.

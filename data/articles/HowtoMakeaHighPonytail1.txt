 Just like in the first ponytail, brush your hair so it is going the direction you want it to go, towards the crown of your head. That includes flipping your head over so that you are brushing up towards the ponytail in the back. This technique helps getting your hair going where it needs to go., Use a teasing brush to comb gently back towards your roots while holding a section of your hair up. The teasing will give your hair volume.
 In this style, you're actually putting a ponytail on top of a ponytail. Pull the hair just from your ears back into a small ponytail at the crown of your head. Use your hands to smooth it out, and secure it with a hair tie.
 Hold the hair in the ponytail up. Use a teasing comb to lightly comb back towards the holder. This process will help create volume.
 Leaving the first ponytail in place, pull the other hair up around the first ponytail. Smooth out the hair with your hands, or if you need to, a brush. Secure it around the first ponytail with another holder.
 Lightly spray the hair in place with hairspray.You can also use a dedicated toothbrush with hairspray on it to smooth out any loose hairs.

 Set the oven to 220ºC (425ºF/ gas mark 7).
 Place the potatoes into a saucepan of water. Cover with the pan lid and bring to a simmer.


Allow them to cook for roughly 7-10 minutes. As we are par boiling, only their outer layer should be soft.
 While the potatoes are cooking, spoon the lard or fat into the roasting tray, place it into the upper part of the preheated oven and let it heat up.


The fat must be very hot in order for the potatoes not to stick to the pan. They'll also turn out a lot crispier and tastier.
 Remove the pan from the heat and take it to the sink.


Using a towel to protect your hands, carefully drain the water from the pot, using the lid to keep the potatoes in place.
Then with the lid still on, shake the potatoes in order to 'roughen them up'. This will help to create a crunchier coat. Finally, remove the lid and season with salt and pepper.
 With great care, remove the hot tray from the oven. Carefully spoon each potato into the hot, sizzling fat. Be very careful not to burn yourself! Return the roasting tray to the oven and bake the potatoes for about 45 minutes.


Halfway through the cooking time, turn them over to ensure they are cooking evenly. Then place back in the oven to crisp on the other side. When they are golden brown, remove them from the oven.
 Your extra crispy potatoes are now ready to serve. Sprinkle them with a little more salt and pepper before serving. They make a wonderful accompaniment to a Sunday roast, a chicken dinner or nicely cooked rib-eye steak. They are as versatile as they are tasty. Enjoy!

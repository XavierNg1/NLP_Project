 If a family member has recently told you that they are trans, the best thing to do is not rush them. They have most likely had a very hard time speaking up about being trans, so don't ask them a lot of questions at once. Let them talk as much as they would like and then wait until they bring it up again before asking more questions.;
, The more knowledge you have of the situation the more you can help your family member.
 As difficult as it may be for you, it will be twice as hard for your family member. It will definitely help them out if you don't go telling people about their transition. Let them tell who they want when they are ready.
 In time, your family member may feel they would like to be referred to as other pronouns. Try to respect their wishes and do the best you can. If you make a mistake, don't keep apologizing; just move on and forget it happened.
 Also in time, your family member may choose to change their name. Don't be mad that they are changing their given name. It will be hard adjusting to the new name but it will become easier with time.
 It may seem like they are a whole new person but in fact they're not. They are just who they are meant to be and will surely be happier.

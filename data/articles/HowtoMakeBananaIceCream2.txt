 Peel the bananas. Take each banana and cut it into small, 1/2 inch sized pieces. Line a freezer safe pan with parchment paper. Place the slices side by side in a single layer on the parchment paper. Freeze for 2 hours.


You can also use wax paper., Once the bananas have been frozen for 2 hours, put them in the food processor. Pulse the bananas for a few seconds. Check the consistency. They need to be a course crumb texture. Continue to pulse for a few seconds at a time until they reach this consistency.


Make sure you use the chopping blade in your food processor.
 Pour the vanilla and chosen milk into the processor. Process the ingredients together until they are smooth and the consistency of creamy soft serve ice cream.


You may have to spatula off the sides of the processor to get the ingredients to fully mix together.
 Pour the mixture into a freezer safe container. Use the spatula to scrap the sides of the bowl. Cover the container and freeze for 2-4 hours, then enjoy.


The time in the freezer will depend on the consistency you want out of your ice cream. Check it after two hours to see if it is creamy and hard enough for you.

 Begin by bringing 2 cups (16 oz) of water to a boil over a high heat. Once the water begins to boil, close the steamer to allow its internal temperature to build.


"Closing the steamer" here meaning put the lid on the top pan, which is resting on the pan filled with water. This is similar to a double boiler or bain marie. 


, After the steamer has been covered for a minute, add your chosen vegetables, prepared and ready to go. Make sure to keep them in separate groups; this will make them easier to remove when they finish, as each one cooks at a different time.
 The green ones should be closer to done than the others. If they seem ready, which they should just about be, the steaming is done!


, If you are working with cauliflower, carrots, potatoes, or corn, you may need more time. Whenever your vegetables are done, place them onto a tray lined with paper towels to drain.


Of course, the best test is a taste test. Your vegetables should be firm, but tender. 


, Transfer all your steamed vegetables onto a serving platter. Season to taste with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Your vegetables are now ready to serve.


They go wonderfully with any meat, can be served with a cheese or herb sauce, or even just as they are. Since steaming is so healthy, it is best not to load them up with extra fixings -- they are delicious and nutritious as is!

 Warmth and moisture tends to make the adhesive in many bandages more pliable.One convenient way to soak the sticky area in warm water is to simply take a bath or shower. The adhesive may come off on its own, or may need a little gentle scrubbing from a washrag or mild abrasive pad.


If you don't have time to take a bath or shower, just fill a bowl or pan with warm water and soak the affected area. This works best if you can let the adhesive soak for a long time. Try this remedy while you're reading or watching television.;
, A few drops of olive, canola, vegetable, coconut, or sunflower oil can help remove adhesive from the skin. Some adhesives dissolve in oil. Others lose their grip when the oil finds its way between the glue and the skin.For best results, work the oil into the affected area with a little gentle action from a soft rag or cotton swab. You don't need much â€” your goal is to lightly coat the skin, not drench it. Let the oil soak for a moment or two before rubbing gently with a soft towel or cotton ball. Repeat as needed to get all the adhesive off.
 Cover the ice with a paper towel to prevent it from sticking to skin and leave in place for five minutes. The ice will make the adhesive brittle, which may cause it to release.

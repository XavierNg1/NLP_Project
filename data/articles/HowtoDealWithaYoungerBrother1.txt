 Do you push him when you pass him in the hall? Do you lock him out of the bathroom just to annoy him? Do you take his things without asking? It can be easy to pick on a little brother without even thinking about it, especially since he's littler than you and can't really do anything about it. Start noticing how you treat him throughout the day.


In some cases, it can feel like it is your brother's fault that you pick on him. He annoys you, so you pick on him, so he annoys you more-- it's a cycle that won't stop until you try something different.;
, It can be hard to be a younger brother. He probably thinks you are cool and wants to be with you, but isn't mature enough to play the kind of games you like or hang out with you like your friends do. He might be starting fights or bothering you because he wants attention.


When you imagine how someone else is feeling, it is called empathy. Empathy helps you decide how to act toward someone by imagining how they feel, and then responding with what would feel most helpful or reassuring to you if you were in their place.
 You've probably heard this saying, called the "Golden Rule," and it is a great way to treat your brother. Just because he's your younger brother doesn't mean he doesn't deserve regular respect!


Treat him how you want him to treat you. Don't yell at him, take his things without asking, or tattle on him. He may not treat you the same, but if you're respectful and kind to him, you can't be blamed for him starting a fight.
 Never start a conversation screaming. It hurts his feelings when you snap at him, and will make him snap right back.


Try saying "Good morning!" in a cheery voice every day. It sets the right tone for the rest of the day.

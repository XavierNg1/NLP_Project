 If you suspect that your cat has keratitis, take him to the vet immediately. Leaving keratitis untreated can lead to severe eye damage which may result in blindness.


Common symptoms of keratitis include swollen or irritated eyes, discharge from the eye, and discoloration of the eye.
Though eye irritation might be due to multiple conditions, or caused by a variety of triggers, any eye problems in your cat should be seen by a vet.;
, When you take your cat to the vet, the vet will perform a thorough physical exam. This usually includes checking the cat's temperature to rule out fever, listening to the chest, and looking at the tongue. Then the vet will check for complications in the eye, such as a corneal ulcer or glaucoma.


Your vet will check to see if the cat has a more generalized respiratory infection, such as with herpes virus.
To check for an ulcer, the vet puts drops of a special dye into the eye. The orange dye stains ulcers bright green. This is important to check since the treatment for keratitis can involve steroid drops, and steroids can make corneal ulcers worse.
If the vet suspects glaucoma, then she will use a tonometer to check the pressure within the eye. This condition can mimic keratitis, but the treatment is different for glaucoma than keratitis.
 To rule any other reasons for keratitis, the vet may select other tests to run. This may include wiping a sterile swab over the surface of the eye and then sending the culture to check if there is a bacterial colony present which needs treatment.The vet may also run blood tests, checking the pet's general health and factors which may suppress the immune system, such as FeLV and FIV. These can prevent the natural defense mechanisms of the eye from reducing inflammation.

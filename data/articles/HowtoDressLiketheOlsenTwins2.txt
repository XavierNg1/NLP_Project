 Over-sized tees are a must, though avoid anything that falls below your knees.;
, Bomber jackets are great for the rock look and men's hoodies and jackets are very cozy. Vest tops are great with cardigans, layered with a loose fitting hoodie.
 Ripped jeans, flared jeans, tight jeans, or rolled up jeans are suitable.
 Denim skirts and shorts are a must, but do not wear them with leggings! Checkered shirts are coming into fashion as being used as sarongs/skirts; if you've got one, wrap it around your waist!

, Gladiator sandals are recently trendy for the twins or sandals with gold/brass studs on. Over-sized heeled boots are also very nice. Flip flops are acceptable, but not very often. Dolly shoes are very nice, great for a casual Mary-Kate and Ashley look. Leopard print shoes are also very fashionable

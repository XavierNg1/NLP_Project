 “Adult” milkshakes, containing alcohol or caffeine, make delicious treats. These quick and easy recipes feature a blended shake of Vietnamese iced coffee and coconut ice cream, along with the more “adult” salted caramel, vanilla and rum concoction.

If you’re looking for a sweeter way to get your daily dose of caffeine, or if you want a dessert alcoholic beverage, give these a try.
 Put the espresso powder and the hot water in a small bowl and stir them together until the powder has fully dissolved. Allow it to cool completely. Freeze the coffee into cubes by pouring it into a clean ice cube tray and placing in the freezer.

It will take about two hours to fully set.
 Put about five scoops of coconut ice cream into the blender. Add the sweetened condensed milk, followed by the frozen espresso cubes. Blend for approximately two minutes until the ingredients are fully blended.

Serve immediately in a frosted glass.
Top the shake off with whipped cream and shredded coconut (optional).
 Put the glasses into the freezer until they are nice and cold. Remove and pour the caramel into the glasses. Put the ice cream, caramel sauce and milk into the blender. Lastly, add the salt and rum. Pulse the blender on low until the ingredients have fully mixed.

Transfer into the cold glasses and serve immediately.
Top it off with whipped cream and a drizzle of the caramel sauce (optional).

 Arthritis is common in Rottweilers because of their genetic tendency to hip dysplasia, which causes poorly formed hips in young animals. The poor shape of the hip joint means the wear and tear is greater, leading to inflammation and arthritis.In addition, osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD) can lead to damaged joint surfaces in a young, growing dog, leading to premature arthritis.
 You can help decrease the chances of getting a dog with arthritis by buying a dog from a breeder who screens his breeding stock for hip dysplasia and can provide certification to prove the dogs have good hips., Another way to help prevent arthritis is to not overexert the puppy or make the puppy take part in exercise, such as agility, until she is old enough. This places stress on the joints. Avoid these activities until she is 18 months old, because hip dysplasia will have presented by this age.


This doesn’t mean you can’t play with her or she shouldn’t exercise. Just take it easy on her joints.
 Carrying extra weight places added strain on the joints and should be avoided. Thus it is best to keep the Rottweiler in slim body condition for a long and active life.
 Arthritis can affect any joint in the body. However, most often the shoulders, hips, elbows, knees, and ankles are affected.

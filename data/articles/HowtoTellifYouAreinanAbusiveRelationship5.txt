 Financial or economic abuse involves controlling you through money. This can entail an abuser not allowing you to have your own money whether or not you earned it.


An abuser might take your credit cards. He could start a credit card in your name and ruin your credit history when he doesn’t pay the bill.
On the flip side, an abuser also might move into your home and not contribute to paying any of the bills or expenses. He might withhold money for your basic needs (such as buying groceries or filling prescriptions)., Abusers utilize technology like cell phones, email accounts and social media accounts to threaten or bully you, or stalk or intimidate you. Abusers use social media to send you harassing messages, blackmail you, and stalk you.


An abuser may insist you have your cell phone at all times. He might demand that you answer the phone the moment it rings.
 Stalking, or “obsessional following,” is when an abuser monitors your actions and movements. This can happen with someone with whom you’re not romantically involved. But in an intimate partner relationship, your partner can still stalk you. Oftentimes, this happens when the relationship is ending. It can, however, happen when the relationship is still going on. This type of surveillance and over-possessiveness typically causes fear. Your partner may be stalking you if:


He turns up at places that you regularly go to.
He secretly follows you.
He is spying on you.
He sends you threatening cards or letters in the mail.
He leaves threatening phone messages for you.
He damages your personal property.
He threatens or accosts other people that you’re close to.

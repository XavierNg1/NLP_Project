 If your dog is suffering from any kind of neck pain, a collar may cause too much strain and discomfort on his neck and spine. A harness can be a useful alternative, as it spreads pressure over his chest and does not put any strain on your dog's neck. Avoid using a collar, and opt for unleashed, fenced-in yard time whenever possible instead of walking your dog on a leash., Heat therapy is a useful tool in relieving mild neck discomfort, especially in dogs with arthritis.Follow the directions bag's packaging and heat for the appropriate time. Then speak calmly to the dog, encourage him to lie down, and place the bag over his neck for a period of five to ten minutes at a time.
 If your dog is suffering from neck pain, he may have a hard time lowering his head to eat and drink out of his bowl if you keep it on the floor. Keep your dog's bowl elevated to a height that allows him to eat and drink without having to bend and stoop., It is important when managing neck pain to be alert for any deterioration in the dog's mobility. Neck pain is often a warning sign of other impending health problems, so it's important to determine and treat the cause of the pain, rather than just the pain itself.


Any dog with neck pain should be rested as movement is likely to make the pain worse. If the dog has other symptoms, such as if he goes off his food, then a vet check is essential.

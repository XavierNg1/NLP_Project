,, Do which ever cast on method you like. It's recommended that you do not use the backwards loop method, as the loops can twist around and come undone.
 Make sure all of your stitches are straight on the needles and facing the same direction.
 What this means is you need to join the knitting yarn to the work so it is one continuous circle. Hold the needle where the cast on began in your left hand and hold the other needle in your right hand. Begin knitting with the working yarn, making sure you are connecting the yarn to the beginning and creating a circle.
 Otherwise you may have a ladder form where you joined the yarn, and you don't want that to happen.
 (If you don't have a stitch marker you can use a paper clip.) This is not completely necessary, as you can see where the round starts with the tail yarn, but it's very helpful if you're knitting a complex pattern.
 A tube like structure should begin to form.

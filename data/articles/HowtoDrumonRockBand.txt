 Don't keep your foot on the upbeat whenever it's not playing. Rest it by keeping it pressed down when there isn't a note for the bass. Also, practice with shoes and take them off when you're attempting during a show.
 Have your foot on the pedal with the balls of your feet on the edge of the top of the pedal. It increases stamina and responds faster. Keep your heel up!

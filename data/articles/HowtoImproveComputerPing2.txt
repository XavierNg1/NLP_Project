Head to the Downloads folder on your File Manager.
Double-click the downloaded installer to begin installation.
Follow the on-screen instructions; they are pretty easy and straightforward.
, This will make the program scour the Internet for your driver and their updates.


After the scan finishes, it will take you to a screen listing the drivers that may be updated.
If your Network Card Driver appears (which usually has “Ethernet Controller” in its name), download the update for it by clicking Download Update beside its name.
 In the window that pops up, click "Yes."


The download and update process will restart your computer several times, depending on how many drivers you had it update.
 Go through the Network Driver’s setup wizard, which will have easy-to-follow on-screen instructions.

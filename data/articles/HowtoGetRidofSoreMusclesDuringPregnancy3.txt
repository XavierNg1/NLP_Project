 As your uterus expands, aches and pains occur due to overworked muscles in the back, abdomen and thighs. The reason these muscles get sore while pregnant is that you are carrying more weight in the front of your body than normal. As a result, muscles that are not normally used are activated and become sore.


Lactic acid, the by-product of muscle metabolism, accumulates in the muscles when muscles more than normal. Lactic acid can irritate the muscles and lead to discomfort and soreness., Often during pregnancy women have back pain that can be aching and sharp. Somewhere between one half and three quarters of all pregnant women have back pain at some point during their pregnancy.
 Lower abdominal cramping is normal as a baby is growing inside your belly. The uterus gets bigger every day along with the baby, stretching out the ligaments and muscles that support it in order to accommodate the changes. This stretching process makes the muscles sore, especially when you change positions, if you are particularly active, or when you cough.
 Thigh muscles are responsible for walking and maintaining your posture. These activities can become a challenge during pregnancy and can cause stress to the muscles because of the additional weight. The more weight you gain, the greater the pull of gravity on your body.


The additional work your legs must do to walk and stand can lead to the accumulation of lactic acid in the legs and irritate your muscles.

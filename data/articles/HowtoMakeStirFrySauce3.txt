 This recipe is slightly more complicated than some of the others in the article as it requires some of the ingredients to be cooked separate from each other, then combined, rather than cooked all together.To begin, mix the ingredients above in a bowl, then mix thoroughly as normal, making sure to dissolve the sugar.
 Next, heat a pan on the stove over high heat. Add the peanut oil, then, just before it begins to smoke, toss in the ginger and red pepper flakes (if the oil starts to smoke, reduce the heat slightly before adding the other ingredients). Allow the ginger to cook until fragrant and golden, stirring frequently (this should only take a minute or two).


To mince your ginger, first, use a sharp knife to shave off its light brown skin, exposing the whitish or orange-ish flesh underneath. Chop the ginger into very fine pieces or use a food processor to render it into tiny bits.
 Pour the liquid mixture into the pan with the ginger. Stir to combine. Allow the sauce to simmer until it thickens slightly, gains a glossy appearance, and smells appetizing (this shouldn't take much longer than a minute).


When the sauce is ready, remove it from heat, add it to your stir fry as normal (or set aside as a dipping sauce) and serve!

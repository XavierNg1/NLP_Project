 Use small pieces of tape to attach both sides together.;
, Keep it within the paper; do not cut to the edges anywhere. This shape will help you to see the light better. The base is now done.
 Also cut out six small circles that will be used as facial features on the holder.
, Leave sufficient room for the facial features to be placed above it.



Attach two of the black circles and attach to the middle of the cover, about 1.5cm away from each other (these will be the eyes).
Use another black circle to make the nose so place, placing it about 3 centimeters down from the eyes and between the two eyes.
Attach another black circle about 1 inch down from the nose.
The face of "Frankenstein's monster" is now complete.
 Do the same on the other side.
 Draw it like a sideways triangle. This forms the scar on Frankenstein's monster's face.
 Turn it on to watch it glow. That's it; you've finished creating a festive Halloween Frankenstein's monster candle cover.

 On a small plate, combine 2 parts of antibacterial dish soap with 1 part of olive oil. Swirl the two together with a spoon until they’re fully mixed.The antibacterial soap will kill any germs or bacteria on the brushes, while the olive oil will help break down stubborn makeup so the brushes rinse clean.
Don’t use a paper plate for mixing the cleaner. The oil will seep through paper.;
, Take the brushes that you plan to clean and run them under lukewarm water. Run your fingers over the bristles to ensure that they’re all completely wet.Be careful to hold the brushes with the bristles facing down when you wet them. If water gets inside the brushes’ ferrell, the part of the brushes just below the bristles that holds them to the handle, it may loosen the glue so bristles start falling out.
 Coat all of the brushes’ bristles with the soap mixture. Next, run the brushes back and forth over the palm of your hand to work the cleaner in. Keep moving the brushes over your hand until the suds are no longer colored with makeup.For extremely dirty makeup brushes, you may need to wipe off the suds and dip the brushes in the cleaner a second time.
 Once the soapy residue is no longer colored, run the brushes under lukewarm water until no suds come out of the bristles. Gently reshape the wet bristles with your fingers, and lay them flat to air dry.If possible, lay your brushes flat on the edge of a table or counter so the bristles hang over the edge. That will keep any moisture from seeping into the ferrule.

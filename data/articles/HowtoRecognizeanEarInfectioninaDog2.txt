 It is worth being aware that your dog may not display the same behavioral symptoms as other dogs. However, if you see any physical symptoms, or even simply witness your dog acting differently than normally, you should consult a vet.If the first sign you see is ignored, it is very likely that other symptoms will develop as the infection gets worse. This means that your dog will experience discomfort for a longer period of time.
 Ear infections are often itchy and uncomfortable. Ear mites, in particular, tickle the ear canal, which prompts a dog to scratch or rub his ear. Another source of ear irritation is an allergic reaction. Many dogs who suffer from an allergy to something in their diet can be prone to skin inflammation that localizes in and around the ear. This inflammation prompts the dog to rub or scratch the area, causing further soreness.


A variation on the ear scratching behavior is tilting the head to one side. If your dog is doing this, you may notice that he will tip one side of his head towards the ground. For example, if your dog has an infection in his left ear, he will tip his head so that his left ear is closest to the ground., Dogs show that they are in pain in a number of ways. Some may become grumpy and short-tempered; if your dog seems snappish, do not touch the ear unless you absolutely have to, and bring him to a vet.Other dogs may wince or whimper when you gently touch the ear, or the area around the ear.
If the pain is severe the dog may lose his appetite, and seem listless. This is a non-specific sign, and if it persists is enough in itself to warrant getting him checked by the vet.

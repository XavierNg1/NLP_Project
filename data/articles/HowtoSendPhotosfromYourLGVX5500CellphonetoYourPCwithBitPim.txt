,, Use your USB cable and connect the cellphone to the computer’s USB port.
,, Enter ‘Com 7’ into the ‘Com Port’ textbox (Because Com numbers are used differently on each computer, you may have to select a different Com number by clicking on the ‘Browse’ button – but try Com 7 first). Hit OK to close window.
 Un-check all the boxes on the left side of the pop-up window – except for this one - ‘SMS’. Click ‘OK’ to close the window. You may see the message, “Access to file/dir has been blocked on this phone by the phone provider”. Ignore this message and just click ‘OK’. Scroll down (left window on screen) and double click on ‘FileSystem’. Double click (in middle window) on the folder at the top - Wait for about ten to 20 seconds for the program to load all the data from your cellphone.
 Open it up and scroll down and find a folder called ‘MOD’. Open this folder and you will see a list of numbers (example: 10888, 10889, etc.). Double click each of these folders and you will find all your photos you took with your cellphone. The files are in the ‘.jpg’ format. Right click on any jpg file and click save. That’s it!

 Grilling hot dogs results in a pleasant smoky taste, and many consider this to be the best way to prepare them. Any sort of grill will work, so go ahead and light your charcoal, gas, or wood-fired grill.


While the grill is heating up, prepare the hot dog buns and condiments. Hot dogs are best enjoyed hot from the grill.
Make sure that one side of the grill is hot and one side of the grill is a little cooler. You can do this by stacking up the charcoal a little higher on one side. If you have a gas grill, you should be able to control the heat using the knobs on your appliance to make hot dogs good.;
, Place them at an angle to create a diagonal sear-mark on the dog.
 Hot dogs come already cooked, so your goal here isn't to cook the dog so much as give it some good color and get it piping hot without burning it.


Keep turning the dogs until all sides have developed a nice, even char.
If the dogs are hot but have not developed color, move them over to the hot side of the grill. Grill them quickly, just to develop a bit of char, and then move them to a plate.
 Place them in a bun and serve with any combination of mustard, ketchup, relish, onion, tomato, cheese, or sauerkraut.

 For this style of ornament, you'll need 2 to 3 different perfumes, a variety of colored paints, some paintbrushes and string. Of course, you'll also need as many pine cones as you wish to make ornaments.
,,,


Make sure it's dry before proceeding.
,, Decorate each little pine cone scales with a little shape or polka dot. Only do the shape if you're comfortable drawing it (or you could use a small stencil).



If you would like, you can add glitter or sequins.



Spray the perfume on the decorated pine cone. Be generous and add a good amount, so it will last.
 String the pine cone by finding the stem, then tying the string onto the stem.

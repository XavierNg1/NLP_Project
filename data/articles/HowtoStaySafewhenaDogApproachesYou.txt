 Don't. The best way to react is to stand still. You should drop anything you are holding, because this may be what is attracting the dog to you. The dog may think this is a game, and start chasing you if you begin to run away. Don't shout or wave your arms as this will either encourage or frighten the dog. Acting bored and not making eye contact will cause most dogs to lose interest quickly.;
, This could be perceived as a threat. If possible keep moving forward in a proud and confident manner, ignoring the dog. If you are scared the dog will pick up on that as weak energy, and may attack that.
 If this happens you should turn away. Don't shout or push the dog down, as this may make it think this is part of a game. Ignore the dog and he will eventually get bored and walk away.
 Keep your head and arms tucked under your body. You should remain in this position until the dog gets bored and leaves you.

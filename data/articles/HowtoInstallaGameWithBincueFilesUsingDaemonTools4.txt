 If Autoplay is enabled, the installation program should begin automatically.


If Autoplay is not enabled, and nothing happens when you mount the image, open Computer or My computer. Right click on the virtual drive and select Open.
 If you need to change discs during the installation process, unmount the first image by right clicking on the virtual drive in Daemon Tools and click Unmount.


Mount the image of the next disc that you need using the above steps, and proceed with the installation.
 Most games require that the CD or DVD be inserted to play. You will need to keep the image mounted in order to play in this case. You may need to change images to the Play disc as opposed to the Install disc(s).

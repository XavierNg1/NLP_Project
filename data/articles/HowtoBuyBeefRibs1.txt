The back ribs are cut from the top section of the rib and contain some of the flavorful and fatty rib roast meat. There are 13 ribs to each side of the steer and they can be cut from the rib roast or loin portion of the steer. The ribs cut from closer to the rib roast are often trimmed close to the bone with little meat on them except for what is between the bones. Ribs cut from the loin section are often slightly meatier, though they are slightly less flavorful.;

Beef back ribs can be cut to any length, from dino ribs which are about 18 inches (46 cm) long to a more manageable 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm). They can be packaged in groups of 13 bones all the way to packages of single bones. Most home cooks don't have the equipment to cook the dino ribs, so you may need to special order those from the butcher.



Ribs requiring the least amount of butchering are generally the least expensive. Single portion ribs are typically the most expensive. Ribs that come from the rib roast (closer to the head of the steer) may also be more expensive than those cut from the loin.



Due to the varying cuts of rib bone length, it is difficult to say how much each person might eat in rib bone weight. Consider instead that each person might eat 2 to 3 bones, perhaps an additional if the bones are cut shorter than 6 inches (15 cm) long.

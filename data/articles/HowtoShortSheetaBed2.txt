 This is an easy trick if you live with the victim, or share a room with them. Once you learn the victim’s sleep schedule, you can begin to plan around this time. If they go to sleep every night at 10:00 PM, you have up until that point to make your move.
 Once you find out their normal sleep schedule, you should learn what time you should prepare the prank. If they go to school or work, you can use this time to prepare the prank. It could help if you talk to them the previous night:”So Jamie, you have any plans tomorrow?”
”Working for the man tomorrow?”
”I’m going to the grocery store tomorrow, you want to come?”

, It will help if you know how the person's bed is normally made. The more you can make it appear normal, the less suspicious (and more surprised) the victim will be. Don’t get caught snooping on them as they’re dressing the bed. Instead, you should plan to inspect the bed at a separate time.A lot of people don’t use sheets and only use a comforter or duvet. Make sure your victim uses a sheet or else the short sheet technique will not work.
Make sure they typically fold the inner sheet underneath the comforter.
 Some people are better learners with a visual cue. Take a picture of how the bed looks before you tamper with the bed. Once you are making the bed again, you’ll have a visual cue to base the presentation on.

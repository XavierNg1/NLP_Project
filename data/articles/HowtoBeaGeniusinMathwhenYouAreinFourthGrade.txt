 You cannot become a genius at math if you do not first become familiar with the basic concepts.


Sit near the front so it is easy to hear.
Don't sit next to your best friends. This way, you won't be tempted to talk in class.
If you're a fidgeter, bring a small fidget toy to keep your hands busy, such as a pencil topper or stress ball.
Sit next to quiet, hardworking people.
Raise your hand and ask questions if you are confused. Teachers like this, because it shows that you care about learning and work hard.;
, Nobody becomes good at math without working hard. Look at the examples in your textbook, and follow along. Try setting up a similar problem and solving it step by step. Make up some practice problems, or ask your parents to make some, and find the solutions.
 Start your homework as soon as you come home, so the lesson is still fresh in your mind. Try to write down each step that you take so that you can double check, and so that the teacher knows that you are working it out right.
 It doesn't have to be a long study sessionâ€”one or two sessions of 15 minutes will work just fine. Try scheduling them at a specific time, to help make sure that you don't forget and miss days.


If you're doing a longer study session, schedule some quick breaks to keep your brain fresh.
 Avoid cramming or staying up late to study. Eating well and getting lots of sleep will help you have the energy to do your best.
 If you don't know how to do something, then ask your teacher or one of your friends how to do it. Ask them how to work it out instead of asking them for the answers.
 You'll be much more motivated to succeed if you can make studying fun.


Try finding some maths puzzles or books, such as the Murderous Maths books.
Play online math games.
Quiz your friends, parents, or siblings.

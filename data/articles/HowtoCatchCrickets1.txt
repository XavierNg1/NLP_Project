 This is cricket food! If you want to catch a few dozen crickets, a cup of sugar and a cup of breadcrumbs should be plenty.


Don't use spicy or flavored breadcrumbs. Plain breadcrumbs are best for catching crickets, and extra ingredients might deter them.
You can mix up a big batch of sugar and breadcrumbs and store whatever is left over in a jar for later use. This way you can catch more crickets every few days.;
, This method may be best to use outside, since sprinkling this mixture indoors may draw other pests, like roaches and mice. Sprinkle the mixture at dusk just before the nocturnal crickets will come out to play.
 Lay it out over the area where you sprinkled the sugar and breadcrumbs. Use no more than a single layer, since you want the crickets to be able to get underneath it.
 Get a big glass jar or a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. Poke holes in the lid if you want to keep the crickets alive once you catch them.


There are special containers you can use for storing live crickets. Visit a bait store to check out their options, or look online and order one.
You can sprinkle some of the sugar and bread mixture in the jar to keep the crickets fed.
 This is prime time for catching crickets. Their bellies will be full and they'll be calmly waiting for you under the layer of newspaper. If you wait until the sun dries the dew, the crickets will have time to hop away.
 You can use a scoop or a small brush to nudge them into the container. Place the lid on tightly once you've caught your crickets.

 Keep the thread unknotted. For this technique, it is best to use the finer threads.


The idea here is that two or three fine threads roughly equates to working with a single medium-sized strand of thread.
Use threads 60-80 for this technique.
 You can also work parts with just one thread to create both texture and coloring effects as you so desire. Of course, you can't carry thread the way you can in crocheting or knitting, but it still can be done to a certain degree. Just experiment––you are only limited by your imagination!

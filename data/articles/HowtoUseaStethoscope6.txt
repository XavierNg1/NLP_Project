 If you have detected a sound that seems like a heart murmur, you should also check for a bruit. Since heart murmurs and bruits sound similar, it is important to check for both if one is suspected.
 The carotid arteries are located in the front of your patient’s neck, on either side of the Adam’s apple. If you take your index and middle finger and run them down the front of your throat, you will trace over the locations of your two carotid arteries.Be careful not to press too hard on the artery or you may cut off circulation and cause your patient to faint. Never press on both carotid arteries at the same time., A bruit makes a whooshing sound that indicates that an artery is narrowed. Sometimes a bruit may be confused with a murmur because they sound similar, but if the patient has a bruit then the whooshing sound will be louder when you listen to the carotid artery than when you listen to the heart.You may also want to listen for bruits over the abdominal aorta, renal arteries, iliac arteries and femoral arteries.

 Organize disaster preparedness drills with your family for earthquakes, tornadoes, fires, or any other disaster until the repetition locks in and you know for sure what to do. Your chances of surviving a disaster increase significantly if you've been prepped on how to make it out well in advance.;
, Don't waste time debating if there really is a fire or not, if a recent earthquake triggered a tsunami or not, etc. Get to safety first, ask questions later.
 Patience isn't usually a virtue when trying to survive a disaster. Oftentimes, people are more inclined to dwindle in bewilderment during a disaster rather than trying to escape as quickly and safely as possible.
 Don't risk your safety by returning to the scene of a disaster for any personal belongings. Those few seconds could cost you your life.
 These are the people you'll be in the same situation with during a disaster.

 While, customarily, people have greeted each other with handshakes when first introduced, these days people frequently hug on introduction without thinking twice about it.


This is more often seen among groups of friends than one friend introducing you to another friend.
Use your instincts, but the best rule of thumb is that if you're offered a hug, go for it.
 Remember to keep the physical contact quick and light for hugging friends. Anything more prolonged might be misinterpreted as romantic.


Lean in, bending from your waist. The idea here is not full-body contact, which is a much more intimate and personal hug.
Wrap one arm around her arm, and place your hand in-between her shoulder blades.
Wrap your other arm around her, and place your hand below your first hand.
 Two seconds is the ideal length for a friend hug. Let go of her as soon as this much time has passed, and resume conversing as you normally would.

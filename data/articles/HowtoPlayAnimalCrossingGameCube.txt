 There is a cat named Rover, and he will ask you your name, gender, and the name of the town you're headed to. He'll also set you up with your first house, by telling his friend who owns the store in your town to sell you one. Fill in the info with what you want and then you'll come to your village.;
, There are several different faces, and if you don't like yours, just reset the game and start over.
 He owns the shop, and you'll sell your stuff to him to earn money later. He takes you to a group of four houses and you'll choose one to live in. He'll tell you about the little brown thing which is called a Gyroid, that's how you'll save the game. You have 1000 bells (the currency in the game) which you must give to him, but that's not enough. He tells you to go to his shop later to work off your debt. To find it, go back to the train station and go to the sign. It's a map and will tell you about all the places and people living in town including Nook's shop. Once you're there he'll have you do errands for him as his employee until he's run out of them. They include meeting everyone in town, and delivering things. this doesn't last long, but afterward, there's still a debt to pay. He'll tell you how to pay it off. Once you're all set, go ahead and explore all the things you can do. The possibilities are endless!

, This is important, as it gives visitors a good first impression.

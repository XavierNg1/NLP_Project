 Choose a route with sidewalks if you can, and which crosses very few, if any, busy streets. If there is a construction project in progress on one street, make a route which avoids the construction, even if this will result in a longer walk.;
, If the route is difficult to remember, or if the child is very young, you may want to walk the route several times together before the child has to walk alone. Do this before the first day of school, or plan on meeting your child for the first few days of school.
 Point out the homes of family friends where the child might stop for help in case of trouble. Quiz the child as you pass these homes so that they will learn to recognize the right homes.
, Walking with a buddy will be helpful to your child in case any emergency should occur.
,, Put on speed dial the local emergency number in your area, as well as that of yourself and the other relatives or friends you know will be available to help your child if the need arises.
 There are some hazards that only arise in particular seasons. One important hazard is to warn children to keep well away from snow clearing vehicles. If children see snow clearing of a bank at the edge of a street crossing, tell your children to stand well back until the snow plough or vehicle has left. Children have come to grief by falling under such equipment as it is being used and it is often impossible for the driver to see children in this situation. Another big danger is storm water drains filling quickly during rainy weather. Make sure that your children understand that it is never OK to cross such drains or play in them. In some regions, these drains can fill very quickly without warning and even strong swimmers cannot escape the swirling water.

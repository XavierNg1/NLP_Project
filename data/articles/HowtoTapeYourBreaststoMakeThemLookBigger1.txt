You might only use three, but rip four pieces just in case., Start your first piece of tape on the outer bottom of your left breast. Use your right hand to lay this tape. Tape half of it down. Make sure it is securely stuck by using both hands to rub the tape on., Hold onto the end of the tape that’s stuck to your body with your left hand. Pull the tape as tight as you can, and hold it, with your right hand. Release your left hand. Use your left hand to pull your right breast as close to your left breast as you can. Lay the rest of the tape under your right breast to hold it here., This time, start with your right breast. Follow the same process. You want your tape to be half on the first piece of tape and half above it. Pull your breasts toward each other even tighter when you place this tape across them.

If it doesn’t stretch across the tape on both sides, add the fourth piece to finish securing it., For added cleavage, use a small piece of tape. Rip a piece of tape, no more than two inches long. Pinch the center of the tape that’s holding your breasts (you’ll be pinching directly under your cleavage).

 Once you see the Bob-omb appear on the stage, you will need to pick it up quickly, before it activates its self-destructive timer automatically.;
, Most likely, this will be your opponent (or your opponents). You might use the Bob-omb to detonate a Motion Sensor bomb, to destroy a container, or to detonate other loose Bob-ombs.
 You shouldn't run straight toward your opponent and fling the Bob-omb toward him/her. Try to fake out your opponent by throwing the Bob-omb when he or she least expects it.


Don't forget that you can throw Bob-ombs while in the air. You might try jumping above your opponent and throwing downward toward him or her. Be careful not to do this too often.
 Use Z, L, R, or A to throw the Bob-omb toward your target. Remember that you can throw in any four directions.

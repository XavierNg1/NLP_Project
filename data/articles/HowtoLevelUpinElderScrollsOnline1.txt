 The key to leveling skills quickly is to emphasize and choose skills that you will actually use in the first place. Using skills means that you gain experience with them, and the more you use them the more experience you'll get. So while a certain ability or weapon may be cool, don't be surprised if it slows you down when it comes to leveling.;
, Certain races have bonuses to XP (experience) with certain skills. Examples include Altmer with Destruction Staffs, Bosmer with bows, Bretons with Light Armor, and Khajiit with Medium Armor. Decide what skill you really want to be good with and then consider creating a character with that race bonus.
 It takes time to figure out just the right build and just the right skills you'll need in order to get your character leveled up quickly. Even just deciding what skills you care about the most can take time. You may need to experiment, so be patient.

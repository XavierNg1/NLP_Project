EXE files may not run properly if they were designed for an outdated version of Windows. You can try adjusting the compatibility settings by right-clicking on the file, selecting "Properties", and then clicking the Compatibility tab. You can set what version of Windows you want run the EXE file as, but this is not guaranteed to solve the problem.;

 Since slow download speeds are most noticeable, start there.


Download speeds affect things like streaming media (such as Spotify or Youtube), downloading documents, and browsing the web.
Cheaper broadband packages for basic Internet access usually include 1.5-3mbps.This should be good enough for basic web use, but you’ll want at least 5mbps to stream high-quality video.Most mid-grade home user packages are closer to 10-20 mbps, which is better equipped to handle HD streaming on more than one computer. Check with your ISP to find out what you have.
 The upload speed results reflect the speed of data you send out, such as when you attach files to an email, upload photos or videos to the web, use video conferencing, or share files using a service like BitTorrent.


Some apps and sites, like Fast.com, won’t report an upload speed. This is because most users tend to be more concerned with download speeds as they affect media streaming and web browsing.
1-4mbps should be fine for users who don’t share a lot of large files or use video conferencing. It’s not common for a home user to have a 10mbps or more upload rate.
 Higher ping times (such as 100ms or more) indicate network trouble between your modem and the server.


ISPs don’t guarantee certain ping results, as such results can be affected by outside networks.

 Search websites such as eBay.com and Gumtree for a used copy of Pokémon Emerald.
 Check to see if the save file on the copy has collected the special Event Pokémon Celebi, and has it in either their box or in their party ready to trade.
 Purchase the used copy of the game and wait for it to arrive. From there, you can either choose to trade the Celebi within the bought copy over to your own personal copy of the game or continue to play on the other instead.

 Sometimes you’ll need to physically remove plastic from the disc by polishing. However, removing a lot of plastic can affect the refractive property of the lens making the data unreadable. Waxing scratches is useful because even though the defects are visible to your eye, the laser sees around/through them., Apply a very thin coat of Vaseline, chap-stick, liquid car wax, neutral shoe polish, or furniture wax to the CD’s playing surface. Let the wax sit in the scratches for a few minutes—remember, the idea is for the wax to fill in the scratch so it can be read again., Using a clean, soft, lint-free cloth, wipe in a radial (inside-to-outside) motion. If using wax, follow the manufacturer’s instructions (some need to dry before you wipe them off, while others should be wiped off while still wet).
 If the wax or Vaseline does the trick, burn a new disc immediately. The waxing method is only a temporary solution meant to get the CD working long enough to transfer the data to a computer or new disc.

 You won't be able to readjust creeping panties while you say your vows, so if you choose something uncomfortable, you'll have to stay uncomfortable. Since weddings and receptions can take a while, this is best avoided. Wear a panty style you know you feel comfortable in rather than choosing a different type for the sake of being sultry.
 Look for seamless styles to prevent a panty line from showing through, and avoid added details like lace or ribbons that could create little bumps beneath the fabric.
 Gowns that are especially thin or slinky may show a panty line no matter what type you choose. Some pantyhose come with built-in underwear, however, which may create the smooth line you need.
 Lace and sheer fabrics allow your skin to teasingly peek through. Try to choose panties that match your bra to keep things looking uniform and to maximize your sex appeal.
 Both options cover your rear, but boy shorts are a little tighter than tap pants. These options blend comfort with seduction, since racy details, like lace or mesh, can make these otherwise conservative options a little sultrier.
 These traditionally sexy panties offer no rear coverage, and many women may find them uncomfortable. If you do opt for this choice, look for one made of seamless microfiber, mesh, or cotton to reduce any possible discomfort.

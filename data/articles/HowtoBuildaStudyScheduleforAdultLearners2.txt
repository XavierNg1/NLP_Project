 Be aware that this step is the most difficult one for many adult students. When you are working, going to school, and maintaining other adult responsibilities, it seems ridiculous to plan some fun, but relaxation and renewal are vitally important to your performing at your best. Research demonstrates that students perform better when they give themselves a few renewing breaks through the week.Of course, you cannot allot this too much time, but a 15 to 30 minute bike ride or walk each every day can go a long way to helping you better focus and perform on school work.
 Most students mistakenly think this is the first step but it's the last step because you need to make sure you can really study at the times you block off.


Gather all your class syllabi and make sure you know what is expected in each class.
Until you know how much time you personally are going to need to study various subjects, a good rule of thumb is to plan 3 hours of study for each hour you are in a lecture (especially for your tough classes). If you have 3 hours of lecture, then you need to plan 9 hours of study a week. (Note: you will notice that taking a full class load means that you need to study almost 40 hours a week, so be careful how many classes you carry each term!)
Decide which is going to be your most difficult class and decide how many hours a week you need to devote to that class.
Look at your open times on the 'Working Plan' and decide when you will be at your best. Put study times for the difficult class into your 'best' times.
Now, block in the study times for your other classes.
Mark all times as study and list the topic, for example, "Study Statistics."

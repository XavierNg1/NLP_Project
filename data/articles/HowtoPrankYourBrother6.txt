 If he loves to channel surf as much as the average brother, then this will be the perfect prank for him. Just take a tiny piece of clear tape and cover the light on the remote just enough so that it no longer works. He'll be completely confused when he tries to watch his favorite show, and may even try to put in new batteries before he figures out your trick (if he figures it out at all!). This works best when you have his least favorite TV show playing.
 Make a box of jello and pour a layer into a container large enough to hold the game controller. Use food wrap to completely cover the game controller, then for added security, place it into an airtight bag and seal tightly. When the layer of jello has hardened, place the controller on top and cover it with a layer of liquid jello. Let it harden. Take out the jello. Place the controller back and watch him freak out., If he actually manages to step away from his computer for five minutes, change his desktop picture to something completely ridiculous as quickly as you can. Pick My Little Ponies, Teletubbies, or pictures of the cutest cats you've ever seen. This works best if he has a laptop that he'll be taking out in public later, so he can surprise a room full of people with the desktop filled with flowers and puppies.

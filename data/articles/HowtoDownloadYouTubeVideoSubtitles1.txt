On KeepVid, the options appear after you enter your link and click “Download”. The different quality and format options appear as a list of individual links.
 The video will be saved in your downloads folder by default, but if you right click the link, then click “Save As”, you can download the video anywhere you like, as well as rename it if you wish. Because the subtitles are part of the video, they will appear regardless of the format or quality.

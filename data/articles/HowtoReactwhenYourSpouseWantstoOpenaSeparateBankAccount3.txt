 If you and your partner decide to have separate accounts, it is important that you find an equitable means of dividing household expenses. When you put together your household budget, talk with your partner about how much they can contribute to your shared expenses. It is important that you come to a consensus on how much each of you will contribute to your joints expenses each month.For example, if your shared expenses are $2,000, make sure that you and your partner each contribute $1,000 from your personal accounts.
If one of your makes more money than the other, the person who makes more may need to pay a larger portion of the shared expenses. Talk about this to avoid any resentments or hard feelings.
 Whenever you or your partner receives any extra income that you did not budget for, say from a work bonus or as a gift, you should find a way to split the money equitably. Talk with your partner about what accounts the money should be deposited in. Just as you need to divide all expenses evenly, you should also find equitable ways of divvying up extra income.For example, if your partner gets a bonus, you may decide to keep half of the money in your partnerâ€™s account and put the rest in your joint savings account.
 In addition to your budgeted joint savings, you and your partner might also consider saving money from your individual accounts. At the end of the month, you and your partner may decide to put the remaining balances from your individual accounts into a shared savings account. This will ensure that withdrawing from the savings account is a mutual decision.For example, if you have a remaining balance of $100 in your personal account at the end of the month, deposit it in your shared savings account.

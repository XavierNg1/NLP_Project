 This will only encourage them to complain more often and loudly to make their voices heard.


Chronic complainers are attention-seekers, and denying such attention will only worsen their attitude.
 If the chronic complainer seems to be coming to you on a regular basis whenever their negativity needs an outlet, there might be a possibility that you've been selected as their favorite listener or problem-solver.Consider what you've done in the past that might have prompted them to think you're more sympathetic than others and change your response. For example, you might have given too much space to their complaint and too little to helping them focus on finding solutions themselves.Setting clear boundaries will contain their behavior. You will have to do it more than once until they've realized you're not the go-to person for their complaints. You can say "I love you and want to help, but I'll not just stay here and listen to how bad things are. If you want to think of solutions, you know where to find me." , Although it's hard for chronic complainers to change their take on life, positivity can be as contagious as negativity. Showing how you deal with problems yourself could work as evidence of the fact that there are different ways to approach life, and help the complainer change their attitude.
 If the number and intensity of chronic complaints has gotten out of control and you consider this person a friend, you should discuss their attitude and point out that their complaining is a default reaction to any situation, rather than a reasonable behavior.


Chronic complainers don't see themselves as negative people. They think life is especially harsh for them because of bad luck or honestly think problems are too huge for them to handle. Your helping them see this side of their personality will be a first step toward their acting upon it.

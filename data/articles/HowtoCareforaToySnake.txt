 It can be any size, as long as you have a box big enough for the snake.;
, The box can be an aquarium, plastic, or even a cardboard box. It should fit the snake. A good box is one that when the toy snake is coiled, it should be able to have at least one or two free spaces of room, without the snake touching anything around it when all the necessities are in the box.
 It can be a towel, blanket, gravel, wood shavings, or you can leave it bare, but if the floor is bare, it won't look very cool.
 This will be its water bowl/saucer. it should be big enough where the snake can fit in it, when coiled. And it should not be deep. DO NOT put real water in it unless the toy snake is waterproof. You could put those clear "rocks" that people put in fish tanks in the bowl, pretending it is water.
 Snakes MUST have a hide. Some examples are: Half a coconut, a log, a paper towel tube (if the snake fits in it when the snake is coiled), or even one of those little cloth bags. Keep in mind at how big the snake is, because it needs to be able to fit inside of the hide when the snake is coiled.
 Because snakes like to sit on rocks to get warm, and when it it is sunny, rocks get warm. If you don't have any smooth rocks for your snake to sit on, you can use a folded piece of cloth (e.g, a handkerchief) for your snake to sit on., It can be a normal name, like "Sam", or an exotic name, like "Zeus". You might want to name the snake based on it's features, (e.g, for a black snake, it's name could be "Midnight", "Shadow", or "Ebony".) Think about it's gender. Make up a personality for the toy snake. If the snake is feisty and mean, its name could be "Demon". If the snake is nice, and likes to be handled, its name could be "Sugar". Or name it a human name, like "Robert", "Bill", or "Mary".
 Plastic mice, or plastic frogs are good. "Feed" your snake one or two mice/frogs once a week, or once every other week.,

 Press and hold the Windows key and press R. A small box should pop up in the lower left-hand side of your screen. Type “CMD” into it and then hit Enter. A small black window will appear; this is CMD.
 CMD is run through a command line. You need to enter specific commands to start changing anything. One other cool command to start with is the “title” command. The title command has the power to change the way to look at the CMD title bar. For example, if you type “title Terminal” the title bar would change from “C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe” to “Terminal.” If you would like to see a complete list of switches and syntax for the command simply type “title /?” and hit Enter.
 Inside the CMD window you should see a blinking underscore. When you start typing, this is where you will be able to see your command being entered. Enter the command you want to use to change the title bar. Once you have finished typing the command, go ahead and hit the Enter key, and the command will run.


For some strange reason, this is not a command that the current CMD will remember to keep by default. So the next time you open the CMD window, you will see “C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe” up there again instead of the title you created. This may change in the future, but it may be a while.

 A magnifying glass might come in handy for looking for certain markings on each coin.;
, An envelope or jar will serve that purpose quite well. There are special folders or albums that you can buy which have special slots in them for each coin. At the right price, they will cost around $5 (depending on size)

, Collect only pennies, or nickels, or only coins made in or after a certain year.
 There's a history/geography lesson on each coin which provides a wonderful opportunity for children to learn about the country or world they live in.
 These can be found at any library or in any book store. There is also a book called Coin Collecting for Kids that helps expand the child's idea of just collecting for fun.

Memory loss is the first and earliest sign of dementia. It is, however, more than just forgetting where you put your keys. The memory loss must be widespread; forgetting names, places, and recent events are common. The person may also have difficulty recalling words or performing routine tasks such as following a recipe or using an appliance. Early dementia symptoms also include the inability to react to situations or they no longer care about personal hygiene. Aggressiveness and depression are also common.;

One type of dementia is called dementia with Lewy bodies. This is a brain disease that causes memory loss and the ability to plan and think. Early symptoms are swift changes between alertness and confusion, the inability to navigate familiar places, vivid visual hallucinations and long term memory loss.
Frontotemporal dementia is another form of dementia with its own symptoms and early behavior changes. People with this condition may have unusual behavior or personality changes. They may no longer care for those they ought to still care about, and they may make comments that are rude, sexually explicit or intentionally hurtful. Exposing themselves is not uncommon behavior.



If you feel like you might be losing your memory or if you have severe trouble remembering things, then talk to your doctor. Your doctor has the knowledge and skill to not only diagnose you properly, but to help you deal with your dementia.
If you think that somebody near to you is suffering from dementia, encourage them to seek medical help as soon as possible. Convincing them that they need help may be difficult but it is crucial.

Motion-activated devices are triggered once the possum crosses the sensor, and once these devices turn on, they may frighten many possums away.
Motion-activated sprinklers tend to be slightly more effective than motion-activated lights. Lights are enough to frighten away skittish possums that are afraid of humans, but water sprinklers work better with possums that are a little more mature and a little harder to startle.;
, The smell of a potential predator might be enough to deter many possums from hanging around.


Do not let your dog or cat roam free through the yard for the purpose of scaring away possums. They could get into a fight with aggressive possums or other dangerous animals.
Collect pet hair after brushing your dog or cat. Place the hair in small mesh bags and hang them or scatter them around areas at which possums frequently gather.
 Ammonia, mothballs, and garlic are all scents that possums tend to flee from.


Pour a small amount of ammonia into a coffee can with a lid. Place a rag inside the ammonia and bring one end up through a hole cut into the lid. The rag will act as a wick to disperse the fumes. Place one of these containers in every area where possums gather.
Scatter mothballs around any area where you have noticed possum activity. You can contain the mothballs in a mesh bag, or you can scatter them around individually.
Place a clove of crushed garlic in any area that you want neighborhood possums to avoid. Crushed garlic is better than whole garlic since crushing it first allows more of the scent to escape.
 Chemical repellents can be applied to gardens, flowerbeds, or the base of a structure.


Follow the instructions on the repellent to apply it safely. Most repellents consist of a powder that is sprinkled over the desired area.
Different repellents use different ingredients, but predator urine is often one element of it.

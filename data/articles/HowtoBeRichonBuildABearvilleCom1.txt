 A few great games to play to earn money are:


Photo Safari (x8)
Shake Your Honey (x6)
Pie Eating (x3)
Hugs (x5)
Fast Paw (x5)
Campfire Challenge (x5).;
, You can sell the stuff you get from there, as well as earning money.
 Click on the chairs that are on the ceiling. This leads you to a hidden room. While there, you can play a game where you have to find an item and you get rewarded with 200 bear bills. And if you cannot find the item, press the X and try again. But once you find an item, you can't play again until the next day.
 Play the game and press the keys really fast and then if you get full power you will get your own carnival bell and then every day you can play your very own carnival bell and get 60 bear bills a day! Note: You must have a bear to do this.

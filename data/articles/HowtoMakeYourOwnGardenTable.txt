 Check the sketch (image above) to get the basic idea as well.


Height = 76,5 cm (30,1 inches)
Length = 186 cm (70,9 inches)
Width = 92 cm (36,2 inches).;
, For this project, you'll need the items listed below in "Things You'll Need".
, Use a sander to smooth all the previously cut pieces.



Use a clamp when assembling every piece and make sure that all the joints are at 90 degree angles.
 Then put the screw through that hole. That ensures the screw will get where you wanted it to go.


Do not try to put the screw in if you haven't drilled the hole first.
 The planks enhance the stability of the legs and add to the visual appearance of the table.
 Now it's time to put the plate of the table on the frame. For the plate of the table you will use 92 cm (36.2 inches) planks.
 Every plank must be screwed down on four places; that means on every plank of the frame. This is important because it is very hard to acquire completely dry wood and if you donâ€™t tighten it down, it will bend and your table will be ruined. On the picture you can see how to assemble the plate on the frame.


Leave 1 cm (1/3 of an inch) space between every plank on the plate, for visual appearance.
 For the legs you will use 74 cm (29.1 inches) planks.
 Put three screws on every leg, so that they form a perfect triangle.



Make sure that the chosen paint protects the wood against the elements and always put on at least two coats of paint. A sealant layer is also recommended for longer wear and making the table spill-proof.

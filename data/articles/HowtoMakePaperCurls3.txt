 Larger hearts require thicker, longer strips of paper, whereas smaller, delicate hearts will come from thinner, shorter strips.


Avoid using construction paper for this project, as it is too heavy and won’t curl properly.
 No template is needed for this project––each heart is created from a strip of the quilling paper. Just make sure that you have an even measurement/edge on each strip. Note that a symmetrical heart has an equal width on each strip.
 Each heart should be created the same way, using your pencil and clean fingers.


Fold the paper strip in half. Make sure that the ends meet up evenly and you have a firm crease in the middle of the paper strip.
Place your pencil or pen side along the top of one of the paper strips. Hold the paper strip firmly next to the pencil.
Wind the pencil and paper downward toward the center crease of the paper. Wind halfway down the middle of the folded paper strip and then slowly remove the pencil.
Repeat the curling step on the other paper strip. Curl inward and stop halfway down.
 These can be glued onto cards, posters, etc., or glued together in a chain for a garland or wreath, etc.

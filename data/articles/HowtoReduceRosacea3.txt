 Antibiotics have been shown to offer some help for those with rosacea. Your doctor may prescribe you antibiotics in one of several forms, such a cream, gel, or a tablet. Because pills affect the whole body, your doctor will likely want you to try a cream, gel, or lotion first, as you just apply these topically to your face.Metronidazole is the standard of treatment for rosacea. The mechanism that it acts upon in unknown, but it is believed to be through antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties.
Topical metronidazole may be helpful in managing pustules and papules, while also contributing to the reduction of redness. It is available in 0.75% cream or gel, 1.0% cream or gel, or 0.75% lotion.
Topical metronidazole is generally well-tolerated, with potential side effects of irritation, dryness, and stinging sensation.
For severe rosacea, doxycycline, minocycline, and tetracycline may be used.

It can help reduce the look of blood vessels under your skin, as well as take down any build up of tissue to help your overall look., A new technique being used to control rosacea is light therapy. Light therapy uses intense light pulses on your face, and it may lessen the redness of your face.However, research is still being done on this treatment for rosacea.

 Dip a clean cotton cloth into white distilled vinegar. Don’t use apple cider vinegar as this will stain the suede., Using gentle pressure, press the cloth onto the stain(s) you’re trying to remove. Don’t press too hard as this will push the stain into the suede., After you’ve pressed down on the stain, wipe the cloth gently across the stain and against the grain. This gets the nap up and allows the vinegar to work into the stain itself., After you’ve pressed and wiped the gloves with vinegar, let them dry completely. Until the gloves are dry, you won’t be able to tell if the stains have been completely removed., Depending on the stain, you might need to repeat this step more than once. The gloves must dry completely in between each step.

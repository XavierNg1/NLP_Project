  Include scrap cardboard, masking tape, a glue stick, scissors, a paper punch, string, a roll of white crepe paper streamers, newspapers and a paper clip for hanging.;
,  The cardboard should be approximately 4" x 10" and not so heavy it can't be cut with scissors.
  This will be for a string for hanging your mummy.
  Wad up loosely, a whole sheet of newspaper.  Set it onto the mummy cut-out and mold it to fit the shape.  Wad up a quarter sheet of newspaper into a ball for the head.  Mold with your hands to make the padding fit the cut-out.  Using masking tape strips, going from side to side, secure the newspaper to the backing.
  Start at the feet and work upward. Use your hands to mold the crepe paper to conform to the cardboard form.  Use a glue stick to tack the binding on the back, as you go. Then, go down the mummy and add plenty of crepe paper.


For realism, criss-cross the binding strips.  When completely bound, turn to the back side and glue or tape your crepe paper securely.
  Use black marker.
,  Use the scissors or your fingers as a "feeler."  Put a string through the hole and tie it.
  Put it in a location to be seen often and by many. It will remind you of making this fun ornament.

 If advertising at a forum, be sure to put it in the advertising section or in your sig. For websites, you could try putting it in the guestbook or hooking up with the affiliates page. This step is a major key in getting new members. When advertising your forum, you may want to put the advertisement in the form of a mondo, eye-catching banner.;
, Visitors will be more obliged to join a forum that is well-combed. Try getting a good skin, good images, good smiles, and think up some good topics. If you can, try to put some features on your forum that aren't common on some of the more popular ones.
 Have them advertise it on other forums/websites and have them refer to good friends about the forum. You shouldn't force them to do so, but if they are loyal to your forum and want to see it grow, they'll be happy to oblige.
 If any member feels left out or is being mistreated, then they're most likely going to leave. Not only did you just lose a member, but you probably lost the member's ability to promote your forum.
 Visitors don't like to join dying forums, so be sure you can post something every day or so. If you're presenting something new every now and then, your current members will probably follow.
 This is where you create multiple accounts yourself and use them all so it seems like your forum is active, drawing in new members. Use this trick only if you are desperate. But remember, you will have to keep going into your other accounts to keep the secret hidden. If you made like 10 accounts, people will realize something is up. And remember, if you make someone a mod, they can see IP addresses on accounts. So they might know its you.
 For example, you could give someone moderator status for whoever helped out the most or something. You should make the contest meaningful and the prize worth fighting for. For instance, if you're a multimedia/movie/music related forum, you can give your users some DVD, video or such multimedia software.

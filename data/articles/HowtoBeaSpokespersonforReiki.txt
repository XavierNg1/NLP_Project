 You just never know when you might need them- whether it be conferences on holistic health, career training classes for alternative medicine, or wellness networking events, someone is going to ask you what you do.;
, Nothing says “I’m not sure”, like when you stumble on your own description of what you do or how you say it. It’s Reiki pronounced “Raki” but NOT spelled Reike.
 The client is the one who is doing the healing, you don’t possess magical powers. If you think you do, go back to Reiki 101. Reiki healing is not about you, it’s greater than you.
 If you are a counselor, then it is appropriate to announce that you are a mental health professional and offer counseling in your energy healing. So don’t feel you need to do more if you are not a counselor. Don’t claim to be one. You will violate ethics and possibly do a disservice to your clients.
 Some are interested in the practical applications of Reiki, or on Reiki instruction. Others are more curious about Reiki symbols and meditation associated with practice. Tailor your presentation to what the client (or audience) is asking for. You will keep them engaged and interested to ask more questions about your work!

, I often use the line, ‘Reiki is like acupuncture without needles’. It’s a quick, visual statement that clarifies for the listener what your topic is about.
 There is no substitute for learning Reiki (out of book or online) than an in-person class.
 Your client or audience will often ask questions you weren’t expecting. One person asked if he should address me as ‘Sensei’ (the Japanese word for Master).

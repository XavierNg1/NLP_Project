 Gather all your stones and practice forming your wall as your footing dries. A large part of forming a sandstone wall if you’re using uneven blocks is patience.This requires the same amount of focus and concentration as being active in completing a 5000 piece puzzle.
 Once you have a sufficient amount of blocks, create separate piles. Separating the blocks by size could save you a headache when your mortar is wet. You’ll be stacking them from largest to smallest, so arrange your groupings in a way that makes it easier for you to access the largest stones first.


Having an ample supply of smaller stones will also help fill gaps as you work.
 Lay out your larger blocks along the dried footing and see how many you'll need for the first layer. Don't seal these down. Fit them as close as you want. You can use different sized stones to create your preferred look, but the biggest stones must be in the bottom layers. Using too many small stones near the bottom will make your structure unstable.


Use corner blocks on the corners if available.
Don’t be discouraged by a curved wall. Many sandstone walls constructed from uneven stones can turn out curvy in certain sections. This is an aesthetic choice that can stand on its own, or be cut for a straight wall., You can purchase standard mortar from your local home improvement or hardware store. Add 3-inches (7.6 cm) of water into your cleaned out wheelbarrow, bucket, or tub. Pour 3/4 of your bag of mortar into the container. Mix the mortar and water using your hoe or a small mixer. Add the rest of your bag of mortar, and stir until the mortar is consistent.


Your mortar is ready when it has the consistency of buttercream icing.
You can also find rapid set mortar, but it will only give you about one hour to work, which is not enough time for you to complete your wall.

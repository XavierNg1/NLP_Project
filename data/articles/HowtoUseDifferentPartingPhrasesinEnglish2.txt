 "Bye" is a shortening of "goodbye" which is said to someone who is about to leave. It is a very popular and informal phrase, and it is usually used between people that are familiar, from family members and relatives to close friends.
 "Bye bye" is a cute way to say goodbye that is usually used between children, and it can also be used between adults and children, but most of the time, this phrase is not used between two adults, except when acting silly or teasing with each other.
 "Later" is a relaxed and informal parting phrase that is short for "see you later", and this parting phrase is usually used between men. An addressing of the person such as "dear" or "bro" usually comes after this phrase.
 "See you later" is used whenever you are leaving someone in person and intend on seeing him or her again at a later time. If you are having a conversation where you cannot see the person's face (such as e-mail, phone or instant messaging), "talk to you later" is more appropriate.


If you want to be more relaxed, you can even use "catch you later" as a variant of "see you later".
 This is translated to mean "have a good morning/afternoon/evening/night" or even "have a nice day/week". This is a cordial parting phrase, too.

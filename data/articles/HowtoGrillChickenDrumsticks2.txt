 Rinse 1/2 cup of fresh parsley, 1/4 cup of fresh oregano, and 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro. Remove the stems and put the leaves in a food processor. Place 2 or 3 cloves of garlic in the processor along with the herbs. Pulse the ingredients until they're chopped.You could also use 5 sprigs of fresh rosemary or sage for a different flavor., Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt, and 1/8 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes to the chopped herbs and garlic in the food processor. Pulse the mixture until it thickens into a paste.You may want to scrape down the sides of the food processor so that all the ingredients are completely combined.
 Place your chicken drumsticks in a sealable plastic bag and add the marinade. Close the plastic bag completely and rub the drumsticks so they're coated in the herb marinade. Let the chicken marinate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.Make sure to refrigerate the chicken while it marinates.
 Turn on your gas grill or heat your charcoal grill to a medium-high heat with the charcoal all placed on one side of the grill. Remove the drumsticks from the marinade in your plastic bag and place the drumsticks on the grill directly over the charcoal. Cook the drumsticks, turning them frequently for about a minute and a half.


Searing the drumsticks will give them a nice golden color on the outside.
 Use grilling tongs to move the drumsticks to the side of the grill that doesn't have charcoal. Cover the grill with the lid and let the drumsticks continue cooking until they reach 165 degrees F with a meat thermometer (anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes). Serve the drumsticks after they've cooled for a few minutes.To ensure even cooking, you can rotate and flip the drumsticks every ten minutes or so.
The juices should run clear when you insert the meat thermometer to check the temperature.

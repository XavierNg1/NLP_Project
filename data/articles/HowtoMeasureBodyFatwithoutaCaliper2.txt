 Ideally, you should measure over your bare skin, but you can wear a thin shirt if necessary. To maintain consistency, wear the same clothing every time you measure. , Wrap a flexible measuring tape around your waist, just above the crest of your hip bones. The measuring tape should feel snug and flat against your skin, but not so tight that it is uncomfortable.You may need a mirror to make sure the measuring tape is level and lies flat against your skin.
Measure in the same location every time, and try to use the same measuring tape.
 Waist circumference measurement doesn't tell you your exact percentage of body fat, but it does gives you useful relative measurements.Non-pregnant women whose waist circumference is >35 inches (89 cm), and men whose waist circumference is >40 inches (102 cm), are at increased risk of developing obesity-related conditions such as hypertension and adult-onset diabetes.
If you are not expecting to be pregnant nor gaining weight, and your waist circumference is growing, contact your doctor. You may be pregnant or experiencing a medical issue.

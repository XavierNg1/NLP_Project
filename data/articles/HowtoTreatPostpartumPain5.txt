 Take it easy for several weeks after your c-section. Your body needs time to heal. Set yourself up in bed or on the couch, and try to keep everything you need within reach. Don’t lift anything heavier than your baby for the first eight weeks., When standing and walking, stand up straight and in good posture. This will help to support your abdomen.If it feels comfortable, place a hand gently over your incision with light pressure – you may feel more secure moving around like this.
 If you move your body quickly or bear down at all, apply pressure to your incision site. This includes when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or defecate., Most pain medications you get at your pharmacy are safe during breastfeeding, but ask your doctor or pharmacist to be sure. NSAIDs, Aspirin, and acetaminophen can help improve pain while your c-section wound heals., You can breastfeed almost immediately after your c-section, but do so in specific positions to make it more comfortable. Place a pillow over your abdomen while you hold your baby. Also try the following holds, and determine which is more comfortable for you:The football hold: Hold your baby at your side and bend your elbow. Support your baby’s head with your open hand. Face them toward your breast. Rest their back on your forearm. Support your breast in your other hand, if it’s comfortable.

The side-lying hold: Lie on your side. Face your baby toward your breast and support them with one hand. Use your other hand to hold your breast and press your nipple to your baby’s mouth. When they latch, use one arm to hold the baby and your other arm to support your own head.

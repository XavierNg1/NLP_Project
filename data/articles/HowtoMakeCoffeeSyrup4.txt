 Preheat your oven to 320°F (160°C). Spread the hazelnuts out on a baking sheet and bake them for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown.


Remove the nuts from the oven and let them cool for 10 minutes.
 Transfer the nuts to a food processor and pulse them a few times. You want the hazelnuts to be in pea-sized chunks. If you don’t have a food processor, place the nuts in a clean tea towel or sealable plastic bag and roll over them with a rolling pin.
 Combine the sugar, honey, and water in a saucepan. Bring them to a boil over medium heat. Add the nuts and boil the mixture for another five minutes, stirring regularly.


Reduce the heat to medium¬-low and continue cooking for another five to 10 minutes, until the mixture reduces to about two-thirds of its original quantity.
 Remove the pan from the heat and allow the syrup to cool to room temperature, about an hour. When it’s cool enough to bottle, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer.


Transfer the syrup to a bottle and store in the refrigerator.

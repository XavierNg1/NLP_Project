 Using a putty knife, scoop out any leaves and other debris that might have gotten lodged in the gutter. Use a wire brush to scrub away any rust. If the rust won't come out completely, cut it out using aviation snips.;
, Clean gutters are not only easier to maintain and repair, but they are safer to work with.
 Working with wet gutters can be unpleasant and even dangerous. Once they've dried out, examine them for rust and check for any damage.
 Use some roofing cement and a metal repair patch to cover and seal the hole. Make sure that the patch is at least a few inches larger than the hole itself. Also, make sure that the patch's material is the same as the gutter's material.


Gutters can develop holes over time when they rust and corrode due to exposure. Thinner gutters can develop holes when falling branches or sharp objects pierce them.
 The joints in your gutter--even seamless joints--will inevitably fail over time by allowing leaks. Take the gutter pieces, line them up at the seams, and reconnect the joints.
 When you find a sagging gutter, the problem is most likely due to missing ferrules. Replace the missing ferrule with something that won't fall out as easily, like gutter screws.

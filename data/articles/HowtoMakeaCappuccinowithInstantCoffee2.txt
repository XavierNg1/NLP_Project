 While the milk heats, make your mix. Combine 1.5 teaspoons of instant coffee with ¾ to 1 tablespoon of sugar in a coffee mug. Then add ½ to ¾ teaspoon of water. Beat the mix with a spoon for about five minutes, until it turns light brown.If you have instant espresso, try substituting a ½ teaspoon of the regular coffee with a ½ teaspoon of espresso.
 Pour 1 cup (237 ml) of milk into a pot. Set the pot on a burner. Turn the burner to medium-high. Wait for it to bubble and rise.Alternately, use a microwave. If you do, keep an eye on it and remove the milk as soon as it reaches a boil.
 Pour it into your cup. Then stir to mix and work up a froth. Sprinkle some coffee granules over the froth if desired, and enjoy!

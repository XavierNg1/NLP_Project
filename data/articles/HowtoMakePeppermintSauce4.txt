 Add the sugar.
 Stir constantly until the sugar dissolves.
 Keep heating and constantly stirring, to melt the candy canes.
 Boil for about 3 to 4 minutes. The mixture will start to thicken.
 Drizzle a little over the back of a spoon. If it forms balls on a plate when dripped from the spoon, it's ready.
 Let cool in the saucepan.
 Use or store, refrigerated. Chilled syrup can be reconstituted with a quick zap in the microwave.

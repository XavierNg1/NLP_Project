 Cut along the turkey's hip joint with your knife, letting the leg slowly separate from the body of the turkey. Remove the leg completely from the joint once you view the separation.


The joint should snap free. If not, it can easily be cut with your knife. Don't be afraid to use a little force.
 Carve close to the body, especially near the turkey's back. Note the succulent orb of meat at the base of the back, called the oyster. Consume it as the cook's reward!

, An easy way to find the joint is by feeling with your finger. It should cut easily.
 Cut slices parallel to the bone. This task can be assigned to someone else to save time while you move on to carve other parts of the turkey.


Repeat this process on the other leg. On the serving platter, you may want to keep the sections together to cater to everyone's favorite part of the bird.

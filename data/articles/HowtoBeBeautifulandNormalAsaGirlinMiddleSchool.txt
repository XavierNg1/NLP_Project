Ask your parents it you can dye your hair.
 Experiment with an eyebrow brush (you can do almost anything with these) and/or an eyebrow pen.
 Be strong willed and stay focused.

 Wash every other day and wash your hair every other day also, or as often as you wish to. Soak in the bath to get really clean and then rinse yourself with clean water.

 Make up can have negative side effects to your skin. If you want to, have some mascara and concealer and maybe real light eye shadow and not more. And if you're trying to get a boy, it won't help to use a ton of make up, it can trash your real features. Let yourself shine!

Wednesday - side ponytail
Thursday - two braids and so on.


Get your desired haircut and try new styles.
 Don't act like your friend or any other popular girl.

 First you need a comfortable and well lit work area. You also should have hobby knives, a small file set, fingernail filing boards, super glue, a clean pot of water, and a paint set.;
, When miniatures are cast a release agent is applied to them. This is an oily or powdery substance that needs to be removed before you start painting. Wash with warm soapy water to clean off any mold release on the model. Let the miniature dry.
 Now using the hobby knife, trim away any mold flash. That's the extra material around the model that will make a thin line sticking to the miniature horizontally. When the two halves of the miniature are connected in the casting process, this line is often left behind. You should use your knife to remove any other irregularities on the miniature at this point. Oftentimes the extremities have points or bubbles that shouldnâ€™t be there. Use short strokes of the knife to remove the mold lines. Try not to damage the miniature, just swipe off any excess material or bubbles. The irregularities should be pretty obvious. , Some miniatures have extra parts that need to be assembled, such as a sword or shield. This can be the hardest part. Small parts like hands, small weapons, antennas and other pieces can be glued with a simple tube of superglue. Larger metal pieces may need to be pinned. Pinning requires drilling a hole in each end of the hand or wherever you are attaching the metal piece. Then you need to string a small piece of hard wire through the hole and connect the wire to the metal piece. Then glue together everything with a superglue or a two part epoxy for stronger hold.

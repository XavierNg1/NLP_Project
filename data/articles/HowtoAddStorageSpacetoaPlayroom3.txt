 This type of shelving is not only easy to put up but very affordable. You can find floating shelves in plain wood colors like oak or cherry, or in black and white. They are carried in most stores like Target, Home Depot, and Walmart. All hardware required for the shelves is included. However, you will need a drill to put in the drywall screws to make sure these shelves are secure.


Floating shelves come in many sizes but are often short and thin. Try using them for smaller toy collections like cars or action figures.
 Try devoting a whole wall to storage by putting up multiple rows of shelving. You can do this with standing or floating shelves. Just make sure you measure the height and width of the wall so you can keep the spacing between shelves even. You can also try creating a wall solely of storage bins or boxes, which would act similarly to cupboards.


If you don't have the space for a whole wall, you can still install multiple shelves in the area available.
 Use standing shelves to separate a playroom from a living or family room space, or simply between activities like reading and arts and crafts. This is a great way to separate areas while still retaining a feeling of openness. You can even divide the bookshelf between the different spaces. For example, playroom items can be placed on the lower shelves where children can reach them, while items like pictures and knick knacks can sit on the top shelves.

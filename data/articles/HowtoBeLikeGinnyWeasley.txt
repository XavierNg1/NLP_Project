 You have to make the most of what you've got, but naturally. Glow from within. For example: If you have got curly hair, don't straighten it just to look like Ginny. That isn't the kind of thing she would do.;
, Which basically means, don't let anyone tell you who you are or what to do (the latter has the exception of parents of course, this is reality). Know who you are, what you think and don't let anyone decide that for you.
 You can't let little things get to you, or scare you. It just stops you from doing the things you want to do. Stand up for what you believe in, take risks and don't forget, bravery doesn't mean never being scared, it means overcoming the things that scare you. Eventually, through doing this, you'll become nearly fearless.
 Ginny also had a lively, energetic personality. She was only ever otherwise around the early years of Harry Potter. She then grew more confidently, and more lively and energetic. She rarely cried, so like I said before, don't let the little things get to you; laugh!

, Obviously in our world (For us muggles who don't know a thing about magic), that means being good at sports. But she also kept it a secret from her family for years. So maybe sneak a bit of football/basketball/soccer/rugby... practice by yourself, and then wow your family when the occasion presents itself.
 She was able to lie or act herself out of many situations. Don't lie all the time, only when it's necessary to protect yourself or others. Don't look down, shake, sweat or stutter when lying. Instead of lying, you could practice being a good actress.
 If you have a pet, take good care of it, play with it. Love it.
 Study and get good grades, but don't turn out to be a know-it-all.

 When you don’t get enough sleep, your body releases hormones that affect you in many negative ways – including building muscle. Prioritize sleep and try to get as close to 8 hours nightly as possible.While you’re sleeping is when your body gets the rest it needs to build muscle., Putting on mass requires dedication. A great way to dedicate yourself to your workouts is to set a schedule and stick to it. Get a calendar and mark which 3 days of the week you’re going to go to the gym or workout at home.


Remember to reward yourself sometimes! Some ice cream or pizza won’t hurt you every now and then, and rewarding yourself for hard work can help you stay motivated.
 NEAT, non-exercise activity thermogenesis, is the term for all of those small daily movements and activities that may just add up as calorie-burners. Fidgeting, walking, pacing, climbing stairs – most people don’t burn many extra calories at all, but if you do these things often throughout the day, you could possibly be burning up to 2,000 extra calories daily.If you truly struggle to gain weight, pay attention to your NEAT activities – you may be able to save yourself some calories.


If you pace or fidget because you’re nervous, try relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, or a few minutes of meditation. If your extra movements are just a habit, pay closer attention and be mindful. Sit with your feet planted firmly on the ground so you don’t tap your foot or shake your leg, and otherwise focus on keeping your body still and calm.
 Accept your body, especially if you are a teenager and are still growing. When you reach adulthood your metabolism and body shape may change. Remember that muscle gain is a slow process and takes dedication and time – keep at it, and you’ll get there!

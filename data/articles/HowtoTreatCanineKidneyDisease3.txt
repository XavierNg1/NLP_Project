 Kidney disease leads to a vicious circle whereby there is less functional tissue doing more work, placing it under greater strain, which hastens its deterioration. Drugs called ACE inhibitors, such as benazepril (Benefortin), reduce the blood pressure gradient across the kidney, which reduces one of the risk factors for deterioration.


The dose is generally 0.25 to 0.5mg/kg once daily by mouth., ACE inhibitors are long term treatments with long term benefits. In severe kidney failure, the fail in local blood pressure can lead to a failure of filtration and a worsening of your dog's condition. Thus use of ACE inhibitors is reserved for dogs in the earlier stages.
 This medication was developed for cats and is not licensed for this function in dogs. However, some veterinarians will still prescribe it.

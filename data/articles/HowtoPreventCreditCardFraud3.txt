 Since your birthdate and your Social Security number are the key pieces of information used to start a new account or access an existing one, never carry your Social Security card in your wallet.


This includes other identifying documents such as your voter registration card or your birth certificate as well. Keep these documents locked up in a safe place â€“ you don't need to carry them with you., No one who contacts you needs this information. If someone claims to be from a company with which you already do business, contact the company yourself directly to confirm whether the communication was from them.
 Keep your personal information private, and avoid signing up on websites that ask for more information than is strictly required to open up your account.


For example, if a blog wants your name, address, birthdate, and Social Security number just to send you a weekly newsletter, it might be using your information for more than just a mailing list., Your identifying information also can be used to open up new credit accounts in your name, so you should review your reports regularly and dispute any unauthorized activity.If your card or account information is compromised in a store hack or data breach, you can use a security freeze to lock down your credit report. If the hacker tries to apply for a new loan or credit card, the would-be lender won't be able to see your report, which means they probably won't open a new line of credit., Destroy anything with personal information on it before you throw it away, even if it only contains your name and address. You don't want to give would-be identity thieves even a small piece of the puzzle.
 Any unsolicited communication could be a possible phishing attempt from thieves attempting to commit fraud.


If you have any questions at all, contact your bank or credit card company directly using the customer service number on the back of your card.

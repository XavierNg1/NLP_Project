 Go to your local craft store to purchase paper for your covers and the subsequent album pages. Create your covers with a decorative heavy paper. The cover sheets should be made of heavier paper like cardstock and should have distinguishing details like patterned paper.
Create the album pages with solid sheets of paper that are one color. Sheets should have measurements of 12x12.;
, Divide the 12x12 sheets evenly in half to create two sections of 6x12 pieces. On each 6x12 piece, use a ruler to measure 3 sections that are 4 inches in length. Fold the 6x12 piece against each of the three 4-inch lines and press it firmly to make the folds smooth.


Measure and cut the heavy cover pages into two 4x6 cut pieces.
 Take both of the 6x12 inch sections of paper at their short ends and secure with tape. Fold the paper up like an accordion to discern where the album’s front and back covers will be., The heavy decorative paper from earlier will act as the front and back covers of the album. Place glue at the corners and sides of the page and place them firmly at the front and back of the album pages.
 Arrange photos on the remaining open pages of the album, placing them on available sheet: front and back. Do not glue photos onto the pages. Instead use photo mount squares on each of the photo’s corners to ensure that they are secure on their respective pages.
 Make sure that the ribbon is long enough to wrap around the entire length of the album when tying it. Use super adhesive glue to secure the ribbon on the back cover of the album. Tie the ribbon’s ends into a simple bow.Use your creativity to add designs. Use a glitter marker or a gold permanent marker and fill the cover with different drawings or words that have to do with who you’re creating the album for. Add stickers to the front and back if you desire to or even additional photos.
As an added personal touch, glue a metal label holder to the front cover to write a name or date.

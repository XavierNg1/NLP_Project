 Putting the car into a lower gear will give you some extra zip when passing another vehicle on the highway, or joining traffic when there is a short ramp, without having to floor the accelerator.


When at steady speed in full auto mode, the Subaru's CVT system keeps RPMs low for fuel efficiency; pushing down the accelerator very rapidly increases torque, but the RPMs still need to build up. Downshifting raises the RPMs so when you accelerate, you don't have to wait for the RPMs to catch up.Always check your blind spot by turning your head before changing lanes.

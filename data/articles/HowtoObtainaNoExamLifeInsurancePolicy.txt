Term life insurance is set for a certain time such as 10 to 20 years. If you live past the term of the policy, it expires. This means you're no longer covered and you receive no money back. Also, you can't borrow against the policy if you need money.
Permanent life insurance, also called whole life insurance, provides a death benefit and a cash value or savings account. It isn't limited to a specific time such as 20 years. Also, you can cash in the policy at any time or borrow against it to obtain money.
Term life insurance is less expensive than permanent life insurance.;

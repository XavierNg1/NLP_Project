 Once you've turned it completely off, make sure to unplug the laptop from the wall, if it is connected. If possible, make sure to also take out the battery from the laptop, just to be safe. You don't want to be messing around with expensive electronics only to have your laptop start up and short circuit.;
, Most laptops have Phillips screw heads for the outer panel, but yours might be different depending on the manufacturer of the laptop.
 Make sure not to strip the screws, as you'll need those to put the cover(s) back on again. This is where you will find the "Guts" of your laptop.


There will be a silver casing surrounding a large part of the circuits inside. Do not touch this. It is the bare bones of the laptop and contains BIOS chips and default ram. The exposed part is what you will be looking at. The graphics card is a large chip that is coming out of the side of the casing. You will want to unscrew the card from the outside. (Screws vary with laptop)

, Write down or take a picture of which wires connect to which parts of the card. Remove these wires and put the old graphics card aside.
 Screw everything back in place.
 If there is an error, consult your hardware provider.

 Just like you would using the extractor, you want to use a hammer and a center punch to mark the center of the bolt.
 Use a bit that is roughly one-quarter the diameter of the bolt and drill it out.








This method of extraction is typically reserved for bolts that are too corroded to be removed with an extractor, so you do not need to worry as much about tightening the bolt while drilling it out with a right-handed bit, but using a left-handed bit can’t hurt.
 With any threading the bolt still has exposed, tighten a hex nut onto it. You want to attach the nut firmly, but back it off around half a turn, so that it’s not completely flush with the surface into which the bolt is embedded., This is a quick weld, but you do not want this to be your first attempt at welding. If you need to, have an experienced friend complete the weld, or you can always practice on something else first with the information found at Weld.









Be especially careful if the surface into which the broken bolt is embedded is one that will melt to the steel bolt or nut. Because of this, this method works best against a surface such as aluminum, which does not easily weld to steel.
 After the weld has had time to cool, the hex nut has essentially been welded into place as the new head of the bolt and can probably be removed with a socket or a wrench.









The weld is strong, but it will not be unbreakable. For especially corroded bolts, the nut may have to be welded back in place more than once.
In order to break the corrosion bonds, try slowly working the bolt back and forth initially. Once it starts to loosen, continue working both directions but more so counterclockwise, so you can begin removing it entirely.

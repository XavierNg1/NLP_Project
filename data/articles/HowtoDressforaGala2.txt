 Ensure that it is of high quality. A black or dark navy or grey suit may work.
 Whether you wear a tuxedo or another high quality suit, you must wear a jacket. Black wool and midnight blue are both appropriate choices unless otherwise specified in your invitation, and you can go for either a single-breasted or double-breasted cut. You may end up taking off the jacket at the after-party, but the formal jacket is considered important for a gala event.
 Your trousers should be made of the same material and shade.
 If wearing a tuxedo, make sure to pair it with a proper tuxedo shirt. With a tux rental, it comes as part of the package.
 Bow ties are a traditional, widely accepted choice for galas and other formal occasions. A black long tie may also work if made of a nice material. Some other neckwear, such as cravats, bolo ties, and such may or may not be considered appropriate for your region.
 Choose shoes made of patent or highly polished leather. "Novelty" choices such as Converse sneakers have no place at a proper gala.



Make sure your hair is clean, brushed, and kept in place.
Have a manicure and pedicure the day before. Or at the very least make sure your nails are tidy, trimmed, and clean.

 Purchase your synthetic hair from a well-respected seller such as Cyberlox or I Kick Shins. Once you have the hair, decide what length you would like your dreads to be. For beginners, it is easiest to start out with the hair folded in half, as once you backcomb you already have a loop at the top, and it will be much more secure to work with.
 Secure the hair to a piece of material that is pulled tight, as you will have to pull on it later. Backcomb the hair several times, separating as you go, until it is knotted thoroughly., Sealing is done by applying heat to your twisted dread to melt the hair into the final dread shape. This can be done with a steamer, a boiling kettle, a saucepan of water, or a standard hair straightener with a damp cloth draped over the dread, which is the preferred method. Using the straightener, start by twisting the fur-ball as tight as you possibly can, starting from the top and working your way to the end. Wet the cloth, and squeeze most of the water out. Place your preheated hair straightener over the dread and hold for 5 seconds. Continue all the way to the end of the dread. Remove the cloth and voila - your first Synthetic dread., Once you have completed your recommended amount of dreads, thread the dreads onto elastic so you can tie it around your ponytails. Usually dread falls come with two sides to be worn over two ponytails. A standard set of dreadfalls is 30 dreads per side for thin hair or those people with an undercut, or 45 dreads per side for those with thicker hair.

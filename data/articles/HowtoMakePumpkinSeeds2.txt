 To cook your own pumpkin seeds, you must start with raw seeds, and the best place to get these is a fresh pumpkin. Cut open your pumpkin by cutting off the top and quartering it, or by cutting an angled hole around the stem. Remove the seeds with a spoon.


Transfer the seeds to a colander and rinse them under running water. Pick through with your fingers to remove the stringy bits and orange flesh. Toss the seeds to remove excess water., The easiest way to toast pumpkin seeds is to cook them in a frying pan. Place a dry 10-inch skillet over medium heat and let it preheat for two to three minutes.A dry frying pan means there is no oil or other liquid in it.
 Add the pumpkin seeds to the hot frying pan and spread them out in a single layer to ensure even cooking.Cook the seeds for four to five minutes.


As the seeds cook, toss them around in the pan or stir them with a wooden spoon every minute.
The seeds are ready when they become golden brown and puff up.
 Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the warm seeds to a bowl.Drizzle in the oil, add the spices, and toss to coat. You can season the seeds with a pinch of:


Salt
Pepper
Cinnamon
Curry powder
Herbs, such as rosemary or thyme

 Open any Internet browser on your computer, and navigate to Twitter’s home page.;
, Enter your email address or Twitter handle into the first text box on the left side of the page. Enter your password into the second box, and click the login button to access your account.
 Look on the top right side of your profile page when it loads. You will see a box that says “Followers” and has the number of followers you have below it. Click on the word “Followers” and a page will load with all of your current followers.
 Scroll through your list of followers and locate those whom you think might be inactive. Click on their name and their profile will load.
 Keep in mind there are a couple of different ways you can find inactive users. Click on their profile, and you will be able to see if they have posted anything recently. Look further down the list, and you can also see if they interact with the people they follow. If you do not see any retweets, comments, or new follows, it might be time to unfollow this user.
 Click the “Following” button on the top of their profile page and you will have unfollowed an inactive user.


Repeat as many times as necessary to get all your inactive Twitter followers.

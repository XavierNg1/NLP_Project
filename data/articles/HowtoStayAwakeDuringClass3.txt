 Breakfast is definitely the most important meal of the day, especially if you are trying to stay awake during class. Eating a healthy breakfast will give you the energy to stay awake and alert so you can do your best in class. Try to aim for a breakfast that has good carbs, fiber, and protein.Try steel cut oatmeal with fruit, nuts, milk, and honey. Stay away from the prepackaged flavored kind. Greek yogurt with fruit and nuts, or an English muffin topped with almond butter and blueberries are also good choices. If you want to eat cereal, look for one with less than five grams of sugar and more than five grams of fiber.
Eggs, bananas, strawberries, cantaloupe, grapefruit, oranges, raspberries, and whole wheat bread are other good breakfast foods.
 Dehydration can cause you to be tired and lethargic. If you drink nothing throughout the school day, or if you drink a bunch of sugary sodas, you may end up dehydrated. Instead, drink water throughout the day.Get a reusable bottle to keep in your backpack and refill it at least once during the day.
 One cause of fatigue and sleepiness is low blood sugar. If you are not getting enough food throughout the day, you may start to feel groggy and want to sleep. Eat a snack that will give you energy. Avoid sugary snacks because that will cause you to crash later in the day.Find snacks with complex carbs and proteins, like nut butters with apples or bananas or granola with berries.

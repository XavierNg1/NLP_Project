 Get out a blender and measuring cups and spoons. Measure and place each of the ingredients into the blender. This makes one full batch of fake blood that you can use and eat. You'll need:1/2 cup (120 ml) of red fruit punch
1 cup (300 g) of corn syrup (or golden syrup)
2 tablespoons of red food coloring
1 tablespoon of chocolate syrup
2 tablespoons of cornstarch
1 tablespoon of cocoa powder;
, Put the lid on the blender and blitz it for about 30 seconds, so the ingredients combine and forms smooth fake blood. It may help to pause after 15 seconds and blitz the fake blood again. This will ensure that any lumps of cocoa powder or cornstarch are blended out.If you don't have a blender, you could use a large food processor.
 Remove the blender lid and dip a spoon into the fake blood to check the color. Drizzle some of the fake blood onto a white paper towel to get the best idea of the color. If you need to adjust the color, you can add more red food coloring, chocolate syrup, or cocoa powder.

For example, if the fake blood looks too pink or pale, add a few drops of red food coloring and blend it again. Or if the fake blood looks too bright red, add some more chocolate syrup or powder and blend it again.
 If you'd like thicker fake blood that's a little globby, add extra corn syrup. For extra thick fake blood, you could double the amount of corn syrup. Keep in mind that you may need to add extra red food coloring, since it will be diluted.

If you don't want to use corn syrup, you could substitute golden syrup.

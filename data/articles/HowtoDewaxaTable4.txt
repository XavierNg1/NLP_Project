 You can also place a bag of ice cubes or frozen vegetables over the wax. Getting the wax cold will harden it and make it easier to scrape off of your table., Use a dull instrument like a credit card so that you don't chip or scratch the surface of your table. Push the credit card under the wax and try to work it off the table. If it helps, break the wax up into smaller pieces to make it more manageable., Putting a cotton rag over the top of the remaining wax will protect the surface of the table from the heat that you apply to it. Lay the cloth over the portion of the table that still has wax on it., Use a hairdryer or iron and apply heat to the cloth that's lying over the wax. Go over the area with the wax in a back and forth motion, making sure not to apply heat to a single area for too long. Continue to apply heat the area that has wax for five minutes. Doing this will heat up the wax and make it easier to remove.Applying heat to one part of the table for an extended period of time can damage the finish on your table.
 Lift up the rag that you used to protect the table top to uncover the melted wax. If the wax is still solid, put the rag back down and continue heating it until it melts. You should be able to then remove the wax easily by wiping it down with a damp rag or cloth.

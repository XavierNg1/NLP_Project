 This can be a free, basic program like Paint, or a complex program like Adobe Photoshop. The end result will be the same.


Consider finding the original source of the image instead of converting the JPG. JPG files are compressed, and suffer a quality loss at the time of compression. This means that converting them to PNG will not result in a higher-quality image. In order to get the best quality, you will want to find the original source image and save it as a PNG file.;
, This will create a copy of the original file, and allows you to set a new format. Give your file a name that helps you identify that it has been converted.
 In the "Save as type" or "Format" drop-down menu, select PNG as the file format. Click Save. When you save the file, it will be turned into a PNG image.

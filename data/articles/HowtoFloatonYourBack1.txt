 To be able to float on your back without panicking, you should be calm and relaxed in the water, even if you're not an expert swimmer. You should learn how to float on your back in a swimming pool, not an ocean or a lake with waves. Ideally, you should be reasonably comfortable in water and know how to swim from one end of a pool to the other without needing any help.

If you're floating on your back as a way to learn how to swim, then you should take extra caution and be with your spotter at all times.;
, Don't try to float on your back by yourself for the first time. Even if you've mastered other basic swimming techniques, if it's your first time trying to float on your back, you should not only have a spotter, but make sure that you're in a place with a lifeguard that can come to your rescue if you need the help.


The spotter will place his hand under your back and will let you make the necessary adjustments to your body until you're comfortable trying the technique on your own.
 Using a PFD (personal flotation device) around your arms or mid-section can also make you get more comfortable in the water. If you've worked with a spotter but aren't quite ready to try floating on your back on your own, try wearing the device until you wean yourself off of it.
 Before you begin to float on your back on your own, you need to align your body with the water -- ideally, your body should start off in a position that is almost parallel to the water or bottom of the pool. You can even get on your back and kick off the side of the pool until your body naturally glides with the surface of the water.


Once your body is aligned with the surface of the water and your back is relatively parallel to the water, it'll be much easier to make adjustments to the rest of your body.

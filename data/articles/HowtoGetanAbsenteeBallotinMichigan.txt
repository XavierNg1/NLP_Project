Your signature will be checked against the signature you have on record, both to confirm that you are registered, and that you are filling out the form legitimately.
Your ballot application must be received by your local clerk no later than 2 p.m. on the Saturday prior to the election., When you receive your ballot at the address you indicated in the application, fill it out as completely as possible.
 Use the special return envelope sent to you. Be sure to put a stamp on it, then return it to your local clerk.


The local clerk must receive your absentee ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day.
Your ballot will not be counted unless the signature on your return envelope matches the signature you have on file.
If you received assistance voting on the ballot, then the signature of the person who helped you must also appear on the return envelope.
Only you, a family or household member, a mail carrier, or an election official may deliver your signed absentee voter ballot to your clerk's office.
 Do this at least 90 days before the election. If you know you'll be overseas come election day, requesting an absentee ballot each January will ensure you receive your ballot in a timely manner.


States and territories must send absentee ballots 45 days before an election.
 If you have not received your ballot 30 days before the election, contact the state election office and the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP). You might be eligible for back-up ballot. You can contact the FVAP here:On their website at http://www.fvap.gov

, Be sure to read the instructions before filling out your ballot. Then fold the ballot in such a way as to conceal your votes.
 Seal it securely, and write "USA" below the clerk's address.
 Your signature must appear on the return envelope in the designated location, or your ballot will not be counted.


If you are disabled and require assistance to mark your ballot, the person who assisted you must complete the section on the return envelope that is titled "TO BE COMPLETED ONLY IF VOTER IS ASSISTED IN VOTING BY ANOTHER PERSON."

, Place the necessary postage on the envelope, and send it via United States mail or other public postal service, express mail service, parcel post, or common carrier.

 A list of your chats will appear as soon as you launch Kik. Tap the name of the person you’re chatting with to open that chat.


If this is your first time using Kik, install the app from the App Store (iPhone) or Play Store (Android) and tap “Register” to sign up.;
, When you tap the :), the smiley tray will appear, showing all available options.
 If you’re smitten, try sending the heart or a kiss. If you’re feeling blue, choose the one that’s in tears. Be creative!


If you installed new smileys from the Smiley Store, tap the “+” sign to launch your locker. Select the smiley you want to send, and then choose the recipient.
 You can include lots of different smileys in a single chat message if you’d like. You can even add the same smiley multiple times to really drive home your point.
 If you have something else you want to say, type it before sending the message. Once the message is sent, the smiley (and any accompanying text you included) will appear in the chat.

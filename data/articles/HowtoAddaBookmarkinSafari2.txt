 Make sure that you are using the Safari app to open the site.
 This is located to the left address bar on the iPad, or the bottom of the screen on iPhone. It looks like a box with an arrow pointing upwards.
 The icon looks like an open book, and is located underneath the list of apps.
 When you tap the Bookmark icon, the pop-up window will change to the Add Bookmark window. You can change the name of the bookmark as well as the exact address.
 Click the "Location" button beneath the bookmark name to set where the bookmark will be stored. You can choose from any existing folders.
 If you want to better-organize your bookmarks, you can add new folders to your bookmark manager. Tap the Bookmarks button in the Safari browser, and then tap "Edit" in the lower-right corner of the window that pops up.


Tap "New Folder" to create a new folder for future bookmarks. You can place new folders inside of other folders by tapping the Location button when creating the folder.
 From the bookmark manager window, tap Edit like you would if you were creating a new folder. You can then move the bookmarks around by touching the move icon (three horizontal bars) next to each entry, or change the location of the bookmark by tapping it and selecting a new folder from the Location button.
 You can delete old bookmarks by opening the bookmarks manager and tapping Edit. Each bookmark will have a red icon next to the name. Tapping this icon will show the "delete" button, which will delete the bookmark when pressed.

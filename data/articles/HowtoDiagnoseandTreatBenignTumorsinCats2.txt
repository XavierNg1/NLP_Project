 If your veterinarian finds or suspects tumor growth, they will run a few tests. These tests may require the use of a diagnostic laboratory to study the cells and determine if the growth is malignant or benign. Your veterinarian may recommend that a blood test be performed to determine if a tumor is present. A thyroid tumor, for example, can be diagnosed upon examination and by reviewing your cat’s thyroid stimulating hormone levels in its blood., A fine-needle aspiration cytology describes the method in which a tumor’s cells are extracted. A needle is inserted into the tissue and a syringe uses suction to extract a tissue sample. The tissue cells are studied in a laboratory to determine if it is cancerous or not. This procedure is minimally invasive and does not require general anesthesia., When a histopathology is performed, a slice or sample of the tumor is taken, stained with dyes, and examined under a microscope. A histopathology is usually very accurate in determining if a tumor is benign. This test can usually tell a veterinarian if the tumor could grow into something malignant over time. This can help the veterinarian determine if the tumor should be removed., Biopsies are usually performed when malignancy is expected, but they can help determine whether a tumor is benign. There are multiple ways to perform a biopsy—some only need to remove a small sample of the tumor’s tissue, while others are more invasive surgical procedures where the entire tumor is removed. Afterward, the tissue will be studied in a laboratory and results will be provided in about one week.

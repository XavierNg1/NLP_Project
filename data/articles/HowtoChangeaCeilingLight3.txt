 Remove the screws that hold the ceiling light fitting in position, and lower it down until it is hanging gently on the wires.
 Hold the wires going to the light in one hand while you loosen them off from the wires protruding from the ceiling. Pass the lamp down to your friend (mind your balance!) and come down off the ladder carefully.

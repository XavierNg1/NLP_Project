, Both of these phrases refer to a person carrying an object to a location. The key to using them correctly is identifying if the motion will be to the speaker's location or not.


If the motion will be towards the speaker then the speaker should use bring. For example, while calling someone from your house about an upcoming visit: "Please bring the book you want to show me when you come to my house tomorrow."
If the motion will be to someplace other than the speaker's current location use the work "take." For example, when calling a friend about a visit you have planned at their house tomorrow: "Should I take the book I want to show you with me to your house tomorrow?" Also when the location is neither the speaker's or the listener's current location, use "take". For example: "Do you think I should take a jacket when we go hiking tomorrow?"

 If you do this you will remember better each successive time.
 It will take time to change your habits, so do not be angry with yourself if you are slow to change.

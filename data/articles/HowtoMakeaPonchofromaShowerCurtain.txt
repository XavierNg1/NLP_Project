 You can make this using a standard sewing machine, without any special attachments. See the "Things You'll Need" list below.


Switch out the needle.
Thread a bobbin.
Set your stitch length to three or higher.;
, Put the shower curtain through a cold, gentle wash cycle to remove soap scum and mold. Run it through the washing machine with small and soft items like hand towels, wash cloths, socks, etc.--The little items will "scrub" away the soap scum and residue, leaving a nicely clean plastic liner. To use less water, you can also try soaking the shower curtain in a bleach solution, then scrubbing it with a brush as needed. Hang to dry.
 Set aside the piece you cut off, you'll need it later.
, This will be the head hole.
, Look at the image for guidance, or trace a hood from an existing garment. (The folded edge is the part that goes over your head, the curve goes on the back of your head.)

, Here are some things to keep in mind when sewing the curtain:


When you feed it into the sewing machine, put a flat piece of tissue paper underneath it so that the curtain doesn't stick and stall the sewing machine.
Don't sew the same spot more than once, or else the curtain may get weak and tear.
When you're done, tear the tissue paper away.
, Pin the hood inside of the hole. It helps to carefully try it on a couple times and make sure it lays right.

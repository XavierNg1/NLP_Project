 The type of rope you purchase will depend on your experience/fitness level and how you plan to use your jump rope.


If you are a beginner jumper, then you may want to choose a cloth or beaded jump rope. These types of jump ropes turn more slowly and offer more control than PVC ropes, so they are a good choice for mastering form when you are just starting out. If you are an intermediate/fitness jumper, then you may want to choose a leather or PVC jump rope. These types of jump ropes are lightweight and they can move quickly for speed training. If you are an experienced/speed jumper, then you may want to choose a speed rope. Speed ropes are made of lightweight PVC and some speed ropes have ball bearings attached to the rope ends that help your rope turn even more quickly. ;
, You will need to buy a rope that is about 2-3 feet longer than your height. If you have trouble deciding between two lengths, go for the longer one. You are better off buying a rope that is too long than one that is too short. Remember that you can always reduce the length but you cannot add to it. , If you go to a sporting goods store, you can always ask one of the associates to help you with your purchase. They may even be able to size your jump rope for you in the store.
 Once you have decided on a rope type and size, purchase your jump rope. Depending on the type of rope you have decided to purchase, you may be able to pick one up at a local bargain store or you may have to go to a specialty sporting goods store.

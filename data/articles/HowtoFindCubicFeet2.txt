 Half the width of a circle is also known as the radius. If it doesn’t measure well into whole feet, feel free to measure it in inches for now.


Ex. 20 inches (50.8 cm) / 2 = 10 inches (25.4 cm).
 This is the same thing as the radius squared.


Ex. 10 inches (25.4 cm) x 10 inches (25.4 cm) = 100 square inches.
 If you don’t have the pi button on your calculator (or would prefer an approximation), multiply by 3.14. This gives you the two-dimensional area of the circular end of the object.


Ex. 100 inches (254.0 cm) x 3.14 = 314 square inches.
 Depending on how the cylinder is oriented, this may be its length or height. Write down this number.


Ex. 11 inches (27.9 cm).
 This gives you a three-dimensional, or cubic, measurement.


Ex: 314 square inches x 11 inches (27.9 cm) = 3454 cubic inches.
 To convert from cubic inches to cubic feet, divide the result by 1728.


Ex. 3454 cubic inches / 1728 = 2 cubic feet.

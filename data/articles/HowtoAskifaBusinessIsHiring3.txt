 Asking about open positions in person is a little different than asking in writing. You won’t have time to revise what you say, so you should prepare ahead of time. Practice what you’ll say, including your education level, experience, and why you’re interested in that company.You might not get an interview right away, but if you have this information prepared, it can go a long way toward impressing a hiring manager.
 You should dress for these types of encounters the same way you would if you were going in for an interview. The first impression is the most important, and you want the hiring manager to take you seriously. It also shows that you’d reflect well on their company, since you dressed appropriately just to ask if there are any openings., Hiring managers are usually not out on the floor of businesses or stores. Ask the nearest employee – or the receptionist if there is one – if you could speak to the hiring manager. If they ask why, explain that you’re interested in any open positions at the company., When the hiring manager comes out, act professionally. This means shaking hands, making eye contact, and being polite. Explain who you are, and why you’re there., The hiring manager may ask for your resume after they meet you. You should have at least one copy with you. If the hiring manager says there are no current openings, you can ask if you can leave your resume for future consideration.

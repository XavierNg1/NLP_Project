 Yeah, you have a uniform, but unless your school is really, really strict, that doesn’t mean you can’t slightly alter it to your liking. If you wear a polo, wear a feminine cut or tight polo. Wear skinny pants instead of regular or loose fit pants. Put on Converse, Vans, or skate shoes if the type of shoes you’re supposed to wear isn’t specified in the dress code., Studded belts are a pretty easy way to declare your style. They can be found at stores like Hot Topic. If you can’t wear a studded belt, look for a belt with a big buckle. Wear two belts if you want to take it to the next level., Wear a few bracelets, or enough to cover almost half of your arm. Just be sure you don’t wear so many that your arm feels five pounds heavier! Bangle or multi-colored rubber bracelets are great. You can also wear wristbands with your favorite brand, band, or movie logos., Whether you carry a traditional backpack or messenger bag, don’t be afraid to decorate it so that it reflects your interests. Pierce it with safety pins. Find patches that show off your favorite bands, movies, and books. This is also a good way to attract like-minded people., If you wear glasses, consider updating your frames to show off your style. Black, thick-rimmed glasses would be a good way to go. You could also choose horn-rimmed glasses. Even if you don’t need to wear glasses, you could find a pair of frames that don’t have a prescription.

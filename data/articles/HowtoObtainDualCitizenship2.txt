 Most countries in the world grant citizenship on the basis of right of blood or jus sanguinis. Under the jus sanguinis principle, you acquire one or both of your parents’ citizenship upon birth.This means that the child acquires the parents’ citizenship regardless of where she is born, and her only citizenship is the one acquired through right of blood if she is born in a country that does not practice jus soli.


For example, if you were born in the United States, but your parents are both British citizens, then you are also a British citizen.
 Find out if obtaining a second citizenship through the jus sanguinis principle of a state would require you to renounce your prior citizenship. If that is the case, you cannot become a dual citizen.


Both the United States and the United Kingdom permit dual citizenship. However, there are other countries that grant citizenship on the jus sanguinis principle and do not permit dual citizenship.Singapore, for example, practices jus sanguinis but does not allow dual citizenship., The process that you will need to follow to gain citizenship through parentage will vary by country. Check with the country’s consulate to determine what you will need to do.


For example, if you are currently an American citizen who was born to British parents, and you are under the age of 18, it is your parents who must apply on your behalf to register you as a British citizen. The application form and guidance on how to register as a British citizen in this scenario are available here.

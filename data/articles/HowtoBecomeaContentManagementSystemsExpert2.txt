 Usually, an expert should have 5 to 7 years of experience; however, since the CMS market is changing and growing rapidly, a younger person may have an advantage of being on the cutting edge of technology. Make sure your work experience shows successful work with businesses of all sizes, training clients and technical support.
 Sign up for CMS market press releases and emails, and subscribe to blogs by industry leaders. Since CMS is steadily taking over from traditional web programming, there are many new, developing programs that can quickly corner the market.
 Open source programs are created by CMS experts in their spare time, and then they are reviewed by industry peers. If you donate some time to helping improve these systems, and you get good reviews, you can use that on a resume, to show your prowess with CMS.
 A CMS expert must also be a teacher, because the advantage of CMS is that the business can easily update their database with little, or no, coding. If you cannot successfully communicate how to use CMS to others, then you will not be able to market yourself as an expert.


Be prepared to explain to clients and customers why they would choose CMS over traditional web programming. There are many reasons, including the fact that CMS is easy for employees to use and update and you don't have to contact your web developer every time you want to change something on your site.

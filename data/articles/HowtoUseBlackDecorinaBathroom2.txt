 The drama that a black bathroom can offer is most prevalent when there is a healthy amount of white to provide some striking contrast. The brighter the white the better.Further, classic white fixtures, such as the sink and tub, will not only provide great contrast to black, but will reflect light well.
Another good way to add contrast to dark walls is by painting the ceiling white. This will also help the bathroom feel cleaner and more open.
 If material costs are not a factor, consider going with black marble walls. The variously-colored veins that run through marble will add subtle and appealing contrast. Another way to add texture along with a touch of black is by staining any wood features with an ebony stain.Dark, textured materials create shadows within a 2-D surface, which imbues a room with character in class.

, A great alternative to black walls is black flooring. This is likely the best option in bathrooms do not have windows. The classic example would be black, reflective tiles, perhaps held in place with a bright white grout.Checkered white and black tiles is also popular, and for good reason - it adds both class and enjoyment to a bathroom.
 There are plenty of specific ways to add an extra splash of black to the bathroom. For instance, a dark black floor mat will look especially good on a light colored floor surrounded by black walls. If only some of your walls or your cabinets will be black, consider hanging photos in black frames.


Whatever you choose, try to feature black accessories in locations that will stand out. For instance, store folded black towels on metal or glass shelves, as opposed to hanging them in front of a black wall.

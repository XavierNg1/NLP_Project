 Although not entirely foolproof, treating your couch with a protective spray will help prevent spills from becoming permanent stains.


Some protective sprays are water based while others are a synthetic solvent. Consult your owner's manual to see what type of cleaners are safe for your couch.
Please be aware that if the couch is brand-new that applying fabric/upholstery protector may void the warranty. .;
, Fumes emitted from the aerosol spray can be harmful in many ways and should always be avoided as much as possible.


Be sure to open all windows and use as many fans as available.
Painter's ventilator-masks can also be used.
 This will keep the over-spray to a minimum and allow you to breathe easier.


Be sure to keep the can approximately 8-12 inches away from the area being sprayed. Closer may result in 'running,' while too far away will result in an uneven coat.
Sweep, do not point, the spray can smoothly. If sweeping from left-to-right, begin spraying about six-inches to the left of couch, and stop spraying six-inches after you have passed the right edge., You will need to apply two-three coats of fabric/upholstery protector for it to work properly.

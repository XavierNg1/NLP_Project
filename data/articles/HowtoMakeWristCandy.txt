, Measure and cut two pieces of the waxed linen cord into 25 inch (63.5cm) and 18” (46cm) strands.

Fold the 25 inch strand in half, and match one end of the 18” strand with both ends of the 25” strand.
Fold the rest of the 18” strand over the folded part of the 25” strand creating two loops.
 Tie a basic overhand knot about a half-inch (1.5cm) down, leaving enough space for the toggle closure to fit through the loops.

This will leave you will 4 strands.


You should now have 3 equal strands left for braiding.


Continue the braid about an inch (2.5cm) down from the loop. Make sure you keep the braid tight, to prevent unraveling later.
If you do not know how to braid, see How to braid or How to braid a bracelet and teach yourself.
 Thread a bead onto the outer left strand.

Thread the bead and push against the base of the braid. Then cross the left strand over the middle.






Do the same but with the right strand this time. Thread the bead onto the outer right strand, push against the base of the braid, and cross over the middle.
 Rotate between the outer right and outer left strands.

Thread the beads before crossing the strands over the middle.






Complete braiding the beads in.
 Leave a tail of about another inch (2.5cm) or so of braided cord.

Measure against the wrist to ensure the bracelet isn’t too small or too big, then secure with an overhand knot.






Trim the two shortest strands completely off.


Butt it up against the braided section, then secure with another overhand knot.






Trim any excess cording. Be careful not to cut the knot.
 Layer them on with a statement piece of jewelry (something more expensive to jazz the look up). Use different color cording and beads to make the look even more fun and interesting. You’ve now created "wrist candy" on a budget!

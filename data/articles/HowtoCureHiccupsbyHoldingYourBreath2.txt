 Use a lunch-bag sized bag. Paper grocery bags will be too big. The bag should be clean, since you'll be breathing in and out of it.
 Breathe down into your belly, so that you fill up your lungs. Once you've taken the biggest breath possible, close your mouth.When you take a very deep breath, your stomach will likely expand. This is normal.
Make sure you don't accidentally breathe in or out through your mouth while you try to hold your breath.
 Place your mouth inside the paper bag. Hold the paper bag up to your face. Breathe all of the air into the paper bag, so that it blows up like a balloon.Don’t put the paper bag over your head.
Blowing into the paper bag may raise the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in your blood. This inhibits the spasms that cause hiccups.
 Breathe the air back in from the paper bag. Fill up your lungs with air. The bag will crumple and empty.


When you’ve breathed in as much as you can, hold your breath for a few seconds.
 Breathe the air back into the paper bag. The bag will blow up again. Try to fill the bag completely with air.
 Wait 30 seconds to see if another hiccup comes. If it doesn’t, you’ve cured your hiccups! If the cure didn’t work, you can repeat as necessary.


If another hiccup comes, you can begin the process again immediately. You don't need to wait 30 seconds.

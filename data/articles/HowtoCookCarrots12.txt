 Add 1 teaspoon granulated sugar and 15g/1/2 oz butter or oil to the water too.
 Retain a little of the cooking water for reuse.
, Add a few spoonfuls of the cooking liquid to the puréed carrot and stir through; this only needs to be done if the purée appears too thick to you.
 Mix well.
 This is a good addition for a meal with roasted vegetables and meat.


To make it creamier, add 4 tablespoons of double/heavy cream and stir through before serving.

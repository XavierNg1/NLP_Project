 Select a color of tissue paper for your rose's petals. You may use natural rose colors, such as red, pink, white, orange, yellow, and lavender.Instead, you may get creative and use other colors or even patterned paper. Black roses can look both elegant and morbid if you're decorating for a Halloween party. When making open roses, you may use multiple colors in one "flower" to make a rainbow.;
, Using scissors, cut out eight round pieces of tissue paper roughly the same size.Don't try to make the pieces perfect circles, as roses are not spheres. The pieces may be any size, just keep in mind that their diameter will be roughly half the width of the finished rose.
 This will make the petals look more realistic. Stack the petals on top of one another. Place the bottom end of a pen on top of the petals. Curl the pieces around the pen and move the pen up and down and side to side., Separate out the stack of petals. Take the first petal and twist it tightly into a cone shape. Wrap a second petal into a cone around the first petal starting roughly one centimeter below its top. Repeat this with three more petals. For the final three petals, wrap only about a quarter of each petal into the cone and leave the rest flat. These bottom petals should encircle the entire rose.
 Cut a roughly 10 centimeter piece of thin-gauge wire. Wrap the wire underneath the rose where the petals twist together. Fluff the bottom petals over the wire to disguise it.

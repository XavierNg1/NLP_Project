 Use a clean dry washcloth and add a few drops of hydrogen peroxide to the cloth. You want the cloth to be slightly damp, but not dripping wet., Do not rub the leather with the hydrogen peroxide. This may actually spread the stain, making it harder to clean.
 The hydrogen peroxide will react with the blood and create tiny bubbles. The blood should be lifted from the fabric through the bubbles. Wipe away the bubbles using a dry washcloth., Once you have removed the bubbles from the fabric, use a dry and clean cloth to blot up any excess hydrogen peroxide that may remain on the leather.

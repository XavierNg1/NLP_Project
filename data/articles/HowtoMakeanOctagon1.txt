 Since the size of the angles in a regular polygon is set, the only thing you'll need to decide on is the size of the octagon's sides. The larger the length of the octagon's sides, the larger the octagon itself. Make a decision based on the amount of room you have to draw in.;
, This will be the first of the eight sides of the octagon. Draw your line in a spot that leaves plenty of space for the rest of the sides.
 At either end of your line, find and mark the 135o angle. Draw a line of the same length as the first line angled 135 degrees to the original line. This we be the second side of the octagon.


Note that the lines should meet at their end points. Don't start the new line in the center of the old line, for instance.
 Follow this pattern, drawing lines of the same length that meet at 135o angles. Repeat these steps until you have created a complete regular octagon.


Because of minor, accumulating human errors in the preciseness of your drawing, the very last side you draw may not lie exactly 135o to the original line. Usually, if you've drawn carefully, it's acceptable to use a ruler to simply connect the end of the seventh side to the beginning of the first.

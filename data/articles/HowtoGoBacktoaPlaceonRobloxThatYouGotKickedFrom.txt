 A player usually says "Kick " or "Kick/" to kick a person. Rather than hating on them, let them attempt to start a "kick vote" so that they will be surprised when you show up unkicked.;
, If you don't want to, then there is no point in reading this article. You will know you get kicked when a SmartAlec statement such as "You caught No Torso-itis" or "Your limbs are beginning to fall" in the top corner of the screen,or your character will disappear into the air,allowing you to still move your camera,but not play. You will also repeatedly die and then respawn and then die again to inform you that you have been kicked.
 Once you get kicked, you're going to want to quickly "X" out of the game so that it still still lists you in the server for a short period of time.
 You should still have plenty of time to rejoin the game, even if it is full. This time, you won't be kicked!

, Yep, you bet! Go back in the game and startle everyone who is still astonished and thinks that you got kicked. They will attempt to kick you, but the kick script doesn't usually work for the same person over and over again on the same server, so you can wreak havoc on everyone who said the evil words, "Kick " and called you a n00b.Happy trolling/non-kick!

 With the shemagh completely open, match one corner with the corner diagonally opposite from it, folding the square in half and into a triangle.


This style is not necessarily the most practical, nor is it especially traditional, but it can be a casual and trendy way to wear a shemagh.
 The folded edge of the shemagh should cover your nose and mouth. Two corners should appear on either side of your face, and the other corner should drape down in front of your face and over the top part of your neck and chest.
 Bring the short ends over your shoulders and around the back of your neck. Tie them in place.









As you bring the shemagh around your neck, hold the ends up to keep the material taut against your face.
Tie a single knot at the back of your neck. The knot should be tight enough to hold the shemagh in place but not so tight that you have difficulty breathing or turning your head.
 Bring the left and right ends of the tied shemagh back over your shoulders so that they drape down loosely over your chest. You do not need to tuck them in or hide them.
 Gently tug on the top part of the shemagh so that the portion covering your nose and mouth is re-positioned to rest just below your chin and around your neck.









This step marks the end of this particular method.

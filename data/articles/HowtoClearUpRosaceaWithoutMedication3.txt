 Since rosacea has inflammatory components, following an anti-inflammatory diet can be beneficial. The anti-inflammatory diet emphasizes whole foods, preferably organic foods if possible. It also avoids all preservatives and additives.Some foods that are known as “anti-inflammatory” include salmon (with omega-3 fats), spinach. garlic, whole grains, beans and legumes, berries (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, gooseberries, blackberries), fruit and fresh vegetables like kale, collard greens, spinach and broccoli.
Avoid all processed and prepared foods, sugar and sugar substitutes, and red meat (unless it is grass-fed).
 Increase the number of fruits and vegetables so that they constitute about half your food. Include a variety of fruits, berries, nuts and seeds. Make sure to include a variety of vegetables, especially leafy green vegetables such as Swiss chard, spinach, mustard greens, broccoli, Brussel sprouts and field greens.
 Hot beverages, alcohol, coffee and hot spicy foods can open up the blood vessels and cause flushing. Avoid them to reduce redness in your skin.
 Many supplements boost your body’s natural abilities to fight inflammation, strengthen your blood vessels, and provide other benefits to your skin. Consider increasing your intake of the following supplements:


Riboflavin: B vitamins will correct a deficiency that can occur in people with rosacea. It can help the growth of skin cells.Pancreatin (8-10× USP): Take 350 to 500 mg before meals. Pancreatin is a digestive enzyme that may decrease inflammation.Zinc: Take 60 to 75 milligrams of zinc every day. Be careful, however. Do NOT take this amount of zinc for over three months. High zinc levels can be toxic. Or, you can try topical zinc. This can be used as a 15% azelaic acid gel, which is a natural acid that can help treat rosacea. Talk with your healthcare provider about using azelaic acid.
Vitamin C: Take 500 milligrams of vitamin C every day to help strengthen blood vessels.

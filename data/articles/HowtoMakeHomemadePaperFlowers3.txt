 Fold a round, paper coffee filter into eighths by folding it in half 3 times. Fold 7 filters in this way.
 You'll also want to fold 2 coffee filters a bit differently. Fold these in half twice but then, instead of doing that again, do the final fold into thirds.
 Using scissors, cut the eighths triangles so that the top, wide end becomes rounded. This forms your basic petal shape. Cut one and then use it as a pattern to cut the rest. When they're done, unfold them into semi circles and cut the semicircle in half. Set aside the petals that were folded into thirds at the end, as these will form the center of your rose.
 Starting with the petals that were folded into thirds, take one set at a time and fold up the bottom point. Glue from this folded up point to whatever you decide to use as a stem, wrapping it around the stem. Add on the rest of the petals the same, way, being sure to stagger them and alternate where they start.


You can make a stem out of a green pen, a thick wire, green pipe cleaners, or even buy fake stems from an art supply store.
 When you are done with the thirds-petals, move on to the rest of the petals. They should also be folded up at the bottom, glued, and wrapped around the other petals. Do not forget to stagger them. Keep adding petals until your rose looks full.
 When the rose is done, you might want to add a few finishing touches. You can finish off the base by gluing green tissue paper around the bottom of the flower or you can even curl the edges of the petals using a pencil.

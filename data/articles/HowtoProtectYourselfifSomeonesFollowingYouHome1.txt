 You might be able to lose the person who is following you by stopping several times at places the person wouldn’t expect you to stop. The key is to avoid the normal route you’d take home and to make your trip home as complicated as possible.Stop to get a cup of coffee or a soft drink somewhere.
Visit a friend who is working.
Run an errand at a major retail store.;
, By driving or walking in an area with a lot of people, you may be able to lose the person. In addition, the person may be less likely to hurt or rob you in front of other people.Focus on streets with lots of pedestrian or car traffic.
Consider walking into a food court, major retail store, or some sort of entertainment event.
 Whatever you do, don’t go home if you suspect someone is following you. The person could use that opportunity to corner you while you’re trying to get into your home. In addition, they might come back later and try to break in. As a result, don’t go home until you’re completely sure that they’re no longer following you.Go to a public place instead of going home.
 Get in contact with friends. Plan to meet with a group of them as soon as you can. Your friends will not only make you feel safe, but by being in a group, you'll stand a much better chance of losing the person who is following you.

Ask your friends to meet you in a public area, like on the street, in a bar, or in a restaurant.

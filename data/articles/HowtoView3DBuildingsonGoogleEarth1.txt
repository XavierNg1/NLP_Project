 Once launched, you will see a beautiful 3D rendition of the world.;
, Tick the checkbox for 3D Buildings in the Layers panel, located at the bottom left corner. This will enable 3D rendering for your results.
 Use the search box on the upper left corner and enter the address of the building you want to view. Click the “Search” button beside the search field to continue.


Just like in Google Maps, Google Earth will bring you to the location you’ve entered. At first, the area view may be too far up to be able to focus on the building.
 At first glance, you may not see the navigation area on the right of the map. Hover over it and it will appear clearly. You will see some navigation buttons to help you move around the map.
 Before you can view the building, you have to focus on it first. Use the navigation buttons and arrows to move around the map. Stop when you reach the building.
 Once you’ve reached the view you want, you can now use the vertical navigation bar to zoom in for a closer look. Click the plus button at the top of the bar to zoom in. The map will immediately adjust as you zoom in.


Continue to zoom in until you’re at the level of detail of the building you want to see.
 Wait a few moments for the building to focus. Once it’s done, you can see the building very clearly and vividly, as if you’re hovering over and around it. You can again use the navigation buttons to move around the building to see if from every angle.

 The most important thing to remember is when you are returning a bow.
 You should bow at least as low as, though preferably slightly lower than the one who bowed first. Bowing lower is a sign of respect, so try to bow lower than the person giving the bow if they are of higher social status than you, or if you don't know that person.

Greeting bows are generally 15 degrees for people you are familiar with and 30 degrees for people you just met or are of higher social standing. 45 degree bows are usually not used for greetings, unless you're meeting the emperor or Prime Minister.
If you're bowing in greeting to a good friend, you can simply nod your head to bow. This is the most casual of bows.
 Make sure to bow from the waist. Bowing with just your head or shoulders is very casual and can be seen as rude.

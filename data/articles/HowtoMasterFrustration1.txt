 Frustration results from problems and obstacles in your life. To master your frustration, you will need to first separate your problems. This will allow you to deal with each problem one at a time. When you devote all of your resources into fixing one problem, you will be much more effective than if you try to solve all of your issues at once.For example, if you are frustrated because you want to be healthier, you might need to break that idea down to specific problems. Some common issues around health are things like:

Snacking too much at the office
Drinking sugary drinks at home
Avoiding exercise during the week
Staying up too late on weekends

, Your problems and obstacles will come from various parts of your life and cause frustration. You may encounter obstacles at work, in a hobby, in school, or with your emotions. Grouping these problems into similar categories will help you identify where you experience the most frustration. Once you have identified the source of your frustrations, you can start eliminating the stressors in that environment.Being upset about a divorce is a common example of an emotional problem.
Examples of work problems could be working too few or too many hours.
 The first step to mastering frustrations is to know what would be less frustrating than your current situation. Spend time thinking about what life would look like with less frustration. This will give you a goal to strive towards. Write down as much as can to define this ideal scenario for yourself.

For example, you might envision being able to relax every evening after work. This would indicate that you should work less overtime.

 You don't need to count out the cards. Simply put the halves of the deck next to each other on the table and ensure they are the same height.









There should be 26 cards in each deck (27 if you left the two jokers in).
 Get the deck as firm as you can by turning them perpendicular and pressing them together so that you have both half of the decks with straight, solid ends. You'll be pressing the short sides of the decks together.
 You'll line up the bottom left corner of one deck with the upper right corner of the other. Press these corners together lightly. You should see the cards starting to "weave."








, This part takes some practice, but you'll get it perfectly with some time to find the motion. You want the cards to start weaving together so that the cards alternate.









Don't worry about a perfect Faro Shuffle just yet, where the cards are perfectly alternating. For now, work on the motion. You'll clean it up later.
 The back and forth motion, while light, will help you work the cards in between each other. With some practice you can also use it to "clean up" your shuffle, mixing up any chunks of unshuffled cards.

 Choose a piece of colored fondant for your nail polish bottle and roll it into a ball. You can use any color you like. For example, if you want a bottle of pink nail polish, then use a piece of pink fondant. If you want a bottle of yellow nail polish, then use a piece of yellow fondant.








You can use an actual nail polish bottle as a model for your nail polish bottle and to help you get the size right.
 Next, you will need to create a piece of fondant for the top of the nail polish bottle. These are usually black, so use a piece of black fondant and shape it into a cone.








Make sure that the cone piece is scaled to fit the ball piece.
Check the size of the cone piece against your bottle as well.
 After you have shaped your cone. You can cut off the top and bottom of the cone to give the piece a cleaner appearance. Then stick the cone onto the ball piece with a drop or two of water.








Set aside the nail polish bottle to dry.
 If you want your nail polish bottle to look shiny, then you can use a small food safe brush to apply a thin layer of shortening to the bottle.This should give your nail polish bottle a light sheen so that it will look like shiny nail polish when the light hits it.

 Spray one 9 x 13-inch (33 x 23 cm) baking dish with cooking spray. You may even want to line the pan with foil so that it's easier to lift the fudge out of the pan.Choose a butter-flavored cooking spray so you don't notice the taste of the spray on the fudge.
 Get out a large saucepan or stock pot and place 8 tablespoons (113 g) of butter, 4 cups (800 g) of sugar, 1 12-ounce (354 ml) can of evaporated milk, and 2 tablespoons of instant espresso powder in it. Bring the fudge mixture to a boil over medium heat. Boil and stir the fudge for 10 minutes.It's important to stir the boiling fudge since this will help the sugar dissolve.
The instant espresso won't add a noticeable coffee flavor to the fudge. It will just add a rich flavor to the fudge. Feel free to omit it, if you're limiting your caffeine intake.
 Turn off the heat and stir in 1 12-ounce (350 g) package of semisweet chocolate chips and 30 large marshmallows. Keep stirring the fudge mixture until the chocolate chips and marshmallows melt completely.If the chocolate chips and marshmallows don't melt all the way, place the pan back on the stove and finish melting them over low heat.
 Spread the fudge in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle 3/4 cup (170 g) of toffee baking chips or chopped toffee bars evenly over the top of the fudge and use the back of a spoon to lightly press the toffee down into the fudge. Refrigerate the toffee fudge until it hardens.It should take 3 to 4 hours for the pan of fudge to set. You can cut it into 1-inch (2.5 cm) squares.

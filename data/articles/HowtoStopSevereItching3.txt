 When you experience an itch, your natural reaction is usually to scratch it. This, however, often further irritates the skin and can make the itch even worse. Break the itching cycle by resisting the urge to scratch.
 Washing your skin with an antiseptic solution or soap can help remove anything that might be irritating your skin, soothe areas that already itch, and limit the chances that itchiness will spread to other parts of your body.
 Using skin-friendly antiperspirant, antifungal powders, and anti-itch creams or lotions can help keep your skin from becoming either too dry or too moist, both of which can lead to irritation and itchiness.
 Loose, smoothly textured clothing—especially clothes made from cotton—can help you avoid further irritation by minimizing the amount of friction on your skin. Wearing clean clothes can also help keep your skin from coming into contact with itch-inducing irritants or germs.
 Some of the most common allergens associated with itchy skin that would be good to avoid are:


Nickel or nickel alloys commonly found in jewelry
Harsh soaps and scented detergents, including some laundry detergents
Strong perfumes or fragrances
Cosmetics such as shampoo, nail polish, or sunscreen that contain harsh chemicals
Industrial products like polish, paint, and wax
Topical creams or medications that irritate your skin

, Stress can both create and worsen severe itchiness. Here are some basic tips that could help reduce the stress associated with itchy skin:


Identify which activities in your daily life tend to produce the most stress and strategize how best to tackle them each day.
Prioritize your daily tasks so you can use your energy and time as efficiently as possible.
Schedule time for enjoyable and recreational activities.
Eat healthy, well-balanced meals.
Get enough sleep.

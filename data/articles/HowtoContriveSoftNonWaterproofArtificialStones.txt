 Using any flat object with a suitably sharp edge (such as a metal ruler), rub the chalk across the edge to produce a fine grained powder. Break a piece of chalk off and cleave it into small pieces.;
, More chalk would make the resultant rock harder and brittle, while more baby powder would make the rock softer.
 Convert it to slip by dissolving it in water. Now you should have obtained a thick milky white liquid.
 Remember that the colour of the stone would lighten dramatically when dry.
 Knead the mixture. If the mixture is crumbly, add more slip. If its too watery, leave the mixture to dry for some time.
 Avoid direct sunlight and extreme heat as it would cause the mixture to crack.
, Initially, the rock would be worn downed and powder would be produced. However, as time passes, the powder would be compacted into the paper's pores to form a smooth, shiny surface. At around the same time, the rock's surface would start to darken and shine too.
 Ideally you will water down the paint with water at a ratio of three parts water to one part pain and apply the mixture with a spray bottle. Light layers of different colors with time to dry between each layer will create an exact likeness to real granite.

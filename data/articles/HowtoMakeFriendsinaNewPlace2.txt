 Many cultural organizations will arrange festivals or celebrations that take place at the same time as their home-country's traditional celebration. For example, you might attend Chinese New Year, which happens in late January/early February, and meet new people there. Other cultural activities that you might want to look into:Dia de los Muertos, the Mexican day of the dead (Oct. 31).Tanabata (七夕), the Japanese star festival (July/August).Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights (Oct./Nov.)., Even if you don't know a single soul where you're currently at, you should be able to find a Facebook page or Twitter feed that can give you ideas for events to attend. Look through the pages and feeds of friends, mutual acquaintances, and local organizations too, like museums and restaurants.Write down or put events into your cell phone calendar so you don't forget and have something to look forward to.
Invite along any new potential friends to come with you to these events, like your classmates, coworkers, or neighbors.
 Many sites now aim to connect people who have similar interests in real life. You can search for board game nights, connect with local computer/video gamers, or even meet up with others who share your passion, like writing. Some sites you might want to check out:Grubwithus

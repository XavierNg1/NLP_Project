 Calcium sulfate, also known as gypsum, is useful for breaking up pond sludge that accumulates at the bottom of the pond. Sprinkle the calcium sulfate evenly across the surface of the pond at a concentration of 525 pounds per acre-foot of water.Calcium sulfate is readily available at most gardening centers.
Calcium sulfate will not harm your fish or pond plants.
 With moving water, your pond will be less likely to accrue algae and grime. You could add a fountain or waterfall to your pond. With either fixture, ensure it is placed next to the pond so that water will return to it. Fountains could be placed in the middle of the pond if the pondâ€™s depth does not exceed the height of the fountain.


If you install a fountain or waterfall less than three feet high, the pump should be located next to the waterfall on the ground level. If you install a waterfall five feet tall or taller, the filter should be placed just behind the waterfall at an elevation equal to its highest point., The light kills suspended algae (but not string algae) in the water and allows you to easily remove any algae detritus.


UV clarifiers can be attached to either mechanical or biological filters.
UV light is harmful to human eyes, so the UV bulb will be situated within a case. Do not disassemble or remove the case from the UV clarifier.
A clarifier with 8-10 watts of UV light is appropriate for 1,000 gallons of water.

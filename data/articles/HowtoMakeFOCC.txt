 The process of this is called emulsification. Using a blender, or stick blender if you have one, thoroughly blend your cottage cheese. Add the honey and flax oil to this as well to mix it all together.


Even when it looks like it is mixed together enough, check to see if it is sticking to the sides of the container. If the process isn't complete, (it needs to blend more), then the mixture will not be sticking to the sides of the container.;
, The fresher the flax is the better.
 Sprinkle the ground flax onto the mixture.

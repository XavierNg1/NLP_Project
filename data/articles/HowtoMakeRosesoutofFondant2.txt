 Place a seed-shaped ball of fondant at the end of a skewer or toothpick to help you form the flower around it. The height of the seed determines the rough height of the rose.
 With a small ball of fondant, form a thin petal, in an egg shape with a sharp, pinched point at the narrow end.
 The more petals you have, the fuller your rose will be, but how many you should make will probably depend on the size. Actual roses have between 5-40 petals.
 Place a petal on a clean, food-safe sponge or piece of foam. Use a ball tool, a pea-sized ball bearing, or the cup of a 1/2 teaspoon measure (assuming it is a basic round) to round out the petal. Rub it in a circle at the center to form the cup of the petal shape and then rub it at the edges to make the very edge thinner than the rest of the petal.


Do not worry about keeping the edge of the petal perfectly straight or even, as real petals are curled and uneven normally.
If the fondant sticks to your tool or surface, use wax paper or saran wrap.
You can also do these same formations with only your finger, if you do not have any tools.
 Place the first petal so that the pinched base is at the base of the center you formed earlier. Carefully wrap the petal around the center. Add on the next petal, with the pinched base slightly to the side of where the first one was placed. Wrap that petal and continue on to the next. Continue in this fashion until the rose is to desired fullness. As you go, the petal should become less tightly wrapped and should begin to pull away from the center of the flower at the top.
 Once all of the petals are on, smooth out and shape the base until it looks how you want it to look. Slide it off of the skewer or toothpick.
 You can use food paint, edible glitter, or even other fondant to add various finishing touches to your rose. Consider adding fondant leaves or try dried grape leaves. Enjoy your fondant rose!

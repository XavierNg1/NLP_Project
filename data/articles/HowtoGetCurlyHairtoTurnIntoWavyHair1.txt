 If you want your hair to have very loose, flowing waves, you'll need to apply some heat. After taking a shower and patting your hair dry, move to the bedroom (where it's less humid, since humid air leads to frizz) and gather all the equipment you need before you get started:


Heat protectant product.
Medium sized hot rollers. Get rollers that are at least 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide for loose, glossy waves, rather than curls.
A hair dryer.;
, Plug in your kit and let the rollers heat up while you get your hair ready.
 Heat protectant is a product available in the hair section of drugstores and beauty supply stores. It protects your hair from getting damaged by heat styling tools. Since you're going to use both hot rollers and a hair dryer, it's important to protect your hair.Skipping this can lead to hair damage, especially to curly hair. If you don't have heat protectant, apply some hair serum or even leave-in conditioner.
 You need two side sections, a top section, and a back section, so use your hands to divide your hair. You'll be starting with the side sections, so pull back the top and back sections into hair clips.
 Lift up the top layer of the right section of your hair so you have a small handful of hair. Comb it out straight, then place the tips of the hair over the top of a hot roller. Use your hands to roll the hair over the roller, and keep going until the roller is against your head. Pin it in place using a roller pin.


Keep the hair you're rolling up as smooth as possible as you roll by rolling the hair very tightly.
Make sure you don't overcrowd the roller. The section of hair should fit neatly on the roller.
 Lift up the bottom layer of the right section of your hair so you have a small handful of hair. Comb it out straight, then place the tips of the hair over the top of a hot roller.

 Blow it over your rolled up hair from a few inches away to help your hair dry faster. Move the dryer around your head to evenly dry your hair from all angles. Keep going until your hair feels completely dry to the touch. If you take it down before it's dry, it'll curl back up.
 Unpin the rollers and let your waves loose. Use a wide-toothed comb to style your hair the way you want, and use medium-hold hair spray to hold the look in place.

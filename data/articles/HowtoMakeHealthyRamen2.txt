 Healthy kimchi ramen is a Korean style ramen that is flavored by the spicy and sweetly sour taste of kimchi. Begin preparing this ramen by chopping the green onions on the round into ½ inch (1.26 cm) pieces. Measure out 3/4 cup (180 ml) of kimchi, then slice any particularly large chunks of kimchi into pieces that are about 1 ½ inches (3.81 cm) by 1 inch (2.54 cm)., Place two whole eggs (including shell) in a medium sized pot and add enough water to cover the eggs by 1 inch (2.54 cm). Place the pot on medium heat until the water reaches a boil. Then take the pot off the heat and let the eggs sit in the hot water for 7 minutes. After 7 minutes, take the eggs out of the water using tongs or a large spoon and let the eggs cool.


Once the eggs have cooled, peel the shells off the eggs and cut the two eggs in half.
Soft boiled eggs are a traditional addition to ramen, and are preferable to hard boiled eggs because their runny yolks add flavor and thickness to the broth.
 Place the chicken stock, ½ cup (118.29 ml) kimchi, white miso and soy sauce in a large pot. Mix the ingredients together, then place the pot on medium heat and bring the broth to a boil., Once the broth has reached a boil, add the ramen noodles and cook according to the packaging, about five minutes, until the noodles are soft., After the noodles have finished cooking, use a ladle to divide the noodles and broth between the bowls you will serve it in. Then garnish each bowl with one egg half, a handful of scallions and more kimchi. Serve immediately while the ramen is hot!

 If you find yourself without any professionally-made de-icers handy, go with rubbing alcohol, which is arguably the most effective substitute (and risk-free as far as damaging your car goes).Mix one part water with two parts alcohol, fill a spray bottle with that, and use it just like you would with a store-bought spray can.If you’re really in a pinch, you can also mix the same ratio of water with hard liquor instead., If you don’t have any alcohol on hand, try distilled white vinegar instead. Combine one part water with three parts vinegar. Then fill your spray bottle and go to work on that ice. Just be aware that:This solution may not be as effective as the alcohol. It could require more elbow grease and repeated applications.Vinegar can potentially damage the glass, as well as your car’s paint if they come into contact.
 Once you get the ice off, try to remove as much of your homemade solution as possible. Start your car and give your windshield a squirt of wiper fluid. Then run the wipers to remove both that and the solution so it doesn’t linger and potentially ruin the glass.

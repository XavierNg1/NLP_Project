 It is generally recommended to avoid salty foods because of their association with high blood pressure, which can cause tinnitus. , A reasonable recommendation is to eat a healthy, whole-foods diet low in added salt, sugar and saturated fats and to increase the amounts of fruit and vegetables in the diet., Some of the most common triggers for tinnitus include coffee, alcohol, and nicotine.Avoid any and all of these as much as possible. We donâ€™t really know why these are triggers for different people. Because tinnitus is a symptom of a number of different possible problems, the reason these are triggers may vary on an individual basis.


Cutting out these substances may not improve your tinnitus. In fact, one study showed that caffeine was not associated with tinnitus at all. Another study indicated that alcohol may actually help relieve tinnitus in older adults. At a minimum, watch what happens if you have any coffee, alcohol or nicotine, especially being aware of what happens to your tinnitus after you indulge in any of these. If the tinnitus gets worse or harder to deal with, you may want to consider avoiding those triggers completely.

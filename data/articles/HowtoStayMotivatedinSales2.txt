 Strategize how to turn a lower sales count into a more personalized process, or use the time you spend caught in traffic coming up with a fun new way to pitch something. Make it your mission to always find the positive.
 If a sale falls through, don't bad-mouth the company; make it your goal to move past it to a new opportunity. Avoid saying the word "hate," or similar words and you may start to feel more positive about the sales process.
 Remember that salespeople often have better chances for income growth, better social skills, excellent opportunities for advancement and regular incentives. Remind yourself about the positive aspects of your chosen trade regularly.
 Athletic trainers recommend that athletes do periods of hard work followed by periods of lower intensity. Take a cue from this and schedule an hour for cold calling, followed by an hour of admin.


Stick to your schedule, with at least 4 periods of intense activity per day. It is better to devote 1 hour to calling, 1 hour to emails, 1 hour for cold calling, 1 hour for research, etc. than it is to mix all of those activities. Studies have shown that multitasking results in lower levels of performance for many people.

 Is your place a complete pigsty? What exactly will that say about you? Are you a messy person? Are you unorganized and unkempt? Are you uncaring about the impressions you make? Take the time to clean up. If your place is small, put things in boxes then cover the boxes with a large tablecloth. Cover that with a plate and then put on the plate a trio of candles. There are always ways to disguise your messes.;
, More than 50% of guests tend to check the contents of your cabinets when you aren't looking. Clean it up and toss all aged or corroded items.
 Also, the night before, use Febreze or other deodorizer on all fabric surfaces.
 If you are, clean all ashtrays out thoroughly and empty all trash containers. Spies learn a lot about people through their trash, but so can your prospective date. Aside from making it look clean, this has the added benefit of smelling less.
 Fresh sheets that are freshly cleaned say that you are ready for anything and that you enjoy that slip into the sheets feeling when everything is clean.
 Spots on your carpet leave the worst impression. Vacuuming can reduce dust mites as well and this can help when your prospective date may have allergies.
 This makes the pets less likely to feel uncomfortable and get used to the new smell of a new someone and it also allows you time to explain to your date about your menagerie.
 Pair your food with something appropriate to drink. Pick at least 2 drink options to offer to your guest besides water. Wine, juice, tea, beer and lemonade are possible suggestions.
 Music, soft and quiet, can soothe or lull your guest into submission whether they like what they see or not.
 Front hallway, bedroom and bathrooms are the most likely rooms.

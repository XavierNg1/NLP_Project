 Most saddles have a removable leather strap called a girth or latigo that attaches with buckles to the tie on the horse's right side (some have a girth attached to the tie, in which case you can skip this step).Buckle the girth securely to the tie that hangs down by the horse's front leg on the right side of the horse.
Walk in front of the horse back to its left side, and then reach under the horse's body and pass the girth underneath the horse's chest.
 The girth should be pulled up to the buckle on the left side of the horse's saddle, where it should be fastened much like the other side using a buckle.


Cinch it tightly but gently (don't force it to go tighter than feels snug and secure). You should wait until the horse exhales to cinch it, because if you tighten it while the horse has its lungs full of air it will be too loose when the horse exhales to be safe.Some horses intentionally take a deep breath right before you tighten the girth. When they do that they get bigger around, so when they breathe out the girth is too loose - just the way they like it! This is called bloating, and some horses do it because a girth doesn't fit them or their skin is being pinched under the girth. If your horse does this, you might want to check that the girth itself is long enough for your horse and not causing irritation or pain.You can secure the additional length of the tie by passing it through the D-ring at the top of the tie, wrapping it around the tie and pulling it through at the top (like a men's necktie). This will keep it up and out of the way of the horse's legs even if the horse runs.
 Before you mount up, be sure you didn't forget anything.


Be sure the stirrups are down on either side.
Double-check that everything is tight because if it's loose and you get on you'll slide right off!
Be sure that the bridle is on correctly.
Now mount up and ride! Donâ€™t forget to mount from the left side.

 Medical or surgical masks are intended to cover both your mouth and nose. They are designed with material that can block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays and splatter — all of which may contain viruses or bacteria that may be harmful to you.Small-sized particles, however, may still be able to penetrate a medical mask. And, because the medical mask isn’t sealed against your skin, particles are also able to penetrate those openings.
 An N95 respirator is a device used by health practitioners to block 95% of very small particles. Unlike medical masks, N95 respirators fit more securely on your face and against your skin, and are able to filter airborne particles.While an N95 respirator can block 95% of very small particles — very small being considered 0.3 microns — there is still a 5% chance harmful particles can penetrate the respirator.
N95 respirators are not designed for use by children or by people who have facial hair.
Some N95 masks come with an exhalation valve that is designed to reduce condensation build-up inside the mask and allow the wearer to breathe easier. These masks, however, should not be used in a situation where a sterile field is required as the exhalation valve allows unfiltered (and possibly contaminated) air to leave the mask.In general, each type of N95 mask should come with detailed instructions from the manufacturer explaining how to put on and take off the mask. In order to ensure proper protection for both you and your patients, these instructions — above all others — must be followed. The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) also requires that users are trained how to fit and use N95 respirators.

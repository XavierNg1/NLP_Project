 Make sure it has all, or mostly all, of the knots out. A good tactic for this is to start at the bottom and work your way up, gently brushing through. A messy bun is easier to achieve if your hair has not been washed for a day or two, but if conditioning makes it easier to get the knots out, you can do that also.;
, Instead of wetting your hair, a better option would be using frizz serums and frizz tamer sprays that are sold at mostly every hair care Isle. Use personal preference to find which one suits you best and then apply on your hair, remember, a little goes a long way!

, However high up you want you bun to be, that's where you should put the ponytail. Don't worry about it being beat, we will create the messy style later. A messy bun is usually styled at the middle of your head, but it depends on your taste.
 Make sure the twist is tightly coiled, it will loosen up soon. Don't worry about any flyaways, the bun is meant to be messy.
 Wrap it as tight as you can again, it will come loose when you let go so do not worry.
 Bobby pins are often the best choice as they are not visible, but still hold your hair together. Use as many pins as you need to secure the bun. It is better if the pins are the colour of your hair if you don't want then to be seen, but again, it doesn't matter. Make sure you don't put too much in so the bun is tight and neat, but just enough to secure the bun.
 Try using dry conditioner or an anti-frizz hairspray. This will take any flyaways that stick out of your bun.
 Now look at the whole style. From the sides, gently pull at your hair and let some curls loose so the ponytail looks mildly messy. Don't pull too much out, it will not look nice and may even loosen your bun out.
 In the event that your hair gets very frizzy and starts falling apart, a headband will keep it looking neat until you can fix it.

 Although there may not be any at all, some symptoms include having had one or more unexplained miscarriages,stroke, heart attack, and/or blood clots in the legs or lungs (clots may also occur in the brain, renal vein, or arteries)., If you suffer from something such as lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic infections, or tumors, you may be more likely to develop LA.Keep in mind that LA may develop at any time. Just because you didn’t have it 10 years ago, doesn’t mean you don’t have it now.
 If you experience any of the following symptoms contact your doctor immediately, as it could be an indication that a potentially life threatening blood clot has formed:Swelling and redness in your legs.
Shortness of breath.
Pain, numbness, or loss of color in an arm or leg.
 If you are having symptoms, or feel that you are susceptible to LA, a PTT test can determine whether or not you have anticoagulant antibodies present in your blood. Using a needle, blood is collected from a vein (usually the arm) and placed in a specimen container. A chemical is then added to the blood sample to measure how long it takes for the blood to clot.Certain medications may affect the test results, so you should be sure to tell your doctor about any prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking to ensure you receive accurate results.
 If you receive an abnormal result in your PTT test, your doctor will likely order further testing to confirm the results. Some examples include the Russell viper venom time test, and the thromboplastin inhibition test.These tests may be repeated more than once to monitor the development of LA, especially if you have also been diagnosed with Lupus.

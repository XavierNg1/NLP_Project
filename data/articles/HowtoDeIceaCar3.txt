 Obviously, the best way to make your job easier is to get rid of the need for it. If you have a garage, use it! Even though the garage probably gets pretty cold at night, your car will be exposed to far less moisture in there, so ice shouldn’t accumulate., If you don’t have a garage, don’t worry. Prevent ice from building up on your windows by blocking them from the elements. Use a car cover, tarps, towels, or even cardboard as a barrier between the glass and moisture., If it’s pretty much guaranteed that your car is going to be iced over in the morning, give it a preventive treatment the night before. Spray the windows with your de-icer. Melt the ice as soon as it accumulates without having to get out of your warm cozy bed., This can be a waste of fuel and money (not to mention causing more air pollution), so don’t make a habit of this. But if you’re short on time, start the car and turn the heat on. Warm the glass up from the inside while you work on the outside.

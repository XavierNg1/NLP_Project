 Move the rack to the second lowest position.Place the butter into an 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) baking dish, then place the dish into the oven. The butter will melt as the oven heats up.
 Heat the milk up in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds first. Pour it into a mixing bowl and add the eggs. Whisk the two together until the mixture turns a pale yellow color and no streaks remain.
 Add in the flour, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Whisk everything together until most of the lumps are gone. Hold off on the cheese and scallions for right now.
 Once the butter has melted, take the baking dish out of the oven using an oven mitt. Swirl the butter across the bottom and sides of the dish. This will grease the dish and make the pancake easier to serve later on.
 Once you have the dish greased, pour the rest of the butter into the batter. Stir it in well with a whisk.
 Make sure that it is evenly spread across the bottom of the baking dish. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl clean so that you don't waste any batter.
 This will give the pancake a tasty, crunchy layer on top. Don't add the scallions just yet, however!

 To make you look attractive, try new clothes that make you look cute or adorable. Overall, wear clothes that make you feel pretty and comfortable. This helps more than you think. Wear bright cute clothes if your crush is athletic or something related to that, if your crush is goth, you probably should wear darker clothes.;
, Find out what he likes; maybe you both are interested in the same things. However, don't join all the same activities as him. That would make a guy feel like you're stalking him.
 How will he ever seem to be interested in you if he never sees you around? Strike up a conversation or invite him to join in an activity your participating in, or join the one he's doing.
 Look decent and feel comfortable in what you wear. Don't change your style to catch his attention. If you try step one, and it just doesn't feel right, then don't do it. After all, if it is just a crush, then it doesn't really matter, because chances are, you will eventually find another one.
 If someone asks how you feel about your crush say, "He/she's cool, I guess," not ,"OMG he/she's the hottest person around!"

, If you do, it's going to get around, and soon everyone will know. When everyone is pressuring your crush it will make him feel uncomfortable, and his answer will probably be no.

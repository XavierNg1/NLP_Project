 If your horse isn't registered in an EC (Equestrian Center) yet, then register him in one with Health Mashes.;
, This should increase the health some.
 This usually brings gives your horse another health point.
 If your horse is too fat, don't feed him any hay or oats. If he's too skinny, feed him 22 pounds of food.


If he's so skinny that his health starts deteriorating (it'll say under the 'History' tab on the bottom-left), feed him 22 pounds and all the oats you can give him, as well as letting him in the meadow for as long as possible.
 Always put him to bed in the box if he doesn't have a blanket, and if he does, then put him in whichever is in better condition. To see which is in better condition, click on the pasture and box buttons in the top right. The condition will be listed.
 It's fine to also work (train, compete, et cetera) your horse during this, as long as he always goes to bed in the right conditions (see step 4).
 If you cannot, give him a Black Orchid.


If you don't have a Black Orchid, before you buy one, check the Item Exchange. Quite often there are offers exchanging a BO for another 1-pass item you may have.

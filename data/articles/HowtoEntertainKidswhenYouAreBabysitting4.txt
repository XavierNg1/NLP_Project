 Cards can be painted, drawn or made using decoupage, stickers, etc.
 Measure the child's neck or wrist. Measure out the string and tape the end of the string to a paper plate. Start beading. When you are finished, remove the string and tie the two ends together.
 If you have a recipe that doesn't involve cooking on the stove, you can have the kids help make it. If you don't have the materials needed for play-dough, you can make something called Oobleck with simply water and cornstarch. This is especially good because it doesn't involve dangerous, hot ovens or sharp objects. Do this outside of course, as it is extremely messy, but that's the fun of it! Oobleck is a solid and a liquid. It is really fun.

 Use 1 tablespoon of water and 2 tablespoons of baking soda. Mix in a small bowl until no water remains and the mixture becomes a paste.
 Focus on areas with particularly strong buildup. Make sure to coat the steam vents as well. Don’t lay the paste on too thick, just enough to evenly coat the soleplate.
 Don’t hesitate to scrub at more tenacious spots. Wipe until no paste remains and the grimy buildups have been removed.
 Dip a cotton swab into water and insert it into the steam holes. Scrub to remove mineral deposits and the baking soda paste.








After cleaning the steam vents, bring the iron to your sink. Pour out any water that may have entered the steam holes.
Avoid the temptation to use paper clips or other hard, metal items that could scratch your iron's steam vents.
 Make sure to use a cloth you’re not too attached to, as some tenacious residues may end up staining it. Turn the iron to its highest setting and iron for a few minutes; the clean water will flush out any remaining deposits.








Pour out any remaining water over a sink.
Let the iron dry. Make sure not to leave it on a sensitive surface, in case sediments drip out of the steam vents.

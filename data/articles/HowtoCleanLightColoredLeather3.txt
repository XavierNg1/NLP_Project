 Because light colored leather shows all marks and stains, you want to make sure that you avoid staining the material. For example, if you own a white leather couch, you should avoid eating and drinking regularly on the couch. This will reduce the likelihood of stains.


Alternatively, if you own a cream colored leather handbag, you should not touch the bag immediately after putting on hand cream. The oils in the cream can transfer to the bag causing stains.
 As soon as a spill, smudge, or stain occurs on light colored leather, you should wipe it immediately with a microfiber cloth. If stains are left untreated they will become extremely difficult to remove. For example, you should wipe down light colored leather shoes after every use. This will keep them looking brand new., If you have purchased a leather designer handbag or couch, it may come with a list of cleaning instructions. Always read the instructions carefully before cleaning. They may give you helpful cleaning tips and product recommendations., If you are unable to remove stains from your light colored leather products, then you should have them professionally cleaned. For example, a light colored leather couch will experience regular wear and tear from sweat or dirty hands. Have this leather professionally cleaned a few times each year.

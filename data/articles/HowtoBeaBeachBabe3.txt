 If you live near the beach, make an effort to be there every day or every weekend if you can. Or, if you’re taking a vacation to a beach locale, do some research and pick a spot where there are popular beaches for sunbathing, surfing, or other water sports, depending on what you’re looking to do.


Make sure you know what the water temperature is if you’re planning on swimming or surfing! The Atlantic Ocean is generally a lot warmer than the Pacific, for example. Be prepared with a wetsuit if necessary.
If you’re vacationing, try heading to a warmer location in the winter months, like Mexico, Bali, or the Caribbean, to maximize beach time.
 If you live in a beach town, get paid to spend more time on the beach and support your lifestyle by getting a job as a surf instructor, a lifeguard, or a salesperson or server at beachside shops and restaurants.
 Get out to the beach in the early morning to catch the best waves (or just to chat up some surfers!). Check out local tide charts, buoy reports, and information about the breaks at a given beach to find the best times and conditions for great surf., Though you’ll probably spend most of your time on the beach during the day, head down on weekend nights to see if there’s a bonfire, party, or other event going on and join in the fun.

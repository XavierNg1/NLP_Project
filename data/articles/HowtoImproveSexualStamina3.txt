 One of the most common causes of premature ejaculation in men is nervousness and anxiety over the quality of one's performance.The best thing to do is relax and focus on enjoying the closeness with your partner. Remember that sex is about intimacy as much as pleasure, and great sex comes from chemistry much more than stamina or skill. If you find yourself getting stressed or "in your head," take a deep breath and spend a moment reconnecting with your partner.
 The classic way that men, and some women, use to control the timing of their orgasm is to concentrate on some mundane topic while having sex. Put the pleasure you are receiving to the back of your mind, and try doing a few basic math problems in your head until you are finally ready to climax.


Avoid thinking about topics or images that stress you out or turn you off. These can cause you to lose your arousal during sex, instead of simply letting you extend it. Instead try to think about something more abstract, such as visualizing geometric shapes or recalling the lyrics to a favorite song.
Don't extend your stamina at the expense of being present with your partner. Long sex can be dull for both of you if you spend the whole time with your head in the clouds. Use this technique sparingly and instead focus on engaging and being active with your partner.

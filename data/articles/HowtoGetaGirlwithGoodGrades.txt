 If she's on honor roll, she won't be interested in a guy who can't pass a class. You don't have to become a genius, but try other ways to raise your grades: put some more effort in, pay attention in class, etc. At least try to rise to the academic level that she's on.

, She may not like designer jeans, but she's not heartless! Just work on a confident, carefree grin that shows you're not totally stupid.
 She wants to know that you pay attention to things around you.

 It's a good idea to start with schoolwork: "Hey, do you have the homework?" or "What did you think of that assignment?" can't go too wrong. If she's on honor roll, she's a good student, so she probably does all her homework and understands the material.
 If she sits next to you in a class and you don't understand, ask if she can help you. But don't play dumb--remember, she probably wants someone who can understand things quickly.
 It makes you seem strong and she might like that.

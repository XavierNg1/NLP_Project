 If you want a shoe that will leave a lasting impression for a date or big event, a red heel is the way to go. Be careful about what you pair this shoe with, however, since pairing it with too many notably sexy garments can push your look into the realm of trashiness.;
, If you want to wear your red shoes to work or for a casual stroll down the block, a simple red pump is your best bet. Flats are simple enough to subdue wild red into submission.
 Heels can look classy, even if they are red. Closed-toe pumps are your best choice, and you can wear them with both casual and dressy outfits.
 If you feel uneasy about wearing a bright red shoe, start out by wearing a deeper shade, like burgundy. A deep shade of red is more subdued and a little less noticeable, which may make you feel more confident about your ability to pull it off.

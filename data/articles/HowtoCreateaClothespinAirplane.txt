, If you want to match the color of the craft sticks to the clothespin, or have multiple colors, color the sticks now. Either color with a marker or paint with acrylic paints. Allow to dry before proceeding.
, Place one craft stick on top and one under the clothespin.


Center each stick on the clothespin, ensuring equal amounts of the stick overhang on each side, matched perfectly under and above.
Add a little blob of glue, then the stick and press gently each time, to help the craft stick stay in place.
 Once again, add both the top and bottom wing pieces.
 Cut the tip off a craft stick with sharp scissors. Glue the tip to the back end of the plane, standing upright on the center of the top wing.
 The drying time will vary, depending on which glue you've used.
 This step is optional but can increase the enjoyment of making the craft and allows the maker to personalize it. Some examples for decorative elements include:


Add glitter to the wings and clothespin, or just to the wings. Either spread out glue and sprinkle on the glitter or use glitter glue.
Stick stickers onto the plane.
Draw things on the plane, such as windows, a logo or symbol for the airline, stripes, etc.
Glue on craft bits and pieces, such as buttons or sequins.
 The clothespin airplane is now ready for takeoff. Make more in different colors for a fleet and to play with friends.

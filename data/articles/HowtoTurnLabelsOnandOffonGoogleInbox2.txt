 You need to open the Google Inbox application before you can begin changing labels on and off. Look for the app icon featuring a blue envelope with a checkmark, and tap on it.
 If you logged out of your previous Inbox session, or if this is the first time to use the Inbox app, you will be asked to sign into your account. Enter your Google email address and password in their respective fields, and tap the “Log in” button to load your account.
 You can start this process by tapping the three horizontal lines at the top left side of the screen. This will cause a drop-down menu to appear.


Scroll down to the bottom of the menu and look for “Settings.” Tap to open the Settings menu.
 Notice that the only thing on your screen will be your email address; tap it and a list of settings will pop up. Towards the bottom of the list is a setting that says “Bundle message,” and it will be set to On.
 Since the option is by default set to On, just tap the slider button to switch it to Off. Tap the slider button again if you want to switch labels Off.

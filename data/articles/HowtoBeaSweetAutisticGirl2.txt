 Showing people how you feel helps them connect with you and love you. If you feel enthusiastic and want to flap your hands, do it. If you're sad, find someone you trust and tell them what's wrong.
 Your stimming helps you stay calm, focus, and express your feelings.It is part of your disability (just like a blind person's white cane or a deaf person's sign language) and it's okay to be disabled in public. It's cute to be you!

, This can mean different things for different people, but it more or less means dressing in ways that make you smile. If you love it, that means it's lovable.


Wear your favorite colors.
Pick comfy fabrics that are great for stimming. Try soft fabrics like microfiber, breezy fabrics, or whatever you like.
Dress in layers in case you get hot or cold.
 If you do things that make you smile, it will help you be positive and nice to other people. Read about your special interests, sing and dance to music, paint, build a toy robot, or do whatever you like.


Your special interests are very important.Try joining clubs and meeting people who like your interests so that you can talk about them.
Autism is not just a list of problems. You also have remarkable strengths., You may have trouble speaking and snuggle with stuffed animals while you read Jane Eyre. This is all okay. A sweet autistic girl is a girl who isn't afraid to be herself.
 It's okay to be autistic, and it's okay to be you. You are already wonderful just the way you are!

 You should aerate your lawn every 2 to 3 years. This process removes small plugs of soil from the ground and allows new nutrients, soils, air and water to get to the roots of the existing plants. If your lawn is large, you may want to break it up into smaller segments and do a different one each year.;
, Rent an aerator if you donâ€™t have one. You can find manual models, as well as models that you can pull behind a riding lawn mower. If you have a small lawn, you can even consider aerators that strap onto your shoes. You just walk around your lawn and poke holes in it with the soles of the aerators.

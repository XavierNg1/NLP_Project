 Knowing the cause of your blocked fallopian tubes may help your doctor formulate an effective treatment plan. Sexually transmitted infections are some of the most common causes of blockages. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other STIs can lead to the development of scar tissue that blocks the fallopian tubes and prevents pregnancy. This can be a problem even if your STIs were treated and resolved., Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can result from sexually transmitted infections and lead to blockages. If you have PID (or a history of PID), you have an increased risk of developing blocked fallopian tubes and infertility., In women with endometriosis, uterine tissue grows outside its normal location, implanting on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or other organs. If you have endometriosis, know that it can lead to blocked fallopian tubes., If you ever had a uterine infection, perhaps in connection with a miscarriage or abortion, itâ€™s possible that scar tissue formed and blocked one or both fallopian tubes.


Although uncommon in the United States, pelvic tuberculosis may also cause blocked fallopian tubes., Ectopic pregnancies are those in which the fertilized egg implants in the wrong place, usually in the fallopian tube. These pregnancies cannot grow to term, and when they burst or are removed, they can cause scarring and blockages., If you have ever had abdominal surgery, your risk of developing blocked fallopian tubes is higher. Surgeries on the fallopian tubes themselves are especially risky.

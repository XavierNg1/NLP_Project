 If a friend, co-worker, relative, or even an online friend wants to talk, give them your full attention. Make them feel appreciated that you're there by giving them advice and always try to get them to see a positive aspect of it. Everyone loves smiles and hugs, especially in a stressful situation.
 When parents are buried in work, household chores to maintain a clean & safe house, and bill payment deadlines to meet, it's hard to set some time off to spend quality time with kids. Help them out with homework, have fun preparing for a test by creating index card games, take them to the park, or even play their favorite video game with them., Don't hesitate to let someone in the supermarket line before you if they have a few things while you have a full cart. Open the door for a senior citizen and allow them to walk in/out before you., Allow people to go in front of you to make a merge and never play the "bumper-to-bumper game" so that people can't merge. Avoid taking a parking space because it's closer and more convenient for you; go further back to allow someone else the chance - it's also good exercise to walk., Use this day to re-evaluate how you present yourself towards others. Offer help to someone first; don't wait for them to come to you. Explain things with specific instructions instead of a basic overview. Take the time out and ensure that they are presented with the best assistance., "Me" things are activities or wants that people desire to do on their spare or leisure time by themselves. Examples could be sleeping in to a later time, taking a stress-free walk by themselves, or reading a book in a peaceful & quiet place. Agree to an outing with friends or attend your daughter's stuffed animal tea party., If you have put someone else before you, how did it make you feel? Were you satisfied or unhappy with the result(s)? Try to adapt and practice this everyday and see if it comes back to you.

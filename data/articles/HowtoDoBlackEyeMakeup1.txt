 Take the darkest color eyeshadow you want to use (black or dark gray) and swipe it on in an arch shape just above the crease of your eyelid, from the outside corner to the middle of the eyelid. Then apply it right along the lash line.;
, Apply a slightly lighter gray color to the middle of the eyelid, and blend it in with the darker color in the corner using a small soft brush., Use a black eyeliner pencil to carefully line your top lashes, drawing from the inner corner to a point at the outer corner, staying as close to the lash line as possible. Then do the same to the bottom lash line and your waterline (the side of your bottom lashes closest to your eyeball) by pulling your undereye skin down slightly.Use a gel or liquid liner for your upper lash line if you like, but only use pencil on your waterline, because liquid liner will easily transfer to your eyeball from your waterline and irritate your eye.
 Use a smudge brush, q-tip, or your fingertip to gently smudge the liner on your bottom lashes, creating that signature hazy, smokey look. You can smudge the top liner too if you wish.


If you want more color below your eye, you can also dab on a gray eyeshadow with a firm-bristled brush just below the liner.
 Use a light silver, cream, or shimmery white eyeshadow or a highlighter pencil in the inner corner of your eye. Blend if needed to create an even and gradual change from light to dark across your eyelids., Get a black volumizing and lengthening mascara and apply it liberally to your top and bottom lashes, pulling the brush out from base to tip in a repeated motion.

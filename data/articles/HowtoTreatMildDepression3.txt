 Sometimes it can be difficult to observe how your nutrition affects your mood since food's effect is not immediate. However, it is important to pay attention to what you eat and how it makes you feel to track your depression.


Eat foods that relate to fewer symptoms of depression, including fruit, vegetables, and fish.Avoid foods that relate to more symptoms of depression, including processed foods such as processed meats, chocolates, sweet desserts, fried foods, processed cereals and high-fat dairy products.
 Dehydration can contribute to emotional and physical changes. Your mood can be negatively affected even by mild dehydration. Drink plenty of water throughout the day, not just when you feel thirsty or when you exercise.


Men should aim to drink about 13 eight-ounce servings of water per day, and women should drink 9 eight-ounce servings of water per day., People with depression may have low levels of certain brain chemicals, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Fish oil capsules have omega-3 fatty acids and contain EPA and DHA. These can help alleviate some mild symptoms of depression.Take 3 grams or less per day. Higher doses of fish oil can prevent your blood from clotting, which can increase the chance of bleeding., Many people experiencing depression have a deficiency of folate, which is a B vitamin.Increase your folate levels by eating lots of spinach, nuts, beans, asparagus and Brussels sprouts.

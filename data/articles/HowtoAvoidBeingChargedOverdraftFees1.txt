 Your bank may offer a service that limits or completely eliminates overdraft fees. Typically you have three such options:


Overdraft coverage: a limited coverage in which the bank will honor a check that pulls your balance below zero, anticipating that you will reimburse them in the immediate future.
Overdraft protection: the bank will automatically withdraw funds from another of your accounts or grant you a line of credit in the event of an overdraft. A line of credit typically involves interest payments and transaction fees.
Complete opt-out: you're under no obligation to have any overdraft protection at all. If you opt out, one or more of your checks could be rejected. In such a case you might be charged an overdraft fee.;
, If you very rarely overdraw an account you've maintained for a long time, approach a customer-service representative about having the overdraft fee removed. Many banks will waive such a fee for normally reliable customers.
 Your bank may consider waiving a series of charges stemming from the same overdraft if you're willing to set up a savings account for automatic overdraft protection. As an added incentive you could offer to accept other services with the bank in exchange for eliminating the fees.

 If your cat is severely diabetic it will benefit from insulin therapy. Your cat's pancreas is not producing enough insulin and so giving your cat some will help it process sugar more effectively.Discuss your concerns about treatment with insulin with your veterinarian. They may be able to assuage your fears. Even if they can't, having a conversation about your options can't hurt.
Insulin needs to be given in the correct dosage, otherwise it could cause your cat's blood sugar to drop to a dangerously low level. Be sure to follow the directions of a veterinarian if you do decide to give your cat insulin., These medications will lower your cat's blood sugar. However, they are not usually prescribed. Consider using them if your veterinarian suggests them, as this means that your cat's condition is serious and needs extreme treatment., Just because you decide to put your cat on insulin that doesn't mean that you shouldn't work on changing its lifestyle or that you can't also use natural medicine practices also. With enough lifestyle changes you may be able to decrease your cat's need for insulin so much that it no longer needs the medication.


In a case like this, the insulin only served as a temporary solution that helped your cat until the disease was under control.
However, if you decide to wean your cat off of insulin, it should be done under the care of a veterinarian. Extreme changes to insulin levels can be dangerous for your cat.

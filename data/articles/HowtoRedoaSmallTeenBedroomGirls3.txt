 Upgrade your bedroom without having to buy anything new by simply rearranging the furniture to new places. You can also make the room appear bigger just by keeping furniture to a minimum and placing it strategically.


Keep furniture against the walls to open up the space in a small room, but keep pieces of furniture from touching if possible to make the room feel less crowded.
You can also try placing furniture along the longest view or walkway of your room, which is a diagonal. Use the empty spaces and corners behind furniture in this configuration for extra storage., Maximize the space and function in your room by using furniture that has storage spaces or can fit items underneath. Find ways to make a bed or seat also act as a way to hold your stuff.If you can buy new furniture, look for items like an ottoman with a storage space inside, or a bed with drawers built in underneath. You can even buy a lofted bed (a bunk bed without the bottom bunk) and keep a desk, dresser, chair, or other larger items underneath.
If you can’t buy new furniture, use the space under your bed to store boxes and bins, keep items tucked under a table or desk, or use a trunk as a seating area as well as for storage.
 Make your room look bigger and more trendy by moving storage off the ground and onto the walls, if you can. Replace bulky bookshelves and cabinets with floating shelves and cubbies.


Try using different-sized storage cubes mounted on the wall for an interesting way to store items by your bed or desk.You don’t have to have fancy shelving to create wall storage. Try painting a simple wooden crate in your favorite color, then hanging it on the wall for easy display and storage of your stuff.

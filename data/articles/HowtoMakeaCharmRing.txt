 Jump rings are available for purchase but it is easy to make them yourself. Wrap the 14 gauge wire around a pencil as many times as the number of jump rings you need. Remove wire from the pencil. Use the wire cutter to cut across the top of the loops. Leave the ends of each jump ring open so you can slip on the charms.


If you have jump rings already, see How to Open a Jump Ring.
Whenever you're cutting wire, there's always the chance of a piece flying into your face. Use eye protection.

, If you're using seed beads, see How to Work with Seed Beads.
 Put two or three beads on one head pin. Twist the end of the pin around the narrow part of the needle nose pliers. Use flat nosed pliers to grasp the wire end, and wrap it around the base of the loop three times. Trim close to the loop.
 Use the wire tools to firmly close each jump ring.

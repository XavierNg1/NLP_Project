 Turn the dial to the right. This clears the lock and resets it so that it's ready to open.
 The marker or line should be at the top of the dial, pointing to the twelve o'clock position. In many cases, it will be red. The first number on this lock's combination is 36, so you should stop turning the dial when the marker points to that number.
 Spin it counterclockwise one full turn, past the first number (36), then stop at the second number—in this case, 10.
 Finally, turn the dial clockwise again and stop at the last number on the sticker—1.
 Pull up the shackle at the top of the lock, and it should open right up. You can also hold on to the shackle and pull down the lock.





If it doesn't open, repeat the process from the beginning. Once you've partially engaged the tumblers, you should clear out the lock before trying again.

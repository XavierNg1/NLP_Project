 You're left with nothing in the 3-jug and 2 gallons in the 5-jug.
 You're left with 2 gallons in the 3-jug. And nothing in the 5-jug.

 You now have 3 gallons (11.4 L) in the 3-jug and 3 gallons in the 5-jug.
 You now have 1 gallon (3.8 L) in the 3-jug and 5 gallons (18.9 L) in the 5-jug. This is because, in the last step, you only had 2 gallons (7.6 L) of space left over, so you could only pour 2 gallons.

 Have a schedule for when you wash and condition your hair. Washing your hair every day is not good. Washing your hair to little is also not good. Wash your hair according to thickness.


If your hair is very fine/thin, every 3 days should be good at the most.
For thicker hair, every 2 days is probably best.;
, Your hair will get to know this schedule and be more healthy.
 Buy something that is for your hair type. If you have frizzy curly hair, invest in a smoothing shampoo/ conditioner. If you have flat hair, buy a volumizing conditioner, etc.
 Squirt a few drops of shampoo into your hand, more if your hair is thicker. Rub it into your scalp and roots, then make your way to your ends. Leave it for 2 minutes, and rinse.
 Squirt some conditioner into your hand and rub through ends.


It is in fact okay to let conditioner touch your scalp. It will not make your hair oily.
 Towel dry hair with a thick towel and leave it to air dry.


Never comb wet hair. This will cause it to be brittle and split. Wait until hair is at least half dry until combing. If you must use a blow dryer, try to put it on low heat and place a nozzle on the end if possible.

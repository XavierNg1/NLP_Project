 If you are going to apply makeup and conceal the pimple, do not pop the pimple beforehand. That will be your first instinct, but you should never apply makeup to irritated and broken skin, which is exactly what you are doing if you pop it. , Rinse your face off and dry with a clean towel, then use a cleanser that is gentle on your skin. Applying makeup to a dirty face increases future breakouts and is unhealthy for your skin.
 After washing and cleansing your face, it’s important to get some of that moisture back so your face doesn’t dry out. Use a light moisturizer all over your face, and allow that to set and dry for 10 minutes before applying any makeup.

 If you're starting with ground turkey that's frozen, you'll need to defrost it before you brown it. To defrost the ground turkey in the refrigerator, place it in the refrigerator 24 hours before you plan to cook it. You could also remove the ground turkey from its packaging and place it in a microwave-safe dish. Use the defrost setting on your microwave for the specific weight of ground turkey you want to defrost.To prevent food spoilage, you'll need to brown the ground turkey immediately after you've defrosted it in the microwave.
If you don't have time to defrost the meat, you can safely cook it straight from frozen. It will just take more time to brown and be more difficult to stir.;
, Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. If you're using very lean ground turkey, you may want to add a few teaspoons of vegetable oil to the skillet. This will keep the ground turkey from sticking to the pan., Remove the ground turkey from its packaging and place it in the preheated skillet. Use a spoon to break up the ground turkey and stir it well., Stir the ground turkey occasionally and let it cook for 14 to 16 minutes. The turkey should turn a white gray color and then begin to brown a little as it caramelizes., Insert a thermometer and check the temperature of the meat. It should be 165 degrees F (70 degrees C) before it's safe to use in a recipe., Place a few paper towels on a large plate. Scoop the cooked meat onto the paper towels so you leave the grease in the skillet and the paper towels absorb the excess grease.

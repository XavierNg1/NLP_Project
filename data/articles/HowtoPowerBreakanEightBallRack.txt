 This depends on your bridge-hand - the hand that is on the table during your shot. Left Handed Bridges: Place the cue ball far enough from the right rail so your hand has enough room to use either an open or a closed bridge. Right Handed bridges should do the opposite.;
, Your cue stick should strike the cue ball right at the center of the cue ball.
 You should aim for the cue ball to strike the second row of balls in the rack.
 Blast the cue ball with a straight shot using a medium-hard to hard stroke.
 Do not pull your cue stick up right away. Your cue stick on any shot should follow through the shot 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm).
 First start off just practicing the shot, then add the rack.

 On a regular basis, and before you do a general cleaning, glance over your countertops looking for stand-out stains and discoloration. Soak a cotton ball in the cleaning solution of your choice and place the ball on top of the stain. You can place a glass on top to weigh it down against the stain. Remove in 5-10 minutes and check the status of the stain. Repeat as necessary.Oil stains, in particular, can be tough to remove and may respond better to a paste or cleaning poultice.
 Get out a bottle of laundry stain remover and gently spray it directly onto any spots or problem areas. Let the remover soak in for a few minutes. Then, wipe down with damp cloth. Or, you could follow up by sprinkling a bit of laundry detergent on top of the lingering stain. Gently scrub this mixture into the countertop until you see the stain lifting., Get a medium bowl or bucket and mix together one cup (240 mL) of flour, one to two tablespoons (15-30 mL) of hydrogen peroxide, and enough tablespoons of water to form a thick paste. Get a rag, scoop up some paste, and place it onto the countertop. Concentrate on lumping it over stains, in particular. Wipe off the paste with a wet cloth while gentle rubbing the surface.For particularly stubborn stains, you can cover that area with plastic wrap and let it sit for a few hours before removing it.The paste should have a peanut butter like consistency.

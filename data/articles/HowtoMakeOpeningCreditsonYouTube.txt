 For more advanced users, you might like to try a more professional and polished result like Sony Vegas or Corel Video Studio which are both available at online stores (Amazon, eBay). Alternatively, you could use YouTube to make an opening sequence, as of 2014, which is really useful for beginners.;
, Make sure you have permission to use them, and that it's legal to use them on websites such as YouTube (copyright act, fair use, etc)

, How many characters are in your opening credits? How long will it run for? Most opening credits run under a minute long, and consist of short and quick clips.
 Effects can make a really big difference, so using a colour corrector or transition effect between slides can make your video look much more professional. Say your theme was a superhero credits; you'd need a theme song that fitted (remembering the copyright act and if the music is original or not), a list of names to put in the video, and most importantly, a distinctive font. Most can be found at free download font websites, or you can use a font built in to Microsoft Word.
 You can change the way it enters and leaves, or the colour or the text to give it a more polished finish. You can change the text colour or effects as the video goes on. The more original your video is, the more it will resemble how it is unique.

 Cream bleach is appropriate for lightening hairs that are not completely black, just dark. It lasts for up to 2 weeks. Be sure to only choose bleach that is recommended for use on the face; since the skin here is so sensitive, you have to be extra careful to avoid irritation.


If applicable, choose a cream that suits your skin type (ex. dry, oily, etc.).
 Apply a small dab to a sensitive but safe area (such as the skin of your inner wrist) to make sure you don’t react. Leave on for the recommended amount of time (read the box for instructions), wash away thoroughly, and wait at least another 10 or 15 minutes to make sure you don’t itch or turn red.
, The cream should come with an applicator, but if it doesn’t, use a popsicle stick or put on gloves and use a finger. Be very careful not to get it on your lip itself or near the delicate skin in your nostrils, which can cause your skin to react.
 Use a Q-tip or cotton pad to wipe the cream away (wipe away from your nose/mouth, not toward them) and check to see if the hair is light. If not, wait a little longer.


Ideally, bleaching cream should not be used on the skin for more than 10 minutes because it’s so hard on the skin. If your cream recommends more time than this, test it at the 10-minute mark anyway; if it has worked, remove the rest.
 Again, use cotton pads or something similar to wipe up the cream and don’t get it on any sensitive areas.
 Rinse more than you think you need to so that no residue will irritate your skin.

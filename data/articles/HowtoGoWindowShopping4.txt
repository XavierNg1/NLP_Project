 For some, impulse buying is a big threat when window shopping. If you truly just want to window shop and not purchase anything, make that decision ahead of time and stick to it.If you don’t think you’ll be able to resist the temptation to buy, try one of these strategies:


Stick to looking at only the window displays if you think you’ll be tempted to buy—don’t go inside any stores.
If you’re window shopping with a friend, let them know that you’re trying to just go window shopping, and do not want to buy anything. They can remind you of this if you try to purchase an item.
 If you’re afraid you won’t be able to keep yourself to just window shopping, leave your wallet or purse in the car or at home. Doing so will ensure you don’t have any means to purchase something in the store. You may, however, want to bring a small amount of cash along to grab coffee or lunch.


If you’re an online window shopper, don’t save any of your credit card information on retailers’ websites. This will make it more difficult for your to make a purchase and help you stick to just window shopping., Most people have triggers that cause them to want to shop or to make impulse buys when they are shopping. Think about what emotions make you want to shop. For example, do you purchase more when you are feeling sad? Or excited? Once you identify these triggers, avoid window shopping when you are feeling this way because you’ll be more at risk to purchasing items impulsively.

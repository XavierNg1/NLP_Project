 Provide your account information. Indicate that you would like to make a payment.
 The account number on your debit card will not be sufficient to make a phone payment. Technically you will be paying with a check. That does not mean that you need to provide a physical check, but you need a check on hand to provide the bank routing number, account number, and transit information.The account number and transit information can be found on the bottom left corner on the front of your check.
 Payment by phone is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but is not always credited instantly. Payments made before 5:00 pm will be credited to that day. Payments after 5:00 pm will be credited to the following day. The exception is the weekend. Any payment made after 5:00 pm on Friday will not be credited to your account until Sunday.

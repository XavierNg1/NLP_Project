 Then choose a world that you want to play on. There are three options: Mars, Earth, and Fantasy. When you click on the world you want to join, you will see many eras, some which are 1 ticks per hour, others 2 or more ticks per hour. 1 tick means that the game will be refreshed every hour, and 2 ticks means that the game will be refreshed twice every hour. If you're new, start on a slower paced era.
 Following the tutorial might cost you resources later, so create your castle and skip the tutorial. The top left corner is the section to control your colony. You can send and receive messages from other Battle Dawn players, view events, monitor radars, manage your colony, view community, give troops orders, find locations, cast far sight spells, build outposts, and boost your colony.

 Try to drop all the stones so they fall in a naturally random pattern. Flip the upside-down stones with a damp fingertip.
 Trim the shape so it fits your undercut. You may want to leave a cutout for your ear. If you wear glasses, ensure there will be no stones under the "temple" (arm) of your glasses for comfort. Gently press the lint-roller sheet onto the pattern of stones. Lift the sheet and lay it sticky side up. You should see the flat backs off all of your stones., Use a toothpick or thin brush to make sure the drop of glue extends to the edges of each stone. You have to act a little fast, as the glue will dry if left out for more than 3 minutes or so. You don't have to be perfect; it's okay to leave a few stones behind. Don't spill the glue or put it on the paper itself. Close the glue lid tightly the moment you are done., Press firmly and leave in place for four minutes. The tape shouldn't be sticky enough to hurt upon peeling off., It should leave behind a galaxy of beautiful stones. Any bits of paper can be cut out with scissors. Note that the stones can only be removed with scissors as superglue is permanent.

 This is the easiest way to stay in touch with people, without allowing your workplace to track your usage. You have the added advantage of being able to check posts and tweet during your commute, lunch breaks and coffee breaks.


Although most employers look down on employees receiving personal calls during work time, most employers do not have any policies against having a phone at work. As long as you check your Twitter app covertly, you are likely not to get in trouble.
 You can either have them sent to your personal email, if you are allowed to use it during work hours, or you can take the risk of having them go to your work email. Try NutShellMail.


You should also realize that most companies keep an eye on their employee's email. The IT department, your manager and/or your office manager may have access to your emails. If they see daily updates from NutShell, they may check into your behavior.
 This is an Outlook add-in that allows you to use all the Outlook features to tweet, send Twitter pictures and receive updates. Your Twitter account will appear in a different section than your work email, so it would be harder for employers to track.
 If instant messaging is allowed in your office, you may be able to keep in touch while you communicate with friends or colleagues during work.
 This desktop application is designed to look exactly like an Excel spreadsheet, specifically like Excel 2007. When you open SpreadTweet, the columns are cleverly disguised to help you receive updates, retweet and tweet.

 Pick bamboo that is younger than 3-years-old to transplant.If you already have a bamboo plant in a pot or in the landscape, it's simple to propagate by cutting sections of the stem and replanting them, a method called culm-segment cutting. The sections of bamboo develop new roots creating a clone of the parent plant. Try to cut from the stalkâ€™s middle. You need at least two full internodes in the middle and two half internodes on either end. Internodes are the section between two nodes.
Cut a bamboo cane into sections containing two to three nodes, the places along a bamboo cane where the leaves grow from. Use a sharp knife to do this. Look for the bamboo to flair out and have a slight division in it to find a node. Cut as many culm sections for replanting as bamboo plants you want to grow. Each section will grow into a new plant.
Add a couple extra to make up for potential loss, rot or failure to set root. Cut the foliage off the culm cutting with a pair of clippers.
 Dig a hole in the ground or fill a 6-inch nursery pot with potting soil. Plant the culm section in the soil with one or two nodes covered. Position the culm cutting so that it is vertical or at a 45-degree angle in the pot or planting bed.


Keep the soil damp by watering when the top of the dirt feels dry to the touch. The best time to transplant bamboo cuttings is in the fall at the beginning of the rainy season. Take advantage of the wet months to get your bamboo cuttings started.
If you plant in spring or summer, keep the culm sections well-watered. Don't let them dry out or the roots are likely to die or simply fail to form. True bamboo is part of a grass family. Keep the bamboo moist, and only transplant bamboo in warm weather.
There is another plant frequently grown as a house plant called lucky bamboo. It's not bamboo at all. Don't get this confused with regular bamboo or your cutting and planting efforts will not work.

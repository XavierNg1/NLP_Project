 Plain rubber bands tear and split your hair.
 Using heat severely dries your hair, which can cause split ends or frizz.


Air-dry your hair whenever possible.
Before using any heated cosmetics, you should apply heat-protection serum to your hair. Heat-protection serum will not only protect your hair cuticles, but it can also give your hair a healthy shine.
 This is one of the easiest ways to end up with dry frizzy hair, as constantly washing your hair can strip your hair of its natural oils.


Although it's okay for those with short hairstyles to wash their hair every day, people with longer hair should consider washing your hair less frequently. People with shoulder-length hair, should wash their hair every other day; those with hair longer than that should wash their hair every third day.

 It must be big enough to hold the bottles and close the lid. A dutch oven or large soup pot is usually the right size.;
, Make sure they are completely submerged. Put the lid on the pot and turn up the heat to high. Bring the water to a boil and allow the bottles to boil for 5 full minutes.









If you have too many bottles to fit in your pot, you can sterilize your bottles in batches.
You can add the lids and nipples to the pot with the bottles.
Don't add bottles to water that is already boiling. The shock from the heat could cause the glass to break.
Don't let the bottles boil for more than 5 minutes. This is a sufficient amount of time to sterilize them.
 Let the water cool a bit, then use a pair of tongs to remove the bottles from the pot and set them on a clean dishcloth to drain.









Make sure your hands are clean when you handle the bottles after sterilizing them.
Let the bottles air dry, rather than using a dishcloth to dry them. This reduces the chances that they'll get contaminated after sterilization.
Avoid drying the bottles in a dish drying rack unless the rack has also been sterilized.
When the bottles are dry, they're ready to be used or stored.

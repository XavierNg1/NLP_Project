 Rutabaga is best roasted at 425 F (218 C), so set the oven and let it preheat to that temperature. Line a baking sheet with cooking spray, parchment paper, or a silicone mat. This will prevent the rutabaga from sticking to the pan., Scrub the rutabaga with a vegetable brush under running water. Cut off the top and tail, and cut the rutabaga in half. Peel the skin off with a paring knife, being very careful not to cut yourself. Chop the rutabaga into 1-inch (2.5-cm) chunks., Transfer the chunks to a large mixing bowl. Drizzle the oil over the chunks. Season the rutabaga with salt and pepper, to taste. Toss everything together to coat the chunks with the oil and seasonings.

Other seasonings you can add to the rutabaga include garlic powder, dried rosemary, fresh minced garlic, onion powder, or a small minced onion., Spread the rutabaga out evenly on the baking sheet and place it in the oven. Bake the rutabaga for about 40 minutes, until itâ€™s tender and golden brown.After 40 minutes, pierce a chunk with a fork. The rutabaga is ready if the fork enters easily and the rutabaga feels soft.
 Use an oven mitt to remove the cooked rutabaga from the oven. Transfer the roasted chunks to a serving bowl, or portion them out onto individual plates and serve with meat, fish, or a vegetable-based protein.

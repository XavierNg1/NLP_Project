 If you don’t already have a Google account, you can create one by signing up on any Google website. Google accounts are free. See How to Make a Google Account for more details.


The account will also provide you with an @gmail.com email address.
This account is used for anything that Google creates. You can access free applications such as Google Docs and Google Sheets, which are Google’s version of Word and Excel.;
, Once you have your account set up you can now access Google Play at play.google.com.


Sign in to your Google account if you haven’t already.
You will now be able to search through all of the content available on the store.
 When you click the Settings button located at the top-right of the screen, you will have a few options. Select “My Account” and you will be directed to where you can add payment methods.
 You can add a debit card, credit card or PayPal account with which to make payments for purchases. Alternatively, you can buy Google Play cards from various retail locations.
 Please be aware that some items you can buy on Google Play have a time limit, such as movie rentals. Many other applications, magazines, etc. are a one-time purchase to own.


If you add a credit/debit card, you will be able to make purchases without maintaining a credit balance on the account. Google will just charge your card.
If you choose not to tie a card to your account, you will need to redeem gift cards and make sure that you have enough of a balance to cover your purchases.

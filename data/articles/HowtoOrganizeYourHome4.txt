 Staying organized is about developing better habits. One good habit to develop is analyzing each new item you buy or otherwise acquire. Don’t build up a whole bunch of things you don’t need. This will make your home cluttered and disorganized all over again. Remember for that each item you acquire, you will have to find a home for it.
 Get in the habit of always putting things away when you are done using them. Don’t tell yourself you’ll get it later or that maybe someone else will need to use it: just put it away. This habit will go the furthest in ensuring that your home stays organized.
 Always have a bag or box in your house which is a designated ‘donate’ location. Put items in there that you find you don’t use anymore and try to put one or two items in every time you acquire a new item.

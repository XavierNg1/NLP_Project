  You don't want to wear jeans while playing a sport.  Always wear loose and baggy clothes when you're not playing a sport, but when you are, wear comfortable and stretchy but skin tight clothes that complement your figure.  Try not to wear anything too girly or over the top.  Look presentable.
  Wash your hair everyday if you play sports that require you to move a lot (most sports), because your hair is going to be sopping wet, and not on purpose, after ever sport you play.  If you don't sweat as much, wash your hair every other day to every 3 days.  Style your hair in a bun, ponytail, braid, or just natural and left down.
  Shower or bathe daily, and scrub your body well, with body wash or soap.  You should feel fresh and clean after every soak you take.  Brush your teeth twice daily, and floss, which is recommended.  Wear clean clothes too.

 Statins are drugs that are used to lower blood cholesterol levels. They interfere with an enzyme (HMG Co-A reductase) that is involved in synthesis of cholesterol. You are a candidate of statin therapy if you belong to one of the following four statin-benefit groups:


Patients having clinical Athero-Sclerotic Cardio-Vascular Disease ( ASCVD)
Having very high LDL cholesterol levels (190 mg/dL or higher)
Patients who have type 2 diabetes and are between 40-75 years of age
Having a 7.5% or higher risk of heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years, as calculated by your healthcare provider.
 If you belong to one of the above mentioned groups, you doctor will advise you treatment with statins, for example:


Tab. Atorvastatin 40mg-80mg taken orally, once a day.
Tab. Rosuvastatin 20mg-40mg taken orally, once a day.
The usual side effects include muscle pain, fatigue, lethargy and liver toxicity, and statin treatment requires regular monitoring. Therefore, this treatment should only be started under supervision of a doctor.
 Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are risk factors for development of ischemic heart disease. However, in these patients, adequately controlling blood glucose levels and high blood pressure lowers this risk.Therefore, if you are suffering from one of these diseases, you should consult your doctor for adequate drugs and lifestyle management of these conditions.

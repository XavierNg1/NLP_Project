 If you have a busy work schedule and can't accommodate the time that you can, make sure to take every opportunity to volunteer on your free time. This can include less structured volunteer help such as printing out flyers, sending emails, or helping your children with school projects can take the pressure off another overworked parent volunteer.You can also bake or cook food for school events if you can find the extra time.
 If you have a busy work schedule and miss events and fundraisers at your child's school, make sure to take a break from work and dedicate a day during the year towards your child. Talk to your kid about an upcoming event that they need your help with, and talk to your supervisor at work about taking off to help them for the day.


If your job already comes with paid-time-off, this is a great opportunity to use a vacation day.
Ask for your day off at least two weeks in advance.
You can ask by saying something like, "My kid is having a class trip on December 7th, so I'm requesting off that day so I can help chaperone."

, Tutoring and mentoring kids is especially important in larger schools with more students because there's a chance they don't get enough one-on-one education. Try to find struggling kids in your children's classroom and invite them over after work and help them with their homework or class projects.Some schools have structured tutoring sessions at the school that you can attend.Make sure to clear the tutoring session with the children's parents before they come over.
Overworked teachers will appreciate the extra help that you provide the students.

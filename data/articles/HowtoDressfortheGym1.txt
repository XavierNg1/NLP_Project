 Wear a breathable material like cotton or polyester. When you work out, you'll grow hot and sweaty, so you want to make sure that your clothing doesn't trap the heat. If possible, choose a top that is specifically designed for wicking sweat. Consider wearing a tank top or sports bra for a more breathable—if more revealing—outfit.If you have large breasts, then a sports bra may be essential for a comfortable gym experience. No matter your size, a bit of extra support never hurts.;
, Wear something flexible, with an elastic waistband: gym shorts, sweatpants, track pants, or yoga pants. You should be able to perform a full range of leg workouts while you're wearing the bottoms. The bottoms that you wear also depend on the effect that you're going for: tight and skin-showing clothing can help you show off, and baggier, more flowing garments might help you blend in.Short shorts may afford you the most flexibility, but they can also show a lot of skin. If you feel shy in shorts: wear sweats or yoga pants.
 The shoes you wear will depend upon the sort of exercises that you're doing. If you plan to do any cardio, then bring shoes that will offer plenty of protection for your feet and legs.


If you'll be running on a treadmill, then make sure to bring running shoes. If you will be using an elliptical or exercise bike, then your footwear doesn't matter so much – just wear something comfortable that you can stand in.
If you'll be training weights, make sure to wear something with ample ankle and arch support. Running shoes are always a good choice.

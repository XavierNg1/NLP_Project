 Most Korean spas have gender-specific nude areas, which means you are free to go nude within the confines of specified areas. So, in the male area, men are free to go nude, and it’s the same in the female area. Within these areas there are saunas, bathing areas and grooming areas. So, you can slowly get accustomed to being nude in the company of others.
If you’re still not completely comfortable, use a small towel to partially cover yourself. Typically uniforms are available to wear as well.
Come with a friend so that you have someone to talk to, if that makes you feel more comfortable. Some people may prefer to start with just strangers.
Give yourself something to do. Bathe yourself or groom yourself while at the spa, and you won’t be totally focused on your nakedness.
Also, while you're there, try to get a massage too. It'll help sooth your nakedness, and it will also sooth your back!

, If you have a significant other or have a supportive friend or family member, get naked around them only if the other person is comfortable with it.


If you’re comfortable around your significant other, then you’ll be more comfortable during sex or other forms of sexual activity.
Being naked around a supportive person also helps you gain confidence and set aside any fears. No one is going to gawk at you, point or laugh, which is some people’s greatest fears.
Nude massages, for instance, are a way of acclimating yourself to being nude around others. Typically, the parts that are not being massaged are covered up with a towel, so you will have some sense of being covered.

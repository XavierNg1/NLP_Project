 You should drink water during and as you finish your workout. If your body gets dehydrated, you can start to feel tired. Drinking a bottle of water or some water with lemon in it after your workout gives your body the hydration it needs and can help you feel more energized., Stretching your muscles after your workout prevents them from freezing up or cramping. If your muscles feel tight after your workout, it’s definitely going to decrease your energy. Stretch as soon as your workout is over, while your muscles are still warm.A good basic arm stretch is to place your right arm across your chest, place your left wrist in front of your right wrist and press back. Then swap sides and stretch your left arm the same way.
A good basic leg stretch is to sit with your legs out straight in front of you and stretch forward as far as you can while trying to touch your toes.
You can also sit with your right leg out straight, while bending your left leg at the knee, placing your foot flat on the floor. Twist at the waist until your right elbow is behind your left knee and hold the position for a few seconds. Then repeat the same move on the right side.
 A cool shower after a workout decreases inflammation in muscles. That kind of inflammation can cause pain and discomfort later, and a cool shower can prevent that pain while waking you up.You don’t have to make the water in your shower freezing cold, but it should be considerably cooler than your normal shower.

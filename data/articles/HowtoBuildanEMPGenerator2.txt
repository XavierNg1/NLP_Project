 It doesn't have to be anything fancy, just a cheap point and shoot you can pick up at any convenient store. Make sure the film is all used up before taking apart the camera.
 Using the flat edge of a screwdriver, carefully pry the camera apart. Be careful not to touch the printed circuit board or any metal parts inside.
 You'll be dealing with the potential of getting a painful shock if you accidentally touch the flash capacitor, which carries about 300 volts.
 It is commonly a black cylindrical item, with two leads coming out of the bottom., Use a tool with an insulated end to avoid getting shocked. An insulated tool has a rubber grip that prevents an electric current from shocking you. Slide your screwdriver’s tip against one of the sealants by the flash to discharge the capacitor. You should hear a quick pop followed by a small spray of sparks.









Once the initial spark has sparked, you shouldn’t need to redo this. As you remove the board, continue checking the soldered sealants on the circuit board by the capacitor.
You do not need to slide the screwdriver’s tip hard. Don’t damage the rest of the circuit board checking for active energy., After carefully taking apart your disposable camera, remove the board and capacitor. Mark on the battery holder, which side is positive and negative with a marker. You’ll be able to tell because there should already be a battery in the machine.









Remove the battery from the device before continuing.

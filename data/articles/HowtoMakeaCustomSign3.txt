 There are lots of different wood pieces that you can use for making this type of sign. You can go to your local craft store and get one that comes pre-cut into an elaborate shape, like a shield (these are, however, rarely much large than 2' across). You can build a board by joining several planks using pre-drilled holes, properly sized dowels, and wood glue. You can also get a single plank cut to whatever size you want. Salvage wood is also good for this style of sign.
 You can paint the base wood, stain it, or leave it in a natural state. It's up to you.
 Trace your text onto the wood using whatever method you chose from the first section.
 Get some acrylic paint in your preferred colors and paint in the text. You can create a shadow effect by painting the stencils slight down and to the left or right, and (once the paint dries) moving the stencils into the proper position and painting them again.
 You can dd some finishing touches if you want to. The text can be distressed by rubbing it a bit with sandpaper. You can also paint a sealant over the whole thing if you want the sign to be shiny.
 Attach hangers, a string, or even nail on some soda pop tabs to use as hooks. Hang your sign with the aid of a level. Enjoy!

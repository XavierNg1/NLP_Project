 The inner edge of your eyebrow should roughly line up with your nose’s outer edge. Try taking a pencil and placing it along the outer edge of your nose. This will help you see where the innermost edge of your eyebrow should be., The iris is the colored part of your eye, and it can serve as an excellent guide for figuring out where your eyebrow’s arch should peak. The arch of your brow should peak about 1/8 inch or 3 millimeters past your iris’s outer edge., You should maintain a uniform thickness from the inner edge of the eyebrow up to the arch. Once you reach the arch, you can begin tapering the brow thinner until you reach the outer edge of the eyebrow. You can also keep your eyebrows at the same thickness throughout if tapering doesn’t seem right for you., The outermost edge of your eyebrow should not dip below the level of your eyebrow’s inner edge. Keep both edges of the eyebrow on the same level. You can also let the outer edge sit a tiny bit higher than the inner edge., You will be more successful at shaping your eyebrows with a razor if you ask someone to help. A friend or family member can help you determine the best brow shape. They can also alert you if it looks like you are shaving away too much of your eyebrows.

 Bold people capable of tackling any challenge are sexy to women. A guy who can’t do anything and shrinks at the first sense of difficulty is not a man women desire. If meeting women has always been intimidating, overcome your fears and you’ll be a lot closer to being a ladies' man.


Work on improving your self-confidence in this way by owning the fear and resulting failure. Do not blame others for your lack of action.Imagine yourself meeting women, and when you’d normally fold, picture it going perfectly. They laugh at all your jokes, and provocatively reply to all your advances.
Concentrate on proper breathing. Take deep breaths. Breathe out a little longer than you breathe in, and you’re prone to calm down., All ladies' men have been turned down multiple times. Get stronger with each step backwards. Reevaluate your approach, your moves, your words. Instead of focusing on the failure itself, focus on what you can change for a better result the next time.Convince yourself the rejection is really what is best for your future. There are other people out there and you will meet someone who is better suited to you.
Acknowledge rejection as something you’ve defeated before. This is just the same hurdle.
Imagine how you could have been good for them. The ways you would have made them happy, laugh, and love you. They made a huge mistake missing out on you., When you find something that doesn’t work, like a specific outfit, a location, or maybe even the type of woman, try something new. Break out of your routine. What’s more, get pumped up about the change. Motivate and convince yourself the new avenues you’re going to take are going to be successful.Steer clear of women who look like your ex. This is not about proving something to yourself.
Go outside your comfort zone. You will meet a brand new set of women in places you’ve never been.

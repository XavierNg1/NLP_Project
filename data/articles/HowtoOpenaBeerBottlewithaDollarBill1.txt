 Make a hamburger fold, or a horizontal fold to the bill. Avoid using a large bill in case you damage the bill while you practice. Remove any creases in the bill before folding.








It helps if the dollar bill is new and crisp.;
, Lay the folded dollar bill flat on a surface. From one end of the bill begin folding the bill towards the other end. You can either roll the bill or create several tiny folds. Spend some time getting the folds as tight as you can.









Use the surface top to create pressure in the folds. The surface will help you hold the tightness of the fold.
 Bend the rolled dollar bill in half to maximize the pressure at the bend. You can fold the bill one more time to create a grip for the bottle that is secure.The second fold is optional and you can still open the bottle with the first fold.

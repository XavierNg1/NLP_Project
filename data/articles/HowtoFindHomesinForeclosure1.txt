 Most banks utilize traditional real estate agents to sell the properties. These properties are placed on the market like any other. Investors and individual buyers will find foreclosures listed alongside other properties.


When a property is sold through a real estate agent, it is placed on the Multiple Listing Service, or MLS. Real estate agents can access this list of properties on behalf of buyers.
Ask a real estate agent to look for properties in foreclosure on the MLS or through private listings. Some real estate agents specialize in locating lucrative foreclosures for investors.
Note that bank-owned properties may not be listed publicly and may only be available to real estate agents.;

 The three most common places to give an enema are on a bed, on the bathroom floor or in a bathtub.;
, The hook should be from 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 centimeters) above the surface where the recipient of the enema will be lying, so that the enema bag is suspended 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 centimeters) above the recipient's anus. This is high enough so that the enema solution will gradually flow out of the enema bag.


Suspending the enema bag too high will increase the incoming pressure and thus the enema recipient's discomfort. Suspending the bag too low will cause the fluid to flow back into the enema bag, leaving little fluid to reach the colon

, If giving an enema in the bedroom or bathroom floor, place a thick absorbent pad or towel where the recipient will be lying. If giving the enema in the bathtub, an absorbent towel is unnecessary, although you may wish to wipe spills off the recipient's buttocks or legs.

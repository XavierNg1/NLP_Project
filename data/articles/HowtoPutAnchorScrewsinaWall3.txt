 If your picture frame or mirror has a wire-hanger in the back, be sure to take into account the amount of slack when figuring-out where you want the picture or mirror to hang.


Threaded anchor screws are mostly used in drywall.
 If the picture frame or mirror has multiple hooks on the back, be sure to measure the distance between them. Make another small pencil mark where the second-anchor will be installed (in-line with the previous mark, spaced the same distance as the hooks on the picture farm or mirror).
 Because these anchors are self-threaded you do not need to pre-drill any holes.








Although this is not absolutely necessary, you can use a nail to make a tiny indention on your mark. This indentations will hold the tip of the anchor as you begin screwing it into the wall.
 You will have to use a drill to install the anchor. Be sure to hold the screwdriver or drill perpendicular to the wall to ensure that the anchor is installed perfectly straight.


Clockwise is "in."
Make sure you are applying enough pressure to allow the threads to catch. Otherwise, the tip of the anchor will keep spinning in place.Screw the anchor in until it rests flush against the wall.
 Line up the screw and the anchor and, using either a philips or flat head screwdriver, turn the screw clockwise just until the base of the screw comes to rest against the base of the anchor.









If the object you are hanging has a mounting bracket, you may need to slide the screw through the bracket before screwing it into the anchor.
 Be sure to leave just-enough of the screw exposed to "catch" the hanger on the back of picture frame or mirror.

Don't pile the shoes on top of each other, as that might leave dirt or marks on your shoes.
Don't rest things on top of your shoes or rest shoes on their tops. This avoids crushing them.
Create special storage for special shoes. If you have a pair of good dress shoes that you only wear with your good suit, keep them free of dust by storing them in a box or bag.
Maintain the shape of the toe of softer shoes by packing them loosely with clean tissue. Or, use a cardboard, wood, or plastic shape designed for this purpose.;
, You can get the necessary supplies and do the job yourself or ask your nearest cleaners if they clean shoes.
 Keep your shoes away from mud, wet grass, and water puddles, as that might make your shoes dirtier and reduce their lives.
 Wear slippers around the house, and change into them when you can. This will make it so that your shoes don't wear out as fast and make them last much longer.
 People tend not to be careful with other people's shoes, so try not to lend them out, no matter how cute they are.
 Untie lace-up shoes and put your feet all the way in. Untie them again to take them off. If you want to slip in and out, get slip-ons or clogs.
 If you know you will be out in your shoes in snow or rain, apply a suitable waterproofing agent periodically. A good shoe store can recommend an appropriate product.
 There's no sense wearing out the soles of your shoes any faster than necessary, so pick up your feet when you walk.
 Keep last year's sneakers for this year's gardening, painting, or walking on rough surfaces or gravel. You'll get a little more use out of the older shoes and spare the newer shoes premature damage.

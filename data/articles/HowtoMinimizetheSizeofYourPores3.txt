 Remove your makeup and wash your face according to the technique described above. Pat it dry with a soft towel to prepare it for the steam treatment.
 When it has come to a boil, pour the hot water into a heat-safe bowl and place it on the table.


Add green tea, peppermint tea or another herbal tea to the water to get the benefits of aromatherapy as well.
If you have acne, add a few drops of tea tree oil to the water. Tea tree oil has natural acne-fighting properties.
 Hold your face over the bowl and drape a towel over your head and shoulders so that the steam is directed toward your face. Let the steam bathe your face for about ten minutes. The steam will help release the plugs that are clogging your pores.
 Splash cool water over your face to rinse away the steam and dead skin cells. Pat your face dry with a towel, then apply moisturizer.

 In a large pot (big enough to fit all the chili in when it is done), brown the hamburger mince with the onion and green pepper.
 Cook for 1 minute. Do not overcook, as burned garlic is bitter., Stir it up to get any browned bits off the bottom of the pot.,, These can include (all optional):

Diced carrots. They add sweetness and body. About a cup. Add in when you cook the ground beef.
Diced jalape√±o, for more heat.
1/8 teaspoon of liquid smoke for a smoky flavor.
 Cover. Let simmer for at least an hour. The longer the chili simmers, the better. Check and stir it every half hour., Adjust the seasonings. It may need more salt., Ladle onto plates or bowls. Top with sour cream, shredded cheddar and sliced green onions. Serve while still hot.

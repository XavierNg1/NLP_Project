 An unused toothbrush works well for this. Run the soapy brush or sponge under warm water. If you are using a sponge, squeeze out the excess water. If you are in a pinch, you can use a clean rag or folded paper towel.
 Using the brush or sponge, wipe down the cuff and tubing, making sure that no water enters the tubing. If there are stains, use a scrub brush or a toothbrush to dislodge dirt. Make sure to vigorously scour the velcro in particular, as dirt and germs can linger within it. Cuffs are resilient; you do not have to be gentle as you clean. Aggressive scrubbing will guarantee a cleaner cuff.
 Be extremely careful that no water enters the tubing. You can plug the tube with a paper towel to ensure this. You can, however, rinse the cuff entirely. After rinsing, pat both the tubing and the cuff dry with a clean towel.
 The cuff should appear wet after spraying. Leave the alcohol or disinfectant to sit for ten minutes before patting dry to ensure that all bacteria are killed.


Alternately, you can mix 1 tsp. (5 ml) of bleach with 2 cups (473 ml) of water and pour it into the bottle. Shake the bottle and spray the mixture onto the cuff and tubing.
 The cuffs should hang on a clothesline or similar apparatus that suspends the cuff without it touching other materials. The outer and inner cuff as well as the velcro should be completely dry before re-use. Once dry, you can reinsert the tubing.

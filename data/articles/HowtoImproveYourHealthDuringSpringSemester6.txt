 When you are sexually active, you should always use condoms. This will help prevent unwanted pregnancies as well as sexually transmitted diseases. Even if you are on birth control, you should use protection because birth control does not prevent sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia, crabs, gonorrhea, and HIV/AIDS.


You should also use protection if you have oral sex as well. Sexually transmitted diseases can be transferred as well.
Even if you are a woman, carry condoms with you. You cannot expect the guy to always have some with him. This way, you know you will always be safe., If you are sexually active, you should get tested often. Even if you use protection every time, you should still get tested to ensure your sexual health. Herpes, HPV, syphilis, pubic lice, and scabies can all be transmitted even if you use a condom, as they are spread by skin-to-skin contact, not bodily fluids.Just because you get tested does not mean you do not need to use protection in the future., When you go to a party, avoid sharing drinks with other people. You can get sick from other people's germs. Also avoid kissing or getting together with people that are sick, which can cause you to get sick.


Always keep a watch on your drink as well because you may be at risk of it being drugged., When you are young and in a sexual relationship, you may feel uncomfortable talking to your partner about issues, concerns, or desires you may have. In order to keep yourself mentally as well as physically healthy, make sure you are honest and listen to your body.


Don't be afraid to be honest. This is the best way to stay mentally healthy.

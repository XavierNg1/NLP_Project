 Menstrual cramps in the lower abdomen are experienced by women usually just before and/or during their periods. Sometimes they can be serious and indicate endometriosis or uterine fibroids.
 Lifestyle changes that can help relieve menstrual cramps include exercise, stress management, and avoiding tobacco and alcohol. In addition, studies have shown that vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B-1 (thiamine), vitamin B-6, and magnesium supplements may reduce menstrual cramps., Pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, at regular doses starting the day before you get your period may help if your cramps are predictable. You can continue taking the medicine as directed by your doctor for two to three days or until your symptoms go away. If your cramps are severe, your doctor can also prescribe birth control, which can reduce the severity of your cramps., Some studies have found that acupuncture (inserting thin needles through your skin at strategic points) helps relieve menstrual cramps. In addition some herbs such as fennel may help with the cramps as well.

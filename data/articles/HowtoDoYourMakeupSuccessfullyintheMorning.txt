 This clears your skin of any grime or dirt that could possibly be built up underneath your skin.;
, Your skin color is unique! When going shopping for foundation there are different types of foundation basically being powder and liquid. A good foundation should not wear off during the day, and should match your skin color!

, You can skip this step if you have clear skin. But if you have a pimple or two, a good concealer can cover it up! But, it has to match your skin tone! Otherwise, it will look very weird.
 This is when it gets complicated. Based on your skin tone blushes can differ from an apricot color, to a peach color. Your blush is vital! Once you find the right one, you're set!

, This locks in your blush, foundation, and concealer. It is amazing stuff!

, This is where it gets fun! Depending on what look you're going for, the eyeshadow varies. If you're going for a neutral look, go with browns or coppers. If you want to wow people, go with a little bit of sparkles! It's all fun!

, The eyeliner can go below the eye or above, not on the actual lower waterline! This can look very trashy! Eyeliner comes in different forms such as pencil, gel (which comes in a paint pot), or as a liquid (which comes in a container similar to nail polish with a brush). If you are going to use gel eyeliner, you will need a brush, an eyeliner brush preferably. But I also sometimes use a smudge brush for that artistic effect.
 This is a tricky step. Don't fret about the bottom lashes. If you extend the top lash and blink lightly after applying, it will do the bottom lash for you!

, This can either make or break the look. Only go with a bold lip if you know what you're doing! Otherwise it's tragic. Neutral glosses look really sophisticated if you have a bold eye.

 Running into words you don't know is one of the great bogs of speed reading.You're likely to get stuck on words with meanings you don't know, and likely to miss key information. To expand your vocabulary, read more. When you don't know a word, look it up.


If you are reading a certain genre of text, such as a medical textbook, it will help to study basic medical jargon before you start reading.
Reading broadly in the fields that interest you will expand your vocabulary.
 Because you'll always be trading some of your comprehension when reading at breakneck speed, you might want to save speed reading for texts that are somewhat easy or that you won’t be tested on. For instance, you might choose to speed read a book that is written for young adults. Or, you might speed read a book that you need to read for a class, but that will not be on any exams or tests. Another good choice for speed reading would be a text you have read before that you would like to review.


Avoid speed reading texts that you really need to know, such as material you will be tested on.
Avoid speed reading texts that require you to subvocalize or analyze while you read, such as poetry or fiction. You will miss out on the most important information., If comprehension is your goal, then processing what you just wrote is your best tool. After you've completed your speed reading of a text, take some time to reflect on it. Write down key ideas, discuss them with a friend, or just free-write about your impressions.


Don't make marks or highlight the text—this will interfere with your speed reading, and it may distract you from the information you are trying to absorb.

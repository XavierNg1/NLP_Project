 Many commercial cat foods contain ingredients to help hair pass through your cat’s digestive system. These hairball control diets can be effective in some cats, but they are not guaranteed to solve every cat’s hairball problem. You can purchase hairball care foods at your grocery, vet, or pet store., Some veterinarians and cat owners think a grain-free diet is the solution for cats who frequently vomit hairballs. Try a hairball formula that is free from all grains including wheat, rice, and corn., Vegetable fiber can help your cat digest the contents of its stomach more efficiently. Most commercial cat foods only have a fiber content of one to two percent. Opt for a hairball formula that contains between five and eight percent fiber., A hairball formula that contains beet pulp and cellulose might help eliminate your cat's hairball problem. When combined, these two ingredients can effectively eliminate hair from your cat's digestive tract., It is important that your cat stays hydrated while you are changing its diet. This is especially important if you are feeding your cat a high-fiber food. Your cat’s body will need more fluid than normal as the digestive tract processes the additional fiber. Make sure your cat has access to clean, cool water around the clock.

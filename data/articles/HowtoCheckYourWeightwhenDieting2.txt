 Weighing yourself daily is the most accurate way to keep track, and helps some people stay on track and stick to a good plan.However, it's normal to have short-term weight fluctuations, and this approach does make them obvious.Follow this schedule if you can focus on the long-term, and understand that a one-day weight gain is normal and does not mean you made a mistake.
 Calculate your average at the end of the week. Add up the total number for the seven days that you have weighed yourself in the morning. Divide this number by seven to determine your average weight for the week. By calculating your average for the week, you will eliminate any daily weight fluctuations that may be giving you an inaccurate picture of your weight loss progress.If you are menstruating, you may experience monthly weight fluctuations.You should consider other signs that your diet is working. If you are sleeping well, experience few cravings and feel full after eating a meal, your diet may be working.If you are still experiencing a lot of cravings and are not sleeping well or have low energy levels, your diet may not be working., Although once per day is the recommended frequency for dieting, you should consider whether it works for you. Consider whether daily weighing is negatively impacting your state of mind. If it is making you feel depressed or anxious, you may want to weigh yourself once per week instead.Weighing yourself less than once per week while dieting is generally not recommended.

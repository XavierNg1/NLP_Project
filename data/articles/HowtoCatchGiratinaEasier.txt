 In particular, Ultra Balls, Timer Balls, and Dusk Balls (if you're catching it in Turnback Cave). You'll also want to purchase some Potions and Revives in case your Pokémon gets low in health and/or faints during the battle.;
, You should have a Normal/Flying Pokémon such as Staraptor on you, since it won't be affected by either Shadow Force or Earth Power. Make sure your Pokémon are at or around the level that Giratina is, which is level 70 (Diamond/Pearl) or 47 (Platinum).



Heal your wall when its HP is close to zero (prepare for the possibility of a critical hit too).






Use your Normal/Flying-type Pokémon (if you have one) whenever Giratina starts Shadow Force. That way, his attack will lower and the attack will do nothing. If you don't have a Normal-type Pokémon, switch to a Pokémon that resists Ghost attacks.
 Don't use poison or burn, since you risk making it faint before you're able to catch it.

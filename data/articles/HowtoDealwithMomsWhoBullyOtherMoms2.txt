 Bullies seek out people who will give them the response they are looking for. You can stop this from happening by deciding to not be a victim. React in a way that they don’t expect and don’t like, and they will likely move on.


Keep your cool and don’t let them get a rise out of you. This will diminish their perceived power and they will not have a reason to continue the bullying.
For example, if the bully laughs at you, laugh along with her. If the bully attempts to make you feel bad by saying rude things, act like you didn’t hear her—she’ll feel silly if she has to repeat herself. Once you let her know that you’re not going to give her the reaction she wants, she will probably move on to another target., If you have mutual friends with the bully, ask someone you trust to step in. Your friend can ask the bully to stop, or let her know that they think what she’s doing isn’t right. Having another person speak up for you and letting her see that her friends find that what she is doing is appalling may convince her to stop.


Also, ask your friend to step in if she witnesses the bullying in action. Chances are, the bully will stop if someone intervenes., Try to keep yourself away from the bully and the drama she causes. If this means not attending certain school meetings or groups you used to, then you may have to make this sacrifice to protect yourself and your family. This doesn’t mean that you have to stay away forever; it just means you may have to take a break for a little while.


Having to leave a group that you enjoy going to may make you feel that the bully has won. The opposite is true, however, because this means that you are making the right choice for you and your family and are choosing not to allow the bully to get to you anymore. This is the healthiest option for you right now and it takes courage to walk away and protect yourself.

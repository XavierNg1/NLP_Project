, When you first get the gun, some grease will get into it during shipping. Clean it with the cotton rag or shirt.
 This will keep the o-rings which traps the gas in working order and keep all the other moving parts from jamming up.
 Now, we will lubricate the magazine. Apply an even amount of silicone oil in the port where the gas is injected into the magazine and the port on the top of the magazine where the gas is released into the gun.


The magazine is now lubricated to the gun. You have taken the slide off the gun and you have cleaned it with your rag. Now apply silicon oil to the contact points where the slide meets the base of the gun. Then apply some silicon oil to the the spring/ blow-back assembly. Take that apart and spray the inside of the slide.
 Now you have successfully lubricated your gun, put it back together and you're good to start shooting again.

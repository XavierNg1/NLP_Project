 This simple recipe only requires 3 ingredients, all of which should be available at your local craft shop or health food store:1 tbsp Beeswax
1 tbsp Shea butter (unrefined is best)
1.5 tbsp Beetroot powder

, You can mix them all together, although some experts suggest melting the wax and butter together and then adding the colorant after.
 You can do this over the stove by placing a heat-proof container into a saucepan with 1 or 2 inches of simmering water in it. You can also do this in the microwave.


If you choose to microwave the mixture, do it at 15-second intervals. At the end of each 15 seconds, remove the container and give the mixture a stir to prevent it from burning.
 Once it appears to be fully melted, remove the mixture from the heat source and stir it well to ensure that all of the ingredients are well combined.


Keep an eye out for any lumps of beetroot powder!

, You can use an empty lip balm tube, a small glass or plastic jar, or a lipstick mould, if you want to be a bit fancier.
 Allow the mixture-filled moulds to cool in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Avoid taking them out while theyâ€™re still warm, as they might not be fully hardened and could break.
 This recipe should make just over 2 ounces of lipstick, which should fill roughly 13 traditionally sized (0.15-ounce) lip balm tubes.

 Be sure to include everything. If you think it was wrong it wouldn't hurt to perform a second evaluation. Be sure to include all lies, disaffection and failures. The idea is to expose all of your wounds.
, Part of the healing process is to realize what you did wrong and that is where the list we made earlier comes into play. This step varies in difficulty depending on the problems each individual has.
 There are no short cuts. You must allow time to heal your wounds, but have the self-confidence to keep working on recovery even if it seems distant. Time will heal all wounds, but only if you keep working on your recovery.

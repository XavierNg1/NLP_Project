 As you play Clue, you will gather clues that will help you to determine the suspect, weapon, and location of the murder.To keep track of the clues you collect, you should keep good notes and include the initials of the players who have each of the clues you collect. Doing so will help you to get closer to the truth and win the game.Make sure that you check off clues on your detective's notes sheet or write them on your notepad as you collect them.;
, Your opponents will also be searching for clues to solve the murder, so it is a good idea to pay attention to their suggestions. Just keep in mind that they may try to throw you off sometimes, so be careful not to consider all of their suggestions as clues.
 If another player shows them a card, secretly watch where the first person writes the X down on the paper. If he writes it low on the sheet of paper, it is a room. If he writes it at the top, it means he was shown either a weapon or a character.Try to become familiar with the layout of the detective’s notes sheet so that it is easier for you to tell what your opponents are marking off.
Try flipping your sheet upside down to throw off other players who may be watching you as well.
 If a card keeps getting suggested and no one seems to have it, then it may be in the envelope. Make a note of it on your detective’s notes sheet, but try not to be obvious about it. Write it down a little after the name suspect, weapon, or room was mentioned.

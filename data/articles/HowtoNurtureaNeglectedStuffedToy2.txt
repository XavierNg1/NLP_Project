 Glue wrapping paper onto the 'walls' of the box. Buy some felt or a towel and cut a square to fit the 'floor' of the box. You might like to cut off one 'wall' so you can reach things easily inside of the house.
 Make a blanket or find a clean washcloth and place both inside to make a bed. If you would like to, get a even smaller box and put the sheets and pillow inside of it to make it even more realistic of a bed.
 After all, you don't want them to get lonely! If you sew a friend, you may want to make him a little bed to go in the house as well.
 Some ideas include:


A shelf with plastic food (small)
A mini 'bookshelf' full of 'books'Â (folded pieces of paper)
A 'houseplant' (a small plastic tree or flower in a little tin)
Whatever else you can think of!
Remember, don't make their house too crowded or they won't have room to walk around!

, with woodwork!

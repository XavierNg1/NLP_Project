, Let out all the pent-up anger. Think the mantra "Anger, Anger, Anger".


What has annoyed you today? Don't let it vex you any longer; free yourself from it!

, Resolve the feelings by walking out your sadness. Feel your sadness inside.


What makes you sad today? Think several times the mantra: "I'm sad because ...".
 Do this to remove any tension in your shoulders and your neck. Find the optimal way of moving your shoulders to achieve the best effect.
 When walking, turn your spine to the right, and then to the left, several times. Do this gently, and turn your head with your body.
 Think the name of the color as a mantra.


What color do you need now? "Orange, blue, gold, pink...".
 Feel the earth beneath your feet. Think the mantra "Earth" and breathe for a minute into your feet.
 What do you want to say to him or her today? Think of the phrase several times as a mantra.


Send light to the world and think: "May all beings be happy. May the world be happy."

, Do this every day, and you will quickly and effectively relieve tension that has built up in all major areas of your body.
 Fill yourself with light. Think the word "Light" as a mantra, many times over.
 For five minutes while walking, move all the stress out of you, until your mind becomes calm. Rest a while. Let all thoughts come and go as they please.
 Go whichever way you feel you want to. Enjoy it. Observe how your mind slowly becomes positive. You are now back from your pilgrimage into the light.


After each yoga walking session, realize that you have done something wonderful and caring for your physical health and for your mental well-being. Keep your happiness. The light will accompany you through your whole day.

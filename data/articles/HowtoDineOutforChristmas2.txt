 Even if you are going to a local restaurant you eat at often, treat the dinner like a special occasion. Christmas dinner can still be special even if you are going out. Put on nice clothes and make the meal a fun, festive, nice occasion.


If you donâ€™t want to wear dress clothes, you may consider wearing festive clothes. Consider wearing Christmas sweaters or sweatshirts, socks, or even festive jewelry.
 While you are eating, you should think of a few things to do to make sure you and your guests have a great time. Think about some discussion topics ahead of time that everyone would enjoy. Stay away from controversial topics, such as politics and religion. These topics may be uncomfortable for some people.


Consider any activities your dining party can do. This may be something like a movie afterwards, either at the theater or at your home.
 You may be dining out, but the people serving you are spending their Christmas Day working. Even if the meal is expensive, tip your server. Christmas is a time for giving and spreading cheer, so make sure to give back by taking care of the wait staff.

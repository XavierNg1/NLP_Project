 Select Rename… from the menu. When the text box for the folder name is active press Alt+0160. This will create a blank character. This character acts differently than a space, as just entering a space is an invalid filename.
 Right-click on the folder. The folder should now have a blank name. Select Properties from the menu, and then select the Customize tab. Under the “Folder icons” heading, click Change Icon… This will open a new window with a list of icons to choose from. Scroll over and you will see several blank icon-sized spaces. Select one of these to give your folder a blank icon. Your folder now has a blank icon and name, and will not be visible in the Explorer.


The folder will still be highlighted when a user drags a selection box across the screen. It will also still occupy a space in an organized list. The file will also be visible to a user that accesses your drive from the command line.

 Remove all tangles and make sure your hair is completely smooth by giving it a thorough brushing. The ballerina bun is created using hair that is totally slicked-back, so if your hair is frizzy or prone to fly-aways, mist your hair with water to dampen it slightly.
 For this look it is necessary to use a brush to create the necessary smoothness. Comb your hair back into a ponytail at any location on your head. A classic ballerina bun is formed near the top of your head, but you can certainly place it at any location along your scalp.









Make sure your hair is totally smooth before you add the elastic. This may require a few minutes of brushing, to verify that the hair from every part of your head is smooth and included.
Once you are sure your hair has been smoothed, use a ponytail to wrap around your handful of hair to secure it tightly. Make sure that the ponytail is not too loose to allow for slippage over time.
 Without twisting your hair into a rope-like strand, wrap it in a spiral around the base of your ponytail. When you get to the ends, tuck them beneath the spiral and secure with bobby pins.









Depending on the length and thickness of your hair, you will need to use anywhere from 3-7 bobby pins to keep your bun in place. Avoid using more than necessary though, as you will be able to see if there are many being used.
Slide the bobby pins in under the bun, so that you can only partially see the very ends. They should slide under (not over or around) the elastic at the center of your bun.
If you have layers in your hair, you may need to use additional pins to secure the layers to your scalp.
 This style definitely needs hairspray in order to be set completely. Give your enter head of hair a go-over with a strong hairspray, and use your fingers to smooth out all of your strands. Youâ€™re finished!

 Consider personalizing a signature dish by incorporating the venue's name or theme into its title.
 Using lively descriptions that include appetizing adjectives, such as fresh, organic or homemade, can have significant impact on food sales.
 Customers tend to pick from the first 2 or 3 menu items, regardless of the dish or its price. Highlighting signature items with boxes or contrasting colors is another effective method of increasing sales of certain items.
 This is considered a powerful marketing tool, which is why so many establishments employ the happy hour strategy. The idea behind a happy hour is to increase sales during times of the day that are typically slow. Many establishments will sell menu items at or below cost in hopes of making up the difference in beverage sales.
 The perceived value of an item on a specials insert is increased by the implication of limited availability. Regardless of how well organized your kitchen manager is, predicting what customers will order is not an exact science. The daily specials concept is a well-established method for salvaging unused product that would be wasted otherwise.
 The average customer's tendency to price-shop can be effectively countered by "hiding" an item's price within the description's text.
 Stand-up menus encased in plastic may be preferable in certain situations where counter and table space are often limited.

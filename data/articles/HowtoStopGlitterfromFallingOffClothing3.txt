 Hand-wash the fabric, if possible, so that you have more control. Fabric glue is synthetic, so it shouldn't run off when you wash it. However, hand-washing will be gentler on the glue, the glitter, and the fabric. Wash carefully and do not knead the fabric too heavily. Avoid washing in the washing machine.


Use cool or lukewarm water. Hot water can loosen the glue.
 Hang it up on a clothesline or lay it out on a flat surface. A tumble-dry washing machine might tumble the glitter away, as the garment rubs up against other clothing. Furthermore, the intense heat of many quick-drying techniques (tumble-dryers, blow-dryers) may loosen the fabric glue and lead glitter to flake.
 Try to avoid creating friction that might rub the glitter off; try not to rub too hard and scratch on the glitter. Try not to wear it too often; keep it for special occasions, like a costume. The more often you wear your glittery garment, the more often you will need to wash it â€“ and the more likely you will be to brush up against something!


Consider buying a little jar of glitter to repair the outfit as needed. You may also need extra fabric glue. Find these things at any arts-and-crafts store.

 What makes your voice unique? Once you understand the limitations of your range, you can experiment with different styles of singing to bring out the best in your voice.


Perhaps you have an operatic voice; practice singing classically.
Maybe you have a pleasant nasally country twang. Play it up!
Even screaming and whispering have their place among rock legends. Nothing is off limits.
 Singing with other musicians is a great way to get more creative with your vocal style. Sign up for a choir or music club at your church or school, or get together with some friends to start a band in which you're the lead vocalist. You could also audition for a musical or start busking in the subway if you're itching to perform.
 If you're serious about finding your singing voice, getting trained by a professional instructor is the way to go. Voice instructors can teach you how to use your voice as an instrument. You'll probably find that you have a greater range than you thought you did, and your instructor will be able to help you figure out what style fits with your abilities.

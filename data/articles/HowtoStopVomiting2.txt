 Dry crackers in small amounts may decrease nausea. That's because foods high in starch, such as crackers or toast, can help absorb stomach acids.If eating crackers works, you may have been hungry, not ill.
 Remember that, when you begin to eat again, you should start with some simple carbohydrates, such as gelatin. Slowly work your way up to proteins like chicken noodle soup. Save fats for last, as fat is toughest to digest and can disrupt your already weakened stomach.
 Fresh-tasting mints are great as a palate-cleanser and may help reduce nausea. As mentioned earlier, candied ginger is also a good solution to keep the vomiting sensation away.
 Acidic, spicy, and fatty foods are all self-explanatory. Fibrous foods include many vegetables, meats, and coarse grains.


If diarrhea accompanied your vomiting, avoid dairy products as well. Like other foods mentioned above, dairy can be hard for the stomach to process.
Avoid very hot or very cold food. Your stomach has to work overtime to make very cold food warm enough to process, and very hot food cool enough to process.

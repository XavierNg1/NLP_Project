 Really any one will do, but you will want one that is noisy. The perfect setup for a guitar is one with single-coil pickups, two volume knobs and a pickup selector, and preferably a tremolo bar. The amp isn't really important, but before you leave the store make sure it sounds good and can get some good feedback (reasonably good; really loud if you're right next to the amp, nonexistent if you back away).;
, They're not necessary, but you'll find you have a lot more options if you make a solid $500 investment. Pay special attention to the effects that you can control; an effect is an effect, but having control over the effect is what allows you to create rather than replicate. Some good examples are a wah-wah pedal, a whammy pedal (or other pitch alteration device, especially if it has a harmony setting), and a talk box.
, So, do everything and anything you can think of to make your guitar make an odd noise. Don't be afraid of abusing is (see Warnings). A good example is feedback; step up close to your amp and wait until you hear the high-pitched, whiney noise.
 This is where your effects come in. Try out your wah or talk box. These are the basis of the originality of your sound, so be creative. Sometimes, just having them on completely changes the sound. Play around.
 The next step is putting it into a song.
 This is easily accomplished by toying around with a whammy pedal. For a more natural sound, you can also use a tremolo bar (if, of course, your sound does not require the use of both hands). Use this to make a sort of melody or solo, or whatever. It's your sound, do what you want with it.
 Keep in mind that the feedback example is just that: an example. The possibilities are limitless. Try hitting your guitar with something, unplugging and messing around with the cable, whatever. As long as it makes a sound, you can use it. Some other techniques are listed below.

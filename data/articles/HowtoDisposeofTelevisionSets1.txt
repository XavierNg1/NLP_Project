 Most states have laws preventing you from leaving TVs and other electronics outside for trash pickup. Some individual companies also have rules against this type of disposal. However, most waste companies give paying customers the option of dropping off old TVs at a site for recycling.Depending on the company, you may need to show a driver's license or utility bill to gain access to the site.
Most of these centers accept TVs and other items, such as cameras, small appliances, cell phones, CD players, and photocopiers.;
, Many cities and towns have pick-up or drop-off options for electronics and other large items. They may give you one day per month to take your TV to a specific spot in town. Some cities may even pick up your old (extremely heavy) TVs from your home.


Go to your town or county’s website to look for this information.
 In the United States, BestBuy is the only major retailer that picks up and recycles old TVs. They charge a fee for this service, and they limit you to getting rid of two TVs per family per day.Unfortunately, BestBuy doesn’t accept all TVs, especially if they’re super big. Call the store to see if your TV qualifies.
You can also drop the TV off at the store to avoid paying BestBuy’s “haul-away fee.” If you buy a new TV from them, this fee is pretty minimal. For non-customers, it’s about $100.
 Some manufacturers will accept your old television set and recycle it themselves. Contact the manufacturer to see if your TV qualifies for this service. You may even get a little money back in return for your old TV!Usually, you’ll need to find the nearest drop-off site by looking online or talking to a representative on the phone. Be sure to follow the company’s guidelines for proper recycling.

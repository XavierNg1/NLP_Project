 You can purchase compressed air at most department stores or hardware stores. Choose products that use only air and do not include chemicals. Products like Dust Off and Blow Away work well., An iPhone screen is fairly well protected, but you do not want to risk breaking it. Compressed air can be strong. When you blow the air onto your iPhone's camera lens, hold the nozzle at least a foot away from your screen. Dispense compressed air until any dirt has cleared from the screen., In some cases, compressed air will not remove dust from the lens. You can try to wipe it off with a microfiber cloth, but if it still does not come off there is a good chance the dust is trapped below the camera lens. In this case, see an Apple technician. Find a local Apple store in your area and make an appointment.A qualified technician can open up your iPhone and clean the screen from the inside. Do not attempt to disassemble your iPhone on your own unless you have extensive experience working with Apple products. Taking your phone apart on your own could damage the phone and may void the warranty.
Apple technicians may fix the phone for free if you're still under warranty.

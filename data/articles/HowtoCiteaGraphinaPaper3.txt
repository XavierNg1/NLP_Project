 A graph or chart from another source is first labeled as “Figure X,” though you may opt to abbreviate "Figure" to "Fig." Use Arabic numerals (i.e., 1, 2, 3, etc.).Figures should be numbered in the order they appear; your first graph or other illustration is "Fig. 1," your second "Fig. 2," and so on.
 This description serves as the title of the figure and provides your reader with information regarding the graph's content. Refrain from adding punctuation following the description -- the rest of your citation information will be placed in parentheses immediately following.


For example, “Fig. 1. Rise in tomato consumption..."

, For example, in our example you might write "Graph by American Tomato Growers' Association."

, Follow a format of "In Book Title. By author. Location: publisher, date, page number." Your complete citation should read:


Fig. 1. Rise in tomato consumption (Graph by American Tomato Growers' Association. In Growing Vegetables in Your Backyard. John Green. Hot Springs: Lake Publishers, 2002, 43).

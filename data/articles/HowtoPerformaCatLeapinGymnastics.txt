 This is very important, and mandatory.;
, Sit on the floor with your legs crossed. Bring up your left leg to your belly button, and do the same with your right leg immediately. You can also do this with your legs out, and laying down. As you are doing this, you are mimicking the leg movements in the cat leap.
 Try to bring your left leg to your belly button, and after you got it as high as it will go, repeat with your right leg. Ideally, the right leg should be directly under the left. But, for right now, just practice on getting your legs higher.
 They play a very simple role. They should start close together in front of you, move upward into a crown position, and then fall out to the sides. All this should be done with grace, and not sloppy. If you want to practice, try it with a straight jump first.
 Do your arm movements at the same time as your legs. In an ideal cat leap, your feet should reach your belly button, be directly under each other, and your arm movements should be graceful. This might take a long time to master, but that's OK!

, Roll out a piece of duct tape about the length of the beam, or shorter if you need too. It should be on a surface where either you want it to stay, or you can easily remove it.
 This should eliminate fear because you can't fall, but provide a nice practice space, width wise.
,, Congratulations! Now, all you have to do is practice until you get it just right almost every time.

 By being kind to all of those around you, you set a good example and a high standard for the Christian faith. This will make it easier to interact with non-Christian friends as well. Even if they believe differently, your non-Christian friends will respect the compassion and caring that you show through your Christian faith.


You can let your compassion shine when friends are in need of help. For example, if your friend is going through a hard time and needs someone to talk to, you could make it a point to be there and listen patiently. Say something like “If you need to talk, I am here for you.”

, Different points of view may come up in discussion. It is your job to either walk away from the discussion or treat it with tact and dignity. Avoid yelling, being dismissive of the other person(s), and cutting people off. You should also avoid telling people that they are condemned to Hell for not agreeing with you.


Aggressive and intolerant behavior from any point of view will drive people away from you instead of giving them reasons to hear you out.
For example, instead of lecturing someone about being sinful, you could simply say “I don’t feel comfortable being part of that activity. It goes against what I believe.”

, You can get your non-Christian friends to respect your faith by living out the principles that you believe in. Instead of telling people how they should act (Christian or non-Christian), show them through your own actions. Avoid seeking praise for all of your good deeds and instead allow your friends to see your consistent kindness.


For example, you could take on extra curricular activities like volunteering at a food pantry or mentoring younger children.
When asked why you spend your time helping others, you could respond with something like “It is what I believe to be right as a Christian, and I’m glad to help.”

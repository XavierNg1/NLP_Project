 Chapter 13 is good for allowing you to use your income to pay off some or all of your debts. Chapter 7, on the other hand, allows you to keep exempt property and discharge more of your debts, if your income is insufficient to make payments. If you previously filed a Chapter 13 case, but then your income drops significantly and you need to file bankruptcy again, you may be in a position to use Chapter 7 the second time.
 This will start with a petition, schedules and payment plan. Use the ordinary petition and schedules. Work with the trustee, attend the meeting of creditors, and begin the payments as required by your Chapter 13 plan.


For a more detailed review of a Chapter 13 case, see File for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy.
 In most cases, the Chapter 13 plan requires you to make payments for five years. In some cases, this can be reduced to three years. You must make all payments on time in order to earn your discharge.
 This six year waiting period is not as long as it may sound. The six years is measured from the date that you filed the petition to start the Chapter 13 case. It is not measured from the end of the case. Under ordinary circumstances, you may be eligible for a Chapter 7 filing within a year or less from the end of the prior Chapter 13 plan.For example, suppose you filed a Chapter 13 petition on January 5, 2010. You proposed a plan for 60 monthly payments, and then made all the required payments. Your plan would end sometime in 2015 (allowing a month or two for administrative details). You are eligible to file a new Chapter 7 petition six years from the original petition date. This will be January 5, 2016. Therefore, the waiting period from the end of the original payments until the next filing date is only about six months.

 It wouldn't scratch but would pick up any stubborn residual stickiness. It's best to use something normally used on wood, so it doesn't have to be washed off with detergent.
 The transparent Scotch tape labeled "Magic tape" can remove sticker glue without leaving more behind.Lay it over the glue and rip it off once. If there are no significant results, move on to the next step.









You can try other types of tape if the wood is not valuable. Do not use duct tape, which may leave its own residue on the wood.
 If you used a solvent to dissolve the glue, it should work on the remaining stickiness as well. Dampen a cloth with a little more of the same substance. Rub for up to 10 minutes, in gentle circular motions.









Do not do this if the wood feels rougher or looks discolored due to the solvent.
 A mild dishwashing detergent and water may remove small amounts of residue. Use just a drop or two of detergent in a small cup of water. Dampen a cloth or sponge and scrub.
 If the sticker or sticker residue will not come off, sand through it. Rub with 80 grit sandpaper until the sticker and residue is gone, replacing the paper whenever it gets clogged. Restore the smooth surface with 120-grit sandpaper, then 220-grit.








Once sanded, reapply whichever finish or paint was used on your wood. If you do not know which finish was used, you may need to sand off the entire surface and apply a new coat from scratch.

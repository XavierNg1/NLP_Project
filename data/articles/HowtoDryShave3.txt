 Dull razors will force you to bear down harder to get a close shave. This can result in more nicks or cuts. New razors come pre-lubricated and will give you the best results.Select a razor with one or two blades max. More blades will pull hair and cut below the skin. This can lead to ingrown hairs or razor burn. A single-blade razor won't clog up as quickly as a razor with 2 or more blades.
 Use the hand that isn't holding the razor to stretch the skin slightly. Spread your thumb and index finger far apart and apply slight pressure to skin to make the skin into a smoother flatter surface. This will make it easier to apply the appropriate amount of force with the razor.
 Gently press the blade to your skin and glide it in the same direction that the hair grows. Use light, long strokes.


Shaving against the grain will likely result in painful razor burn that appears as bumpy, irritated skin.
Shaving with the grain will not be as close as it would with going against the grain, however you will be less likely to damage the skin.

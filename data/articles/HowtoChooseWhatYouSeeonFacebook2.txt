 Go to facebook.com and use your Facebook account and password to log in. The login fields are found on the upper right corner of the page. Click the “Log in” button to proceed.
 By default, you should be brought to your News Feed page; if not, from the header toolbar, click the Facebook logo button on the upper left corner. You will be brought to your News Feed.
 Scroll through your News Feed and look for any post from the friend, the page, or the group you don’t want to see updates or posts from anymore.
 Hover over the post box and a down arrow will appear on the upper right corner of the box. Click this arrow.
 You won’t see any more posts from this particular friend, page, or group. Unfollowing a friend, a page, or a group doesn’t remove your connection to them on Facebook though; you’re just opting not to see their posts on your News Feed.


If you still want to get updates or posts from the friend, page, or group, but would just like to hide one particular post, you don’t need to unfollow. Instead, click the “I don’t want to see this” or “Hide” from the menu. The specific post will be removed and all future similar posts will be hidden. You will see other updates or posts from them, but not as frequent.

 After your beds are planted, you can give them an attractive edge using stones, logs, or bricks.

For a uniquely beautiful rustic garden border, try making a woven wood garden border.This can be done by weaving pruned raspberry canes along bamboo supports, using a basic basket-weaving technique.
 Giving your garden a rustic touch can be as simple as adding a few repurposed tools and objects.You might try:

Putting a planter in a wheelbarrow.
Lining up some flower pots on an old wooden bench.
Leaning some vintage garden or farm tools (like rakes or pitchforks) against a wall and allowing vines to creep up them.
Placing flower pots on the rungs of a wooden step-ladder.
 A winding path is a beautiful and welcoming addition to a garden. While garden paths can be made with pavers or concrete, a more informal and truly rustic effect can be achieved with one of the following:Stepping stones. This will look most natural if you use unfinished, irregular slabs of stone. Ideally, your stones should be 12-18 inches (30.5-45.7 cm) across, and about 2 inches (5 cm) thick. You can get stones like these from a landscape supplier.
Gravel or mulch. For this kind of path, all you need is some landscape fabric to put underneath your material, and metal or plastic edging to keep it in place.
 Birdhouses are beautiful in themselves, and will also attract birds to your garden. Birdhouses can be installed on fences or walls in your garden, or set on a post or upright log installed in one of your flower beds.You might encourage vines or other climbing plants to grow up around your birdhouse.
Donâ€™t forget to install a couple of bird feeders, as well.

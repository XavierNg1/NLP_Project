The three ways to get these are to apply for a WTR1 Talent Visa (accredited employer), WTR2 Talent Visa (arts, culture, sports), and WTR3 Visa (long term skill shortage).
To obtain a WTR1 or WTR2 Talent Visa, you must be aged 55 or younger, meet health and character requirements, and have found an employer (for WR1) or nationally known organization (for WR2) that wants to make use of your talents.
To obtain a WR3 Visa, you must be under age 53 when you apply for the visa and under age 56 when you are eligible for residence. Your skill must be on New Zealand's Long Term Skill Shortage List.



Do this if the WTR visas do not work for you.
You must have a job offer in New Zealand to get a general work visa.

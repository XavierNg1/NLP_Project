 In rolling credits, the names start at the bottom, then scroll up to the top and out of frame. These are the typical credits in a movie. To make customized credits you'll need to do a little extra work later on.


In some versions of iMovie, you get to the titles by clicking the large "T" under the "Content Library" section on the left-hand side of the page.
In some versions of iMovie, you must click on the 'Title' tab towards the right-middle of the screen. Then, select the 'Credits' option.
You can also try Command + 3 to get to the titles settings screen.;
, If you hover your cursor over the different choices, they will animate, giving you a preview of what the larger version will look like.
 This gives you the chance to work with the credits and customize them for you movie.
 There will be general text, like "actor" or "role," that you can replace with your specific text. Hit â†µ Enter to start a new line and add a new credit.
 If you extend the credit sequence in your timeline (by clicking and dragging the right edge), you'll make the credits run slower and take longer to complete. If you shorten it they will run faster.
 This is frequently done for the first few credits, as the background video fades away. To do so, simply place the titles in the video slot above the movie you want and underneath the credits.Click on the video in your timeline, then double-click it in the preview window. This allows you to resize it and move it, so you could put it next to the credits as they run. You can do the same thing with your credits.

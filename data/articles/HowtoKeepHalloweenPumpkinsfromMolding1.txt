 Silica is used as a desiccant, meaning that it wicks away excess moisture. What causes your pumpkin to start rotting and molding? Excess moisture. The two are a devilishly simple but effective combination.


Check your closet or dresser drawers, as you may have left some lying around from recent purchases. If you can't find any, packets of silica are available in bulk for very economical prices online. Silica packets are largely available with the following items:

Beef jerky
Shoes and shoe boxes
Cat litter

;
, Don't leave any lying around for your pets because, while silica gel itself is nontoxic, sometimes manufacturers add other toxic chemicals (for example, cobalt chloride) to the product.
 Remove the top of the pumpkin. Take a silica bead and embed it into the interior of the pumpkin. Don't stick the bead in so far that it changes the appearance of the pumpkin's exterior.


When applying the beads, use 3/4 grams of silica for every 100 cubic inches of pumpkin.

 Remove every little bit of clothing, even shoes, earrings, and so on.

Now, when your doll is completely naked, place him/her on a towel while you run the bath.
To run the bath you will need an area to fill up with water, so a sink will be best for a MH doll.
Run warm water into the bath/sink and keep it going until the sink is almost full.
Mix in some cold so the water is even.
If you are not in a hurry and you really want to pamper your doll, then why not pour some bubble-bath in? (Trust me- your doll will love you forever);
, If you are bathing Lagoona, then let her swim about a bit. (And even better, if you have Neptuna, she can be bathed too).

When your doll is done swimming, get a sponge and a little bar of soap and just rub a little amount of soap onto the sponge.
Make sure you mix lots of water in the sponge, before gently scrubbing your doll, removing dirty marks.
 If her hair is really long, like Abbey, Spectra or Lagoona, or even Rochelle, then use conditioner.

Get some shampoo, and rub a very small amount of shampoo onto her hair.
Massage it in for a little while, then rinse it off.
Make sure every sud is gone, before taking her out of the 'bath' and placing onto a big, fluffy towel.
Unplug the sink and let the water drain out, whilst drying him or her.
Make sure you dry all the bits between the legs, arms and, yes... Bottom... Then, if your doll is a girl and you washed her hair, dry it a little.
 then give her hair a quick rubbing, dress him or her again, and then, well done! You have just bathed your doll!

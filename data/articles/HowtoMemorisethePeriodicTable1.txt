 This will be your Bible for the next couple of weeks. Wherever you go, it will go with you. It's advisable to print out more than one copy. You can highlight and code one however you want and use the next to start over or check if your devices have worked.


Print out a copy. Then, especially if you're a visual or kinesthetic learner, copy it down yourself. It's easier to know the ins and outs of something you've done yourself; the chart will seem less foreign if it's made by you.;
, Most charts are already divided by color and type of element, but if that's not working for you, find your own way. You could go by row, column, atomic weight, or simply easiest to hardest. Find patterns that stick out to you.
 Try learning the periodic table when not much else can be done, e.g. traveling by public transport or just waiting in the line for something. If you don't have the chart handy (which you should), go over it in your head, concentrating on the ones that are eluding your memory.


Stick with it! Learn a few every day and always review the old ones! If you don't review and quiz yourself, you will forget.

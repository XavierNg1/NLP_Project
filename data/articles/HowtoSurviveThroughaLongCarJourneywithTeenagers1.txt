 The last thing you want is to be sitting on toys and/or sweet wrappers.;
, In the bag put some books/comic books, magazines, Nintendo DS., PSP and any other portable games. Also pack some magnetic board games so pieces don't slide everywhere. If you have a laptop, you should bring that to play games/watch movies.


If you have a car DVD player, bring some movies.
You may want to bring a pillow and a travel blanket/snuggie for each person.
Any medication anyone might need (such as Advil) should be in here.
 Include their favorite snacks and drinks, sweets and fruit. Don't add in salty foods as they can make you thirsty. And remember napkins/utensils!


Packing containers full of leftovers and some plates/forks works well too.
This is not necessary if you plan to stop for lunch/dinner.
 Try wearing leggings and an over sized top, as this will be easier to sleep in. You can even wear your pj's. And why not bring along your slippers, especially when it's cold?

 Heat until the water is warm but not hot or boiling. You do not want to use boiling water because then you will have to wait for it to cool before you can use your hands to mix the slime.


You can also pour the water into a microwave-safe bowl and place it in the microwave for 45 seconds to 1 minute to heat up the water.;
, Add three to four drops of green food coloring until the water is about a shade darker than you want the slime to be. When you make the slime, the color will be diluted slightly. Mix the water well with a spoon.
 Cornstarch is known as cornflour in the UK and elsewhere. Place it into a separate large-sized bowl.
 Pour the colored water in slowly. Use your fingers to mix the ingredients together. Thoroughly blend the mixture into the consistency of a thick paste.
 You can add more cornstarch if the slime is too thin. Add more warm water from the amount remaining in the pan if the mixture is too thick. This is a matter of personal preference.









Keep doing this as much as needed to obtain a mixture that is of the right slimy consistency for your needs. You should be able to put your fingers into the mixture easily. When you run your finger along the slime's surface, it should feel dry.
 You can use rubber worms, plastic insects or eyeballs, etc. This is a great idea for a Halloween party, a science party or for a party or camp based on nature or environmental themes.
 Seal the bag well to preserve it.

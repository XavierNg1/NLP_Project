,, Then select the middle layer.
 This example will adjust the Hue/Saturation of the middle layer. If you cannot see your changes, this means that the top layer is visible. If this is the case then click on the eye next to the top layer to remove it from view.
 To add a mask go to the bottom of the layers pane and click on ‘Add Layer Mask’.
, To do this, click on the paint brush tool and make the colour black. This will erase the background from the top layer. If you go wrong you can either undo the mistake or go over it in white. If you would like a partial view then make the colour a tone of grey.
 You have now successfully replaced the background of your image. If you are happy with your changes then you can flatten the image to make one layer. However, this will mean you cannot adjust it again. To do this click on the menu button in the top right corner of the layers pane and select ‘Flatten Image’.

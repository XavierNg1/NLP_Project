 You’re apple shaped if you’re full in the waist, but your arms and legs are thin.
 Deep v necklines create a vertical line that will detract attention from the widest part of your waist. Go for bodices that are accented at the neckline with beading or embellishments. Ornamented bodices can visually add weight up top.
 High waistlines, like the type you will find with cinched waists, are your best bet with an apple-shaped body. High waistlines will flow into the skirt, helping to give you an elongated figure., Flared skirts that turn into an A shape will take away from the weight at your waist.
 They will accentuate the widest part of your body and contribute to a visual feeling of disproportion.

 If you can, avoid drinking alcohol at all. If anyone offers you a drink, politely turn them down. You can still have fun without drinking. Enjoy virgin/non-alcoholic drinks instead.;
, If you're going out with some friends, make sure that one of you is the designated driver and stays sober the entire night. Make a deal with your friends to switch the designated driver role every year or after every party you attend to keep things fair.
 By doing this, you can drink all you want and without the stress of driving home - you're already there!

, That way you can have some drinks and walk home afterwards. You're staying off the roads and keeping others safe.
 Take the bus, the subway, etc. home instead of driving.


Do some research on free transit in your city. If you live downtown or in a metropolitan area, some cities offer free public transit on New Year's Eve.
 If you and your friends are planning on drinking, call a cab and split the cost between everyone. Doing this will ensure that everyone gets home safely.
 For example, if you live in the USA, depending on your state & city, AAA might be able to give you a free ride home, or even drive you in your own car, regardless of if you're an AAA member. Check here for a list of safe ride programs across the country. Program their phone numbers into your phone ahead of time.


Another example would be Operation Red Nose, stationed in British Columbia, Canada, who will drive you home in your car for free.

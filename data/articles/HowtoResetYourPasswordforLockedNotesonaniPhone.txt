 This is the grey gear icon on your iPhone's home screen.;
, It's in the fifth group of options on this page.
 You should see this option in the middle of your screen.
 It's at the bottom of the screen. Resetting your password won't change the password for existing locked notes, but it will update your password for future notes.
 Your Apple ID password is the one you use when making purchases in the App Store or logging into iCloud.
 This will be at the bottom of the screen.
 Your new password has to be different than your old one.
 Doing so will verify that both this field and the "Password" field entries match up.


If your passwords don't match each other, you'll be alerted when you try to save your changes.
 While optional, Apple recommends that you add a hint because--other than your Touch ID--there is no way to retrieve locked notes when you've forgotten your password.
 If you don't, you'll need to slide the Use Touch ID switch left to the "Off" position.
 This is in the top right corner of your screen. After doing so, your Notes password will be reset.

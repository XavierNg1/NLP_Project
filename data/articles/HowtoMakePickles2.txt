 Here's what you'll need to make simple pickles:


4 medium cucumbers
4 onions
Salt
2 cups sugar
1 cup vinegar
2 tbsp. chopped fresh parsley

, Peel the skin off the cucumbers and slice them into thin medallions. Dice the onions into small pieces.
 Lay down a layer of cucumbers followed by a layer of onions. You can use a fork to evenly distribute the onions over the pickles. Lightly salt the layer and then add another layer of cucumbers and onions and salt it again. Continue to layer the cucumbers and onions until you've used up all of the vegetables.


The container should be at least 1 foot (0.3 m) x 9 inches (30.5 x 22.8 cm) and should be at least half a foot (15.2 cm) tall. These dimensions will help the cucumbers absorb the juices.
 Seal the container and refrigerate overnight, letting the cucumbers release their moisture.
 To make pickling liquid, simply mix together two cups of sugar, one cup of white vinegar, and 2 tablespoon (29.6 ml). chopped fresh parsley in a saucepan. Cook this mixture on a stovetop until the sugar dissolves into the mixture.
 Remove the cucumbers from the refrigerator and drain off the excess liquid. Then pour the hot sugar syrup over top of the cucumbers and return them the refrigerator. The pickles will be ready to eat the following day. They will store in the refrigerator for several weeks.
 Remove the pickles from the refrigerator the next day and eat them as a salad, put them on a sandwich, or eat them as a side dish to a main course.

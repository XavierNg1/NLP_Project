 Sometimes you can make it foggy looking, if you want to add fog in a landscape picture.;
,, Take the cloth, put it over the lens, and tie a rubber band around it to keep it in place. Make sure it looks good by checking what it looks like through your viewfinder before you take the picture.
 Liquid laundry detergent will usually glow blue; in black and white photography it looks interesting too. Glow-in-the-dark markers or makeup would be neat. Try toothpaste, anything that you can think of that might look neat, pour it on an object or even try stuff out on a willing model.
 You've probably seen them, the whole picture's black and white but certain things like a dress, or a rose or whatever. Take a picture that would be interesting to hand tint, get it printed on matte photo paper in black and white, then buy a cheap watercolor set (from dollar tree or somewhere) and pick parts out to paint. The more water you use the more see through the paint on the pictures will be, the less water the more the paint will be darker. You can even get a dual tone effect by picking one color to paint over the whole pick, but make sure its watery.
 Pick a scene to photograph, get up close, and make sure you don't get the edges of the TV. You can mess with the settings on the TV for more interesting effects. You might want to try this one on digital, because of weird lighting. You don't want an over exposed image.
 Use mirrors for reflections.
 Then take sharpies to it and have fun! It's even better when you over-expose the picture.

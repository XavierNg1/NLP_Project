Do this before showing the trick to anyone., In front of your audience, split the deck into two piles. Attempt to be casual and separate the piles by colors. One way you could do this is to have one of the cards poking out. This will indicate the halfway mark of the deck., Have the audience member choose one of the piles. After selecting a pile, fan out the cards and have them select a card. Have them memorize the card and slip it into the other pile., Spend some time shuffling the pile of cards that they put the card in. You want to show them that you are being thorough. Don’t worry about losing the card because it will be the only card of a different color., Now quickly skim through the cards without the spectator seeing. It is crucial that the audience doesn’t see that you rigged the deck. Select the card that stands out in color and proclaim a magic phrase like “Shazam.”

 This will help distinguish you from the crowd, as well as show your crush that you have a cool sense of fashion. It may impress them and perhaps even be the opening for a conversation. Be sure that your clothes complement your body type and that your colors match. Although you don't have to wear expensive clothing, make sure that you have ones of good quality.;
, It's important to seem as appealing as possible so that your crush may take an interest in you. Take care of your personal hygiene, such as showering, brushing your teeth, and washing your face to get rid of grime. Add a subtle but pleasant scent by using deodorant, cologne, or body spray. Be sure that your hair is styled neatly, but make sure that you don't add too much product; otherwise, it'll weigh your hair down and give it a false or grimy appearance.
 Be sure to adjust your body so that you appear open and inviting. Make sure that you're not positioned in a manner that may seem closed off or discourage your crush from talking to you (ex: arms crossed). You could also show some "subconscious" indications that you're interested in your crush.
 Confidence can completely change a person's appearance and help them seem more attractive. It shows that you're proud of who you are and that you aren't afraid to be unique. Although you should avoid being cocky, be sure that you give off a confident, cheerful air.

 For the best chance of saving the kitten, you should seek veterinary care sooner rather than later. If possible, you should bring the entire litter in for examination to rule out a litter-wide health issue. The queen, or litter mother, should also be examined by the vet., It’s possible that the mother and fading kitten have different blood types. If this is the case, nursing is impossible. Without the ability to nurse, the kitten is prone to malnutrition and infections.If the mother and kitten have different blood types, the kitten will need to be bottle or intravenously fed.
 The vet should administer a blood test and bacterial culture to identify an infection or infestation. Fading kitten syndrome can be due to a variety of viral or bacterial infections. Internal and external parasites can also compromise a newborn kitten’s health.Improper nursing or failure to nurse can increase the risk of infection and infestation. During the first few weeks after giving birth, the mother passes protective antibodies through colostrum, which is a fluid the kittens ingest when they nurse.

 Some people can manage three, but it is important to keep the hair clean ( depending on your personal taste). Use water which is comfortably warm ( avoiding a too hot temperature) and massage a small amount of shampoo over all the hair. Whilst rinsing out, the water should be clear.;
, Doing this helps keep this area soft and prevents the ends from being dried out. It is important not to apply conditioner at any time to the upper half of your hair or roots as natural oils are already produced here to condition. Using even more in this particularly sensitive area can cause the hair to feel weighed down.Â 

, Those with very curly or dry hair may find that hair masks work better for them if used more frequently to help moisturize the hair. If you hair is fine, every fortnight should be enough. Apply in the same way as conditioner, yet wait 5 minutes to give the mask a real chance to work.
 For example, shampoos with plant extracts to enhance color or with ingredients to improve strength. Also, vary your styling products. A little less than a handful of mousse can boost volume and some serum dabbed onto the hair after styling can help with texture. These would suit fine hair better than heavy gels or waxes. A quick mist of hairspray can keep odd hairs in place.
 Every few months is fine, and even a simple trim is sometimes more preferable. You don't have to always change your cut for nice hair, after all.
 Not as a drastic solution, but foods such as fish, vegetables or those with extra protein ( like yoghurt) are known to help with the shine of hair, as well as drinking enough water.

 If there is surface dirt on the felt, gently brush it away with a soft bristled toothbrush. Brush only in one direction. Don’t rub in a circle or up and down. Scrubbing in alternate directions can cause the material to pile up., Dip a cloth in some warm water until the cloth is slightly damp. Press and dab at the dirt with light pressure, making sure not to rub. This may help remove some of the dirt., If there is loose dirt and dust on the felt, you can try to vacuum it away. Use a small vacuum nozzle and run it over the felt. If the suction on your vacuum is too hard, you can place some old panty hose or tights over the nozzle to help.Be careful when vacuuming around beading or ribbons. Make sure they are secure so you don’t suck them off the felt.
 You can clean your felt at home by steaming it. Use a tea kettle or pot and boil water in it. When the water starts steaming, place the felt over the steam. In your other hand, hold a soft sponge, lint-free cloth, or soft bristled brush. While holding the item in place, use the soft tool to gently brush the dirty area.This can be time consuming since you can only clean a little bit at a time.

 When the weather begins to warm and the dormancy of winter ends, the vine will start developing new buds. At this point in time, you should remove any stems that became damaged over the winter. Damaged stems include those that are broken open, dead, or growing fungus.;
, Suckers are vines that run underground, causing new vines to sprout haphazardly. Vines produced by underground suckers can even sprout up to a yard (one meter) away from the original vine. Cutting the vines away at the surface will only cause them to grow back stronger, so you need to dig underneath your original vine and cut away sucker growth from the base of the vine.
 Dig up some of the ground beneath the trumpet vine at the base of the plant. Use a sharp knife to cleanly cut away up to 1/3 of the roots, choosing roots that are smaller, newer, and further away from the base of the plant to avoid causing harm to the vine.

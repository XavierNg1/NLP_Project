 ESRB Ratings exist for a reason.;
, However, use someone you trust. Do not trust more than one dollar with a complete stranger; you're better off not having the game at all.
 This is the easiest way to buy M-rated games. Buy a gift card with sufficient funds and order the game online. You never have to show your ID to get a gift card or to order M-rated games online. Also you won't need a credit card or billing information!

, This is the second most difficult way to buy an M-rated game as most places will ask you for ID.
 Most movie rental places like Blockbuster or Redbox let your parents let you have a copy of the card. They can choose to allow you to rent and buy M-rated games and R-rated movies. If the game is for Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, then you can save it to your hard drive.
 Do you have a friend that has the game? If so, ask them whether you can borrow it (it's better than nothing).
 Return to the game store without your parents and simply pick it up. If they ask you to have a parent with you, tell them that you already have your parents' consent and chances are they will let you walk. If not, simply put the money toward a T-rated game.
 They'll ring up the game without valid ID.
, A lot of smaller shops that sell games don't bother checking IDs like chain stores do.
 They wouldn't ask for your ID if you're behaving Maturely and say Thank when they finish putting it on your library card.

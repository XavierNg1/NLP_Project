 Hulled sunflower seeds — those without shells — will sprout more quickly. If you can only gather unhulled sunflower seeds, collect these in a bowl and allow them to soak overnight. In the morning, toss the seeds then pour them into a strainer. Try to pick out hulls as you go. Do not worry if some hulls remain.;
, Place the sunflower seeds in a large, open-mouth jar such as a canning jar or something slightly larger.
 Fill the jar with water so that the seeds float on top.
 During this period, the seeds should begin to sprout. Wait until the seeds have nearly doubled in size and the sprout has begun to emerge. When sprouting sunflower seeds, always periodically check them so that you do not allow them to soak for too long.
 Make sure to cover the jar again.
 Let them sit in the jar, in a warm or room temperature location with no direct sunlight, for one to three days until they've finished sprouting. Rinse them and return them to the jar one or two times a day until they are done.You can also use a special sprouting bag instead of the original jar. Place the sprouting seeds into the sprouting bag and hang it over a sink or other area to allow draining. Continue to rinse every five hours or so.
 When they've started to sprout and look like little V's, they're ready to eat. Rinse the sprouts you plan to eat and store the remaining sprouts in your refrigerator to enjoy later.

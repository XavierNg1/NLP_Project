 Once you have successfully set the tone for sex, you should be mindful of when and where you ask. Avoid asking in front of others so that you don’t embarrass your potential partner. Pick a moment when the flirtiness is at a high, after a passionate kiss, or while they are looking longingly into your eyes.
 Clearly state you that you want to have sex with them and avoid beating around the bush. Tell them that you want to have sex with them if they would like to and explain the reasons why. Some reasons might include that you find them very attractive or that the two of you have good chemistry.Say something like, “If you’re in the mood, I would love to have sex with you right now.”
If this person is your partner, you might say “I was thinking about the sex we had last time and I would really like some more of that.”

, After you have expressed your desire for sex, and they tell you that they want to have sex too, you can ask them specifically what they would like to do. You will often be able to tell by someone’s body language what their body wants, but their thoughts may be elsewhere. Back off if they indicate that they don’t want to have sex.You could ask them “What would you like to do to me?”
Reassure them and let them know that it’s okay if they don’t want to.
 If they tell you that they want to have sex too, you can elaborate on your plans. Tell them all of the sexual things that you would like to do. Touch their hand, face, or thigh to see how they react and to build some physical tension.Say something like “I would love to kiss you all over if you’ll let me.”

 Take a deep cooking pot and fill it with water. The pot should be spacious enough to hold the cap you’re attempting to shrink without overflowing. Set the eye of the stove to a medium heat and allow the pot to start warming up.You might also be able to perform this step in a sink, though using a pot will give you greater control over the temperature of the water.;
, Heat the water until it begins to emit a small amount of steam. The water should be hot enough to shrink the cap, but not so hot that it might burn you or damage the cap’s materials.Do not allow the water to come to a boil. In addition to potentially causing burns, water that is too hot might cause the cap’s bill to warp and lose its structure.
 Place the cap into the hot water. Force it down until it soaks up enough water to stay submerged on its own. You should be able to dunk the cap in the water by hand, but you can also use a pair of kitchen tongs if you prefer.


If you don’t plan on reshaping the bill later, you can hold it out of the water entirely, wetting only the cap’s crown.
 Give the cap a few minutes to begin undergoing to the effects of the hot water bath. The heat will cause the cotton fibers that the cap is made of to constrict and cling more tightly together, effectively shrinking the entire hat.Soak the cap until the fabric of the crown begins to “billow” a bit; this is a sign that it has loosened up sufficiently to be refitted.
 Safely remove the cap from the hot water and shake it remove excess liquid. Once the hat has cooled, place it on your head and wear it until it dries through. The damp hat will be extremely pliable, and as it dries it will conform to the shape of your head.Drying a hat this way will likely take all day. For best results, heat the cap early in the day and then wear it as you go about your business.
Hang the hat up by the bill overnight using a clothespin to prevent stretching or warping as it continues to dry.

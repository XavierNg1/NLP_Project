 Electric current, represented by I, which is measured in amps (A), can be found by dividing power in watts (W) by the volts (V) of voltage. This is represented by the following formula:


I(A) = P(W) / V(V)Or, more simply: Amps = Watts / Volts;
, Power factor is a ratio representing the real power used to do work and the apparent power supplied to an alternating current circuit, a value ranging from 0 to 1. Therefore, power factor is your real power P, in watts, divided by your apparent power S, measured in Volt-amper (VA), or:


PF = P / S, Apparent power can be calculated by
S = Vrms x Irms

where S is the apparent power in Volt-amper (VA), Vrms is your root mean square voltage and Irms is your root mean square current, both which can be found by solving the following:


Vrms = Vpeak / √2 in volts (V)
Irms = Ipeak / √2 in amperes (A)

, Your single phase current will be represented by I and measured in amps (A), and can be calculated by dividing the real power (P) measured in watts (W) divided by a power factor (PF) multiplied by the root mean square (RMS) voltage as measured in volts (V). This is represented by:


I(A) = P(W) / (PF x V(V)Or, more simply: Amps = watts / (PF x Volts)

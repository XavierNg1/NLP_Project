, Sprinkle alcohol or fruit juice over the cake. Wrap in a plastic bag and leave to moisten for 2-3 days.
 Put the lid on firmly and leave to sit for 2 days. When you open it again, you will find the moisture from the bread has transferred to the cake. Throw the bread away.
, Make simple syrup from 60g/2 oz sugar dissolved in 3 tablespoons of water and 2 tablespoons of cognac or fruit juice. Brush the syrup over the sponge cake, then add a creamy or mousse filling and fruit.
 Serve in a bowl with brandy butter; it is a great substitute for fruit pudding.

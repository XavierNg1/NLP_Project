 In Publisher 2003 and 2007, this is called a picture frame, while in Publisher 2010, it's called a picture placeholder.


In Publisher 2003, select "Picture Frame" from the Objects toolbar.
In Publisher 2007, select "Picture" from the Insert menu and then select "Empty Picture Frame" from the Picture submenu.
In Publisher 2010, select "Picture Placeholder" from the Illustrations group in the Insert menu ribbon. You can select a frame style for your picture from the Picture Styles group in the Picture Tools Format ribbon.
 When the picture frame or placeholder appears in your publication, it is surrounded by a set of sizing handle dots. When you place your cursor over any one of these dots, it changes to a 2-headed arrow. By holding your left mouse button down and moving your cursor toward the center of the frame, you make it smaller. If you instead move your cursor away from the center of the frame, you make it larger.
 You do this in Microsoft Publisher's Insert Picture dialog, which lists the folders on your computer. You navigate to the folder that contains the photo you want to insert in your publication. How you access the Insert Picture dialog depends on your version of Publisher.


In Publisher 2003, select "Picture" from File.
In Publisher 2007, either select "From Fileï¿½" from the Picture submenu of the Insert menu or click the "Insert Picture" button on the Picture toolbar.
In Publisher 2010, select "Picture" from the Objects group in the Home menu ribbon, from the Illustrations group in the Insert menu ribbon, or from the Insert group on the Picture Tools Format ribbon.
 Embedded pictures become part of the destination publication file; if you change the original picture in another program, you won't see the changes in the embedded copy. You can also move the original picture to a different location on your computer, and the picture will still appear in the publication. Linked pictures are connected to, but not physically part of, the destination publication file; any changes you make to the original picture in another program will appear in the publication file as soon as you open it. If you move the linked picture to a different location on your computer, it will not appear in the publication file until you re-establish the link. Linked photos do not increase the file size of the publication file, while embedded photos do.


To embed the photo in your publication, choose "Insert" from the Insert dropdown button on the Insert Picture dialog.
To link the photo to your publication, choose "Link to File" from the Insert dropdown button on the Insert Picture dialog.
You can omit the first 2 steps and simply open the Insert Picture dialog and choose a photo to insert; however, the photo will appear in its full size in the center of your publication, and you will have to move and resize it as necessary.

 Heat rash develops when the sweat ducts in your skin get clogged. When this happens, instead of evaporating, sweat gets trapped beneath the skin and leads to skin rash.Heat rash occurs most often in hot and humid conditions.
Keep your body dry by avoiding outdoors during the hottest time of the day.
Use an air conditioner.
Take a shower to cool down or apply cool, wet towels over overheated areas.;
, The heat emitted from your body coupled with the warm weather is likely to cause rashes around certain parts of the body with the most sweat glands, such as around the armpits.Instead of exercising outside during hot weather, go to an air conditioned gym.
Take a cool shower immediately after exercising.
 Clothes that fit snugly are likely to irritate the skin and cause rashes by trapping heat emitting from the body.Allow your skin to breathe and wear light, loose clothing. This goes for babies, too. Don't over-dress or bundle up your baby in hot weather.
The exception is during exercise. Wearing fitted exercise clothing that is designed to wick away sweat and excess moisture can help prevent heat rash, especially during very active exercise such as cycling and running.
 Your body requires water to function properly and what is lost during sweating needs to be replenished.Drink water throughout the day to prevent dehydration.
Drink at least two to four glasses (16-32 ounces) of cool fluids each hour.

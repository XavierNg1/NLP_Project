 This can be caused by a few different issues, the most common being bullets of a shape that don't function well in a particular firearm, but clearing it is the same, regardless. If the pistol is "jammed," that means the next cartridge has been stripped from the magazine, but didn't make it into the chamber in the proper way.
, If the loose cartridge did not fall out when you removed the magazine, pull back on the slide (or open the action) and tip the gun, to shake out the loose cartridge (do not re-use that cartridge if it has been deformed).

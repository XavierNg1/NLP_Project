 Though you may be tempted to pull all-night study sessions and skip out on sleep, not getting enough sleep can be detrimental to your health and to your ability to recall what you studied the night before. Try to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep a night, even during finals, to ensure your body does not become overworked and worn out.You should also try to plan out your study schedule so you can avoid pulling “all-nighters.” Staying up all night will likely only make you more distracted and unable to concentrate during your exam or test the next day.
 You should also take time to take care of yourself and have some “me” time during finals. Doing self-care can help you feel less stress and anxious and allow you to study with renewed focus. You should try to schedule in a little self-care at least two to three times a week during finals so you can take a second to breathe and relax.You may do a quick self-care session, such as applying a face mask and relaxing for 10-15 minutes or lighting your favorite candle and doing a quick meditation before an exam. You can also treat yourself to a bath, a relaxing shower, or a chill out session where you listen to music in your room.
 Your university or college will likely have events on campus for students during finals. There may be fun activities like a finals morning bike ride or a late night yoga session. You should take advantage of the activities on campus during finals and try to attend them. Doing something fun with other students on campus can help you stay fit and feel healthy. You can also bond over the stress of finals and have a few laughs before you get back to studying.

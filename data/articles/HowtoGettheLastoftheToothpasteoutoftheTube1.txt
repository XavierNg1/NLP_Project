 To begin, heat some water in a pot on your stove or using an electric kettle. The water should be hot, but not boiling. Then transfer the water to a bowl., Stand the tube of toothpaste on its cap, submerged in the bowl of hot water. (You may need to lean it against the edge.) Be sure that the cap is screwed on tightly., In order for this process to work, you will want to let this sit for three to five minutes. You can set a timer for yourself, or put on a song this length to pass the time., After the toothpaste has been warmed up, it should exit the tube quickly and easily. Simply squeeze the tube as you normally would and use the last bit of toothpaste.You may want to squeeze any excess toothpaste into a glass jar or Tupperware container; otherwise you may need to repeat this process.

 When the trail is wet, you aren't going to be able to stop as fast as on a dry surface, so allow for more time to stop. Looking ahead allows you to apply the brakes more gradually.;
, If you use your index finger to brake, you can keep your other fingers on your handle bars to steer. Also, by using one finger rather than your entire hand, you are less likely to slam on the brakes and lock up.
 In your car you probably have anti-lock brakes. What anti lock brakes do is they slow down the wheel by pulsing on it so that the bottom of the wheel is at rest, and therefore has a larger static friction coefficient rather than a smaller kinetic friction coefficient. What this means for all you non-physics minded people out there is that anti lock brakes prevent the wheels from skidding. You can do this on your bike by fluctuating your braking pressure to keep your wheels rolling and staying in control of your bike.

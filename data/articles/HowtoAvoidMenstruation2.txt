 Before you decide to go on the pill or go off label with dosage, get your doctor's advice. The pill does not produce natural periods; “menstruation” occurs during the scheduled rest period from active pills and is actually the result of withdrawal.


Since this schedule is controlled and repeats every month, it is easy to alter when you menstruate by skipping ahead a week.
Even if you are already on the pill, your doctor may not advise you to modify your usage schedule for personal reasons alone. Take initiative and be ready to speak to your doctor openly.
 Monophasic brands are more common and contain 2 types of pills: active and inactive (placebo). Triphasic or biphasic pills have different hormone levels each week, and in some brands the fourth week is a low-level estrogen pill rather than a placebo. Your doctor can tell you if you aren’t sure., Take the 21 active pills as usual, and skip the fourth week of inactive pills (monophasic type). Move on to a new pack and continue taking active pills to postpone menstruation up to nine weeks.You can also prepone your period by taking only 7 of the 21 active pills, then skipping ahead to the placebos.This might allow you to get through menstruation well before your event or travel.
With multiphasic pills, take the first 3 weeks worth, then throw out the rest and skip ahead in a new pack to the third phase.You may experience breakthrough bleeding with this method, especially the longer you take your active pills continuously. When you do finally take the inactive pills, menstruation will commence and probably be heavier than normal.

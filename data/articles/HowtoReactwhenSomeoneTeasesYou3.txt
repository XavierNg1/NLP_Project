 Although every bully or teaser has a different reason for why they pick on someone, the reason they all choose to tease is because they see it as a game. When you react, they win the game; when you don’t react, you win. Losing isn’t very fun, which is why minimizing your reaction usually makes a bully move on.If someone is teasing you because they like you, it’s still a game, but not reacting won’t make them stop—rather, it might help them to confess their feelings of attraction and be honest with you.
 You have to understand that bullies tease because it is fun for them. It is an entertainment they engage in to make themselves feel good and forget negative feelings. They don’t always pick on others because they don’t like them or have low opinions of them. Once you see that it’s not always as personal as it sounds, this can make it easier not to let the teasing get under your skin.Ask around about your bully’s background and see if there isn’t something sad about their life. Having compassion for your bully is also a way to stop letting teasing get to you.
 It’s always important to understand that teasing is all about your reaction. When you don’t react, the game is over, and you have won. Bottom line, the best way to react when someone teases you is to not react.

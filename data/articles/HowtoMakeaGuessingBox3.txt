 The objects need to fit in the box, be safe to handle blindly and yet also offer a bit of a challenge! You can have a lot of fun with this part and the possibilities can change every time you play the game. Some examples of things you might like to add include:


Keys, keyrings
Balls of different textures (rubber, yarn, foil, etc.)
Hairbrush, comb, open pot of gel
Candies (gel, hard, sticky, soft, sugary, etc.)
Plastic toys (guess the shape/animal)
Velcro, zipper, buttons, etc. from the craft basket
Cat collar or rubber dog bone
Think of sticky, gel-like, slightly spiky, etc. textures but nothing that could harm a person's fingers.

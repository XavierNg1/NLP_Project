 This makes a bar pop up at the top of the screen.;
,,, You can do this by going to 'options' then 'Game Options' and where it says 'Free Will', press 'off'.
 Shift-Click on the mailbox.
, Then wait a few seconds and a wolf should appear at the end of your lot. (NOTE: this does take a few minutes)

, Then, find it in your relationship panel and drag both bars up to 100%.
 Then, find your Sim on the wolf's relationship panel and drag both bars up to 100% again.
 This makes the Sim best friends with the wolf. (But, the wolf's relationship won't change yet). Then play with it, or something to build the relationship.
 Make sure it can leave (so there's no locked gates or doors) and it should leave.
 It might be the wrong wolf, so repeat until it's the right one.
 It should say 'Adopt' under the actions you can do. If it doesn't, play with the wolf, make it leave and come back. But it SHOULD say 'Adopt' first time.
 Do you want to adopt this pet?' or something. Press 'Yes' or 'OK' (I can't remember exactly, sorry) and you have a pet wolf (:

 With leather shoes, the material may shrink or stretch in response to weather conditions. If you think that this may be the cause of the squeaking, then try applying a bit of shoe oil or vegetable oil to the seams (where the leather of your shoe meets the sole). Be careful not to use too much as oil can stain leather shoes.Use a dry cloth or paper towel to apply the shoe oil to the seams of your shoe. Wipe off any excess oil and let the shoes sit overnight.
 If the heel or sole of your shoe is loose, fixing this may help with squeaking. You can use glue, as long as it's a strong, adhesive variety. Multipurpose glue or strong craft glues may also work. Simply glue the loose ends together and see if this stops the squeaking., You may not be able to fix problems with squeaky shoes on your own. Oftentimes, steel pieces in shoes can cause squeaking issues. Unless you have professional shoe making experience, it's unlikely you'll be able to fix this problem on your own. If your shoes do not respond to at home treatments, take them to a professional in your area.

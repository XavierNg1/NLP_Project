 Your mirror becomes foggy when the water vapors from your hot shower condense and touch a colder surface (like your mirror.) To prevent your mirror from fogging, run your shower water on cold for 30 seconds before switching over to hot. This will keep your shower and the surrounding areas cool, so that when you switch over to hot water, the fog will not form as quickly.Keep in mind that the fog will form eventually, so if you are taking an exceptionally long shower, you may still see some fog on your mirror when you emerge.
Also keep in mind that the success of this strategy relies on the length of the shower and the size of your bathroom. A bigger bathroom will take longer to form fog, while a smaller bathroom will fog up faster. If you have a smaller bathroom, run the cold water for a longer period of time.
 If you’re looking for a very quick and very easy way to keep your mirrors from fogging, simply drape a towel over the mirror to protect it from moisture. If you can’t drape the towel because of the way your mirror is hung, try sticking it to the wall using putty or thumb tacks. Just watch out for holes in your wall!

, If your mirror is fogging up, the easiest way to counteract it is to cool down the room. To do this, open any available windows or doors to allow in a cross-breeze. This will prevent the water vapors from forming on your mirrors, causing the fog to appear.


This method is generally more unpleasant in the winter and should be reserved for warmer months so you don’t get sick.
 If you forgot to defog your mirror before climbing into your shower, don’t fear. There is an easy way to defog it after the fact. Take out a hair dryer and aim it at your mirror (keep the dryer close to the mirror, but not close enough that it touches the mirror.) Continue blasting the mirror until the fog clears up.You can set the hair dryer to either hot or cool, it should work either way.

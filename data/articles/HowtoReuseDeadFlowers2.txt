 Begin by laying the flowers between the pages of an old phone book, and then placing a heavy stack of books on top of the phone book. Leave the flowers like this for several days to flatten them out.This will be easier if the flowers have not completely withered and dried, which makes them brittle. Cull the flowers from your arrangement before they wither completely.
 After pressing the flowers flat, arrange them on an uncut piece of mat board. You can use small dabs of glue to secure them if desired. Place the glass or acrylic glazing into your frame, followed by the flower arrangement on the mat board., To prevent the dead flowers from attracting mold or bacteria, consider placing a small packet of silica gel behind the mat board., Place your foam or cardboard backing into the frame and secure it. You can add glue or adhesive tape to keep it held together. Display the pressed flower art in its assembled frame wherever desired.

 It’s not uncommon for people to sometimes lie about having had sex, especially in high school and college. Since there is such a strange stigma that comes with virginity at these times, a lot of people will lie and say they have had sex, even if they haven’t.There are many, many people who are virgins into their twenties. It’s really not uncommon for people to remain virgins all through high school and college.
 Rather than constantly identifying yourself as a virgin, find your identity elsewhere. Don’t let your virginity be the central point of description for yourself. Remember that you have other qualities and other experiences to share with others, and that sexual history is only a small part of who you are., When it comes to dating, don’t feel like you need to have sexual experience to feel sexy or confident in new relationships. You can still feel sexy and confident while being a virgin.When it comes to dating and intimacy, don’t go into things thinking to yourself “I’m a virgin so I’m going to be terrible at physical intimacy.” Instead, think to yourself, “I’m attractive, confident, and sexy, and anyone would be fortunate to have me as a sexual partner.”

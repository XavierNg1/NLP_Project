 You can determine the game mode by going to the pre-game screen and viewing the goal of the level. From the game map, click or tap on a level to see its pre-game screen.
 Click or tap on the “Play” button to start the level. The main goal will again be displayed before you can begin.
 Each level can have different target for its main goal. In this game mode, the number of gummy bears you need to find is indicated in the upper portion of the screen.
 Start playing the level. Focus on the targets, and do not just attack the game board. The gummy bears you need to find are hidden beneath the jellies on the board. You can only uncover the gummy bears by clearing the jellies on top of them. Once you figure out the gummy bears’ locations, focus on clearing those parts only.


The hidden gummy bears can vary in sizes; they can be as small as two blocks or as big as 18 blocks.
As long as you uncover all the bears, you don’t need to clear the rest of the board.
 Aside from the main goal, every level requires you to meet a certain minimum score to in order to move to the next level. If you’ve successfully completed the goal, but didn’t meet the required score, you will still lose the game. Go for huge combos and cascading matches to get some bonus scores.

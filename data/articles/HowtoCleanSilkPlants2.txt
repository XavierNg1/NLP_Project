Blot the leaf dry and see if any of the dye or paint comes off the plant. If the plant loses color, you should go with a dry cleaning method, such as vacuuming, instead of a wet cleaning method., Use a mix of isopropyl alcohol and water, in a one to one ratio. Fill the mixture in a spray bottle. Spray your plants with the solution to remove any dust or grime. The alcohol will help the plants air dry quickly., Fill the sink with cold water. Then, add a squirt of dishwashing liquid. Wash each petal and flower individually. Swish each one in the cold water and then place on a rack to dry.

Avoid a rubbing motion, which could damage the plant. When you have finished drying the petals and flowers, you can put them back on the plant.

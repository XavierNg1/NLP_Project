 For example a 10 player max table with 2 empty seats has 8 players.
 Subtract the number of players sitting out from the maximum table size. For example in a 9 players max table with a player waiting for big blind, this table has 8 players., If the amount is the buy-in amount or if the amount is a round number, that player has most likely just entered the game and is waiting for the big blind., Check the hands played per hour with other games similar to yours.,

If a table had vacant seats, which suddenly got filled, adjust the player/flop percentage lower.
Conversely, if a couple of players simultaneously left a table, adjust the player/flop percentage higher. If a table had 10 players, you had a 1/10 probability of having the best hand, but with 8 players you have a 1/8 probability of having the best hand. Note: 1/10 and 1/8 are not accurate numbers and are presented here for your understanding. Using Poker Tracker, for a 10 player game, the pots won will average less than 10%. However, an exceptional player could have a 10% or higher win rate for a 10 player game.


Play more starting hands if a players/flop percentage got larger (the table got more loose). By playing more hands, you will be in action more and have more opportunities to win pots. Give action to get action, you will have your share of good hands in time. It is a lot more fun to be in action, however, calculate whether it is profitable to play hands that are break-even or barely profitable when you include tipping the dealer.
Play less starting hands if a player/flop percentage became smaller (the game is more tight). Playing tight, in this situation, will save you money. Categorize the game and when you are in the early positions and especially under the gun, decide on a strategy to enact.
, Eventually the game should become more tight, as the new players will not like losing their money, so until that time play loose.

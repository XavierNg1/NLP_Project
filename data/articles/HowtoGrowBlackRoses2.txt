A partially opened flower may remain darker and better-preserved than a fully open flower.If you're buying the roses from a store and can't find any dark varieties, choose roses with velvety petals. This texture will make them appear darker., If your flowers are already quite dark, skip to the next step. If they're much lighter than you'd like, you can try keeping them in water for a few days instead. The effect is usually small and can be hard to predict, but this will usually make your flowers slightly bluer and darker. Water usually has a darker effect than flower preservative, but this can vary between flower varieties.Try one vase of each if you have plenty of flowers to spare.

 Whether or not you kept your flowers in liquid, air drying them can often lead to darker colors. Hang the flowers upside-down in a warm, dry place away from light. It may take two weeks or more before the flowers are fully dry.
 Once the flowers are dry, a florist spray will help keep them around longer. Apply to the dry blossom according to label instructions.









Do not try to dust the flower first, which can easily damage the petals.

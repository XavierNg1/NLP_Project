 For example, the bottom section of your body should contrast the top. If you want to show your legs, your going to have to cover up top.


If you want to show legs, choose a dark skirt with a contrasting pattern. Don't be tempted towards the bare legged looks, unless your sure you can pull it off and don't go completely bare, try black socks, or dark legwarmers. If wearing tights, choose a flesh look or dark and slightly see through. The most common look in this area is a tartan skirt with black tights.
If you want to cover up your legs, opt for tight, smart trousers in black or navy blue. Avoid jeans if possible(If wearing jeans, choose skinny blue).
For thin slender women opt for the tartan skirt. For larger or smaller women, trousers are better.;
,, The top can be loose or tight fitting, but a tight fitting top should be worn with a contrasting cardigan or scarf, whereas a loose top can be worn by itself. If you have chosen trousers or jeans,the same rules can be applied, except you can wear a more dramatic and plunging neckline.
, Shoes need to stay plain in design, but can be colorful. Red or navy blue is very popular. Shorter women can wear slight heels, but stay away from boots of any type, or sandal type shoes. Taller women may wear heels also, but colored pumps are better. Jewelry is not essential and should be plain. Sliver is preferred to gold. Rule out huge or statement jewelry and no "bling". Keep to small delicate necklaces or bracelets. Many girls feel the need to wear glasses to pull this look off, but it makes no difference.
, Brightly colored or obvious dyes are bad, as the idea is to look natural. Let your hair be as it is normally. Hair can be down or tied up, and clips and bows can be added.
 Wavy hair can be tied or let down, but not over the face. Curly and wavy hair will suit any style.

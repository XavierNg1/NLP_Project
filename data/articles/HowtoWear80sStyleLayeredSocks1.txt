 In theory, you could wear as many layers of socks as you can fit into your shoes, but you should probably stick to two or three. This was more the norm, even for the 80’s, and will keep your feet from sweating too much.;
, In the 80’s, you could easily find slouch socks, which were specially designed to be layered. These long socks had very elastic tops and could be "slouched," folded down, or bunched with ease. They were also made of thin material to prevent the wearer’s foot from getting too sweaty upon layering. If you cannot find actual slouch socks, look for colorful, thin socks that reach up to your mid-calf or higher.
 It was very important to properly coordinate the colors of your layered socks in the 80’s. The colors should match the colors found in your outfit, and each layer must use a different color. For example, if your shirt has white, orange, and red in it, your sock layers should also be white, orange, and red.

 Pour a small bag of frozen raspberries into a pot. Cook on medium heat until they start to melt. Add in 1/2 cup of sugar and stir. Reduce to low heat. Let the mixture simmer as you start the pancakes, checking it every few minutes.


Once you notice the compote is syrupy, you can taste test it. If they are too tart, you can add another tablespoon of sugar until it is sweet enough for you. Remove from heat and sit aside when it is done., Sift the flour and baking powder together in a large bowl. Make sure there are no lumps.
 Crack the eggs in a medium bowl. Pour in the sugar and whisk them together until combined. Then pour in the milk and whisk them all together until combined. Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture. Pour in some of the wet ingredients. Whisk them together. Continue to add the wet ingredients a little at a time, continuing to whisk as you do.
 Melt the butter in a pan. Pour the melted butter into the batter. Stir gently with a spoon until it is combined with the batter.
 Heat a cast iron skillet or griddle pan on medium heat. Coat the pan in nonstick cooking spray or butter. Pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes. You should see bubbles forming on the top of the batter. Flip the pancake and cook for 1 more minute. The pancake should be lightly golden brown on both sides. Then remove it from the pan. Continue with the rest of the batter. Serve with a generous helping of raspberry compote pour on top of the pancakes.


This batter is made to serve four people.
While you are cooking the rest of the pancakes, keep the cooked pancakes on a plate in a 200 degree oven to keep them warm.

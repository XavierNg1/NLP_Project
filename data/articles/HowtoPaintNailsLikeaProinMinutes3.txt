 No matter what you do to try to speed the process up, nail polish needs some time to dry. Exposing them to too much wear and tear before they’re ready never ends well. There are a couple things you can do to speed things up.


Spray your nails with cooking oil to help the polish set faster, and protect against accidental smudging.Don’t use a fan. It may seem like a clever way to dry your nails quickly, but it can cause bubbles in your nail polish., It’s hard to be patient, and while soaking your nails in ice water does make the drying process faster, it always takes a while for freshly painted nails to truly set. Most people smudge their nails at some point in the drying process. If it happens to you, just wet a fingertip with your tongue, and gently smooth over the smudge. The moisture on your finger will help it slide easily, without leaving fingerprints., Painting new layers of topcoat onto your nails as time goes on can help protect them. Apply more a couple times a week to make your nail polish last longer without chipping.A quick-dry top coat is especially good for this.

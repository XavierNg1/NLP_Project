 The diaphragm is the main muscle involved in respiration, and it is located deep within your belly.Inhale and exhale deeply so that you increase the volume of air in your lungs. Focus on your belly: let it expand as you inhale air, and contract as you exhale. Speak as an exhalation of this deep breath to give more force to your words.


This technique is similar to singing from your diaphragm. Whether you are singing or speaking, the amount of breath that you have available is highly dependent upon the way that you are breathing.;
, Relax your shoulders and keep your back straight. Standing up straight allows your lungs to expand to their full capacity, which gives more weight to your voice. Good posture will also help keep your diaphragm open so that more air can flow through more quickly., Take a nice, deep breath, and use this air as fuel for your voice. Do not speak quickly or madly, releasing all of the air into one phrase. Let your lung capacity sustain you through an entire steady sentence.


Make sure that you aren't speaking from your nose. When the air comes through your nose, it can result in a high, reedy pitch that is hard to pick out from the crowd. Try to be conscious of your exhalation., It may take some work to master the technique â€“ but be patient. Take the time to tune into your body and critically engage with your breathing pattern. Be conscious of how your throat, your lungs, your diaphragm, and your belly when you speak. Try it out in a room of people and see whether people take notice.

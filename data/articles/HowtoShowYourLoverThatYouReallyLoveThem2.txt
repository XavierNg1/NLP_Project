 If your lover is mad at you because of something you did or didn't do, learn to accept fault and apologize. By swallowing your pride, you are showing that her feelings come before your ego.
 A wise man once said that trust is a must for relationship. When two people are in love, there needs to be total transparency. By always remaining honest with her, it will allow a deeper level of trust to develop, which allows more room for love to grow., Much of our communication happens through our body language. Be sure to physically show your affection to your partner whenever you two spend time together.


Try holding hands, giving hugs, cuddling on the coach, and giving kisses.
Give a kiss to her forehead or cheek. It is a small gesture that will go a long way.
Look into her eyes during a conversation to show you are listening closely.
 If she gets a haircut, or buys a new outfit, be sure to take notice and give her a compliment. By noticing the small things, she will feel appreciated and realize how much you care., If you feel angry or frustrated with her, calmly communicate your feelings to your lover as to protect her feelings. Anger does not translate as love, but rather as disrespect. It could lead her into thinking you are annoyed and have hostile feelings towards her.


Whether you are teaching her something new, or frustrated once again because a certain chore wasn't done, be patient, and refrain from yelling.

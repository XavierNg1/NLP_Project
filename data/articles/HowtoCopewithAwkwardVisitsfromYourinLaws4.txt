 Once the visit is done, talk it through with your spouse. Discuss what things went well, and what things might need to be changed in the future. Try to keep a positive tone during the conversation so that your spouse isn’t too uncomfortable., Your in-laws may bring up important points while they are visiting. If anything is said that makes you rethink the way you do things on a daily basis, talk to your spouse about adjusting your routine. If the visit didn’t go so well, talk to your spouse about how to improve the next visit.For example, if your housing in-laws caused a great deal of tension, you could suggest that next time they visit you pay for a hotel room.
There is always room for improvement, so consider each visit a learning experience. Consider your mistakes and try to plan ways to avoid them on the next visit.
 Give your family time to resettle before you have company over again. This includes the in-laws that just left. Once everyone is back on schedule and settled down again, you can consider inviting more company.

 There should be slots on the back of the watch that are big enough to fit the edge of a coin. These are created intentionally for easy opening of the watch back., Place the edge of the quarter into the indentation on the back of the watch. If it doesn't fit, use a smaller coin like a penny or dime., As you rotate the coin, the small screw on the back of the watch should come up and the back should disengage from the watch., Use your hands to carefully lift up the backside of the watch. Make sure that you rotated the coin slots a full turn or the back won't come loose.

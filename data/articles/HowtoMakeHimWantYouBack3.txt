 Let him make the first move. It might be hard to wait, but stay strong. A least then when he contacts you, you will know that he was thinking about you and that he's ready to take a step forward in your relationship, whatever that might be. If you push him too soon, he might pull in the other direction.


Once he contacts you, don't play hard to get. Respond in a timely fashion and be perfectly sweet and polite.
After he has made contact, you can suggest meeting up to talk in person. Go for somewhere neutral where you can have a private conversational, but can leave easily if things take a turn for the worse. A cafe or public park would be perfect.
 Sometimes the bad things that happen at the end of a relationship can overshadow all the good that came before. Remind this guy why he fell in love with you in the first place.


Spark his memory by wearing the same perfume you wore on your first date, or a piece of clothing he thought you looked good in.
Reminisce about some of the great times you had together. Make him remember how he felt about you when times were good.
 Don't rush headfirst back into the relationship. Take time to talk things through and make sure the two of you are on the same page. Ensure that you both know what you need to work on and are willing to give things a chance.


Try dating again. Go out for dinner, go bowling or go see a movie together. Spend short, concentrated periods of time together. Get to know one another all over again.
If you try to pick up exactly where you left off, then history is doomed to repeat itself.
 If the two of you have worked through your issues and you're both willing to make a fresh start, be thankful for it. Look on this as a brand new relationship, with no baggage attached. Forget about what happened in the past and focus on your future together.

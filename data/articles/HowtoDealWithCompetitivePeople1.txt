 Often competitiveness stems from a place of insecurity. If a person is bragging about their work, family, or some other part of their life, give them the praise they are seeking. If you give in, you may find that some of the competitiveness stops.In addition, you may find that the praising the person helps them see you as a friend rather than as a competitor.;
, One strategy you can employ, especially at work, is to ignore the person. Pay attention to what you need to do, and continue working hard. If you enter the person's game of one-upping each other, you're only egging the person on., If someone is always taking over meetings to show how much better he or she is, suggest a way to even the playing field. For instance, maybe you could set a time limit for how long each person talks. In turn, maybe you could encourage a way for every person to share ideas, such as going down the table at meetings to see who has ideas, rather than just letting it be a free-for-all., Getting angry at the situation will not help. When you find yourself getting mad, take a few deep breaths to calm yourself. Once you're calm, try to figure out how you can make the situation better. Giving in to anger may only egg the competitive person on., If a competitive person is trying to attack you, you are well within the realm of decorum to defend yourself. If possible, have a way to back up what you are saying.For instance, if a coworker tries to steal an idea, bring up emails that show you had the idea first.

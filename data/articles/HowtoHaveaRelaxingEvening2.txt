Use a blanket if the house has a chill. Use a fan if it’s too hot, or drink something cold. Either way, if you’re comfortable, you’ll be able to relax better., Turn off notifications on your phone and turn it on silent or off. Better yet, put it in another room. This will keep your relaxing evening from being interrupted.

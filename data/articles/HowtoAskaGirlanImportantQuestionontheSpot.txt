 If you know where she is going, bump into her on the way there.;
, They come across as too forceful, or they trip you up by trying too hard.
 You'll probably get a few bonus points (depending on how the conversation relates to your question of course) But, make sure you are not staring. There is such a thing as too much.


Note this hint. If it's at the end of the day and she says goodbye to you, then go for it! She's noticed you there, and she obviously went out of her way to say it.
 Anyone's mind wanders when they see that. If you have trouble keeping a straight face, practice in front of a mirror.
 If she says yes, don't act hugely overjoyed. She'll get put off by it and may change her answer. However, do show some happiness as a mark of respect for her good taste.
 If she says no, then just shrug it off and keep on talking about something else. You won't earn any sympathy points very often unless you two know each other well enough. But how often will she say no and feel sympathy for you after she says it?

, If she asks for some more time to think about it, then don't rush her. If you know you won't see each other for a few days, then tell her your phone number and tell her that if she wants to call even just to talk it over again go ahead.
 Women don't like it when the person they are talking to zones out in the middle of a conversation, especially if you were the one that wanted to know what they thought about what ever you're asking about.

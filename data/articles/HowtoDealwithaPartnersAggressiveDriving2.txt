 There are some situations when you should point out your partner’s aggressive driving and other times when you might want to leave it alone. If your partner is not posing danger to you or other passengers in the car, just try to remain calm. But if you feel unsafe or threatened by their driving, speak up.For example, you might not want to argue about how they stole a parking spot, but you should point out if they nearly hit another driver.
 Instead of criticizing their driving or telling them how to drive, inform your partner how their driving makes you feel. Tell them if you are nervous, scared, anxious, or worried about their driving habits.


You might say, “I’m a little nervous right now. Would you mind slowing down?”
You might also try stating something like, “That sudden turn back there startled me.”

, If you think your partner is distracted or upset about something, confront them. Ask them why they are so aggressive on the road. It may cause them to think about their driving habits more carefully.


You might say, “Is there something bothering you?”
You might also state, “Is there a reason why you’re getting mad at the other drivers?”

, Your partner may be stressed about driving in traffic or arriving late. In a gentle tone, reassure them that you will still arrive at your destination. You might reinforce that being late doesn't matter to you.


You might say, “Try not to worry about the time. We’ll get there when we’ll get there.”
If you have reservations or an appointment somewhere, offer to call ahead to let them know you will be late. You can also call friends or family members that you’re meeting.
 Arguing in the car can make the driver angrier or more distracted. If you feel as though an argument is brewing, try to drop the subject until the driver has parked.After the drive, you might say, "Hey, can we talk about what happened on the road today?"

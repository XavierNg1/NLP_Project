 Different lizards eat different things. In order to feed your lizard properly, you need to know what type it is. Assess the physical characteristics of your lizard and write them down. Then you can use an identification guide or look up images of different types of lizards online using those characteristics. For example, you can use an online search engine to search for "lizard green spotted tail" and see if you find images of lizards that look like yours.Some physical characteristics you can use to determine a type of lizard include size, color, pattern, and body shape. You should also think about changes in pattern or color on different parts of your lizard's body.
You can also take your lizard to a pet store and ask an employee to help you identify it.;
, Once you figure out what type of lizard you have, you will be able to research what type of food it eats. For example, anole green lizards should be fed small to medium live insects, every 2-3 days and geckos will eat meal worms, wax worms, crickets, and roaches.


However, if you can't seem to figure out what type lizard you have, remember that most lizards eat insects and they typically prefer live ones. Try giving your lizard a few crickets, as these are widely available, and see if they go after them. If they don't eat them willingly, you will need to do further experimentation with other insects and leafy green vegetables.
 In addition to knowing what type of food to give your lizard, you need to know how much and how often to give them food. Feeding your lizard the right amount is key to keeping it healthy and happy.


Do some research online and figure out how much to feed your lizard. Internet research can give a base line of where to start with feeding and then you can adjust based on your specific lizard.

 This looks like an open book and can be found to the left of the address bar. Tapping the Bookmarks button will open the Safari sidebar.
 There's a chance that the sidebar will not currently be displaying your bookmarks (it could be showing your Reading List or Shared Links). Tap the smaller Bookmarks button at the top of the sidebar to open your bookmarks list.
 All of your bookmarks will be listed. Tapping one will open the bookmarked site.
 This will allow you to create new folders, move bookmarks around, change bookmarks names and addresses, and delete bookmarks that you don't need anymore. Tap "Done" when you're finished making changes.

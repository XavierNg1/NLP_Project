 Most denominations believe that praying in Hebrew is better, though your god will understand you in whatever tongue you speak. Do your best and He will understand.
 Jews prefer to pray more often and in groups, other than Christian prayer which is more individually focused. Pray with others if you can. This can be at temple, with your family at home, or while you are out with your friends.
 Instead of individually stated prayers said each day, Jews prefer to say blessings for different times of day, events, and times of year. You will want to learn the different prayers and when they should be spoken, as well as the Holy Days which require special prayers.
 If the normal ways of praying are not for you and you feel that you communicate with your god better on your own and in your own way, that is okay. You can pray in the Christian method above and your god will understand. He cares more about your devotion and obedience.

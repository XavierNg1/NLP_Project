 One sweep of a branch removes the ripe as well as the unripe berries. Commercial growers use machines to remove all the berries. This method is used when the majority of the berries are ripe. Though there is a significant amount of waste when coffee is harvested by stripping, the cost is worth it for commercial growers who find this method more cost effective than the time and financial investment involved in selective harvesting. You can strip harvest at home by hand by grabbing a branch and sliding your hand forward to knock all the cherries off the tree and onto the ground.
 Use a rake to gather the cherries that have been knocked to the ground. You can place a sheet or netting under the tree to collect the cherries as they fall. This will make the task of picking them up from the ground easier.
 Separate the ripe from the unripe cherries. Remove any leaves and branch pieces that may have gotten mixed in. The refuse can be thrown out or placed in your compost pile.

 Ensure that your children can't install anything on your home computer without parental permission; children may download harmful programs onto your computer because cybercriminals have disguised them as "games" or fun "software". Remind your children to never send personal information, such as phone numbers or addresses, to strangers. Make sure that your children are aware of which sites they are and aren't allowed to visit. Set a time limit for certain sites, and make sure that your children stick to that time limit.;
, Rather than allowing you children to have computers in their rooms, consider keeping computers in a communal place. This will allow you to cook dinner or read in the living room while keeping an eye on the sites they visit.
 While you want to protect your kids, you don't want to be overzealous. Keep a reasonable balance between protection and freedom, especially with older children and teenagers who might be more mature and cautious. The internet can be a wonderful place with many things to learn. For example, Myspace is a good way to keep in touch with old friends that had moved away and keep up with your schoolmates when you live far away from town. Your kid might have an opportunity to become "known" because of Myspace and it is good for home businesses. However, you must be a certain age to have an account on Facebook, Myspace, and any other social network that contains adult content and dialogue.

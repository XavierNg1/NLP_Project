 Observe that the straw is divided into two sections by the "bendy" part. One section is longer than the other. Cut the longer section halfway between the end and the bend.
 Cut it lengthwise, keeping your cut as straight as possible. You may want to trace the cut with a marker before cutting., Place the cut piece on a folded towel or hard surface, and flatten it with the edge of a spoon., See the photo for more help., Make sure they stay connected in the middle., Set aside the wings for now., As you did with the other piece, use the edge of a spoon to flatten the rest of the straw, except for the bend., Once the straw has been flattened, position your scissors so that they cut through both layers, just slightly inward from one of the edges created by the fold. Cut all the way up to the bend. This will be the "tail" of the bird., On the portion of the straw you just cut, position your scissors so that they cut exactly along the other fold, stopping at the bend. You should end up with three pieces on this portion of the straw - two thick "legs" and one slim "tail.", They should resemble the legs of a tripod.,, You should end up with what looks like the bill of a bird., Position the straw so that the tail is on top and pointing back toward you. Grab one of the legs, and fold it under the tail. Then, take the end of that leg and pull it over the tail and through the loop you created. Don't pull it tight just yet, though; repeat the same process with the other leg., Once both of the legs are in position, tighten them slowly and symmetrically so that they make a knot where the tail meets the bend., They should be at a 90-degree angle from the tail.,,, Flatten it with the edge of a spoon for better effect.,

 Whether or not to peel larger or older potatoes is an issue of personal choice. You don't have to peel but do wash and scrub well and remove any blemishes.









Be aware that it is often a good idea to boil potatoes in their skin as this retains the flavor and vitamins during cooking, and then peel them afterwards if they need to be used peeled.Peeled potatoes tend to absorb more water; this can affect their firmness after boiling.
 Always start with cold water for larger or older potatoes.










Leave the pan uncovered. Covering a boiling pan of potatoes is a mistake many new cooks make, and it leads to a big mess!

, Then drop to a simmer. Simmer for about 15-25 minutes, or until softened enough for eating but still firm. Very large potatoes can take up to 40 minutes to boil properly. Test doneness with a sharp knife or fork.
 Drain gently into a colander.
 Or, allow to cool and cut into cubes, etc., for use in potato salad or any other recipe you're following.

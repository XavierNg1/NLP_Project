 This free app gives you a Terminal that you can use to perform system commands on, including the ping command.
 You'll be greeted with a traditional Unix terminal interface.
 The terminal will send a single ping to the address you entered. You can change c1 to any number to indicate how many pings you want to send, but you'll only need one to find the IP address.
 You'll see the website's IP address in the terminal after running the ping command. If the website is protected by a VPN or content distribution network (and most are), you won't be able to find the real IP address.

 Some networking adapters may work on it but if you encountered any problems, xbox tech support won't be able to assist you with some troubleshooting since they don't support any product other than the xbox networking adapter.;
,


To test the connection, go to the system area on your xbox live dashboard then go to network settings and select test xbox live connection.
If you pass on all test down to NAT then it means you are connected already and you can now enjoy playing online.
If you fail on the first part of the test which is Network Adapter or if it says not connected on Wireless Network then you need to perform some steps.
Get back to the network setting's area by pressing B on your controller and select restore to factory defaults. Doing this will restore the xbox live settings to default and you need run another test again which may allow you now to pass.
If you still fail on wireless network then it means that you need to set your console to wireless mode by going back to Network Settings and selecting the Edit Settings option.
 If you notice, everything on that list is not set. This is why you will set it to wireless mode.



If you are required to enter a WEP or a WPA key then try to enter it and make sure you enter it correctly or else you will fail on IP address.
If you don't know your WEP or WPA key then try to contact your router support to verify how you can get it.
If you don't have any security set up on your router then it will not ask you for a WEP key and you should be able to connect to your router correctly.
Wait till you pass on all parts of the test and once it reached the NAT or you are prompted to download an update then that means that you're good to go.
If you fail on any part of the test then you can contact xbox tech support for more help.

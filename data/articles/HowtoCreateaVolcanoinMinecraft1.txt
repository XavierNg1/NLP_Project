 Beginners might want to take an existing mountain and make it your volcano, but making your own mountain is easy as well. You'll need the following blocks:


Cobblestones (to make the base of the pyramid)
Lava
Red Stone Torches (Optional)
Sticky Pistons (Optional)
Fireworks (Optional);
, Start by setting up a basic pyramid, which is much easier to build. To do it, build a large square or circle. On top of this square, put another outline of blocks, moved in one space to the center. Keep making these squares, each one block shorter on each side, until you only have one block on top. The inside should be hollow.
 Once you have your pyramid, add and subtract blocks to sculpt your volcano into the correct shape.


Beginner builders can also stick to the pyramid shape as well.
Remove the top of the volcano.
Build a platform 3-4 layers underneath the top of the volcano. Make sure there are no holes in it -- this holds your lava.
 You can build ruts or cut out openings in the sides of the mountain to make it flow, or simply let it bubble over and around the top.
 This takes some work, but you can put dispensers on the platform you've made and fill it with arrows and redstone torches.
 In your crater, place a layer of obsidian down for the platform, as it won't explode. Then place an ignition block (redstone switch) down in the corner and fill the platform with a layer of TNT. Top the rest off with 4-5 layers of gravel, then pour lava into the last 1-2 layers, right up to the rim of the volcano. Ignite and enjoy!

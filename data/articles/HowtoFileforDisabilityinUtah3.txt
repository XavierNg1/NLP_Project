 The SSA website will allow you to file for disability online without being required to visit an SSA office.


Visit the "Social Security Disability" website, which is listed within the Sources section of this article.
Click on the "Apply for Disability" button, then complete the section on the right to start the application process.
Click on "Apply for Benefits" after you have completed the "start your application" section to access the SSA online disability paperwork.
 The SSA website will guide you through each step of the online paperwork until you have reached the end of the application process.


Enter your medical evidence and information surrounding your disability into the SSA online application. You may need to refer to the documents you gathered earlier to complete the application in its entirety.
 Although you have submitted your application using the Internet, you will still be required to provide the SSA with documents to support your claim. The SSA will then forward your medical evidence to the Utah DDS team, who will review your disability claim.


Follow the directions on the SSA website regarding the process for sending your documents to an SSA office.

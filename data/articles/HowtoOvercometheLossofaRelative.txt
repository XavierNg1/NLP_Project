 You're going to wish your relative wasn't dead. Death is completely natural, and consider this: would you rather they be here suffering.;
, It might make you sad, but at the same time, it will help you get over the loss. When you look at the pictures, remember that they loved you.


If the relative will be buried, ask for something that's part of them. You could ask for mementos such as their glasses, wallet or license. If you can't have anything their memory will be enough.
If the relative will be cremated, ask for some of their ashes. If receiving some of their ashes is not possible, just keep looking at pictures to remind you of them and how they treated you, and what good times you had.
 Remember to get out there and still have fun with your friends and family.
 Talk to a family member, or close friend, and ask them for help. They will help you feel safe in your own skin.
 If this loved one was extremely close to you, it is going to feel like the end of the world. But you must understand that it isn't. Know that you will get through this.
 You may want to, but you must never forget about this relative. Keep pictures, and look at them once in a while. Keep things that you gave to the person. Give yourself some time everyday to think about your relative. It may hurt at first, but then you'll always remember the good times you had with that relative.

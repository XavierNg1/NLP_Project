 Try reading a passage out loud at your normal speed, and then try reading it faster than your normal speed. This will make any other tempo seem slower. Next, re-read the text with a conscious effort to read it more slowly Then continue slowing down until it seems exaggeratedly slow.With practice, this kind of speed alteration will help you learn how to control the tempo of your voice.
 Read a passage aloud at your normal volume. Then try reading it aloud in a whispered voice. Practice reading things in a whispered tone. The extra effort put into expelling the air out at a softer volume will automatically slow down your monologue.Try to inhale deeply and then expel all of the air while you complete a single phrase. Pause between phrases.
 A lot of people have trouble hearing the problems that occur in their own speeches, especially in the moment during a presentation or speech. Record yourself while you are speaking – preferably during a live presentation, not just a practice session – so you can listen to yourself and critique your mistakes.Play the recording when you are alone and have some time to analyze what you hear. Try practicing the same speech again, but make a conscious effort to alter some of the issues you noticed in the recording.
Think about places in which your speech seemed especially fast, and practice slowing down especially in those moments.
 Ask a trusted friend or colleague to listen to you when you are speaking and to jot down a few notes for you. After the presentation is over, ask the person for any thoughts, especially related to the speed of your speech.Try to take their criticism in a good natured manner. Remember that you asked them to do this for you.

Bruise several sprigs of washed and dried rosemary by rolling them under the palm of your hand on a hard surface, like a cutting board.
Place the bruised rosemary sprigs in a sterilized glass jar that has a tight fitting lid.
Warm olive oil, safflower or sunflower oil in a pan until it is too warm to touch. Donâ€™t let it smoke.
Pour the warm oil over the rosemary in the jar until it is completely covered. No part of the rosemary should be out of the oil. Put the lid on.
Store the jar in the refrigerator for 2 weeks.
Remove the rosemary sprigs and strain the oil if pieces remain.
Store the oil in a closed bottle in the refrigerator.
 You can also add the rosemary to your favorite tea and steep as usual.

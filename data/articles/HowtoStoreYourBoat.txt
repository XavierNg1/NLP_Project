 A boat trailer has the added advantages of allowing you to boat on different bodies of water, to seize the random nice days in winter to fish or cruise and can save fees for winter boat storage.
Be sure to check your vehicle owner's manual for safety rules, tips and complete instructions on boat towing capacity . This will help make sure you're selecting the appropriate boating equipment for the model you're buying.;
, A typical rack storage facility keeps your boat in a covered shed filled with trailer-like cradles.
Make a call to the facility a designated time before you want to go boating and they will use a forklift or other lifting machine to retrieve and launch your boat. When you come back, you tie it up, walk away and they return it to the shed.
 You drive your family and gear to the marina, load the boat, cast off the lines and go. Rates vary from state to state and marina to marina, but typically you'll be charged according to the length of your boat or the length of the slip.
Boat marinas often have showers and bathrooms and offer winter storage and service options. The best marinas offer connections for electricity, wash down water, telephone, Internet and TV at the dock.
Boat marinas can be great fun as well, with slip-holders often getting together for parties, cookouts or just friendly socializing.
 The slip becomes a long-term asset.
This takes the annual guesswork out of the where-will-I-keep-my-boat equation in high-demand areas.

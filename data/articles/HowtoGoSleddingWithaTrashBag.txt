 Measure the depth of the snow as it should be at least 6 inches (15.2Â cm) deep because you will not have the sled's hard bottom to protect you from rocks and bumps.;
, If it's too large the ride might be a little scary. If it is too small then it won't be as fun.
 It is preferred that the trash bag be big enough to fit 2/3 of your body, but as long as you cover " your bottom " it will work.


If you can't find a bag big enough to get above your waist then you will have to get two or more bags. Tear one big hole in the bottom of all but one of the bags. Then slide the bags that are torn up to your chest. Then pull the bag without the hole over your feet.






Make sure that no clothing beneath your waist is showing. The cloth will catch on the snow and slow you down or even send you out of control.
 Sit down at the top of the hill that you intend to slide down. Hopping gently is the best way to get to the edge without tearing the bags. When you are to the edge you will need to sit down with your legs extended straight out in front of you.



When you are in position and ready to go, push your hands against the ground to get some forward motion going. not much force is necessary to get you going.






While flying down the hill, lean from side to side to steer your way around interfering objects.
 Either this or throw yourself to the ground.

 Teeth grinding can be a sign that your child is stressed or anxious about something. Helping your child to relax may be the key to getting your child to stop grinding his/her teeth., As mentioned in the previous step, teeth grinding can be a sign that your child is stressed. Helping your child to relax for bed may reduce how often he/she grinds his/her teeth. Create a routine that involves relaxing activities before bedtime.These activities could include:


Taking a warm bath.
Listening to soothing music.
Reading a book.
Telling your child stories or singing lullabies.
 Dimming the lights and making the room cooler can help your child to sleep more peacefully, and thus stop grinding his/her teeth. To make your child’s bedroom relaxing and peaceful:


Keep the lights dim. Instead of using bright fluorescent bulbs, set your child’s room up with some dim bulbs that you can be turned on at night.
Keep the temperature down. Most people tend to sleep better when the temperature in their bedroom is lower (around 65° F or 18° C).
Make sure your child’s bed is comfortable. If your child is starting to outgrow his/her bed, you may want to consider getting him a larger one that he/she can grow into. Having a comfortable bed can help your child sleep better., Warm temperatures can create good blood flow. If you hold a warm, wet washcloth to your child’s face, you will help his/her jaw muscles to relax by creating good blood flow to the area. This will help your child’s jaw to relax and will make him/her less likely to clench his/her teeth together while he sleeps.


Run the washcloth under warm water. Make sure to test the cloth against your own skin first to make sure that it is not too hot. Hold the cloth over your child's jaw. Once the washcloth has cooled, run it under the water again and switch it to the other side of your child’s jaw.

Multi-tasking is less efficient, due to the need to switch gears for each new task, and then switch back again.
Multi-tasking is more complicated, and thus more prone to stress and errors.
Multi-tasking can be crazy, and in this already chaotic world, we need to rein in the terror and find a little oasis of sanity and calm.;
, The remaining steps demonstrate how to stop multi-tasking and start approaching your tasks in a zen-like manner that will provide a much calmer work method.
 This means having to-do lists related to such things as calls, computer, errands, home, waiting-for, etc., depending on your situation.
 A capture tool, such as a notebook, can be used for instant notes on what needs to be done.
 Make sure to have as few in-boxes as possible, so that all incoming stuff is gathered together in one place. Basically, have one in-box for paper stuff, and one for digital.
 Have open blocks in between for urgent stuff that comes up. You might try one-hour blocks, or half-hour blocks, depending on what works for you. Or try this: 40 minute blocks, with 20 minutes in between them for miscellaneous tasks.
 Don’t do anything else until this is done. Give yourself a short break, and then start on your next Most Important Task. If you can get 2-3 of these done in the morning, the rest of the day is gravy.
 Shut off e-mail, and the internet if possible. Shut off your cell phone. Try not to answer your phone if possible. Focus on that one task, and try to get it done without worrying about other stuff.
 Breathe deeply. Re-focus yourself. Get back to the task at hand. If other things come in while you’re working, put them in the in-box, or take a note of them in your capture system. Get back to the task at hand.
 Add the tasks to your to-do lists and re-figure your schedule if necessary. Process your e-mail and other in-boxes at regular and pre-determined intervals.
 Enjoy life. Go outside, and appreciate nature. Keep yourself sane.

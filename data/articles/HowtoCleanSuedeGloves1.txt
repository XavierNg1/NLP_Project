 Before you begin cleaning your suede gloves, check the care tags. There are a lot of different types of suede and suede finishes, and each type has different care needs. The tags should tell you the best process for cleaning your type of suede.For example, you should not use water on very fine suede, since the water will likely stain it. Other types of suede should only ever be cleaned with a suede eraser or brush and never any type of liquid.;
, The nap in suede is what makes it look smooth, but you need to work it up in order to clean it properly. Run a suede brush or bath towel against the grain of your suede gloves. Start at the wrist of your glove and use short strokes, moving up the length of the glove., Rub your suede eraser back and forth over stains and marks on your gloves. Start by rubbing gently. If you notice that the stains or marks aren't coming up, slowly begin to apply more pressure as you rub the eraser back and forth. The suede eraser should bring up most of the marks and stains on your gloves.If you donâ€™t have a suede eraser, you can use a small pencil eraser for this step.
You might notice that some eraser material comes off on the suede. This is normal, and you should be able to brush it right off of your gloves.

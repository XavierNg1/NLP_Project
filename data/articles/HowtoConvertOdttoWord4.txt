 This method requires OpenOffice, but you can use it to convert hundreds of .odt documents to .doc format with just a few clicks.
 This is a file that runs within OpenOffice, allowing you to batch convert many files at once.


You can download the BatchConv macro from oooconv.free.fr/batchconv/batchconv_en.html. It will be in .odt format.
 A window will appear to guide you through the batch conversion process.
 You can browse for single files and add them individually, or you can add folders containing multiple documents.
 You can also choose to have the converted documents appear in the same location(s) as the originals, or you can have all of the converted files placed in one location.
 This may take a while if you have a lot of files to convert.

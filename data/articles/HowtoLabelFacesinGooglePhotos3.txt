 Start by opening Google Photos on your mobile device or by pointing your web browser to http://photos.google.com.
 You should see the label appear at the top of the search results.
 Now you’ll see that label’s page, containing all photos associated with that face label—including the one(s) that don’t belong there.
 A brief menu will appear.
 This is so you can select multiple photos at once if you wish.
 You can click or tap multiple photos to select more than one.
 Once clicked, the face label will be removed from the photo.

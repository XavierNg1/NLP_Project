 If you have a dry skin type, choose toners that are hydrating and moisturizing. Look for products that have peptides, glycolipids, rose hips seed oil or jojoba oil, dimethicone, and glycolic acid. Avoid products that contain alcohol (SD 40, denatured, ethanol, and isopropyl), sodium or ammonium lauryl sulfate, mineral oil, and pertrolatum., If you have an oily skin type, choose toners that are refreshing and gentle for the skin. Do not punish your oily skin by buying toners saturated with alcohol. These toners will dry out your skin causing your skin to produce even more oil. Use products that contain oil-free ingredients, sodium hyaluronate, sodium PCA, and AHA. Avoid products that contain alcohol (SD 40, denatured, ethanol, and isopropyl), sodium or ammonium lauryl sulfate, mineral oil, and pertrolatum., If you have a combination skin type, you will need to purchase two different kinds of toners: one for the summer months and one for the winter months. For the summer months, use a refreshing toner with oil-free ingredients. For the winter months, use a hydrating toner with ingredients that will moisturize your skin, like rose hips or jojoba oil., If you have a sensitive skin type, pick mild toners that are completely free of alcohol and acids, like salicylic acid or paraben. Use products that contain beta glucans, sea whip, white tea extract, and glycerin, i.e., ingredients that are anti-inflammatory and that have antioxidants. Avoid products that contain synthetic dyes and fragrances, alcohol (SD 40, denatured, ethanol, and isopropyl), and sodium or ammonium lauryl sulfate.

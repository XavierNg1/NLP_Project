 In order to apply tea tree oil (and any essential oil), you must first dilute it. This is especially important with tea tree oil because it is such a potent oil. It is suspected to be toxic, so it should never be even slightly ingested. To dilute it, you will either need a wet cotton ball, a container of water, or what is known as a “carrier oil.”The most effective way to dilute any essential oil is with a carrier oil.
A carrier oil is a pure oil that is not potent and can be safely rubbed onto the skin. Examples include olive oil, coconut oil, almond oil, and other natural oils (including neem oil and castor oil).
 Before dripping out the tea tree oil, you need to set up a space for it to be mixed with a carrier oil, and the carrier oil should be poured out first. You can do this in a small dish or in the palm of your hand.


You only need one or two drops of carrier oil for a single treatment, but it can be useful to mix up an ounce of carrier oil with 15 drops of tea tree oil., Any time that you use tea tree oil to treat a skin condition, you should only use a few drops. If you are using a carrier oil, drop between 1 and 3 drops of tea tree into the oil and mix it together with your finger.
 If you are using water, use a lot, somewhere between half a cup and a whole cup, as water makes essential oils spread. If you are using a wet cotton ball, place about 3 drops onto the cotton.
 Once you have properly diluted the tea tree oil, you can rub it onto the skin condition you are treating. In most cases, you will need to repeat this treatment once or twice a day until the condition has gone away.

 These are best booty building exercise. To make a squat, spread your legs shoulder length apart, back straight and arms straight out. Then, lower yourself to a 90 degree angle and bring yourself back up.


Start with doing 10 per day for one day
Let your legs rest for a day in-between
Then do three sets of 20 squats per day (if you get tired or start to hurt, go back to doing 10 per day, just note it may take a little longer before you gain your booty, but safety first);
, To do a lunge, have on leg bent and on the floor, have the other leg bent and up, your foot on the floor, both legs bent at the knee at a 90 degree angle, jump up, and switch legs quickly.


Start by doing 20 per day
Move up to three sets of 20 per day.
 Stand straight up, then lift one leg back until your butt squeezes into a tight bubble, hold it for three counts, bring it back down and repeat, alternating legs.


Start by doing 15 per leg, per day
Move up to 30 per leg, per day

, Lay on your back with both your legs bent upward. Fold your arms like you are about to do crunches, then sit up and touch your arm to the opposing leg, lay back down and do the same for the other arm.


Start by doing 20 per day
Move up to 50 per day

, Lay on your back with your legs straight and toes pointed. Move both your legs up towards the ceiling. Lower back down and repeat.


Do 10 of these per day, after doing five, take a 30 second break, then do the other five.
 The type of pants you wear make a big difference on your booty. Wearing jeans with eye-catching pockets, light material and certain pocket placement can make all the difference you need.


Wear jeans with small, high pockets. Also, have jeans with embellishments or color can draw more eyes to your booty.
 Don't wear loose thick pants, as they can squish your butt or make your curves disappear.


Don't wear dark-wash jeans. Light-wash is a must.
Try high-waisted pants, the slim your waist, making your butt and hips seem larger.

 PAD can cause your limbs to go numb or it can cause them to be painful. For example, you may have leg pain when you walk or climb stairs.If you are older, don't assume that leg pain is just part of aging. Have your legs checked out by a doctor to make sure that you don't have PAD.
 If you get a cut or an injury on your limbs, it may take more time to heal if you have PAD. This is because of the decreased blood flow due to blockage in the arteries.In really severe cases of PAD, injuries to the limbs can develop into gangrene, which is tissue death.
In the most severe cases, you can even lose a limb if PAD is left untreated.
 Along with pain and sores that just wonâ€™t heal, PAD can have a variety of different symptoms. Some other symptoms you may notice include:Legs feel numb, cold, or weak.
Color changes in your legs.
Slow hair growth or hair loss on your legs.
Slow toenail growth.
Shiny patches of skin on your legs.
Having a weak pulse in your legs.
Erectile dysfunction (men).
 There are some risk factors that could increase your chance of getting PAD. The main risk factors are smoking and diabetes. If you have both of these risk factors, you are more likely to get PAD.Additional risk factors that increase your risk of PAD include age, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and a history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or metabolic syndrome.

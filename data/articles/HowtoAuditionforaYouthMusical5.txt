 For your audition, you'll want to wear the appropriate attire.


Try not to come in costume!Â If you want a certain part, you could subtly hint at that role by wearing your hair a similar way or by wearing a similar color, but do not come in costume because that could make you look desperate and it could make for an embarrassing situation if you don't get that role.
Wear comfortable clothing, especially if you will have to dance.
Wear simple clothing. Try to avoid intricate designs, long text or glitter and sparkles. They will only focus on the designs instead of your performance.
Girls - you probably shouldn't wear a dress/skirt to the audition unless you have tights or leggings underneath.
Make sure you are wearing appropriate footwear. Don't wear heels (unless they're character shoes). They can be very tricky to dance in and they won't give the director an accurate view of your height. If you wish, you can bring jazz shoes or character shoes to your audition.
Example: jeans/leggings, a blank, solid-colored shirt (Any type could work), comfortable, plain shoes.
 You'll do fine. Take deep breaths before the audition to help calm your nerves. You might also want to chew on gum before your audition to reduce stress, as long as you throw it away before you enter the audition room. Make sure to bring water or tea - and a lot. You need to be really hydrated before your audition. Do not, however, drink coffee because it can damage your voice. Avoid milk as well, as it coats your throat which produces a different voice than your usual one.

 Orion is very big and obvious, so it makes a good starting point.
, The bottom-left star in the V should be bright and red. This is Aldebaran. Be careful - if you reach the Pleiades, you've gone too far!, It is also the Hyades cluster. Aldebaran isn't actually part of the cluster - it's closer, in between Earth and the Hyades., Without binoculars, you should be able to see the five main stars in the V, maybe a few more. With binoculars, the whole cluster jumps into view. When I tried it, I counted over 50 stars that I could only see with binoculars., You'll notice that the stars of the Hyades are relatively dim, and blue-white in colour. This is one of the first hints that Aldebaran, a bright, red star, is not a part of the cluster., One of the first things that you should notice through a telescope is that, unlike the Pleiades, the Hyades has little to no nebulosity. This indicates that it is an older cluster, and all of the star-forming material has been used up.

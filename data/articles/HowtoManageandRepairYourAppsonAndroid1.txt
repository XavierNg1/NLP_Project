 To do this, remove the back cover of your phone. Most Android devices have a thin slot at the edge of the back cover where you can insert your thumbnail to pull the back cover off. Others will require you to just slide the cover off.


Remove the battery. Just lift the battery from the bay so that it is disconnected from the device.
Wait for a few seconds. This will perform a soft reset on the device. It does not clear the data from your Android device, and most of the time, solves the problem of crashed apps.
Put the battery and back cover on. Just insert the battery back into its bay, and then snap on the back cover until you hear the clasps inside click together.;
, If you cannot remove the battery of your Android, try long-pressing the Power button. Do this until the device shuts off by itself. Once it does, after a few seconds, it will reboot.
 Hold the Power button until the device is turned on.
 Locate the app that crashed or stalled and run it. It should be running smoothly now. If it still doesnâ€™t run properly, try the next method.

 Once again, this is a spray that you won’t want to overdo or you hair could start looking greasy. Some think that coconut oil can help protect the proteins in your hair from the natural wear and tear it goes through day to day such as being exposed to the sun and wind. , This mask will supposedly bring new energy to your hair, causing it to grow faster and look more radiant. To make the mask, you’ll need to mix ripe avocado, one tablespoon of linen oil, a tablespoon of warm honey, a tablespoon of lime juice, three tablespoons of Aloe Vera gel, and two egg yolks. Massage this concoction into the roots of your hair and along the length of it as well. Wrap a warm towel around your hair for about half an hour, and then shampoo and condition as you normally would. It sounds funky, but some swear by it.
 You can find apple cider vinegar online or at a grocery store, and all you will need to do is mix half a cup of it with one cup of warm water and then put it in a spray bottle. Spray your hair after a shower and let it sit for ten minutes before rinsing it out. There’s a chance you’ll smell a bit like vinegar, but you will see immediate results.

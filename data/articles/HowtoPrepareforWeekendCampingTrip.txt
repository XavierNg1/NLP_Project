 Your menu should include a breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as snacks for each full day of camping. Shop for only those foods you know you can consume in a weekend.


Think about the foods you want to eat that require refrigeration, then compare them against the size of your cooler. RVers with refrigerators will have more space available than tent campers who have ice chests and can only carry the essentials.
Eliminate unnecessarily refrigerated food items. Many refrigerated necessities waste space, such as ketchup and mayonnaise. Instead, use single-serve ketchup and mayonnaise condiment packages you've collected from fast food restaurants. Other substitutions for refrigerated items include using powdered milk, cheese and eggs instead of fresh dairy items.
Include other space-saving alternative food items on your list, such as tortillas flat bread and graham crackers which can take the place of bread.;
, Many national parks, forests and wilderness areas require visitors to preregister for campfire permits and more are requiring hikers to make reservations for hiking on popular trails. Learn what your responsibilities are in advance to ensure rapid access to your weekend camping destination.
, Your camping gear preparations should also include a second set of batteries for flashlights. Alternatively bring a solar powered charger.
 Don't rely solely on a GPS; should your GPS batteries die while you're on the trail, you may get lost without a map. Always carry a paper map as insurance whether you're on a weekend camping trip or a two week vacation.

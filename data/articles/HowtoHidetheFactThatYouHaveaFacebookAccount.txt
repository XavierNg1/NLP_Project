If you know you are only getting a short time to use this until you're caught, alternate back and forth from your two Facebook accounts, and have people write some things on your Facebook associated with your old email.



Use Facebook continuously during this time. Use your Facebook, but use it when they aren't looking and always deactivate after you're done, and block the members of your family who deny your usage of Facebook. Also, block their friends, just in case. You can use this Facebook at libraries, or when they're not home.
 Ask them, and if they feel suspicious, you can log into your old email-Facebook. So then it'll REALLY seem as if you barely touched it. Then when you use it, switch back to your new email Facebook, and deactivate your old one. So you have a permanent Facebook. They won't notice a thing.

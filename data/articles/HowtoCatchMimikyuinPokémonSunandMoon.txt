 There is only one known place where Mimikyu can be found, and that's the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart, the site of Acerola's ghost trial, on Ula'ula Island. Mimikyu has a pretty low encounter and capture rate of 5 percent and 45 percent respectively, so be prepared beforehand, with a lot of patience, and make sure that you have a lot of pokéballs on hand.;
, This step is vital, because you cannot catch any Pokémon in the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart until you have beaten the trial completely.
 As stated above, Mimikyu has a pretty low encounter rate of 5 percent, so be prepared to run into a lot of Haunters and Gengars before you run into one Mimikyu.


There is no grass in the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart, but just walk around and you will get encounters with wild Pokémon as you go.
 Once it is at half, use Pokéballs such as Great Balls or Ultra Balls. If it is nighttime in your game, then use a Dusk Ball, because Dusk Balls are more effective for catching Pokémon when it is nighttime in your game. If you want to get the battle over with, you could also attempt to throw a Quick Ball once the battle first starts.
 Give it a nickname and/or add it to your party, if you wish to.

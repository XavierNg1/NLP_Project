 While there are many different brands available,there are two basic options for an attic fan.Either variation can be completed by DIYers and has the added option of programming the fan to only come on if the attic reaches certain temperatures.


Roof-mounted fans are set into the roof of your house and will require you to cut into the roof during installation. You’ll then need to feel comfortable shingling around the fan area, though the installation process itself is relatively easy.
Wall-mounted fans are meant to fit into a gable wall and for extra ease can be installed in place of an existing gable vent, which means you won’t have to remove any shingles or make significant changes to your attic.;
, If you're not sure about installation, don't hesitate to contact a professional. Otherwise:


Start by removing the shingles of the roof somewhere near the peak where you’re planning to install the fan.
Cut an opening and install the fan over the opening.
Re-shingle around the base of the fan.
Contact an electrician to finish wiring the fan to a thermostat and make sure the electrical work meets code for your house.
 If you're not sure about installation, don't hesitate to contact a professional. Otherwise:


Decide which gable to replace with a fan and make sure the fan you’re buying is approximately the same size or larger.
Use a piece of plywood to mount the fan by selecting a piece of plywood of the right size, cutting an opening in the plywood, centering the fan over the opening and mounting the fan brackets to the plywood. Be sure to center the opening you cut in the plywood for the fan over the opening in the attic wall.
Mount the plywood and fan to the attic wall.
Contact an electrician to finish wiring the fan to a thermostat and make sure the electrical work meets code for your house.

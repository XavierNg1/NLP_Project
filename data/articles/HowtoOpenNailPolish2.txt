 If the cap won't twist off, don't force it open with your hands or pliers. This could cause the cap to snap off the bottle. It would also cause the cap to crack.
 Nail polish bottles are made out of glass. Whacking the cap against something might actually cause it to snap off, along with the neck of the bottle., A slippery cap can make a bottle of polish difficult to open, even if it isn't stuck. If you find that your fingers keep slipping, take a rubber band and wrap it around the cap. Place your fingers over the rubber band, and twist the cap. The rubber band will provide friction and give you a better grip.
 When a cap gets stuck onto a bottle, it's usually because nail polish got onto the neck and dried. You can dissolve it with nail polish thinner. Simply lay the bottle down on its side. Place five to six drops of nail polish thinner into the crack between the cap and the bottle. Turn the bottle upside down to get the thinner into the cap, then turn the bottle right-side-up. The cap should be easier to twist off now.








Avoid using acetone or nail polish remover. If acetone or nail polish remover get into the bottle, you could ruin your nail polish.
 Fill a cup or a small bowl with hot water. Hold the nail polish bottle upside down and dip the cap into the water. Wait three to five minutes, then pull the bottle out. The hot water should have softened the hardened polish up. Try opening the bottle now; the cap should twist off easily.








Try to get just the cap under the water, and not the entire bottle.

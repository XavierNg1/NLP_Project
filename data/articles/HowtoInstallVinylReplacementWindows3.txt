 For Mechanical Windows, do not cut black band until window is installed in opening.
 Add shims where necessary. It is highly recommended that shims be placed at the middle of the frame and at the middle of the top and bottom sashes. Also, install shims behind screw holes to prevent screw tightening from warping frame.
 For Mechanical and Welded series, holes will be located at the top and bottom of both frames sides (oversize windows may also have pre-drilled holes in frame top). For Sliders, Casement windows and oversize windows, remove factory installed screw caps from top and sides.
 Re-install screw caps.
 Drill pilot holes and secure to frame with small screws at lowest part of expander.
, Be careful, installing too much insulation on top and bottom may cause window to bow.

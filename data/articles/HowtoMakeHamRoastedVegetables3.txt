 Turn the oven on to 450 degrees F (230 C). Get out a rimmed baking sheet and tear off a sheet of aluminum foil. Lay the foil on the pan and set it aside while you finish preparing the ham vegetables.If you don't want to use foil, you could spray the sheet with a little cooking spray instead.
 Wash and trim 3 pounds (1.36 kg) of thin asparagus, 1 1/2 pounds (680 g) leeks (cut in half), and 12 scallions. Cut the asparagus diagonally into 1 1/2-inch (3.8-cm) pieces. Cut the white and tender green parts of the leeks and the scallions into 1 1/2-inch (3.8-cm) thick pieces. Place all of the chopped vegetables into a large roasting pan., Take 3/4 pound (340 g) of smoked ham and carefully slice it into strips that are about 2-inches (5-cm) long and 1/4-inch (6-mm) wide. Put the ham in the roasting pan with the spring vegetables., Pour 1/3 cup (80 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil into the roasting pan along with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the fresh lemon juice. Sprinkle salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Stir the ham and vegetables, so they're coated in the oil and lemon juice., Put the roasting pan in the oven and roast the mixture for 20 minutes. Stir the ham and vegetables halfway through the cooking time, to ensure even roasting. The asparagus should be just tender once the ham vegetables have finished roasting.Taste the ham vegetables and add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice if you want it to have a brighter flavor.

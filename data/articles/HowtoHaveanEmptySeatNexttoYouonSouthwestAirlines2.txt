 Planes tend to fill from the front to the back. Many people choose to sit near the front of the plane so they can get off quickly once it lands. The elderly may choose not to navigate the aisle all the way to the back. Choose a seat at the back of the plane. Less people will make it that far.


Once the aisle and window seats fill, the flight attendant will make an announcement to let people know they should take the first available seat. People tend to sit near the front once they hear this announcement.
 Obviously no one chooses to be sandwiched in the dreaded center seat, so your choice is between the window or the aisle. Sit in an aisle seat in a row where there is already someone in the window seat. People don’t like to ask someone to get up and will pass you by to find a less imposing option., If you are traveling with someone, never sit next to them on the plane. One of you should sit in the aisle and the other in the window. This forces anyone entering the plane to choose the center seat when they get to your row, which is less appealing. You and your travel partner are more likely to have the row to yourselves.If the plane does fill up and someone must sit in the center, it is likely that they will gladly trade with one of you for the window or aisle so that you can sit together.
If you aren’t traveling with a companion, you can still employ this tactic by sitting in a row where the window or aisle seat is already occupied. This will keep couples from sitting in the two available seats in the row.

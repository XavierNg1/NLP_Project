 Herobrine is not real, has never been real, and will never be real. Herobrine is a myth or urban legend among Minecraft players, used to scare new or young players. If you believe that Herobrine is real, someone tricked you. If you think you've seen Herobrine, you were mistaken or an admin on your server was playing a trick on you. You cannot get Herobrine in your game without modding the game.


This of course also means that all the urban legends about what Herobrine can do to you in real life aren't true either. He won't come out of the computer and haunt you if you leave it on at night, etc, etc.
 Many of the "signs" of Herobrine are easily faked. Don't take someone at their word that their game is unmodded. Don't get spooked if you see them in your own game either. Admins can change their skins, how their name displays, and do things like teleport to players and destroy vast areas in order to spook you. This is a sort of hazing or bullying and if someone tells you Herobrine is real, they aren't being very nice to you.
 The code of a game is like the game's DNA. Kind of like how you can't have wings because it's not in your DNA, a game can't have content that's not in the code. There's always a trail with code. Nothing can hide from people that know what they're doing. Do you think that if the character was really there, that someone wouldn't have proven it in the code by now? Herobrine can only appear through the use of mods, which introduce new code to the game.
 Notch, the creator of the game, has stated on multiple occasions that Herobrine is not real and will not be real.Since he makes a lot of his money from kids playing and loving the game, do you really think he'd add in something that would scare them away?

 Place a small amount of baking soda onto the bottom of the cup or carafe. Add just enough water until your form a paste. Scrub the stains using an abrasive sponge. Once the stain is removed, wash your mug or carafe as you usually would.You can also use a baking soda scrub as a preventive measure. Use the scrub at regular intervals so the stains do not set in. Depending on how often you use your mugs or carafes, you may scrub weekly, every other week, or once a month.
 Fill the mug or carafe with a 50/50 mixture of hot water and white vinegar. Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes. Pour out the water and then scrub with an abrasive sponge. Rinse the mug or carafe out when you are finished scrubbing.You can either boil the water before you pour it in or use hot tap water.
You may need to apply the mixture more than once for more stubborn stains.
 Mix 4 teaspoons of salt, 1 cup of crushed ice, and 1 tablespoon of water in the carafe. Swirl the carafe around to clean the carafe. The ice makes the salt more effective.Wash the carafe after you scrub with salt so your next pot of coffee does not taste salty.
Your carafe should be room temperature when you do this.
Donâ€™t try this if your carafe is cracked or chipped.

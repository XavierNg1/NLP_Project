 If it's a case of one to two piglets, they might fit snugly and comfortably in the back of a car that has large space (station wagon, van, etc.). If not, obtain a trailer and hitch it onto your car.;
, A large dog cage should be suitable (you might be able to hire additional ones from the local vet or a boarding kennel). Place a tarpaulin down and line with newspapers, then cover with straw or old blankets for comfort on the base of the cage. Note that this cage method is only suitable for short journeys as livestock should not be confined to a small space for any length of time. The cage is a precaution to prevent them flying about if the vehicle stops suddenly, and to contain them as they move around. If you are traveling for a longer distance, you will need to find a wider space to corral them, or stop frequently to remove them and allow them to walk about, feed, and drink, etc.
 This is especially important during warmer weather, as pigs will heat up quickly (and cannot perspire). Block the back windows of the car from sunlight if it's warm, or cover the cage with dampened cotton blankets. Keep windows down to let air flow through at all times.
 Pigs are partial to motion sickness and any food consumed can trigger this off. Speak softly to your piglet to reassure it. It is likely that it will sleep during the journey but there is no harm in talking to it to reassure it now and then.
 Continue talking to it to reassure it and make sure that it has adequate food and water.

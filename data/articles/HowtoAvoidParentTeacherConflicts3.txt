 A disappointing grade or a poor report regarding conduct can take a toll on parents. Get control of your feelings before meeting with a teacher. Coming into a discussion with excessive complaints or accusations will only hurt your child in the long run.Take some time for yourself first. Call a friend. Go for a walk around the block. Wait a few days if necessary to gain some perspective.
Also, it can help to separate yourself from your child’s performance. Many parents have a tendency to take a negative remark about their child personally, which raises the tension in parent-teacher discussions. Remember that your child is a unique person with their own strengths and weaknesses., A conversation with your child’s teacher should be a two-way street with you listening and speaking. Respectfully state your opinion and then allow your child’s teacher to reciprocate. Practice active listening during the interchange to get an understanding of what the teacher is saying.Remove distractions like cell phones during the meeting. Turn to face the teacher. Make occasional eye contact.
Hear the teacher out before responding. Avoid interrupting.
Try to summarize what they said to be sure you got the right message.
If it appears that the teacher is not listening to you, politely ask them to repeat or paraphrase your concerns so that you can make sure you are both on the same page.
 Some parents go into parent-teacher meetings with a biased impression because of how fondly their child discusses the teacher. You have no reason to compete for your child’s affections, or be envious of the teacher. Consider it a gift that your child has found a teacher that matches their needs so well.If you feel like this, sort through your feelings without involving your child. Bad-mouthing the teacher or being overtly jealous can minimize your child’s confiding in you about school.

 Pancreatic cancer usually develops for a long time before causing distressing enough symptoms to cause one to seek medical help. One may be blessed to have severe enough digestive issues (such as a bile duct blockage) to lead to early enough detection to be surgically operable in an early stage, before stage III or IV. Once they start to develop, there are some common early non-specific symptoms that occur. These include:


Fatigue, unexplained tiredness
Pain in the abdomen or middle of the back
Bloating, possibly repeated diarrhea
Nausea, or chronic indigestion (possibly vomiting)
Rapid changes in blood sugar levels
Diabetes or sudden onset of diabetes
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Blood clots in later stages
If there is jaundice with bile insufficiency because of a duct blockage:

Yellowing skin and/or of the whites of your eyes
Orange or brownish urine
Light colored stool, such as chalky-gray or white (brown stool is normal)
Smelly, greasy, floating stool



, There are certain factors that put you more at risk for pancreatic cancer than others. These risk factors include: The risk factors for pancreatic cancer include:


Being over 50, most are over 65
Smoking
Your ethnic background, because African-Americans are at a higher risk
Past history of chronic pancreatitis or chronic inflammation of the pancreas
Family history of this cancer, especially two or more close relatives, as well as breast, ovarian, or prostate cancer in the family
Obesity, poor diet choices
Diabetic persons who develop diabetes over age 50 have eight times the usual risk of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma within three years, after which the relative risk declines.Excessive consumption of red or processed meat
History of heavy alcohol use or alcoholism
Environmental or workplace exposure to certain pesticides, dyes, and chemicals

, If you notice any symptoms of pancreatic cancer, you should see your doctor. Many of these symptoms may be a sign of other health problems as well, so talk to your doctor about what else your symptoms mean. You should also see your doctor if you are at a high risk of pancreatic cancer due to the risk factors or family history to make sure you are doing well.


Any preventative methods will not ensure that you won't get pancreatic cancer. They will just help you lower your chances.

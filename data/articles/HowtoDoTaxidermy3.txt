 If you've made an accurate form, stuffing your hide should be as easy as dressing a doll. Fix your preserved skin onto the form, being careful to smooth out any unnatural looking lumps or irregularities. You'll want to fix any structural problems now before you sew it up.


Keep some twine on hand to stuff into spots that need some adjustment. Cut small bits of string or newspaper to fill out a muscle striation or other body part.
 Using an appropriate color of thread, stitch together the seam that you originally cut with as tight and invisible a stitch as possible. Adorn your taxidermy with false eyes and original teeth by gluing them in place.
 Use your imagination. If you're displaying a pet, keep them immortalized in a peaceful position, possibly curled up in a nap. Or, if you're celebrating a successful hunt, bare the animal's fierce-looking teeth. More complicated mounts are available commercially, but make up your own. Arrange a tableau of branches or rocks on your wall to position your taxidermy among.
 After the work of preserving your animal, make sure you don't let that work go to waste by ignoring it. Keep your mounts away from sunlight, in a climate controlled area of your home. Dampness can result in mildew, while excessive dryness can cause hides to crack or split. If the form settles in an unnatural way, consider splitting it open and resewing. Dust them periodically to keep them clean and realistic looking.

 Using any web browser on your computer, go to the official Need for Speed World website.
 This will take you to the NFSW sign-up form where you can fill in your personal details.
, Launch the game from the Start menu (Start button >> All Programs >> EA Games >> Need for Speed World) or the desktop, if you have it there.


Log in using the information you created during the registration, and you will be taken to the Select a Driver page.
 Click “Create a Driver” and enter the name you would like to use for your driver in the “Enter a Driver Name” field.


On the Select a Driver Picture pane of the same screen, choose a picture for your Driver from the ones provided.
 Click “Next” at the bottom of the page when you’re done. This will create your Driver and take you to the SafeHouse screen.


At the very top of the SafeHouse screen, you will see that you have been granted a 200,000 SpeedBoost balance. This SpeedBoost can be used to purchase a new car that you can start life with in NFS World.

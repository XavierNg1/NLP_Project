 Create wooden planks by placing wood in your crafting menu and crafting the planks.


If you do not have a crafting bench, use 4 planks, placed in a square, to create a crafting bench.;
, This will create one wooden door. Note that you can change the appearance of the wooden door based on which wood you use. You could therefore have an oak door, spruce door, birch door, or a jungle wood door.


Also note that any door types other than oak and iron only exist from 1.8 and onwards.

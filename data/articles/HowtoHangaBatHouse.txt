 You may mount a bat house on a pole or on the side of a building.


Select a location that faces south or east. Bats like a warm climate, so when hanging a bat house, it's best to provide the house with plenty of sunlight.
Choose a spot away from security and porch lights. You don't want your bat house installation to be affected by artificial lights.
Pick a spot near the edge of a forest or tree grove because bats live in forested areas. To ensure the safety of your bat house, don't hang the house within 20 feet (6.096 m) to 25 feet (7.062 m) of a tree branch. Bats are prey to larger birds that perch in trees.
Select an area near water, if possible. Bats live near water, and hanging bat houses 1/4 mile (402.34 m) from water will make it easier for bats to find the house.;
, Bats return from warmer climates during the spring, and if you mount a bat house before they return, they are more likely to use it during the summer. If you are evicting bats from a building, set up the bat house 2 to 6 weeks before you move them out.



Measure the width of your bat house with a measuring tape. Bat house installation entails building rails to mount the house.
Add 6 inches to the width, and cut 2 rails out of 1 inch (2.54 cm) by 2 inch (5.08 cm) wood to that length with a saw.
Drill holes in the rails and matching holes in the bat house with a drill. You will mount a bat house on the frame before you hang it.
Spread glue or caulk between the bat house and the rails.
Use a screwdriver and 1.5 inch (3.81 cm) screws to attach the bat house to the rails.
 When you mount a bat house, be sure to use a long ladder.

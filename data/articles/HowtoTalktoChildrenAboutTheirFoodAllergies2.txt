 Using role-playing to prepare for situations can make the preparation a little more fun for you and your child. Prepare for common situations like ordering out in a restaurant or telling a friend that your child cannot have a certain type of food when it is offered to him.
, This is especially helpful as the child gets older. Work with your child to create a plan for a school event or a friendâ€™s party by understanding what makes him feel comfortable and uncomfortable in certain situations. By including him in the process, he will be more likely to follow the plan that is laid out.

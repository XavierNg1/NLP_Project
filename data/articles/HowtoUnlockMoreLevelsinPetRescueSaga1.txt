 Once you’ve reached the gate for the next locked level, you will need three tickets to unlock the next levels. The easiest and simplest way to get the tickets is by requesting them from your Facebook friends.


On the “Unlock more levels!” window, click or tap the “Ask friends” button. You have to be connected to your Facebook account from Pet Rescue Saga for this to work. You will be presented with your list of friends under the “Ask for help” window. Select or tap the friends you’d like to request tickets from then click or tap the “Send” button once done to send the requests.
You don’t have to limit your requests to just three friends; you can send to as many as you want. This will likely get you the needed tickets faster.;
, After you’ve sent your requests, you can view how many tickets you’ve received and from whom by tapping the gate on the map. It usually has a wiggling warning sign over it as a mark.


Be patient and wait. You can’t force others to help you since you’re asking for a favor.
 Once all the tickets have been received, tap the “Unlock” button and you will be brought to the next level. Keep on playing.

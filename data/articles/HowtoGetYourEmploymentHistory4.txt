 It's often said that once you put something on the internet, it's impossible to remove it completely. You may be able to use this to your advantage.


Use a search engine to look for your full name and any other versions of your name that you've used in the past. You can narrow this search by including other information such as the name of the city or state where you lived at the time.
Look not only for actual documents that would display your work history, but also for words or accounts that might jog your memory. For example, if you find an old social media account, you may read a post you made talking about a coworker that helps you remember where you were working at the time.
 If you maintain an archive of old emails, or if you have an old email address that you can still access, search for work-related keywords to find mention of previous employers.
 If your computer or your phone archives your contacts, scroll through the list and see if it includes people from old jobs.


You may have added the phone number of your workplace, or of a manager or coworker, and then failed to delete it when you moved on to another employer.
 Although you may not remember that summer job you had when you were 16 years old, for example, your mother might. Friends and family can also help remind you of other details that might trigger a recollection.

A good way to remove gunk and grime thoroughly is to use a toothbrush to lightly scrub your razor when you are finished shaving. Then, rinse away the gunk under running water., When your razor is wet, the metal is vulnerable to corrosion and rust. This will cause your razor to dull more quickly. Thoroughly dry your razor when you are done shaving to prevent this.


Many approaches can work for drying your razor. For example, you might use a blow dryer or blot your blades with a towel.

Rushing while blotting your blades with a towel might cause you to accidentally run your fingers along the sharp part of the blade, which could cut you., You might consider using a mineral oil or a small amount of cooking oil on your blade after drying it. This will coat the outer surface of the blade, making it less susceptible to moisture in the air, airborne dirt, and other environmental factors that can lead to a dull razor.


Some companies offer special formulated oils designed to prolong the life of your blade. Search for these in the shaving section of your local pharmacy, or online through a shaving vendor.

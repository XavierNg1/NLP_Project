 You will see a bus symbol. The 747 picks people up towards the end of the pick up area, on the roadway that passes alongside the doors (not the further roadway, where many other buses stop). You will see a sign, and there will probably be a line of people waiting.;
, This bus does not accept bills, but it does accept coins. If you don't have coins, there is a machine that is just inside the door which will accept bills. The cost is $10 (Canadian). When you use the machine, you will get a card to use when you board the bus.
 Insert the coins into the coin slot or scan the card you got from the machine. Keep the card; it's good on the bus and metro network for the next 24 hours.
 They are toward the front of the bus, near the driver. Look at the map and determine which stop is closest to your destination. You can also find the route map online before your trip (http://stm.info/English/bus/planibus/747.pdf).
 This will tell the driver you need to get off.

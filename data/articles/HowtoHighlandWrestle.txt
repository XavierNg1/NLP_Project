The first person wraps their arms around the second person with their right armÂ under the second person's left arm and their left arm over the second person right arm.
The first person's chin should rest on the second person's left shoulder.;
, The right palm should be facing in.,, Once both people have a good hold, the referee shouts "Hold!" and the wrestlers must commence trying to force the other to fall or break their hold.,

If you're smaller then your opponent, then try to make him fall by wrapping your legs around his.
If you are larger than your opponent, then just use brute strength.


It is considered a fall if any part of your body touches the ground other than the bottoms of your feet.
A hold is broken when your fingers come apart.
If you both fall, the person on the bottom gets a point.
 They are:

No kicking with the toe, only with the side of the foot.
No head butting.
No hitting.
No hitting with the shoulders, knees or elbows.

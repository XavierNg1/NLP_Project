 Without letting the ends of the scarf go, hang the scarf around the front of your neck so that the ends would hang down over your back if released. Cross the ends behind your neck and bring them back around to the front.


The ends of the scarf should hang straight down in front of your chest when finished.
One end should be longer than the other. The short end should hang around your chest while the long end should reach down to your waist.
Use a long rectangular scarf for this style. A scarf with fringed ends looks best, but you can also go with one that has rounded edges.
This tying method is very warm and highly suitable for cold weather.
 Cross the longer end over the shorter end before threading it through the resulting loop. Pull the long end back over the front of the loop to tighten it.


Essentially, this move is the same sort of tie you would use when tying your shoelaces.
When you cross the longer end over the shorter end, a loop will be created around your neck. This is the loop you will need to pull the longer end through.
Pull the ends so that the knot is tightened flat against your neck.
 Arrange the longer end so that it lays flat over the front of the shorter end.


The longer end should already be positioned over the short end. If not, readjust the knot so that the longer end naturally lays in front.
 If the knot is too tight or too loose against your neck, readjust the ends of the scarf to fix the problem.


Button or zipper your jacket over the ends of the scarf. Do not let the scarf hang outside of your overcoat.
If wearing a long, fringed scarf, the fringe may peek out from underneath the jacket. This is acceptable, but it is an optional style choice that you can choose to keep or reject.

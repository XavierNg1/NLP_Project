 Understand if your rate compounds annually only (meaning that interest is calculated and accumulates only once per year) vs monthly (or over a different period). If your interest rate compounds at a frequency other than annually, use annualizing a non-compounding interest rate to calculate your annualized rate. Otherwise, use the method for annualizing non-compounding interest rates., This is the amount of interest charged or paid each period. For example a monthly interest rate of 1 percent would be a 1 percent period interest rate. If you assume that the interest rate will remain the same for the rest of the year, you can annualize this percentage.

Note that in order to calculate the annualized percentage, this number will have to be converted to decimal form. You can do this by dividing the stated period interest rate by 100. 

For example, a 1 percent period rate would be expressed as 0.01 (1/100)., This represents the number of times the periodic percentage rate will be compounded during the year. For example, a periodic percentage yield quoted as once per month will be compounded 12 times during 1 year., The annualized percentage yield is calculated with the formula((1+r)n)−1{\displaystyle ((1+r)^{n})-1}. In the formula, r represents the period rate and n represents the number of periods.

For example, a periodic yield of 1 percent compounded monthly would be calculated as ((1+0.01)12)−1{\displaystyle ((1+0.01)^{12})-1}., Calculate each part of the equation using the proper order of operations. Start by adding the figures within parentheses.

After adding these numbers (1 + 0.01), your equation should look like this:((1.01)12)−1{\displaystyle ((1.01)^{12})-1}

Solve the exponent. This is done by entering the lower number (1.01 in this case), pressing the exponent button (which is usually xy{\displaystyle x^{y}}), entering the higher number (12) and pressing enter. The equation should now be: (1.127)−1{\displaystyle (1.127)-1}

The result, 1.127, has been rounded to make calculation simpler. Keeping more decimal places will make your calculation more accurate. 



Subtract the one. This gives: 0.127{\displaystyle 0.127}. Represented as a percentage, by multiplying by 100, this is 12.7 percent. 

So, an interest rate of 1 percent compounded monthly gives an annual percentage rate of 12.7 percent.

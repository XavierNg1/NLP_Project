 Maybe if you just suddenly started smelling smoke frequently, it is someone who just moved here. Ask around to find out who it is.
 Here is a perfect example of one, modify it a little to fit whatever the situation is;


Dear ________, I've been smelling smoke in my garage lately, and I may not be the only one on this street smelling your smoke. I respect your right to smoke, and understand why you don't smoke inside your house. Smoking outside shifts the problem elsewhere, from your kids and spouse to your neighbors and the public. I want my right as a member of the non-smoking majority respected just as much as you want your rights as a smoker respected. Please find somewhere to smoke where it affects no unwilling people.
 Remember; be sure to go over all the points mentioned in the letter. Always use good manners, even if it is clear that you could have telling points and win in an argument; smokers will do anything to justify smoking and defend it simply because of their chemical addiction.

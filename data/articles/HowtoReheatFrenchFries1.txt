, Tin foil is also known as aluminium foil. Covering your baking sheet with tin foil will ensure that your fries don’t stick to the sheet when they are reheating and it makes cleanup much easier.
 Make sure that you spread the fries so that they are one layer deep with none overlapping. If the fries overlap while reheating, they will fuse together.You can add a bit of extra salt or some other seasonings to your fries to enhance their flavor.



If you have a toaster oven that can reach 450°F (232°C), feel free to use that instead. Just make sure you use the baking sheet or the pan that is supposed to go in the toaster oven.
 Open the oven and jostle the fries around from time to time. Take the fries out when they are golden brown, heated, and crispy.,

Each seed variety requires specific conditions needed for germination, including proper temperature, moisture levels and sunlight.
Too much or too little of any of these necessary elements will result in the delicate seed or seedling failing to grow.



Separated by temperature variation, areas are divided into International or United States Department of Agriculture Hardiness Zones.
Each zone helps gardeners understand their particular climate, and teaches gardeners how to plant vegetable seeds outdoors during the proper time of year for the best results. Zones determine lowest and highest temperatures, and the expected annual rainfall, which are vital to seed germination.



The depth each seed needs to be placed in the ground generally depends on its size, with larger seeds needing to be placed deeper in the soil.
The proximity of each seed also usually depends on size, with larger seeds requiring more space between each one.
 Now is also a good time to add a small amount of fertilizer mixed with the water to give the seeds extra nourishment.

 Consider that racist stereotypes are largely rooted in ignorance. Confront ignorance with truth. Try to keep an open mind and step outside of your shell. Learn as much as you can about other races, languages, and cultures. Knowledge is power.


Read the news, and not just from a single source. Absorb as many perspectives as possible. Carefully consider the bias behind each source.
Don't hold it in. Share what you learn with your friends, family, and larger community. Learn to teach and teach to learn.;
, Accept others, even if they don't accept you. You do not need to become "colorblind" – you can appreciate other races and cultures for the things that make them unique. Embrace uniqueness wherever you encounter it.
 The ubiquity of the Internet makes it easier than ever to reach, teach, and influence people beyond your normal sphere of interaction. Share articles, videos, and stories on social media; find a platform to blog or otherwise broadcast your perspective; and generally consider how your online presence feeds or fights the dialogue of racial imbalance. Look for ways to speak out in your school, neighborhood, or workplace. Encourage your family, friends, and broader community to respect and accept individuals from different backgrounds.


Be careful about what and how you post on the Internet. Your social media presence may be much more public than you realize. Consider the dangers of provoking the ire of anonymous strangers.
 Listen to people from all races and cultures. Find the things that you have in common, and seek to understand what divides you. Strive to curate a peaceful and respectful conversation about racism – a conversation that includes and empowers everyone.Understand that we must work in collaboration to create a safe and inclusive society.

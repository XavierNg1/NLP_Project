 Let's say you're working with the following problem: "Becky is selling tickets to her school's talent show for 5 dollars each. The amount of money she collects is a function of how many tickets she sells. What is the range of the function?"

, In this case, M represents the amount of money she collects, and t represents the amount of tickets she sells. However, since each ticket will cost 5 dollars, you'll have to multiply the amount of tickets sold by 5 to find the amount of money. Therefore, the function can be written as M(t) = 5t.


For example, if she sells 2 tickets, you'll have to multiply 2 by 5 to get 10, the amount of dollars she'll get.
 To determine the range, you must first find the domain. The domain is all of the possible values of t that work in the equation. In this case, Becky can sell 0 or more tickets - she can't sell negative tickets. Since we don't know the number of seats in her school auditorium, we can assume that she can theoretically sell an infinite number of tickets. And she can only sell whole tickets; she can't sell 1/2 of a ticket, for example. Therefore, the domain of the function is t = any non-negative integer.
 The range is the possible amount of money that Becky can make from her sale. You have to work with the domain to find the range. If you know that the domain is any non-negative integer and that the formula is M(t) = 5t, then you know that you can plug any non-negative integer into this function to get the output, or the range. For example, if she sells 5 tickets, then M(5) = 5 x 5, or 25 dollars. If she sells 100, then M(100) = 5 x 100, or 500 dollars. Therefore, the range of the function is any non-negative integer that is a multiple of five.


That means that any non-negative integer that is a multiple of five is a possible output for the input of the function.

 Read the official DSM-V criteria,but also criteria written by autistic people,and articles that describe the criteria. Also consider consulting autistic bloggers, who can provide a picture of autism in daily life.


It helps to write down a general list so you remember.
You will be asked questions about things that relate to these criteria. Preparing the list will help you know what to expect.;
, The psychologist may ask you to tell some brief stories to "prove" that the criteria apply to you. This way, you will have examples on hand, rather than becoming flustered and confused by a sudden question.


Example story (for stereotypy): "I recently saw a video of myself on my eighteenth birthday, when people surprised me with a cake. Everyone else was standing still, while I was rocking and swaying. I stuck out like a sore thumb. Then I learned about stimming and realized maybe I wasn't strange after all."

, While you won't be able to predict every question, it may help to prepare some scripted responses if you have a hard time speaking spontaneously.


Since the psychologist is an autism expert, she should be patient with your special needs. It's not uncommon for autistic people to have trouble responding to questions, and your psychologist will understand that.
It is not disingenuous to write down your responses—in fact, it is even more honest, because the responses come from a time when you can collect your thoughts at your leisure.
If you have severe speaking trouble, you can bring the prewritten responses to the assessment with you.
 While not official, these will help you identify autistic traits and gauge approximately where you are in the spectrum. These include the RAADS-R, the AQ, the Short Autism Screening, and other tests.
 Indulge in your special interests, listen to good music, and spend some time with a close friend or a pet. This will help you feel relaxed before the conversation.

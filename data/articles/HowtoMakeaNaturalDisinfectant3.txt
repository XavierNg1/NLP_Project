 Combine one part water and one part rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and shake to mix up the two ingredients. Rubbing alcohol is a highly effective disinfectant and is often used on medical devices., Pour 10-30 drops of thyme essential oil or another essential oil of your choice into an 8- ounce (236.58 ml) glass spray bottle. Add 1 ounce (29.57 ml) of rubbing alcohol, then fill the spray bottle up with water until it reaches the top. Shake to mix the ingredients and store in a cupboard or pantry., Vinegar and hydrogen peroxide work well to disinfect, but they should not be combined in a single container as they make a peracetic acid which can be hazardous. Instead, add undiluted white vinegar to one spray bottle and 3% hydrogen peroxide to another.To use, clean a surface, then spray with one mixture, let it sit for about 5 minutes, then wipe with a clean cloth and spray with the other. Let it sit for 5 minutes and then wipe with another clean cloth.
It does not matter if you start with the vinegar or with the rubbing alcohol.

 Some examples of styles are indie, goth, sporty, preppy, or natural. Your style is not necessarily the style you want to be; it is the style that you portray. Here is a mini-guide to figure out your style:

Goth/Emo: Clothing in shades of black/gray, dark make-up, fishnets, chunky bracelets and necklaces.



 


Sporty: Tracksuits, sweatsuits, headbands, baseball caps, sneakers, light or no make-up.

Preppy: Plaid, skirts, natural make-up, natural hair.

If you feel that you do not fit into any of these categories, ask your friends and family members for their opinion.
 Use celebrities like Avril Lavigne, Adele, Ke$ha, and Pink as your "style role models." If you don't absolutely love it in the store, you won't wear it when you get home- only get it if you're going to wear it!, It's yours! Be proud! Don't let anyone suppress it.

 To administer liquid medication to your rabbit, you are going to need to a needleless syringe. One of these can be obtained at your veterinarian’s office, or at most pharmacies.If you do not have a needleless syringe, a plastic dropper can be used as well.
 Place the tip of the syringe into the liquid medication and pull back the plunger until the correct dosage is in the tube. (Follow dosage instructions on medication packaging.) Try to ensure that there are no air bubbles.If you get air bubbles in the syringe, simply eject the liquid and start over.
Be sure that the syringe opening is totally submerged in the liquid. (This will help prevent bubbles.)

, Sit down with your rabbit on your lap. Gently hold your rabbit still under your non-dominant arm, like you would a football. Do this gently and try to keep your rabbit calm.Be aware that your rabbit might squirm, so hold on tight.
 Wiggle the syringe into the rabbit’s mouth. It should be inserted right through the large gap between the incisors and cheek teeth, and directed toward the back corner of the mouth., Once you have inserted the syringe, press down on the plunger to slowly dispense the liquid medication. Once again, be sure to aim toward the back corner of the mouth, and not down the throat.It is very important you don't do this too forcefully. Give the rabbit a chance to swallow and avoid flooding the mouth with liquid. There is a risk if liquids are squirted in too quickly that the rabbit will inhale the medicine, which can cause pneumonia.
 Once your rabbit has taken the medicine, give them some gentle pats and words of praise. You may even want to play with them a bit, or offer a favorite treat.

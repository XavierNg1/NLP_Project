 Grade ranges vary among professors and teachers. If your professor or teacher provided a syllabus at the beginning of the year, it may list the grade range. Your school handbook may have this information as well. If you cannot find a range on any of your materials, ask your professor or teacher.
 Although there are variations, this is the most common grading range for schools and universities in the USA. A "B" or higher is typically considered a "good" grade. A D is the lowest passing grade, but it may not fulfill requirements for further courses or college applications.An "A" is 90% to 100%. A grade of 94% or higher would be considered an “A.” A grade of 90%-93% would be considered an “A-.”

A "B" is 80% to 89%. A grade of 87% or higher would be considered a “B+.” A grade of 83%-86% would be considered a “B.” A grade of 80%-82% would be considered a “B-.”

A "C" is 70% to 79%. A grade of 77% or higher would be considered a “C+.” A grade of 73%-76% would be considered a “C.” A grade of 70%-72% would be considered a “C-.”

A "D" is 60% to 69%. A grade of 67% or higher would be considered a “D+.” A grade of 63%-66% would be considered a “D.” A grade of 60%-62% would be considered a “D-.”

An "F" is 59% and below. An “F” is a failing grade, so professors and teachers do not usually assign + or – values to “F” grades., The United Kingdom uses several grading scales in primary and secondary school, for tests such as the GCSE and A-levels. These have their own classification terms, but the percentages roughly correspond to the following. This system is also used for undergraduate work in the UK and in India.


70% to 100% is the highest grade, a mark of Distinction.
60% to 69% earns a Merit.
50% to 59% is Pass.
Some schools Fail at 49% or below, while others fail at 39% or below.

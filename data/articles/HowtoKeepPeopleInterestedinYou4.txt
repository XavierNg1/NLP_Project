 If you're into art, make art for others and show it off. If you play an instrument, join the orchestra, band, or form your own musical group. Take your unique talents and show the world what you can do with them!

, People are naturally attracted to those who are funny, and this is the #1 way to make "unspoken friends" - where you're obviously friends, but it just happened one day with no real conversation needed. Join in or add on to jokes, crack one when appropriate, and laugh things off.


Make sure you can take things seriously. Laughing or being funny too much can ruin relationships and bring your social status down a few rungs on the ladder. If somebody is going through a hard time, it may be okay to tell a joke to cheer him or her up, but not a joke about the situation.
 Like an Indie artist, nobody has heard of? Go ahead and listen to it with some friends, and enjoy it yourself. Obsessed with a certain snack or drink? Let others try! Wear bright colors while the rest of your environment is a bit more monotone? Heck, if it looks good, why wouldn't you?


Don't constant flaunt these different features. There's a huge difference between sharing your interests and forcing something down others' throats. Like what you like, but don't show them around like they're any more important than the mainstream.
 Once again, be vague in them, but go on and share them. Something funny at a birthday party, a strange experience on New Year's, dealing with an ex on Valentine's Day, or perhaps an odd gift for the holidays can all be shared.

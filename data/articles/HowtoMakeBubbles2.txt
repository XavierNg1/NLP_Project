 If you buy bubble solution from the store, it's likely to come with a small plastic wand. Bubble wands are usually a few inches in length, with a handle on one side and a plastic circle with a hole on the other. The circle is dipped into bubble solution, and you blow through the hole to make bubbles.









You can also buy a giant bubble-blowing kit. These come with a big wand with a net that is capable of making very large bubbles.
You may also be able to find wands of different shapes and sizes, and other decorative wands, in toy stores and dollar stores.
 Bubble wands don't have to be made out of plastic. Most any material with a hole in it can be used to blow bubbles. Try using the following materials to make a wand:









Bend the top of a pipe cleaner into a circle shape, then bend the tip of the circle around the shaft of the pipe cleaner to create a wand shape. Experiment with different shapes for the blower part - make a heart, star, or square instead of a circle.
Use a wire dipper used for dying eggs.

Bend a straw to make a hole, then use tape to keep the hole in place.
Use the holes in a slotted spoon or other kitchen utensil.
For the sake of experimentation, try using an onion ring or a thick slice of an apple that has been cored.
 If you want to blow huge bubbles, your wand needs netting over the hole to stabilize the bubbles as they are created. Take the following steps to make your own big bubble wand:









Unbend a coat hanger to make it into one straight wire.
Bend one end of the wire into a circle shape.
Fasten the tip of the circle to the straight part of the wire with some pliers.
Wrap wire netting (chicken wire, for example) around the circle and use the pliers to secure it in place.

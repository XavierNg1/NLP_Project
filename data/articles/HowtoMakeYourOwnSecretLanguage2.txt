 Choose unique words that you don't typically use in an average day. These can be big words, names of celebrities or athletes, names of sports or hobbies, etc. You will use these words to replace names, locations, activities, etc. in your new language. Using this technique is a much faster and simpler way to create your own language.


For example, if you and your friends are basketball fans, create a list of well-known players, and use their names as substitutes for certain people.
If you want to keep things simple, focus on only replacing words that are verbs or emotions. This can change the entire meaning to a sentence without changing every word.
 Replace the meanings of words that already exist to give them your new meanings. Get together with your friends and have a brainstorming session. Write down the words of your language and their new meanings so that nobody forgets.


Try to use words that have very different meanings so that your language isn't hard to figure out. For example, use the word taco for hate. So if your sentence was originally "I hate math", your new sentence is "I taco math."

, This will help each of your friends to decipher it quickly before the words are learned. Store it on your phones or computers so that you can access the diary quickly.


This dictionary should be akin to an actual dictionary. It should list the words in your made up language, and define what they actually mean in your native language.
This dictionary doesn't have to include every single word in a real dictionary, as many of the words will mean the same thing. It should include all of the words that you have changed the meaning of.

 Mac OS X supports ISO files natively without the need for any third-party software. Most ISO files will mount by simply double-clicking them. The disc image will then appear on your desktop as if you had inserted a disc.
 If your ISO file does not mount when you double click it, you can use the Disk Utility program. The Disk Utility can be found in the Applications/Utilities/ directory.


Click File, then Open Disk Image… Navigate to your image file, and select Open.
The ISO file will now appear on your desktop as if you had inserted a disc.
This method works for other disc image filetypes, such as DMG and IMG.
 If you are more comfortable working with the command line, you can mount a disc image through the Terminal.


Type “hdiutil mount <sample>.iso” into the terminal and press Enter.
After processing the file, your ISO image will appear mounted on your desktop.
This method also works for other disc image filetypes, such as DMG and IMG.

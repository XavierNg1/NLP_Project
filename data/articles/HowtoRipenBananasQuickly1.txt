 By placing the bananas in a brown paper bag with another fruit, you will maximize the amount of ethylene gas released. Ethylene gas is the substance fruit produces as it ripens. This will help to substantially speed up the ripening process, giving you smooth, creamy bananas.

,, Make sure the tomato is not overripe so it doesn't burst or mold in the paper bag. If you don't have an apple or tomato, a pear will also do the trick.
 Roll down or fold the top of the paper bag to seal in the ethylene gas produced by the fruit.
 Higher temperatures cause fruits to release more ethylene gas, which will speed up the ripening process even further.
 Leave the bananas and other fruit in the paper bag overnight. Check the bananas in the morning to see if they have reached the desired level of ripeness. If not, roll the bag up again and check the bananas every 12 hours until they become ripe enough.









You should be able to ripen green bananas using the paper bag method to the point where they have yellow skins, or yellow skins speckled with brown spots, within 24 hours.

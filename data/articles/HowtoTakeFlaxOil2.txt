 There are two different varieties of flaxseeds: brown and golden. The price is often significantly different, but the amount of nutrients is about the same. Choose the seed type that is within your price range and that works best for how you plan to use them.
 If you decide to use whole flaxseeds, but you also want to grind them to add to various foods, then you can use a coffee grinder to grind them up. Make sure that you set aside a coffee grinder that is only for grinding flaxseeds. Otherwise, your flaxseeds may end up getting mixed with coffee grounds.Some nutritionists recommend ground over whole flaxseeds because it is easier for your body to digest and use the nutrients in ground flaxseed.Whole flaxseeds tend to be excreted from the body still in tact, thus limiting their benefit.
 You can add up to one tablespoon a day of whole flaxseed your food. Add flaxseeds to cereals, soups, stews, sauces, and salad dressings. You can take the tablespoon all at once (in a morning cereal, for example) or divide it up throughout the day.
 You can also grind flaxseeds and use the ground flaxseed as toppings for cereals, soups, salads, vegetables and stews. Use ½ to one tablespoon of ground flaxseed every day. You can either use it all at once at one meal or divide it up between meals.You can also use the freshly ground flaxseeds as a flour to make muffins, pancakes and breads. Substitute the ground flaxseeds for regular flour— if the recipe calls for one cup of flour, add ½ cup of flour and ½ cup of ground flaxseed.

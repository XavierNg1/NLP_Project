 If you like a bit of a preppy surfer look, try shopping at Hollister. Don't just wear brands though, mix up your look with clothes from other stores.;
,, You will need a cleanser/face wash, toner (optional), a face scrub, a face masque or two and of course a moisturiser. Try to maintain a clean, healthy face.
 For example, typical everyday make-up would be: Foundation/Concealer (only if you need it), Brow pencil/shadow (if you don't have luscious full eyebrows), Mascara - you may need waterproof for when you're surfing, a bit of blush, bronzer and lip balm - preferably with SPF. And remember, you don't need to wear make-up everyday.
 Get a shampoo and conditioner that works for your hair and use treatments whenever you can. Buy salt spray to help with your surfer waves, or just make your own!

,, You don't want to be a poser. Beginner? Get surfing lessons.
, Try to drink 2 liters (0.5 US gal) of water everyday, eat lots of fresh fruit and oily fish (lots of omega-3 fatty acids, which are very good for you, come from oily fish, seeds and some nuts), plus seeds, nuts, and try to eat little sweet things.
 You will obviously get fit from surfing, so there isn't too much to worry about. Why not try pilates, yoga and meditation classes? Dancing, or any sport to be honest, is fine. You might like skateboarding, too.
 Have the hippie spirit, and always give things a go. You never know what you could be missing out on!

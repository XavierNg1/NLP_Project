 Relaxation exercises are a great way to reduce stress and anxiety, which are common problems for people with pain disorder.Offer to practice some relaxation techniques with your loved one and encourage him or her to use these techniques to combat stress and anxiety.


This can include meditation, yoga, breathing exercises, or muscle relaxation techniques.
 Getting regular physical activity may also help with your loved one’s symptoms.For example, your loved one may benefit from taking a 30 minute walk or bike ride each day, or from participating in a dance class a few times per week. Help your loved one to stay active by inviting him or her to do activities with you, such as:


Asking your loved one to join you for a hike.
Bringing your loved one along with you to a community pool.
Inviting your loved one to take an aerobics class with you.
 Some people with pain disorder may turn to drugs or alcohol or both to cope with the pain. However, this can interfere with your loved one’s treatment. If you have noticed that your loved one is using alcohol or drugs to deal with the pain, offer to help.


Try saying something like, “I have noticed that you have been drinking on a daily basis and that worries me. Can I make an appointment with your doctor so that we can talk about other ways to control your pain?”

, The food you eat can play a role in your mental health along with many other factors.If your loved one does not follow a very healthy diet, then another way you can help is by encouraging your loved one to eat healthier.


You can help your loved one follow a healthy diet by preparing healthy meals for your loved one, pointing out healthy choices when you eat out together, and following a healthy diet yourself so that you can be a good example.

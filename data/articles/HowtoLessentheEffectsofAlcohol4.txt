 Hangovers are best eliminated with time. Since alcohol makes you feel sleepy, you might reach for the caffeinated beverage. This won’t work for you. Your body needs time to recuperate. Take a nap. This is the best way to get rid of that headache and to get your better judgement back., A warm shower will raise your core temperature. A warmer temperature will prepare your body for sleep, which will in turn allow you to bypass the horrendous headache of the dreaded hangover.

 Since the jellies are located diagonally, keep your matches on the top-left and bottom-right areas. This will enable you to break the licorice and meringues blocking the jellies.
 Make matches with the candies covered in licorice to break them. You need to break the licorice first before you can break the meringues.
 Once youâ€™ve gotten through the licorice, make matches beside the meringues to break them as well. The jellies are underneath the meringues, so you have to clear them first.
 Plan to get a Striped candy and a Candy Bomb together. When you do, all similar-colored candies of the Striped candy will be turned to Striped candies, multiplying its effects and clearing up a whole lot of columns and rows. This can help you clear out more licorice, meringues, time bombs, chocolate, and jellies at once.


A Striped candy is a special candy that results from matching four candies in a row. When you use a Striped candy as part of a match, it will clear out a whole row or column from the board.
A Candy Bomb is a special candy that results from matching five candies in a row. It can be difficult to get, but not impossible.

 Find 3-4 people who would like to play Slither.io with you.

Get together at a private meeting place where you can set up all of your computers, or you can alternatively use headphone sets to connect with each other over a chat line.
Optional: print out a copy of these instructions so you can have a hard copy to look at the protocol systems when playing this game.;

If you do not do this properly, you and your teammates may not all reach the same server.
 It is best to play this game using a computer and not a smartphone because a computer mouse will have a faster reaction speed for maneuvering your slithering avatar the than the touchscreen for your phone.


To increase the speed of your mouse, go to your computer settings or type in "mouse" on the search bar from your start menu to reach the "Mouse Properties." From "Mouse Properties," click the tab for "Pointer Options," and use your cursor/arrow to click and drag the pointer speed to the rightmost or highest setting.
Another way to increase your reaction time and prevent the game from buffering is to close all of your other idle computer programs.
To increase reaction precision is to the keep the mouse cursor/arrow nearby the eyes of your avatar in order to allow for quick turning.
A final tip to increase your scope of vision is to "Restore Down" your computer screen using the button next to the "X" button to close your web browser. This will cause the focus to zoom out, and show more of the game's playing field.



Click the "Share on Twitter" or "Share on Facebook" button in the lower right-hand corner to share about the game and to unlock the custom skins.
After sharing, click on the "Change Skin" button in the lower left-hand corner of the Slither.io game homepage.
Click the right and left arrows to survey the different types of skins in the inventory.
Discuss with your teammates which custom skin you would all like to use to identify each other by. Choosing the same skin will prevent you from accidentally attacking your teammates when you are playing the game.
It is preferable to chose a unique skin like the "green snake with one eye" or the "bright green snake with the smiley face" because fewer other players use those skins.
 Each team member must assume one of the following Nicknames: {(Commander=1)}, {(Hunter=2)}, {(Hunter=3)}, and {(Hunter=4)}. Using the set brackets {} and parentheses () makes the name unique and easy to identify so you do not accidentally attack team members. Using these names also makes it easier to monitor the position of the Commander on the "Leaderboard" in the upper right-hand corner of the gameplay screen.


Discuss which Nickname each of you shall choose to prevent repeating a Nickname and to be clear on which Protocol System you will follow.
Once you have decided which Nickname you will use, enter it into the "Nickname" bar on the Slither.io homepage and then you can click the "Play" button to start the game.
 Larger orbs will make you longer than small orbs. "Moving orbs" will give you the most length per orb, but you must sacrifice some of your length to reach them (see Game Rule 3 below).
Don't run into other players. As a Hunter, you must try to get other players to run into you so you may "kill" them to gain their length by eating their orbs.
Once longer, click and hold your left mouse button to increase speed. You will lose some of your length as you do this, but it can be helpful when trying to "kill" other players by getting them to run into you.



In the upper right-hand corner there is the "Leaderboard." The goal is to make the Commander long enough to rank as the "#1" position.
In the lower left-hand corner "Your Length" and "Your Rank" are shown.
The arena map is located in the lower right-hand corner of the gameplay page. The light gray speckled areas signify large amounts of colored orbs. Larger patches of light gray speckles are likely to be Bloodbath zones.
Do not go beyond the borders of the arena of the Gray Zone into the Red Zone. Your avatar will be vaporized on contact.
Use the Quadrant System to communicate your location to your team members.
 As a hunter - {(Hunter=2)}, {(Hunter=3)}, and {(Hunter=4)} - use these strategies:


Length < 100 = Expendable Mode (EM): You may make risky attempts to kill larger players.
Length > 100 = Defensive Mode (DM): Stay away from other players and increase your length by eating the colored orbs. Chase after the moving colored orbs when they are close enough.
Length > 200 = Attack Mode (AM): Try to get other players to run into you so you can gain their length.
Length > 300 = Proceed to "Bloodbath" Zone: Go to an area populated by lots of other players and try to get them to run into you or wait until they run into each other.
Length > 1,000 = Hunter Mode (HM): You have reached official Hunter status. Your goal is to now trick as many other players into running into you as possible to get longer.
Length > 2,000 = Circle Mode 1 (CM1): You may now trap other players by encircling them and forcing them to run into you.
Length > 3,000 = Circle Mode 2 (CM2): You may now trap other players by encircling them and forcing them to run into you.
Length > 4,000 = Proceed to Commander (PC): Once you have gotten between 4,000 and 5,000 in length, you must then go to the location of the commander.
Length > 10,000 = 2nd Commander Status (C2): Once you have gotten to this stage, and are still shorter than current Commander, you are the Second in Command. This means, if the Commander is destroyed before reaching the #1 position on the Leaderboard, you will be the next in line to be the Commander. Remember, though, that the Commander remains the Commander until you have reach this stage and the Commander is jeopardized, you have reached the New Commander Status and are given consent to take over, OR the Commander decides to voluntarily relinquish their position outright.
Length > Commander+500 = New Commander (NC): Once you have gotten at least 500 longer than the current Commander, you may – with the current Commander's consent – take the position of the Commander.
 As a Command - {(Commander=1)} - use the following strategies:


Do not proceed to Expendable Mode (EM)
Do not proceed to a "Bloodbath" Zone
Length > 100 = Defensive Mode (DM): Stay away from other players and increase your length by eating the colored orbs. Chase after the moving colored orbs when they are close enough.
Length > 500 = Proceed to a Quadrant (PQ):
Length > 1,000 = Commander Mode (CM): You have reached official Commander Status. Your goal is to stay away from all other players, eat orbs, and eat team players to increase your length after they have reached the "Proceed to Commander" Status.
Length > 5,000 = Remain in Outer Region (ROQ): Choose one outer quadrant (UROQ, LROQ, ULOQ, or LLOQ), enter it, announce entry to team members, and stay at that location.
Rank > #50 = Hunters Bypass Circle Mode 1 (Bypass CM2): When you have reached a length of 3,000 or more, Hunters may bypass CM2 and go directly to the Commander to contribute to his/her length.
Rank > #10 = Hunters Bypass Circle Mode 2 (Bypass CM1): When you have reached a length of 2,000 or more, Hunters may bypass CM1 and go directly to the Commander to contribute to his/her length.
Rank #1 = Relieve Commander Status: Once the Commander has successfully reached #1 on the Leaderboard, he/she may pass on the duty of Commander to the Hunter with the greatest length.
 To learn how to maneuver to attack other players and to learn how to defend against other player's attacks, the best method is to go into the midst of a highly populated area (normally found in the Bloodbath Regions of the Quadrant System).



Enter your Nickname and press "Play."
Announce your entry position on the Quadrant System to your teammates. Do this in order: {(Commander=1)}, {(Hunter=2)}, {(Hunter=3)}, and {(Hunter=4)}. 
Follow the Commander or Hunter Protocol System. The Hunters must regularly update teammates about their statuses in the Protocol System (EM, DM, AM, etc.). The Commander should consistently update his/her location on the Quadrant System so that Hunters can proceed to the Commander to contribute to his/her length when they achieve PC, or are able to carry out Bypass CM2 or CM1.
 You have achieved "Domination" when each player can, in succession, become the #1 player on the Leaderboard by following the Hunter-Commander Protocol correctly. Another objective for Domination could be to achieve the most points.

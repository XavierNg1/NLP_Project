 Sometimes, caring for someone in their home can be dangerous. The person’s house may be cluttered or have furniture or other things in paths you walk through the house. Discuss changing the around things in the house so you can avoid injury.Make sure to be respectful. Though you are the caregiver, it is not your home.
Try saying, “Is it okay if I move this stool out of the way? I can place it close to you in case you need it” or “May I move some things around in the floor? I know you may not like to change the way you have things arranged, but if I move a few things, we both can walk more easily through the house.”

, When you take care of someone, you may have to do things like change bandages or other duties that may put you in contact with contaminants. Though the person you are taking care of might not like that you are wearing gloves or a face mask, you should protect yourself from getting sick or coming in contact with bodily fluids.If the person doesn’t like it, don’t give in and compromise your health. Tell them, “I’m sorry that the gloves and mask bother you. Wearing them makes me feel more comfortable, and it is safer for us if I do.”

, Part of caring for someone might be helping out around the house. This can lead to injury or strain on your body if not done safely. To help with this, think about ways to make the chores easier for you.Use long-handled tools to dust, wipe, or mop hard to reach places. Use these to limit the amount of bending you do. If a long-handled tool won’t help, try using a step stool to reach high places.
When bending on the floor, place something under your knees to protect them.
Lift heavier objects with your legs instead of your back. Hold it as close to your body as possible. Ask for help if something is too heavy to move.

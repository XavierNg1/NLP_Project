 To prepare the electric griddle for frying the French toast, set its temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) and allow it to heat fully. Once it’s hot, grease the surface of the griddle with butter to keep the bread from sticking.If you don’t have an electric griddle, you can fry the French toast in a skillet. Heat it on medium and grease it with butter as you would with the griddle.
 Add 1 ½ cups (355 ml) of eggnog, 5 large eggs, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of ground nutmeg, and ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of vanilla extract to a large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re fully combined.You can substitute rum extract for the vanilla if you prefer.
 After you’ve mixed the batter, transfer it to a shallow dish or bowl so you can easily coat the bread. A 11-inch by 7-inch (28-cm by 18-cm) baking dish works well., Take 12 slices of bread, and dip them two at a time into the batter. Make sure to flip the slices over so both sides are fully coated with the batter.Shake the bread off over the bowl to remove any excess batter.
 Once the bread is coated with the batter, place it on the griddle. Allow it to cook for approximately 3 to 5 minutes or until the bottom is a golden brown color.Make sure to keep an eye on the French toast as it’s cooking. It can burn easily.
 When the bottom of the bread is golden brown, use a spatula to flip it over. Let the other side of the bread cook for approximately 2 to 3 more minutes or until it is golden brown too., Lift the cooked toast off of the griddle, and transfer to a plate. Top it with warm maple syrup and serve immediately.For a more decadent breakfast, you can add sweetened whipped cream to the top of the eggnog French toast.

,, Ganking is when another member is in the process of kicking the hacky-sack and someone steals it from them in mid-kick.
,, You'll look pretty stupid when the hack is laying 5 inches (12.7Â cm) in front of your feet.
 Which is somebody who continues on for a while showing off their moves. Nobody likes a hog.
 When you are new to a circle, get a feel for the mood before you start flapping your mouth.
 If you are, go and get it, regardless of who kicked it last. Note that this procedure varies depending on the dynamic of the group. In some groups, members will say "not it", and the last person to say this will be forced to get the hack, regardless of their place in the circle.
 The game will go slowly and be more embarrassing for you if you drop the hack every time it's passed to you.

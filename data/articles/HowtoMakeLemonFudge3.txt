 Add ½ cup (128 g) of melted coconut butter, 2 tablespoons (27 g) of virgin coconut oil, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of fresh lemon juice, 1 tablespoon (20 g) of pure maple syrup, and the zest from 1 lemon to a food processor. Pulse the mixture together until it is completely smooth.You can also use a blender to mix up the fudge.
You can substitute stevia drops for the maple syrup if you prefer. However, you’ll need to increase the coconut butter amount by 1 tablespoon (16 g) if you use the stevia.
 Once the fudge mixture is fully blended, use a spatula to spread it into a freezer-safe plastic container. Cover the container with the lid or plastic wrap, and chill the fudge in the freezer 2 to 3 hours, or until firm.You can also transfer the fudge mixture to candy molds if you prefer.
 When the fudge is fully set, remove it from the freezer. Use a sharp knife to cut it into even squares, and serve.Store any leftover fudge in the refrigerator. It should stay fresh for up to a week.

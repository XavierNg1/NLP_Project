 The engineer is more valuable than the medic if he is on the defending team at the start of the match. His teleporters and sentry also keep your team in lock-down.


The medic is more valuable if he is a good medic and is healing everyone.
 Heavies deal a ton of damage and have a ton of health. Stab them and you will save your team a whole lot of trouble.



The best method to use is the stab and sap. Stab the engineer before sapping all his buildings. If you cannot do that, sap and stab. Sap the sentry and stab the engineer. If you miss the stab and the engineer comes after you, shoot like mad at the sentry. If you die destroying a L3 Sentry, it is worth it.
It is recommended to watch some videos on how to perfect the above methods.

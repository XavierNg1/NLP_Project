 Add 1 part vinegar to 1 part water. Mix well. This solution is great when you are in a hurry and low on supplies. This simple vinegar solution works great for mildew.
 Put vinegar solution in spray bottle and spray, or use a clean rag or sponge to apply, vinegar onto the plastic surface.
 Rub down the plastic with the vinegar solution to remove any grime.
 Use water to rinse off the plastic. Depending on the item you can do this with a hose or faucet, or with more delicate items you may need to wipe it down with a wet cloth.
 Dry your now clean plastic with a clean dry towel.

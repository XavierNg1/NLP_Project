 A scent handshake is a way to introduce two animals before they meet each other. To perform a scent handshake, you will need a couple of rags or old washcloths. Use rags or washcloths that you won’t miss in case they get soiled or ripped., Take one of the cloths and rub it on your dog’s back and rear end. Then, take the other cloth and rub it on your cat’s chin and the sides of her face. You may want to use two different color cloths so that you can tell them apart., After you have gotten your pets’ scents on the cloths, give each pet the other pet’s cloth. Give the cat’s cloth to the dog and give the dog’s cloth to the cat. Allow your pets to sniff the cloths and get used to the scents for a few days before you introduce them to each other.

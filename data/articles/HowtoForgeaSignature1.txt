 Tracing paper is made to be translucent, so you can clearly see what's underneath it. If you don't have a piece of tracing paper handy, you can use a piece of thin white computer paper.;
, Use a steady hand and slowly trace over the lines, loops and dots in the signature. Try not to shake your hand or pick up the pencil as you trace. In order to produce a convincing signature, pay attention to the following:


The thickness of the lines. People naturally apply more pressure to certain parts of their signature. Maybe the right side of the person's "l" loop is thicker than the left side, for example.
The slant of the signature. As you trace, pay attention to the natural slant of the signature and be sure to follow it.
The order of the letter formation. For instance, does it look like the person crossed his Ts dotted his Is after completing the rest of the signature? This can affect the way the final signature looks. It's a subtle matter, but it can mean the difference between a decent forgery and one that's easy to call out as fake.
 Be sure it's aligned correctly so that it will look like it was signed in a natural way. Many people don't sign their signatures neatly and in a straight line, so take this into account when you're positioning the signature.
 Use a pencil or another pointed instrument to press fairly hard over the traced signature to make an impression of the signature on the desired forging area. Don't press so hard that you tear the paper or change the way the signature will look.


A deep impression will be noticeable as a sign of forgery, so try to make it as faint as possible while still leaving enough of an indent that you'll be able to go over it in pen.
 Carefully go over the indented signature with a pen. Don't lift your hand or make any shaky movements - try to make it look natural.

 While some things will vary depending on your body type and personal style, you'll need to stick to some basics to avoid scaring most men away.


Wear deodorant. Some men are lucky enough to have fewer sweat glands and may not need to use deodorant on a daily basis. However, most do. Reapply deodorant as needed, especially in warm weather or after exercise.
Shower at least once a day. Use soap and water to rinse away dirt, dead skin, and bacterial buildup. Some people with fine or oily hair may need to shampoo daily, but most only need to wash their hair a few times a week or even less. Just don't go more than 14 days without a shampoo.Keep your nails clean and free from dirt. Your nails can be any length, shape, or color you prefer. If your nails are longer, buff out breaks with a nail file to keep them from snagging on hair and clothing.
 Facial hair grows at different rates between men. However, most men who shave do so each morning.


Even if you sport a full beard, you will need to shape it to look sharp. Shave or pluck away stray hairs on your face or below your neckline.
While stubble is currently popular, avoid growing it out too far to avoid looking unkempt., Smooth, healthy skin has universal appeal. Keep yours looking its best. This doesn't mean you have to go overboard with lotions and creams. There are, however, some basics you should cover.


Moisturize after you shower. Hydrated skin reduces the appearance of wrinkles.Protect your skin from the sun. Sun damage can cause premature aging in your skin. Wear a sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or above.

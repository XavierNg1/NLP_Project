 This will give you the numerator of the product. The numerators are the numbers above the fraction bar.

The product is the answer to a multiplication problem.

Unlike when adding fractions, multiplying fractions does not require having a least common denominator. This is because when taking a part of a fraction, you are changing the number of pieces in the whole.  

For example, if you are multiplying 52{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{2}}} and 312{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{12}}}, the numerator of your answer (product) will be 15, since 5×3=15{\displaystyle 5\times 3=15}.
 This will give you the denominator of the product. The denominators are the numbers below the fraction bar.

For example, if you are multiplying 52{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{2}}} and 312{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{12}}}, the denominator of your product will be 24, since 2×12=24{\displaystyle 2\times 12=24}.
 To get the product of the two fractions, simply put together the numerator and denominator you found by multiplying.

For example, if you found the numerator by multiplying 5×3{\displaystyle 5\times 3} and the denominator by multiplying 2×12{\displaystyle 2\times 12}, your answer (product) is 1524{\displaystyle {\frac {15}{24}}}.
 Usually you will be asked to reduce, or simplify a final answer if it is a fraction. To simplify, find the highest number that will divide evenly into the numerator and denominator,then divide the numerator and denominators by that number.

For example, if your answer is 1524{\displaystyle {\frac {15}{24}}}, you can divide the numerator and denominator evenly by 3. 15/3=5{\displaystyle 15/3=5} and 24/3=8{\displaystyle 24/3=8}, so the simplified fraction is 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}}. Since 5 cannot be divided evenly by any other number, you cannot simplify 58{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{8}}} any further.

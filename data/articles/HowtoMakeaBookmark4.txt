 On a piece of scratch paper, draw a square measuring 5 x 5 inches with a pencil. Take a ruler and divide the square into four sections, creating four small squares within the one large square. Then, erase the top right square so that you have three small squares forming an ‘L’ shape.
 You should have split this square into two triangles. Do the same with the bottom right square, so that only the bottom left square is left in its original shape.
 Use your pencil to quickly shade the top-most and bottom-most triangles that you’ve drawn. You should be left with a shape that is comprised of a square on the bottom right, with two triangles attached to the top and right sides.
 Cut along the perimeter of the shape you have created, cutting off the shaded-in triangles. You should be left with a shape similar to a left-pointing arrow.
 Take the shape you have just cut, and place it onto a piece of cardstock or craft paper of your choice. Cut out the shape from your nice paper once you have traced it.
 Fold each triangle along the side still connected to the square. The two triangles should overlap and form a square-shape again.
 Add glue to the top-triangle, and glue it to the top of the bottom triangle to create a pocket. If you like, cut off the base of the square along the bottom of the triangle pocket to form a symmetrical figure. Otherwise, your bookmark form is complete!

, Add additional pieces of decorative paper to the front and back of your triangle pocket. Consider drawing a picture or writing your favorite quote or song lyrics onto the front. When you’re happy with the product, you’re finished! Slide it over the corner of the page you need to mark in your favorite book.

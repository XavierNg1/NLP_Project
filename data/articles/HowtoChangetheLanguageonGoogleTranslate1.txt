, The language on the left side of the screen is the language you would like to translate a word or phrase from, and the language on the right side displays the language you would like your word or phrase translated to.


If you're changing the language input field, you'll have an option to select Detect language, which is a feature that analyzes your input text and chooses the most appropriate language. This is useful if you want to translate a word or phrase and you aren't sure what language it is in.
 You should see a menu with languages appear; selecting a language from here will apply it to its related field.


You may need to scroll down to find the language you want.
You may also tap the two opposite-facing arrows at the top of the page to reverse the output and input fields.
Languages with a downward-facing arrow next to them have an offline translation file available.

 If you understand why your nose is leaky you can suit your response for effective treatment. Basic causes of runny noses, and potential cures, include:



Allergies: Take an over the counter antihistamine.

Cold/Sickness: Manage symptoms with steam and decongestants. See a doctor if symptoms worsen or last longer than 48 hours.

Clogging: Blow your nose and try and clear the irritant.

Stress/Lifestyle choices: Get plenty of sleep and relax for a night. Manage symptoms until gone.;
, When your nose is runny, blow it through. The best way to handle a runny nose is to remove the fluid. If you do not manage to get the irritant out of your nostrils, try a neti pod (detailed below) or other nasal irrigation product!

, These points on your body can be used to relax your sinuses, helping slow down the flow of a runny nose. Apply light pressure to each nostril, closing and opening them slowly. Then rub above your eyes and on your ear lobes to complete the technique.


You can use a washcloth soaked in warm water for even better results.
 This will help reduce the mucus that are produced by runny noses. You can also take a hot shower or bath, turn on a humidifier, or lean over a pot/bowl of hot water. Add eucalyptus oil, camphor spirit, peppermint oil or soda for an extra kick.
 There are a variety of prescription and over the counter sprays, pills, and creams to help manage your runny nose, including:


Nasal sprays, preferably those containing olopatadine (prescription only)
Vapor rubs and topical decongestants.
Magnesium (400mg) and or zinc (15mg) supplements can help open up your cells and nasal passageway.

 Before proceeding to the mobile spying application section, read over this carefully. Remember to always research federal and state laws on remote cellphone monitoring. Most U.S. states require consent from only one party to record electronic communications and phone calls.,


Consent from both parties to record electronic data is required in 12 states: California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Washington.
Material stored on cellphones is considered private property and cannot be accessed in most situations without both parties consent.
Another way around this (with prepaid devices you should be able to log into the account via the providers website (or built in application) and change the account name.) All without changing or interrupting service.
 This is not a lie and could easily persuade them to let you install the program. You may now proceed to the ideal mobile monitoring method.

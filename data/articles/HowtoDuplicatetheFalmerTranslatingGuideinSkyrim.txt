 The stone can be found in Calcelmo’s Museum, which is inside the Undertone Keep in Markarth. Markarth is located in the southwest corner of Skyrim. Once inside Calcelmo’s Museum you will be able to access Calcelmo’s Tower, which is where the stone is located.


Inside the tower you will find a study room containing the large stone with engravings on it. The stone is a large rectangular slab which has designs on the top of it with a face in the middle of these designs. Below this is some small writing which is what you will be copying to paper.;
, Once you have located the stone, you will need to locate a roll of paper. There are numerous pieces of paper in the room directly behind you if you are facing the front of the stone. Next you will need something to write with.
 A piece of charcoal can be found in the same room where the paper was located. Again, there is a lot lying around on tables in the room so you will have no trouble locating one. Once you have one piece of paper and one piece of charcoal, you will have the necessary tools to copy the writing on Calcelmo’s Stone.
 Once the roll of paper and charcoal is in your inventory, head back to the stone and click on it to start copying the writing. Once complete (it is instant), you will receive Calcelmo’s Stone Rubbing. You can use this to continue the quest.

 This quick, no-cook recipe is a great go-to choice when you don't want to spend much time putting your clay together. All you need are the following supplies:


2 cups cornstarch
1 cup white school glue
Food coloring (gel or liquid)
Bowl

, 2 cups is a good amount to start with. With this simple recipe, you can easily add more; you'll just need more glue as well.
 Add small amounts of glue to the container while stirring. Keep adding glue until the mixture reaches a good consistencyâ€”it should end up being about two parts cornstarch, one part glue.









If it's too crumbly, add more glue.
If it's too sticky, add more cornstarch.
 Add food coloring to the bowl and knead it in with your hands. If you want the clay to have a richer hue, add more coloring until it looks the way you want it to.









If you want to make clay in several colors, separate the batch into two or more parts and color each one separately.
 You can use sandcastle molds and cookie cutters, or you can let your imagination run wild. Once you're satisfied with what you've made, set it in a cool, dry place to harden. In a few hours you can paint it and then voila! Your very own air dry clay creation.

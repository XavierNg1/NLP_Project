 This marinade sounds Mexican in flavor, but appeals to many different people. It involves fresh ground pepper, salt, lime, beer, and chili powder.









Transfer one (light or dark) beer into a bowl. Make sure the bowl is big enough to cover nearly all of the steak in order to tenderize and infuse it. Squeeze a full lime to the marinade sauce and season with chili powder.
Soak the beef in the marinade for at least 30 minutes and as long as 6 hours inside a refrigerator.
Before grilling, give the steak a good rubbing of fresh ground pepper and salt. Cook as directed above.
 This marinade is a classic riff on a recipe that is usually reserved for flank steak but that works just as well with classic steak. It involves soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, and honey.









In a blender, blend:

2 cloves of garlic
2 teaspoons ginger
2/3 cup of soy sauce
4 tablespoons olive oil
4 tablespoons lemon juice
4 tablespoons honey


Soak the beef in the marinade for at least 30 minutes and as long as 6 hours inside a refrigerator.
Before grilling, give the steak a good rubbing of fresh ground pepper and salt. Cook as directed above.
 It makes an absolutely great rub for other cuts of meat, including poultry.









In a coffee grinder, blend:

1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns
6 star anise
1 1/2 teaspoons whole cloves
1 stick cinnamon
2 tablespoons fennel seeds.


Rub the entire steak with the five-spice blend and let sit until room temperature. Cook as directed above.

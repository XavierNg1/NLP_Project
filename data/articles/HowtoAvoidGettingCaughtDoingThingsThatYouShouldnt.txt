 If you're going to take a school lunch, pretend like you're on the list and take it nonchalantly. A teacher or worker nearby can work to your advantage ("they wouldn't steal right in front of me, so they must not be stealing") If you're in the halls when you're not supposed to be, walk briskly with your shoulders back. If you meet a teacher, look them in the eye, greet them, and keep moving.;
, If you're in the situation where you are not otherwise suspicious, rapid movements or such will draw attention to yourself. Similarly, if you are actively being suspected, act with extreme confidence. If you look at your feet or fidget, you're practically admitting your guilt.
 Make sure that you do not confide in the people who believe what you're doing is wrong. When pressed, they will tell on you for "your own good" or to save their own skin.
 If youâ€™re taking a soda pop from a machine, give it to them. They'll remember it, and will also hesitate to snitch because they have enjoyed the ill-gotten gains. Remember that some people will refuse this offer because they are trying to be honest.
, Try bending the truth, and putting truth in every lie. Lies are too easy to prove wrong. If you must lie, tell a lie that can only be disproved by yourself. In other words, make it your word against theirs. (See step 3 for the reason why). Also remember that direct lying creates a reputation. - If you get caught lying once, people will always doubt your truthfulness and you will be considered guilty even if the fault isn't yours.

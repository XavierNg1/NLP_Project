 The best way to hide your forehead is by going to a salon and getting bangs. A straight across bang that gets gradually longer on the sides is the most versatile and fitting for larger foreheads. However, there are many different types of bangs to choose from. Flip through a magazine and pick a favorite type to ask your stylist for, and be sure to go with one that best fits your face shape.


Opt for curtain bangs or textured side bangs if your face is round.Oval and long face shapes look better with a below-the-brow wispy bang.;
, If you want to wear your hair up, part your hair down the middle and put it in a loose bun. Pull a couple of pieces out of the top front and curl them with a curling iron on low heat to create a nice face-framing effect.Avoid the slicked back look. Unlike the low, loose up-do, a tightly pulled back ponytail or bun wonâ€™t be very flattering., A big forehead often means a seemingly longer face. While flat, straight hair will make your face look even longer, hairstyles with a lot of wave and volume bring balance to your head shape by having a subtle widening effect.Also create volume by using volumizing hair products, curling your hair, or blowing it dry with a hair dryer and a round brush.
 Get an asymmetrical bob with a dramatic side part. The side part breaks up your forehead and draws attention to your eyes while the longer front section makes your neckline a focal point.

 If there are heavy rains or floods in your area, build a mound of soil 2–3 feet (0.9 m). (0.6–0.9 m) high and 4–10 feet (1.2–3.0 m). (1.2–3 m) in diameter.This will help keep water from pooling around the papaya's roots, reducing the chance of injury or death.


Read the instructions below before you build your mound, to learn about soil preparation.
 Make the hole three times as deep and wide as the planting pot or root ball, in the plant's intended permanent location. Choose a sunny, well-drained location, about 10 to 20 feet (3.1 to 6.1 meters) from buildings or other plants.Make a separate hole for each papaya plant.
 Unless your garden soil is already rich in nutrients, replace some of the soil in the hole or mound with compost and mix thoroughly.


Do not mix with manure, as this can burn roots.
 Papaya trees can die from disease after transplantation. Follow the instructions on a gardening fungicide and apply it to the soil to reduce this risk., Add the altered soil back into the hole or pile it in a mound, until the remaining depth is roughly equal to the depth of the potting soil or root ball of the plant being transplanted. Remove the papaya plants from their containers, one at a time, and plant each in its own hole at the same depth as it sat in the container. Handle them carefully to avoid breaking or scraping the roots.
 Fill the remaining space in the hole with the same soil. Pack gently to remove air pockets if the soil isn't filling the spaces between the roots. Water the newly planted papaya seedlings until the soil surrounding the root ball is thoroughly moistened.

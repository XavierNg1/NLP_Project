 Compress trash into the trash bag as much as you can while it is still in the trash can. This process maximizes the amount of available space so that you can place more trash into the bag.


Compacting the trash can yield cost savings because you will buy trash bags less often.
Be careful not to tear the trash bag when compressing the contents.
Do not use your hand to compress trash. This could result in injury if there are unseen sharp objects in the trash. You can use a hand held compressor instead.
Use an electronic trash compacter to reduce the volume of your trash. An electronic trash compactor can turn six bags of trash into one bag., If you are unable to compress overflowing trash, place the overflow into a new bag. If there is a lot of room left in the overflow bag, it may be best to place it into the trash can until it is full.


If you have a trash can that is not lined with a bag, place a bag over the top of the trash can, then turn the can upside down. This will allow the contents to fall into the bag. Take your time so that you do not drop trash all over the floor.
 Keep a look out for hazardous items, such as broken glass, knives, and toxic substances. These items may require special handling for disposal.Put on gloves. It is a good practice to use gloves when handling trash. This is especially true if the trash contains liquids.
Secure sharp objects so that they do not harm you or anyone else who may encounter them. For example, place broken glass in a labeled and puncture resistant container. You can use a box as the container. Place the box labeled “broken glass” in the designated trash pick up location.
Acids, pesticides, fluorescent lamps, and batteries are examples of items that must be recycled. These items should not go in the trash. You can contact your local waste management company for questions about toxic substances.

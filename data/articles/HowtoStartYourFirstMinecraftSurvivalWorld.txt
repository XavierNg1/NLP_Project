 Wood is the most used block in Minecraft, alongside dirt and stone. Once you have found a tree, break the wood and craft it into planks. If you cannot see any wood, walk around for a bit. Trees are practically everywhere, so it won't take too long to find one.;
, If you don't have a lot of wood, get some more or build it out of dirt. Don't make it too big to start off with, but you can improve it later. Still, make it big enough to fit all of the basic equipment inside- 5x5 or 6x6 is optimal.
 You will need four planks of wood, which you can get from one piece of normal wood. The crafting table is by far the most used tool in Minecraft. Place it in your home or any other desired place.
 By now, the sun has nearly set. Monsters will spawn soon, so go to your crafting table and make: some sticks; a wooden sword; a wooden axe and a wooden shovel. Next, to make a bed you will need three wood planks and three wool. You get wool by killing sheep. If you don't want to kill sheep, make a stone pickaxe and getÂ two iron. Smelt it in a furnace (you will need eight cobblestone to make one) and make some shears to shear sheep instead.
 Place your crafted bed in your home and sleep in it. Sleeping in a bed allows you to skip the night, and set your spawn so if you die you spawn where you last slept.


Well done: you have survived your first night! Now go forth, build a mansion, mine precious diamonds, and kill the evil enderdragon!

 Use a tape measure to measure the wrist of the future owner. After making your measurements add two or three inches to the measurements. The extra amount is for adjustments and leeway for braiding., Measure out the tape based off the lengths you took down. Cut out three strips of duct tape that are equal lengths. You can use different colors that complement each other for a flashy accessory., Fold each strip of duct tape lengthwise. Fold the adhesive into itself so that there isn’t any sticky side of the tape leftover. Attach each folded strip together using tape or a binder clip at one end of the tape., Start by laying each strip side by side. Wrap the leftmost strip over the rest of the strips. Wrap the rightmost strip up and over the left strip. Now wrap the center strip over the rightmost strip. Wrap the leftmost strip around the center. Continue this pattern until you reach the end of the bracelet., Finish up the bracelet by taping or stapling the other end of the braid. Wrap the bracelet around the wearer’s wrist and then tape the two ends together. Ensure that the bracelet is not too tight.

 It's quite likely that you already have the basics but just in case, here's what you need to get started:


A laptop or a desktop computer. The class will need access to approximately one per four children for this to work well.






A whiteboard or blackboard where you can write down the questions being asked.
Paper and pens. This lets children take notes to share. Remember too that writing on paper has a mind and body connection that is different from typing, and many creative people insist that this connection sparks different ways of thinking, so encourage both.
Webcam, microphone, creative software for graphics manipulation/videos/music making, etc.
Name tags. This is optional but it might be necessary if the children are younger or don't know each other that well yet. And it can be a good way to make it clear who is the helper.

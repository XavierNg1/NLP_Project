 The more rice you buy at a time, the less expensive the rice flour becomes. If you have a warehouse store in your local area, consider buying the rice in bulk so you can make rice flour in large amounts or in small batches whenever you need it, regardless of quantity. A 25-pound (11.33 kilogram) bag should produce enough rice flour to last for several months.

, You need a blender or mixer that works specifically to crack grains; if you have one for wet ingredients, it will not work.
 If you use more than this amount, you could compromise the quality of the resulting rice flour. If you want to make more than this at one time, do it in multiple batches.
 Mix it gradually until you get it as fine as desired. The finer the grain, the better it will work in baked goods because it will not drastically alter the texture of the final product.
 You can also use it to thicken soups, sauces, and gravies. It works as a thickener because it will not allow the liquid to separate from the other ingredients.
 If the flour is not stored in an air-tight container, it may become moldy. You can store it in the freezer to help prevent the mold from forming, but if it is not in an air-tight container, it will absorb moisture and odor from other items. Brown rice flour typically lasts up to 5 months but may spoil sooner if the bran contains a lot of oil. White rice flour, when stored properly, is thought to have an indefinite shelf life.

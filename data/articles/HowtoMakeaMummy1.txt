 Otherwise, the head of the mummy will be difficult to wrap.


Don’t use someone else’s doll without asking permission.
Inexpensive dolls can be bought at grocery stores and discount department stores.;
, Add one part water to one part flour in a large mixing bowl. Next, whisk the mixture together to create a smooth paste.The paste should have the consistency of pancake batter. If it’s too thick, add a few splashes of water. If it’s too thin, sprinkle in more flour.


For example, if you use one cup of flour, you will need one cup of water.
Add a tablespoon of salt to the paste if you want to prevent molding.
 Tear out small, thin strips of unruled white paper or thin cloth. You can also use newspaper, tissue paper, or paper towels.If you’re making an authentic-looking mummy, choose white paper or fabric. Otherwise, the mummy will be multicolored.


The strips should be about 3-4 inches long (7.5 to 10 centimeters) and half an inch wide (1.3 centimeters).
 First, dip a strip of paper or fabric into your paste and coat each side. Gently squeeze the strip to remove any excess paste. Next, wrap the strip around the mummy as tightly as you can.Wrap the arms against the body. Mummies usually don’t have individually wrapped arms.
If you decide to do more than one layer of papier mâché, let each layer dry completely before adding another.
 Leave the mummy in a sunny spot for twenty-four to forty-eight hours. This will guarantee that any layers have dried. Otherwise, the mummy may mold.


To test whether or not the mummy is dry, press it gently with a finger. The papier mâché should be chalky and stiff.
To speed the drying process, place the mummy under a fan.

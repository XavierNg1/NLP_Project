 Check that your parents are in a good mood, and then bring up the subject of rabbits. Ask your parents if you can have a rabbit. Be sure to tell them about all your research (see the next step).
 Include pictures of rabbits, information you've learned on rabbits, costs, and why you think you should have a rabbit. However, some parents will find this dull or a bit too try-hard. It's quite sufficient to have all of your facts sorted and to talk articulately about your wants and the understanding of the responsibilities involved.
 They will know about the costs involved, the suitability of your environment and the long-term prospects of rabbit care given your family's circumstances. Respect that decision, and if it does happen to be no, ask whether you might at least get involved in some sort of way with animals such as shelter volunteering or doing courses on animal care. This will demonstrate your enthusiasm and commitment long-term.

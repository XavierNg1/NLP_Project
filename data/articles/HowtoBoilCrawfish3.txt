 Place the crawfish in a crawfish basket, made out of wire with a handle for lowering it into the pot. Crawfish baskets are used so that the crawfish can boil in the top part of the water while the vegetables cook underneath. Let the crawfish boil in the water for 5 minutes.


If you have a large strainer that fits over the top of the pot, this can be used as a substitute for the crawfish basket.
Crawfish baskets are available online or at stores that sell barbecue equipment.
 Once the crawfish are inside the pot, turn off the heat and put the lid on top to allow the crawfish to cook gently for another 30 minutes.
 After 30 minutes, remove the lid and check to see if the crawfish are done. The best way to tell is by removing a crawfish and eating it.


If the texture is rubbery, the crawfish need more time to cook.If they're on the verge of falling apart, remove the crawfish from the pot immediately, as they're in danger of overcooking.

 Mix one cup linseed oil, four tablespoons of carnauba wax, two tablespoons of beeswax, and half a cup of apple cider vinegar. Put the ingredients over boiling water by using a double boiler. Heat the wax, and stir frequently until the waxes have melted.








Carnauba wax can be bought at auto stores.
If you donâ€™t have a double boiler, put the ingredients in a clean tin can. Set the can in middle of a pot of boiling water. Be careful not to scald yourself when removing the can.
 Once the waxes have melted into one another, you should pour the wax into a different container, such as a jar or Pyrex measuring cup. Let the wax cool until it is solid. Once the wax is solid, it is ready to be used.









If you use a container with a lid, you can save the cooled wax for later.
 Once the wax is cool, you can scoop it up with a clean cloth. Apply it to the headlights. Work it across the entire headlight using circular motions.
 With a different cloth, buff off the wax. Make sure that there are no streaks or residue left on afterwards. The headlight should look polished and sparkling.

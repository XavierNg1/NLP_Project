 Even webcam is better than asking over aim. If you have no confidence and really want to ask him out, then IM should be your last resort. Even over the phone is better.;
, It might be really awkward if you have never messaged with him and you ask him out over Instant Messenger.
 If it seems like he doesn't like chatting with you, you may not want to ask him out. However, if he is giving clues that maybe he likes you, you may consider asking him out.
 That way if you get a negative or weird reaction, you know not to ask him out at that time. Say something like "You're really nice" to see exactly how he responds. If you get anything like "Um" or "Uh thanks." then you might not want to ask him out. If you get a bad reaction say "brb" or "g2g" and leave him alone for a while.
 then that's a good sign. Go for it. Say "wanna go out with me?" or "would you like to go out with me?"

, if they say yes, say "can you ask out for me?". The only thing that can backfire with this trick is that you must make sure that the person is someone that you can trust.
 Tell him you have to go or say "brb" and leave him alone for a while.
 Then set the when and where!

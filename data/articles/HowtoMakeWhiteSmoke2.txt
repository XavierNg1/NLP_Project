 You will need 40 g of ammonium nitrate. You can buy this online, or you can buy a cold pack and cut it open. Gather newspaper, water, and a metal bucket or pan of any size. You will also need rubber gloves.If using a cold pack, make sure to get one that contains pure ammonium nitrate rather than a substitute material such as urea.
 If using purchased ammonium nitrate powder, pour it into the pan. If you are getting your ammonium nitrate from a cold pack, cut open carefully at one end. Discard the packet of water, and remove the packet of ammonium nitrate. Pour the granules into your bucket or large pan.If the water pack breaks, you will use up the chemical properties of your ammonium nitrate.
Gloves should protect your skin from ammonium nitrate's toxicity. If you do get any on your skin, halt your experiment and wash your skin thoroughly with water.
 Watch them dissolve. Don't add extra water unless they aren't dissolving, as you want the mixture to be as concentrated as possible., Take a sheet and dip it into the solution for half a minute so it absorbs the liquid. Remove it gently and lay it out to dry.Soak individual sheets until all the solution is absorbed.
Drying may take several hours.
 Once your newspaper is dry, twist it and roll it up into a roll. The tighter, the better. Secure it with tape or string. This is your smoke bomb.You can make several small smoke bombs with individual sheets of paper, or one large smoke bomb that will last longer.
 Pick a parking lot, gravel lot, or large driveway. Bring a bucket of plain water with you to douse any potential fires. Light one edge of your smoke bomb, and step back several feet immediately.The flame should burn slowly and should not be visible through the smoke.
Douse in water when you are finished.

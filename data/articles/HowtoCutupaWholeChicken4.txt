 This spot is along the ribs where the white breast meat swells out from the body.
 Do not cut from front to back, as doing so will give you a less secure grip on the meat, which could result in sloppy cuts or even cutting yourself. When you have cut the breast from the back, you will have a whole breast cut and the back section in two pieces.









You can also cut along the breastbone, again starting at the back of the bird. Cut through the wishbone when you get to it. Angle the knife and cut down towards the wing, running the knife along the wishbone. Make a cut between the breast and the wing.Another option is to pop out the keel bone by bending the breast halves backwards. Remove the keel bone and cut the breast into halves through the wishbone.
 Pressing hard, push the center down into the cutting board with the flat of your hand. This motion is to help separate the breast bone.
 Run your knife through the center of the breast, down along the bone.
 If you want boneless breast meat, cut the bone away on either side and lift it out. You may need to break the cartilage to achieve removing the breast bone.









If you want to keep the bone in the meat, split the bone with your knife and holding both sides, break the bone apart.

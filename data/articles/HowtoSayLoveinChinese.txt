 If you already speak Chinese, then it shouldn't be too hard to pronounce the phrase correctly. Wo is the third tone, ai is the fourth tone, and ni is of the third tone. Tones represent how the word is spoken and are very important; if the tone is wrong, what you say can become a completely different word! It's like homophones, except with an extremely subtle difference.;
, Imagine a rollercoaster ride and you're going down a dip, then coming back up again. That's how wo should be pronounced, going down, then up.
 It should be somewhat sharp, but don't cut it too short; remember the tone needs to be clear so we know which word you're saying.
, Wo is I, ai is love and ni is you. You can look up sound clips on the internet if you're unsure of your pronunciation, and be sure to practice it until it flows comfortably from you. You don't want to sound jerky and amateurish when you say it, or it'll lose its special exoticness. It's a special phrase, so learn it well before you use it!

 Take the three middle fingers of your left hand and put them on top of the cat’s head. Rest these fingers gently on the cat’s head. Apply light pressure with the fingers., After you place your left middle three fingers on the cat’s head, place your left thumb and little finger directly under the cat’s ear. Then place your right thumb and little finger under the cat’s other ear., Once you have positioned your fingers on the top of the cat’s head and under each ear, apply firm pressure with your fingers. The pressure will help the cat relax, aiding your efforts to immobilize it., Scruffing replicates a mother cat picking up a kitten by grasping the skin on the back of a cat’s neck. This can immobilize a cat, but should only be used in certain circumstances and after other methods fail. For example, you can scruff a cat to trim its nail, administer medications, or to administer minor first aid.Never scruff a cat if you suspect a spinal injury.
Always make sure you support the cat’s weight with your other hand when you scruff a cat.

 In a peer pressure situation, emotions can get out of hand and make you say or do things you don't mean. Pausing for a moment will help you avoid a hasty response and better understand yourself in the moment.You might want to ask yourself, "What kind of person do I want to be? Would that person do this?" If the answer is no, it's likely you should not participate.
 People often get caught up in group mentality, but by expressing your personal feelings, you can connect with your friends/other players. This brings things from a group context to a personal one, making it easier for your friends to identify with you.You could say, "I love hanging out with you guys and I don't want to be a stick in the mud, but I really don't feel comfortable playing this game."

, Though honesty is almost always the best policy, if your friends/other players are determined to get you to play, an excuse can come in handy. This doesn't have to be a big fib, you could say something as simple as:"My throat's been a little sore lately and I don't want to get anyone sick."
"I'm really embarrassed, but I have a canker sore that's been bothering me so I can't play."

, There are plenty of group games you could play instead, and some of the other players might want to play these even more than 7 Minutes in Heaven. Some examples include Twister, charades, pictionary, UNO, and more.You may want to favor games that you know others in the group enjoy. You stand a better chance of playing a different game if others want to play.

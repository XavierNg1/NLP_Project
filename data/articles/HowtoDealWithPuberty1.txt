 When you go through puberty, you will probably notice that you start to sweat more (especially on your armpits) and have more body odor. This is completely normal, but it does mean that you need to be more conscientious about your personal hygiene. Remember to shower every day and wear clean clothes. Applying deodorant every morning will also help you smell fresh and clean.Some deodorants contain antiperspirants, which also prevent sweating. A regular deodorant without an antiperspirant will not prevent sweating, but will prevent odor.
Your hair may become more oily as well, so you may have to wash it more often than you used to.;
, During puberty, you skin will start changing due to hormonal changes, and this may cause you to get acne. You may also notice that your skin is becoming dry or oily. To combat these issues, be sure to wash your face twice a day with a gentle cleanser. Applying an over-the-counter acne cream can help you deal with breakouts, and moisturizing can help you deal with dry skin.Acne medications that contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid as active ingredients tend to be very effective. Everyone's skin is different, so try a few different products until you find one that works for you.
Be aware that acne medications may dry your skin out, so you may need to apply a moisturizer as well.
Always use an oil-free moisturizer on your face, especially if you have acne. Oily moisturizers can cause more breakouts. Moisturizers that contain sunscreen will help protect you from sun damage as well.
Popping pimples and picking at your skin can make your acne problem worse, so avoid doing this.
Try to avoid touching your face or letting your hair come in contact with your face, as this can transfer oil to your skin and cause breakouts.
If you have serious acne that does not get better with over-the-counter treatments, consider seeing a dermatologist.

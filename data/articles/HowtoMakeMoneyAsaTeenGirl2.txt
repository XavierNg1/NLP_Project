 If you are a strong swimmer, you can become a certified lifeguard and work at a pool, water park or beach. In order to get your certification, you can find your local Red Cross center, and take a lifeguard training class. Here are some of the requirements to become a lifeguard:Be at least 15 years of ageBe able to tread water for two minutesBe able to dive to a depth of seven to ten feet, Busy families who don't have enough time for yard work are always eager to hire helping hands. If you like spending time outdoors, and are up for manual labor, make some flyers, and put them out around your neighborhood. Only advertise for outside work that you feel comfortable doing. Consider doing the following:


Try planting flowers in the spring.
Try mowing lawns in the summer.
Try raking leaves in the fall.
Try shoveling snow from your neighbors' sidewalks and driveways in the winter.
 Make a poster that says, "Carwash!", and include the price you will charge. Stand near a street that gets decent traffic, and wait for cars to come to you. You can have the cars pull into your driveway, and wash the cars there. If you have a vacuum, offer car detailing to make even more money.

 Wash your produce and shred 1 head of green cabbage. Transfer the shredded cabbage into a large serving bowl along with 1 1/2 cups (75 g) of julienned carrots, 4 scallions (green onions) that have been sliced and 1/2 of a thinly sliced red onion. Toss the cole slaw mix until the vegetables are combined.To julienne the carrots, use a knife to slice the carrots into very thin strips. You could also use a julienne attachment on a mandolin.
 Measure out and pour Â¼ cup (60 ml) of apple cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, and 1 tablespoon of sugar or agave nectar in a small mixing bowl. Use a small whisk or fork to combine the tangy dressing ingredients.Taste the dressing and add salt and pepper according to your taste.
 Immediately pour the tangy dressing over the cole slaw mix and use salad forks or tongs to combine the coleslaw. If you wait to pour the dressing over the mix, the oil may separate. You can serve the tangy cole slaw right away or let the flavors develop for at least 30 minutes before you serve it.This tangy vegan cole slaw is a great choice for picnics or outdoor events where you won't have access to a refrigerator.

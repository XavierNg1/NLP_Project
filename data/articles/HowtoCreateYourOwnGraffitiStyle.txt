 Don't just get your favorite colors; get your least favorite ones, too. Everything can have a purpose in art, and that's what graffiti is. When you are first learning the basics, look up pictures of graffiti on the Internet and try to duplicate them with pencil and paper. This improves hand-eye coordination as well as ads to your "muscle memory" of basic graffiti shapes. However, this should only be used for practice when you're mastering the basics of graffiti. Once you've got those down, you should move on to developing your own unique style.);
, When you start trying to draw graffiti it will help you form your own style.
 Use a good eraser to remove anything that doesn't quite work and then redraw and refine your design. Keeping it simple at this stage will help you in the next step.
 Try to keep one style per word or sentence, as mixing up styles can get distracting.
 Try different shapes and variations on ornaments and decorative elements. When you are done perfecting your word, use a black or blue pen or Sharpie to go over the basic letters and color in with highlighters, Sharpies, crayons and colored pencils. Try not to get too extravagant yet, just do what you really want to do.
 If you don't like your style now, start over—maybe even by tracing or redrawing the parts you do like form the old design and using that as a starting point. Keep trying and work hard to get what you want out of your art. Practice makes perfect, they say, and perfection can't be rushed. So have patience—and have fun!

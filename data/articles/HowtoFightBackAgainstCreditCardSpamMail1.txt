 OptOutPrescreen.com is a website run by the four major US credit reporting agencies, Equifax, Experian, Innovis, and TransUnion. Collectively, you have them to thank for all of the annoying “pre-screened offers” that have been wearing out your mailbox.That’s right. Up until now, the credit reporting agencies have been gleefully peddling your data to any loan shark willing to cough up a few bucks.;
, It will take you to the opt-out page. Once on the opt-out page, you’ll have three choices to select at the bottom. Select the one in the middle. It should say “Electronic Opt-Out for Five Years.” Hit the button that says “submit” at the bottom of the screen.If you want to opt out forever, make the selection all the way at the bottom that says “Permanent Opt-Out By Mail.”
OptOutPrescreen.com notifies you at the top of the page that they’re going to ask for some very sensitive personal information: Social Security number, date of birth, name, and address. In addition, they are uncharacteristically up-front about it. Since the credit reporting agencies already have all of that information, it seems like it might be a ruse to scare away the private.
 After you clicked “submit” on the last page, it should have taken you to a form where you can enter your information for them to remove you from their lists.Though they will ask, you aren’t required to provide your date of birth or Social Security number.
Once you’re done, click “Confirm.” You’re all set. It might take a few weeks to be purged from their system completely , but now you’re on your way to a clean mailbox once more. At least for the next five years.
 If you want to opt out forever, you'll need to print out the form on the next page. Sign, date, and complete it. Address it to the indicated address, and put it in the mail.

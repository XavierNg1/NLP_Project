 Don’t try to rely on your memory! You will be able to refer back to those notes later when you get stuck on a homework problem or while studying for a test. You can also highlight any parts that you might need to discuss with a tutor. , Come to class having already read the material that will be covered. This will give you an opportunity to ask more effective questions, and go back over anything you didn't understand while you were reading through it. But, you don't necessarily need to understand it all during the first read-through.
 Even if you don’t understand everything that is covered, you’ll be able to take notes and ask questions, and it’ll make more sense when you go back over it later. You will learn more by being present than you will by trying to catch up later. Engineering is a language of its own; the more time you spend listening to it, the easier it will be to understand it over time.
 Don’t wait until just before a test to begin studying. Engineering classes build progressively, and tests tend to cover both old and new material -- if you don’t understand something, address it immediately and work to fully understand it before moving on. This way, the days before a test can be spent going back over the things you need the most help with.

 Another commonly practiced method for cleaning a rescued kitten is using a comb or brush. Sometimes this method is inappropriate for rescued kittens as they are too dirty and soiled. However, if your kitten isn't very dirty and there doesn't seem to be any contamination to the fur, you can easily clean her by brushing.


Brushing is very helpful to remove fleas (if there are any) in wild rescued kittens. It also helps to stimulate subcutaneous blood circulation and may improve the condition of her skin.
 Take a careful look at the skin and fur of your orphaned kitten to detect the presence of fleas before selecting the right brush for your kitten. The brush or comb usually differs from kitten to kitten based on the length and pattern of her coat.


You can purchase specially designed metal combs from most pet shops. Please consult with your local vet if you are confused about which brush to select for your kitten.
 Cats naturally groom themselves and can take offense when you try to help them. They may also not know what's going on and become especially curious. When you brush her and she begins biting at the brush, simply place one in front of her so she can smell it and use the second brush to keep brushing. This gives the kitten a chance to see the brush while continually being groomed. She will eventually learn that brushing feels good and allow you to groom her freely


Whenever she grabs the brush you are using, just pick up the other one and continue brushing.
 Reverse direction of brushing can cause unnecessary irritation and hair loss for your kitten. You can brush her whole body thoroughly including the abdomen, back and hind quarters.


Some kittens may show resistance during brushing. Be gentle and use a calm, soothing voice when you're grooming her to calm her.
Make sure to clean your brush periodically during the process as dirt and hair may clump on it and make it less effective.

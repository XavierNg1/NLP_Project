 The scrum-half is generally the fastest player on the team. They are responsible for getting the ball out of the scrum once it has reached the back of it and also putting the ball in once a scrum has been called.
, During kick-offs, they usually receive the ball and they do most of the scoring.
 The centres are involved in most of the back line passing and are also very fast.
 The full back is behind the defense and near the back of the field. They are usually the ones who catch the ball when the other teamâ€™s fly-half has kicked it during play.

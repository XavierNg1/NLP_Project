 The earlier that you and your toddler wake up, the more time you have to get out of the house during the day. Make sure to put your toddler to sleep early. Set your alarm an hour earlier if you've had trouble getting to appointments on time in the past., Creating a schedule for how long everything takes when you're trying to leave the house will help you gauge if you are running behind or ahead of schedule. If you have a daily routine, then most of the things that you do every day will remain the same.


Use a stopwatch or clock to get an estimate of how long tasks like waking up, getting dressed, and eating breakfast take for you and your toddler.
 When you schedule how long it takes to get your toddler out of the door, make sure to allocate additional time if something goes wrong. Delays can be caused by a toddler who's in a bad mood or having to clean up a spill or mess. Allowing yourself a buffer time will help relax you and get out of the door faster., If there is more than one parent in the house, you can create a gameplan with the other parent to help your toddler so that you can get ready faster. For example, parents can switch off on who gets ready and who takes care of the toddler in increments, so that everyone has time to get ready in the morning., Instead of bathing your toddler in the morning or when you wake up, bathe your toddler the night before. Warm water will also relax your toddler and make them sleepy, so this may be something you want to do towards the night. Bathing your toddler the day before will save you time and can help you get out of the door faster.Never leave your toddler unattended in the bath.
 Toddlers can be distracted easily, so avoid providing your toddler with a toy or the TV unless they are ready to leave. Once they are dressed and fed, however, a toy can serve as a reward for getting out of the house. Distractions can also delay how long it takes you to complete tasks, so keep them to a minimum for yourself as well.

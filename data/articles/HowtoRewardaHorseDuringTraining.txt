, Anything such as "good boy/girl!" works.


If the horse will be used for showing though, don't only reward them with a pat on the neck- because in the show ring you most likely won't be able to touch your horse, and your horse may stop behaving if you don't reward them.
, Relaxation is the best thing for both you and your horse, and if either being is stressed, the other will just feed off of that, and it will continue to worsen.


Example: If they are cantering around you, allow them to stop and come into you for a treat.
 How you do this is by asking them what you want, and then the split second they start doing it, release the pressure. From a horse's perspective, why should they do what this human wants us to do when we won't gain anything from it? Using the pressure-release method will reinforce good training, and will also let the horse know when he's doing something right.


Let's say you're trying to get their head lowered so they'll be more collected. What do you do? Pull in the reins a bit (the amount depending on how sensitive their mouth is and the severity of the bit), and then as soon as their head goes down even half an inch- release the pressure. A horse is sensitive about the bit pressure and will feel the release, making it more willing to work and let him know he's doing the correct thing.

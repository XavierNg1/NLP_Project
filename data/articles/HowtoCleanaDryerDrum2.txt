 Before you start, you should unplug the dryer to prevent accidents. The plug is usually located behind the machine. Test it to be sure that you have unplugged it correctly.
 Using a spatula or an old credit card, scrape any large pieces of crayon that may be left off of the dryer drum.
 Get an old rag and spray it with WD-40.You should be very sure not to spray the drum itself with the WD-40, just the rag.
 Use the rag to wipe at the spots covered in crayon. Try not to cover any more area with the WD-40 than you have to. This should allow you to remove all of the crayon without too much difficulty.


Switch which part of the rag you wipe with frequently to keep from spreading the crayon any more.
 Once you've removed all of the crayon, or at least as much as you can, you'll want to mix up a bucket with soapy water and use a sponge or washcloth to clean the WD-40 out of the drum. Pay extra attention to the spots with the WD-40.
 With the dryer rinsed out, run a load of old towels through a cycle in the dryer to remove any crayon which might still remain.

 For the creamy morel sauce, you’ll need 2 cups (150 g) of fresh morel mushrooms. Rinse them under cold water, and use a knife to cut any large mushrooms in half.It’s best to cut the morels in half lengthwise.
 Add 1 tablespoon (14 g) of butter to a medium saucepan. Heat it on medium until it melts, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.If you prefer, you can substitute olive oil for the butter.
 Once the butter is melted, add a large minced shallot to the pan. Allow it to cook on medium until it becomes translucent, which should take approximately 1 minute.If you don’t have a shallot, you can substitute a sweet onion, such as Vidalia.
 When the shallot has cooked long enough to become translucent, add the morels. Next, stir in some salt and freshly ground black pepper to season the mixture., After you’ve seasoned the mixture, mix in 1 cup (237 ml) of chicken stock. Raise the heat to high, and allow the mixture to come to a full boil, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.You can substitute vegetable stock for the chicken stock if you prefer.
 When you’ve brought the mixture to a boil, continue boiling it on high heat. Allow the mixture to reduce by half, which should take approximately 6 minutes., Once the mixture has reduced, add 1 cup (237 ml) of heavy cream and ½ teaspoon (½ g) of finely chopped, fresh thyme. Turn the heat down to medium high, and simmer the sauce until it reduces by a third, which should take approximately 5 minutes.You can substitute sage, savory, or marjoram for the thyme if you prefer.
 When the sauce has thickened, mix in some more salt and black pepper to taste. Next, stir in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of fresh lemon juice, and serve immediately.The creamy morel sauce makes a delicious pasta sauce or a topping for roast chicken, veal, or fish. You can even ladle some over mashed potatoes or toasted bread.

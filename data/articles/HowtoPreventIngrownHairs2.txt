 If shaving is your preferred method of hair removal, keeping your hair and skin moisturized during the shave is a must. Using a cream or gel will make the hair easier to cut, and will prevent skin irritation.


For best results, apply your shaving gel or cream a few minutes before you start shaving.It’s a good idea to shave in the shower or immediately after getting out of the shower. The warm water will soften the hair, making shaving much easier.
 Shaving “with the grain” may help reduce friction and prevent damage and irritation to your skin. However, this technique doesn’t work for everyone. Experiment with the shaving direction that is most effective and least irritating for you., A sharp blade will cut your hair more easily and is less likely to irritate your skin. If your razor is getting dull, replace it with a new one. While some experts recommend using a single blade razor, it is unclear whether this really helps prevent the development of ingrown hairs. Stick with your multi-blade razor if you find that it is less irritating and more effective for you., Razors quickly become clogged with shaving gel and hair during the shaving process, which reduces their effectiveness and makes irritation more likely. Rinse your razor between strokes to prevent buildup and keep it shaving smoothly., Electric razors and clippers don’t cut as close to the skin as traditional safety razors, which can reduce your chance of developing ingrown hairs. It may be worthwhile to sacrifice a super close shave if you shave frequently and regularly develop ingrown hairs.Avoid setting your razor/clippers on the closest shave setting, and hold the blade slightly away from your skin while shaving.

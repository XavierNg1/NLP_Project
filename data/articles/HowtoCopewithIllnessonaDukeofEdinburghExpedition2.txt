 Thinking about your illness will often add to your anxiety and make you feel worse. The constant walking is a good distraction in itself and talking, singing and joking with your friends can take your mind off how you're feeling and keep your spirits high.
 Think about all the effort you've put in to get this far and how much it means to you to complete the award. Keep yourself motivated with snacks and possibly group sing-a-longs.
 This way, your supervisor will know to keep an eye on you and will be prepared if you take a turn for the worse. Your friends will be more sympathetic and slow the pace down if they know you're unwell.
 Don't add to your illness. Keep hydrated and make sure you're eating enough (about 3000-5000kcals a day). Wear a sun hat and plenty of sun cream if it's sunny. Do this in order to avoid sunstroke. Also, keep warm and dry if it's cold, make sure you bring plenty of layers and an effective sleeping bag and sleeping mat.


If you're feeling nauseous you may not feel like eating or drinking much, but dehydration and exhaustion will only make you feel worse.
 Sleep deprivation will seriously drain your energy supplies and it would make the expedition nearly impossible, even without being ill too.


Listening to relaxing music can help you drift off to sleep. It also helps to block out any noise from outside.
 If you feel seriously ill or feel like you might collapse or pass out, stop! Let someone know what's wrong, take your rucksack off and sit down. Have someone call your supervisor and let them know what's going on. If you can continue after a short break, that's great, but if not, call the supervisor to come and pick you up.

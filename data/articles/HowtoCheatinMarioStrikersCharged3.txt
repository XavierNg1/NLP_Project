 Charging the ball has no effect on the outcome of this move. When you get close enough, the goalie will attempt to lunge at or hit you in an effort to take the ball.
 You have a tiny window of opportunity to score just after doing this because (with good timing) you will have passed right through the goalie. If you wait more than a split second to shoot, the goalie will recover and take the ball.
 Chipping makes it harder for the goalie to take, but if done at an odd angle (such as from the side) it won't work since chips are not guided automatically towards the goal like shots are. This move is used frequently on Wi-Fi as well. It is best to just let the goalie handle it, he can stop it sometimes. Or you may have a player just behind the goalie hit the Boo passing through him, thus stopping the ball. (If done from a bad angle, you may actually end up knocking the ball into your own goal!)

 After you've found your breeder, schedule a time where you can see their newest or upcoming litter.
 Ask the breeder which puppy would be likely to do the best in herding, breeding, showing, etc. Breeders will always try to help you find the best puppy, as they are committed to making their breed the best as possible.
 Make sure your puppy is healthy, strong, playful, and a little curious. Never get a sick puppy. Signs of a sick puppy are:


Discharge coming out of the nose, or eyes.
Stinky/Waxy/Red ears
Signs of diarrhea
Weak limbs

, Bring your puppy home. You should preferably pick the puppy up at the breeder's, even if it is a long drive. This will save the puppy the stress of shipping on a plane, which causes trauma, and sometimes even death.

 Some graduates pump their fists while they’re on stage or grab the diploma without shaking the presenter’s hand.Being on stage is certainly a proud moment, and it’s the conclusion to years of hard work. However, this type of celebrating is disrespectful, distracts from other graduates, and takes away from the prestige of the graduation ceremony. There will be plenty of time to jump for joy later.


Remember, the title of the song played at many graduations is “Pomp and Circumstance,” which implies that the ceremony involves dignity, formality, and tradition., Before and after receiving your diploma, allow your friends and fellow students to have their own proud moments. Don’t be a distraction, and don’t applaud or shout out to your friends when they cross the stage. The person who announces the names of the graduates will most likely direct the audience to withhold applause until the end, so you should respectfully follow suit.
 Some graduation ceremonies include hat-throwing or drop confetti. That’s when you can scream, shout, and jump for joy. Be proud of yourself and your accomplishments, and breathe a big sigh of relief.


If you don't want to have to search for your cap after tossing it, you can always just wave your cap in the air.
Keep your diploma on hand after the ceremony to take photos with your friends and family.
While you're celebrating, make sure to keep your diploma in good condition, especially if you receive the actual copy at the ceremony. Don't lose it, and keep it safe so you can proudly display it in a prominent place when you get home.

 A small salt or pepper shaker is the ideal kind of container to store your dry shampoo, but you could even use a cheese shaker.;
, Unscrew and remove the cap from the container. Use warm soapy water to wash away any impurities before you fill it with the dry shampoo ingredients.


After washing, lay the container upside down on a paper towel to allow it to completely dry.
 Once the container is completely dried, use a funnel to add ¼ cup of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of baking soda into the container.Remove the funnel, and use your hand to cover the container opening. Keeping your hand tightly secured to the container opening, gently shake the container and its contents for about 5 seconds.


Shaking the container like this allows you to thoroughly mix the cornstarch and baking soda together.
You can substitute arrowroot powder for the cornstarch; they both have oil absorbing properties.
 Snap or screw on the lid of the container. Make sure that the lid is fastened firmly, with no openings or uneven attachments.


If the lid isn’t attached tightly, you run the risk of spilling all the dry shampoo on your head when you try to sprinkle it on.

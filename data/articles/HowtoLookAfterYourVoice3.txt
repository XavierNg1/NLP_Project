 Dry environments or dusty air can cause the mucous membranes in your throat to dry out. Over time, this can result in changes to your voice. If you are spending time in a dry environment, or one with central heating or air conditioning, you may want to purchase a humidifier.

The recommended amount of humidity in the air you breathe is 30%.
In the winter time, and in climates that are dry in general, humidifiers are very important for keeping your vocal cords lubricated and moist.Another way to hydrate and soothe dry, irritated vocal cords is by inhaling steam. Fill up a large bowl or kettle with boiled water, and add some chamomile flowers if you’d like. Then, sit with your face over the bowl—if the water is too hot, let it cool for a few minutes first. Cover your head and shoulders with a towel, and breathe in and out through your mouth. After inhaling the steam, avoid talking for about thirty minutes. This will let the newly hydrated mucous membranes rest., People often speak louder than they realize due to excessive background noise. To avoid shouting that can damage your voice, consider moving your conversation to a quieter location if you plan to talk a lot. If you are at home, turn off the TV or music while talking so that you can speak more softly and still be heard., Air-fresheners, hairspray, and perfume all release chemicals into the air. When you breathe these in, they can dry out and irritate your vocal cords. Try limiting your use of these products, or use them in a very well-ventilated area.

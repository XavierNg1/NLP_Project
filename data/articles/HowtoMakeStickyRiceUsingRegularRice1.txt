 There is no real substitute for sticky rice; it is a type of rice (like brown rice) and not a dish (like fried rice). The flavor and texture of these recipes will be different because you are using regular rice. Also, be aware that even if you cook regular rice so that it becomes mushier or stickier, it still may not be sticky enough for nigiri-style sushi., Are you looking to make sticky rice out of regular rice because you cannot find it in a store? If you can't find sticky rice anywhere, try searching for "sweet rice," or "glutinous rice." They are the same thing.Try using another short-grain rice or risotto rice. Both will have a stickier texture once cooked (compared to medium and long-grained rice).Short-grain rice is stickier than other types of rice once cooked because it has more starch in it.

 Partition or decompose the number into its separate place value pieces: ones, tens, hundreds, and so on. Write it out in extended form.



Example: Find the double of 453.

When broken apart into separate place values: 453 = 400 + 50 + 3



, Look at each partitioned portion and double it while separated.


To double values larger than those in the ones place position, double the non-zero digit, then follow that calculated value with the same number of zeroes.

Example: You will need to double 400, 50, and 3 separately.

Since the double of 4 is 8, the double of 400 is 800.
Since the double of 5 is 10, the double of 50 is 100.
The double of 3 is 6.
 Add the doubled values together to write the answer in its standard form.



Example: 800 + 100 + 6 = 906

, The answer you found by adding the doubled values together should be the doubled value of your original number, and your final answer.



Example: The double of 453 is 906.

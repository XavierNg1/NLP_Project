 Boil about one medium sized packet. Check your package directions to see how long to cook it.;
, Shake it off well to have no excess water.
 Mix using your hands or a spoon.
 Mix until the vibrant color of the 'worms' appear.
 Place it out where you don't mind messes (examples could be a garage, an old room, the backyard, etc).


If you are doing this activity in a place were you do mind messes, spread an old tablecloth or blanket on the floor. This will prevent an oily colorful mess on your carpet or floor.
 Bowls, funnels, a pair of tongs, spoons, and/or measuring cups are good choices of tools to play with the spaghetti.
 If you and/or your kids want to avoid getting food coloring stains on your hands, wear plastic gloves before starting to play.


Do note that if you do wear gloves, you won't be able to feel the 'sliminess' between your fingers.
 Feel that spaghetti between your fingers. Use some of your tools to make this activity more fun than ever!

, After all the enjoyment, it's time to clean up. Place the spaghetti in a container for another play date. If you were wearing gloves, remove them and wash your hands. If you didn't wear gloves, wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap.


This pasta can last for about a month, as long as you pour oil and fresh food coloring when it's time to play again.

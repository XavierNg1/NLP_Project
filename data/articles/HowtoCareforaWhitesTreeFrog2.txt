 You can measure humidity by using a hygrometer. In the wild, these animals live in moist forested environments and are usually found close to sources of water, so they prefer a humid habitat.Keep humidity levels low by making sure the tank stays dry and has a fully exposed mesh lid.Keep humidity levels high by misting the tank, keeping the substrate damp, or covering 2/3 of the mesh lid with plastic., There should be no sudden rises or drops in tank temperature. Instead, maintain a comfortable average of 75-85°F (23.9-29.4°C) during the day and 65°F (18.3°C) at night., To regulate moisture levels, it helps to lightly mist the tank with water once a day.


Don’t mist too much - a soggy tank will be unsuitable for a White’s tree frog., Place your frog in a secure location, then scrub the tank, rinse it with hot water, allow it to dry, and install fresh substrate.

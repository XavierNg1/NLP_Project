 If you're avoiding eggs for dietary reasons — and not just because your fridge is understocked — check the brownie mix ingredients first. Some brownie mixes contain whey or other dairy products not suitable for vegans. Less commonly, some brands include egg whites.
 The easiest option is to follow the recipe printed on the box. For each egg in the recipe, replace it with one of the following:


1 tbsp (15 mL) finely ground flax seeds, mixed into 3 tbsp (45 mL) water and allowed to thicken for five minutes.¼ cup (60 mL) plain nonfat yogurt (or soy yogurt for a vegan recipe)An egg replacement product, available at health food stores

, Eggs are complex ingredients. While most egg substitutes can replace the moisture and the ability to hold the batter together, they do not form the same foaming structure that eggs do. Try adding ½ tsp (2.5 mL) baking powder to the mix to create a slightly airier batter and avoid a dense, collapsed brownie.


This is a ballpark figure, since brownie mixes come in many different recipes. You may need to experiment with adding more.
 If you don't want to worry about all these egg substitutes, you can skip the recipe on the box and go with a two-ingredient recipe instead. Here are a couple options which may sound strange, but which end up working pretty well:


Open a can of black beans (~15 oz). Drain and rinse well to reduce salt, fill can with water, and blend until you don't see any bean skins. Mix with a box of brownie mix (~20 oz) and bake on a greased pan until a toothpick comes out mostly clean.Combine a can of pumpkin puree (~15 oz) with a box of brownie mix (~20 oz). Bake for about 25–30 minutes or according to package instructions.

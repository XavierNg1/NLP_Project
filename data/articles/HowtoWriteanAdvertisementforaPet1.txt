 Don't underestimate the importance of a good title, especially when posting an ad online. The most important thing to remember is to keep it short, detailed, and attention-grabbing.


Instead of just writing "Buddy needs a home", include basic information (type of animal, for example);
, People respond positively to well written messages; they respond negatively to things that are badly written or that carry negative connotations. For example:



A less impressive title: VERY FRIENDLY LABRADOR 4 SALE CHEAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In this case, the capital letters create the impression that the advertiser is "screaming" at you, which seems a little unprofessional. While it also suggests that the Labrador is very friendly, the misspelling of the dog's breed and the excessive exclamation points suggest immaturity and maybe even irresponsibility, which can lead to the potential buyer wondering if the dog has been well cared for. Moreover, adding the word "cheap" automatically diminishes the worth of the pet, which is most certainly not the message you're looking to get across.



A positive and welcoming title: Friendly, Beautiful Guinea Pig for Sale!

In this second instance, the overall impression of the advertiser is that he or she is sensible and intelligent enough to spell correctly and restrained enough to take good care of a pet. The title catches your attention, but doesnâ€™t create the desperateness that the first title suggests.




While neither impression may be accurate, impressions do matter and when there is so little to go on, it pays to get it right immediately.

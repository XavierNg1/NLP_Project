 You should have 3 people in your boating party: you, a driver and a spotter.;
, Place your feet on your wakeboard on land and have your spotter pull you. The foot that automatically goes forward on land will be the foot that should go forward in the water.
 The wakeboard will float in front of you, and you want it to be perpendicular to the water.
 Keep your arms straight as the boat accelerates slowly and pulls you up.
 Keep your knees at your chest and your arms straight; let the boat do the pulling for you.
 Stand up slowly, as though you are coming up out of a squat.
 Place your weight over your back foot and "carve" against the water to maintain balance. Keep your knees bent and your arms straight. Your shoulders and hips should be aligned with the board, not with the boat.
 Remember to keep the handle of the rope on the same side as your hip that's facing the boat. Position your hips over your front foot and your shoulders over your back foot.
 Make sure that:


Your feet are in a sideways stance to the boat.
Your shoulders and hips are lined up with the board and are not facing the boat.
The rope handle is down and your arms are straight.
Your knees are bent, and your head is facing up.

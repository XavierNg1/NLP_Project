If you, say, tuck in your shirt with your jeans, you can also pair it with a longer jacket or blazer. This will draw attention to your legs and shoes. When layering, opt for a shorter shirt paired with a longer cardigan, blazer, or jacket., Most types of shoes work well with cropped jeans. For a more casual outing, things like flats, sandals, and mules look great with cropped jeans.You can also simply wear cropped jeans with sneakers.

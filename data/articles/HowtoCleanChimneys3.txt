Assemble the brush and one section of pipe.
Attach the first piece of pipe to the brush.
Insert the brush into the chimney through the fireplace. Using up and down motions, begin to scrub the flue clean.
Add another section of pipe to enable you to extend the brush further up the chimney. #*Continue in this fashion until you've cleaned the length of the flue.



Buy a pulley rope system to be used with your chimney brush. Two ropes are attached to the brush, one on the top and one on the bottom, and the brush is operated from both the roof and the fireplace.
Assemble the pulley system with the brush. Have one person take it up a ladder to the roof.
The person on the roof should hold one side of the rope, and drop the other side, with the brush in the middle, through the flue to the other person waiting below.
Working together, use the ropes to pull the brush up and down, scrubbing the entire chimney flue.

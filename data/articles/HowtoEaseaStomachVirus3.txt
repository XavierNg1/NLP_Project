The following symptoms should be evaluated by a medical professional:Diarrhea, vomiting, or severe abdominal pain that lasts longer than 48 hours
Blood in your stool
Confusion or dizziness
No urination for an 8 hour period
Sunken appearance in the eyes
With infants, watch for a lack of tears when crying, less drool than usual for a teething infant, a lack of urination for 4 hours, or a sunken soft spot on the infant's head. This can be a sign of severe dehydration.
 The stomach virus can spread easily. You should not return to work or school for at least 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared up. If you have a young child, make sure not to send him or her to school for at least 48 hours as the stomach virus often spreads quickly in a classroom setting., As the stomach virus can take time away from work and school obligations, take steps to prevent a reoccurrence of the virus. If you know someone at work or school is currently infected with the virus, take extra steps to protect yourself.Wash your hands frequently throughout the day.

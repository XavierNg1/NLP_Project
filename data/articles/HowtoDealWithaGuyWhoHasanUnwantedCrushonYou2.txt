 Tell him it’s not something you do. Workplace relationships are always a bad idea. What may seem fun at first can turn into something terrible if you break up. Let him know that workplace relationships are not something you engage in.


Simply tell him, “Nothing personal, but I don’t date people I work with.” If he persists, tell him again that you don’t date co-workers. Then, leave it at that., Let him know that getting into a relationship outside of work could jeopardize your careers. This is particularly the case when there are rules at your job against dating co-workers. Let him know clearly that you can’t go out on a date because it could mess up a career or job that you’ve worked hard for and that you need.


You could say to him, “I appreciate your honesty, but I prefer to keep things between us professional. I don’t want to cross the line and jeopardize our work, so I’m going to have to say no.”, Avoid telling them why you are declining if it is something you don’t like about them. Instead, put all of the blame on you. This will likely make working with them and seeing them easier.


For instance, go along the lines of, “It’s not you, it’s me.” Let him know you think he’s great, but dating someone you work with just isn’t something you’re interested in., You may be wary of making trouble at your workplace, but you have a right to work in an environment where you don't feel harassed. If the guy keeps bothering you, take the issue to a supervisor.You might say, "Justin keeps pressuring me to go out with him. At first, I didn't think it was a big deal, but it's gotten to a level where I feel uncomfortable working with him. I don't know what to do. Can you help?"

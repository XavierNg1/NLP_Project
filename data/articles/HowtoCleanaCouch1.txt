 Sofas can be made of anything from cotton to leather, and knowing exactly what fabric you’re working with is important for knowing how to clean it. Check the tag on the bottom of your sofa to determine the type of cloth. The tag should give a label of “W,” “S,” “WS,” “X,” or “O.”









A tag with the letter “W” or “WS” means that your couch is washable with a water-based soap.
A tag with the letter “S” means that it needs to be dry cleaned or cleaned with a non-water based detergent.
If your tag says “X,” it implies that the fabric should only be vacuumed or dry-cleaned by a professional.
A tag with the letter “O” means that the cloth is organic and needs to be washed using cold water.;
, This will differ depending on the type of fabric, but should consist of a detergent of some sort, a brush or sponge for scrubbing, a rag, and a vacuum cleaner.
 If the legs, base, or armrest of your couch have any wood or metal on them, wipe them down with soap and water to clean off any dust or grime. Additionally, you can choose to use a wood or metal polish to enhance the shine of these parts.
 Some cushions and pillows have removable covers which you can simply put in the washing machine. They must be set aside though so that the full couch can be washed.
 If your vacuum is equipped, at the upholstery attachment for the best results. It is important to remove as much dirt, hair, dust, and crumbs as possible before you start scrubbing it. Depending on the fabric, this may be the last step you are able to perform without a professional.

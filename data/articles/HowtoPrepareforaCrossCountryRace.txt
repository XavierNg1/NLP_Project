 This may be directed by your school, college or coach. If not, write out a sensible plan for training practice based on what you already know about your stamina and previous race performances.


In general, run at least every other day in the few weeks leading up the race.
If you are working, use lunchtimes to squeeze in brief training runs. Before and after work can be used for longer runs, and the weekend can be used for full-distance runs.;
, If the race is situated away from your home city or state, look up the terrain using Google Maps or read about the place using local websites. Then try to match the terrain with what you have at home.
 These will provide you with the slow-burning energy you'll need to keep going during the race.


Pasta, potatoes, rice, etc. are good sources of complex carbohydrates.
 Don't skimp so much that you feel starving though. Stop eating at least an hour before the race.
 Have plenty of liquids the day before the race and during breakfast. Carry water during the race and be sure there is a ready supply at the end of the race.


You might prefer sports drinks, with electrolytes. Avoid energy drinks––too much sugar and caffeine will cause you to buzz rather than remain focused.
 This includes arms, shoulders, hamstring and calf.
 Take deep breaths and remember that adrenaline will help you in the race.
 Hum a tune or count, to try to keep the beat with your running.

Remote mounted radar detectors are typically more expensive than the traditional units that are mounted on dashboards. These radar detectors are more difficult to detect if you're in a place where they are illegal as the detector unit is usually mounted inside the dashboard. This unit is also not visible to thieves. Remote mounted radar detectors should always be installed by a professional as the unit will need to be placed inside the dash.;

These are the most common of all radar detectors and they can be easily removed from your car. They simply plug into the cigarette lighter of the car and the unit is affixed to the windshield with suction cups. These units are fairly inexpensive and don't require a professional installation.


Both the cordless and corded radar detector require batteries but the difference between them is that cordless models can be plugged directly into the car's fuse box and then any wiring can be hidden by simply tucking it under any molding in the car's interior.

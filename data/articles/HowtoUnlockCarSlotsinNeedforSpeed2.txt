 You can do this using the Windows Start menu (Start button >> All Programs >> EA Games >> Need for Speed World) or by double-clicking the Need for Speed: World shortcut on your desktop, if you have it there.


The cheat only works when the game is running.
 You can do this by pressing Ctrl + Esc together.
 On a new web browser, go to http://rghost.net/50739915.
 This will download a zip (compressed) file named nfsw,slots.rar that contains two files: NFSW_PursuitBot.exe and SlotBot.exe.
 This will extract the two files from the zip file and place them in the folder you are working from.
, This will bring up a dialog box that will allow you to choose how many slots you wish to add to your NFS World garage.
 This will add the number of slots you specified in your garage.


The number of car slots you have represents the maximum number of cars you can buy in NFS World, hence the more the better!

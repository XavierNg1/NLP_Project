 You can use craft paint or even regular paint if you’re stamping on furniture or walls.If you’re working on a larger project, pour some of your paint onto a paper towel. This will act as a big ink pad.
 Tap the sponge onto the stamp repeatedly. Keep doing this until you see an even coat of paint on the stamp. If you’re using paint on a paper towel, dip the stamp into the paint on the paper towel.If you use the paper towel technique, spread some newspaper under the paper towel to prevent any bleed through.
 It’s especially important not to press too hard on your stamp if you’re using paint. If you do, the paint might smoosh out of the sides of the stamp., Don't favor one side of the stamp over the other. This can make one part of your stamped area look really light, while other parts look darker. Instead, place your palm over the center of the stamp and press down evenly.

Also, don’t give him the silent treatment, and hope he gets the point. The polite way to handle the situation is to give him a response.
Even though you want to respond in a timely manner, within the day that he sends the message, take a little time to think about what you want to

,


For example, instead of telling him, “Sorry, you aren’t really my type,” say something more like, “I’m really sorry. I just don’t see you in a romantic way.”
Or say: “I’ve really enjoyed getting to know you, but I don’t see this developing into anything further for me.”

, Even if you normally text or type in a manner that is very casual, try to be a bit more formal in your rejection.


Use complete sentences and words. Instead of typing, “No thx. I’m just not really interested in u like that,” Say, “Thanks for asking, but I just don’t see you that way.”
Add something polite after your rejection. This can help you end the conversation and also soften the blow. Write something like, “Sorry. Wish you the best, John!”

, Often, it is easier to lie over text than it is to lie in person. It can be tempting to come up with excuses to let yourself off the hook, but in the long run, it is always better to lead with the truth.Don’t leave your answer open-ended. Make sure that he won’t think you might be interested in the future. Make your answer final. Even if you do want to be friends, make sure you say, “I don’t see myself having romantic feelings for you, but I’d love to be friends!” instead of “Do you mind if we just stay friends right now?”
Even though you want to be final and firm when you send your message, also try to find something positive to say. For example, say, “I appreciate that you asked me because I’ve enjoyed talking to you, but I just don’t have romantic feelings for you.”

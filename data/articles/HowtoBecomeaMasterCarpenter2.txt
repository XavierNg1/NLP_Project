 This step isn’t a must, so if you’re eager and qualified to begin more direct training in the field, feel free to skip it. However, if you’re unable to begin an apprenticeship right away and a local carpenter or construction crew is hiring helpers, take advantage of it. Use this opportunity to learn what you can by observing journey workers in action while completing other tasks on-site. This is an ideal learning experience if you are:Under the age of 18
Still earning your high school diploma or equivalent
Still waiting to become a U.S. citizen or legal resident

, As with the helper position, obtaining a PACT (Pre-Apprenticeship Certificate Training) certificate isn’t strictly necessary in order to become an apprentice. However, if you have little to no experience with any form of construction, consider the benefits of earning one. These include:Introductions to carpentry as well as painting, plumbing, masonry, landscaping, and other building trades.Lessons on tools, construction materials, math, safety, and first aid.
Certification that qualifies you for entry-level employment in the construction trade.
 Whether or not you decide to start as a helper or earn a PACT certificate, consider an apprenticeship as an absolute must in becoming a journey worker. Commit to a two- to four-year program, during which you will receive both technical training in class settings and on-the-job training from a journey worker. Programs are available through various sources, so to find one in your area, contact local:Construction unions
Contract associations

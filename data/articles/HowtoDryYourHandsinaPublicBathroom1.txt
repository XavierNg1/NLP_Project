 Some warm air dryers have a start button that activates the air flow. Press the button to begin the dryer cycle. After some time, the air will stop flowing. Then, you will need to push the button again.


Use a piece of paper to press the button so that you don't get your hands dirty again.;
, If the device is activated by a motion sensor, this will start the air flow. You may need to wait for a second or two. There can sometimes be a delay while the dryer attempts to “find” your hands.
 Allow your hands to rest in the warmth of the air. Turn them slowly back and forth, and side to side, in the stream of warm air. You can do this as slowly or as quickly as you want.
 This will take a moment. You may want to count the seconds in your head to accurately judge the time.This method of hand drying takes around 45-50 seconds, so don’t rush the process.Someone with a disability, who has difficulty accessing the dryer may not be able to wait for their hands to be completely dry.
 If the dryer stops before your hands are completely dry, begin the process again. With button start air dryers, one air cycle may not be enough to get your hands dry. Start another cycle by pressing the button again if you need more drying time.
 Now, your hands are dry, so you may move them out of the air stream. Air dryers that have motion detection will stop automatically once your hands are no longer triggering the start sensor.

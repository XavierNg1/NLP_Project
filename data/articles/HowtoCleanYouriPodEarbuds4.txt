 Uncap the alcohol. Place the cotton ball on the opening of the bottle. Turn the bottle upside down for about a second and return it to its upright position. Replace the cap.


If your alcohol is in a spray bottle, use about three squirts onto the surface of the cotton ball., Do this after you've disconnected your earbuds. Move in a gentle back-and-forth motion across the surface of the mesh. Pay special attention to the edges between the mesh and the plastic. This is where much of the dirt and earwax build up.

If you find really stubborn buildup, clean those areas with cotton swabs.
Apply more alcohol if your cotton ball starts to dry out., Alcohol air dries rather quickly. Don't try to dry the surface with a paper towel or cloth. This could deposit new dirt on the surface or contaminate it with bacteria.

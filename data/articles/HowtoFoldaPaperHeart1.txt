 It’s easier to do this with the paper turned like a diamond. Bring the top point down so that it meets the bottom point. Crease the fold well and unfold the sheet.


A standard 6-inch by 6-inch (15-cm by 15-cm) square of origami paper is perfect for this process. Otherwise, you can cut a typical sheet of printer paper into a square.;
, Keeping the sheet oriented as a diamond, fold the left point over until it meets the right point. Crease the paper well before unfolding it back into its original shape.After doing this, your sheet should have two perpendicular crease marks. One should go from the top corner to the bottom, and the other should go between the side corners. The two crease marks should intersect in the center of the paper.
 Again, keep the sheet oriented like a diamond rather than a square. Fold the top of the sheet so that the top point meets the center of the paper, where the diagonal creases intersect. Crease the folded edge.
 Fold until the bottom point completely covers the folded top point. Crease the new fold. The corner should meet the center of the top edge.Note that there should now be a total of six points: three on the left and three on the right.
 Both folds should start at the middle of the sheet’s bottom edge, running parallel to the edges at the bottom corners.Fold the lowest right-hand corner up so that it meets the middle of the upper edge. Repeat this fold with the lowest left-hand corner, bringing it together with the fold made on the right.


Crease both folds well.
The bottom edge should now be a point where to diagonal edges meet.
 Fold the tips of the two top corners and two side corners inward. You should now have edges instead of corners, completing your heart.

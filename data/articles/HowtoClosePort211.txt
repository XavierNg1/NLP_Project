 The way to access these settings can be different depending on your brand of wireless router. If you don't know how to open up your router's settings, review the instructions that came with your router or do an Internet search for the information using your router's make and model. Generally, your router will be opened by either typing its IP address or by typing "router" without the quotation marks into your internet browser.;
, If a port is open and you would prefer it not to be, this may be because your wireless router's firewall is turned off. Check to see if it is still working properly, and whether or not it has port 21 listed as open.
 This will be called something different depending on the brand of your wireless router, but it will usually be named something related to ports, port forwarding, or virtual servers. In this section will be a list of ports that are kept open, or forwarded, and the programs that use them. If you see port 21 listed here, remove the listing. This tells your router you don't want that particular port open.
 When you've removed any reference within your router to port 21 being open, restart your router and your computer just to be sure. Now when you check your open ports again, port 21 will be closed.

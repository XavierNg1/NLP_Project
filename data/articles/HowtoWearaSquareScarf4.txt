 Square scarves can also be worn around your wrist as a sweatband.


To do this, lay it flat out and fold it into a triangle.
Grasp the middle point of the triangular scarf and fold it into the middle, so that the scarf looks like a narrow trapezium shape.
 Use your thumb and forefinger to keep hold of the end.


Use the fingers on the hand you are tying it to to hold it in place.
Hold it tight around your wrist when wrapping it around.



When you are done, let go of the end with your thumb and tuck both ends inside the wrapped scarf.

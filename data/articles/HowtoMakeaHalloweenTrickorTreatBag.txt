 This way, any glue residue or other sticky objects won't ruin anything.


Have at hand some more newspaper in case of emergency.
Move any special items might be damaged in the creative process. After all, it's better to be safe than sorry.
Gather all your supplies and keep them to one side. Allow enough room for your bag and some arm room so you won't knock anything over when you are fiddling with your craft objects.;
, Have it big enough to put your designs on later, but strong enough to carry around all your treats!

, We recommend the traditional Halloween colors - black and orange - but it's up to you. Orange makes a carved pumpkin, black makes a spider, white makes a scary ghost, red makes blood and lime makes slime!

, Let your imagination run wild with design possibilities - why stop at plain colored decorations?

, First, align your felt designs into the right position before attempting to glue them on. This can take away the messy hassle of having to reapply glue and removing an incorrectly positioned felt item. Then, apply a small amount of craft glue to the back of the felt. Make sure to stick down firmly so they won't fall off.



Attach a handle if your bag isn't already equipped with one. Try to attach a thick one and bind it strongly to the bag.
Add any more details to your spooky creature on your bag - such as evil eyes to a pumpkin!
Allow the glue to dry thoroughly so your designs aren't falling off on the night.

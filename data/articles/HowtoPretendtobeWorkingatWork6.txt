 You wouldn't skip breaks if you were actually working, so don't skip them when you are pretending to work.
 Bring an additional coat or jacket with you to work. Hang the second coat/jacket over your chair, so that when you are out of the building having that much needed extended lunch, it appears as if you are still in the building, but looks as if you have simply stepped away from your desk.
 Be sure to never be seen in the lobby.
 These are dead giveaways that you were away from your place of work. However, if your workplace happens to have offices in other buildings, then you have a majorly good excuse.

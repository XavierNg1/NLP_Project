 Four or five drops of each will do.
 Separate your hair into four to nine sections. Dampen your palm with the water/gel mixture and gently pull a section three or four times to wet the hair.









The more sections you use, the curlier your hair.
 Pull the section of hair through a large elastic band. Wrap the hair around the edge of the band, in and out. Keep wrapping until you reach the end of the hair.









A headband may work better for thick hair.
 Follow the same process with new elastic bands until all of your hair is wrapped.









For best results, apply hairspray to keep your curls in place.
 Go to sleep with this hair style and let it loose in the morning.

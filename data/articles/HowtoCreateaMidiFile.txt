 Most midi file editors will be exclusively in piano view, so score view midi editors are hard to find and usually cost money, however, piano-roll view is usually free. If you are used to working with note lengths and tempos, it is recommend that you take score view, if you aren't a geek when it comes to musical notation, take piano-roll.;
,, Explore the buttons, and try using the "help" menu. Usually, with a piano-roll view, you find the notes along the piano that are appropriate and click and drag on that line according to a time measure in seconds. In score view, it usually involves a more visual way of making music. There is usually a menu with different notes to select, and you place them on the score. After laying out your notes, you should be able to change tempos and add crescendo and decrescendo, ties and slurs, etc.
 There is usually a play button in the program.

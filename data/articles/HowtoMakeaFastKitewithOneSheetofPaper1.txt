 It is best to place all of the required materials on your desk, table, or wherever you plan to work. Below is what you will need to make and fly your kite:


8.5” x 11” sheet of printing paper or construction paper
Lightweight string
Pencil
Stapler
Ruler
Scissors
Hole punch (optional)
A nice breeze or light wind (6-15 mph);
, Place your paper in front of you in a vertical position with the long sides on the right and left. Fold your paper in half so that the fold (seam) is at the bottom.
 Use your pencil to make a dot at the very bottom of the folded paper, about 2” from the left edge of the fold. While you have your pencil in hand, make another dot at the very bottom of the folded paper, about 2” from the first dot for attaching the string later.


The Bumblebee (Schaeffer) kite, first created by William Schaeffer in 1973, may be the easiest of all kites to create and was designed with a simple fold that sails in gentle winds., Fold the top left end of the paper down until it is touching the first dot. Do not crease this fold. Do the exact same thing on the opposite side so that both sides are identical. Secure the ends of the folded pieces with a staple (the staple should be placed where you made the first dot)., Place tape over the second dot and make sure the piece of tape is long enough to cover both sides. Use your hole punch to make a hole over the dot. This hole is the attachment point for the string.


If you do not have a hole punch, you can carefully use scissors to create the hole.
The purpose of the tape is to reinforce the hole so that it does not tear later.
 Insert your kite string through the hole that you created and tie the string with a gentle, but tightly secured knot. If you are really feeling crafty, you can create a handle for your string with a wide stick or any tube shaped item. A handle makes it easy for you to reel in or extend your kite, and also prevents your kite from flying away.


The string is also called the flying line.

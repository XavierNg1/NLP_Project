 Rhubarb seeds are covered in a paper-like shell. Soaking the seeds for 1-2 hours before planting will prepare them for germination so that they begin rooting sooner.;
, Mix equal parts peat moss, vermiculite, and compost to make your own basic potting mix.Rhubarb does best in moderately acidic soil (pH 6.0 to 6.8). You can use a pH test kit or other methods to test the soil acidity.
 Use a small, 2-3 inch (5-8 cm) pot or starter tray with drainage holes on the bottom. Fill the pots or trays with your soil mixture. Using your finger, dig a small hole about ½ inch (1.2 cm) deep. Place 2 seeds in the hole, then cover them with dirt and water them.

Use peat pots or cow pots to make transplanting easier.
Keep the soil evenly moist, watering when necessary. Do not overwater, as this can drown the seeds.
 If the room temperature is below 70 °F (21.1 °C) (21 C), you can use a heating table or heating mat to speed the process.

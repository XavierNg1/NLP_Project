 Cut a large brown paper bag open along one corner. Spread it flat on your worktable. Try to smooth out any creases as best you can., If you’re making the hat for someone else, drape the bag over their head and center it. Smooth the paper over their skull where the hat will cover it. Make new creases and fold them over to create pleats where needed. Then wrap wide tape around the bag to act as a hat band and hold its shape. If you’re making it for yourself:Do the same over an inflatable ball that’s roughly the same size and shape as your head.
If using a ball, you may need a partner to hold it still while you tape.
 Give the brim of your hat a look over. If there’s more paper than you’d like between its edges and the tape-band, cut away the excess with scissors. Then remove the hat from your model., Cut a length of fabric to tie or glue around the tape for a more eye-catching hat band. Stuff that with straw or crinkled cardstock paper. Cut small squares from your excess paper or another paper bag, glue these to the hat where you please, and use markers to draw stitches around their edges to transform them into patches.

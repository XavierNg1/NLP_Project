 Finding a place where your dog has lots of room to run is important when you’re playing outside. Look for a place with a lot of open space, like a dog park or the beach.


If you’re having trouble finding a place, ask other dog owners where their favorite spots to play are.;
, Neither you nor your dog will have much fun if you are worried about it running out in front of a car while you’re trying to play. Find a spot that is far away from any roads or that is fenced in to prevent your dog from accidentally running into danger.
 While a big open field might be a great place for your dog to run free, it will probably get boring pretty fast for you and your dog. Look for places that have trees, bushes, and even a pond or lake. Finding a place with a variety of vegetation and different stimulants will give your dog plenty of things to explore.
 If you have a backyard at your home, make sure you build a secure fence around it if you plan to let your dog play in it. Putting up a fence will give you the peace of mind that your dog will stay safe while it is running and playing with you.

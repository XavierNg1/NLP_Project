 You and everyone in your household must have a valid Social Security number if order for your household to qualify.


On an additional note, you and everyone in your household must also be U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals.
If you are legal alien, you might still qualify as long as certain conditions are still met. See the "Special Cases" section for more detail.;
, A qualified household will have no more than $2000 in countable resources. If one person in the household is disabled or at least 60 years old, however, you can have up to $3250 in countable resources.Some resources are not countable. These include home, lot, and most retirement plans. The resources of people receiving Supplemental Security Income or of those receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families are not counted, either.
Your vehicle may or may not count as a resource depending on the state you live in. When the vehicle does count, use the fair market value ("blue book value") of the vehicle. At the present time, 39 states exclude the value of vehicles completely, 11 states exclude the value of at least one vehicle in the household and 3 states exempt an amount higher than the SNAP standard auto exemption set at $4,650 from fair market value to determine how much of the value is countable.
 Gross monthly income is the amount of money you make before any SNAP deductions are applied. You need to be at or below 130 percent of the poverty line to qualify in most cases.


Through September 30, 2013, the gross monthly income allowed by household comes out to be:

$1,211 for households with 1 member
$1,640 for households with 2 members
$2,069 for households with 3 members
$2,498 for households with 4 members
$2,927 for households with 5 members
$3,356 for households with 6 members
$3,785 for households with 7 members
$4,214 for households with 8 members
$+429 for each additional member



, Your net income refers to the amount of money you bring in after SNAP deductions are applied. This amount must be at or below the poverty line.


Through September 30, 2013, the net monthly income allowed by household comes out to be:

$931 for households with 1 member
$1,261 for households with 2 members
$1,591 for households with 3 members
$1,921 for households with 4 members
$2,251 for households with 5 members
$2,581 for households with 6 members
$2,911 for households with 7 members

, Under most conditions, any able-bodied person in the household between the ages of 16 and 60 must be registered to work or part of an employment or training program in order for your household to qualify.


If you are between 18 and 50 and without children, you can only get benefits for 3 months in a 36-month period if you do not work or take part in a workfare/employment/training program outside of a standard job search.
You must register for work, accept suitable employment, and participate in an employment/training program if you are able-bodied and between the ages of 16 and 60.
 Certain conditions that could put a strain on your financial situation can be deducted or subtracted from your gross income. Each deduction has its own value, so you need to know that value before you can subtract that deduction.


You can subtract 20% from earned income
Subtract a standard deduction of $149 if your household has 1 to 3 people, or a standard deduction of $160 if your household holds 4 and up.
You can take a dependent care deduction when needed for work, training, or education. This value can vary by state.
Subtract medical expenses for elderly or disabled members when they are more they $35 monthly and not covered by someone else.
Deduct legally owed child support payments.
Check with your state to determine if you have a homeless household. You might be able to subtract $143 for shelter costs.
Subtract excess shelter costs that are more than half of the household's income after other deductions are taken.
 After you subtract your deductions, the value left will be your net income. As mentioned before, your net income must be at or below the poverty level for you to qualify.


See the “Standard Eligibility” section to determine if your net income falls within the appropriate value range.
 Regardless of how much you earn, you will be expected to contribute 30 percent of your household net income toward food.


Round the value up to the nearest whole number.
 Subtract 30 percent of your net income from the maximum allotment of benefits for a household of your size to determine your SNAP allotment for each month.For October 2013, the maximum monthly benefit by household size is:

$200 for households with 1 member
$367 for households with 2 members
$526 for households with 3 members
$668 for households with 4 members
$793 for households with 5 members
$952 for households with 6 members
$1,052 for households with 7 members
$150 for each additional person


For November 2013 through September 2013, the maximum monthly benefit by household size is:

$189 for households with 1 member
$347 for households with 2 members
$497 for households with 3 members
$632 for households with 4 members
$750 for households with 5 members
$900 for households with 6 members
$995 for households with 7 members
$142 for each additional person



, An elderly resident is anyone 60 years old or older. If an elderly resident is part of your household, there are a few exceptions to the qualifications.


If you are the head of a household and cannot file the application due to age or disability, you can appoint an authorized representative in writing to apply and interview on your behalf.
Elderly residents of federally subsidized housing for the elderly might still qualify for benefits even if the facility provides meals; the same applies for disabled individuals living in nonprofit group living arrangements with no more than 16 residents.
Your resources can come to no more than $3,250.
Your household only has to meet the net income test instead of both the gross and net income tests.
 If there is a member of your household who is legally disabled, the same exceptions used for elderly members apply to this situation, as well. Someone is considered disabled if he or she:


Receives federal disability or blindness payments under the Social Security Act (including SSI or Social Security disability/blindness payments)
Receives state disability or blindness payments based on SSI restrictions
Receives disability retirement benefits from a government agency because of a permanent disability
Receives annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act and qualifies for Medicare or is otherwise considered disabled by SSI restrictions
Is a veteran who is completely disabled, permanently housebound, or who needs regular aid/attendance
Is a surviving spouse or child of a veteran receiving VA benefits and permanently disabled

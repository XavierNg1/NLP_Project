 Musicians like Abeda parveen, Nusrat Fatih Ali Khan or play Poetry of RUMI like Caught in the fire of Love sang by Martin Sheen, I am yours by Robert John Burke. Sufi music will be your most impacted tool in the Sufi wedding as SAMA and ZIKER is a part of Sufism. Sama means "listening", while Zikur means "remembrance‚Äù often includes singing, playing instruments, dancing, recitation of poetry and prayers and wearing symbolic attire.
 They are easily available but never compromise on quality as Sufi music or dance is a sensitive art which can easily lose its beauty if performed by an untrained artist.

 Soak a clean, soft washcloth in cool water, ringing out the excess once drenched. Gently press the washcloth beneath and around your eyes, making sure to cover the entire bagged area. Continue for about five minutes.Do this while sitting upright to encourage any pooled fluids beneath your eyes to drain.
The cold compress--and other cooling techniques--work by constricting the blood vessels responsible for discoloration and swelling beneath the eye.;
, Remove one spoon and carefully apply it to the swollen, dark circle beneath your eye, pressing lightly. Keep it there until the spoon warms to the temperature of your skin.Return the used spoon to the ice water and take out a new spoon. Repeat this process with the bag beneath your other eye.
Continue as needed, swapping out warmed spoons for chilled ones, for anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes, depending on how long it takes to reduce the appearance of both bags.
 Relax in an upright position with your head slightly back for about 25 minutes.Since cucumbers have a high water content, they're naturally cool and hydrating, making them surprisingly great at relieving swollen eyes. Cucumbers also contain quercetin, an antioxidant that blocks histamine, which may reduce bags under the eye caused by allergies.
 Dunk two tea bags in cold water, then place them in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes to get them even chillier. When they're ready, place the tea bags over closed eyes, covering the bagged area. Lie back with your head slightly elevated and continue treatment for 25 to 30 minutes.Afterward, wash your eyes and face with cool water and pat the skin dry.
Avoid tea bags containing potent spices that may irritate your eyes. Chamomile tea and green tea have natural healing properties, making them ideal options, but plain black tea or decaffeinated black tea would also work.

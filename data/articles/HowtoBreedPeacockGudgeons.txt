 Decorate your aquarium with small caves (the narrower the better). The male prefers a 3" long x1" diameter PVC pipe with both ends open. He may block one end with substrate. To make caves smaller, bury them in the substrate so that they are no more than half full of substrate.;
, This will give infusoria (tiny organisms that will be eaten by the fry) a place to live. Other fuzzy plants will do too. Try java ferns, mosses, hair-grass.
 He then performs his mating dance and nudges the female into the cave where they will spawn. Afterwards, he will kick her out, and fan the eggs for 3-4 days until hatched. If you leave the eggs in the tank, they will probably be eaten by the parents. Chances of survival are best if eggs are removed to a separate tank/breeder box.
 Set up your breeder box according to the package directions. There are several kinds of fish breeder box. Some go inside the tank and use the flow of the tank filter. External boxes may require a small air pump and tubing to circulate water. Proper air flow is necessary to prevent fungus from growing on the eggs. Once the eggs are no longer being fanned by the male, be sure to place the cave so that water circulates through it. Try turning the end toward the filter output or airstone.
 Tilt it to let the male fall out (he may stay with it to the surface). Set the cave down in the breeder box.
 They swim near the surface.

Do a 10% water change daily in the first week after hatching.
Perform weekly 30% water changes until fry reach sexual maturity in 7-9 months.

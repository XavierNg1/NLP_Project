 When a screw is stripped, attempt to remove it with a different screwdriver.









First, try using a shorter screw driver with a larger head. Apply downward pressure and slowly attempt to remove the screw.
If this doesnâ€™t work, try using a screwdriver with a different type of head. If the screw is a philips head, try a flathead screwdriver. When using a flathead screwdriver, it must be narrow enough to fit inside the entire hole. Apply downward pressure and try to extract the screw.;
, Place your screwdriver into the head. Grab a hammer and tap the base of the screwdriver. This will lodge your screwdriver into the head, providing you with more grip. Set down the hammer and attempt to remove the screw.This method works best with soft-metal screws.
 If there is a slight gap between the surface and the head of the screw, try rotating the screw out with a pair of pliers, or vice grips. Secure the screw within the mouth of the locking pliers. Rotate the pliers and try to turn the stuck screw out.
 Select the correct drill bit and power up your electric screwdriver. Carefully drill a small, shallow hole into the head. This will allow your screwdriver to sit deeper in the head of the screw. Retrieve your screwdriver and insert it into the head. Apply downward force as you attempt to remove the screw.
 Attach a metal cutting disc to the Dremel, or small electronic rotator. Power up the tool and cut a new notch in the screw head. Grab a flathead screwdriver and put it in the newly cut slot. Rotate the screwdriver and try to remove the striped screw.

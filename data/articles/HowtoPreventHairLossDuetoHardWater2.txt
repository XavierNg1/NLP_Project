 There are shampoos available that are specifically designed for hard water that can help you lower the chances of hair loss.A "chelating" or "clarifying" shampoo is a good choice. These shampoos are designed to tackle and prevent mineral build-up in your hair, but they are harsh so should be used sparingly.Look for a shampoo with the ingredient EDTA.
Only use this shampoo once a week.
Use a moisturising conditioner after you use this shampoo., It's always a good idea to use a conditioner after you wash your hair in hard water. This will help to prevent your hair drying out and becoming brittle, which can contribute to hair loss. Look for a conditioner with natural ingredients that will moisturise your hair.


Argon oil is an intensely moisturising ingredient to look out for.You can find conditioners especially designed for hard water areas.
 To condition your hair even more, you can use a leave in conditioner. This just means you lightly apply it to your hair after washing and let it soak in. Two or three drops of coconut or almond oil gently rubbed into the lower half of your hair will help you to lock in the moisture and prevent dryness.Don't apply more than this or you will end up with greasy hair.
The importance of having a good hair care regime to prevent hair loss is heightened by being in a hard water area.

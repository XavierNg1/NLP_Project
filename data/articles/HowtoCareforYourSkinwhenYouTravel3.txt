 Tight clothing, or clothing made from rayon or nylon, can cause rashes during travel. As your skin will already be sensitive, be conscious of this when selecting clothing. Opt for loose fitting cotton clothes, which will be less likely to cause skin rashes., Hydration is important for your skin. Strive to drink water regularly to keep your skin healthy. Carry a water bottle with you when traveling. Drink water with meals over other beverage options.If you're drinking alcohol, try to match every drink with a glass of water.
 Makeup can block pores, causing skin problems. As your skin is more sensitive when you're traveling, wearing a little less makeup than usual can help prevent skin problems on the road. While you may like the idea of doing elaborate makeup for special occasions, remember that this can harm your skin.If you had your heart set on doing your full makeup for certain events, do so but remove makeup before bed. Stick to minimal makeup other days, or no makeup at all, to give your skin a chance to breathe.
 A lack of sleep is never good for your skin. Not sleeping while traveling can make your skin more prone to travel-based skin issues. Strive to get a solid night's sleep every night, as this is likely to help prevent travel-related skin issues., For a variety of health reasons, maintaining a regular exercise routine while traveling is important. It can also help your skin stay strong. Try to exercise when you can, even when you're traveling.If you're staying in a hotel with a gym, use it. You can also check and see whether gyms near you offer guest passes.
If you can't find a gym, go running or hiking. A long walk or jog can get you just as much exercise as a trip to the gym.

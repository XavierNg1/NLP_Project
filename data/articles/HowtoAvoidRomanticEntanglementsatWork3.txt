 If someone at work is giving you unwanted attention, you can try to drop a few hints to get them to back down. For instance, if they are always asking you to have drinks or go out for dinner, you can always have another commitment. If they come around to your desk too often, you can say you have too much work to chat. Try to subtly place the emphasis back on work.For instance, if the person comes up to your desk and lingers, you could say, "I'm sorry. I'm really busy today, and I don't have time to chat."

, If you've given someone hints that you aren't interested and they haven't taken them, it's time to be direct. Tell them that you are not interested in having a romantic relationship at work, and that you'd like to keep your relationship professional. Also, discuss any behaviors you find inappropriate.For instance, you could say, "I don't know for sure if this is where you're going, but I'd really like to keep my relationships at work strictly professional. When you ask me out for drinks, I get the feeling you are interested in something more. It has nothing to do with you, but I never pursue romantic relationships at work."

, If you're getting unwanted attention, it's important to know where your company stands on the issue. Read your company's policy before bringing the issue to a manager, as you'll be able to couch the issue in terms that the company uses., If the unwanted attention continues, it's important that your boss or human resources knows, depending on the company. Your company's sexual harassment policy should tell you who to approach. Bring up the problem you're having, and ask them what they can do to help you.


For example, you could say, "I've made it clear to John that I'm not interested in him romantically, yet he keeps asking me out. I think that falls under sexual harassment after reading the company's policy. Can you help me deal with this issue?"

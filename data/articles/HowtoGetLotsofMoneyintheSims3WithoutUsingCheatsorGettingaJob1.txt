 You can place it anywhere, but I suggest placing it outside so that you can have a bit more room in your Sim's house.;
, You'll have the option to paint a big, medium, or small painting. Paint a big painting as it may sell for more.
 It will not sell for much to begin with, but as your painting skill increases, you will be able to sell your paintings for a lot of money!

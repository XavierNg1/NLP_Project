 Emotional abuse is the use of verbal or psychological abuse to control or subjugate another person. This sort of abuse can be displayed in a number of ways, including:


Constantly criticizing the woman by mocking, scolding or bullying her.
Using emotions like extreme jealousy, hostility, or aggression to intimidate and manipulate her.
Refusing to be pleased, even when the woman is doing everything within her power to try to make the person happy.
Threatening and scaring the woman with gestures and actions without actually physically hurting her.
 When a woman is in an emotionally abusive relationship, she may begin to act differently. Abusive relationships can take a toll psychologically, and a once outgoing and friendly woman may become withdrawn or depressed. If a woman you know develops the following characteristics, she may be in an emotionally abusive relationship.


She shows a low confidence level and lacks self-esteem.
She is embarrassed to voice her opinions, and may not maintain eye contact with you when she does.
She may withdraw from other relationships, like friendships, and may mention that her partner is “very jealous” or “protective”.
She may cry a lot, or look like she has recently been crying; her eyes may be red, puffy, and swollen, with dark circles underneath them.
 Emotional abuse, which can also be called psychological abuse, can also involve denying the woman her right to practice her religion. Her abuser may put her down for her beliefs or religion. The abuser may also:


Limit her access to her place of worship.
Prohibit her from performing religious acts.
Force her to participate in the abuser’s religion against her will.

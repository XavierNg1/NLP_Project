 For the juice, you’ll need 3 medium tomatoes that are cut into large chunks, 7 celery stalks cut into 3-inch (7.5-cm) pieces, ½ pound (225 g) of carrots that are cut into 3-inch (7.5-cm) pieces, and a piece of fresh horseradish that’s 2 ½ by ¼ inches (64 by 6 millimeters). Juice all of the ingredients into a single container according to your juicer’s manufacturer instructions.Stir all of the juices together with a spoon to ensure that they’re fully blended.
 Once the juices are mixed, add ¼ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of coarse salt and 2 ½ teaspoons (12 ½ ml) of freshly squeezed lemon juice into the container. Stir well to ensure that the salt and juice are fully incorporated.You can adjust the amount of salt and lemon juice to suit your tastes.
 After all of the ingredients are mixed, pour the mixture through a fine mesh sieve into a large pitcher. Shake the sieve well to ensure you get all of the juice separated from any solid pieces., When the juice is strained, divide it evenly between two glasses. Press a lemon wedge onto the side of each glass and serve.You can float the lemon wedge in the juice if you prefer.

 One of the most common fearful behaviors in kittens is fear of humans. The best way for your kitten to get over this fear and to become a well-adjusted adult cat later in life is to make your kitten interact with many people, especially while it is quite young. Don’t force your kitten to do things it doesn’t like, but make sure your kitten is around a variety of people so that it grows accustomed to humans coming and going in your home.Remind any children that interact with your fearful kitten to treat the cat gently and avoid scaring it on purpose.
Ask people your kitten seems scared of to offer the kitten treats so that it becomes less afraid of new people over time.
 Kittens are often afraid of other animals they encounter in your home, so you’ll need to work on building up your kitten’s positive experiences with any other pets you may have. Try transferring some of your other pet’s scent onto the kitten by petting the other animal first and then holding your kitten without washing your hands.Introduce your kitten to new animals one at a time. This will help you avoid overwhelming the already frightened kitten.
 Try to help your scared kitten overcome its fear by desensitizing it with treats. This means that you should have another family member hold the kitten while the scary loud noise is happening. They should pet the kitten and give it treats to make it forget about the noise.Kittens are often afraid of loud noises in your home. This can include things like vacuum cleaners, hair dryers, power tools, or even storms outside.

 There are two reagents used to do colorimetric analysis of dissolved oxygen. One is indigo carmine and the other is rhodazine D. If you expect low levels of dissolved oxygen, rhodazine D is a good choice. Use indigo carmine for higher levels of dissolved oxygen., Once you have chosen a reagent, introduce it to a sample of water. Drop the reagent into the sample of water and watch for a color change. The deeper the color, the more dissolved oxygen present.Indigo carmine will produce a deep blue color.
Rhodazine D will produce a deep pink color.
 If you are using rhodazine D, record the dissolved oxygen range promptly at thirty seconds after adding the reagent. The same holds true for measuring small ranges of dissolved oxygen with indigo carmine. If you are measuring a sample with higher levels of dissolved oxygen, wait two minutes and record the result.

 For best results, select a Russet potato to bake in the microwave. Scrub the potato to remove all dirt since the skin will be left on for cooking. Rinse the potato thoroughly and dry.Use a paring knife to remove blemishes from the potato.;
, Poke 4-5 holes on each side of the potato using a fork. These holes will allow steam to escape during cooking and prevent the potato from exploding in the microwave. Place the potato in a microwave-safe plate or dish., Microwave the potato on full power for three minutes. Stop the microwave and remove the potato to check. A single potato should take just over five minutes to cook, but it is better to err on the side of caution to avoid overcooking it. If you opt for a potato other than Russet, alter the cooking time accordingly (less for a smaller potato and more for larger potato).
 Using an oven mitt or kitchen towel, gently squeeze the sides of the potato. If the potato is tender enough to give under the pressure and for the skin to break and open up, it is done. If the potato is still firm, place it back in the microwave and check it again after another minute of cooking., Once its done, slice open the top of your baked potato with a sharp knife. Place a folded paper towel over the cut and use your other hand to push down on it to open the potato. Fluff out the inside of the potato with a fork and add toppings such as:Sour cream
Chives
Crumbled bacon
Shredded cheese
Chili
Ground beef

 The one-piece version is made with a hole in the middle, so you can easily slip it over your head. The two piece version also includes an underscarf for extra coverage on your head.
 Put it on like you would a headband. It should sit over your forehead, to provide extra coverage there. If you have a one-piece version, you can skip this step.
 Arrange it so that your face is encircled by the scarf, with its folds draping over your shoulders, chest and back.
 Make sure it's securely in place and won't fall off.

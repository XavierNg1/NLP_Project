 The better the recording, the better your final product can be. Some things you can do to improve your recording include:



Choosing appropriate recording devices. Different types of microphones work better for different sounds. Find out what microphone(s) work best for your instrument(s)/environment. Make sure to use high quality cables and connectors.

Recording in a space with good acoustics. Some space shapes and sizes work better for different recordings. You might want to stay away from spaces that echo or are so confined that sound is distorted (then again, that may be the sound you are looking for).

Eliminating as much background noise as possible. Machines creating noise in the background can add a hiss to your recording that may be impossible to get rid of.

Recording multiple takes. It may be a sound decision to record your audio multiple times in order to get the highest quality possible.;
, If you record with another program or device before using Audacity, make sure you export/extract that audio with the highest fidelity possible. Conversion from one format to another can also cause loss in quality.
 If you can afford and have the ability to upgrade your sound card, do so. At the very least, download the latest drivers for your current sound card.
 If your speakers or headphones do not represent your audio with fidelity, they may deceive you. Others may hear flaws easier if they have higher quality speakers or headphones.

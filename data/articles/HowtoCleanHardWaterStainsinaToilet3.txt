 If you use your toilet brush for a few seconds every day, you can pick up excess water. This will make it less likely that hard water spots will form and save you the trouble of an intensive clean., Bleach can be a good disinfectant. But it will cause rust stains to set, making it more difficult to remove some hard water spots. It can also be dangerous when mixed with other toilet bowl cleaners., Older toilet bowl cleaners had metal bristles. These could scratch up the insides of a toilet. This is counterproductive, because once a toilet bowl is scratched, it is easier for dirt to get into the scratches and next to impossible to get it out., When you flush with the bowl open it is possible for water to escape, getting some all over the toilet. This is unsanitary and increases the risk of hard water marks forming., If given the time, these stains will only settle in and become more difficult to remove. If you see stains appearing that canâ€™t be removed with a simple scrubbing, immediately use either vinegar or heavy cleaning solutions to pick them up.

"The most basic way to express thanks in Italian is with a simple grazie.


The term is used as an interjection for "thanks" or "thank you."
A rough pronunciation of grazie is gra-zee, but a slightly more accurate pronunciation would be GRAHT-see+eh.




No has the same meaning in Italian as it has in English.
Pronounce the phrase as no GRAHT-see+eh.

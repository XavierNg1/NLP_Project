 The numerators and denominators of the two fractions should be aligned.


Ex: 2/4 * 2/4

, To simplify the first fraction, 2/4, simply divide its numerator and denominator by the largest number that can go into each number. Since the largest number that goes into both 2 and 4 is 2, you should divide both 2 and 4 by 2. Here's how to do it:


2/2 = 1
4/2 = 2
Your new fraction is 1/2. It is an equivalent fraction of 2/4, which means it has the same value.

You can also find the largest number that is divides into both the numerator and denominator by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of both numbers. To do this, simply list all the factors of those numbers, and choose the largest one that both share. Here's how:
2: 1, 2.
4: 1, 2, 4.
2 is the largest number that divides into both 2 and 4.
 To finish the process, you need to simplify the second fraction as well as the first. Since the second fraction, 2/4, is the same as the first, your answer will be the same.


2/4 = 1/2

, Multiply the numerators of the fractions 1/2 and 1/2, which are 1 and 1.


1 * 1 = 1.
 Multiply the denominators of the fractions 1/2 and 1/2, which are 2 and 2.


2 * 2 = 4.
 Since you already simplified at the beginning of the problem, you've found your final answer.


1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.

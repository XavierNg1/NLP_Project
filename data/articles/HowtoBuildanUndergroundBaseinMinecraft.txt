 Just punch down trees; it'll be slow at first, but punch down 5-10 trees. Don't bother with the leaves unless you want to replant.;
, Place wood blocks directly into your crafting area in your inventory (Press "E" to access inventory) and turn all of the wood except for five pieces into wood planks.
 Make a workbench by filling each of the four crafting slots with wood planks. Note that while they can be any kind of wood, it will have to be the same kind of wood. It is not necessary to craft more than one workbench.
 Create a few sticks by placing two wood planks, one on top of another, in the crafting window. Place two sticks, one on top of the other, in the bottom middle and center. Then, across the top row, place 3 wooden planks.
 Mine some stone. It's best to mine about 30 stone, as it will be useful to have a little bit of extra stone later on.
 Fill every crafting slot except for the middle, at a workbench, to create a furnace.
 Use the furnace. Place some wood (not planks) in the top left of the furnace, and place some wood planks in the lower left of the furnace. This will burn the wood on the top, giving you charcoal.
 Once you have five charcoal, make five more sticks if you don't have them already. Then, place all of your charcoal into one space on the crafting area, then as many sticks as you have charcoal underneath the charcoal. This will make torches. Make as many as you want/need.
 For the first night, dig down three blocks, seal the top of the hole off, and place a torch. After you have done that, and you are safe, you can dig.
 After you have dug a hole, you can expand. Feel free to make your base as big as you want, and as cool as you want.

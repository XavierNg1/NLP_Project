 Do not let the desire to do something perfectly stop you from doing the thing! Precision can be very important, but only up to a point. Make a plan, and think about the contingencies, and think about what it will mean to do this thing right â€“ but then do it! Don't wait, and don't procrastinate. You may find that once you get started, everything becomes much more clear.


Self-doubt can be crippling. Remember that you can only give what you have. Instead of focusing on some rigid ideal of "rightness," think about how you can put your own uniquely "right" spin on the situation.
 Exercise discipline and stay accountable to yourself. Learn how to do what you need to do, and do it more often as you improve. Make a commitment to becoming more effective. The more practiced and confident you are, the easier it will be to do things right.
 It is a wonderful sentiment to want to do things right. However: correctness can be narrow and subjective, and it is important to remember that there are often many ways to do a thing. Don't be too hard on yourself! Try to do things right, but also try to do them thoughtfully. Make sure that your heart's in it.Do not lose sight of why you're trying to do things right. Do not let your obligations and responsibilities cloud your purpose.
Don't be afraid to challenge and change the way that things are laid out. You are the one doing these things! You have the power and prerogative to take ownership of your actions and set your own course.

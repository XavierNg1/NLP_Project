 If your games start taking a long time to load, or they become stutter or crash, it may be indicative of a looming hardware failure.






;
, If your system locks up, even when not playing games, this is a sign of hardware failing.
 There are 5 different light codes displayed around the Power button on the Xbox 360. Each of the codes represents a different failure state.









Green lights. Green lights indicate that the console is powered and operating correctly. The number of green lights indicates how many controllers are connected.
One red light. This is the Hardware Failure indicator. It is usually accompanied by an “E74” or similar code displayed on the TV. This is caused by the video scalar chip being damaged.
Two red lights. This is an overheating error. If the console becomes too hot, the system will shut down and display this light code. The fans will continue running until the components have been cooled.
Three red lights. This is the General Hardware Failure, also known as the Red Ring of Death. This indicates that one or more components have failed, and that the system is no longer operable unless you turn off your console for 24 hours. No error code will be displayed on the TV.
Four red lights. This indicates that the AV cable is not correctly plugged in. Check the connection from the console to the TV. This code will not display for HDMI connections.

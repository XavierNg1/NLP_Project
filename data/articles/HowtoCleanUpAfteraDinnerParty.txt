 If not, have at least someone else to talk to you as you whiz around cleaning up. This person (spouse, friend, child, whoever), can debrief on how the evening went; you'll be surprised how quickly the cleaning goes with friendly banter in the background and even more so if the other person pitches in too.;
, These will smell terrible in the morning when you wake all refreshed. Put them into the recycling bin immediately. Stopper any unfinished wine and store where appropriate. Pour unfinished beer in the garden and screw on the lids for liqueurs and spirits.
 Either stack them neatly on the kitchen sink if the dishwasher is already full of cooking pans, or stack them directly into the dishwasher. Tackle the dishes in the sink if you're not too tired, as a clean bench space is far more inspirational than a pile of dirty dishes next morning.
 Refrigerate items that must be stored cold. This should be done during the course of the evening; judge whether an item has been left out too long to keep otherwise. Put nuts and nibbles back into their original bags or into airtight containers.
, Plump up the cushions and straighten rugs, lamps, small tables etc. that were moved for the event. Let a little air in if possible.
 You can use a micro-cloth cleaning apparatus if you have one - these will pick up things very quickly. If you are too tired to do this, at the very least wipe up spills and crumb piles and leave the sweeping to tomorrow.
 You will probably sleep like a log. Well done!

 They are generally what you use when getting your nails professionally done. UV lights use ultra-violent waves to dry your polish quickly and into a solid coat.These lights are often recommended for gel coats.
 Instead of using a product to quickly dry your nails, there are polishes out there that advertise quick drying times. Use these polishes to get a quick manicure., Nail polishes add thickeners to properly stay consistent. You can make your polish thinner, and thus easier to evaporate and dry, by adding a commercial drying drop to the polish after application.Your favorite polish brands may carry dry drops specifically designed for their polishes. Look at your local retailer for more information.

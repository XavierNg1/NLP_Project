 Brushing wet hair not only disrupts your hairâ€™s cuticles, it can also stretch hair, leading to breakage. Instead, gently squeeze your hair with a microfiber tower or old t-shirt and comb or finger comb it.Add a touch of your preferred conditional or anti-frizz product.
 If you can't brush dry hair but still have to have a decent head of hair on a humid or brisk day, wet your hands and then finger-comb your hair to tackle any frizz and tame any tangles., This way, you are still giving your hair a lift without drying the hair shaft and hair tips.


Look for a blow dryer with a diffuser, as this can limit the amount of heat being blasted on your roots.
 As you blow dry your roots, spin around brush through your hair to help smooth the cuticles flat., Towel drying roughs up your hair's cuticle so instead of lying flat, it looks frizzy. Instead, use an absorbent microfiber towel to gently press water out of your hair., These products will only cook your curls, rather than hydrate them and lead to more frizz., These treatments can make your hair brittle and lead to breakage, so go easy on them or avoid them completely. You can use heat-protecters on your hair if you need to. Try a heatless way to straighten/curl your hair.

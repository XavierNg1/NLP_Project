 Try to use a fresh, ripe banana. You can also use a frozen banana instead for a thicker smoothie. Cutting the banana up first will give you a smoother drink in the end.
 Don't add the rest of the ingredients yet. Those are your garnishes, and will be added last.
 There should be no chunks of banana left when you are done. From time to time, you may need to push the smoothie down the walls of the blender. This will help things blend more evenly.
 For a fancier touch, consider using a fancy milkshake glass with a short stem and wide brim. If you need to, use a spatula to help guide the smoothie into the glasses.
 Add a swirl of whipped cream and a drizzle of hot fudge on top of the smoothie. Place a maraschino cherry on top of the whipped cream, then shake some sprinkles on top., Stick a tall straw into each glass. If you have a long dessert spoon, you can use it to eat the garnish.


If you don't have a blender, try using a food processor fitted with metal blades instead.

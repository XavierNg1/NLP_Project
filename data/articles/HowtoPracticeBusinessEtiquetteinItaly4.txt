 Try to put any business appointment in writing (most preferably in Italian), so you have something to show if things don't work out according to plan. It is also helpful to confirm the meeting by a call, email or a fax––anything that results in reminding those attending the meeting that it's still happening.


Try not to schedule meetings in August unless those meeting with you make it clear they'll be available. Many businesses are closed during these period and people are on holiday; it could be awkward if someone feels compelled to fly back to Rome just to meet with you.
 Italian business, particularly in the northern regions, value the punctuality of others. Prompt attendance at a meeting also says a lot about your reliability and enthusiasm, so it's best to be five minutes early than five minutes late.


Should those you are meeting turn up late (Italian business people outside of the northern regions are less concerned with their own punctuality than perhaps with yours), do not make an issue out of it. Accept apologies and move on as if nothing untoward has happened. You can surmise whatever you want from it after the meeting but during the meeting it is best to appear unruffled and ready to make deals.
 This helps you colleagues; moreover, it also makes them appreciate your effort. It will help them to see that you are serious about doing business with them.
 This will ensure that the conversation runs more smoothly and that there are no misunderstandings. Do not rely on the ability of the other business people to speak English; that is too much of a burden for you to place upon them. It also leaves you at risk of not understanding what you really need to know.

 Google Chrome will need to be installed before you can set it as your default browser. You can install Chrome by visiting google.com/chrome/ and clicking "Download" at the top of the screen.
 To install Chrome, click the DMG file in your Downloads folder, then drag the Google Chrome icon into the Applications folder. You can delete the DMG file once the installation is complete.
 Once Chrome is installed, you can set it as the default browser from the System Preferences menu.
 You can find this at the top of the "System Preferences" menu.
 This will set Chrome as the default browser for all web links and HTML files.

 Buy cute wrapping paper to use as a wallpaper for the inside of the locker door. Cut the paper to size, and tape it up nicely. Don't let the tape show.
 For quotes, go to a scrapbook store. There you can find cute quotes that are all decorated and pretty. Get some magnetic strips and attach them to the backs of the quote.
 Attach them to a decorative ribbon to hang pictures and other small items from. Hang from one of the hooks in the locker.
 Aim to fill the whole back wall of the locker.
 Attach it to the back of the locker for fun between periods. Of course, this will only work if there is space.


This should fold down, otherwise it's probable that another student will either bump into it or pull it down.
 Find a magazine that you don't mind cutting up. Cut our your favorite words or pictures. Glue them onto the paper. Take a small picture of you (and maybe your locker mate) and glue it on top. Tape over it all to provide strength and durability. Put it in your locker.
 This will make it look cute and festive and gives you a chance to redecorate every few months.

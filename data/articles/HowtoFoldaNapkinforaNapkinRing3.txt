 This fold is simple, formal, and easy — perfect for last minute preparations for a wedding or fancy party.To start, fold the bottom edge of the napkin up to the top to make a rectangle. To be clear, the bottom edge of your napkin should be folded and the top edge should be open.


While a square napkin is best here, the material of the napkin isn't as important for the double roll as it is for other types of napkin folds because the napkin doesn't need to support its own weight. Thus, this is a fine choice if you're working with paper napkins.
 Next, take one side of the napkin and tightly roll it inward. Stop when you reach the rough middle point of the napkin. Use the napkin ring or a plate to hold this roll in place while you tackle the other edge.
 Next, repeat the same rolling procedure for the other side of the napkin. The two rolls should meet in the middle of the napkin. They should be roughly the same size — if they're not, you may want to make minor adjustments so that they're symmetrical.
 Simply pull the ring over the double-rolled napkin so that it rests roughly in the middle point. That's it! Your napkins are ready to be given to your guests or arranged as you please. If you have any spare ribbon lying around, these skinny rolls look even better tied up with a bow!


Don't forget to arrange your napkins rolls-side up — otherwise, they'll just look like an ordinary roll or bundle.

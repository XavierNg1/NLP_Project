 Use another pre-treatment stain remover product at home if you find that the Tide to Go Pen hasn’t effectively removed the stain. Do this as soon as you are able, and before you machine wash or dry clean your garment.


Follow any instructions on your individual stain remover product, as they may vary in their application.
Consider the type of food or drink that caused the stain when you treat it further at home. A greasy stain may warrant the use of hot water, for example, while a wine stain needs cool water., Pay attention to the instructions given on care for your specific garment’s fabric and style. Wash by hand, machine, or dry cleaning as instructed.


Look for the care tag along a collar, waist, or side seam of any garment. If you no longer have one, look for the fabric content. Most common natural and synthetic fabrics like cotton or polyester can be machine washed.Delicate fabrics like silk and cashmere, and items with beaded or embroidered detail, usually require hand washing or dry cleaning.
Wash a stained garment as soon as possible for a better chance at getting it out.
 Follow the care instructions for your clothing after washing it, taking care not to apply heat from a dryer or iron until the stain is out. Hang, lay flat, or machine dry as instructed.


After washing your garment, check to see if there is a remaining stain. If there is, treat it again with a stain remover and rewash. Don’t put it in a dryer until the stain is out, otherwise the heat will set it in.You may want to alter the exact drying instructions on your garment’s care tag if you are concerned about a stubborn stain. Hang up or place an item on a towel away from sunlight, which are gentler drying options that won’t set in any existing stain with heat.

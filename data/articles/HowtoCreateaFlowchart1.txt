 The key to a successful flowchart is its readability. Make sure that your core concepts are simply stated, and that the progression from concept to concept is explained in simple steps.


Make sure that you have a distinct end point for your chart planned. This will help make it easier to read.;
, A standard flowchart breaks a process down by its key concepts and required actions. If you have multiple groups involved in the process outlined by the flowchart, a swimlane format can help show who needs to do what. Each flowchart step is placed in the “Lane” for the group responsible for completing the task (Marketing, Sales, HR, etc.).


Swimlanes are typically formatted horizontally or vertically. The starting point is the top-left corner of the chart.
Swimlanes can be difficult to design if you have multiple concepts that have to travel back and forth between departments. This will lead to muddled charts.
 Before you start designing your flowchart through software, draw it out on a scratch piece of paper. Place your starting concept at the top, and expand the chart out below it.


Most flowcharts operate on a basic binary principle. At points in the process where variations occur, the reader is presented with a Yes or No question. The answer will guide the reader to the appropriate concept.
Use different shapes to represent different types of concepts or decisions. Adding visual cues will help with readability and comprehension.
 If areas of your flowchart are becoming too dense, separate the subprocess into a new flowchart. Add a box as a reference to the subprocess in the original flowchart, and have the reader return to it when they get through the expanded section.

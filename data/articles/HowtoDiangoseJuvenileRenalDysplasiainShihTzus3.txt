 Management of renal dysplasia revolves around managing the symptoms. There is no curing this condition. Treatment consists of a diet formulated to decrease the workload of the kidneys. Many veterinarians use a prescription diet to properly balance the need for nutrition, a decrease kidney function, and appealing to your dog’s picky appetite.Anti nausea medication may be prescribed since the toxins in the bloodstream can cause nausea.
Always have fresh water available for your Shih Tzu.
B and C vitamins and potassium are all lost easily through frequent urination, so supplementation of certain nutrients may be necessary. Your Shih Tzu will have decreased need for certain nutrients, such as phosphorus, calcium, and sodium, which all can build up in the body.
High blood pressure may develop and need to be treated.
Dehydration may need to be combated through subcutaneous (under the skin) or IV fluid treatment.
Anemia or low red blood cells may develop and need monitoring and treatment as needed.
 Renal dysplasia occurs when the kidneys fail to develop properly while the puppy is developing in the mother dog’s uterus.Renal dysplasia can happen in one kidney or in both kidneys, leaving the affected kidney small, firm, and pale colored.


Kidney function is also altered due to the improper development.
Due to the kidney not developing properly, toxins are not filtered from the bloodstream like normal. These toxins then build up in the blood causing serious symptoms.
 A dog with renal dysplasia typically develops symptoms while young. Most dogs develop the condition between six months and two years of age. Juvenile renal dysplasia is common, so starting around six months of age you should start monitoring your Shih Tzu.However, dogs of any age can be affected due to the differences in the severity of the damage to the kidneys. Some dogs do not show symptoms until later in life.

 Here's a few to get you started:;
,, If you want this to be a good survival guide, you need to cover as many school-related topics as possible. Once you have as many topics has humanly possible, you can start writing your guide.
 When writing a survival guide, it's a great idea to reflect on your own experiences. How did you survive your first failed test? Write about it. You'll find that it's actually really easy to write a survival guide as long as you use your previous experiences and make it as relatable as possible.
 Did your friend have to survive going to school for a week with blue hair? Or a day with toilet paper stuck to their shoe? How did they deal with it?

, It will take a long time, but once you're done writing your survival guide, have friends, teachers, and family members revise it. Look for spelling, grammar, and punctuation mistakes. They might even be able to add another story or topic for you to write about! This is kind of a boring step, but it's a necessary one if you want your survival guide to be epic!

, Once you're done this, your survival guide is pretty much done. It's probably easier to type out your survival guide, because you can choose a cool font and it's just easier to read, but if you want to write it out, that's good too. Either way, rewrite/retype it, and then print it out. This is your survival guide!

, You can really get creative with this. Draw a notebook, make a camouflage background...do whatever you want! Stick a title on there too. You can make your title generic, such as "Billy's Student Survival Guide", or make it creative, such as "Surviving School: The Ultimate Guide". Make it yours!

, If it's a project for school, turn it in knowing that you going to get a good grade on it. If it's a gift for friends/family, give it to them with pride. If you're going to try to get it published, your chances are going to be good! And if you made it simply for your own enjoyment...enjoy!

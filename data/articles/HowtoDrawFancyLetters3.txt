 This style has many similarities to standard cursive. Most of the letters are made with just one stroke as cursive is meant to be done with efficiency. The main strokes to learn are downward, upward, and curve strokes., Use lined paper, and start just above the bottom line. Curve down and to the right to the bottom line. When you touch the bottom line, stroke up to the top line moving from left to right., The letters b, f, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, and z all start with a downward stroke. Depending on the letter, you will have strokes that go to the top line, and some will only reach the middle line. The letter "f" will actually reach below the bottom line. These lines will flow from right to left., Put the tip of your pen right below the top line. Arc your pen down and around to the right, and bring the pen tip back to where you started. Finish the "O" with a curl to the right.
 Start with your pen tip on the bottom line. Draw an upward stroke to the middle line, and make a downward stroke that reaches to the bottom line and then, curves back up. Finish with another downward stroke and a small curl.Letters like i, j, m, n, r, v, w, and y have this stroke.
 Start with your pen tip on the bottom line, and stroke up to the top line. Then, arc your pen to the left, and draw a downward stroke to the bottom line so that you cross over your first line at the bottom. Make an upward stroke to the middle line, and another downward stroke back down to the bottom line finishing with an upward curl at the end.


Letters like b, f, k, and l have similar strokes.

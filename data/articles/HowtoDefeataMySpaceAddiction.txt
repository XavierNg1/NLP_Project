 This may be hard, but accepting that Myspace has taken over your life is an important step into overcoming your addiction. If you simply can't resist the urge to check your home page, then it's clear that Myspace is controlling you and not the other way around.;
, If you don't want to cut them off completely, consider just taking the friendships that you value off of Myspace. Get their phone numbers, email addresses, AIM screen names, ICQ numbers, or any other information that may be a way of contacting them outside of Myspace. (See Tips.)

, You've probably personalized it and tweaked it to reflect your personality. In a way, it's a work of art that you created. You don't want it to be lost forever, so save a copy in print. Having a hard copy will make it easier to let go of your profile online.
 Make it into a plain Myspace profile, like it was when you started it. End all blog subscriptions that you have signed up for. Turn off all of the e-mail notifications.
 Delete your main pictures, blog, comments, friends, and etc. If your profile is set to private, set it back to normal. Reset the information about yourself.
 Stop using Myspace. Get an e-mail filter and set it to block Myspace, Facebook, or any other similar sites.
 Try to find activities that both amuse you in the short-term and benefit you in the long-term. Myspace only provides a short-term pleasure (usually). Keep in contact with your friends through phone, e-mail, or messenger. Not talking to them may make you want to return to Myspace. After waiting a good month and re-establishing your life, go back and delete your Myspace. It shouldn't, at this point, rip your heart out to do so. Never go back to Myspace, as it will possibly trigger a relapse into the addiction again.

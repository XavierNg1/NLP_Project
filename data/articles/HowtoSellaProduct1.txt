It is absolutely vital to know your product inside out. If you do not know something a customer asks of you, try saying something like “I don’t know the exact answer for that, but I’ll be happy to look into it and get back to you right away. What’s the best way to contact you when I find the answer?”;
, As well as getting good product information to the right people, it is important to translate the product's features into benefits. This makes it easier for the customer to see why they should purchase the product. Think about things like:Will the product make the customer’s life easier?
Will the product create a sense of luxury?
Is the product something that can be enjoyed by many people?
Is the product something that can be used for a long time?

, If you are not doing direct, person-to-person sales, then you will need to ensure that good product information is supplied via retail packaging, point-of-purchase displays, and any marketing materials.Even if you are selling products directly or making a pitch, having good product information on display will help you convince customers.Make sure that all product information is informative, true, and complete.
Make sure that the language on product packaging and marketing materials is clear, direct, and easy to read.
Invest the time and money to ensure that your product, packaging, and marketing materials look good—high-quality photos, vivid colors, etc.

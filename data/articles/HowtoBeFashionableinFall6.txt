 A trendy scarf wrapped around your neck looks chic while protecting you against any chilly autumn breezes.
 There are many styles to choose from, including bucket hats, newsboy caps, and fedoras. Try on a few different styles until you find one that compliments the shape of your face. Once you find a style that works for you, look for one made of a heavier material, like wool or tweed.
 Small purses with dainty straps work better in the warmer seasons. Large shoulder bags with chunky straps look especially stylish in the fall and winter, since they coordinate more effectively with heavier knit clothing and boots.
 Gold tones are warmer than silver tones and match better with the browns, reds, and oranges commonly associated with fall.
 Look for necklaces with big, chunky beads in coral, red, or dark olive green. Consider chunky dangle bracelets in dark brown or orange. Jewelry can be used to add a splash of color to any outfit, regardless of the season.

 Iron your silk scarf on low to remove any wrinkles. Lay out your scarf so that the right side of the fabric is facing up. Fold the scarf in half diagonally so that it forms a triangle.
 Measure 20 centimeters down from the top of the triangle. Mark this distance with a chalk pencil. Place the top edge of a ruler on this mark so that it runs from one edge to the other edge of the scarf. Use your chalk pencil to draw a horizontal line along the top edge of the ruler from one edge to the other. Place four pins along the chalk line to secure the fabric in place., Thread your sewing machine or a needle. With your tool of choice, carefully stitch across the chalk line, removing the pins as you reach them. Flip the handkerchief right side out. Press the scarf with an iron set on low. The line of stitches you created in the scarf will now serve as the seam, or neckline.
 Measure and mark 2.5 centimeters down from the seam. Place the top edge of a ruler on this mark so that it runs from one edge of the scarf to the other edge. Use your chalk pencil to draw a second line along the top edge of the ruler. Insert pins to hold the fabric in place. With a sewing machine or needle, stitch across the chalk line to form a channel., Poke a safety pin through the end of your ribbon or cord. After closing the pin, slide it into the channel. Gradually work the pin through the channel, pulling the ribbon or cord with it. When the safety pin reaches the other end of the channel, adjust the ribbon or cord until it is centered. Remove the safety pin. Tie the ribbon or cord around your neck and the bias edge around your waist.

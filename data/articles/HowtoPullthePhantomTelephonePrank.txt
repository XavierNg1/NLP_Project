 Get out a tape recorder with a microphone on it and get an empty cassette tape. Also, you will need a cellphone to dial the person's home phone number.;
, Connect the phone back up.
, (Be very quiet so your noises won't be on the recording)

,, Make sure the answering machine is disconnected. The recorder will pick up the rings and record them.
 Hide it as close to the phone as possible.
 You will plug one into the power supply for the tape recorder. Make sure the play button is pressed down.


Run extension cords around the room and out where the victim won't see them.
Run one out to an outlet in a different room or take the one extension cord plugged into the recorder and take another extension cord and plug it into an outlet in the room of the recorder.



When plugged in the tape will play the ringing and make the victim think the telephone is ringing.
As soon as they get within 5 feet (1.5 m) of the phone disconnect the cords so the ringing stops!
When they leave and turn their back on the phone and they're about to do something else set off the phantom phone again.
Disconnect power again when they're 5 feet (1.5 m) within the phone.
 The phantom phone prank will drive them crazy!

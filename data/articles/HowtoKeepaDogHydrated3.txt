 Dogs can often get dehydrated when they are out for a long walk or running around outside during a play session. Long car trips can also make your dog thirsty, especially if it is a hot day. Pack bottled water or water jugs and your dog’s water bowl so you can provide fresh water for them on the go.Some dogs can be trained to drink from a squirt bottle. Try to get your dog used to drinking from a squirt bottle so you can bring it with you when you go on a walk or to a dog park. This will make it easier for you to squirt water into your dog’s mouth if they start to get dehydrated.
You can also purchase a portable, collapsible dog bowl to take with you on the go.
 Ice cubes are often a fun treat for dogs and can help them stay hydrated. Use ice cubes as a reward when your dog does a trick or follows an obedience command. Pack a cooler of ice cubes on a long trips and give them to your dog periodically to ensure they stay hydrated.To make the ice cubes more appetizing, you can try putting a dog treat in water in the ice cube tray and freeze it overnight. This way, your dog can lick the water, working their way to the treat inside the ice cube.
 Try not to keep your dog chained or tied up outside, especially on hot days. Dogs can end up wrapping their chain or leash around poles or trees, make it impossible for them to access their water bowls. Do not leave your dog tied up unattended for prolonged periods of time.If you do need to keep your dog contained, put them in their crate or kennel with access to a water bottle or a water bowl. This way, they will still be able to access fresh water.

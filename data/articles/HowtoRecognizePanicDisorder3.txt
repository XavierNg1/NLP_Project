Panic disorder can be triggered by stressful major events such as weddings, divorce, having children, graduating college, moving to a new place, beginning a new job or even suffering the death of a loved one.
Seek help from professionals such as psychiatrists or psychologists to learn how to deal with stress and major events that can trigger panic disorder.



Current health problems such as hypoglycemia, hyperthyroidism, brain abnormalities or substance abuse (including drugs or alcohol) may cause panic disorder.
Meet with a doctor or health professional if you think you suffer from these conditions.

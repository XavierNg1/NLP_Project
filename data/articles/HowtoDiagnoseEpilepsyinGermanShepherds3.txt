 Figures suggest that epilepsy is relatively common. Out of every 200 dogs, one is likely to have epilepsy, which is the equivalent of a 0.5% incidence.German shepherds are at increased risk, which means that in a group of 200 German shepherds, more than the expected one dog could have epilepsy.
 It is important to understand that epilepsy is a condition, whereas the terms seizures or fits are symptoms. Seizures or fits are also not a diagnosis in their own right. Many people inaccurately use the words epilepsy and seizures interchangeably, but this in incorrect.A dog with epilepsy has seizures, but a dog who has seizures does not necessarily have epilepsy. Seizures can be triggered by a variety of different reasons. This is an important distinction to grasp, when wondering if your German shepherd has epilepsy or not.
In order to reach a diagnosis and start the dog on appropriate treatment, your vet will want to rule out all causes of seizures or fits.
 Epilepsy is described as uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain for which no explanation is found. This makes epilepsy a "diagnosis of exclusion," which means that all other possible triggers for seizure activity have to be eliminated before a diagnosis of epilepsy can be made. This is only possible with exhaustive medical testing, including blood tests and an MRI scan to look at the structure of the dog's brain.As an owner, your first step is to recognize your dog is having seizures and take the dog to the vet.
You may have seen idiopathic epilepsy used when referring to the German shepherd. The word idiopathic means unknown cause, which is what epilepsy is, so strictly speaking, the word idiopathic is superfluous and not needed.

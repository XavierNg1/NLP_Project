 Lightly kick the ball out of your hands with the top of one foot. Lock your ankles. When your foot connects with the ball, the ball should connect with the "laces" part of your foot, or where the laces would be if you were wearing cleats. The ball should only go up a couple feet, with little or no spin.









Try connecting with your dominant foot first, and then alternate to your non-dominant foot. Skilled soccer players can kick the ball just as well with their non-dominant foot as they can with their dominant one.
 Now that you've practiced kicking while sitting down, it's time to practice while standing up. Again, try to kick the ball up only a couple feet, with little spin.









Stand up and do the same thing. Drop the ball over your foot and kick up gently. Practice your coordination here.
Again, look for no spin in the ball when you kick it up.

 The more you see him, the more your social interactions will escalate. The key is to make things feel like they happened organically.


The first time you see each other you will have an immediate physical attraction. The second time you see each other, you might smile at one another if the attraction is mutual. The third time you may finally start a conversation.Humans enjoy familiarity so the more you create a sense of familiarity, the more you create a sense of attraction.
 Location plays a role in developing an attraction because it can indicate shared interests. For example, if you are constantly seeing each other at the gym, it signals that you both keep fitness as a priority., Be careful not to overdo your interactions. It will quickly become obvious if you are going out of your way to see him. It also allows you to build intrigue and desire if you leave him wanting more after each interaction.
 In the initial stages of interaction, itâ€™s often difficult to know his schedule. Get on his radar once you know a little about his interests and schedule. Invite him to join you or inquire when he will be at a location next rather than relying on fait.You can also ask mutual acquaintances or drop hints as to where you will be to see if he picks up and joins you.
 Men enjoy the thrill of the chase. If you make it obvious that you will do anything to see him and hang on his every movement, you will be less attractive than if you present yourself as independent and mysterious. Feign surprise when you run into him, even if you had it planned.

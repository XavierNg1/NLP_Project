 If so, go to that house. Have that Sim invite your lost Sim over. If the lost Sim is busy, keep trying.;
, Shift click on your active Sim, and select "spawn". Then, select "more". Finally, select "simmodder".
 Click on it. Select “relationships”. Click "mutual with other". Then, select "loves".
 This is so that when the lost Sim moves in, all of their stuff is not sold. Realize that these two Sims are now in love. Have the Sim that is not lost propose move in.
 Make sure that if you do not want the other Sim to move in also, don’t select them to go along.
 Make sure to give the most money possible, cheating if you need to, to get the person back in good condition.

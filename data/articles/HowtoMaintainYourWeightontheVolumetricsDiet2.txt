 Fat has a high calorie density, and eating too much could cause you to gain weight.


Choose lean cuts of meat and other low-fat proteins.
Use lower-fat dressings, sauces and dairy products.
Bake, steam, grill or broil your food instead of frying it in oil or fat.
 Eat more sugar-modified foods, and drink calorie-free soft drinks.
 You can eat larger portions of low calorie density foods on Volumetrics, but stick to small portions of foods that are higher in calorie density, like fats and sugars.


Use food labels to determine your portion size. For instance, if the nutrition label says that 1 serving equals 1 cup, then place a portion equal to 1 serving on a plate.
Avoid eating out of the box or bag of food.
Eat slowly. You want your brain to get the message when your stomach is full.
Choose single-serving packaged snacks when you purchase snacks at the grocery store.
 Avoid snacking in front of the television set or while you are doing other tasks. Instead, chew your food slowly and enjoy its taste and texture.

 Iceberg lettuce is usually served alongside dishes like enchiladas and on tostadas, while green cabbage is the base of many slaw salads.;
, The exterior leaves on lettuce and cabbage tend to get damaged. The head should get fresher as you go inward.
, Pretend there is a nail on the cutting board and you are using the stalk as a hammer. Hit it with about that much force. This will break the stalk, and now the stalk will pull right out. Pull it out and throw it away in the compost.









Cabbage doesn't do so well with this method, so it will be much easier if you cut the head in half through the stalk to the top. Then cut the stalk out by cut along the outline of the shape of the thick wedges.
 Flip the head over so the hole from the stalk is facing the ceiling and chop the head in half vertically.
, Chop vertically only and slowly turn the half-head until you have chopped it all. If you don't want long strips, simply cut the pile in half horizontally. You can also lay the flat side down on your cutting surface and cut strips to desired thickness.

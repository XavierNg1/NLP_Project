 From working on your studies to finding lost items, do your best to try things on your own. Come up with different ways of tackling a problem, experiment, and see what works. Independence is not a lack of failure, but a willingness to keep trying.


If you've tried quite a bit and are still struggling, consider asking for help. A capable lady recognizes when she can use a hand, and isn't afraid to be assertive about it.;
, Taking good care of yourself is key for independence. Find a type of exercise you enjoy, get moving, eat a balanced diet, get enough sleep, and schedule yourself some relaxation time every day.
 Some women find they feel better and stand up straighter if they are well-dressed. Others enjoy casual clothes. Find styles that make you feel comfortable and confident.
 Being independent doesn't mean rejecting femininity, and you can be friends with guys without feeling the need to act like one. Girly girls and tomboys alike can be independent and strong. Follow your personal style, and don't let society push you to become someone you aren't.


If a guy doesn't like you for who you are, then he's not a good friend for you. Let the relationship fade. Don't try to change yourself for him.
Don't judge other women for being more or less feminine than you are. This is a style choice, not a value judgment.
 Being independent doesn't mean that you have to do everything on your own, and it's okay to get help with your schoolwork or let someone hold a door for you (regardless of whether you could have opened it yourself). It's okay to let people be nice to you.


Of course, if someone is being condescending about it, this isn't exactly "help," and you don't have to pretend to be pleased.

 Clockwise jumpers should start on a left back outside edge, and should reverse or mirror the rest of these directions.


Note that many jumpers find it difficult to simply start the jump from this position --- see the tips below regarding "Jump Preparation".;
, The left arm should be straight in front of you; the right arm should be extended at the "5 o'clock" position. Both palms should face downward.
 Plant the toe pick firmly in the ice, preferably just to the right of the arc of travel of your other blade. Be sure to reach back; you don't want to trip yourself.
 The rotation will come naturally. Do imagine using your left leg like a pole vault.






As the launch happens, both your legs will end up with knees straight. Pull your hands together towards your chest, but leave the upper arms and elbows extended to the 12-o'clock and 5-o'clock positions. (Imagine your arms are two blades of a pocketknife, and you're closing it.)






Rotate a full 360-degree revolution in the air. This is not as difficult as it seems, once you've properly launched the jump!







, As you land, extend your arms fully to the sides in normal skating position. Your right knee should be bent and your left leg extended strongly. Arch your back, keep good skating posture, and try to remain on the back outside edge. Smile broadly -- it contributes to your confidence level!

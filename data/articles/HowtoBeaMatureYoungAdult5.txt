 Make sure your clothes are not so tight that they are uncomfortable or risk tearing, and that they aren't so long that they drag on the ground or stretch past your fingers.
 Learn the dress code and recommended clothing for work, leisure, sports, and other activities.
 You can find good, inexpensive clothing at:


Outlet stores.
Thrift shops.
Vintage clothing retailers.
Online vendors.
Yard sales.



Wash white clothing as a separate load with bleach, then wash colored clothing with detergent. Washing white and colored clothing together can cause dye to stain white clothes.
Check your detergent for potential allergic reactions.
Iron wrinkled clothes and use collar stays to keep collars from curling.
Use strong hangers and learn to fold shirts and pants properly. Avoid wire hangers, as they can wear down clothes from the inside.

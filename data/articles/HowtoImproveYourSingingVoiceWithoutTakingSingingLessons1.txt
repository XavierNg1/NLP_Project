 Yes, practice your party dance groove motion. It might seem boring at first, but it really will help train your ear to recognize the right notes, making you a better singer. You're probably familiar with the song "Do Re Me" from The Sound of Music, which is actually a good song to practice with. The basis of this song is something called solfège, which is great for ear training.


In solfège, the notes in a scale are named by positional names, instead of the actual note names. This makes it easy to sing the notes, no matter what the key you're singing in. In the key of C, the first three notes are C, D, and E. In the key of F#, however, the first three notes are F#, G#, A#. In both cases, with solfège, the first three notes just happen to be, "Do, Re, Mi."
If you have a guitar or piano, use it to help guide you and make sure you're staying in tune. If not, you can use an online resource such as Virtual Piano to assist you.;
, Sing your "do re mi"s up and down the scales. Start with the C scale, then the C# scale, and on up. It looks like this, with solfège:


Basic scale: Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do

Then mix it up: go up two notes, and down one, working your way up the scale.
Up two, down one: Do Mi Re Fa Mi Sol Fa La Sol Ti La Do Ti Re Do

Start slowly and deliberately, and strive to hit the right note instead of sliding into it. This will help you get control of your voice, and you can use your instrument to make sure you're staying on pitch. It's much better to be very slow, and very accurate, than fast and sloppy.

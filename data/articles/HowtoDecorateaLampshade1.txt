 Some lampshades are easier to work with than others. When choosing a lampshade, consider the following:

Glue and paint sticks better to lampshades that are made fabric or paper than lampshades that are made out of plastic or glass.
Cone, box, or tube-shaped lampshades are easier to work with than domed or asymmetric lampshades.
Lampshades that have a smooth surface are going to give you more freedom than ones that already have a textured surface (such as being covered in beads, glitter, trim, or sequins).;
, Do you want to decorate the entire lampshade? Or do you just want to add a trim to the top and bottom? Get out a piece of paper and sketch out a few designs.

If you are having trouble coming up with a design, look at pictures of lampshades online or in a catalogue.
Consider basing your lampshade off of a certain theme, such as Asian, Mexican, tribal, nature, or holiday.
 If your have a dark colored lampshade and want to cover it with a light colored paper of fabric, some of that dark color might show through. This might not give you the result you want. To get a better finish in the end, paint your entire lampshade with a white primer. You can use spray paint, a foam roller, or a paintbrush. This will help the lighter colors on your paper or fabric show up better., For example, you can paint or cover your entire lamp with fabric first. Then, you can add a trim to it to give it a final touch.

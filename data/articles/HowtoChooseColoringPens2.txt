 The tip, or nib, of the pen controls how much ink is left on the page. Pens with traditional plastic tips leave thin, even lines. This makes them best for outlines and detailed coloring., Pens with felt tips function like markers. When held flat, they impart lots of color to fill in wide areas of paper. When held upright, the tips can be used for finer details. These tips use more ink and lose their shape faster.
 Pens can also come in a variety of tip sizes. A finer tip leaves small, precise lines and is good for detail work. Broad tips are good for thick lines and filling larger areas of paper. Medium tips are a combination of the two.


The definition of fine, medium, and broad tips differ between manufacturers due to the type of ink and tip used. For example, gel pens and plastic tips leave finer lines than marker pens and felt tips.
 Marker pens have tips similar to markers. While some varieties have finer tips, most have broader felt tips that allow you to fill in more space without running out of ink as quickly as when using a gel pen. These pens come up in all varieties of ink and are practical for beginners and professionals alike.


These pens put down a large amount of ink, which often bleeds through paper and colors the other side.

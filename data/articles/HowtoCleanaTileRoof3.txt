 Development of moss and other organic growths will vary, depending on the climate where you live. Once you see these growths start to appear on your roof, go through the cleaning process to remove them as soon as possible. Organic growths multiply quickly, so the faster you nip them in the bud, the better., Damaged tiles invite mold spores and mildew to grow on your roof more quickly than they would otherwise. Minor damage can become major and costly unless dealt with in a timely manner. Routinely inspect your roof for damage, especially after inclement weather. Replace and repair the tiles as needed., Immediately after you clean your tile roof is the perfect opportunity to strengthen it with a fresh coat of sealer, primer and paint. You donâ€™t need to do this each time you clean your roof, but keep this in mind and take the opportunity to do it every few years, immediately after a treatment.

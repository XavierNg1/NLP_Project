 If your problem gives you a measurement of the base and height of a parallelogram, simply multiply them to get your area. For example, if the base is 5, and the height 3, then your area is 15in2{\displaystyle 15in^{2}}, since 5∗3=15{\displaystyle 5*3=15}.The base is the length of the long, flat side on the bottom.

The height is the distance from the base straight up to its parallel side. 

Which side is the base and which is height is entirely up to you -- you could rotate any parallelogram to make any side the bottom and still get the same final answer.;
, A parallelogram consists of two sets of parallel lines, and one side is usually presented as the "bottom," making two of your sides appear flat. Measure this flat edge and write it down as the base, or "B."

For this example, assume the base has a length of 10cm.
 This must be a 90-degree angle so that your measurement for the height is perpendicular to the base. The easiest way to get this is to measure from the bottom corner straight up, using a ruler to line everything up.


You do not measure the height by measuring the slanted sides., As long as your line is perpendicular (at a 90-degree angle to the base, this is your height. Write it down for "H."

For this example, assume that the height is 5cm.

 The height may be drawn outside of the parallelogram.
 Once you've got your two measurements, simply add them to the equation A=B∗H{\displaystyle A=B*H}, where A stands for your area. Finishing the work:


A=B∗H{\displaystyle A=B*H}


B=10cm;H=5cm{\displaystyle B=10cm;H=5cm}




A=10cm∗5cm{\displaystyle A=10cm*5cm}


Area of Parallelogram=50cm2{\displaystyle =50cm^{2}}, In the previous example, you could leave the answer as "5." But this doesn't actually tell you how big the parallelogram is -- inches, miles, centimeters, etc. Since area is a measure of space, you need to tell the reader, teacher, or client how much space you measured. Since the problem above used centimeters, the final answer was "centimeters squared." This means that the parallelogram could fit "five perfect 1-centimeter squares" inside of it.

Simply square the units used to measure to get your answer. If you measured base and height in meters, your final answer would be in "meters squared," or "m2{\displaystyle m^{2}}"

If you have no measurements given, provide your answer in "units2{\displaystyle units^{2}}."

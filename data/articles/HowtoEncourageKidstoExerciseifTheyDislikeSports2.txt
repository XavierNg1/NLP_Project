 Play music in your house and encourage your kids to dance. If they begin to feel comfortable dancing, they may want to do it in an organized atmosphere. Also, dancing can improve their self-esteem and help build their rhythm if they ever want to learn an instrument. Get into the habit of playing music in the morning and dancing so that it becomes commonplace in your household., If your child doesn't like sports, they may feel more comfortable doing yoga in the house with you. On top of increasing their flexibility and keeping them physically fit, yoga also has mental benefits and can reduce stress and keep them centered. Look up yoga instructions online and involve your child into the sessions when you do them.Getting your kid their own yoga mat will give them a sense of responsibility and ownership over the exercise as well.
 You can create indoor or outdoor games to increase the child's physical activity. Games like freeze tag or indoor or outdoor obstacle courses are non-traditional ways they can get exercise. Think of different games that you can create and make fitness fun.Other activities you can encourage include jump rope, hopscotch, and hula hooping.
 Chores are a great way to get your kid outside. Choose tasks that involve physical activity like raking the leaves, cleaning the gutters, or mowing the yard. Even simple chores like taking out the trash, walking the dog, or bringing the mail into the house involve physical activity.

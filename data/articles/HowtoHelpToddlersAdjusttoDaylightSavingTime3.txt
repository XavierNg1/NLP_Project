 One of the best ways that you can help toddlers adjust to daylight savings time is to prepare in advance for the change. Planning ahead helps you in several ways.For example, it helps you adjust your own schedule, make any environmental changes, and make other preparations for the time change.


Make a list of any materials you need to purchase. For example, high wattage light bulbs, blackout curtains or shades, or an alarm.
Set reminders on your agenda or calendar to help you remember the changes you need to make to your own schedule. For example, you might set a reminder to start dinner earlier.
Plan ways to make the transition easier for your toddler. For example, pick a few books that are a bit longer than usual to read during the week before daylight savings time ends.
 Change of any kind is hard for young children. You can help make the adjustment to daylight savings time easier by making it a gradual change.Adjust toddlers’ schedule forward or back a little each day rather than have them adjust to the time change all at once.


Try not to adjust their schedule more than 15 to 20 minutes each day.
Start the week or so before time changes so that if one of the nights doesn’t go well, you can try again at the same time the next night. For example, if your toddler was supposed to go to bed at 7:50 pm on Monday night, but didn’t until 8:10 pm, you can try for 7:50 pm again on Tuesday.
 Adjusting to time change can be difficult for everyone, including adults. Even with the changes that you put in place, adjusting to daylight savings time may be challenging for your toddler.Be patient and understanding with toddlers during the days immediately after a time change. Toddlers may still need a little time and support adjusting to the change.


Try saying things like, “This time change is difficult for everyone. We’ll get used to it!”
Or, you might say, “I know you feel grumpy. You’re still getting used to waking up at this time. Don’t worry, it’ll get easier.”

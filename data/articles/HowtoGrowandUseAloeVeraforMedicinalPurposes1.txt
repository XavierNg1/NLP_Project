 Purchase a small plant from a garden store and then repot it in a larger container. If you care for the plant properly, it will thrive and produce plenty of aloe for medicinal use.


Choose a wide container to repot your aloe plant since aloes tend to produce offshoots, or baby aloe plants.;
, The most important point to remember while using soil for growing Aloe vera plants is that the soil should be moderately fertile and fast draining, as the plant itself contains a lot of water and will wilt if the soil is not fast draining. Use a good quality commercial propagation mix or pre-packaged "cacti and succulent mix" as they allow good drainage., If you prefer to keep the plant inside, place in a window for maximum sunlight. If you are in mild climatic conditions, take care to provide enough direct light. Artificial light may be used if you do not have much sunlight in your region.In areas that receive frost or snow the species is best kept indoors or in heated glasshouses.
 Stick your finger into the dirt to determine if you plant needs to be watered. Allow the first 1-2 inches of soil to dry out completely between waterings. Since aloe vera plants are native to dry, hot regions, they can survive droughts, but the plants will be more likely to thrive if watered every few days.Water your aloe vera plants less in the winter, since the plants will drain more slowly. Over watering can cause rot to form, which may kill your plant.
 When potted aloe plants become crowded with baby plants growing from the sides of the mother plant, they should be divided and re-potted to allow room for further growth and help prevent pest infestations.


You will have to completely remove your aloe plant from its pot to find these baby plants. Use sharp scissors or a knife to sever them from the mother plant.
Repot the mother plant when you are finished and transfer each of the baby plants to their own pot.

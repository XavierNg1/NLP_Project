 Add ¾ cup (177 ml) of extra virgin olive oil, 1 cup (240 ml) of red wine vinegar, 2 teaspoons (6 g) of garlic powder, 2 teaspoons (4 g) of dried oregano, 2 teaspoons (4 g) of dried basil, 1 ½ teaspoons (3 g) of black pepper, 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt, 1 ½ teaspoons (5 g) of onion powder, 2 teaspoons (10 g) of dijon style mustard, and the juice from ½ a lemon to the pitcher of a blender. Secure the lid on the pitcher.If you don’t have a blender, you can combine the ingredients in a bowl and whisk them together. You can also add them to a jar with a lid and shake to combine them.
 Once all of the ingredients are in the pitcher, turn the blender on. Blend the ingredients for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the vinaigrette is fully mixed.The finished dressing should have an opaque yellowish tan color.
 When you’re finished blending the vinaigrette, pour it into a lidded jar or other covered container. Store in the refrigerator for use within a week.The vinaigrette can sometimes thicken when it’s refrigerated. To thin it out, let it sit for 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature or warm it in the microwave for 15 seconds.

 The two main sources of money you’ll earn will come from (1) stage dances and (2) lap dances. The term lap dance, table dance, private dance, and personal dance can all be used interchangeably.
 Your first source of income will be from stage dances. This is the money you collect after you’ve performed on stage. You should try to collect tips from everyone sitting on and in very close proximity to your stage and who might have seen you dance. Because most dance sets are made up of two 3.5 minute long songs, the club will have approximately eight girls dancing per hour. Keep in mind that there is at least a 30 second interval between dancers, so there is a chance that only seven girls will go up on stage per hour/per stage. Depending on how many stages there are in your club, how many girls are on the rotation schedule, and how many customers there are, you’ll most likely make between $10 and $50 per stage show., Most lap dances are between $10 and $20 per dance, so the key to making a lot of money is to keep your customer buying dances from you once you’ve already got him in your chair. The best thing to do is make your lap dance the most seductive during the last 30 seconds. When you can hear the song starting to end, ask your customer if he wants you to continue. If you’ve done it right, he’ll want more!, Taking the money you make off stage dances and adding it to the money you can make by getting customers to buy lap dances from you, you can make between $80 and $100 an HOUR. Of course, this amount may vary… some nights you’ll make more and some nights you’ll make less, but this is the average you should expect.

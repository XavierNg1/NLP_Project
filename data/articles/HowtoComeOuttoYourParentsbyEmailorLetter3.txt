 Pay attention to how your parents respond to LGBTQ issues in the news. Take note if they make homophobic remarks or talk negatively about issues like marriage equality and adoption. Getting a feel for their basic outlook can help you anticipate how they’d react if and when you come out to them.When and if you do tell them, understand that your parents might feel shocked, sad, angry, guilty, or afraid. Try to respect their emotional response, and have faith that their emotions can change over time.
 In a perfect world, no one would have to live in the closet. However, your safety should be your number one concern. If one or both of your parents have ever threatened to harm you or any member of the LGBTQ community, consider holding off until you know you can come out safely.For instance, if you really need to be honest with them but are concerned about your safety, you could wait until you live on your own or are otherwise out of harm’s way before sending them your letter.
 In addition to physical safety, take your financial well being into account when deciding how, when, and if you should come out. If you live at home or depend on your parents financially, it might be in your best interest to come out when you’re financially independent.Ask yourself, “Do my parents make homophobic comments or otherwise indicate that they wouldn’t accept me for who I am? Would they continue to let me live at home, or pay for my college? What are my options if they kicked me out of the house?”

, Before coming out to your parents, identify family, friends, and anyone else you can trust, like counselors or teachers. If you think you might need a place to stay, ask someone to stay with them for a little while. At the very least, having someone else to listen and lend emotional support will help you get through a difficult coming out process.

 Nvidia drivers are not automatically installed when you use Ubuntu. Instead, Ubuntu uses open-source drivers which aren't as powerful. You can install the Nvidia drivers through the Additional Drivers window.


Launch the Dash and type "drivers" to open the Additional Drivers window.
 This may take a few moments.
 Make sure it is the driver from Nvidia, and not the "Nouveau" driver. Select the driver to begin downloading the files.
 The Nvidia driver will be installed. Your screen may flicker or shut off during the installation process.
 Reboot your computer to complete the installation process.

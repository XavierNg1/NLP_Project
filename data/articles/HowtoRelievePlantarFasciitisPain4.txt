 A common way to relieve pain from plantar fasciitis is to take over-the-counter pain medication. You can use OTC anti-inflammatory medications to help decrease the inflammation and the pain in your foot. These medications include Ibuprofen, such as Advil and Motrin, and Naproxen, like Aleve.Use the medication only as directed on the package. You can take these medications for up to two weeks.
 If you have plantar fasciitis pain that doesn’t respond to any of the home treatments, you may want to see your doctor. Your doctor may suggest corticosteroids if you have pain that just won’t go away. Usually, these injections work better if done early; however, doctors usually only administer them in more severe cases.Your doctor will probably suggest other at-home methods before giving you these injections.
Multiple shots are not recommended. This can weaken your plantar fascia or diminish the pad that covers your heel bone.
Before you get an injection, you will have to get a radiograph of the food.
 In the most severe cases where the pain doesn’t decrease and the plantar fascia doesn’t heal with other treatments, a physician may suggest surgery. In the surgery, a surgeon will release your plantar fascia from the heel bone. This is the last resort option for pain.If you undergo this surgery, you may end up with a weakened foot arch.

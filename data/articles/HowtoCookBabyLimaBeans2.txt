 Take the two pounds or a ten-ounce package of fresh beans out of the packaging. The frozen package is lighter because the beans have already been shelled. Make sure there isn’t any debris mixed in with the beans. Then, use a colander to wash the beans under cold water. Drain any excess water out of the bowl., Put two cups (473.2 mL) of water in the saucepan. Add ½ tablespoon (2.47 mL) of salt to the water. Pour the beans into the pan., Cook the beans until they are tender. Stir the beans around occasionally so that they don’t stick. This should take about thirty minutes., Drain the excess liquid from the saucepan when the beans are finished cooking. Add two tablespoons of butter to the beans. Stir the beans slightly so that the butter mixes in., Add ¼ tablespoon of coarse ground pepper to the beans. You can then remove the beans from the saucepan. Serve the beans at whatever temperature you prefer.

 Be prepared if your classrooms get cold by layering a cardigan or a jacket over your top. With sweaters, opt for a softer knit for maximum comfort.
 Try a stack of colorful bangles or a couple layers of necklaces. Jewelry is a great way to personalize your outfit - just don't overdo it.
 Backpacks don't have to be boring. Choose one in a bright, stand-out color. A roomy messenger bag can be a stylish alternative to a backpack.

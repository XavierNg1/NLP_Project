Only go through the rock things if flames aren't coming out of them.
If you have to, spin the Lil Cinders and go through them to get rid of them. You won't get coins though.;
, Watch where you go!


Do not touch the fire that is going from one fireball to another fireball (should be in Freezeflame Galaxy).
Collect Star Chips near the end of the level. Watch for flames and Lil Cinders.
 Hop through the rocks before they sink into the lava. The lava spire starts to sink after the cutscene.


Avoid wasting time to get rid of Lil Cinders, spin crystals with star bits inside or anything else tempting to stop you.
 You cleared the level.

,,,, It will turn white, and Siri will no longer read your notifications out loud when VoiceOver is enabled.


This button is called “Speak Notifications” in earlier iOS versions.
If you find that you inadvertently enable VoiceOver at times, you may have it set as the triple-click Accessibility Shortcut that is activated by clicking the Home button three times. If you’d like to disable this feature, tap the back arrow and scroll down to the bottom of the Accessibility menu. Tap Accessibility Shortcut and uncheck VoiceOver.

 You can use other greases and oils too, but those are not usually intended for metal and result in the metal of the hinge degrading over time. Gun oil is best, since it is designed for use on metal.
 You want to avoid having to take the door completely off the hinges, so just remove one hinge pin at a time and don't remove it the whole way. You just need access to the first inch or two. Do this by tapping the bottom of the pin with a screwdriver and hammer until the pin pops up.


You may need a helper or something to prop up the door with if it becomes unstable with the hinges partway out.
 With part of the hinge pin exposed, brush on a little of the gun oil with an old paintbrush or a cloth. It doesn't take much, so don't make a mess!

, Tap the hinge pin back into place and work the door back and forth so that the oil works its way down. Clean up any extra with a piece of tissue.
 Do each of the hinges in turn until they're all fixed.

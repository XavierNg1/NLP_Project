Long shank and Tangle thorn are top choices because they’re fast refresh staple attacks that don’t rely on any particular damage type.
Blazing Thrust is another good fast-refresh attack that’s a great upgrade option.
Culling the Herd and Triple Fire should be your first choices for bow skill upgrades, followed closely by Storm of Arrows, which is a fantastic high-damage AE bow attack that really benefits from the upgrade to adept III. It is devastating in a group where you are fighting many multiple mob encounters.
 These will guide you to come up with the best deals on these products.

 This is called a “child” account.;
,


If the user already has a “child” account, you won’t need to create a new one. Instead, edit the child account’s web restrictions at account.microsoft.com/family. You’ll learn how later in this method.
, The new child user must have an email addresses that ends in @outlook.com, @hotmail.com or @live.com.


If the child has a Microsoft email address, type it into the blank, click “OK,” then “Confirm.”
If the child does not have a Microsoft email account, click “The person I want to add doesn’t have an email address.” Type a new email address and password for the child account, then click “Next.”

, When signing in, you'll need the child’s username and password. You’ll see a message in the inbox that says, “You need a parent’s permission.”

,, Your card will be charged $.50 by Microsoft. There’s no way around this. Enter the information, click “Next,” then “Confirm.”

, You’ll see a list of accounts associated with your “Family” on the far right side of the screen.
 When the menu appears, select “Web browsing” from the list.
 In the “Web browsing” menu, flip the switch by “Block inappropriate websites” to “On.” This will block adult content and enable SafeSearch to filter the child’s search results.
 Some websites, like those about gender or medical issues, may be inappropriately blocked by the filters. If you know of a site you want your child to be able to access, regardless of filters, type the address into the box beneath “Always allow these.” Click “Allow” to add the site to the list.
 If you want to block access to a certain website (such as Facebook), type the address of the website below “Always block these.” Click “Block” to add it to the block list.”

, Your child will only be protected by your web browsing filters when logged into the child account. If the child accesses the Internet from a different account (including yours), they will bypass the filters completely.

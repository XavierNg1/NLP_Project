 Tuna typically follow warm water currents, which may be just 5 mi (8 km) or more than 100 mi (161 km) offshore in different years.;
, After arriving at the warm water current frequented by tuna, the fish finder tells you where in the current the fish are and what their depth is.
 Once you find a school of tuna, the chum slick brings them near the boat. Use a liquid chum dispenser and a fish-attracting oil formulated for attracting tuna. You can also chum with live bait.
 You need to add the right size hook and egg sinker, a lead weight, to weigh the line down so the hook will sink when you pull out the line.


Bait your hook with anchovies, sardines, pieces of squid or other small fish. Each kind of bait has to be threaded on the hook in a specific way. Ask a more experienced angler to show you how to bait your hook.
Add a feather jig to your hook. This is a lure that resembles a small fish. The feathers attached to the back mimic fins and a tail, and conceal the hook.
 Pull out your line until your hook is at the same depth as the tuna and lock your reel.



Check your bait after approximately 10 minutes if you don't get a bite. Your bait might have fallen off or been taken by a fish who didn't get hooked in the process.
Begin jigging. Let the jig sink to the right depth, then pull it up. The fish will most likely strike the hook as it's sinking.
 If you try to set the hook too soon, you may jerk it out of the tuna's mouth, letting it escape.
 Keep the proper tension on your line so it doesn't break. Pull the tuna toward you as you brace yourself against the rail, then reel in the slack.

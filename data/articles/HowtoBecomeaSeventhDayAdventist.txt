Follow Christ in Baptism: Be baptized is by immersion after you have been taught the gospel, and believe in Christ as Lord and Savior, repent of all sins, and make confession (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; Romans 6:1-6; 10:10; Colossians 2:12).
Expect the Second Coming: Realize that Christ, the Great High Priest in heaven, is now bringing to a close His work as the one mediator between God and man, and soon He will return to this earth in power and great glory. His coming will be literal, personal, and visible to all (John 14:1-3; Acts 1:11; Matthew 24:30; Luke 21:27-31; Revelation 1:7; Daniel 7:8-14; Hebrews 8:1,2; 4:14-16; Revelation 14:6-20).



Keep the Sabbath: The fourth commandment of the Decalogue requires the observance of the "seventh-day Sabbath", which is a memorial of Creation and a sign of sanctification (Genesis 2:1-3; Exodus 20:8-11; Ezekiel 20:12; Luke 23:56).
 Man receives immortality and eternal life as a gift from God only through his faith in Christ (Job 4:17; 1 Timothy 6:16; Romans 6:23; 2 Timothy 1:10).


Read the Bible concerning Death: Man's condition in death is one of unconsciousness. The dead, both good and evil, remain in the grave until the resurrection. None go to heaven or hell at death (Ecclesiastes 9:5,6,10; John 5:28,29; 1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; 1 Corinthians 15:51-53).
Avoid hell: Hell will be a real lake of fire where all sinners will be burned up, utterly destroyed, and cease forever to exist (Malachi 4:1-3; Revelation 20:14; Psalm 37:20; 2 Thessalonians 1:9).



Pay tithe: Tithe in the support of the gospel through tithes and offerings (Malachi 3:8-11; Matthew 23:23; 1 Corinthians 9:9-14).
Live healthfully: The follower of Christ should regard his body as the temple of the Holy Spirit and therefore abstain from all intoxicating beverages, tobacco, coffee, unclean meats, and every soul-defiling habit and practice (1 Corinthians 3:16,17; 9:25; 10:31; Proverbs 23:29-32; Deuteronomy 14:3-20).
Uphold Christian standards: The followers of Christ should manifest true Christian modesty in dress and deportment and should shun all questionable worldly amusements such as the theater and dance (1 Timothy 2:9,10; Matthew 24:37-44; James 1:27; 2 Timothy 3:4,5).

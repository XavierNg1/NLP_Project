 To give first aid to a child older than twelve months, sit or stand behind them and place an arm diagonally across their chest. Lean the child forward slightly, so they are resting against your arm. With the heel of your free hand, administer five firm and distinct blows to the child's back, directly between the shoulder blades. If this does not dislodge the object, move on to abdominal thrusts., An abdominal thrust - also known as the Heimlich maneuver - works by forcing the air out of a person's lungs, in attempt to clear any obstructions from the airways. It is safe to perform on a child older than a year.To administer an abdominal thrust:


Stand or sit behind the choking child and wrap your arms around their waist.
Make a fist with one hand and place it firmly on the child's stomach, thumb side in, slightly above the belly button.Wrap your other hand around the fist and deliver a quick upward and inward thrust to the child's abdomen. This motion should force air and any lodged objects out of the windpipe.For smaller children, be careful not to thrust against the breastbone, as this could cause injury. Keep your hands just above the navel.Repeat up to five times.
 If the child is still choking after five back blows and five abdominal thrusts, repeat the entire procedure again and continue to do so until the object becomes dislodged, the child starts coughing, crying or breathing, or emergency services arrives., If the child still cannot breath and loses consciousness, you will need to perform modified CPR as quickly as possible.

 It is much easier to catch the infection from somebody else's Pokémon than it is to find it yourself. If this doesn't work, move on to the next step.;
, The only way to get the Pokérus is from another infected Pokémon, and if you don't have any friends who have infected Pokémon, there is a very, very slight chance that a wild Pokémon will have it.
 The nurse will tell you if your Pokémon is infected. The Pokémon Center cannot cure the Pokérus, so don't worry about losing it that way.
 Put other Pokémon in your party with the infected one, and save one infected Pokémon on your PC, in case you ever want to start another epidemic.
, After you tell them what the Pokérus does, they should be willing to give you some pretty awesome stuff for it.

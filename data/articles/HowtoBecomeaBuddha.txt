 This includes reading books, attending Buddhist community events, browsing forums, asking questions, propitiating the religious community, the immaculate Buddha, and all the holders of the Dharma. Perfect beings don't need to teach you, so you have to ask them to teach you. Mahayana Buddhists are bound by compassion to teach you. Essentially, prepare yourself as a vessel into which the teachings can be poured. The perfect vessel to receive the teachings has 3 qualities: 1) It is not already full or upturned. One must give up pride in what one already knows in order to receive the teachings and willing to receive teachings. 2) It is not dirty. One must not try to mix the teachings with what is already in the vase. This will only lead to confusion. 3) It is not broken. Remember what is taught, otherwise the teachings fall straight through the vase.;
, Don't simply accept the teachings, investigate them thoroughly. Always consider the teachings in their context and try to clarify all doubts and misconceptions you have. This can be done, again, by reading associated material, visiting discussion forums and asking true Buddhist Masters.
 The teachings are a vehicle for you to achieve lasting peace and happiness. They are not a means for themselves. Accumulating teachings and not integrating them into your life is like baking a cake and not eating it. Without meditation, the subtle points will be missed and realizations will not arise.

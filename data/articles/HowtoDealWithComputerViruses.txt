 There are plenty of viruses being transmitted through software and from online and some are more detrimental than others. In addition, there are plenty of viruses yet to be thought up, so being aware and prepared is better than trying to cure them. Some of the more commonly known viruses include:


File infection virus
Boot sector virus
Worms
Trojan horse;
, There can be a number of reasons besides viruses as to why your computer has slowed down, frozen, or is doing strange things. For example, your machine might not have been turned off for a while and as a result, is running too many programs, has cached too much information, and is sluggish. Or, you might have opened too many programs at once, etc. To identify the presence of a virus, try this:


See if the task manager is disabled.
See if the auto play is enabled when connecting to the flash drive.
Check to see if your system is slow.
Check to see if your operating system won't respond to commands, or crashes.
Have you noticed any funny messages when starting up?

, These can detect viruses your anti-virus may miss.
 Use a reputable, recommended anti-virus software or rush your computer to your local trusted computer repair person (some even visit if you're lucky).

 If you want the flower to look more dynamic, make sure that each piece of paper is a different color. Pick colors that will look good together, like red, purple, and yellow. If you pick colors that are too similar, like dark blue and purple, then they'll blend in together. For a more sturdy flower, you can use construction paper, and for a more loose, flowing flower you can use origami paper.
 Cut a large and small-sized flower from every paper. Follow the same or a similar design for each flower. You can just cut an ordinary flower with four or five petals. If you create three stencils in advance, you can use them to trace the same two shapes onto each paper.









When you're done, just combine a large and small flower of a different color, placing the large flower below the small flower. Fan out the petals so they don't overlap too much. You should have three flowers made of two different colors.
 First, create a small hole in the center of the flowers using a very thin pair of scissors or a pin. Stick the pipe cleaner through so that a very small amount, less than 1/2 an inch (~1.3cm) is sticking out through the top of the flower. The pipe cleaner will be the stem of the flower, so you can pick a fun color that will look nice with the petals.









To keep the pipe cleaner in place in the center of the flower, you can bend the top so it's too big to go back through the hole, or attach a bead or a button so the flower doesn't come off.
 Pick a floral perfume to make the paper flowers smell like real flowers. Make sure to spray it far enough away so you don't end up soaking the flowers.
 Create a nice bouquet with the flowers and place them in a brightly-colored vase. If they look lonely, make some more flowers to keep them company.

 It does not matter which point is above or below the other point, just so long as you keep the two points separate.
Learn that the Standard Form for the equation of a Line in the Cartesian Plane is: Ax + By = C. Here, one finds the intercepts with the axes by setting first x equal to 0, then y = to 0.
Learn that the Slope-Intercept Form for the equation of a Line in the Cartesian Plane is: y = mx + b, where m = slope and b = the intercept with the y-axis.;

Slope Intercept Equation of vertical and horizontal lines

Vertical Lines
The Equation of a vertical line is either x = b or x = k, some constant.
Since a vertical line goes straight up and down, its slope is undefined. Also, the x value of every point on a vertical line is the same. Therefore, whatever the x value is, is also the value of 'b', and the line intersects the y-axis. However, if x = k, the vertical line most probably does not intersect the y-axis (unless k=b).


Horizontal Lines

The equation of a horizontal line is y = b where b is the y-intercept.
Since the slope of a horizontal line is 0, the general formula for the slope-intercept form equation, y = mx + b, becomes y= 0x +b, or y = b. Also,since the line is horizontal, every point on that line has the exact same y value. This y-value is therefore also the y-axis intercept.
 Determine which Form the equation is in (the answer is in the Tips Section below).

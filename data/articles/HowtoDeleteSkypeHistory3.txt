 Skype for mobile is synchronized with your computer version of Skype, so changes to one will affect the other. Start by deleting your Skype history from your computer. Find your operating system in the sections above and follow the instructions in its section.
 The precise way to do this will vary based on your device. Usually, the process is similar to this:


Open your mobile Settings menu from the list of apps (it generally has a gear icon).
Select the "Apps" option, then scroll through the list and select Skype.
Some systems may require you to tap and hold down on the Skype icon and select "Settings." Others may have a Settings menu hidden in a swipe-down menu on the main screen.
 This should remove all of your conversation history from your device. If you are asked to confirm your choice, tap "OK" or the equivalent option. You may need to re-enter your login details the next time you launch Skype.


Note that some users report that this also clears your Skype address book for your device.You may need to re-sync with the computer version or re-enter contacts manually.

 Nook is the raccoon who runs the item shop in Animal Crossing. The first incarnation is called Nook’s Cranny. This shop will be upgraded over time. It does not matter what level your shop is; you will be able to use cheat codes at it. Find the shop on your map and enter!;
, Speak with Tom Nook by pressing “a”. He’ll ask you what you want; choose “other things” and then choose “say code”. This takes you to a text screen where you input codes to your fancy! Repeat this process for every code that you have/want. Again, many codes can be found online.


A sample code for the Golden Axe is as follows: 4B2&p%eGcglO7NHZCS3hjkKJtlgH - the Golden Axe never breaks, making it a great advantage to have if you’re interested in changing up the landscape of your town.
As you can see, the code is a bit difficult, so it will require careful entry. If you make a mistake, an error will come back saying that no item was obtained.
 Using game cheats is a really simple process overall. To recap: find Nook in his shop, talk to him, choose “other things” and then “say code” in order to reach the text box for input. Put in a code, and enjoy your new item! Rinse and repeat to your heart’s desire.
 There are limitations to using cheat codes in Animal Crossing, which could cause you to run into issues if you attempt to exceed those limitations.


You can only use three codes per day. You must wait 24 hours before you put in more codes. So if, for example, you use the codes for the golden shovel, golden axe, and golden bug net, that is all you will be able to get that day.
If you try to put in the code for the golden fishing rod, you will receive an error. You must wait 24 hours before you can redeem any more codes.
 Animal Crossing can be played many ways, and the cheat codes provide the opportunity for you to use certain shortcuts.


For example, if you don’t want to invest a lot of time in farming bells, then go ahead and use the code for 30,000 bells until you have as much money as you want (but remember that you can only redeem 3 codes per 24 hours).
If you want those golden tools early on in the game to make things easier, go ahead and grab those. If you want a really nice looking house and don’t have the time to grab all the furniture yourself, use all the codes for the set.
 Although most items can be obtained in game through a bit of work, the game doesn't penalize you at all for making things a little easier on yourself. As a result, there's no need to feel guilty about using these codes - feel free to cheat away!

, All of the golden tools can be obtained other ways through the game. For example, you would receive the golden bug net by catching all of the bugs possible in the game. That, however, can take a lot of time and effort, so if you want to speed things up, use these codes:


To obtain the Golden Net, follow the steps above and enter this code: 4B2&p%eGcglO7NHZCS3hjkKJtlgH - the Golden Net swings sideways, instead of just up and down, making it easier to catch bugs. A great tool to get to catch all those bugs.

Golden Shovel: GkUFUvirg%PX6a3ZizGfw5dTZLQh - the Golden Shovel has a random chance of digging up some bells!

, Aside from tools, you can enter codes in Nook's Shop to receive extra money you can use to buy things. For example:


To receive 30,000 Bells, tell Tom Nook the following code: WB2@pAR%hTk8JHyrT - extra bells can be nice if you’re having a hard time farming them otherwise in the game. You can use this code multiple times to keep getting payouts of 30,000 bells, making this an easy way to accumulate cash.
There’s also a code for 10,000 bells: Wn2&SAVAcglC7N POudE2Tk8JHyUH


, Animal Crossing contains a lot of different furniture pieces. Some of these are only available for collection on special event days or holidays.


Having a complete furniture set in your home is important, as it will earn you extra points with the Happy Home Academy (they give you ratings based on your décor).
If you miss those, or don’t have the time to invest in participating in the events in order to collect all the furniture, here are codes for a few of the sets.
 The harvest set is an autumn-themed collection of furniture. You can get it using the following codes:

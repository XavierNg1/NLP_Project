 Before you stop birth control, schedule a pre-conception visit with your doctor. If you are up to date on your annual exams (e.g. Pap smear, breast exam), this visit generally won't involve a physical or gynecological exam. Your doctor will inquire about your lifestyle habits, medical history, and gynecological history, and may provide advice on how to conceive., Once you decide to conceive, start adjusting your lifestyle habits to prepare for pregnancy. If you're a smoker, work on quitting the habit before trying to conceive. Start getting regular, low impact exercise (e.g. jogging) and move away from fitness activities that pose a high risk of falling or injury (e.g. mountain biking).Cut caffeine down to two servings a day, and begin eating a more well-balanced diet.
 As soon as you decide to conceive, start taking folic acid supplements. Folic acid decreases the risk of miscarriage and birth defects, but you must start taking it one to two months prior to conception for it to be successful. Buy either 400mg or 600mg tablets at your local pharmacy, to be taken once a day.For best results, start taking folic acid a month before you stop using birth control.
 Plan for pregnancy as an imminent possibility before stopping your birth control, whether it be discontinuing your contraceptive pills or having an IUD removed. While it could take months to conceive after halting contraceptive measures, it is also possible that you will get pregnant right away. If you want more of an adjustment period before conception (e.g. to plan for things financially), wait to stop birth control until you are absolutely ready.

 If a bank measures a combined balance of multiple accounts, then it is already using a system of linking your accounts together. If this has not been suggested, you may wish to ask about it when setting up your account. Find out if you can link a savings or retirement account to your checking account, and thereby avoid paying maintenance fees. Some banks will even let you avoid paying fees if you have your mortgage or other significant loan with them., Ultimately, banks make money by holding your savings. If you set up a direct deposit for your paycheck, the bank will be able to count on that regular source of income. Many banks offer programs that eliminate fees if you establish a direct deposit account with them.You may need to ask about the direct deposit feature for avoiding fees when you open your account. It may not be evident unless you ask about it.
 If you use your bankâ€™s online bill paying features, you can often avoid minimum balance fees. Even if you use the online bill paying as infrequently as once a month, many banks will credit this and will not charge the maintenance fees., Find someone you can trust to share an account with. If the two of you combine your money, you will each have an easier time maintaining a minimum balance.


The bank will consider the account to be a single account. You and your friend will need to develop a system of managing the account between yourselves, so you each know how much of the money belongs to each of you. If you can do this, you should have an easier time meeting the minimum balance.

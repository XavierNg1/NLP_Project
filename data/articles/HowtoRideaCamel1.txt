 Camels have an odd, side-to-side gait that causes a lot of friction if you aren't prepared. And the last thing you want is rough, straw-like camel hairs grinding up and down your soft legs. Your socks should come up as high as you can get them since the motion often hikes your pants up uncomfortably. Other clothing essentials include:


A hat and sunglasses to protect your face from the sun.
A long scarf or bandanna to protect your face in case of a dust storm.
Dust goggles, especially if the forecast hints at possible storms.;
, Don't look it in the eyes if you're nervous. Just stride up to it purposefully, coming from a diagonal angle. Unless you're a pro or have help, you're only going to mount the camel if the beast is sitting.


With most guides and groups, the chance of agitating a camel is pretty low. However, there is no reason to take unnecessary risks., Getting on the camel is the hardest part of riding. Do it quickly, using your momentum as a guide. There is usually a stirrup on one side for your foot. Step up on this stirrup and get your other leg over and around.


You want to be straddling the camel to keep your balance as you start riding. Once the camel stands up you can then move your legs to get more comfortable.
There will be a handle on the front of the saddle to help you hold on as you get up.
Some people actually mount by "leapfrogging" from behind the camel. Trust your guide's judgement if he/she suggests this â€” they know their animals best., Camels stand up with their back legs first. If you're not careful, they'll throw you face first into their necks. Hold onto the saddle and lean back to counteract the camel's motion.
 Once it has sure footing with the back legs, it will move to the front. Slowly lean forward as the camel pushes up so that you end up with your back straight.

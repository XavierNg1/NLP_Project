 Loop one end of the rubber band around your index finger. Loop the other end of the rubber band around your thumb on the same hand. Position your hand so that your thumb and index fingers are pointing straight up.
 Point your other index finger straight up, and insert it into the gap in the rubber band from underneath. Press your index finger into the side of the rubber band, at about the midpoint. If you’re using your right index finger, press it into the right side of the rubber band, and vice versa if you’re using your left index finger. The rubber band should look like a triangle between your two index fingers and thumb.
 Allow the rubber band to slip off of the index finger where you originally placed it. It should now be between your thumb on one hand and index finger on the opposite hand. The rubber band will be more taut on the side where you inserted your second index finger. This makes the rubber band more aerodynamic when shot.
 Point your index finger with the rubber band around it at your target to aim. Don't allow your finger to bend as this will cause the rubber band to slip down. The rubber band should rest no lower than the midpoint of the top part of your index finger before the first knuckle.
 Line up your thumb on the opposite hand (with the rubber band around it) so that it's directly behind your aiming index finger. Your thumb should be pointing straight up with the inside of your thumb facing toward your index finger. To fire the rubber band, release it from your thumb.

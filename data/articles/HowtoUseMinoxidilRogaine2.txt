 Minoxidil is not a permanent cure for baldness, and will only be effective as long as you use it at least twice a day, every day.


Use your phone to set a twice-a-day reminder, until it becomes an automatic habit.
 Additional amounts or more frequent applications will not improve your results; you'll only waste product.
 If you skip an application, don't double up the next day. Simply pick back up where you left off.

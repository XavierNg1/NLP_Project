 Preheat the oven to 350ºF/180ºC.
 Transfer to one bowl.


If pureeing the carrots, cut into diced pieces before adding to the food processor.
 Mix well.
 Combine thoroughly by stirring with the spatula. If needed, you can also try mixing with your very clean fingers.
 Mix in the molasses gradually. The resulting mixture should feel sticky and not be runny. If it is runny, add more flour to soak up the liquid.
 Shape the dough in a mound or cake shape, using your hands.
 Bake for about 20 minutes, or until it is a golden brown color. It should not feel wet, and it will be firm and slightly soft inside.
 Allow to cool on a wire baking rack.
 It's now ready to serve––be sure to sing Happy Birthday to your horse.


The cake must only be served in slices; do not feed the horse the cake in its entirety.

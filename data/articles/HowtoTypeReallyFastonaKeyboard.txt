 If you are going for speed, choosing the standard keyboard layout is out of the question. The standard keyboard layout, called Qwerty, was - to cut a long story short - designed to be inefficient. The Dvorak keyboard was designed to be fast, comfortable and easy to learn, and you should be able to achieve 20 to 25Â % more speed with it, even if you switch after you've learned to type on another layout. You must remember where are the buttons on keyboard. If you are a beginner at typing try to write your name or something you are familiar with your school name or your address etc. To learn more about the layouts, go to .

 There are tons of free alternatives that should fit most people fine. Don't look at the keyboard, and if you have decided to go for the Dvorak layout, don't move the keys around. This will only slow down your learning. To speed up your learning, try to practice with text that makes sense, and not the usual repetitive sequences of characters - these do not really work.
 To motivate yourself, make notes of your results before, during and after your training to see the increase in speed. Choose different tests, so that you don't end up memorizing a text (which gives inaccurate results).

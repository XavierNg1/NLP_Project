 Most domestic partnership laws require that you live in a committed relationship. This often includes living in the same home and acting as a married couple. If an employer requires proof of a domestic partnership or civil union prior to offering benefits, they should also require proof of a marriage., Unlike marriages, ceremonies are not required for domestic partnerships. Many couples like to celebrate their relationship with a formal ceremony, and you can do that. Some differences between marriage and domestic partner ceremonies include:


The officiant (person who conducts the ceremony) does not have to be recognized by the jurisdiction
An officiant is not required
The ceremony can be performed either before or after the domestic partnership is registered.
 If your employer does not offer benefits for domestic partners, you may want to ask them to. There is currently no requirement that benefits be extended to unmarried partners.

 In a brightly lit room, raise your chain to eye level and carefully inspect all of the links, the clasp, and any embellishments. If the clasp is already loose, then you may damage it beyond repair by cleaning it. If any gemstones are damaged, then they may fall off during the cleaning process.You can take your gold chain to a jeweler and ask them to repair the damage and give it a thorough cleaning as well.
 If you are unsure about how your cleaning solution will affect your chain, then take a q-tip, dip it in a bit of solution, and apply it to one link. Observe to see if the link shows any discoloration as a result. If you see any discoloration or problems developing, rinse the chain out under warm water right away.
 It is quite common to lose a piece of jewelry down a drain as a result of the cleaning process. Before you start to clean, block off the sink drain with a cover. Or, place a mesh strainer over the drain to ensure that your chain is safe to handle, even if dropped., If your gold chain includes gemstones, such as diamonds or pearls, you will want to carefully consider how a cleaning solution or process could impact them as well. Some solutions that are fine for gold alone, such as ammonia, could prove overly abrasive to an embellishment, like a freshwater pearl.Also, make sure to keep your scrubbing gentle. Or, you could accidently snag and pull a gemstone out of its setting. Some gemstones can even loose color if scrubbed too hard., When in doubt, go to a jewelry store and talk with a professional jeweler. They can suggest cleaning methods and even offer advice regarding possible cleaning solutions. This is especially important if your gold chain is antique or especially delicate.If you bought your gold chain from a national jewelry chain, you might also be able to contact customer service for cleaning advice.

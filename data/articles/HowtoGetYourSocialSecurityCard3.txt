 You will need to provide all of the original documents required of someone applying for a brand new card, in addition to providing proof of your new identity. For example, in addition to your original birth certificate, you will need to provide a document proving a name change. Accepted documents include a marriage license, divorce decree, Certificate of Naturalization (which displays your new name), or a court order approving a legal name change.This name change document must:


be recent (less than two years old for adults, or less than four years old for minors under 18 years of age)identify you by both your old and new identity, Unlike getting a new card or replacing a lost one, the application type to reflect a name change is considered "corrected." You will need to select this option under the heading "Type of Card" in order to have your request processed correctly., The process of correcting a Social Security card is generally similar to that of requesting a new or replacement card (aside from the additional identification requirements). However, failing to correct your Social Security card information can have damaging effects. You must notify both your current employer(s) and the SSA of any name changes in order to avoid tax delays and prevent your wages from being posted incorrectly. Having your wages posted incorrectly may reduce your future Social Security benefits, or it could result in you owing money back to the SSA.

 For the ice cream, you’ll need 1 cup (200 g) of strawberries. Use a knife to remove the stems and the white pulp inside the berries. Next, chop them into pieces that are approximately ¼- to ½-inch (6- to 13-cm) in size.You can use frozen berries, but you’ll need to thaw them slightly so you can puree them more easily in the next step.
 After you’ve chopped the berries, add ½ cup (100 g) to a blender. Pulse the berries until they have a smooth texture, which should take 10 to 15 seconds.You can use a food processor instead of the blender if you prefer.
 Add a 14-ounce (396 g) can of sweetened condensed milk, 3 tablespoons (43 g) of melted, unsalted butter, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract, the pureed strawberries, and the remaining 1 cup (100 g) of chopped berries to a medium bowl. Stir the mixture together until it is well combined.If you want your strawberry ice cream to have a strong pink color, you can mix in 2 drops of red food coloring. Without the coloring, the ice cream will be primarily white or a very pale pink.
 Add 2 cups (480 ml) of very cold heavy whipping cream to the bowl of a stand mixer. Whip the cream on high speed until it becomes very thick, which should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes.You can pour the cream into a large bowl and use an electric hand mixer if you prefer.
It helps to chill the bowl that you’re whipping the cream in.
 Once the whipped cream is extremely thick, add the strawberry mixture to the it. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the fruit mixture into the cream until they are well blended., When the ice cream mixture is fully blended, transfer it to a freezer-safe container. Cover it with the lid or plastic wrap, and chill it in the freezer for at least 6 hours, or until it is solid enough to scoop.When you’re ready to enjoy the ice cream, let it stand out at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes so you can scoop it more easily.

 You'll need to adjust the strip length according to how large or small you want the tulle rose to be, and the smaller it is, the fiddlier the rose-making will be. A standard size for the strips would be about 90cm/1 yard (0.9Â m) and 7.5-10cm (3-4 inches) wide.


Cut lots of strips if you're making lots of roses.;

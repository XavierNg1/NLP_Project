 On your way home is a great time to discuss the outing that you had. Ask your kids what they enjoyed and what they didn’t enjoy. Use this to recap on how they did or did not meet your expectations on this trip.For example, you might ask your children questions like “What was your favorite part of the movie?” Then you can follow it up with a statement like “I was very proud that you sat quietly like we discussed.”

, Children crave attention from their caregivers. By giving them positive attention when they do the things you have asked, you fulfill that need. Also, let them hear you brag about their good behavior to your co-parent and to others. This helps to build your relationship with the child, and to reinforce the behaviors that you like to see.You could reinforce good behaviors by saying things like “I was so proud that you stayed close enough to reach the cart through the whole trip. Thank you for doing what we talked about.”

, If you need to address your child acting out, be sure to tie that to a consequence that they can understand. It helps if the consequence fits naturally with the acting out, instead of just being an assigned punishment of some kind. This will help your child understand the consequences that come with acting inappropriately in public places.A good example of this would be to say something like “I was disappointed that you weren’t able to walk beside me in the store. It’s too bad that we couldn’t stay long enough to let you choose a cereal. Maybe next time we can do better and have time to get cereal.”

 Install fences, gates, or locks to prevent easy access to an area. If you already have a wood fence that is not working, consider installing a metal fence or a chain link fence that is less attractive to a graffitist.Paint your fence as well. Unpainted fences attract graffitists.Consider a privacy fence or gate to protect your home or small business.;
, Cover a space with vines, plants, or shrubs. Plants add to the beauty of a property and will make it more difficult for someone to reach the surface. Graffitists want an area with easy access.You can also place a sign that says “Beware of poison ivy.” Most people are not able to identify position ivy, and they may avoid the area all together.
Thorny bushes such as roses, barberry, and pyracantha are an extra deterrent. They cover the area and are painful if someone tries to walk through them.,


If you have an exposed fence, you could plant bushes in front of the fence.
 Ask local artists or students to come and paint your walls. If you're a business, ask them to create advertising for you. A covered wall is much less inviting. If you're a homeowner, consider painting on any exposed areas such as walls and fences. Even patterns can serve as a deterrent because they take away the "blank canvas" appearance.Involving local artists and high school students also creates a sense of community and provides a positive outlet.

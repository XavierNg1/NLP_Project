 Boil for three minutes, then cool.
 Add 2 baking soda dissolved in hot water, powdered cloves,cinnamon, pepper and the 10 cups of flour. Knead in the final cup.
 The fridge is fine but so is a cool room.
 Place on greased cookie sheets.
 This will take about 50 minutes.
 Place cookie in mouth and let it dissolve. Delicious! The rest can be stored in airtight containers; they keep well.

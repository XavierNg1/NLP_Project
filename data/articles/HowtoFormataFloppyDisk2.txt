 Make sure that the disk is inserted before you go looking for it on your computer. Ensure that the disk is inserted rightside-up.


Make sure that the disk lock is not engaged before inserting the disk.
When formatting a disk, all the information contained on it will be erased, so make sure you've backed up anything you need to save.
 To quickly format the disk, type format x:. Replace X with the floppy drive letter. Press Y to confirm that you want to format the disk.
 There are several switches that you can add to the end of the format command to modify what happens. For example, to perform a Quick Format on the A: drive, you would type format /q a:.



/fs:filesystem - Replace filesystem with FAT, FAT32, exFAT, NTFS, or UDF depending on your needs.

/v:label - Replace label fi with the label you want to give the disk. Keep it under 16 characters for compatibility.

/q - Performs a quick format.

/c - Files added will be automatically compressed (NTFS only)

/p:# - Overwrites the space on the disk with 0s and then random numbers for each count. Replace # with the number of counts you want to occur. This is best used for sensitive data you want to completely erase (Vista and later only).

Ensure your dog is getting a healthy and balanced food that was formulated by a company with credentials in animal nutrition.

You may have heard about adding digestive enzyme supplements to your dog’s meal to help with digestion. Generally there is no reason to use these supplements unless your dog has a medical condition diagnosed by your vet.
 Give your dog a chew toy or KONG toy stuffed with kibble to keep it occupied while you eat. This will ensure that your dog never even knows that you are eating. And if your dog doesn’t know you’re eating, it cannot engage in unwanted begging., The most important thing you can do to prevent your dog from begging is to consistently refuse to give it food while it begs. Never give your dog food from your meal while you are eating. And if you do wish to share some scraps of an appropriate food with your dog when your meal is done, do not feed them to your dog while seated at the table. Instead, place them in its dish.

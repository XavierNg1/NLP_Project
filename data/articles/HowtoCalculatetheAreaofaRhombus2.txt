 You can also think of this as multiplying the altitude of the rhombus with the length of the side of the rhombus. Let's say the height of the rhombus is 7 cm and the base is 10 cm.
 Once you know the base and height of the rhombus, all you have to do to find the area of the shape is to multiply them. So, 10 cm x 7 cm = 70 cm2. The area of the rhombus is 70 cm2.

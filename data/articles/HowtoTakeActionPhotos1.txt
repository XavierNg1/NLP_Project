 When taking an action shot, the quality of the image is greatly dependent upon your vantage point. As you search for the perfect spot, look for a location that


Offers you an unobstructed view of the action.
Provides your subject with a simple, stationary background (Busy backgrounds lead to blurry images)
Allows you to move with the action.;
, Once you have selected a good vantage point, prepare your camera to take crisp action shots in this environment by adjusting its settings. Essentially, you want to adjust your camera’s settings so that it enters into a “sports” or “action” mode. The number of settings you must adjust to get your camera into this mode is entirely dependent upon the quality of your camera.


For smartphones, you will need to activate your camera’s burst mode and/or turn on its Tracking AF setting.
If you are using a point-and-shoot digital camera, you will need to manually switch your device into sports mode or action mode.
If you have a DSLR camera, you will need to manually adjust your shutter priority mode, shutter speed, and its ISO setting. You will also need to turn it to a high speed shooting mode, place it in continuous focus mode, and select a suitable focus point setting., Prior to snapping the picture, position your subject in the frame. To focus on the subject:


Tap on the screen of your smartphone.
Place your subject in the center of the frame of your point-and shoot camera (this is where the focusing sensor is located).
Press halfway down on the shutter button of your DSLR camera to engage Continuous Auto-Focus, As your subject moves, follow it with your camera. Remain straight, steady, and level while you pan with the moving object. When you press down on the shutter button to capture the shot, continue to follow the action.


If you are using a smartphone or DSLR camera, hold down the shutter button to take multiple images.

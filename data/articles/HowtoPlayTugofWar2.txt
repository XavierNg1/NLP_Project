 You will need to have a good strong rope to play tug of war. The rope should be free of knots, fraying, or any flaws that might allow extra holding or rubbing. You may want to select a nylon rope to reduce rope-burn incidents.Make sure that the rope is long enough to accommodate all of your players as well. All of the players should have room to grip the rope and stand beside it.
 You will need to place a marker in the center of the rope so that players will be able to find the center. Find the center of the rope and mark it with one color flag or marker. Make sure the rope is straight when you measure it to find the center.You may also want to place markers on both sides of the central marker to indicate where players should start holding the rope. Place these markers about three feet away from the center point on both sides of the rope.
 Resin is an optional way to enhance your grip on the rope. Use resin or chalk from a sporting goods store or department store. Take out a palm full of the substance and clap or rub it between your palms. Work the substance around and between your fingers as well.This isnâ€™t common in casual tug of war games, but can help you hold onto the rope for more organized games.
 It can be fun to play tug of war on a slippery, muddy terrain, but this may also make it harder to win based on strength. If you want to play a fair game of tug of war, then choose a level, dry playing ground, such as a dry field or the floor of a gymnasium.

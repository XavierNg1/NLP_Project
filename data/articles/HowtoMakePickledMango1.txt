 Remove the pit from the mango. You can also cube the mango into small chunks if you prefer that. You should lightly salt the pieces of mango and let them absorb the salt for twenty minutes.;
, This will remove some of the moisture from the mango.
 Heat 1 1/2 cup of mustard oil in a pan until it sizzles, which should take between 1 and 2 minutes. If you don't have mustard oil, you can use regular cooking oil and 2 tsp. of mustard seeds instead, taking care to mix them together. Take it off the stove and cool it

, The longer you crush it, the more fine it will become.
 Mix the fenugreek with the fennel seeds, turmeric, chilli powder, curry leaves, vinegar, salt, and half of the mustard oil.
 Mix the spice mixture thoroughly with the mango pieces by hand, so that each mango piece is covered by the mixture very well. You can wear gloves if you don't want to get the mixture all over your hands. You can place the mixture in a bowl and individually dip each of the mango slices into the mixture, making sure you cover both sides of them.
 You can use multiple jars if you don't have a large one handy. Pour the remaining oil over the pieces.
 You can use a rubber band to secure the cloth.
 This will give the mangoes enough time to fully absorb the spicy pickling mixture. You can also shake the jars from time to time to help the pieces absorb the oil.
 Once the mango is fully pickled, you can just use a jar with a regular lid. Make sure it's sealed tightly so the mango can last longer.
 Enjoy this tasty spicy pickled mango with bread, rice, or vegetables.

 In this case the water heater shut off valve is the most common source of this problem.Verify the shut-off valve is completely open. For safety, each water heater includes a shut-off valve to use in case of emergencies.
If the valve is shut even slightly, this can affect your water pressure.
 The water pressure issue should be resolved when hot water is run through a faucet.


If the hot water low pressure problem is not resolved, it could be the water lines into the water heater or the appliance itself.
In this case, call a plumber to troubleshoot further.
 Blockages can occur within the lines, and plumbers have efficient ways of checking them.The appliance itself may also be causing a problem. A licensed plumber will need to evaluate it to see if it needs to be replaced.
Working with water heaters can be dangerous, so it is best to leave this job to a professional.

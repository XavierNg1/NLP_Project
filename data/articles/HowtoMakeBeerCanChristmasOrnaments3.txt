 The great thing about this decoration is that you don’t have to go all crafty in order to worship your favorite brewsky. All you’ll need is a few can tops, some felt fabric and your favorite brew label.
 Consider using the same color fabric as your beer can; for example, if you're doing Pabst Blue Ribbon, go for royal blue felt fabric.


Make the circle at least the same size as the bottom of a beer can, enough to hold the sticker proudly in the center.
 Either way, make sure the logo is fully intact.
 Use super glue for an aluminum label and a glue stick for a beer bottle paper label.


Use the glue sparingly for the beer bottle label, to avoid any potential for bleeding through.
 Encircle the fabric circle with the tabs to create a circular border. Glue in place with super glue.


Place the last tab at the top with the opening pointed upward. This tab will hold the ornament hook in place. Use super glue to hold it in place.
 Tie a firm knot to create the hanger.

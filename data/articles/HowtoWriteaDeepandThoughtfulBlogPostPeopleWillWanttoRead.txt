 Read the news and surf the Internet for new trends and news.;
, Don't feel the need to write about everything new. Wait for you to hear something that you want to write about, something that deeply resonates with you.
 Write down everything you want to say. Consider referring to other posts or articles, so that it is apparent that your post is well written.
 One of the problems with the Internet is that there are millions of people writing blogs. In order to make your blog post grab someone's attention, you need to have an opinion or spin your post in a way that is different from the millions of other posts out there.
 Leave your introduction until the end. Make sure to keep it concise - don't wander from the point. Remember, most people want to come to the point right away. Unless you are a world-renowned comedian, people won't want to read pages of your reading before coming to the point.
 Make it something strong that will make people remember your post.
 While it may sound backwards to write your introduction last, this is often better. While you were writing, you may have decided to change your direction slightly. The introduction should be an accurate, enticing summary of the article to pull your readers in. Don't give such a thorough summary that your readers won't feel the need to finish your article though!

, Make sure it flows well, is engaging and has a point.
 Make it something memorable and unique, so that people can find it easily when they search for it. Remember to include popular keywords in your title so that people will find it easily.
, Use Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and other social networking sites to share your article with other people.

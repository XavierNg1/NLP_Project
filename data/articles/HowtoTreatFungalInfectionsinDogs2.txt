 With infections such as aspergillosis or nasal aspergillosis, common fungal infections of the respiratory system, the dog will experience coughing, a hard time breathing, nasal discharge, pain in the nose, sneezing, and sometimes a bleeding nose. If your dog has these symptoms, it may have a fungal infection in its respiratory system.Many of these symptoms can indicate other infections as well. A veterinarian can help you figure out what specific illness your dog has, as well as how it can best be treated.
 If your dog's symptoms persist, and it is uncomfortable or in pain, contact your veterinarian. Discuss whether your dog needs to be seen by the veterinarian or if the condition is not that serious and you can wait to see if your dog's immune system eliminates the infection.In general, if your dog just has clear nasal discharge or a light cough, then the infection is usually not that bad. However, if your dog's nasal discharge is thick and yellow or green, the dog is bleeding from its nose, coughing deeply, or coughing up blood, then the infection could be more serious.
 Aspergillosis and nasal aspergillosis can both be treated with an anti-fungal drug. This will be given to the dog either in the mouth or in the nose. Follow your veterinarian's instructions for how and how long to give your dog the medication.As with many medications, be sure to give your dog the medication for as long as the veterinarian tells you to, even if the symptoms have gone away. This will help to assure that the infection is totally eliminated, not just that is has been suppressed but is still in the nasal cavity.

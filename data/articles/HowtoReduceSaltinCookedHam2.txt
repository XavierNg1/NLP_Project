 Add a teaspoon of distilled vinegar to your over-salted cooked ham before storing it. The acidity of the vinegar will counteract the saltiness and even out the flavour. Pour the vinegar over the ham slowly to cover it evenly.Avoid adding too much vinegar to the ham, which will create a sour flavor.
 Cut a small lemon in half and squeeze both parts over the ham. Disburse the lemon juice evenly so that the ham is evenly covered. The tanginess of the lemon will offset the extra saltiness.Do this before serving the ham, or before storing it.
 Adding a creamy sauce (e.g., hollandaise sauce) to your ham will help to mask its saltiness. The creamy component will make the dish taste milder and balance out the flavour. Pour the sauce over sliced pieces of ham before serving it., Pour honey on your ham to reduce its saltiness. Salty and sugary flavors balance each other out, and honey complements ham perfectly. Add enough honey to coat the ham entirely (approximately 1 cup for a 5 lb/0.5 kg ham).You can also drizzle honey on sliced pieces of ham before serving it.
 Adding an extra source of fat (e.g., oil or butter) to your ham will add an extra layer of flavour to "absorb" the saltiness of the meat. Baste your ham with a basting brush dipped in olive oil or melted butter, coating the entire ham. Be sure to use unsalted butter to avoid adding to the saltiness.For best results, baste the ham halfway through heating it.

Teen drinkers are more likely to get fat or have health problems, too. One study by the University of Washington found that people who regularly had five or more drinks in a row starting at age 13 were much more likely to be overweight or have high blood pressure by age 24 than their non-drinking peers. People who continue binge drinking well into adulthood risk damaging their organs, such as the liver, heart, and brain.

People who drink daily also often have difficulty in school. Drinking can damage a student's ability to study well and get decent grades, as well as affect sports performance (the coordination thing).

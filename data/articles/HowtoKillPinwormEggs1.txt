 One of the easiest ways to diagnose a pinworm infection is to use the tape test. Take a piece of clear cellophane tape and wrap it around your fingers with the sticky side out. As soon as your child wakes up, firmly press the sticky tape on the skin around the anus. The eggs will stick to the tape.Keep the tape and put it immediately into a sealed baggie. Remember, the tape is infectious and can spread eggs to other people.
Make sure you perform the tape test before your child uses the toilet or bathes. Some physicians recommend the tape test three mornings in a row, but chances are good that one test will be enough.;
, Even if you see eggs on the tape, take your child or the infected person to the doctor. A doctor can verify that the infection is pinworms and not something else. Bring the tape with you to show your childâ€™s doctor.The doctor can place the tape under a microscope to determine if there are pinworm eggs on the tape.
 Pinworm infections can be treated with two doses of medicine. The first batch of medicine is given when the pinworms are discovered. The second one is repeated two weeks later. This is to make sure all the adults that have hatched since the first dose are killed, because the medicine is ineffective in killing pinworm eggs.Everyone in the household should be treated at the same time.
Common medications used are mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate, and albendazole. Pyrantel pamoate is available as an over-the-counter medication. The others are available as prescriptions. Discuss with your doctor which medicine he suggests that is right for your infection.

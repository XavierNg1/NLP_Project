 Silver coins derive their value both from the silver content in and the numismatic value of the coin. In most cases, the numismatic value of the coin is the main determinant of the value. What this means is that the characteristics of the coin — its provenance, quality, etc. — means more to collectors than the actual value of the silver when talking price. For this reason, many investors caution against investing in silver coins if you're not interested in numismatics at all.


Because of the collectible nature of silver coins, their prices can be very volatile. In fact, their prices can shift dramatically due to market demands, often for reasons that have nothing to do the price of silver. If you're going to invest in silver coins, be aware of this before embarking on your journey.
 Silver bars are bars of almost pure silver, much like you'd see in the movies. Because of their unique nature, they often trade at above-market price for silver. You can find silver bars at major banks or bullion dealers.


Silver bullion is effectively the same thing as silver bars. Bullion coins are made of precious metals, designed to store value instead of being used in commerce. As such, you can buy silver bullion coins if you're not wedded to the notion of having silver bars.
Silver bars come in different shapes and weights. 1 oz., 5 oz., 10 oz., 100 oz., and 1000 oz. bars are the standard, although there are certain manufacturers who design even lighter bars. What you need to know when thinking about weight is this: The smaller the bar, the higher the premium you'll pay.If you really want to pinch your pennies, buy bars in bulk!

, Silver rounds are a cross between a bar and a coin. Like bars and bullion, they have no numismatic value. Like coins, they maintain the same circular shape and usually contain a troy ounce of silver (1/12 of a pound). When purchased from a private manufacturer, they can be minted with a custom design.

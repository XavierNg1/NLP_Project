, If your grill is older, make sure that you remove any residue and crusty bits. Start with a metal scraper and finish with a wire brush.
 Cover the grill rack with foil.
 To catch any drippings from the oil or shortening, put a foil-covered cookie sheet under the rack. Let it bake for at least 30 minutes to give the oil time to season the cast iron.
 Repeat this process at least 2 more times until you have a dark finish. Each repetition deepens the seasoning, protects the metal and helps develop that virtually non-stick surface.
 You are now ready for some sweet grilling sensations!

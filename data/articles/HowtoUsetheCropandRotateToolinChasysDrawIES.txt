, You have three options: Fixed Size, Fixed Aspect, and Allow All. If you want your images to be a certain size, choose the first one. If the size doesn't matter, but you want the correct aspect, choose the second.
 This screenshot is using the second option, Fixed Aspect. The handle in the middle is the center of your image. The handle on the right, in this instance, helps to correct the horizon and the handle on the bottom will change the size, keeping it all in aspect.

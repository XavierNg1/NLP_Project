 Pack snow into a tall mound around a plastic drinking cup so that there’s a large hole in the center. Fill the volcano with baking soda, add some red food coloring, then pour in vinegar and watch it erupt!Make your snow volcano part of an illustrative diorama with dinosaur figurines and some sticks and rocks from outside.Build your volcano inside of a larger container so that you won’t make a mess when it reacts.
 Mix cold water and watercolor paint or food coloring in a spray bottle. Spritz it onto the surface of the snow to make it change colors before your very eyes.Think of the snow as a blank canvas for you to create a beautiful, vibrant masterpiece.
You can also paint directly onto the snow using a paintbrush and water-based paint., Snow can make for a fascinating science experiment. Put a few ounces of snow in a dish and keep it under observation as it melts into water. Afterwards, place the water in a pan on the stove top to witness its transformation through all three states of matter.Have a parent or older sibling help you operate the stove safely.
Turn a snow day into an impromptu chemistry lesson for kids first learning about solids, liquids and gasses.

 This treatment will vary, depending on what is causing the infection. He or she may prescribe oral or topical antibiotics, however, many times a doctor will simply suggest soaking the toe in a solution of ½ warm water and ½ liquid antibacterial soap for about 15 minutes three to four times every day and keeping the area clean.Soaking helps with the infection and softens the skin to allow the infection to “come to a head."
In the case of toenail fungal infections, your doctor may prescribe an oral anti-fungal medication or an anti-fungal prescription nail polish., If the infection is deep and serious, a physician may suggest treating it with a small surgical procedure.This means a quick surgical drainage of an infection, usually used in the case of an abscess.


The physician may first numb the toe with lidocaine and then open the infection with a scalpel and allow the pus to drain. Then, depending on how deep the infection is, a wicking material may be placed in the wound to allow for more drainage.
The wound is then packed with gauze for 24 to 48 hours. The packing can be removed after this time and the wound is then examined and re-bandaged.Oral antibiotics may be given as well.
 Surface (superficial) infections of the toe can be treated in a number of ways. These include:


Soaking: Just as with a more serious infection, soaking toe in a solution of ½ warm water and ½ a liquid antibacterial soap is usually recommended. You should soak for about 15 minutes once a day.
OTC (over-the-counter) antibiotic creams and ointments for bacterial infections: These include Polysporin, Neosporin, Bacitracin or a Triple Antibiotic ointment.
OTC (over-the-counter) anti-fungal creams for fungal infections: These include Lotrimin, Derman, Canestan, or another anti-fungal medicine.

 Two to four ice cubes should be enough to keep the spritzer cold.
 Use orange juice if you want to create a "screwdriver" spritzer, since a screwdriver is a cocktail commonly made with orange juice and vodka. You can experiment with other juices, as well.
 Club soda will give your spritzer extra bite, but seltzer water works just as well.
 A standard shot glass is 1.5 ounces (44.4 milliliters), so you should add approximately 3 ounces (88.8 milliliters) to your juice spritzer.
 Use a slow circular motion, only stirring the drink a few times to combine it. Stirring too fast or too much will destroy too much of the carbonation.
 Pour the juice spritzer and the ice into each glass slowly. Carefully allow the ice cubes to slip into the glass, but do not dump them into the glass since they may create an unnecessary splash upon doing so.
 The longer you wait to drink to spritzer, the more carbonation it will lose.

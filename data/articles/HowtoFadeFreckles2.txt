 A somewhat expensive treatment, laser freckle removal is a satisfactory way to remove or fade freckles from your face. The laser essentially removes the melanin pigment in your skin that causes freckles. Following the treatment you may experience crusting or bruising on your skin, but after a week or two your skin should recover.Although not completely permanent, laser treatments do a better job of fading or removing your freckles than other treatments or creams, but before you have laser removal it could be beneficial to talk to a dermatologist or doctor.
 Chemical peels also do a decent job of removing or fading freckles. Usually these treatments are not a one-time treatment but occur over a period of time. The chemical peels use intensive exfoliation techniques to remove the top layer of skin. After the treatment has been applied and the top layer of skin peeled off, a new layer of skin will grow that has little to no sun damage.These peels can be very harsh on your skin, and it may prevent you from going out in public for a time as your skin heels. Also, after your new skin has grown back, your freckles can easily come back with a small amount of sun exposure.
 This treatment is relatively new, but has proven to help remove or fade freckles from your face. Light pulses penetrate the skin, creating heat in your skin tissue. You body then removes the tissue through natural processes, and this results in a more even skin tone and appearance.These treatments usually last one to two sessions, and you may experience some redness a few hours after your treatment. The beneficial thing about these treatments is they only last 15 to 30 minutes.

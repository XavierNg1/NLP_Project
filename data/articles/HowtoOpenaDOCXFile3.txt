 Google Drive will convert documents to the Google format, which will allow you to open it. You can then download it as a different format, or edit it directly in Drive. Google Drive requires a free Google account.
 Click the red Upload button, located next to the Crete button in the upper-left corner of the page. It looks like an upwards-pointing arrow over a horizontal line.


A file browser will open, allowing you to search for the file on your computer.
 When the file is chosen, a window will appear asking you to set your upload settings. Make sure the "Convert documents..." box is checked. This will convert the .DOCX file into the Google Docs format, allowing you to edit it in Drive.


If you don't convert the file, you can still view it in Drive but you won't be able to edit it.
 Your file will be added to your My Drive folder, which can be accessed from the left navigation menu on the Drive page. Click the file to open it in the Drive viewer or editor, depending on whether or not you converted it.
 There's a good chance that any fancy formatting was messed up during the conversion process, so review the document to ensure that everything is where it should be.
 You can download the file back to your computer as another file format, such as .PDF or .RTF. Click File → Download As → and select the format you want. The file will be downloaded to your computer like any other file you would download.Any advanced formatting such as right-to-left text and other heavy scripting will most likely not convert properly.

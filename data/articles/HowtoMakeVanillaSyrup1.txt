Almost any medium-sized pot will do. You may want to avoid cast iron â€” it can be tricky to clean syrup off of.;
, Set a burner to medium-high heat and stay near the stove. Stir every minute or so. As soon as the water reaches a gentle but steady boil, reduce the heat slightly to maintain this simmer.
 This usually takes about three minutes or so, but it's a matter of personal preference.Feel free to let the mixture boil for longer if you want a thicker syrup. Stir often.


As the mixture boils, the water will evaporate and enter the air as vapor. However, the sugar will remain, which causes the mixture to get thicker.
 When the syrup has reached your desired thickness, remove it from the heat. Carefully pour the vanilla extract in. Stir to combine.
 When the syrup is at a pleasantly warm temperature, it's ready to consume or add to your dish. Enjoy! See the "Serving Suggestions" section below if you're looking for ideas of how to use your syrup.


Be very careful about spilling or touching the syrup while it's still hot. Its stickiness can make it very hard to get off, which can lead to bad burns.
If you don't want to use the syrup immediately, you can also transfer it to an airtight container and store it in the fridge. Since it's mostly sugar and water, it won't go bad for a very long time.

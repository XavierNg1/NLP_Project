 Bubble tea was traditionally made with black tea, but you can use green, chai, yerba mate, or any kind of tea. You can even use coffee!

, You can substitute the cream with soy milk, milk, half and half, sweetened condensed milk, or non dairy creamer.
 (The bubbles formed by shaking are what the tea was named after, although most people assume it's because the tapioca pearls look like bubbles!)

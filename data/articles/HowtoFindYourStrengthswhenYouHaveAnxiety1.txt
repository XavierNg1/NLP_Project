Remind yourself that you do have strengths and good qualities, even if you’re not perfect. Instead of focusing on your normal, human mistakes, think about the times you’ve succeeded at something.The way you talk to yourself has a big impact on your self-image. Talk to yourself in a kind, encouraging way, and don’t say anything to yourself that you wouldn’t say to a friend.
For instance, instead of saying to yourself, “I’m terrible at this,” tell yourself, “I’ve never done this before, but I’ll get better with more practice.”;
, When you’re too worried about how you stack up to other people, it’s easy to lose sight of your own unique strengths. Focus on yourself, and don’t try to compete with people whose personalities and life experience may be completely different from yours.For example, if you compare yourself to a friend who doesn't have anxiety, you are being unreasonable. They don't have the same experiences as you, so it's an unfair assessment.
 Living with anxiety isn’t fun, but there are a few positives to the situation. Anxious people often have good personal qualities like self-control, bravery, kindness, and cautiousness. Think about whether your anxiety may have instilled some positive character traits in you.For instance, if you often have anxiety in social situations, you might be very forgiving of others who aren't social butterflies.
 Give yourself room to grow by getting out of your comfort zone. Put yourself in unfamiliar situations, learn new things, and give yourself permission to fail. Expanding your horizons will give your self-esteem a boost, and you might discover some of your strengths at the same time.For example, you could travel somewhere new or pick up a part-time volunteer job.
Pushing yourself outside your comfort zone might be difficult at first, but as you practice doing it more, it will get easier.

 Hot buttered rum can be made a few different ways, but is arguably best when cider is used. For a batch that will yield eight servings, gather a half gallon unfiltered apple cider, 1 stick unsalted butter, ¼ cup dark brown sugar, 1½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, ¼ teaspoon ground cloves, ⅛ teaspoon salt.Add the butter, brown sugar, and spices to the cider as it simmers in a pot with the burner set to low. Stir until the butter and the sugar are entirely dissolved.
Use a ladle to serve the hot buttered cider into individual mugs, adding rum as desired. The amount and type of rum you use is up to you. The darker the rum, the more likely it will add sweetness to the drink.
 Substituting rum for bourbon essentially provides a twist on an old classic. For a strong, two-serving batch, use 1 cup cider, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon honey, ¼ teaspoon each of cloves, cinnamon, and ginger, and 4 ounces of bourbon. Mix the butter and spices until fully combined. Simmer the cider in a saucepan over low heat, and whisk in the butter mixture until it is fully melted.
Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the bourbon. Split the beverage into two portions and serve while still they are still steaming.
 For a punch bowl’s worth of servings, try a recipe that uses 3 cups apple brandy, 7 tablespoons brown sugar, ¾ stick butter, 12 cups unfiltered apple cider, and ¾ cup fresh lemon juice. Bring the brandy, brown sugar, and butter to simmer over medium heat, stirring until fully blended. Add the cider, lemon juice, and 12 cinnamon sticks and bring to a brief boil.Serve in a large bowl with a ladle. Make sure everyone knows that there’s alcohol in the beverage, and encourage everyone to make sure they get a cinnamon stick.

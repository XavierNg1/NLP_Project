 It could be pink like the one seen in Mean Girls, but if you're not into that color you could also buy one in pastel shades. This will be your Burn Book.;
, Make it beautiful and attractive. If you want the original Burn Book look (from Mean Girls) cut out funky magazine letters and glue them into your title. Make lipstick kiss marks on the front - you could either buy stickers of lip marks or if you don't mind you could always put on red lipstick and actually kiss the book to make a mark. Finally, doodle random words in the corners like 'backstabber' and write quotes like 'only the strong survive'.
 If someone really gets on your last nerve, add them to the book. To do this, get a photo of them and get a marker pen. Glue them in and let out your feelings.
 If anyone finds it - like snooping parents, siblings, etc - you're going to be in big trouble. Don't use easy hiding places like under the bed. You need to be secretive and creative. You could always take the dust cover off (the paper cover set over the cloth one underneath) of a hardback book, wrap it on the Burn Book and put it on your bookshelf or in a cupboard.
 Say that you found it and were going to hand it in to the school or something plausible like that. A good way to make this even more believable is putting an entry for yourself in the book. Just don't make the handwriting recognizable and remember you did it yourself.

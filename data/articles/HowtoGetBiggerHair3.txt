 In many cases, the easiest way to boost the volume of your hair is to change which side you part it on. Switching the direction that you comb the hair helps lift it away from the scalp so it appears to have more body and fullness.For example, if you normally part your hair in the middle, a deep side part will give it instant volume. You can also move a side part to the center, or switch a left or right part to the other side.
 Dry shampoo can help absorb excess oils from your scalp when you don’t have time to wash your hair so your hair isn’t weighed down. It also adds texture that gives your hair more volume.For the best results, don’t just apply the dry shampoo to your roots. Work it throughout all of your hair for major volume.
 Backcombing your hair may be an old-fashioned hair styling trick, but it definitely works to add volume. Take a section of hair and use a brush tease it backward toward the scalp at the roots. When you’re finished teasing the top layer of your hair, use a brush to smooth it into place with disrupting the volume.Using a fine-tooth comb to tease your hair can create knots. Instead, work with a large paddle brush to add soft volume.
 Adding curls to your hair can definitely make it appear bigger and more voluminous. Use hot rollers or a curling iron to curl your hair, paying particular attention to the top layer to give the impression of fuller hair.If you’re using a curling iron, raise your hair so each section of hair is elevated as you curl it. That will give your hair added lift instead of allowing the curls to drag your locks down.

 If you have a lunch period together, you should sit with your boyfriend. Try to bring both of your friend groups together so that it is a social meal. This will let your boyfriend see you every day, even if you are in the middle of your studies.
 It is best not to have a date on a school night. You can plan your dates for Friday night, any time Saturday, or during the day on Sunday. Make sure that these are fun outings where you can do something active and engaging together, such as ice skating or going to the beach. This will liven up your relationship.Try to avoid talking about school or your studies during your date.
 If you cannot see your boyfriend much during the week, you can still talk to him. While you should not distract yourself while studying, do send him texts throughout the day. A good morning and a good night text are good for letting your boyfriend know that you are thinking about him. After school, ask him how his day went.
 School is a place for studying. You should try to avoid any romantic conflict while you’re at school. If you’re annoyed at your boyfriend, ask him if you can talk privately after school, but try not to have a fight in the hallway or cafeteria. This will publicize your argument, and you may not be able to settle the matter maturely while in a public setting.You can also follow the 48 hour rule. If your boyfriend angers you, wait two days. If you’re still angry, you can bring it up with him. Otherwise, it might be a minor issue, and you can drop it.

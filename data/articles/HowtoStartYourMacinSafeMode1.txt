 You will need to boot from a powered down Mac in order to enter Safe Mode/Safe Boot.;
,, If you are hearing impaired, look for when the screen turns gray.
 You can release the key once you see the logo.
 This may take a little longer than normal, as your Mac is checking the directory structure integrity.
 You will still need to log in with your username and password. You will see the words "Safe Mode" displayed in the upper-right corner of the login screen.


Safe Mode will force the log in screen. If you have "Automatic Log In" turned on you will still be required to enter your password while booting into Safe Mode.
If you can't remember your password, click here.
 When you're done with Safe Mode, reboot your Mac as you normally would and your computer will boot as normal.

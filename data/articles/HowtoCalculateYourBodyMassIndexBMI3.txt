 0.025 is the metric conversion factor necessary to turn inches into meters. For example, if your height is 60 inches, then you would multiple 60 by 0.025 for an answer of 1.5 meters., Next, you need to multiply the last number you got by itself. For example, if the last number you got was 1.5, then multiply 1.5 by 1.5. In this situation, your answer would be 2.25., 0.45 is the metric conversion factor needed to convert pounds into kilograms. This will convert your weight into its metric equivalent. For example, if your weight is 150 pounds, then your answer would be 67.5., Take the number you got for your weight and divide it by the number you got for your squared height. For example, 67.5 would need to be divided by 2.25. The answer is your BMI, which in this example would be 30.

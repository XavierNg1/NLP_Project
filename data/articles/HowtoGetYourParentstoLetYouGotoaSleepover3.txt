 A good mood can change a “no” to a “yes.” You can encourage good moods by doing chores before your parents ask, talking about fun times you’ve shared, or listening together to their favorite music.It can be extra effective to talk about social events, like a school party, family gathering, or festival, where your parents had fun. This can help put them in a good mood., If you find that your parents are usually in a good mood in the morning, try to ask them after breakfast. Their after-breakfast mood will be more agreeable.If your parents are more active during the evening, aim for after dinner., A few days before asking your parents about going to the sleepover, ask them for something else you want but know they won't let you have. Say, ask them if you can adopt a dog from the animal shelter or have your own car. A few days later, when you're ready to ask your parents for the sleepover, they will be more likely to make this small concession after refusing your other, bigger request., By putting what your parents have told you in your own words and repeating it back to them, you will show your parents that you understand what they're saying and how they feel. This will help your chances of having a sleepover and changing your parents' minds. Your parents will see you're mature enough to try to listen to and understand their point of view.

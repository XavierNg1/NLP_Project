 Every girly girl should have a vanity in their room, because you need a special place to get ready for school and fancy places. A desk is also very important to have because you need a place to put your very cute supplies.
 Keep a pile of things you like. The things you don't like, throw them out. Then, put the things you like in a place where you can easily access them. Also, have drawers, storage space, and more. Make your bed neat, but don't stack them to the ceiling with cute stuffed animals and pillows. Keep it simple.


Make a room chart. When making a room chart, you will be able to be more organized because you will plan where everything will need to be. Start by throwing old, dull clothes out, rag dolls, things that make you feel to childish or boyish. You need to remember that you are growing up into a more mature stage in life. Doesn't mean that you have to be a grown up type of girly, you can still have cute fuzzy pink things and stuffed animals and stickers all over!
Organize your makeup equipment. When you organize your makeup, make sure everything has its own place to be. Plus, don't just let people start touching your stuff like they own you and your room. Take control! There should be a lip, eye, cheek, nail, hair, and jewelry section. Accessories need their own section.

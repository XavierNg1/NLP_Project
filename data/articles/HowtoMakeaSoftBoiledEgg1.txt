 To prevent eggs from cracking and to make them easier to peel, gently prick the end of each egg. You can carefully use a small pin or tack to poke a very small indentation through the shell at the large end of the egg. Take care not to poke very far or the white will leak out of the egg.You could also use something with a slightly rounded point to poke the egg. For example, you could use a wooden pestle. If you use this, just tap the larger end of the egg.;
, Put your eggs into a small saucepan and pour enough cold water to cover the eggs by 1-inch (2.5 cm).If you want to cook more than 4 eggs, consider using a larger pot or cooking them in batches. This will ensure that you can remove the eggs quickly, so they won't overcook.
 Turn the heat on to medium-high and keep the lid off of the pan. Once the water begins to boil (bubble vigorously), turn off the heat and start your timer right away.If you continue to boil the eggs over such a high-heat, they may bounce around in the pan and crack as they bump into each other. That's why it's important to turn off the heat (or simmer them gently if you're using a hot start method of cooking).
 You'll need to keep a close eye on the timer, since every minute makes a difference when boiling eggs. Leave the eggs in the hot water to get the desired consistency. Try cooking the eggs for:2 minutes to get a raw yolk and very soft egg white
4 minutes to get a really runny, thick yolk and set white
6 minutes to get a mostly set yolk and set white
8 minutes to get a tender, but set yolk and fully set white

Stack them by color and/or design.
Determine how many of them you want to use. The size and design of your finished quilt will depend on the amount of material you have available.
14x14 inch (35.5cm) squares are a common and comfortable size to use, but you can enlarge that to 18x18 inch (45cm) if the shirts are XXL and shrink that to 10x10 (25cm) or less if you will be using children's shirts.
Common blanket sizes are:

Crib - 42" x 72" (3x4 or 3x5 shirt grid = 12 to 15 shirts)
Twin - 66" x 96" (5x8 or 6x9 grid = 40 to 54 shirts)
Double/full - 81" x 96" (6x8 or 7x9 grid = 48 to 63 shirts)
Queen - 90" x 102" (8x9 or 9x10 grid = 72 to 90 shirts)
Standard King - 108" x 102" (10x10 or 10x11 grid = 100 to 110 shirts)
California King - 102" x 110" (10x11 or 11x11 grid = 110 to 121 shirts)
Note: you can use "sashing" or strips of cloth between the T-shirt panels to reduce the number of shirts needed... these numbers are approximate, and are for a quilt top made of nothing but tees, with no sashing.

, Is there a common color scheme? A theme that runs through them? Any patterns or messages that you would like to emphasize?, A simple grid pattern is the easiest, but you can get as creative as you like. For example:

45 degree block turn


 


22.5 degree turn






Window block






, Do not use fabric softeners or anti-static sheets., You may want to iron the shirts (note that many designs on t-shirts have transfers that may melt, so test a small area prior to ironing) to get out any wrinkles still left after washing and drying.
, A square Plexiglas template can make rotary cutting of these panels a breeze.

Note: Remember to allow a half inch (1.25 cm) of seam allowance all around.
 This prevents the T-shirts from stretching or sagging during construction.


Once you've stabilized the knit tee shirt fabric, you are ready to sew as you would with "normal" fabrics.
 Sewing the panels in columns or rows and then joining those together for the complete panel is the most common method of constructing a quilt top. Here are some alternate block patterns that could work well:

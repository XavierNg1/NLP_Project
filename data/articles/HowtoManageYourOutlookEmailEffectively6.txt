 The users can use the Flag for Follow Up feature in order to flag the email messages and tasks to help sort them or mark them. The flags will prompt you to track an issue, point out someone's request or order for a prompted message and contact. They can also arrange your email folder easily because you know exactly what to do and when to do it. Note that when you create a task and set an expired date for the task, it will automatically be flagged so you do not forget the expired date for the action and fulfill it.

 Add the fresh rosemary to the water and boil the mixture for 30 minutes.You can pull off the rosemary leaves from the branch or just leave them on.

 After the mixture cools, pour it over your cat’s body, so your pet is soaked with the rosemary water.Avoid the eyes and nose because the rosemary water might sting these sensitive areas.

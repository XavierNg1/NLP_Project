 You may want to paint this, but do after separating it from the wood so that everything gets a full coat of paint.
 Use an electric sander or sandpaper and rub off as much of the shiny outer coating of the wood as possible.
 Avoid using a damp cloth so that you don’t have to wait for the wood to dry before painting.
 Special wood primers are available, but a regular spray-on primer is all that is necessary.
 Use your spray paint to form an even coat, spraying at at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) from the surface. Apply multiple coats if desired, allowing dry time in between.

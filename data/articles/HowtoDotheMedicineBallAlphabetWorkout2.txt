 To use the medicine ball alphabet workout as a core exercise, you want a large ball that you can easily hold with two hands. The weight of the ball depends on your personal level of fitness, but generally should be between 5 and 15 pounds.Make sure the ball you choose is one that you can hold out in front of you with arms extended, and move it around without struggling. If you find your back hunching or your shoulders crunching inward, try a lighter ball.
 Do this exercise standing with your feet about shoulder-width apart, or maybe a little wider. Firm up your quads and bend your knees slightly so they don't lock up â€“ you want to keep a little bounce in your knees.Hold the medicine ball between both hands with your arms extended in front of you. The ball should be at about chest height.
 Engage your core, and start tracing each letter of the alphabet in cursive with the medicine ball. Typically you can keep the shapes better if you let your dominant side "lead," but try to move your arms at the same time.Use your abdominal muscles to keep your torso as still as possible while your arms are moving around. Make sure you're not hunching over, and keep your back and shoulders neutral.
 To turn your medicine ball alphabet workout into a mobility challenge, increase your range of motion so that you're making larger letters in front of you with the medicine ball.Move your whole body to make the letters as large as you can. Imagine that you are also using your torso to write the letters as well.
You may want to start with a lighter medicine ball than you were using for the previous exercise, as the increased range of motion can be more challenging.

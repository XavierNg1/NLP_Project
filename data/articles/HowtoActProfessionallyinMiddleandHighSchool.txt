 Never wear sloppy clothing. Always be proper with your selection of school clothes. If your school has a uniform, wear it on all required days. In general, be sophisticated and refined with your clothes.;
, Around this time, you're usually a teenager, or a tween, which is almost the same thing. Teens are between child and adult. Start stepping up in your life whether it be at home or at school.



Responsible: Bring your supplies to class. Always carry filler paper, pencils, pen, extra lead of your type & erasers. Stay organized. Study for tests. Don't blame your teachers, if you truly know it was YOUR mistake.






Respectful: Don't curse in classes or around any one older than you. Try not to curse at all. Use reasonable language. If you're in an argument or a debate, keep a calm, firm tone.






Reliable: If you tell your teacher something, be true with it. Pull through with it. Same if you tell your classmates things. If you're honest, your teacher will be more likely to rely on you and respect you.
 If someone needs you, be there, especially if you have promised. If you're running late, and someone needs you, weigh the differences there and then. Which one would you consider more important? If they were close to suicide and you had to go to class, think. You could save a life or learn a lesson. Let your teacher know where you'll be and why. Be honest!

, In class, make sure you get your work done. At home, get your work done (even those chores).

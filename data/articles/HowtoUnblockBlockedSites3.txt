 You can open all the blocked sites simply by downloading and installing the proxy software. Most VPN software requires payment, but some of them can be used free with ads.


If you don't have administrative privileges on your computer, as is common for employees at work or students at school, you will not be able to use this method.
This method is ideal for accessing blocked websites on your phone. All you have to do is visit your app store. Many of the same software brands available for computers also have a version for phones.
 Click on the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions on screen. Once the software is loaded you can open your browser and surf the web.
 Using a VPN is more secure than using a web-based proxy server. Once you add a VPN, you wonâ€™t need to go to through hoops to visit sites anymore. Just open your browser and surf the web.

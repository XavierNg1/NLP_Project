 Taking five minutes to warm up your muscles can help to prevent injury and it is also a good way to prevent piriformis syndrome. Make sure that you allow your body some time to warm up before you do anything too strenuous.To warm up, just do a lighter version of the type of exercise you are about to perform. For example, if you are about to go for a run, spend five minutes walking briskly.
 Uneven surfaces can cause you to strain your muscles more than flat surfaces do. To avoid this potential risk factor, choose flat surfaces to exercise on. For example, if you live in a hilly area, go to a track to walk or run., Muscles tighten up when we exercise, so it is necessary to stretch after a workout to loosen them up again. After you finish exercising, take a few minutes to stretch all of your major muscle groups. Stretch your neck, arms, legs, and back., Poor posture may also lead to the development of piriformis syndrome, especially during exercise. Take extra care to stand up straight and tall when you are walking or running. Pay attention to your posture all other times as well., Overdoing it may lead to the development of piriformis syndrome, so it is important to know your limits. If you begin to feel pain and/or discomfort during your workout, then stop and take a break. If the pain continues after you resume, then do not do any more exercise. Rest and wait for the pain to subside. If it does not subside, then call your doctor.

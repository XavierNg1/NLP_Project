 Even if you or your child exhibit symptoms of ADHD, you should get an official diagnosis from your doctor before attempting self-treatment. Effective ADHD treatment usually involves a combination of behavioral therapy and medication; ideally, natural remedies should supplement this treatment instead of replacing it.


Your doctor will verify the diagnosis and help you determine which natural treatments are right for you and your specific health needs.
Checking with your doctor is especially important when treating ADHD in children and teenagers since many supplements may not be safe for adolescents.
 While many herbal remedies and other natural supplements are safe for most adults (and for many adolescents, in some cases), the safest natural treatment course will rely on lifestyle changes and mild to moderate dietary improvements since herbal supplements come with a greater risk of negative side effects or interactions.


Try making lifestyle and diet changes before considering supplements. If you do not notice any improvement after several weeks, consider herbal remedies.
Work on getting organized, improving your sleep habits, and limiting screen time. Increasing the amount of exercise you get and improving your diet should also help, but you may wish to consult your doctor before making any dramatic changes.
Social support also has tremendous value. While a mental health therapist can offer professional help, formal support groups and personal support networks can also improve your symptoms.
 If you’re currently on any medications or may begin medicated treatment in the near future, talk to your doctor or do some thorough research to determine if a particular herbal remedy or supplement may have a negative interaction with that medication. If you are not on medication or if a certain herbal remedy should not interact with your medication, that remedy could be worth considering.


Some medications that may negatively interact with herbal supplements include stimulants, blood thinning drugs, anti-seizure drugs, insomnia medications, antidepressants, blood pressure medications, diabetes medications, statins, birth control pills, antifungal drugs, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, antihistamines, anesthesia, medications broken down by the liver, thyroid medications, HIV medications, aspirin, calcium channel blockers, immuno-suppressants, and diuretics., If you are otherwise healthy beyond your ADHD, most natural supplements are probably safe. On the other hand, if you have another medical condition or other health concern, like pregnancy, you should make sure that a specific supplement won’t worsen your condition before taking it.


If you are currently pregnant, may become pregnant, or are currently breastfeeding, talk to your doctor before taking any herbal or natural supplement.

 Keep them in a drawer, sack or small container throughout the year, so that you will have enough to mark your plants when spring arrives.


If you do not drink wine, then you can buy wine corks at a home brew/fermentation supply store.;
, Gather enough wine corks for all of your herb plants. Keep a few extra corks on hand, in case you make a mistake.
 Other colors of marker will not show up as boldly on a cork. Ask someone with good or elaborate handwriting to write on your corks, if you do not like your own handwriting.


You may want to write the name of the herb on both sides of the cork to make it easy to see from both sides.
 Place the cork on top of a surface instead of holding it in your hand while you drill. Drill approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) deep into the center of the bottom of the cork.


Make sure you drill from the bottom of the word toward the top. This will allow the writing to be read from left to right when it is in the garden.
 Push it into the cork firmly, until it feels very secure.
 You want to insert them securely into the soil, but they do not need to reach the bottom.

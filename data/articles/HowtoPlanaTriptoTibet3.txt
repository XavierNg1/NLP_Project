 Depending on where you live, you may need to take a flight there. Note that getting to Tibet from Mainland China is more recommended as a Group Chinese Visa is necessary if you are entering from Nepal, but not from Mainland China.

By the way, despite the word "group" being in the name "Group Chinese Visa", you can still obtain one of those if you are a solo traveler on an organized tour.
 You can do this by either transportation or plane. If you'd rather fly, there is an option to fly from Kathmandu to Lhasa, which only takes an hour and 15 minutes. Alternatively, you could ask a travel agency in Nepal to cover for a private vehicle for you or travel by public bus to the Tibetan border. Note that regular tourist vehicles coming from Nepal do not go into Tibet, so a change of vehicles is necessary at the border., You can either go by plane or train. If you'd prefer a plane, try one of the direct flights to Lhasa from certain cities in China: Xining, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Beijing, X'ian, Kunming, etc. The most popular choices for flying to Lhasa are from Xining and Chengdu. You will need the permit that you applied for in order to fly to Lhasa; it will be mailed to you before you travel.

If you are taking the train, note the cities that you can travel from in China: Beijing, Shanghai, Chongding, Lanzhou, Xining and Chengdu. Xining is the best choice as it is the primary entrance to the Tibetan railway and the closest principal city to Lhasa.

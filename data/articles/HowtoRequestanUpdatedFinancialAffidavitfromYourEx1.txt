 If you think the affidavit is outdated, you should contact your ex and ask directly for an updated affidavit. If your ex has a lawyer, then call the lawyer. Remind them that your ex has a duty to continuously update the affidavit., Point to the information that you think is inaccurate. For example, your ex may have gotten a new job. When he or she filled out the initial affidavit, they might have been unemployed. Your ex has a duty to report the new income he or she is making.


It might be easiest to make a copy of the affidavit and highlight the information you think is outdated. You can then include this copy with a letter.
 It’s best to always communicate in writing, so that you have a paper record of having made a request. Set up your letter like a standard business letter. Address it to your ex’s attorney (or your ex if they don’t have an attorney).


Keep the letter short but professional. You can write, “Dear Mr. Smith, I heard from your sister the other week that you finally found a job after having lost your prior one. Unfortunately, the financial affidavit you filed in our divorce case is outdated. Please provide the court with an updated and accurate financial affidavit.”
To make things easier for your ex, you could insert a blank financial affidavit along with the letter. You can download a copy from the Internet.
Remember to mail the letter certified mail, return receipt requested. Hold onto the receipt., If your ex still won’t turn over an updated affidavit, then you should remind them at your next court hearing. Be sure to take copies of your letter with you to court. Your ex’s lawyer might not have shared the letter with your ex.


You can also tell the judge at your next hearing that the affidavit needs to be updated.

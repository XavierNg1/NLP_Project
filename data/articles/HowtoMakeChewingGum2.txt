 Place the wax in a double boiler. Put the double boiler on the stove and turn the burner to medium high. Melt the wax until it is soft and gooey.
 Place the honey in the pot and stir it into the melted wax. You can substitute corn syrup for honey if you prefer.
 Beeswax gum goes well with peppermint flavoring. You could also try cinnamon, lemon or licorice. Squeeze about five drops of flavoring into the pot with the melted wax and honey, and stir well.


You can add finely chopped herbs, such as rosemary or mint leaves, to the mixture.
For a medicinal gum, add extra peppermint oil and a few drops of lemon juice.
 Stir powdered sugar into the melted gum base. The mixture should begin to thicken a bit. Taste the gum mixture and add more flavorings or powdered sugar if you'd like to increase the flavor or sweetness.
 Use candy molds, an ice cube tray, or other small molds for the gum. Pour an equal amount of the gum base into each mold. Place the molds in the refrigerator to give the gum time to harden, then pop out the pieces when you're ready to chew them.

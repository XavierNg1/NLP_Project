 Powerball tickets can be bought in these establishments. For this reason, store owners usually help players keep track of the game.Powerball tickets cost $2 or $3, depending on whether you splurge for the “PowerPlay” option, which will multiply your winnings in the event of a match., In many cases, places that sell Powerball tickets will keep winning numbers posted on a small board so that players who purchased a ticket from these stores can come back and check the game’s status. Bring your ticket and ask to be directed to the corner of the store where results are posted.
 Check the posted winning numbers against your own ticket. Remember, you only need to match three out of the five white balls plus the Powerball to win. If you don’t hold the winning ticket, try your hand again and return once the next round of numbers is posted.

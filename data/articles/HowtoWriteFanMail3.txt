 An email should contain the same content as a written letter, but it should be a little bit shorter. Like written letters, the person may have a special email address for fan mail. Visit the person's website and look for an area that says something similar to "contact me."


Limit your email to 4 or 5 sentences.
If the person does not have website, visit one of their social media pages and look for their contact information.
 Another way to contact a celebrity is by commenting on their social media posts. Instagram and Facebook allow you to comment on particular posts. You will not be able to write as much as you would in a letter, but this is a quick way to show your appreciation.


Look through previous posts to find out if the celebrity usually responds to and interacts with fans. If this is the case, you may be able to get a response.
Even if the person does not respond to your comment, they may read what you wrote.
You may get a quicker response by interacting with the person through social media than through sending a written letter., You can send the person a direct message on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. If you do not want other people to see what you write, this is the best way to go. Keep your message short and to the point.


Do not bombard the person with direct messages every single day. This will not make them respond to you.
Also, do not contact a person using all of the methods at once. For example, do not comment, send an email, and send a direct message. This can make you look bad.

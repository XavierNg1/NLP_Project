Bikram yoga can help you shed some unwanted water weight.

Put away your cell phone and turn off the television set. Set the table, even if you're eating alone, so you can focus solely on the food.
Eat slowly. You want to make sure you savor each bite and enjoy the texture and flavor of the food. Try to chew each bite very slowly and pay attention to how the food tastes in your mouth, as well as the textures. Try taking smaller bites and pausing between bites to think.
Think about the food you're eating. Try to be aware of where it came from. Who grew these vegetables? Think about the farms from which animal products came. Try to think about food as sustaining and nourishing rather than a convenience or a splurge.

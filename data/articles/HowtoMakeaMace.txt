 The haft of your mace is the long piece which serves as both a handle and an anchor point for the weighted end. The best material you can choose for the haft's construction is steel. A 3/4" pipe nipple about 18–24 inches (45.7–61.0 cm) long with a threaded cap at one end would work well, as will an old piece of rebar about 3/4" wide.;
, A good mace head should be relatively compact and very dense to give best results.


A very simple option for making a mace head without access to a workshop is to make a wound wire mace.

To do this you'll need several lead weights (Ideally the ones used for balancing car wheels) and a long piece of wire, preferably steel.
Simply place the lead weights against haft, under the edge of the cap if you used a piece of pipe, running length ways along it and slowly begin to wrap the wire around them, being sure to keep as much tension on it as possible to create as tight of a hold as possible.
Build up this wire till the mace head is as heavy as you would like it to be.
To secure the wire, you can use a two layer wrap of duct tape or a hose clamp to hold down the end of the wire.



To make a simple grip, wrap layers of duct tape around the haft until it is a proper fit for your hand.
For a better grip, take a piece of rope approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm), knot each end and play about four inches of it against the haft length ways and wrap a piece of duct tape around it to secure it. Repeat the same step with the other end of the rope, opposite side of the pipe from the first. After this, wrap the duct tape around until the handle is built up enough to fit your hand comfortably. By doing this, you are making the handle an oval, which will rest more comfortably in your hand, and giving yourself a lanyard, so even if you lose your grip, the mace will not fly out of reach.

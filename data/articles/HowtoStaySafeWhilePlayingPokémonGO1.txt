 The surest way to protect yourself from malware is to download the game from a fully reliable source; while waiting for Google Play to make the game available in your region may not be as exciting as finding a third-party source, it is certainly the most secure way to get the game.;
, If you are an Android user and intend to download the game by sideloading instead of through the Play Store, you may be at risk of having your phone be infected by malware. Before downloading the app from a third-party site, you should:


Check external reviews of the site to see if other people have experienced issues.
Avoid sites that appear to market to consumers trying to circumvent legality.
 After downloading the APK file, you can still "vet" it before potentially malicious software has the opportunity to infect your Android. Download a reliable virus detector for Android and follow the instructions for scanning a new application. If the detector finds any dangerous content on the APK, delete the file. Reliable virus detectors include:VirusTotal
AndroTotal
NVISO ApkScan
OPSWAT

, Because Pokémon GO is a game that uses your location and other personal data to link you to other players and to the world of the game, it will ask you for certain information by default. However, malware will ask for other unnecessary information that can be used to invade your phone. Go to "App Info" from the home screen and delete an app that asks for any of the following permissions:Directly call phone numbers
Edit or read your text messages
Record audio
Modify your contacts, read or write your call log, or read your contacts
Read your web bookmarks or history
Change your network connectivity or connect/disconnect from WiFi
Retrieve running apps at startup

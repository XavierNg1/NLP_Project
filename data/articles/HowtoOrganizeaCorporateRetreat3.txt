 This might be the CEO, a member of your leadership team or an outside consultant.


Utilize a facilitator who is trained in group processes and has conducted retreats, trainings or development sessions before. A professional facilitator can remain neutral and really help your company put a plan in place to achieve your goals.
Prepare your facilitator by sharing company background as well as the goals and the purpose of the retreat.



Be mindful of the time. You do not want to keep people later than you have scheduled them. Put together an agenda that focuses on the specific goals in the time allotted.
Distribute the agenda ahead of time. Giving everyone a chance to review the agenda before the retreat will help them feel more prepared.
 As the retreat unfolds, it can be tempting to go off on tangents or start discussing business that is not on the agenda.
 Assign someone to take notes and distribute those notes immediately after the retreat.


Document next steps as well. Having a list of action items will keep everyone engaged even after the retreat, and hold people accountable for what they agreed to do.

When you complain, you expose your child to the stress of adulthood, which could lead them to believe that things can’t get better.Instead of dwelling on what’s wrong, try to strategize a solution and express to your children that you are optimistic and confident your plan will work. If you can’t, direct your attention to the things that are going right.
You can also model an optimistic outlook for your child by talking about things you are looking forward to.
 No matter how positive you are, if your relatives or close friends have a negative attitude, it can still rub off on your child. What’s more, even if your children are never around these people, they can still be exposed to the pessimism because it may rub off on you. Build a support network of positive, cheerful people. Limit your time around pessimistic, Debby-downers.
 If you struggle with depression as a parent, it’s much harder to provide a positive interpretation of life events. Viewing the world through the lens of depression can cause your child to develop negative interpretations, too. If you have depression, get the treatment you need so that your family can have a healthy and happy outlook.

, Using a pastry brush, spread melted butter over your baking pan.
 In a mixing bowl, stir the cake mix, egg, and vegetable oil together with a rubber spatula or whisk. Take caution not to over-mix as this causes your brownies to be rubbery.
 Milk is the key ingredient to this recipe, because the amount you put will determine the moistness of your brownies. Too much milk will cause the brownies to come out tasting more like a cake. Mix again with the rubber spatula. The batter should be slightly thick but still liquid.
 The tasty and colorful part! Pour both ingredients in your batter and mix until well-combined.
 Scrape any remaining batter with a rubber spatula. Lightly sprinkle some more sprinkles on top.
 The edges should be brown when your brownies are ready.
 This step is extremely important and should not be skipped. Immediately after you take your brownies out, do not slice them, instead give them the time to cool. Your brownies should still be slightly gooey right after they come out of the oven.
 Use a knife to cut the brownies into squares. They are ready to serve.

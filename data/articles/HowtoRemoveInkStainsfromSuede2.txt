 It can be an eraser made of rubber, vinyl, or art gum. The important thing is to make sure your eraser is white (or tan if it's made of art gum). Erasers that are dyed bright colors like pink can create an even worse stain.Suede cleaning kits are often sold with a special suede eraser., Press the eraser against the stained suede and rub it just like you were erasing pencil off of paper. Apply strong pressure to the eraser as you rub. Erasers are gentle and unlikely to damage the suede.


Keep going back and forth with the eraser until the stain either is completely lifted or stops getting lighter.
Depending on how badly your suede is stained, this step may take a long time. You may also end up needing to use a second eraser if the first is completely worn down.
Brush off the residue when you're finished., If the stain persists after your eraser stops being effective, you will need to remove the rest of it with a suede-safe solvent:


Soak a soft bristle brush with either rubbing alcohol or white vinegar.
Scrub the stain gently with the brush. To avoid abrading the suede, use only a very light amount of pressure.
For stubborn stains, alternating between rounds of erasing and brushing may give you the best results.
Run a clean toothbrush over the area once the stain has been completely removed. This will help to restore your suede to its proper texture.

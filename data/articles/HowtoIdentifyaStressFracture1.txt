 Pain is the most common symptom of stress fracture, especially pain directly on the affected area. Although pain from a stress fracture can be barely noticeable at first, it tends to become unbearable over time.


Especially consider pain that intensifies upon weight bearing activity and exercise and subsides with proper rest.
The pain may be sharp, pulsating and excruciating.;
, If inflammation or bruising is present at the site of pain, this indicates the possibility of a stress fracture.


Inflammation results from the bodyâ€™s immune system releasing inflammatory chemicals in order to remove harmful stimuli, including damaged cells, irritants, or pathogens and begin the healing process. Bruises appear when the blood vessels break because of force or blow to the skin. Blood leaks out of the blood vessels and results in a red, black or purple skin mark.
 Localized tenderness is tenderness that usually originates from a specific spot and decreases during rest. Tenderness or a feeling of a palpitating soft object can be due to inflammation in the affected area.
 When the muscle fibers in the injured area stretch or tear due to stress fracture, these muscle fibers contract and tighten. This contraction results in insufficient blood flow to the affected area. Reduced blood flow can lead to spasms and a funny feeling or numbness in the affected area.

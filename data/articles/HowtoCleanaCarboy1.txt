 In order to clean a carboy, you should pour about two tablespoons (or slightly more) of cleaner into the bottom of the carboy. OxiClean and Powdered Brewing Wash (PBW) are both excellent products for cleaning carboys. Then, fill the carboy with warm water.If you are using a plastic carboy, you should dissolve your cleaner in warm water before pouring it into the bottle. These cleaners can be powerful and the powder may corrode the plastic if not diluted first.;
, Let the hot water and cleaner mixture soak in the carboy for approximately one hour. This will help to loosen any grime or krausen that may be stuck to the side of the carboy. Krausen is a grimy ring often left near the top of carboys., After an hour, pour out half of the liquid mixture. Then, place the lid on the carboy and shake the container. Swivel the water around so that it washes along all the sides of the carboy. This will help remove any grime that is attached to the walls.Shake for approximately 30 seconds or until the carboy is cleaned.
 Dump the cleaner and water mixture down the drain and then rinse with clean warm water. This will help remove all remaining cleaner from the carboy., You can repeat this process a few times, until all visible grime has been removed from the carboy. In some cases, you may need to do this three or four times.

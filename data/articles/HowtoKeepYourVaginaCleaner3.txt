 Yeast infection is a common vaginal infection caused by an overgrowth of Candida albicans yeast.Overgrowth of Candida albicans can happen due to antibiotic use, pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes, impaired immune system or changes in your normal vaginal flora.
Symptoms of yeast infection include itching and burning, painful urination, gray or white vaginal discharge that is thick, pain during sex, and redness/swelling of the vulva.Yeast infection can be treated with antifungal ointment, tablet or suppository, such as butoconazole (Gynazole-1), miconazole (Monistat 3), clotrimazole (Gyne-Lotrimin), and terconazole (Terazol 3).In severe cases, your doctor may prescribe an oral antifungal medication called fluconazole (Diflucan).
Reduce your risk of yeast infection by avoiding douching, wear loose-fitting pants, avoid pantyhose, and change wet clothes as soon as possible., This condition is caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina and is the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44.Bacterial vaginosis is thought to result from imbalance in the normal vaginal bacteria. New or multiple sexual partners and douching may disrupt the balance and lead to switching from “good” to “harmful” bacteria.Bacterial vaginosis may be symptomless or you may notice white/gray vaginal discharge, pain or burning, or fish-like odor. Itching inside and outside the vagina may also occur.
Bacterial vaginosis may make you more prone to sexually transmitted diseases.
Sometimes this condition can go away without treatment but your doctor may also prescribe antibiotics. Best way to prevent bacterial vaginosis is to maintain proper vaginal hygiene that supports normal healthy bacterial balance., STDs are bacterial, viral or parasitic infections are transferred from partner to partner during unprotected sex. More than 20 types of STDs are known (such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, and trichomoniasis).Many STDs can be symptomless but if you do experience symptoms they may include unpleasant odor, white, clear, yellow, or green vaginal discharge, itching, and painful urination.Some bacterial and parasitic STDs can be treated with antibiotics whereas others have no cure, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and genital herpes, but can be managed with medications.If you suspect you have an STD, contact your doctor immediately and/or make an appointment for testing.

 Traveling with your dog does require a bit of planning, but it is fully possible to do so. Accommodations are especially important to plan, as many hotels and rental facilities do not allow dogs. Always ask about pet policies before booking a stay when traveling with your dog., Even if you bring a crate along, do not assume it is safe or appropriate to leave your dog in a hotel room or rented space. Leaving them somewhere they aren’t comfortable will likely lead to some barking, howling, or worse.When you’re in a hotel room together, turn the TV or radio on low. Select a station with calm, familiar sounds. This will help cover the sounds of other guests, and help reduce the likelihood that Jim Har-Paw will be tempted to bark.
 When traveling with your dog, it’s important to ensure they are as comfortable as possible. Outside of keeping as much of a routine as you can, the best way to do so is by bringing along their favorite toys, blankets, and food., Many popular travel destinations provide information on places you can stay with your pet, as well as activities you can enjoy together. This include both specific destinations, such as cities or national parks, as well as general destinations.Often, local, state, or national governments will make this information available online. For instance, if you live in or are visiting a particular U.S. state, visit the state’s tourism website to find or ask about a pet-friendly travel guide.
Aside from hotels, information is available regarding pet-friendly vacation rentals, beaches, airports, shopping malls, and more.
 There are various types of dog “camps.” Some revolve around a particular event or activity, such as a sport or skills competition. Others are more social and are designed to host you, your dog, and other campers in a place that can accommodate both bipeds and canines. Make sure to opt for the sort of camp that hosts both you and your dog.

 Choose a small- to medium-sized plastic planting pot with drainage holes.;
, Saguaro, like other cacti, need extremely loose, loamy and coarse soil that is free of organic fertilizers like manure.


Combine 1-part each of sand, peat moss, turf soil and garden loam.
Fill the pot 3/4 full of soil.
 Poke several small holes in the soil 1 inch (2.54 cm) apart using a pencil. Make the holes about 1/8 inch (0.4 cm) deep. Place the saguaro seeds in the holes and lightly pinch the soil closed over them.
 Place plastic wrap securely over the pot. Poke holes in the plastic wrap to aerate the soil.
, Sprinkle water over the soil every 10 days so the seeds don't dry out. Even when growing from seed, cacti do not like too much water, so do not water more than every 10 days.
 After 4 to 6 weeks, you will be able to remove the plastic wrap. Keep the saguaro seedlings moist by watering once a month.

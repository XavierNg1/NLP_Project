 A good way to prevent future infestations is to make sure that you do not have an accumulation of water near your homeâ€™s foundations as this a prime habitat for subterranean termites. You can divert water with effective guttering, and by using devices such as downspouts and splash blocks.This also applies for any mulch or wet garden materials which could be attractive to termites., Certain structural deficiencies can play a major part in heightening the chances of you suffering an infestation. Remedying these can be an effective long-term action which limits the probabilities of subterranean termites appearing. As the termites tend to enter where wood touches soil, you should have a clearance of at least twelve inches between wood at the base of your house and the soil. This also applies for porches or decking areas, where you should not have the wood directly on the soil.
 A warm and humid environment in the dark areas of your house, such as crawl spaces, attics, and basements can be very inviting for termites. For subterranean termites, your basement or cellar will be a particularly popular area. You can make these areas less hospitable for termites by ensuring they are well ventilated to avoid those warm and humid conditions.

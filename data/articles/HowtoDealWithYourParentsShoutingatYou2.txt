 Shouting makes people angry, so revisiting the problem in 20 minutes or even the next morning is sometimes the only way to calm down.If your parents think you are just avoiding them, tell them you need a break.


Say, “Can we please talk about this in a half an hour?”
Ask politely, “Please, can I sit in the other room for a few minutes?”
Tell them, “I really want to talk about this tomorrow.”

, Regain control of yourself by breathing deeply. The best way to do this is to go in a different room away from your parents. Sit in a chair with your back straight, and breath in through your nose for 5 or 6 seconds. Then, hold the breath for one second, and breathe out slowly for 7 seconds. Repeat this 10 times., Be sure to ask your parents for permission—don’t just run out of the house.

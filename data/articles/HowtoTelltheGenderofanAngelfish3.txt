 When purchasing your first set of angelfish, consider buying 4-6 different juvenile fish and putting them together in a tank. Make sure the tank has adequate space for all the fish. When selecting your fish, consider picking a few fish that are on the smaller side, and a few that are a little larger. This might increase your chances of them being different genders and eventually pairing to spawn., Once the fish are mature—usually once they are between 6 and 12 months old—they will pair off to spawn. At this time, start keeping a close eye on them to see their behaviors. Not only will you be more likely to see their spawning tubes at that point, but you will be able to see which fish pair off to spawn together.


Observe these behaviors carefully, though—sometimes fish of the same gender will try to spawn, unsuccessfully of course.
Sometimes spawning pairs of angelfish will “kiss” or lock lips. Sometimes this lip locking can be quick and cute, or even a little aggressive, with the fish chasing one another around the tank., Once your fish have paired to spawn, you should be able to determine which fish are female and which are male based on their pairings. This might not be the most efficient way to tell the gender of an angelfish, but since the sexing of angelfish is an imprecise process, it’s one of the most accurate.You may actually observe a female angelfish laying her eggs with careful observation. Keep in mind, though, that even some of the most experienced angelfish breeders and keepers have trouble distinguishing the genders.

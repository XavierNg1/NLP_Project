 At most, you should carry a cell phone, mp3 player, watch, and wallet. Excessive jewelry or accessory is a dead giveaway.;
, Not only do they label you as "Rich", but they also make you a target in the eyes of a criminal. Average, everyday clothes will do.
 Carry only what you need, and keep the rest in a bank account or at home. If you do want to carry cash on hand, keep at just enough to buy small quantities of food, and cab fare.
 Otherwise, keep all credit cards at home, at all times. Not only will this help if you ever have to pull out your wallet, but protect yourself from impulse buys.
 Not only will this save you gas money, but prevent you from being seen with an "expensive" car. Once again, this will also make you a less likely target of thieves. Mass Transit (Bus, Carpool) is an advisable substitute.
 Telling someone that you have a lot of money will give it away.

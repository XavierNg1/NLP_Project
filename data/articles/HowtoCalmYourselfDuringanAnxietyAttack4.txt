 If you have severe panic attacks over an extended period of time, visit a local mental health professional for therapy and advice. You may have panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, both of which can be treated by a trained professional.


One of the most common and effective treatments for anxiety disorders is Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This type of therapy focuses on teaching you to identify and alter unhelpful ways of thinking and reacting to situations. You learn how to recognize when your thoughts are not aligned with fact and how to practice helpful ways of thinking and reaction.In some cases, your physician or psychiatrist may prescribe an anxiety-controlling medication if other means of controlling your panic don’t seem to have an effect., In some communities it can be hard to find a licensed mental health professional, especially if you’re on a low income or have a restrictive insurance plan. While most medical doctors cannot offer psychotherapy -- the exception being psychiatrists -- they can usually diagnose some issues, such as anxiety and depression, and prescribe medications.


Family doctors can also provide referrals to mental health providers in your area.
 If you think you cannot afford therapy, look in your community for low-cost options. There are several types of options that you may find.A federally funded health center may offer mental health treatment. You can search for a center here.
Ask therapists about sliding scales. Some therapists and clinics will offer a “sliding fee scale,” meaning that your fee is based on your income.
Many colleges and universities offer mental health services. Sometimes these are reserved for students, but some larger universities may also offer community clinics where mental health students in training can provide services under professional supervision. These clinics tend to be quite inexpensive.

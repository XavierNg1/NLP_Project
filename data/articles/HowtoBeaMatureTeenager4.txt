 Lots of adolescents and teens communicate in a style that leaves teachers and parents scratching their heads. If you want to be viewed as mature, you should speak in a way that others understand. Use proper words, not shorthand or acronyms. Write in complete sentences with proper spelling.


If you want to learn appropriate ways to engage in conversation with others, ask your parents to role-play communication with you., Many teens assume they know everything, so they don’t want to listen to others. A sign of maturity is knowing that you can learn something from everyone. Try to listen more than you speak.A good rule-of-thumb is to listen to understand rather than listening to reply. Try to figure out what the other person is trying to say. Don’t interrupt or rush to get your message across. Fully hear them out. Then, try to summarize what you think they said.
For instance, your mom says, “I’ll be out of town this weekend and I’m concerned about leaving you at home alone. I think you should try to stay with the Woodards.” You might respond, “I can see you are worried about me being here by myself. I agree. I will see if Pat’s parents don’t mind me staying over.”

, Using slang or other popular terms strictly in the presence of peers is okay. But, when you are communicating with adults, try to use words in their proper form. Don’t try to talk over adults heads by using terms they aren’t familiar with. Also, avoid using swear words, which is a sign of disrespect.

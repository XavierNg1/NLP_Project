 Squeeze a dollop of shampoo onto your hand, then quickly and thoroughly mix it into your hair. Let it sit for thirty seconds while you wash your body or perform another shower task. Then, wash the shampoo out while you squeeze a bit of conditioner into your palm. Run the conditioner through your hair, then let it sit for up to a minute as you shave, exfoliate, or perform another shower task. Wash the conditioner of your hair and get out of the shower.

It may be easier to shower quickly if you don't need to take the time to apply and rinse out two separate hair-care products., Long or thick hair may take more time to wash than shorter cuts. If your shower has a nozzle with adjustable water pressure, turn on a jet stream so the water sprays harder. The more quickly your hair gets wet, the more quickly you can wash it.

Use a shower cap to keep the moisture out, or simply hold your hair out of the shower stream.

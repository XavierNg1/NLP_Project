 It should be right when you get home, so you don't forget. Or if you think better after the day is done, you can try after dinner. But be careful not to do it too late.
 If you are struggling to remember, set an alarm on your phone, computer, game system, etc. so you won't lose track of time with technology.
 Leave a sticky note on your mirror saying when a project is due. When you get an assignment at school, write a note and leave it in one of your homework books, so when you open it, the reminder is seen.
 Ask him/her to call/text you the night before something is due to remind you. A good friend would be happy to help.
 Maybe three clubs, basketball, and student council is too much.
 It may take weeks, but soon you will get into a rhythm that is hard to break.

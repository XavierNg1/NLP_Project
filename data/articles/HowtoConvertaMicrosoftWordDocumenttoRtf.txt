 Of course, in order to make the conversion you must be able to open the file in an application capable of reading .doc files.;
, If you are using Microsoft Word 2007 or later, this option should be under the button/tab that looks like the Microsoft Windows logo.
 Click on the drop down menu and select the option marked “Rich Text Format (.rtf)” instead.
 Choose where you want the file to be saved and name it whatever you want (for instance, ConvertingDocToRTF.rtf). Then click the save button and voila! Now your .doc file is also saved in Rich Text Format.

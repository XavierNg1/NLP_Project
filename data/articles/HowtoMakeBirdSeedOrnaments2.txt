 Non-stick foil works especially well, but standard aluminum foil can also work.
 Make sure that the interior sides are well-coated.
 Wrap the foil up around the sides of the cookie cutter, tightly forming it to the shape of the mold and covering the exterior sides.
 Heat and stir the coconut oil until it melts but does not bubble or boil.
 Mix well with a heat-resistant spoon until the seed and nuts are evenly distributed throughout the oil.
 The oil should be cool enough to prevent burns but not so cool that it solidifies.
 Position the twine toward the top of the cookie cutter rather than in the center. Most of the twine should hang out over the edge of the cookie cutter.
 Do this slowly to prevent spillage or burns, and allow the seed mixture to nearly reach the top of the mold.
 Do not refrigerate or freeze yet.
 Allow it to remain in the freezer for an hour.
 Hang it outside using the twine.

 This is the first step and should be danced quickly on the first beat. The basic dance is composed of four steps, two quick and then two slow. The slow steps will be held twice as long as the quick ones. These are counted in beats, similar to other dances and music. , This step should be danced quickly on the second beat.
 This step, however, should be a slow step instead of the quick step done in Step 1.
 Again, this step should be slow instead of quick.
 The steps above will follow what is called the line of dance. This is an imaginary line around the outside of a dance floor. The faster you intend to dance, the further towards the outside you should be. Line of dance moves counterclockwise.


It is important, when dancing with other couples, to maintain the line of dance. This keeps you from bumping into others and hurting yourself or them.

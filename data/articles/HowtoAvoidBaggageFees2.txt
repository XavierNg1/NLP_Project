 Help keep yourself consolidated to a smaller bag by packing items that can be used for multiple purposes. Instead of packing separate slacks and jeans, for example, consider bringing a single pair of black denim pants that can be used in a work environment as well as for casual or more physical activities.Try to pack clothing that is multi-functional. Take a look at your closet and think about what pieces you use for multiple occasions. Pack those rather than pieces that only serve one purpose whenever possible., If you are going to be gone for multiple weeks or longer, donâ€™t pack a new outfit for every day you will be gone. Instead, look into laundromats or hotel laundry service at your destination. Paying to wash your clothes a couple times will still generally be more affordable than paying baggage fees., Rather than bringing a full bottle of shampoo that you will need to check, consider buying travel sized toiletries and hygiene items. These are typically readily found in most supermarkets and drug stores, and can spare you both weight and space in your bag.Even a carry-on-sized bag may need to be checked if you have full-sized containers of items like shampoo, lotion, or even toothpaste. If you can manage with travel-sized items at your destination, invest in them.
Likewise, you can purchase travel-sized, reusable bottles to pack smaller amounts of your own toiletries if you would rather bring your own products with you.
 A common traveler tip to help get more items into a smaller bag is to roll your clothes. This allows you to fit more than folding, helping you pack a denser bag.To roll a shirt, fold the arms into the body, then fold the shirt in half. From there, roll from the neck down to the base, squeezing as you go to create the tightest roll.

 You may have heard the saying “It’s the little things.” Telling your parents that you love them on a regular basis can warm their hearts; however, doing little caring things, when they least expect you to, will show them that you truly do love them.


Write them a brief love note, send a thoughtful text message, or give them a touching greeting card on an ordinary day.
Arrange to spend some quality time with them.If they are feeling “under the weather” offer to help nurse them back to health.
 Just like you’re not perfect, you’re parents are not perfect either. They are human. They also struggle with various things, and can often be under a lot of stress. You can bring them joy by simply embracing them.


Allow them to make mistakes.
Avoid judging them.
Make sure that you forgive them.
Encourage them every opportunity that you get.
 Teenagers are notorious for feeling awkward and uncomfortable with displaying affection for a parent. But sometimes just a touch can go a long way with a parent. You’re never too young or too old to be affectionate with your parents.


Surprise them with a kiss goodnight.
Give them a warm hug when they least expect it.
Wrap your arm around your father. Hold your mother’s hand as she’s walking.

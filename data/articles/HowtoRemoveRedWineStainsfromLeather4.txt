 Make a solution of roughly equal parts water and white vinegar. If in doubt, err on the side of too much water.If you have it, add a few drops of leather cleaner to the solution.
 Gently massage a thin layer of the mixture into the stain with a clean rag or towel. Let it sit for at least 10 minutes, up to an hour.
 Wet a clean rag, and gently blot away the vinegar solution with one corner. Then use another clean corner to do a second wipe, to ensure the mixture has been completely removed. Pat it dry with a clean paper towel. Let it dry for at least 24 hours.
 Use a soft cloth to rub a small amount of leather conditioner into the affected area. This will help restore the leatherâ€™s texture. Let it dry again.

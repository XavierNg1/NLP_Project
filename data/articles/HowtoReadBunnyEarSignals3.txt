 When your rabbitâ€™s ears are standing straight up in the air or are twitching, they are listening attentively for something. This generally means that they are alert and aware of something in their surroundings., When your rabbit has one ear standing straight up and the other lying down, it is listening for sounds, but also trying to relax. This is common for a bunny that is enjoying some sun., When rabbits are interested in something, they will often stand on all fours and stretch their tail and their head out. Their nose and ears will be stretched out forward to inspect what is in front of them.

 Creditors can generally only garnish your wages once they have obtained a court judgment stating that you owe the money to that particular creditor.In order to accomplish this, a creditor will have to file a lawsuit against you and go through the court process in order to get their judgment. However, there are a few exceptions when a creditor can garnish your wages without a court order.These exceptions include debts from unpaid income taxes, court ordered child support, child support arrears, and defaulted student loans., After a creditor receives a court order allowing them to garnish your wages, they must provide you with notice before they begin garnishing your wages.This notice will be in the form of an Earnings Withholding Order as well other documents explaining exemptions (i.e., Employee Instructions). The notice must contain the following information:


A statement that informs you in simple terms the nature of your wage garnishment;
A statement that you have the right to an exemption in certain circumstances;
The procedure for claiming an exemption; and
The amount the creditor will be garnishing and how that amount was calculated., If a creditor obtains the proper authorization to garnish your wages, they can only take a certain portion of your disposable earnings.Disposable earnings are the wages you have left after legally required deductions are made.Legally required deductions include federal, state, and local taxes; and the employee's share of State Unemployment Insurance and Social Security.Deductions such as voluntary wage assignments, union dues, health and life insurance, and contributions to charitable causes are not usually legally required and therefore may be included in the definition of disposable earnings., Once a creditor has determined your disposable earnings, the amount they may garnish in any given workweek is the lesser of 25% of your disposable earnings, or the amount by which your disposable earnings exceed 40 times your state's minimum hourly wage.For example, lets assume you earn $1,000 per week and your disposable earnings are $700 after all required deductions, and the current minimum wage is $8.00. When you multiply $8.00 by 40, you get $320. When you take 25% of $700, you get $175. As a result, a creditor could garnish your wages in the amount of either $175 or $380 ($700 minus $320), whichever amount is less. Therefore, in this scenario, a creditor could garnish your wages in the amount of $175 per week.If your wages are being garnished due to unpaid child support, a creditor does not need a court order to garnish your wages and that creditor can take up to 50% of your disposable earnings if you are currently supporting a child or spouse who isn't the subject of the intended child support payments.If you are not currently supporting any children or spouses, a creditor can take up to 60% of your disposable earnings.If you are in default on your student loans, a creditor can take up to 15% of your disposable earnings but cannot take more than 30 times the minimum wage.When you are delinquent on your taxes, the amount a creditor can garnish will depend on how many dependents you have and what your deduction rate is., When you receive notice of a wage garnishment and/or see your wages being garnished, do some research and make sure the creditor is following the law. Check and see if the amount of wages being garnished are lawful, make sure you received the proper notice, and make sure your disposable earnings were calculated correctly.


If you believe your wages are being improperly garnished, follow Part 2.
If your wages are being garnished properly but they are causing you to be burdened financially, choose one or more of the options below (Parts 3, 4, or 5) in order to have the garnishments reduced or stopped.
 Once you receive your Earnings Withholding Order and other instructions, and you determine your wages have been improperly garnished, contact the court that handled your case and file any objections in writing.Often, when you receive notice of the garnishment, included in your package will be directions on how to challenge the garnishment order.If, however, there are no instructions included, call the California superior court that handled your matter in order to obtain directions. The court's contact information will be on the Earnings Withholding Order.


Common objections include claiming the creditor is taking too much money, claiming the creditor did not follow the proper procedures, or claiming you have already paid the debt in question., Once you have filed your objections with the court, a hearing date will be set.Attend this hearing and lay out the reasons why the creditor's garnishments are improper.Even if a court determines the wage garnishments are proper, attending this hearing will give you an opportunity to approach your creditor and ask to negotiate., If the reason you are disputing the wage garnishment is procedural (i.e., you did not receive notice of the lawsuit, you were never served with other necessary documents), then you may be able to vacate the judgment in favor of your creditor by filing a motion.In order to do this, you are likely going to need a qualified attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, trying going to your local legal aid office as they usually handle these types of cases on a daily basis.
 One of the quickest and most effective ways to stop or reduce a wage garnishment is to contact the creditor yourself. Listed on the Earnings Withholding Order is the contact information for the creditor or their attorneys.Call them and tell them you would like to negotiate the garnishment. Creditors get these calls all the time and they are usually responsive to your needs.
 Once you contact the creditor, set up a time to meet and negotiate your garnishment. If you cannot meet with them in person, they may be willing to do it over the phone. When you are negotiating, tell the creditor why you believe the amount being garnished should be lowered or stopped altogether. Common reasons include:


A financial hardship. This may mean that you are needing your disposable earnings to pay for housing, food, and/or other basic living expenses. If this is the case, bring evidence of these expenses and let the creditor know their garnishment is interfering with your ability to pay for basic necessities.
An improper garnishment. Before you formally object to a garnishment in court, you may contact the creditor and ask them to stop the garnishment on their own in order to avoid court proceedings.
 Once you have come to an agreement with the creditor, set up a payment arrangement and ensure the creditor follows that payment arrangement. A payment agreement usually involves a promise on your part to pay an agreed upon monthly payment, which will be less than the court ordered garnishment amount.


These types of agreements are fairly common so do not feel intimidated or hesitant to call your creditor. They deal with these issues daily and they should be happy to accommodate you if they can.
 The most common option for getting a creditor's garnishment stopped or reduced is to to file a claim of exemption. In California, a claim of exemption can be filed if you need your earnings to support yourself or your family.However, you will not receive an exemption if you use your earnings for luxuries that are not necessary for support, if you owe an attorney because of a court order in a family law case, if you owe the debt for past due child or spousal support, or if you owe the debt to a former employee for wages.To file a claim of exemption, fill out this form as well as this form. The first form is a claim of exemption and asks you to state the earnings you need to support yourself and your family.This form will also ask you to provide an amount of money you could withhold in order to satisfy your creditor.The other form is a financial statement, which requires you to divulge everything about the money you make and how it is spent.This will act as your evidence that you need your money for support.
 Once you fill out the claim of exemption and financial statement, you will need to mail or deliver your original plus one copy to the levying officer in your case.This will be the marshal, sheriff, or other process server that issued the Earnings Withholding Order.Make sure you keep a copy of these forms for yourself as well., Once you have filed your claim of exemption, you will need to wait for a response. While you are waiting, the employer that is paying you will have to continue to comply with the wage garnishment order, but those wages being garnished will be held until your claim of exemption is decided.If the creditor does not oppose your claim of exemption, after ten days the levying officer will tell your employer to stop withholding your wages or withhold less.If the creditor does oppose your claim of exemption, you will receive a Notice of Opposition and a Notice of Hearing. These documents will set a court date for a judge to make a decision.Read the Notice of Hearing carefully as it will tell you if the creditor will be showing up at the hearing or not.You do not need to go to the hearing if you are willing to have the court make a decision based on your claim of exemption and financial statement.If you go to the hearing, take bills, paycheck stubs, cancelled checks, and other evidence and witnesses that will help you prove that you need your earnings to support yourself or your family.At the hearing, the judge will make a final decision.If the judge agrees with you, he or she will sign of on having your wage garnishment stopped or reduced.If the judge agrees with your creditor, your employer will be required to continue to withhold the earnings on behalf of your creditor., Bankruptcy is a court proceeding that helps you get rid of your debt and repay your creditors.In a bankruptcy proceeding, most or all of your assets will be liquidated (sold off and turned into money) and the money earned will go to pay off your creditors.There are certain rules regarding debts that will be paid off and debts that will simply be wiped out.Once you have completed the bankruptcy proceedings, you will start over without the financial burdens you had before bankruptcy.
 If you are trying to stop a wage garnishment, filing for bankruptcy may be one way to completely wipe out the debt in question and it will certainly act to stop the garnishment, at least while you are going through the bankruptcy process.To file for bankruptcy, you will have to follow the process found here.


Once you file for bankruptcy, an automatic stay will go into effect, which prohibits and stops most collection activities.This means your wage garnishments should be stopped until you complete the bankruptcy process.Be aware that if your wages are being garnished for the purpose of child support or alimony, the automatic stay will not stop these garnishments.These types of garnishments are considered priority debts and will not be stopped., Once you go through the bankruptcy process, the court will either discharge your debts or dismiss the case.If the debt that is the source of your garnishment is discharged (wiped out or paid off using assets liquidated during the bankruptcy), once the bankruptcy is completed your garnishment will not continue.However, if your case gets dismissed without the debt being discharged, the garnishment will continue once the automatic stay is lifted.

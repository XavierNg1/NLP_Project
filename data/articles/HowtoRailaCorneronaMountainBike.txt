 Does it have a berm? Does it get sharper further in the corner? Is it a switchback? How grippy is the dirt? Are their any obstacles immediately after the corner?;
, You should never use your brakes in the corner, your bike will either stand up or wash out, so make sure that you have slowed down to a comfortable speed prior to beginning the turn.
 The key to railing corners on a mountain bike is commitment - if you think you might not make the corner, you probably won't.
 Crouch down, put your weight onto your outside pedal, hold the bars loosely, and lean the bike more than your body. Look past the exit of the corner.

 Unlike schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder, those with schizoid personality disorder do not experience hallucinations or unusual paranoia.While those with schizoid PD tend to have elaborate fantasy lives and daydream about them, they are fully aware that these are fantasies.
Fantasy lives and real lives do not blend into each other like they do for those with more severe forms of schizophrenia.
 While people with schizoid PD tend to speak flatly, with a complete lack of emotional expression, they are able to carry on a conversation that others can follow, whereas schizophrenics are not.This ability also distinguishes schizoid PD from autism, in which affected individuals may have limited communication abilities and exhibit uncommon non-verbal behaviors (e.g. stimming).Being quiet is a possible symptom of schizoid PD, but erratic or dissociative speech may denote a more severe form of schizophrenia.
“Eccentric” behavior is defined as slightly odd or uncommon, often in a humorous manner.Schizophrenic speech is illogical and statements may be difficult to understand., People with schizoid PD fail to display any emotions—positive or negative. They may recognize emotions in others, but cannot relate to them and do not know how to respond in a socially acceptable manner.Autistic people may not recognize some types of emotion in others, but tend to feel and express certain emotions frequently themselves.
Those with antisocial PD, often called sociopathy, do not actually feel emotions but are able to mimic them and rationalize even inappropriate reactions.
 Those with schizoid PD are able to maintain steady employment, unlike people with delusional disorders, like schizophrenia, and cluster B disorders, like antisocial personality disorder. They tend to choose jobs where they work alone, but are generally reliable enough to show up and do the minimal required.People with antisocial personality disorder cannot hold down a job because they will not follow rules, and often find themselves in legal trouble.Some autistic people have difficulty maintaining steady employment due to a tendency towards overstimulation and a reduced ability to control particular emotions, especially frustration., Symptoms of autism can be observed in individuals as young as 2 or 3, although may not be diagnosed until later, whereas schizoid PD does not usually present itself until early adulthood.Antisocial personality disorder is pervasive throughout a person’s life, although people with antisocial personality disorder can learn to fake typical behaviors in order to manipulate others.Symptoms of schizoid PD may be early signs of schizophrenia, and may get worse with time.

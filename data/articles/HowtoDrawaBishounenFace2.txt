 Join them by drawing two more lines and connect them with a small chin. Because bishounen tend to have somewhat feminine features, draw the face longer than usual. When drawing the chin, it should be at least somewhat thicker than a girl's chin (which is drawn as a point).
 Use a ruler or any straight edge surface to draw one line in the middle and one across the face. The line across the face will determine the placement for the eyes, while the line in the middle will be used for drawing the nose.



For the eyes, draw two parallelograms for the basic shape. This is an easier method because afterwards you just need to round off the edges.
When doing a straight-on face, the nose is drawn as a shadow rather than a line, thus giving it more depth.
Draw a slightly curved line for the mouth, and add a small shadow underneath. Unlike females, bishounens have longer mouths and are more detailed as well.
 Create thicker lines on the eyes and give him some eyelashes. When drawing the eyebrows, start drawing them thickly then slowly thin them at the ends. For the hair, either draw medium to long length hair, which is typical on many bishounen characters; for more details, have to look at a How to Draw Manga Hair.

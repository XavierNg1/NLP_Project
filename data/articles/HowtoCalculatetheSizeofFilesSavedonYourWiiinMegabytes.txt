, You must do this by looking at the bottom-left of the screen when you open 'data management' in Wii Settings. This tells you the amount of empty space. Go through each game save and channel save and add their amount of blocks to this total empty amount.



Use a calculator, divide 512 by the total amount of blocks. This amount is what one block is equal to in megabytes (remember, it must be 512 รท the total blocks, if you do total blocks รท 512 it will work out wrong).
Multiply this number by the amount of blocks the file is worth (for example, Internet Channel=250x(one block)).

 WD-40 is a powerful dissolvent that dissolves adhesives but is also a powerful chemical solution. Be sure not to get any on you, on fabrics, or even the glass surface.
 In order to avoid getting any on the glass, you might want to spray WD-40 on a clean cloth and wipe it on the sticker instead.


Be sure to protect your hands by wearing gloves.
 The sticker or decal should come right off with a little but of scrubbing. For particularly stubborn stickers, you may have to use a razor scraper or dull knife to remove it.

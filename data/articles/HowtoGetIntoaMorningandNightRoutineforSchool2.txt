, Make sure everything matches! A jean jacket, a cute top and a skirt is the way to go! Don't be afraid to accessorize! Try necklaces, bracelets, earrings, etc.
 Washing your face refreshes your morning and keeps you awake. It also helps with acne and pores.
 I'm not talking about a dozen sausage biscuits from McDonalds, something like a bowl of cereal, an orange, and a glass of milk is the way to go! Remember, breakfast is brain food!

, Yellow teeth and bad breath is not attractive!

, Buns, ponytails, braids are cute but you can always keep your hair down. Just make sure to brush it!

, Try to use colors that match the outfit your wearing. Beige, tan and brown are cute with most outfits.
 Make sure you didn't forget anything!

Use a measuring teaspoon to extract 1 tsp. (4.92 milliliters) of the cream of tartar powder from the jar.






Use a utensil, such as a butter knife, to level out the dosage by scraping the excess cream of tartar powder from the measuring spoon back into the jar.



Use a drinking glass that will hold at least 8 oz. (226.79 g) of liquid.






You may add a few drops of warm water to the cream of tartar powder before adding the orange juice to help the powder dissolve.



Pour 8 oz. (226.79 g) of orange juice into the glass over the powder and mix using a large spoon.
 Drinking the mixture before bedtime will help your body detoxify more efficiently since your metabolism is slower while you sleep.


Continue to drink the cream of tartar and orange juice mixture until you no longer crave nicotine. The treatment may take between 7 and 21 days depending on the amount of nicotine you smoked previously on a daily basis.

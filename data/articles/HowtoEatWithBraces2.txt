 Some foods are simply too tough to safely bite into with braces. As a general rule, you want to avoid biting into anything that could break or pop off a bracket or bend your wires.


Hard foods to be avoided include ice, hard candies, hard pretzels, pizza crust, croutons, nuts, and seeds to name a few.
You should also stay away from foods with a hard center, including ribs or chicken legs. Pull the meat off the bone instead.
 Sticky foods can stick to your brackets and be hard to clean off.Really sticky and chewy foods can even pull your orthodontic appliance away from your teeth. If this happens, you'll have to make an appointment with your orthodontist to have the appliance re-fixed; this can slow down treatment progress.


Stay away from taffy, caramel, Airheads, Skittles, jellybeans, Mentos, Jolly Ranchers, Starburst, licorice, and candy bars that have caramel. Peanut butter is fine.
 This means foods like sub sandwiches, pizza, hamburgers, celery, carrots, and most fruits that you can grab and go (like apples, peaches, pears, etc.).


Using your front teeth to bite into certain foods can damage the brackets. It can also cause food build-up in and around your braces, which may make you feel self-conscious.
 This is especially necessary if you have a palate expander, where food can easily get caught. Be especially careful with foods that get stringy when they melt, like mozzarella cheese., Foods high in sugar can cause plaque build-up and damage the enamel on your teeth.


The combination of sugar and plaque causes acid in the mouth, which can lead to swollen gums, decay, and discolored teeth. Keep in mind all of the time and efforts you have put into straightening your teeth before you reach for high-sugar foods that only damage them.

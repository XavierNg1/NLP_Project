 There are many ways to do this, one of which is to click on the Finder icon in the Dock, go into the Go sub menu in the menu bar, and click on "Connect to Server...". A box will appear, telling you to type in a server address. After you have typed one in, click "Connect" and mount one of the available drives.;
, If it's not already in your Dock (which is unrecommended, as this provides easy access to it), you can click on the Apple icon in the menu bar and go into "System Preferences...".
 It will be at the top of the list.
 This will bring you to list of items that run at login.
 If you did it right, you should see a green plus sign near your mouse cursor.

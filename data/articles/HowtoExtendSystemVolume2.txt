 Your data will not be deleted when you extend your system volume; however, you can prevent data loss due to unrelated issues your computer may experience while extending system volume.


Save your data to an external flash drive or disk, or use other third-party software to back up your data.
 The Disk Utility program will allow you to manage your system volume and partitions.


Open the Applications folder on your desktop, then click on "Utilities."
Open the Disk Utility program from the list of options provided in Utilities.



Select the disk or partition you want the system volume extended for within the left column of the Disk Utility screen.
Click on the "Partition" tab to review the volume information for the disk you have chosen.
Verify that "Current" is the option displayed in the field below "Volume Scheme."
Click on the bottom of the partition displayed below "Volume Scheme," and drag the partition downward to extend system volume.
Click on the "Apply" button to save your changes made to the system volume, then close the Disk Utility screen.

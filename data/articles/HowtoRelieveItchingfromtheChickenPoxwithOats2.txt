 Colloidal oats are a special type of oats. They are not edible like regular oats but are finely ground into a powder, and are used in products like shampoo, shaving gel, and moisturizing cream. Colloidal oats have high levels of starch that moisturize in addition to antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, meaning they work great as a soothing and protective skin agent.You should be able to find colloidal oats at most health or natural food stores.
 Alternately, you can make your own colloidal oats by using a food processor. Just take regular oats, not the instant kind. Grind them in a food processor or other grinding mill until they are a fine powder, eliminating any larger flakes. You make as much in advance as you'd like, from a small amount or an entire container.
 You will need about 1/3 cup of oat powder for each bath. Run the bath with lukewarm to warm water. Then, while the tub is filling, pour the oat powder into the running water stream. This will better disperse the oats into a colloidal solution, meaning that they will be suspended in the water and not sink to the bottom of the tub. Make double sure that they are properly dissolved by stirring the water to break up clumps.
 As with a sachet, place your child in the water once the oats have started to work their magic. Take care again because the colloidal oats may make the tub quite slippery., Allow your child to again soak from 15-20 minutes with the colloidal oats. Rather than using the sachet or sponge, scoop up the milky water with your hand and dribble it over your child. , Pat you child dry with a clean towel when done and avoid rubbing their skin, and you are done. You can bathe them once or twice a day like this while the condition persists, more if advised by a doctor.

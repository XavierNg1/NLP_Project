 There are a number of treatments available for different kinds of fungal rash. Some of them are available without a prescription (over the counter, or OTC), and may be cheaper options than prescription medication. Your doctor can advise you if these treatments are likely to help, or write a prescription if necessary.
 When fungal rash is already present and the area is still warm and moist, it can worsen the condition and aggravate your symptoms. Buy an antifungal powder that can be used daily. Powder prevents moisture from accumulating by absorbing it and keeping the surface of the skin dry at all times.


Baby powder can be used in shoes to keep your feet dry during the day, especially if you work in wet conditions, or your feet sweat a lot.
 Ketoconazole cream, an OTC drug available at any local pharmacy, is widely used to treat all forms of fungal rashes. This medication works by slowing the growth of the fungi that is infecting the skin. You can apply this cream once a day for 2 to 6 weeks until the rash totally goes away.Other common antifungal creams include:


Clotrimazole, which is sold under the brand names Canesten and Lotrimin. This is also an OTC medication that is used to treat a wide variety of fungal infections, especially yeast infections. It can be applied 2-3 times a day for 4 weeks.
Terbinafine, sold under the brand name Lamisil. This can also be bought without a prescription. It can be taken in cream or powder form for skin infections. There is a tablet form for fungal nail infections. Lamisil can be applied for 2 to 3 days.
 In some severe cases, fungal rash can become worse, even after trying various home and OTC remedies. If that is the case, your doctor can write a prescription. In addition to creams and powders, some of these prescriptions are taken as pills, or injected directly into the bloodstream intravenously.

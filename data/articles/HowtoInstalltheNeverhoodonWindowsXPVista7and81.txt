 The only legal way is to purchase, inherit or miscellaneously obtain a licit copy of the Neverhood game. The Neverhood can be found anywhere from garage sales to libraries to the Internet.

You can buy the Neverhood from Amazon, eBay and assorted commerce sites.



 


This article won't cover how to get the Neverhood without paying.



If you have an ISO file that contains the Neverhood, then right-click the ISO and select the option to open it using WinRAR or another preferred archive program. Extract all of the files to a new folder in C:\ called __neverhood.






Note that the folder MUST be called "__neverhood". UNDERSCORE UNDERSCORE NEVERHOOD rather than UNDERSCORE NEVERHOOD.


If you have some other kind of folder or archive that contains the contents of the Neverhood, simply extract/copy its internals (for a ZIP/tarball/whatever archive, don't copy the folder itself, copy the internals, like setup95.exe and the like) to a new folder in C:\ called Neverhood_Content.
 Now, you got two options: either use ScummVM to play the game (under a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS or Linux), or use the original game installer and executable, together with the Neverhood Restoration Project's installer.

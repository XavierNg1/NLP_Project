, Here's a few suggestions.


If you like a tank that takes the pain, try Bowser. If you want pure fight and carry the target, give Donkey Kong a shot.
All-arounder? Try Mario out. Mario's F.L.U.D.D. and Final Smash aren't too good, so you might want to have a few Brawl and unlock Luigi. Luigi not your style? How about Link? Toon Link?
How about the speeder striker? Give Fox a shot, or maybe you'd like to try out Sonic or Wolf O'Donnel. If you want the fast run, slow strike, power- go for Captain Falcon. If you aren't too crazy about Captain Falcon, you probably won't like the slower but stronger Ganondorf.
Want the power-no-range slomo? Ike is for you. Then again, you might like Solid Snake.
Transformations? They've got them! Samus is a well-rounded character that can transform into nimble Zero Suit Samus. Pokémon Trainer commands his Pokémon: Ivysaur, Charizard, and Squirtle, and can swap them out. Then there's Zelda and Shiek. Zelda has magic powers, and Shiek is mostly a ninja.
 You can check out Smash Bros. Dojo for some ideas.
 You may need to unlock parts to build a good Custom Stage. If you want a dead-on, no holding-me-back stage, go for a one-stock, one-on-one fight on the Final Destination. If you want a chase-me-down, try out the Hyrule Temple.
 Try killing CPUs of a certain level, then rise through the ranks. Keep going until you can defeat 3 Level 9 CPU's.
 This is a party game.
 Wi-Fi is a bit slow, so type in some Friend Codes and make things good.
 Most people prefer the Gamecube Controller, a select few like the Wii Remote, the Nunchuk and Remote is not too great, and the Classic Controller is a bit awkward.
 Maybe you want nothing but Motion Sensor Bombs set to high on the Hyrule Temple? Or maybe you want a 1-on-1, 1 stock match with no items on the Final Destination.

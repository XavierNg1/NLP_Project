 The back seat of your car is the safest location for your child in the event an accident occurs.;
, This can prevent your child from reaching or toying with the car locks and doors.
 The seat belts weaved through the car seat should sit snug, firm, and flat across your child's chest, and should not have the ability to move an inch in any direction.


Refer to the child car seat user manual to verify the proper seat belt path and to verify that you have properly secured the child car seat to the car itself.
If you feel that your infant is not completely secure in their car seat, place a rolled up towel or blanket around your child in your car seat for extra padding to ensure a secure fit.
Attend a local car seat workshop if you are still unsure about the proper car seat placement and seat belt configuration. These types of workshops are normally hosted by your local emergency services or fire department.

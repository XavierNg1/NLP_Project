 Try to do this in late November or early December. Rearrange things that overnight guests will need, such as coffee and cereal, in an easy to reach cupboard and create a baking cupboard.
 Buy flour, sugar and spices at warehouse stores so that you don't have to make late night runs to the supermarket. Buy some pre-made pie crusts and cookies to keep around in case you don't have time to do everything from scratch.
 Clear out your freezer, and then create a cooking to do list that allows you to make and freeze items every week. For example, bake 1 sweet, such as cookies or candy, and prepare 1 side dish in preparation.


Cover and label the dishes very well before you stack them on a freezer. For example, "Sweet Potatoes. Thaw and bake at 350 for 30 minutes."

, This is a great way to lower your budget and have fun. Allow people to bring desserts, side dishes or relish to family dinners as well; they understand your kitchen is very full.

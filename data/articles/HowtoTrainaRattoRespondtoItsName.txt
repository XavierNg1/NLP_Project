 If you decide your rat's cage is the best spot, that's fine. The best training areas are:


quiet, with no visual distractions;
already known by your rat (if you introduce a completely new space to your rat, it will be distracted by new smells, objects, and sounds);
enclosed and fairly clear (a kitchen table or (covered) pool table works well, as rats are instinctively afraid of heights, so your rat won't jump off a surface that is more than a few feet high).


Be sure that the space is large enough that you can move away from your rat, but small enough that the rat will still focus on you when you call it.





;
, Let it get adjusted to its surroundings. If you are using a cage, make sure your rat will not be able to smell nearby food or be distracted by its favorite toys.
 Holding a treat in front of you, and in a place where your rat can get to the treat, call your rat's name.


It may be necessary to move closer if your rat is not focused on you.
 Bit by bit, increase your distance until your rat has to come a fair distance to get to you and the treat.
 Start with a treat to no-treat ratio of about 5:1. Do your best not to create a pattern, such as every other time your rat comes you give it the treat. The rat will pick up on this and focus on the pattern, not learning the name sound.


Some rats adapt to not getting a treat easily. Others do not. If your rat becomes unwilling to respond to its name if it is not rewarded with food, try other rewards such as petting or scratching.
 Begin training in many different locations. This will help your rat learn that its new skill does not apply only to its training area. Another location can include its cage (if that is not its original training area).
 When your rat has learned to respond to its name, it will soon do it on command with no reward required at all.

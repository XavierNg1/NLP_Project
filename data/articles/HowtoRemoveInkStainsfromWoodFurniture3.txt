 You can find mineral spirits in any hardware store. It is also known as turpentine substitute. Dampen a cotton ball lightly with the mineral spirits and wipe it on a hidden area of the furniture. If the cotton comes away with some of the finish on it, do not proceed any further., Buff the stained area lightly with the cloth. Then, clean it off with a wet rag. If the stain is still there, go on to the next step.
 Rub the stained area using a piece of steel wool moistened with mineral spirits. Do this lightly and make sure you rub along the grain of the wood. Try to remove only as much finish as you have to. The less finish you remove, the easier it will be to refinish the furniture later.
 With a fresh cloth, wipe away the mineral spirits and the shavings created by the steel wool. The stain should be completely gone by now. Proceed with refinishing the piece if needed. If not, protect the finish by waxing or polishing it as soon as possible.

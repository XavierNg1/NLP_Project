 Place the can against the back top part of it. Position the lip of the can between the wheel and the cutting apparatus., This will set the opener into motion. It will begin to rotate the can. Hold it as it turns to keep it from tipping.
 This will cause the lid to raise up slightly. When the lid is completely cut, lift the top of the cutter head. Carefully disengage the can from the opener., Grab hold of it between your two fingers versus pressing the cut part against your fingers. Dispose of the lid. Enjoy the contents of the can.

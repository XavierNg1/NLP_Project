 Gallade is an evolution of Kirlia, which is an evolution of Ralts. Only male Kirlias can evolve into a Gallade. Since finding a Kirlia is difficult, you will have more luck getting your hands on a Ralts. Note: if you can obtain a male Kirlia through trading or in the wild, you can skip to Step 3.


Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald – Ralts can be captured on Route 102 connecting Oldale Town and Petalburg City. Ralts is rare, so you may have to spend some time finding one.
Pokémon Diamond and Pearl – Ralts can be captured on Routes 203 and 204. You have to use your Poké Radar to encounter it. You also have a very small chance of finding a Kirlia, which will save you some time.
Pokémon Platinum – Ralts can be found on Routes 208, 209, and 212. Kirlia can also be found on Route 212 and Route 209 with the Poké Radar.
Pokémon Black and White – Ralts can be found in the White Forest in Pokémon White, but cannot be found by Pokémon Black players. Pokémon Black players will need to trade with another game to obtain Ralts.
Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 – Ralts can only be obtained by going through the trading game with Curtis or Yancy in Nimbasa City. Ralts will be the third Pokémon you receive, but may be either female or male.
Pokémon X and Y – Ralts can be found in Route 4 in both the Yellow and Red flowers. It is a rare Pokémon, so this may take a little while.;
, Ralts needs to reach level 20 in order to evolve into Kirlia. You can either fight battles to gain this experience or use Rare Candies to increase Ralts’ level.


The “Exp. Share” item will help Ralts evolve quicker.
 Dawn Stones can be found in a variety of locations in all of the different games, including Dust Clouds in Black and White and Black 2 and White 2, and from Secret Super Training in X and Y.Do not let your Kirlia reach level 30 before evolving. At level 30, Kirlia will automatically evolve into Gardevoir, and you will lose your chance to obtain Gallade with that Pokémon.

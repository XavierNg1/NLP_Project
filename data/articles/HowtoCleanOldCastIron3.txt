 Vinegar is acidic and will destroy your cast iron if it's exposed to it for too long. This method should only be used for very rusted cast iron items. Combine equal parts of warm water with white vinegar in a tub or sink that's big enough to fit the cast iron item you are cleaning., Submerging your cast iron in the vinegar and water solution should soften up some of the rust and will allow you to remove it. Do not let your cast iron sit in the vinegar solution or you could damage the cast iron.If your entire cast iron item isn't submerged, it will create an uneven color.
 Wipe the rust with a cloth or a sponge. If the rust comes off, then you can stop soaking your cast iron. If the rust is still embedded in the cast iron, continue to soak the cast iron and check back frequently until the rust starts to rub off. Finish scrubbing the cast iron until it's clean and there is no more rust., Once all the rust has been removed and the cast iron is clean, run it under cold water to rinse off any remaining debris or solution. Use a dry cloth to completely dry down the cast iron.

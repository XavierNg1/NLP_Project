 Where would your character live or act? Does your villain prefer a dark evil lair full of technological doodads, or do they want to live in a shadowed, dark, cave that is full of shadows? Or do you want to go against conventions and show them living happily with a family or give them a sense of humour that appeals to the viewer.
 Use props to externalize how the character is feeling.
 If it's a softer, kinder character who is much less concerned about how he or she looks than other aspects of life, use very little makeup in flesh-colored or very light tones. If your character is extremely outgoing and likes to stand out in the crowd, try bolder colors, especially on the lips our around the eyes. If you are going for a completely costume- y look, such as designing an alien or superhuman, your stylist should be extremely dramatic so that the effects will pick up well during filming.
 This technique is called pathetic fallacy where you use the weather to externalize how a character is feeling. For example rain is used to connote sorrow, sunshine happiness and a storm to suggest anger or rage.

 There's plenty to be done. There are sets of information from The Democrats and/or from The Republicans.
Have a basic instruction and training for each volunteer about what's legal, and what works, and especially stressing how important the volunteers are. Talk about: "We can't do this without you, but with each and everyone of you helping -- we can do it."


Communicate effectively using an Organization consisting of all of your precinct canvassers/communicators, "Campaign Precinct Captains".



Have an overall Organization Volunteer Coordinator to see that volunteers receive basic training or have an experienced Area Coordinator train the others, and then the Area Coordinators recruit Campaign Precinct Captains to do that office and to train the Captains.

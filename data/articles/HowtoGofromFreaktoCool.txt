 If you don't, learn that everyone is different and that you can be proud of who you are. If you still can't seem to find friends, a counselor may be able to help. Friends help build self-esteem and even if your friends are freaks, they can help you a lot.;
,, Do not take it personally when people are mean. If they are really mean, who cares if you impress them, they don't care anyway. Try to ignore them, but tell a trusted adult if they harass you.
 If you don't have much money, you can go to resale shops like Plato's Closet and Goodwill or cheaper stores for your clothes. If you can, go to the mall.
,,,,,, Don't let other people make you sad. Just think you don't need to make fun of other people to make yourself feel better. Don't let others rule your life. Oh and one more thing make sure that you are nice to be around. Because if people enjoy being around you you will et more friends. Find people who like the same stuff as you. Good Luck!!!!

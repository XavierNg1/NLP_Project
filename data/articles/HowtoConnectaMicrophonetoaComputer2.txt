 Higher grade music microphones, condenser mics, and other professional gear will generally require an adapter or a converter cable before you plug them in. These range in price, and will vary depending on the type of microphone you're trying to input into the computer.


If you see a triangle of prongs on the end of the end of the microphone, that's an XLR mic, and you'll need to get either a cable which converts the XLR jack into the eighth-inch port, a converter box which will convert it into USB, or a mixer.
If the jack is a quarter-inch, the size of a guitar cable, you'll need to purchase an adapter cable that will convert into either USB or (more usually) eighth-inch size, and plug it into the mic port or the headphone port. These cables are usually quite cheap, no more than a few dollars.
 Both of these types of mics will need to be connected to some kind of adapter before you plug them into the computer. Because these microphones are typically higher quality, it's best to invest in good adaption equipment to keep the signal as strong as possible.


XLR mics can be adapted relatively cheaply with cables or a USB converter box, but some users find that this can be "crackly," losing some of the presence of good microphones. For the best sound quality, invest in a mixing board with a USB output.
Quarter-inch to eighth-inch converter cables are widely available and pretty cheap to buy. You can find them at any electronics store or online electronics retailer.
 The easiest and quickest way to test your levels and check your settings is to go to your input sound options and make sure that the device you just plugged in is visible, and that it is selected for use. Open a recording program and attempt to use the microphone and set the levels.


On Windows, you can use the Sound Recorder, on a Mac, Quicktime or GarageBand should do fine.

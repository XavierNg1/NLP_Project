 It could be in an ongoing note on your phone or in a dedicated notebook.


Throughout the year, jot down things you’d like to get to but don’t have time for right away.
When you have a holiday, consult your list for things to do.
 Though it may seem counterintuitive, creating a schedule for your holiday can help you manage your time so that you get to relax and get a few things done.


This schedule could be as simple as a to-do list on a post-it note, or you could write it in your planner or calendar.



Your project might be anything from painting a dresser to weeding your garden to organizing a messy closet.
Keep it fun. While you work on your project, keep snacks around and listen to great music or watch a favorite TV show.
Do some chores. Even if you don’t want to tackle a big project, doing chores like washing the sheets on your bed or cleaning your bathtub can help your space feel fresh.
 Setting aside long periods of time to read can help you get around to finishing that book you’ve been wanting to read and feel accomplished.Reading can also help you unplug from technology. It’s still a relaxing activity, but you won’t feel like a zombie in front of your computer or television.
 Exercise has many long-term benefits, and it can release endorphins and promote relaxation afterwards.Set a aside thirty means or an hour to do a cardio workout. Holidays are a great time to exercise because you won’t be rushed or feel like you need to be somewhere else. You’ll feel better after you sweat and can spend the rest of your time off relaxing.

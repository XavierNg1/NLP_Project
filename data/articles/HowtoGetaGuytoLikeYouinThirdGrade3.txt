 Although giving your crush the cold shoulder (or playing hard to get) can work out sometimes, it can often backfire and can make your crush think you’re mean.
 Recess and lunch are perfect for spending time with him. Sit next to him during lunchtime, or invite him to play a game with you during recess.


If you are feeling extra brave, ask your crush if he would like to spend time with you outside of school. This will give you a better chance of talking with him one-on-one.
 Ask your crush what their favorite books, movies, or activities are.


If you and your crush share similar interests, talking about the things you both like can be a great way to bond and connect.
If you and your crush don’t have many common interests, that’s ok. Try asking him (nicely) why he likes the things he does -- for example, if you don’t particularly care for baseball but your crush is a baseball fanatic, ask him what things he likes best about the sport.
 Don’t pretend to like certain things just because your crush likes them.


While it can be nice to show some curiosity in your crush’s interests, remember that you don’t need to have everything in common in order for him to like you.
Faking interests or trying to change your personality can leave you feeling uncomfortable or unhappy, and if you appear uncomfortable or unhappy it might make your crush feel uncomfortable too (which might make him less likely to return your affections).

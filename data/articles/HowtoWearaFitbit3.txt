 Hook your device up to its charger overnight or anytime you’re not using it to assess your activity levels. A full battery will guarantee access to all your charts and features and let the device sync with other apps, like Mobile Run or Strava.Disabling unnecessary features (such as All-Day Sync, which enables the Fitbit to pass information back and forth with your smartphone) can greatly improve your device’s battery life.Watch your battery level closely to make sure your Fitbit doesn’t die on you when during exercise.
 Most bands can simply be wiped down with a little rubbing alcohol or a mild water-based cleaning solution. For heavier buildup due to sweat, sunscreen and other substances, try scrubbing the inside of the band lightly with a soft-bristled toothbrush.Avoid using soaps, as these can leave behind residues that can cause skin irritation.Don’t submerge your Fitbit or clean it with extremely hot or cold water.
 Fitbit bands come in a wide range of colors and materials, including nylon, metal, stretchy synthetic elastomer and all-natural leather. Try out various bands to find the one that’s most comfortable for you and allows for maximum movement and versatility. You could have a different band for every day of the week!


A band's performance depends largely on what it's made from. Elastomer, for example, will provide the greatest amount of flexibility and comfort, while rugged materials like leather and nylon offer exceptional durability.
Bands in neutral colors will wear just as well with a dress shirt and slacks as shorts and a tank top.

 When people order train tickets, they tend to purchase a ticket on a straight shot to wherever they’re going. But strangely, buying tickets for every step along the journey could save you money. Look for opportunities to engage in so-called “ticket-splitting” where possible.For instance, suppose you’re taking a train from Washington, D.C. to New York City. The train will also pass through Baltimore and Philadelphia. If you buy three tickets – one from D.C. to Baltimore, another from Baltimore to Philadelphia, and a third from Philly to New York – you could save money when comparing the cost to buying a single ticket for a trip from D.C. to New York.
Check the prices on the split tickets to ensure that they total less than what you’d pay for the single ticket.;
, Popular routes are direct and travel quickly to their destination. But they are also the most expensive tickets. Look for less popular routes which are less direct. It might take you longer to arrive at your destination, but you might save on ticket fare., Some railway ticket retailers offer customers the opportunity to get alerts sent to their phone or email. Trainline, for instance, will ping your email when tickets go on sale to a location you’ve confirmed an interest in. Other train ticket retailers offer similar alert systems. Contact the rail line of your choice to find out how you can get alerted when tickets for destinations you’re interested in are on discount.

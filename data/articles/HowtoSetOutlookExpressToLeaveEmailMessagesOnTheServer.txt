Either way, a Properties box will open, and you'll find the Advanced tab farthest to the right. Click that.
 You'll find the Delivery section near the bottom of the Advanced tab. Simply check the box placed next to the option reading "Leave a copy of messages on server."

, Because copies stored on your server can slow mail connections and eat up allotted disk space, you also may wish to check the box next to "Remove from server after X days" while also selecting the number of days you keep the copies.


You can also (or alternatively) check the box below that, allowing copies to be removed from the served when the original emails are permanently deleted from Deleted Items.

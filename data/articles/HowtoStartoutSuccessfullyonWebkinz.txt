 If this is your first furry friend, go to www.webkinz.com and click "New Member". Ms. Birdy will tell you what to do, follow her directions extra-carefully!;
, Again, follow Ms. Birdy's directions.
 Some people think that this is very unrealistic, but it is useful to have 10,000 Kinzcash to start out a Webkinz, to furnish its room appropriately. Instead of buying each Webkinz a separate stove, bathtub, etc. you can buy a room for the kitchen, and one for the bathroom, etc.; your house will be easier to maintain that way. The first things you should get are definitely a bed, and a bathtub. As soon as you think you can spare the money, get a yard and grow food! You can find seed packets in the Gardening section of the W-shop.
 Go to the Wheel of WOW, and the Wishing Well in the arcade, and click "I love my Webkinz" in the My Pets section. Your wallet will thank you! Quizzy's and the Employment Office are great places, too!

, Don't splurge on an Oak Paneled Pool while your Webkinz is starving. Attend to its needs, and buy food instead!

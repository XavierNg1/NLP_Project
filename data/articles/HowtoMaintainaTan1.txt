 Moisturizing your skin will keep your tan looking smooth and natural. Too much sun can dry out your skin, leaving a tan with a cracked or burnt appearance. Use moisturizer each day to maintain a smooth, attractive tan.Apply any regular moisturizer you use after showering or each time your skin feels dry.
In addition to your regular moisturizer, go for after-sun creams like aloe vera. Applying such creams after being out in the sun can help your skin repair, leaving you looking tanned rather than burnt.;
, If waxing is your chosen hair removal method, go a different route. Waxing can strip off the top layer of your skin, removing your tan. Instead of waxing, opt for shaving as you try to maintain your tan.As shaving can dry out your skin, always moisturize afterwards. You should also use a moisturizing shaving cream.
 A tan can go from bronzed to burnt without proper protection from the sun. Each time you go out in the sun, apply sunscreen to any exposed body parts. Use a sunscreen with a high SPF. The higher the SPF, the better protected your skin will be from the sun.It can also help to avoid sun exposure by wearing longer sleeves and things like hats and visors.
 When taking your morning shower, avoid the hot water. Hot water can strip oils from your body, lessening your tan. When showering, opt for cooler water to keep your tan longer.Also, use moisturizing body washes in the shower to avoid stripping your skin of oils needed to maintain a tan.

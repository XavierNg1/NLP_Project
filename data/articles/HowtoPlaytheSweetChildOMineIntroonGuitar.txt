 Since you're only learning the intro, you don't have to listen to the whole song. Just listen to the first part. Take into account how fast it's played, how long it lasts and how most of it's just repeated patterns. Just spending five minutes noting these things will help you loads when you're trying to play the song.;
,,,,,,,,,, That whole section is the first part of the riff. Practice it at 80bpm until you can play it perfectly. Add 10bpm until you reach around 150bpm. For the rest of the intro, it's pretty much all the same so make sure you can play it well. If you need time, spend an hour practicing, then come back to this article and learn the rest.
,,,, For the last little riff, you need your index finger on the twelfth fret of the high E string, your middle finger on the fourteenth fret of the G string and your ring finger on the fifteenth fret of the B string.
 Keep this hand position; just pick the high E string, the G string, the B string, back to the G string, then the high E string again then finish on the G string.
 Remember not to move any other fingers.
 With the same hand position, hit just the high E string and then the G string.
 You should still have all four fingers on the fretboard.
 Keeping this position, hit the high E string, then the G string and then remove your pinky. Pick the high E string, then the G string and then remove your ring finger. Pick the high E string, then the G string, then finish by swinging your ring finger around to land on the fifteenth fret of the B string. Pick that string and let the note ring out.

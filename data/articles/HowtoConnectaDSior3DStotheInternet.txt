Some Internet access points have security features enabled which render them inaccessible from your DS unless you use Advanced Setup. These access points will have a grey padlock next to their names. To connect to one of these access points, tap Advanced setup and choose a connection file (4, 5 or 6).
 Your DS will search for nearby Internet access points.
 Tap the name of the access point you want to connect to.

If your access point is not shown, move closer to it and try again.
, Once the connection test completes successfully, you will now be able to connect your DS to the Internet.

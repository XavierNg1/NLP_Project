 Look for the game app on your device. Its name is Spider-Man with the classic Spider-Man on the logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 Tap the blue “Recruit” button on the lower left corner of the page. This will bring you to the recruitment page where you can open different portals for a chance to get a new Spider-Man.


The basic portals here are Premium and Standard. Sometimes there are Event portals as well, which are time-limited portals related to existing Events under the Event mode.
 In the Premium box, tap the green button with the 25 ISO-8. Each new Premium Spider-Man you bring through this portal will cost 25 ISO-8. The Spider-Man character you bring in is given in random, so you don’t really know what you’ll get.


All Premium-issue Spider-men’s ranks range from 5–6 stars. You are guaranteed a Rare Spider-Man with this portal.
You can do the same thing for an Event portal, which also costs 25 ISO-8.
 After tapping the green button, a portal will open and a Rare (5 stars) or an Epic (6 stars) Spider-Man will come out. The Spider-Man’s costume name and stars will be displayed, with its level and abilities.


To know more about this Spider-Man, tap the question mark icon beside the character. This new Spider-Man will be added to your team roster.
This will only work if you have an available and empty character slot in your team roster. See Method 4 if you’re running out of character slots.

 Add 2 cored and diced red apples, 2 cored and diced pears, 4 clementines that have been peeled and separated into sections, 3 kiwis that have been peeled, sliced into thin rounds, and quartered, ½ cup (60 g) of dried cranberries, and 1 cup (174 g) of pomegranate seeds to a large bowl. Toss the ingredients well with a wooden spoon or salad tongs to mix the salad.Red delicious, Cortland, and Macintosh are good red apple options.
 Add 2 tablespoons (40 g) of maple syrup and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of fresh lime juice to a small bowl. Use a whisk to blend the two together.You can substitute lemon juice for the lime if you prefer.
 Once you’ve mixed the dressing, add it to the bowl with the fruit. Use the wooden spoon or salad tongs to carefully toss the salad so all of the fruit is well coated with the dressing., After you’ve tossed the salad with the dressing, spoon it into individual bowls. Serve the salad at room temperature right away for the best flavor.Store any leftover salad in the refrigerator but eat within 1 to 2 days.

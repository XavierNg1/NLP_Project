 Begin by cleaning off the crumbs and other debris that may have accumulated on the oven glass. You can use a moistened cloth to loosen and pick up the crumbs. Or, you can use a vacuum attachment., Pour a half or full cup of baking soda into a bowl. Add in only enough water to create a paste that resembles the consistency of shaving cream. Spread the paste over the oven glass. Allow it to sit for 15 minutes., Use a dampened rag or microfiber cloth. Scrub the glass until it becomes clean. You may have to scrub firmly for tough grime and debris., Rinse the glass off with water. You can use a wet cloth to do this. Make sure all of the baking soda has been washed off. Use a dry cloth to dry the glass., If any tough spots are left, you can remove them with a razor. Gently scrape the spot with the razor. Make sure not to exert too much pressure, or you may scratch the glass. Once all of the remaining spots have been removed, wipe off or vacuum up the debris.

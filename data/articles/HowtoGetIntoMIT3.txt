 You are about to join a community dedicated to applying science and technology to solutions that will improve the world. Make it clear that you are ready and eager to be a part of that.


Have you rewired the electricity in your bedroom? Made your own locks on your doors? Don't be hesitant to include these things in your interview. You will stand out in your creativity and uniqueness.
MIT is, ultimately, a network. Let them know how you work on a team and how you make that team better.
MIT wants something unusual, even weird, even freakish. If you have, let's say, a fascination with a certain fish, you should develop that interest. Learn about that fish. Own that fish. Do something to help that fish. You want to have something that everyone else doesn't. Stand out.
 Things that happen in an a cappella group or at bible camp are relevant to things that happen in the classroom and science lab. Leave neither hide nor hair unturned.


MIT is looking for incredibly dynamic students. Making it clear that you're involved in every aspect of your community--as a volunteer, student, artist, athlete, employee, caregiver, initiator--to show just how valuable you are. Most of their applicants will be great at 1 or 2 things; very few will be great at many.
 There are tons of good schools out there--why do you want to go to MIT? Do your research and prove you belong.


Log onto their website and take a look at their stats. Do you like the size of their student body? The set up of their campus? Their location? Their mission statement? Familiarize yourself (like you would a friend) to figure out if you are truly compatible.
Take a tour. Many universities have high freshman dropout rates because they're just not at the right place at the right time. Be certain this is what you want and fully commit.
Don't worry about financial aid. MIT is one of the few institutions in America that is need-blind. That is, students who can pay full tuition have no advantage over those who cannot.

Some games can be played with "Multiple Lives". This means a player can be shot 1, 2, 3, or however many times you set up.

Go back to their starting point and can then proceed in re-entering the game if you are shot.
If a player is shot multiple times within a couple seconds of each other it still only counts as one life lost.
The player must go back to the starting point before another life can be lost. This makes games last longer and can also be interesting when you have to borrow paintballs from other players on your team because you run out.

 It's very important to make sure that you BOTH know you guys are dating, that clears up any awkwardness between you two.;
, Your friends and his friends should know what you two are doing. Create some good gossip to go around the school that lets people know that you guys are a couple. That way no other girls try to take your man.
 That way when you're with him and his friends come up, you won't feel left out or awkward.
 Go to his locker between classes, sit with him at lunch, partner with him in the classes you have together. This will show him you care, and it will make your relationship more fun.
 Take him and a group of friends to the mall, the park, or even the back of the school on the weekends (if allowed).
 If you find out something about him, or learn something that is a little odd, don't make him feel insecure. He will do the same for you when he gets to know you a little better.
 There will probably be a lot of drama during your relationship, just remember, he is usually right. Sometime, you shouldn't trust what people say, even your friends sometimes. Just ask him what the truth is, and usually it is no big deal.
 See what clubs he does, what sports he likes, and his favorite type of music. If you have something in common, great! If not, try some of those things and you might actually like them.
 Hug him goodbye, wave in the hall, or let him put his arm around you.

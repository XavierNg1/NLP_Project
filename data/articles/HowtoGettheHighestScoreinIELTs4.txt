 If you are not able to clearly speak, the best thing is to listen to day-to-day English conversations .you may be able listen to radio, TV or may be to read dialogues written in English.
 For example, if the examiner asks you to talk about food in your country, just don't start to talk about the diet your people take. But you can talk about cuisine when talking about food.
 Ask the friend to be the examiner and you be the candidate, keep lot of practice sessions and speak on different topics, keeping to what is asked.
 Use lots of different words, and remember to use expressions.
 Just keeping a little gap between your words is ok, but practice to be fluent.

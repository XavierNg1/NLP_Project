 You should water them as soon as the top of the soil becomes dry during the spring, summer and early fall. These are tropical plants and cold, fresh tap water can stress them.


Use water that has been “aged” or left in an open container for at least 24 hours to let the chlorine dissipate.
 Empty the saucer beneath the container after it drains through or set the croton in a tub or large sink while watering and return it to its place after the water stops draining.


Water left in the saucer could be soaked back up into the potting soil, keeping the croton’s roots too wet and depriving them of oxygen. Croton plant roots require some oxygen exposure to keep them healthy.
 In late fall and winter, wait until the top 1 to 2 inches of soil becomes dry before watering. This will encourage the croton to slow down and rest for a few months before resuming vigorous growth in the spring.
 A croton plant’s leaves will turn yellow and drop if it is being watered too little and if it is being watered too much.


If this happens at any time during the year, adjust the watering frequency up or down, depending on the season and how much the soil has been allowed to dry before watering.

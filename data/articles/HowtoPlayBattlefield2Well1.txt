 Take cover behind things, jump off buildings to get away from an enemy who has climbed up, climb up buildings so you will have the jump on approaching enemies. Know the maps well so you won't get lost.
 Speed is a big part of this game so always be moving in the direction of your goal. Avoid walking straight, be sure to strafe some and move around. If someone is trying to snipe you this makes it really, really hard to get a head shot.
 But be sure not to stay too long once they have spotted you.
 When traveling around the maps, don't use up all your sprint; try to keep some in reserve for when you are in combat.
 You can reload your weapon while you are moving, and, if you start reloading first, then you can sprint and reload at the same time.

 Why exactly do you want the first chair spot? Attention? Self-accomplishment? This will help your devotion and motivation.;
, The history. Study the parts of it, study how everything works. Study, study, study.

 Like the saying goes, "Practice makes perfect." For the flute, start practicing long tones, vibrato, and dynamics. Those are three key things flute players have trouble with, and if you perfect these, your band director will definitely notice.
 Okay, there might be some mixed thoughts about this, but show off a little. This will get you noticed by your band director and bandmates- just don't overdo it. Really emphasize those accents. If you've practiced well enough, be the only one in class to get that new music right the following day of getting it. Be the only one playing when sight-reading.
 Not during rehearsal, but before it starts and maybe during water breaks. Talk to your peers-tell them about how you thought the last measure was epic. Ask your band director questions if need be. Throw some compliments around. You need to get noticed if you ever want to be considered (or even rooted for) for first chair.
 Always give it your best shot. Not only will this be better on you, but everyone will notice and admire you for it. Relax, and ask to try for the first chair spot. Or perform a piece your director gave to you and the rest of the section.

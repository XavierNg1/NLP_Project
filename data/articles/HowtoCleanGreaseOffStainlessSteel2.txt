 Empty the sink or get a clean bowl. Fill it with hot water, then add a squirt of a liquid detergent. Mix in the detergent to create soapy water.Mild detergents are those such as Palmolive and Dawn that don’t have abrasive qualities.
 A nylon brush for dish cleaning is soft enough to avoid scratching the steel. Dip it into the soapy water.


If you are worried about the brush scratching the steel, you can try to apply the cleaner using a soft cloth, sponge, or non-scratch scouring pad such as a Scotch-Brite., Again, remember to take a close look at the surface of your stainless steel. If you can see the grain forming lines, scrub along those lines. This keeps the brush from scratching the steel., Place the appliance under warm running water if possible or use a soft cloth. The scrub brush will dislodge the grease, and the water will rinse away the grease and soap. Use the cloth to wipe along the grain and remove the soap., Use a clean, soft cloth and move it along the grain. Make sure you remove all the moisture so that the stainless steel doesn’t get a water stain.

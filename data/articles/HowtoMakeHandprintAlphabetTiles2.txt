 Although you know you will include your child’s handprint, what will you create from the handprint? Animals, people, transportation? The possibilities are endless.


Sketch out each letter and how you will create it with the child’s handprint. Make a plan for how each tile will appear. Use a pencil and sketch out each design and add your child’s “handprint” by just sketching it at first so you can see how it will appear.
 You could do all white tiles with bright colored paint or you could use colored tiles, black tiles and reverse white or bright colored paint. Consider how you plan to display the tiles when choosing your color scheme into consideration.


Take placement into consideration. If you are planning to display the tiles in a bathroom or main area of the home you will want to plan accordingly in order the match the overall tone of the room.
Find the right suite of paints. Select paint that is not only compatible on tile but matches the color of tile you selected and the room colors.

 This puts you in a different frame of mind than when you were busy writing your work and makes you less likely to gloss over errors. You may need as little as a few minutes away from the piece, to let it sit overnight, or longer, depending on what you're writing and your schedule., The slower you read through a piece, the more likely you are to spot grammatical and other mistakes. The faster you read, the more you're likely to miss.
 By reading backwards, you're more likely to see mistakes than if you read from start to finish.
 Reading aloud forces to read words individually and therefore slowly, making it more likely you'll catch grammatical and other errors., Although many word processing programs include editing tools, such as Word's Track Changes feature, many writers find it easier to read printed text instead of on-screen text.


If you do print out a draft to edit, consider printing the text double-spaced. This will allow you more room to make corrections and to place them above the incorrect text.

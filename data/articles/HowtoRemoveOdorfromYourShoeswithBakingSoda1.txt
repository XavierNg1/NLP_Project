 You need to use enough baking soda to cover the entire insole of the shoe. If you have big shoes, you may need to use more than 1 tablespoon of baking soda.
 Tilt the shoe forward and back to help spread the baking soda across the insole. You can also jiggle the shoe from side-to-side as well. Be careful not to spill any baking soda—you want there to be lumps and clumps of it.
 Extra-stinky shoes may require up to 24 hours. During this time, the baking soda will soak up any bad odors. It may also kill any odor-causing bacteria., Once the time is up, turn the shoes upside-down over a trashcan or a sink. Tap and shake the shoes to get the baking soda out. Don't worry if there is some baking soda dust left inside the shoe—it won't hurt you. If it really bothers you, however, you can always vacuum it up., If your shoes tend to get smelly often, you can repeat this once a week.Avoid using this too often on leather shoes, however, as the baking soda can cause the leather to become dry or brittle over time.If you have leather shoes that tend to get sticky, try leaving them in a well-ventilated area so that they can air out. A dryer sheet stuffed inside the shoe can help further freshen it up.

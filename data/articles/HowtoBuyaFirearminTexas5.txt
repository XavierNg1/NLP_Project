 In Texas, you need a Concealed Handgun License (CHL) or License to Carry (LTC) if you wish to carry a concealed handgun. (The CHL and LTC are just two different names for the same license.) You may carry a “long gun” (hunting rifle, for example) without a license, but you must have the license for a handgun in a holster., In order to be eligible for a License to Carry in Texas, you must meet the following minimum requirements. These items are verified as part of the application. You must respond truthfully and under oath.

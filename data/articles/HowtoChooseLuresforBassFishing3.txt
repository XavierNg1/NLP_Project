 Thanks to their unique blade shape, they can dive, retrieve quickly, and even weave through thick cover.Choose spinnerbaits in standard or weedless. A weedless spinnerbait is a good option if you are fishing in a lot of cover, but are also harder to set the hook on. Add a cheater hook to catch short striking fish.
 There are 3 major blade types: leaf, Colorado, and Indiana. Each blade type is effective for different conditions.


The leaf blade is most effective when fishing through grass and in clear water when you want a fast retrieval. It is a long slender blade with rounded points on either end to allow a faster spin and less water resistance.Deploy the Colorado blade when fishing at night or in muddy and murky water. The rounded shape allows it to spin slower giving the bass more opportunity to bite.Utilize the Indiana blade as a compromise to the slower Colorado blade and faster leaf blade.
 Check for debris or water clarity to ensure that you’re using the most effective blades.


The larger the blade means that it is easier to maneuver around stumps, rocks, and other debris, while narrow blades move quickly through sparse grass.Spinner baits work best when it’s windy and cloudy because they are meant to cause a reaction from the bass. Use faster spinner baits in clearer water and slower ones in muddier water., Choose lighter spinnerbaits for shallow water while heavier lures should be used for deeper depths. The weight will range from ⅛ ounce to 2 ounces.Remember that the slower you reel, the deeper your lure will swim while reeling fast keeps your lure shallow.Blade size also affects how deep your lure will go but you can also add a trailer to your hook for buoyancy and movement., While there are an abundance of colors to choose from, it’s best to keep it simple. Choose clear shad, bright chartreuse with white and black for night fishing or fishing in muddy water.Some anglers are successful with painted blades to give some extra flash.

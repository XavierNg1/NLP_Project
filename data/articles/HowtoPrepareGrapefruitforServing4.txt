 Using a large sharp knife, cut the grapefruit through its “equator”. This will give you two equal grapefruit halves., Stand one grapefruit half up on a cutting board so that the “pole” of the grapefruit and the open part of the grapefruit are horizontal to the cutting board. Using the sharp knife, cut ¼ inch slices of grapefruit. Do this for both halves of the grapefruit.Be very careful that your fingers don’t get in the way of the knife.
 Take the sharp knife and cut each circular grapefruit slice into a half-moon shaped slice. You can stop here, or if you want smaller wedges, cut the half-moon shaped slices in half to create triangular slices.
 Take the knife and cut a small slit into the fruit of each grapefruit wedge. Take the wedges and put them on the rims of glasses or cups; the slit will help the grapefruit stay put on the rim.If you are not preparing any beverages, you can also simply put grapefruit cut in this way on a plate to eat.

 There are several important considerations here:


Do you want to hold it during school term or during the vacation time? During school term limits the options to weekend nights, while during school vacation, some of the friends might be away.
Are there any big events on that might stop guests from coming? For example, big sports meet-ups, local drama plays being staged, try-outs for teams, etc.
Are there known issues about some friends being tied up doing something on any particular dates? Especially if they're BFFs, don't plan the party if they're not going to be able to make it.
Is it near or around exam time? If so, do not hold the party as it will distract the girls and many of them probably won't be allowed to come anyway.
Is the weather going to be appropriate for the sleepover? Although the girls sleep indoors, this could impact outdoor activities or outings to things.
If you're a parent planning the party, ask your daughter if she knows of anything that might prevent guests from being available on a specific date. If not, and you've considered the above possibilities, you're good to go.;
, A late afternoon start is fairly standard, such as around 4pm, 5pm, etc. This allows time for the girls to settle in or for you take them somewhere, such as to see a movie, to go bowling or to have a pizza meal out. Obviously, the time will depend on whether or not you've planned an external activity.


Be sure to seek the permission of parents if taking the girls out of your home. They may prefer to help with transportation arrangements.
 It's nice to let the parents have a little sleep in or take their time to come and collect their daughter the next morning and the girls usually love staying in one another's company a little longer. A 10am, 11am or noon pick-up time usually works best. It does mean that you have to include breakfast.

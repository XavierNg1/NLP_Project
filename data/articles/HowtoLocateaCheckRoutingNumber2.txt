 Remember, the routing number isn't secure, so it's publicly available. You can often find it online.


Visit your bank's website and look for a link that will provide information about routing numbers. Often, banks have routing number information published online.
Google your bank's name plus the words "routing number." If you can't find it by looking directly at your bank's website, try Google. You might be surprised at how often you can find something with Google that you can't find easily at a company site.
 One of the most reliable ways to get an accurate routing number is to talk to someone who's actually experienced in providing that information.
 If you'd like to work with someone locally, instead of at a call center, you should visit your bank and talk to someone who can provide you with your routing number.

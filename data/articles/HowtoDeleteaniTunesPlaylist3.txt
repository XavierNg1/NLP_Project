 You can playlists from your iPod without going through the hassle of connecting the device to your computer and manipulating it through iTunes. The Music app is represented by a musical note in an orange box.
 Along the bottom of the screen are categories such as Radio, Artists, Songs, More, and Playlists. Tap Playlists to view the lists stored on your iPod.
 Deleting a playlist from your iPod does not remove it from iTunes, so you can always re-sync the playlist to your iPod if you want to listen to that particular mix of songs later.

 Most doctors will calculate how many weeks you're pregnant from your last monthly period. To begin your calculations, figure out when you last had your period. You'll start with the first day of your last period.This calculation only works if you are fairly regular, meaning your period comes mostly on a set schedule, such as every 29 days.
 Once you've figured out your first day, you can count the weeks to figure out how far along you are. When you're counting weeks, you don't start with week one. Rather, once you've completed week one, you are considered to be one week pregnant. Therefore, if you're in your fourteenth week but haven't completed it yet, you're only thirteen weeks pregnant., Your due date will be forty weeks into your pregnancy. Count forty weeks from the last day of your period to figure out your due date. Keep in mind, though, that due dates are not an exact science. Your baby will come when it wants to!

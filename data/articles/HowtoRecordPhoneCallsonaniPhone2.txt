 If you have other hardware available to use, such as an iPad or a computer with a microphone, they can be used to make a recording of your calls. You can also download programs for Windows and Mac computers.


For Mac, "QuickTime Player" offers simple audio recording and playback.
Similarly, on a PC, "Sound Recorder" offers the same functionality.

Audacity is a free application for all platforms, including Linux.
If you have an iPad or another iPhone you can use to record, the "Voice Memos" application will work well.
 This works best if you're in a quiet room. You will be placing your call on speaker.
 If you're using a laptop or a tablet, make sure the microphone is near your phone. If you're using an external mic, position it so that it's pointing at the bottom of your iPhone.
 This process will vary depending on the hardware you're using, but in most cases it will entail opening the recording software and selecting a "New Recording" option.
 Do so before making your call so that you have the beginning of the call on record., To do this, tap the Phone app--a green app with a white phone icon--tap the Keypad option at the bottom of the screen, type in the number of the person whom you wish to call, and tap the green "Call" button at the bottom of the screen.


You can also select a contact or a recent call from the Contacts or Recents options at the bottom of the screen.
 You'll see this option in the top-right corner of the call options, directly below the number you're calling. Doing so will enable the speaker for this call, which will broadcast the call's audio loudly enough for your recorder to pick it up.

When the caller answers, be sure to inform them that they are being recorded.

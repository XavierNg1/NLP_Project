 Fewer calories in equals more calories lost. More calories lost equals a smaller everything--including your bottom. Cutting the calories with exercise may not be enough; you have to monitor your eating habits, too.



1 pound is 3,500 calories. If losing 10 lbs is your first goal, cutting 500 calories a day will equal the loss of 1 lb per week, 10 weeks in total. But don't forget: exercise cuts out the calories, too.
 So often carbs and fats are made into villains. However, there are good carbs and good fats that are very important to your diet; they give your body energy, maintain your metabolism and help your digestive system absorb vitamins.Avocados, olives, nuts, olive oil and salmon all have good unsaturated fats that you shouldn't feel guilty about. They'll also keep you satiated, keeping you from overeating later.
Whole-grain and whole-wheat breads, cereals and pasta, oatmeal, couscous, quinoa and brown rice are good carbs that provide fiber, energy, and keep your insulin levels normal.
 Both of these food groups help you build muscle and are full of nutrition. It'll be easier to burn the midnight oil and get you through those hefty workouts.



Eggs, turkey, chicken, fish and low-fat yogurts, cheeses, milk and cottage cheese are all good options. If you opt for red meat, make sure it's lean.
 To cut the calories, you're going to have to eliminate the bad fats and empty calories. That means no junk food and no sodas. On either, your body doesn't get full and stores the junk in with your fat cells.



Load up on the fruit and vegetables. They are low-calorie but still dense, providing you nutrition, few calories, energy, and leaving you fuller longer.

Drink water. Two cups before every meal will fill you up, hydrate you, and keep the weight off.You'll also have less time to consume those sugary, high-calorie drinks that do nothing for your body's nutrition or waistline.

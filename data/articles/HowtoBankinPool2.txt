 It’s important to observe where the balls are in relation to one another in order to select the right pockets for reference. Plan out your shot ahead of time by selecting a target pocket that you want to sink the object ball in.

Generally speaking, the best target pocket is the one that’s closest with the least amount of obstructions.
When sighting your shot, use the diamond that’s an equal distance between the cue ball and the target pocket.
 Imagine that the line extends from the opening of the pocket straight to the opposite rail. This is what’s known as the “cross pocket line.” Make a mental snapshot of this line and hold it in your mind.The cross pocket line is the one you ordinarily use to line up straight shots.
If you need help visualizing the line, try laying your cue across the table at the appropriate angle.
 This line, also called the “ball pocket line,” will run from the center of the object ball to the pocket mirroring the one you’re targeting. If you’re shooting for a corner pocket, for example, the ball pocket line should be drawn at the other corner pocket on the same end of the table.By using opposing pockets to draw your lines, you’re effectively sectioning off the table to create a central focal point.
 The cross pocket and ball pocket lines will form an “X.” Draw one more short line from the middle of the X directly to the opposite rail. This is the “bank point line,” and it indicates where you should aim to set up a proper mirror angle and sink a difficult bank shot.After you’ve found the bank point line, you can set up your shot the way you normally would, only with a definite visual guide in mind.
Use the diamonds to keep track of the position of the blank point line.
Picturing cross pocket lines is a quicker, simpler way to calculate angles during competitive play than counting diamonds.

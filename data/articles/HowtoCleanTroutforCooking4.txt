 After reeling in your fresh catch, place it in an ice-filled cooler immediately. The trout needs to stay cold in order to slow down decomposition. Make sure the cooler you bring along with you is large enough to accommodate a large haul.Drain the cooler periodically and repack it with fresh ice—soaking in water for too long will dull the flavor of the fish.
On all-day outings, you can also keep the trout alive by pulling it alongside the boat on a stringer or transferring it a large container full of fresh water., Certain species of freshwater fish have been known to harbor parasites, which can be harmful if ingested. Inspect the body cavity and meat of the trout closely before you cook and eat it. Most visible parasites look like tiny worms or insects, and may be found on the inside or outside of the fish.Disposing of the skin and intestines will eliminate the majority of parasites, while making sure the fish is properly cooked will take care of the rest.
Not all parasites can be seen with the naked eye. To minimize health risks, cook the trout for at least five minutes at 140°F (60°C) or higher., Wrap the dressed trout in plastic or wax paper and stash it one of the lower drawers in the refrigerator. Refrigerated trout should stay at a temperature of 32°F (0°C) or below, while frozen fish needs to be kept at right around 0°F (-17°C). No matter how you decide to store your catch, the sooner you eat it, the better it will taste.Try to consume fresh trout within two to three days of refrigeration. Frozen trout will typically stay good for three to six months, or in some cases up to a full year.A vacuum sealer can be a wise investment if you tend to freeze your fresh catch regularly.

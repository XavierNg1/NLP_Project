 You will probably need to refer to online lectures and notes when you study. Therefore, you will need a study space where your internet access will not be interrupted. Internet access will be particularly important during things like study sessions for your class.You can study at home, if you know you won't distract yourself. Many people, however, have difficulty concentrating when they try to study at home. This is one of the challenges of online courses.
A place like an internet cafe usually has reliable internet access, as well as some coffee shops and restaurants. Just make sure workers won't mind you hanging around these places for long hours while you study.
You can also try a library.;
, Maintaining a strict schedule is vital to success in an online course. Even though you may not be required to attend classes or lectures at particular times, you still need to keep up with the course material on your own time. Therefore, self-discipline is important. Set a time each week to log onto the class and study materials.You may have some regular lecture times you need to attend. However, you should also make time on your own end for review. This is especially important if you're required to review some of the course material on your own.
To make an online class feel as vigorous as an in-person course, choose the same times and days to log in each week. Set a specific timeframe for how long you'll read and review materials. You can, for example, log in from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to study.
 Oftentimes, deadlines won't be as obvious in an online course. As you won't be attending lectures every day, where you'll be reminded of due dates, making a calendar for your own reference is important.You can make a physical calendar for yourself if you study at home. Write down things like the dates papers are due and the dates of tests and quizzes. This will help let you know when you need to start committing to reviewing materials.
You can also make a calendar on your phone or laptop. This may be more helpful if you don't study at home, as you'll be able to refer to it while you're out studying.
 It can be hard to stick to a schedule for an online course. This is especially true if you're allowed to do things like watch lectures on your own time. However, be strict with yourself about adhering to your schedule. Self-discipline is vital to your success in an online course.Remember, just because you don't go to the course in person does not mean it is not costing you money or that it does not affect your overall GPA. Make sure to treat an online course as seriously as you would treat a course you attend in person.
 Sometimes, a computer can be a distraction. It can be helpful to turn your laptop off at times to study. In addition to helping you study away from your computer, you can highlight printed out materials and also make notes in the margins.You should also print out things like a course schedule and syllabus. It's good to have a physical copy of these materials to refer to throughout the course.
 You should take notes online as rigorously as you would during a physical lecture. Sit with a pen and paper and take careful, legible notes in front of your computer. You can also type up your notes in a word document.Use headings and dates to keep track of what materials are covered in each section of your notes. You can refer to these headings later when studying.Do not try to record every single detail an instructor said. Instead, jot down the general idea and any insights that help you better understand the material. Later, when you're studying, you can refer to your notes to remember the major ideas of the course.
Even if you can re-watch lectures, taking notes is still helpful. It helps better remember the material later and you can also write down key material. If you need to, say, remember a date, you can refer to your notes instead of searching the video for the specific moment when this date was mentioned.
 If something is really difficult to understand, try writing it down. You can also try writing and re-writing anything you have to memorize. This can be a helpful technique for studying for any course, including an online one.You can recopy your notes onto a new sheet of paper.
You can also write down vocabulary words, dates, names of important figures, and other information you need to memorize.
 If you're really struggling to understand something, reading it out loud can help. You will both see and hear the material, helping you better commit it to memory. If a lot of your online course material is text, this can be very helpful. If you have written lectures, for example, you won't hear them read out loud by an instructor. It can help to read them out loud yourself.You can also try summarizing the material from memory out loud. You can, for example, pretend you're explaining a concept to another student.
 Never go into a study session undirected. Have specific goals each time you sit down to study. You can break the material up into chunks and study one chunk at a time. Make a schedule for yourself, with individual study sessions divided by topic.You should also remember your overall academic goals when you study. This can help with your motivation. Think about how a good grade will contribute to your overall GPA. Think about how the material will benefit you after the course.
 Simple memorization can only go so far. One of the most effective means to memorize material is giving yourself tests and quizzes. Quizzing can improve memorization because of a process called "retrieval." Every time a memory is retrieved, it becomes more accessible in the future. If there are practice tests and quizzes available online, take as many as you can. You can also make up tests and quizzes for yourself.Flash cards can be a great way to test yourself on things like vocabulary and dates.
You can also write down potential exam questions as you study. This can be very helpful if you're expecting an essay test. After you finish studying, take the test you made for yourself.
 Studying for long hours can easily lead to burnout. It's important to take breaks as you study. Take a break about every hour or so. Do something fun, like watch TV for a few minutes or go for a brief walk, and then return to your materials. You will find yourself feeling refreshed and recharged after a quick break., Remember, your instructor in an online course is a valuable resource. Just because you don't see them every day does not mean you can't reach out to them. If you stumble across anything confusing while studying, do not hesitate to send your instructor an email asking for clarification.If you have a web camera, try setting up a video chat meeting with your instructor for face-to-face feedback.

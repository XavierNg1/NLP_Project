 Build a relationship with your school’s disability resource team before the start of the term. They will inform your teachers (with your permission) about any necessary accommodations and help you acquire audio recordings of your textbooks. They can also offer any equipment training you might need to improve your ability to use assistive technologies., When it comes time to take a test, ensure that you’re afforded the proper testing accommodations. These may include the use of readers, scribes, word processors, print magnification, and extra time to take tests.The disability support office will help you arrange accommodations. In addition, their staff will likely administer your tests in a separate, quiet setting.
 Assistive apps make it easier to study your notes and textbooks, and are especially useful for materials that don’t already have an audio component. Consider downloading apps for your iOS or Android device such as TapTapSee (http://taptapseeapp.com/) or KNFB Reader (http://www.knfbreader.com/).

 Place a few inches of oil in a cast iron skillet or a large dutch oven. Heat the oil over medium high heat until it reaches 350 °F (177 °C). Test to make sure it's hot by placing a piece of garlic or onion in the oil; if it bubbles and simmers, the oil is hot and ready.
 Use a spatula to gently lay the croquettes in the oil, one at a time. Fry them on one side for 2 to 3 minutes, then flip them over and fry on the other side until they are golden brown. Remove them and drain them on a plate with paper towels.


Don't overcook the croquettes. Since the chicken inside has already been cooked, there's no need to fry them past the point of turning golden brown.
Take care when you lift the croquettes from the pan, to make sure they don't fall apart.

 If you're taking the trouble to write a letter by hand, it's nice to add a date on the top left corner of the paper. Many people save letters for years to come, and they like to be able to see what day and year it was written to reminisce about earlier times. Write out the date - for example, "May 7, 2013" - or abbreviate it using only numbers indicating the month, day and year.
 The beginning of a letter, whether it's handwritten or in the form of an email, is called a salutation. That's where you address the person to whom you're writing by name - for example, "Dear Emily" or "Hello, Skylar." Think about the nature of your relationship with the letter recipient, as well as your own preferences and style, and choose your greeting accordingly.


If you tend to like to write in a slightly formal style, using "Dear" in your salutation is a nice choice. It sounds typical, but think about it: calling someone "dear" is actually very sweet, and indicates that you care about him or her. However, you don't have to read into it; "dear" is as appropriate for a letter to your best friend as it is for a letter to an acquaintance you just met.
For a letter that is more casual in tone, consider beginning it with "Hi, " or "Hello, ." This greeting is appropriate for a friend or relative, but don't begin a business letter this way; it's a bit too casual.
Write a more personal greeting for someone with whom you are intimate, or want to be. For example, "Dearest ," "My " or "Sweet ."
Be sure to end your greeting with a comma. It is also formally correct to begin the body of the letter on the next line.

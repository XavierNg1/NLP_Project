, When you are asked to press any key to continue, press any key.
 Unless you have multiple operating systems and hard drives, you may only see one option. Choose the one marked “Windows” and make note of the drive letter (it’s probably C: or D:). Make sure the radio button next to “Use recovery tools” is checked and click “Next.”

, This will launch a black window with a prompt where you will type all of the following commands to rename some files:


Type C: or D: (the drive letter you made note of earlier) and press ↵ Enter

Type windows\system32 and press ↵ Enter

Type ren utilman.exe utilhold.exe and press ↵ Enter

Type copy cmd.exe utilman.exe and press ↵ Enter

Type exit and press ↵ Enter


, When the sign-in screen appears, click the Ease of Access button in the lower left corner of the screen. Usually that button opens the Ease of Access center, but this time it will open the Command Prompt (you’ll change it back in a minute).
 Type net user yourusername yournewpassword, but replace “yourusername” with your username and “yournewpassword” with a new password. Type exit to close the command prompt.
 Use the new password you just set to log back in.
 Type command into the text field and wait for “Command Prompt” to appear in the search results. When you see “Command Prompt,” use the right mouse button to click on it and select “Run as Administrator.”

, Now you’ll undo the file renaming you a little while ago.


Type C: (or whichever drive letter you made note of earlier) and press ↵ Enter.
Type cd windows\system32 and press ↵ Enter

Type copy utilhold.exe utilman.exe and press ↵ Enter

Type exit and press ↵ Enter.

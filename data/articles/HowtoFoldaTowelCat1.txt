 Be sure to orient it in the “landscape” position in front of you (i.e. long sides up and down, short sides left and right).
 It may help to imagine that you’re rolling up a scroll., Simply place one hand about a third of the way in on one side, lift the rolled towel, and fold the shorter end underneath the rest. The folded part of the towel will be the kitty’s hindquarters and the stretched part of the towel will be the body and front legs. Leave the folded roll alone for the time being.

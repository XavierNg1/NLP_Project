Ignore the American Academy of Pediatrics. Their advice would have you pouring most of your breast milk down the drain in the name of maximizing nutrition per swallow. Your lucky baby is getting milk much more easily thanks to those fancy standard bottles.
If the quality of the milk is diminished 2% because you followed the CDC guidelines instead of the AAP, your baby will more than make up for it by being able to drink much more milk with the same amount of effort as a breast-fed baby.
 You can pump directly into your standard size bottles (that's why they're called standard) or into bags that you attach to the bottles with a rubber band.


When you once struggled to give your baby a full 2 oz. meal, it can be exciting to fill a bag to bursting with 10 oz. or more. But when it comes time to thaw, you'll wish you had two smaller bags. You'll probably be happiest with bags of 6 oz. or less.
 This way, you'll be storing a flat rectangle instead of a lumpy bag. When it's time to freeze another bag, transfer your newly frozen bag to a shoebox or similar container in the back of the freezer.

 You should be able to find a variety of brands at your local grocery store or convenience store. Some popular brands include Veet, Nair, and Moom. There are different types of cream for the different types of hair that grow on the body, so don't try to remove all the hair on your legs with a cream meant for your upper lip or your bikini line!

, In the shower or bathtub, clean your skin with a gentle soap and warm water. Dry them well after you've cleansed the area to be treated.
 These hair removal creams eat through your hair, so it's no surprise they can damage your skin if it's sensitive or if you leave the cream on for too long.









Using the applicator, spread the cream over a small patch of skin
Let it sit for as long as the instructions on the box say to
Rinse the cream off
Wait 24 hours to make sure your skin has no adverse reactions to the cream

, Depending on the product you purchase, your specific instructions may be different, so read those instructions carefully. It's very important that you follow the time recommendation on the box precisely, because leaving the cream on for longer than recommended can results in painful burns and ugly scabs!


Don't try to rub the cream into your legs. It's not meant to disappear like lotion, but to sit on the surface of your skin.
 Once the recommended amount of time has passed, use a warm, wet washcloth to wipe the cream off your legs. Be gentle because your skin may feel sensitive. You'll probably want to rinse your legs off in the shower or bathtub to make sure you've removed all the cream.
 If you want your newly smoothed legs to looks shiny and healthy, you want to rub them with a good quality lotion or oil every day. Use a lotion with aloe in it if your skin feels a little sensitive after you rinse the hair removal cream off.

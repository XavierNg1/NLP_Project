 While there are no medications made specifically to treat lung fluke infections, luckily there are some anti-parasitic medications that can eliminate the infection. Praziquantel, which is commonly used to treat tapeworms, is a medication commonly used to treat lung fluke infections. This medication is typically given daily for three days and it will eliminate the lung flukes.Fenbendazole, another anti-parasitic drug, is another treatment that might be used. This is typically taken daily for ten to fourteen days.
 If your cat's lung fluke infection is advanced, it may cause the cat to have additional problems. These need to be treated separately, in addition to the treatment for the parasitic infection. Discuss treatment options with your veterinarian and begin treatment as soon as possible.


For example, your can may have gotten pneumonia due to the lung fluke infection. This typically needs to be treated with antibiotics., As your cat is treated for its infection, the respiratory symptoms it was experiencing should go away. If the cat's symptoms do not begin to clear up after several days for treatment, you should seek out further veterinary treatment.


Call your veterinarian if you are concerned about your cat's lack of recovery. They should advise you about whether or not you should bring your cat back in for assessment.

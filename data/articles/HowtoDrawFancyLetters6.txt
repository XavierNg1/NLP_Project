 Stencils are a great way to ensure smooth and even lettering. There are many different types of italicized fonts to choose from., The first step is to use a pencil to trace your letters. This way you can fix any errors or spacing issues. Once your letters look the way you want, trace over them with a good pen that is meant for fancy lettering. These pens offer finer tips and a smoother glide so your letters flow nicely., After you have traced out your letters, go back and add some creative design. You can add dots along the lines, draw curly designs that stem out from the letters, or add color. The design is up to you.

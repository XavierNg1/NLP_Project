 This will be from someone you've never met, usually in a distant country. These emails are often badly spelled and punctuated, and ask you to send the scammer your personal information in order to receive a large amount of money. (You will never see this money, as they are attempting to rob you by asking for several thousand dollars for some kind of hidden, as-yet unmentioned fee.);
, Tell them you're interested in the deal, and want more information. You may want to hint that you're very wealthy and devoid of personal morals, just to keep them on the hook.
 If you don't hear from him a few days after your initial email, send it again.
 Keep the scammer chasing after you for as long as possible without ever sending him money or giving out your information.

A dispenser can usually shoot farthest. However, there are some items a dispenser can't shoot. Because if different weight, dispensers and droppers have their own range of things.;

The item with a higher average is more likely to be a dispenser. A dropper cannot shoot as far. To find this average, compare how far several different items were shot.



These rhyming sounds are not the only thing in correlation to each other. If you look closely at the two items mouths, a dropper has a mouth shaped like a hopper. That can help you remember, dropper hopper.



The bottle will explode in xp points when shot out of a dispenser. However, a dropper will just drop what ever is in it. This results in the bottle being unharmed.
 A dispenser likes to explode things, but the dropper is more careful.

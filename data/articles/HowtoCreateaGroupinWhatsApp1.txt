 If you don't already have it, WhatsApp for iPhone is free to download from the App Store.


If you can't find WhatsApp on your iPhone, swipe down from the middle of the screen and type "WhatsApp" into the ensuing search bar. You should see WhatsApp's icon pop up at the top of this menu.;

 This should be in the top right corner of the Chats menu.


You will need to have at least one chat in your Chats menu before you can create a group; if you've only just installed WhatsApp, simply send a one-word chat to a contact in order to activate the "New Group" option.
 You can do this with up to 256 people; the name and icon of each person you add will show up at the top of your screen as you add contacts.


You can also search for specific contacts from within the search bar at the top of the WhatsApp screen.
You cannot add people who aren't currently in your contacts.
 This will take you to the "New Group" creation page. From here, you can:


Add a "Group Subject" to name the group (25 character maximum).
Add a photo by tapping the camera icon on the left of the Group Subject field.
Delete participants from the group before you officially form it.
 You have officially created a group in WhatsApp!

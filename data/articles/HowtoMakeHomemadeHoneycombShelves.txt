 This will be your setting for the entire project and you won’t have to adjust.;
, Make the first 30-degree cut on your first plank of wood and then turn it over to measure the long edge.


Measure 12” and mark with a pencil. This is where you will make your next cut.
Make the second cut along the edge you marked. Your first piece of wood has been cut.
Repeat this process for the rest of the planks. You should end up cutting 15 pieces of wood.



Lay out hexagon before drilling together. Stand pieces of wood on its side (so the piece looks 3-D) and make a hexagon shape. For best results, start with the honeycomb base and work your way from there.
Glue sides together with wood glue when you are completely sure you like the way the shelf looks. Press and hold together for a few minutes.
Drill sides together by pre drilling holes first. Then add screws using your electric drill. Start at the base and work your way outward.
 Lay hexagons out on the floor and join them together, making sure the sides line up with each other.


Add wood glue to the exterior sides of the hexagon shelf, followed by drilled holes.
Sand entire shelf, including all areas of the honeycomb.
 Be sure you have an obvious bottom and base for your shelf.

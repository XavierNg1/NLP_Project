 The river red gum grows to a height of around 20 meters (65.6 ft), and sometimes up to 45 meters (147.6 ft), so it requires a lot of space and should not be planted close to buildings or your residence. It is best in large gardens, in parks, and on farms.;
, The river red gum isn't that fussy about soil type. While it is typically found at river sites with sandy, alluvial soils, it's also happily at home in open-forest and woodland on floodplains. Hence, it'll probably be fine wherever you choose to plant it.
 Remove the tree from its casing and gently place in the ground. Firm the soil around the tree and water in well.
 Keep the area free of weeds and guard against frost while it is establishing itself.
 When the weather is dry for an extended period, prune the tree to avoid fungal diseases.

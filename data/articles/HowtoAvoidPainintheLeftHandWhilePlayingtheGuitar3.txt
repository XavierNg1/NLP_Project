It is easy to damage your neck, and you should take your guitar to a trusted repair shop for an easy adjustment.If you cannot afford to have your guitar's action fixed by a repair technician, consider using a capo on the first fret of the guitar as a temporary alternative. Placing a capo on the first fret helps bring the strings closer to the frets.
Older guitars require you to remove the neck to access the truss rod.
 Neck shapes play a major role in the comfort of playing. Different brands and styles of guitar offer many neck styles and shapes to their customers. Always try out a guitar before buying it. Similar to buying a new pair of shoes, you want to try out guitars that not only sound great, but also feel right.


You can also change your the neck of your current guitar. The process isn't too complex and it could be a more economical solution.
Fat necks are usually viewed in the guitar world as sturdy and reliable necks. This style of neck could be difficult for beginners. Try out several styles of necks before making any decisions.
 Prepare for soreness and stiffness. With that in mind, a novice guitarist should not expect to have the same level of stamina exhibited by a more experienced guitarist. If pain in your fretting hand persists for longer than two days, you should let a doctor examine your hand. You body lets you know something is wrong whenever pain becomes acute. Unlike weightlifting, where some pain is gain, in the guitar world persistent pain could mean trouble.

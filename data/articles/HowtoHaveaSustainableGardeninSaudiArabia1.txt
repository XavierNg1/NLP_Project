 Test the soil in your garden for salinity.


If it is too salty, remove and replace with sweet sand. Mix perlite and commercial potting mix.  
All soil types in desert environments will benefit from adding organic compost.;
, Where possible, use native plants or prefer plants that grow well in heat and do not need a lot of water.
 Your choice of plants will depend on the amount of sun the yard gets in a day. Know each plant's sun requirements. For example:


 Bougainvilla and lantana are two beautiful plants that are sun lovers.  
Hibiscus grows well in partly shady area. If attacked by aphids just give a good water hose blasting and it will be fine.
Cana Lily loves a sunny spot with plenty of moist.
Red palm, if placed outside, needs to be in a partially shaded area.  
Chinese ferns do well in partially shaded location with micro-climate environment.

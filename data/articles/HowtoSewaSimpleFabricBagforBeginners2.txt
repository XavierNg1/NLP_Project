 The fabric should be strong enough to carry items and to be used on a regular basis. If you want to use flimsier fabric, you'll need lining fabric as well, which adds to the complexity of making the bag, so only do this if it's really necessary.
 Double this measurement and draw it onto the piece of fabric you're going to use (use a fabric marker). The shape should be either a rectangle or a square.



If using lining as well, you'll need to cut this out at the same time.
 The fold now becomes the base of the bag and it's already ready for stitching together.


If using lining, place it on the fabric's wrong side before folding. Pin in place, then stitch onto the fabric, all the way around. Then fold the whole piece, lining side facing outward.
 Stitch from the base end of the bag to the end of each side. Leave the top portion unstitched; this becomes the bag's opening.
 Stitch this folded edge in place, neatly, taking care to not catch the other side of the bag (the bag opening must stay open). This folded portion creates a neat and stronger edge for the bag.
 You now have the base section of the bag. All you need to do now is add handles.
 To keep things simple, prefer one strap only for the bag. Decide on the length of the strap, remember that when it's over your should, the length halves. Cut out a strip of the same fabric to the measurement you've made. The width of this should be about 4 inches/10cm.


If lining the strap, cut the lining to the same measurements, then stitch or glue the lining to the wrong side of the strap fabric before proceeding with the next step.
Fold the strap piece in half, right side facing out. Stitch the joined section together.
Stitch one end of the strap to one end of the bag's opening. Repeat for the other end of the strap, on the opposite side of the bag.
Remove any thread or excess pieces of fabric.
 The simple bag is now complete.

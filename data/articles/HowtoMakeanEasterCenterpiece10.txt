 The above ideas scratch the surface of what is possible by way of a centerpiece. The best things to keep in mind include:


Aim to keep it inexpensive. Reuse or upcycle whatever you already have around the home.
Try to use items from your own garden and cooking where possible, to give it an authentic feel.
Avoid overdoing the centerpiece. It's great to make it the talk of the table but not to have people banging their heads on it or knocking it over every time they go to eat or pass the salt!
Try to work in heirlooms. These are a way of connecting to the past and remembering people you care about who are no longer with you.

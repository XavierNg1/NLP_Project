 This may depend on people's availability but Sunday is the most typical day to choose for brunch over Easter. Some people have friends and family over for Good Friday brunch, with hot cross buns in the starring role, but others prefer to keep this day private.


Be sure to check that the people you'd like to come will be around. Some people choose to travel over Easter.;
, Email invites are fine unless you want to go to the trouble of sending out card invitations. Specify whether you'd like your guests to bring anything or not.
 There are lots of possibilities for an Easter brunch but focus on things that are especially enjoyed at Easter time.

Crepes, Nutella crepes or chocolate crepes


Hash brown potatoes, hash brown casserole or baked eggs in hash nests

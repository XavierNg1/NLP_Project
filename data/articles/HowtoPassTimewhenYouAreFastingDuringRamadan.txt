 It is important to read the Quran during Ramadan. Have a daily goal on how much you are going to read each day.;
, It is good to have a lot of Suras stored in mind, so keep memorizing more, and revise the ones that you have already memorized.
, The ability to do this will depend on where you are living. If you live in a burning hot place like Saudi Arabia, you should probably stay inside.
 Invite a friend over or go to a friend's house. It will help pass time. But again, stay inside!

, If it is an okay temperature in the day, consider going out to the mosque or to get anything you will need for iftar (break of the fast). Try going out with somebody, as conversation is a great way to pass time.
 Fasting is not an excuse to not help out in doing work. Broom the house, water the plants. Small jobs like this will help your mom or dad out, and will pass time.


Once it gets to about two to three hours before the break of the fast, help out in the kitchen; you will be busy doing a task and you won't notice the time passing.
 If you do not have school or work the next day, stay up until Al- Fajr, then sleep afterwards. You should see yourself waking up at noon!


Have a nap during the day if needed, including after the evening's food has been prepared but before it is time to break the fast.
 There is nothing wrong with watching some TV; just don't watch the food shows.
 Buy or re-read a very interesting book, or recite/ read the holy Qur'an, and time will fly by!

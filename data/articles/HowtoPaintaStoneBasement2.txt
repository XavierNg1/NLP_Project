 Masonry primers will adhere to the stone walls better and provide more durability than general primers. Masonry primers also protect the stone from water damage.
 With the lid on, vigorously shake the primer container to mix the contents.
, Follow the instructions for your specific masonry primer. If no directions were supplied, follow these general guidelines for applying masonry primer to stone walls.


Use a wide nylon/polyester brush to apply the primer. The brush should be between 2 and 3 inches (5 and 7.6 cm). Avoid rollers when painting stone basement walls because the roller won't get the paint into the small uneven surfaces of the stone. The rugged stone surface also could tear a roller cover.
Cut in a 2- to 3-inch (5- to 7.6-cm) border around the top, bottom and sides of the stone walls. Start by applying masonry primer in 1 corner and continue along the edge of the wall.
Paint the masonry primer onto the stone walls in 4-foot by 2-foot (1.2-m by .6-m) sections. As you apply the primer, overlap into the previously applied and cut in areas for consistent coverage.
 For best results, let the masonry primer dry for a minimum of 8 hours.

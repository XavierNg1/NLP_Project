 You'll need a head, nose and ears to form the cow cake as a whole. Prepare each cake as follows:


Trim around the top rim of the smaller cake. Then cut a crescent shape from one side. You should be left with a slightly off-centre oval shape.
Position the smaller shaped cake on the nearest edge of the larger cake. It should look like a nose.
Cut a third off the fairy cakes, and position above the sponge for the ears. The image shows exactly what is expected.;
, Fill a piping bag with white buttercream. Use as follows:


Using a star nozzle, cover the cake in buttercream stars.
Leave some areas blank so you have space for the black icing.
 Position two regular chocolate buttons for the nostrils, and two giant chocolate buttons for the eyes.


Dab a little buttercream onto the giant chocolate buttons, and stick a Smartie to each to give the eyes some life.
 Add some black food colouring to the buttercream and mix it in thoroughly. Fill a piping bag with this black buttercream, and fill in the spaces on the cake with black buttercream stars.
 Use a red strawberry shoelace to make a smiley mouth. It is now complete and ready to serve.


Add some sugar daisies to give the cow a little colour.

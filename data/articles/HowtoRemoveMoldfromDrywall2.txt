 As you work, mold spores could break free from the drywall. To prevent them from finding their way into the flooring, cover the flooring and anything in the surrounding area with plastic sheeting. Tape the sheeting in place.
 Use a pencil to lightly draw a box around every area with visible mold. The area should be larger than the stain itself and should span an area that extends over at least two wooden wall beams behind the drywall. Removing more wall than necessary will increase your odds of removing unseen mold spores and will also make it possible to replace the section of drywall.
 Saw along the line with your knife, pointing it out and away from you as you work. When the patch of drywall comes free, carefully remove it and set it down, mold-side up, on the plastic.
 Mold spores may have been stirred up during the process, but using a HEPA vacuum should remove them.
 Sometimes it can take 5 minutes of spraying with water before any leak will show itself. Once located, seal from both the outside and inside to prevent moisture coming in (again mold is only caused where there is moisture).
 Cut a new section of drywall. Use a tape measure to measure the hole and, using a utility knife, cut a piece of fresh drywall that fits the exact same measurements.
 It should be a tight, snug fit.
 Use drywall screws and a screwdriver to attach the drywall to the wooden beams in the wall behind it.
 Joint compound, also called drywall compound, should be applied to the perimeter of the new section of drywall to help join it with the rest of the wall and to seal any cracks in between the sections.
 After 24 hours have passed, you can use sandpaper or a gentle sander to smooth the dried joint compound out.
 Mold spores could have landed on surrounding wall or flooring, even with the plastic coverings in place. Remove as much as possible with a HEPA vacuum.

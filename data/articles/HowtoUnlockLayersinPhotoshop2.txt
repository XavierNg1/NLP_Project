 Some file formats, specifically "Indexed Color," don't have full compatibility with Photoshop. Luckily, they can be quickly changed, opening up full layer control:


Click on "Image" from the top bar of Photoshop. Your image must be open already.
Click on "Mode".
Click on "RGB Color" to temporarily set your color settings to something manageable., The layer's palette has several buttons above the actual layers. Clicking on the padlock will lock whatever layer (or layers, as you can Ctrl/Cmd-Click multiple at once) you have highlighted. It will also unlock it. Note, however, that this will never work on the background layer., The keyboard shortcut for locking layers is Ctrl/Cmd + /. This locks and unlocks all selected layers.



Mac: Cmd + /

PC: Ctrl + / , This shortcut opens everything up for editing, other than the background. Note, however, that the background layer, the one locked from the beginning, will not be affected. The shortcuts, depending on your system, are as follows:



Mac: Cmd + Opt + /

PC: Ctrl + Alt + / , You can actually lock certain parts of a layer for more precise editing. These buttons are all right next to the padlock button, and will display their names if you hover the mouse over them. Try out:



Lock Transparent Pixels: Icon is a checkerboard. This makes it so that you can't edit over anything transparent in the layer, meaning nothing underneath the layer will be accidentally affected.

Lock Image Pixels: Icon is a paintbrush. You cannot edit anything but the transparent parts of the layer.

Lock Pixel Position: Icon is a crossroads. Prevents you from moving the layer at all, though you can still paint, re-color, and add text.

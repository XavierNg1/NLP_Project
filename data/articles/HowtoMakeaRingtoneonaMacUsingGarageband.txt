 Choose a song that you think describes you, that you like, and that would be deemed appropriate if someone heard your phone go off.;
, Find where your song is located and click and drag. If the song is on a CD, open the CD in a Finder window, and then click and drag the song into GarageBand. If it is in iTunes, click and drag from iTunes. Let go of the song when you see a little green plus sign bubble in the GarageBand window.
 If the song is not moved all the way to the left, drag it so that the beginning is as far left as possible.
 If you opened GarageBand and made a new song, there might be a "grand piano track" or other instrument track in your song. Select the unneeded track and press "delete".
 Select a small portion of the song you want to be your ringtone. The file has to be relatively small in order for it to be sent over to your phone, so choose anywhere from 10 seconds to 20 seconds worth of the song. To delete unneeded portions:

Click the "eye tool" on the bottom left






Highlight the part of the song you do not want






Delete the remaining unwanted parts by pressing "delete"







, If your song is not all the way to the left after editing out the unwanted parts, slide it to the left again.
 If this is not moved, it could make the ringtone unnecessarily long and thus make it a bigger file. Depending upon the length of the original song that was dragged into GarageBand, it could take awhile for the play head to scroll right until the purple arrow can be seen. Once it is found, drag it until it lines up with the end of the song.
 Select "Share" in the top menu bar, and then "Send Song To iTunes". Fill in the necessary information in the drop-down box. You may need to consider the file format, as well, if you are making a ringtone for a phone other than an iPhone. iPhones use MPEG-4, renamed to .m4r and other phones, such as the new Windows phones, like .mp3 or .wma. So, there may be more converting to be done.
 Open up your email account and then compose a new email. Select whatever you want for the "Subject:" and "Message:" fields. In the "To:" field, type in your ten digit phone number. Depending on what service you have select the proper ending for the email address:

 The point will not be on the given line, and can be above or below it. Think of this point as one vertex of a rhombus. Since opposite sides of a rhombus are parallel, by drawing a rhombus we can construct a parallel line. If the line and point are not already labeled, you might want to label them to easily keep track of the steps.

For example, you might have line m{\displaystyle m} and point A{\displaystyle A}.
 To do this, set the compass tip on the given point and draw an arc that intersects the given line at some point. Do not change the width of the compass.

It does not matter how wide you set the compass, as long as it can intersect the given line.

Make sure the arc reaches above the given point and intersects the given line.

For example, you should set the compass tip at point A{\displaystyle A} and create an arc that intersects line m{\displaystyle m} at point B{\displaystyle B}.
 Using the same compass width, set the compass tip at the second vertex, and draw an arc that intersects the given line at a new point. Do not change the width of the compass.

The arc only has to be long enough to show where it intersects the given line.

For example, you should set the compass tip at point B{\displaystyle B} and create an arc that intersects line m{\displaystyle m} at point C{\displaystyle C}.
 Using the same compass width, set the compass at the third vertex, and draw an arc that intersects the first arc you drew (through the second vertex).

The arc only has to be long enough to show where it intersects the first arc.

For example, you should set the compass tip at point C{\displaystyle C} and create an arc that intersects the first arc at point D{\displaystyle D}.
 This line will pass through the given point and be parallel to the given line, as the two lines form two opposite sides of a rhombus.

For example, a line drawn through point A{\displaystyle A} and point D{\displaystyle D} will be parallel to line m{\displaystyle m}.

 When interacting and conversing with him, be aware of your body language. Negative body language can cause a negative reaction or create tension between you two. Be extra careful of your tone of voice, how you use your eyes, and the way you greet him.Don’t roll your eyes, sigh audibly, click your tongue, or suck in your teeth.
Remember to smile.
 Through your tone of voice, he will be able to sense that you are talking down to him. If he cannot understand what you are saying, don't slow down your speech so he can understand your point better. This is the way adults talk to children. Instead, communicate better by explaining concepts he does not understand, or by using clearer language.Don't say, for example, "Do I need to explain it in simpler terms for you to understand?" Instead, say, "Let me it explain it better."
Or, “Were you able to find anything better to do over the weekend than getting uncontrollably drunk?” Instead, say, "What else did you do over the weekend?"

, If you notice the conversation is beginning to go in direction you do not like, try to switch the topic as soon as you can. Instead, bring up a happy or neutral topic.For example, “I didn’t get a chance to look into that,” or “I don’t know much about that topic, but how was your week, anyways?”

, Whenever you, your boyfriend, and his friend are hanging out, remember to make him feel included and welcome. Try not to make him feel like the third wheel. Instead, include him in conversations, and ask what he would prefer to do.For example, “I thought the movie was boring. What did you think about the movie, Joe?”
Or, “We are trying to decide what to do, do you have any suggestions? We would love your input.”

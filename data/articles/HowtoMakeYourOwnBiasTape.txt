Cut out strips of fabric for your bias tape. To do this, first mark your cutting lines on the fabric using chalk pencil or dressmaker's pen. Decide how wide you need your finished product to be, how long you need it, and whether or not you want it to be double fold or single fold (scroll to the bottom for pictures of both). If you make single fold, make your strips twice as wide as you want your finished product to be. If you make double fold, your strips need to be 4 times as wide as your finished tape. For example, for double fold, 1/2" wide, cut out 2" strips.
When you mark the cutting lines, remember this is bias tape, so the lines have to run at a 45 degree angle to the selvage.
Cut enough strips so that when they are sewn together you'll have the length you need plus some extra.
Keep in mind that the triangles formed at the ends are wasted, as is a small triangle underneath the strips (you could use it in a pinch, but the strips you get will be quite short).;
,

After you mark and cut the strips, square off the ends. The two strips on the left have been squared off - the ones on the right haven't been yet.,

Start attaching the strips. Place one over the other at a right angle, right sides together. Make sure the square ends line up.,

Stitch diagonally from corner to corner of the overlapping squares.


Sew all the strips together using the same method. The seam will look like this. Be sure that you are consistent with how you assemble your seams; otherwise you will end up with seams angling both directions.,,,

Press the seam allowances flat.


Fold the strip in half lengthwise, right side out, and press.


Open up the strip again. Now press both raw edges into the center. This is single fold bias tape.,

To make double fold bias tape, fold again in the center and press.

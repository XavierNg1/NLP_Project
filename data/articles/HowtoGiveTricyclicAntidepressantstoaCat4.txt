 Dampen a paper towel or some gauze. Squeeze out any excess water. Gently wipe the inner surface of your cat’s ear. This will prep its skin for the transdermal gel.Try not to stick the gauze into your cat’s ear canal.
 You can either place it on your lap, the bed, a couch or a chair. Stabilize your cat with one hand.If your cat seems anxious, pet and talk to it in a soothing voice until it is calm.
 This way you can prevent the medication from absorbing into your skin and body. Use latex gloves or a finger glove, i.e., a finger cot.If you are using a finger cot, make sure to place one on your index finger and one on your thumb.
 Make sure to dispense the correct dosage. Follow the directions per the instructions on the bottle in order to dispense the correct dosage., Apply the gel onto the inner surface of your cat’s ear, i.e., the area that you wiped clean. Gently massage the gel into the inner surface of the ear with your index finger. Massage it in until it is completely absorbed.Do not apply the gel onto abraded or broken skin.
Use a different ear each time you apply the gel.
 Use a paper towel to do this to avoid getting any medication on your skin. Discard the gloves in a separate trash bag and place it in your trashcan outside. Then wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap.If you have other pets and/or children, place your cat in a separate room for 15 minutes. This way you can prevent your cat from spreading the medication to your pets and/or children.

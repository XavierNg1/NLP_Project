 For this type of smoke bubble you’ll need a few more supplies, but you won’t jeopardize your lungs with this one. You will need the following:

Dry ice
Hammer
Dish soap or bubble liquid
Graduated cylinder or a similar container
Heavy rubber gloves;
, Fill whatever container you decide to use with warm water. Add enough water to reach just below the halfway mark on your container. A good alternative to a graduated cylinder is a clear flower vase. The water shouldn’t be boiling, but it shouldn’t be at room temperature. Somewhere in between the two will work., Place the heavy gloves on your hands before handling dry ice. Use a hammer to break up a larger piece of dry ice so that it will fit into your container.Handle this on a clean surface and be sure small scraps don’t land on your family dog., As you break up the dry ice, add it to the container filled with warm water. Don’t add all your dry ice on the first test.

Once you add dry ice, it will react to the warm water and produce smoke. The smoke will rise up and appear to overflow out of the container.
 Now to create smoke bubbles, add a generous portion (about a quarter of a cup) of either dish detergent or bubble liquid. Now your bubbling concoction has real bubbles floating out. Continue to add dry ice as it melts and watch your smoke bubbles flourish.

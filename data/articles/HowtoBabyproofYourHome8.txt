,, Children are more top-heavy than adults and can lean and fall into a toilet easily. They also can drown in just one inch of water.
 Also set the water heater thermostat to 120 degrees. It takes just three seconds for a child to sustain a third-degree burn from water at 140 degrees.
 Although baby oils are meant to be used in a child's bath, some of those products can be harmful. The reason is some baby and bath oils contain hydrocarbons in a liquid form. Those hydrocarbons cause a serious internal damage which can lead to death if the substance has been aspirated into the lungs. Make sure all such products are unreachable to children., Install safety taps and mark hot and cold water taps clearly. Place cleaning products out of reach or install a child-resistant cabinet or safety lock.·Lower the hot water system’s temperature to 50 degrees Celsius. Always supervise children aged under 5 years in the bath; check the water temperature is no higher than 38 degrees C and always run cold water first; run only enough water for washing and play (belly-button height) and empty the bath as soon as finished. ·

Get bath seats and rings. A baby should never be left alone in a bathtub. Even if the baby is located in a bath seat, you should still be watching it. A single suction cup on the bottom of the bath seat can suddenly release causing it to slide or tip over. Always watch over your baby during bath time and never leave bathroom, even for a moment.

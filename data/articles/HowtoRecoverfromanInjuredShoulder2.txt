 Begin your active rehabilitation with three isometric exercises (contractions that don't cause any motion).


The first exercise is done while facing a wall with your injured shoulder in-line with your upper body and your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle. Move up to the wall until your fist is in contact and then slowly apply pressure by pushing your first into the wall.
The second exercise starts with you in the same body alignment as the first exercise, but instead, contact the wall with your elbow through to your hand. Slowly try to raise your arm to the side while maintaining proper posture.
The third exercise begins the same position, but place your body so that the wall is in contact with the back of your shoulder. Pull your arms backwards while keeping them in-line with your body.
Perform each exercise with 10 to 15 second intervals and 2 sets of each. Perform each workout 1-2 times daily.;

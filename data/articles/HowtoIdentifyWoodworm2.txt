 If you are having difficulty identifying active woodworm in your home (as opposed to other damage to the wood, or damage from woodworm that is not longer active) look online for exterminators in your area. Read reviews online and ask friends or colleagues if they have recommendations for local extermination companies. Call different companies for quotes and assessments before booking an appointment.
 Identifying specific species' of woodworm is incredibly difficult, and can result in misguided treatment attempts that fall through. Ask an exterminator for a professional assessment of your problem. Inquire about pricing and potential treatments before agreeing to any services by the company.Treatments could range from water based treatments for less severe infestations to fogging â€“ a treatment for floors that generally does not require furniture and carpets to be removed., Once an exterminator has identified woodworm in your home, consider having them treat the problem right away. Over time, woodworm can cause significant damage to wood as well as serious structural problems in a building. DIY measures can be ineffective and time-wasting if infested wood has been left untreated for too long, so be proactive about stopping the problem before it gets out of hand.

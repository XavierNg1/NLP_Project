 This should be your top priority. Look for nearby buildings and cars. If none are available, look for any structure you can huddle under to protect from the wind and snow. Stay there until the storm passes or help arrives.



Build a snow shelter if you can't find cover and are in an area unlikely to be found by rescuers, such as in the wilderness. If you're in a more populous area, a snow shelter is not advised, as it will make it much harder for rescuers to find you., If you have a cell phone with you, try calling both your city's emergency number and any loved ones who may be able to help. If cell towers are down, turn your phone off to conserve power and try again later. Periodically shout for help in case someone is nearby who can assist you.
 Staying hydrated will help to prevent hypothermia. If you have a water bottle with you, drink from it. However, do not eat snow, as this will drop your body temperature. Find a means of melting it first.
 Clap your hands, wave your arms, kick your legs. This will keep your heart rate up and keep the blood circulating in your extremities. Good circulation will help to prevent frostbite.

 Have one less chair than you have guests. Have each guest sit in a chair except for one. Once everyone is settled you can begin the game!

, Everybody then stands up and runs for a different chair. It cannot be a chair directly beside theirs. Once everyone is settled, the person left standing continues with another comment such as "I am grateful for those who have a dog." If you want to relate it to Easter, tell the children to say what they are grateful for about Easter, such as "I am grateful for Easter eggs", or "I am grateful that Jesus has risen", etc.
 This goes on until everyone is tired of a game but be warned â€“ it's addicting, so it may last for a while!


Note that this can be played competitively: while everyone is running for a chair, remove one chair. The one left without a seat is out, and the last one to remain wins a prize. This can be slightly injury-prone, since someone will no doubt be running for the chair you're removing!

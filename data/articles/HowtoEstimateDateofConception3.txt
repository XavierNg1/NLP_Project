 A doctor can determine the baby’s gestational age with an ultrasound by measuring the either the fetus' gestational sac, or the embryo or fetus, depending on stage of the pregnancy. Gestational age, considered the age of the baby, is determined based on the last menstrual cycle rather than conception. Subtracting two weeks from the gestational age will therefore give you a likely time of conception.Gestational age (the age of the baby) can be measured by ultrasound as early as five or six weeks after your last menstrual cycle, and is easier to estimate between weeks eight and 18, since most babies grow at the same rate during this time.Your doctor takes measurements to determine how old the baby is based on size.
Estimating conception with the help of ultrasound is not foolproof. If you know the date of your last cycle and the gestational date determined by ultrasound is less than a week different, doctors still use your cycle date to predict when the baby will be born.
An embryo may develop a heartbeat as early as six weeks after fertilization and the heart is formed by week eight. During the second month of pregnancy, symptoms such as breast tenderness, nausea and vomiting, heartburn, and frequent urination begin. See a doctor as soon as possible if you notice one or more of these symptoms to best estimate your date of conception with an ultrasound., If you do not know when your cycle started and don’t have access to or can’t get an ultrasound, a doctor can determine length of pregnancy around the 12th week by detecting if the uterus has grown over the pubic bone.This is the least reliable method and is only used to determine gestational age if the other two aren’t available.

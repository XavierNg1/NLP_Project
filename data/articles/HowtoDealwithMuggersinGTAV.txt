 When another player calls a mugger on you, expect a non-playable character (NPC) to run towards you, knock you over and steal your money. Any other NPC in the game will not suddenly run towards you like this. This makes the mugger noticeable.


If you are in a vehicle, the mugger will pull you out of the vehicle and drive off in it. This applies to planes as well!
Depending on your level, the mugger can steal up to $10,000 if you have it on hand.;
, If you are caught off guard and the mugger is able to rob you, quickly get up off the ground and chase down the mugger. If the mugger steals your vehicle, you will need to quickly take it back before he has time to drive off.
 Once the mugger has stolen your money and taken your vehicle, he will attempt to get away. If you are not quick enough, he can be gone in seconds. If you aren’t able to get your vehicle back, you will have to steal another to catch up to the mugger.


Shooting the mugger’s tires or blocking his path with another vehicle are both great ways to stop the mugger in his tracks.
 Once you have killed the mugger, simply walk up to him and gather what money he has stolen.


You need to kill the mugger in order to get your money back. If he is able to get away, you will not be able to get it back.

 Mix a little bit of tempera paint powder into the hot water, tablespoon of olive oil and add it a little bit at a time to the dry mix, until it forms a sticky dough. The consistency should be similar to clay.


If you’d rather not go through the work of dividing the dough into multiple bowls for coloring, you can make this recipe with plain water, without the tempera powder, and allow your child to color the beads by hand once they’re dry, using ready-made paint.;
, Make sure to make the hole is big enough for yarn or string to pass through.
 Depending on the weather, this can take up to a week, so you might also like to clear space on a sunny windowsill for nights and less sunny days.
 Cut a piece of yarn into the appropriate length for your child’s necklace or bracelet, wrap a piece of masking tape around one end to make stringing easier, knot the other end, and set them to work!

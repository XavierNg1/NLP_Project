 Scoring an open frame on the score card is simply adding the number of pins the player knocked down on their first roll with the number of pins knocked down on the second roll. This is the total for the frame.


In bowling, a running total is kept. The current score of each player is added and placed in the box designated for each frame. For example, if a player knocks down 3 pins on their first roll and 2 pins on their second, a 5 is placed in the box for frame 1. If a player knocks down a total of 7 pins in the second frame, a 12 is placed in the box for frame 2.
 If a player spares, the number of pins the player knocked down on the first roll is listed in the first box, and a slash is placed in the second box.


A spare is worth 10 pins plus the number of pins the player knocks down on the next roll. For example, if a player gets a spare in the first frame and then knocks down 7 pins on the first roll of the second frame, list a 17 in frame 1.
 If a player gets a strike, record an X in the box for the first roll.


When scoring a strike, the strike is worth 10 pins plus the number of pins the player knocks down on the next 2 rolls. For example, if a player gets a strike in frame 1, then knocks down 5 pins on the first roll in frame 2 and 4 pins on the second roll, list a 19 in frame 1.
If the player bowls a strike and follows with another strike, the player still adds in the next roll. Therefore, if a player gets a strike in frames 1, 2 and 3, the total for the first frame would be 30.
 Sometimes it gets a little messy. Let's do some concept-checking: if you bowl a strike in the first frame, a split (7|/) in the second frame, and a 9 in the third, what's the final score?


Did you come up with 48? The first frame is 20 (the strike plus the spare is 10+10), the second frame is 39 (20+10+9), and the third frame is 48 (39+9).

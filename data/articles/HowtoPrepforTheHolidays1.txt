 Send people who have recently moved emails in September and October. Once you have everyone updated, print out your mailing labels for holiday envelopes.


Consult your word processing or spreadsheet help menus to find out how to print mailing labels from a database. You can find white adhesive labels at most office stores and print the labels quickly, in a single document.;
, By approximately September, most families are aware of the changes that they would like to communicate in a letter or card. Write it early and update it quickly in November or December.

 The following maintenance tasks can help you to run your household more smoothly during the holidays:


Clean vacuum filters and order replacement bags. If your vacuum is due for a tune up or maintenance, do this at least a month before the holiday season.
Remove the filter and drain from your dishwasher. Clean the drain. Do a clean cycle while it is empty with some white vinegar to remove minerals.
Take your knives to be sharpened or sharpen them yourself. Your knives will be in high demand, so do this a few weeks before holiday season officially starts to ensure they are sharp enough for all your holiday cooking and carving.
Check your smoke alarms and the expiration date on your fire extinguisher. Most accidents occur in the home, so make sure you always have an extinguisher on hand. Replace smoke alarm and carbon monoxide detector batteries at regular intervals, such as right before the busy holiday season.
Deep clean your microwave and refrigerator. Throw away anything that is past its expiration to make room for holiday food. Save the oven cleaning until after the holidays, because a self-cleaning feature can be tough on the oven and you'll have to do it in January anyway.

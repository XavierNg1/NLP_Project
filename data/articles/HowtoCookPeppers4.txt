 Pour 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water into a large skillet with high sides. Heat this over medium-high on the stove. After the water begins to boil, add about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt.


The salt helps to draw out the flavor of the pepper, but adding the salt before the water boils will increase the amount of time you have to wait before the water reaches a steady boil.
 If working with small hot peppers, cut them into rings. For larger bell peppers, cut them into rings or strips.


Keep in mind that larger pieces will take longer to cook than smaller pieces. No matter what size you use, you should at least try to keep the pieces consistent in size.
 Place the peppers in the boiling water and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they feel crisp-tender.


The peppers will ideally still have a little “crunch” to them, but the flesh should be notably softer than when the peppers were raw.
 You can enjoy the peppers on their own or you could add them to any recipe calling for pre-cooked peppers.

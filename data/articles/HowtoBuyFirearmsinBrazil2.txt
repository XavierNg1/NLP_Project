 Most gun shops will allow you to tap and hold the guns before buying them.


Pistols (pistols) are great for self-defense. On the other hand, they require a lot of practice and skill to become proficient. They are not good for hunting (if you are hunting something bigger than rabbits). The efficacy drops sharply after 20–30 meters (65.6–98.4 ft), but can be used in well-trained hands 100 meters (328.1 ft), which is the only firearm, which still can be very effective in regard distances.






Rifles can fill many different needs. Hunting (became illegal after the year 2003), target shooting (with an extension: up to 1,000 meters). Bolt action rifles can be cheap, but very accurate. Semi-automatic rifles can be good for the target and home defense use. Automatic rifles can not be bought in Brazil without special permits (authorized by the army).






Shotguns are arguably the most versatile weapon.

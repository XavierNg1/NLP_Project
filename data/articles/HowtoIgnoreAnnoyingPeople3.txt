 Sometimes, you may not even realize how angry or frustrated you are. You may just find that you're extra stressed. Take a moment to actually notice your annoyance, so you can do something about it or at least move on with what you're doing., One of the best ways to ignore someone is to simply not engage. Don't talk to the person or engage in any nonverbal way. You can start out by saying that you won't be talking to him or her and then commence with not talking to the person., That is, don't answer phone calls or respond to any kind of text-based communications. To truly ignore someone, you must stop all lines of communication., If the person is merely bugging you, this step may not be necessary. However, if the person is also criticizing you or getting to you emotionally, you may need to find a way to step back from the person emotionally. In other words, try thinking about placing some kind of mental shield between you and the person. The person may say something negative, but you won't let it reach you. You're not going to take that into yourself.In other words, you hear what's being said, but you reject it's ability to hurt you.
 Ignoring someone is basically a form of the silent treatment. When it comes to close relationships, you shouldn't employ this tactic very often. In fact, it can be considered a type of emotional abuse. You are trying to punish the person by not acknowledging him or her instead of trying to work out the issue.Of course, ignoring your whining child or your little brother for five minutes so you can finish cooking dinner is not the same as intentionally employing the silent treatment against your spouse for a day or longer.

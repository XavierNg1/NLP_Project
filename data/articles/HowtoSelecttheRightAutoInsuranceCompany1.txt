, When checking for an auto insurance company, pay attention to its complaint ratio. Check your state's Department of Insurance website, where the customer complaint ratio of each company is listed.This shows the number of complaints received by the company versus the number of complaints settled by them. Higher ratios mean an unreliable company.
 Gage the level of customer service available by meeting with or calling customer service representatives. Check to see that they are friendly, prompt, and informed. Ask the hard questions, and make sure they are able to answer you. If a company is slow to answer and if the representatives don't answer your questions, move on.

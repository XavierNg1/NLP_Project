 In a small mixing bowl, combine two parts baking soda with one part vegetable oil. With your clean fingers or a kitchen utensil, mix the soda and oil until it forms a thick, well blended paste. Make enough paste to lightly coat all greasy surfaces of your cabinets.As an example, if you plan on using 2 tbsp (30 ml) of oil, you’d need to use 4 tbsp (59 ml) of baking soda.
Alternatively, you could substitute mineral oil in place of vegetable oil. Use the same amount of mineral oil as you would vegetable oil.Test this paste on an out of sight spot on your cabinets. Some finishes may react negatively to baking soda’s mild abrasive properties.
 The cleaning paste should be quite thick. While cleaning your cabinets, it’s likely that some of this paste will fall onto the area beneath them, along with absorbed grease and grime. Lay out a cover, like newspaper, a drop cloth, or an old towel, under your cabinets to catch falling paste., Scoop up a small amount of the paste with your fingers. Gently rub the paste onto all dirty surfaces of the cabinet in a thin coat. Pay close attention to handles, where grease and buildup collect naturally., Use a non-abrasive sponge or soft, lint-free dishcloth to lightly scrub the paste on your cabinets. Work it into nooks, crannies, and cracks in the grain. For narrow spaces or detail cleaning, use a toothbrush., Cleanse your sponge or dishcloth by rinsing it in clean water. When clean, wring it out so it is damp. Wipe away any paste still on your cabinets with the sponge or cloth. Dry the surface of the cabinets with a soft, lint-free drying cloth.If any grease remains, spot clean it with leftover paste in the fashion described. When your cabinets are clean, remaining paste can be thrown away.

 Liquid hand soap is gentle enough to be used on satin shoes. Apply a pea-sized drop of liquid hand soap to a damp cloth., Once you apply hand soap to the damp towel, create a lather by rubbing. Try rubbing two sides of the cloth against each other to create a lather., Starting at the top of the shoes, gently dab all the stains with the damp, soapy cloth. Do not rub the soapy cloth on the stains, as this can discolor the shoe., After dabbing the soap on the stain, immediately rinse the area by using a separate, dampened cloth. Then take a soft, dry cloth and blot the wet spot until you remove as much moisture as possible., You should only use cool or cold to clean tough stains from satin shoes. Hot water can discolor the shoes. Using hot water on the shoes could cause the fabric to shrink considerably, potentially altering the fit of the shoes.

The handle that holds the coffee is called the group handle and this should be locked into the machine. The light on the machine will go out when the water is at the correct temperature.

For a single shot of espresso you will need one spoonful of coffee (7 grams / .25 oz), and for a double shot you will need 2 spoonfuls (14 grams / .5 oz). Put the correct amount in the filter basket and tap it to create a level surface. Use the tamper provided to compact the coffee. This will ensure the water doesn't flow through it too quickly.
 Lock the group handle into the machine and put the cup underneath. Turn on the dosage button. The coffee should take 14-18 seconds to filter through for a single espresso and 20-25 seconds for a double, after which you should turn off the dosage button. If it is filtering through too quickly, add a bit more coffee and compact it more firmly. If you are grinding your own coffee beans, grind them more finely.
 You may want to add milk to the coffee. Prepare the milk depending on whether you're making a cappuccino, latte or mocha.

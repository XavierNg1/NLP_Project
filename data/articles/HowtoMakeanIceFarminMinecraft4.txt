 On the computer, you can do this by pressing the number corresponding to your tool in your hotbar, which can be located on the bottom of your screen, or using the mouse scroll button to select your tool. On the Xbox, you can select it by pressing the right and left bumper buttons, then placing it by pressing the left trigger button.


If your tool is missing from the hotbar, press the inventory button to access your inventory, select the tool, and then place it on your hotbar. If your hotbar is full, click on the item you want to replace, place it in an empty slot in your inventory, and finally place your tool on the free slot on the hotbar.
 Ice resembles translucent pale-blue solid blocks and can be quite slippery when moving across it. The exposed areas of your pool must be fully frozen to take advantage of your farm. If only one or two blocks are frozen, depending on the size of your pool, it isn’t really worth it. So it’s best to wait for a while before picking a random block of Ice to gather.
 Once gathered, you can now use your ice to create different things, from skating rinks to traps to an igloo! Remember, once you place the ice, you’ll need the tool to gather it up again or else it will break. But even if you accidentally break the ice, your farm would ensure a steady supply of the material for as long as you play!

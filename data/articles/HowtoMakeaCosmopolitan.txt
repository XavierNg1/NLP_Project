 Fill the martini glass with ice and leave to cool while you prepare your drink.






;
, In a mixing glass, combine the vodka, orange liqueur, and cranberry juice.









You can use single shot and double shot measures if you're making several drinks at once.
 Cut a lime in half, and divide one half into four wedges.
 Squeeze two wedges over the mixing glass, and drop them in.
 Fill up the mixing glass with fresh ice. Always do this last so you don't dilute your cocktail with melted water from the ice.
 Put the top half of the cocktail shaker on, pressing down firmly. Shown here is a Cobbler shaker. Hold the top and bottom with each hand and shake vigorously for about 20 seconds or when there is condensation on the outside of the shaker and it feels very cold.









If using a Boston Shaker (a metal bottom and a glass or plastic mixing glass), the cooling process during shaking will cause the metal to contract on the glass and form the seal. Invert so that the glass cup is on the top to prevent it from hitting and breaking on an object as well as prevent the ingredients from leaking out of the shaker.
 Remove the ice from your chilled glass. Put the cocktail strainer over the shaker and pour in to the martini glass.









When you put the strainer on the shaker, be sure to push it towards the edge of the glass that the mixture is going to pour over so you don't get any shards of ice in your drink.
 To garnish, use an orange or lemon twist (see Tips). Alternatively, you can use a wedge of lemon or lime.

, If you are still living in a house with your mum and want a game system with good sound, and lots of ways to socialize, and tons of great games and a movie Blu ray player and a special TV to see 3d and to be able to see only your screen on split screen then get the ps3. It is also good to get the PS vita, an amazing system that lets you play AR, motion control, and other neat features. Though the 3ds is a good system as well, and can still play AR, and other internet things.
 I know Soap MacTarvish can!) then get the wii. there are TONS of great games on their, like new super Mario brothers Wii or Mario party 9! and even virtual console for you retro gamers out there.
 You gamers are calling Microsoft n00bz because they make you pay monthly to be able to play Xbox live, but there are also amazing game franchisees such as Halo, Gears of War, and the kinect, which requires no controller, because YOU are the controller when you are using the kinect, because you can manipulate the menus, fight baddies, work out, and for you space geeks all interested in star wars and how the Jedi can manipulate all their computers without touching anything or just like the crazy crap they get into, there is even a kinect game for it!

, Though there are lots of gamer computers for you hardcore gamers looking to drive a car with a pimped up Logitech wheel, or shoot out of an airplane in style with a pimped up.... okay you get the idea.

 Most washing machines have three or four temperature settings: hot, warm, cool, and cold. White and off-white clothing can be washed on a hot setting. This hot setting helps to remove germs from the clothing.


The warm setting is great for darks and permanent press clothing. It helps reduce color bleeding in the wash.
Try to use the cold water setting for delicate items.
Keep in mind that cool and cold water can be used in the rinse cycle for almost every load of laundry.
 There are some detergents that are made just for children. They clean clothes well and are designed not to irritate a child’s sensitive skin when they next wear the article of clothing. However, if you would prefer not to buy an entirely separate detergent for your child, choose a detergent that will work well for your toddler’s skin and the rest of the family’s clothes.


Some children have delicate and sensitive skin; pick a detergent that is made for sensitive skin. Many children (and adults) have allergies and are not able to use anything that has a scent; decide if using scented or unscented is best for the family.
 Read the tag again to determine the best way to dry certain articles of clothing. You might find that a tag says to air dry or line dry the item. This means that the clothes have to be put somewhere so that they can dry without having extra heat added to them. You may also choose to line dry your toddler’s clothes if you are afraid that the clothing will shrink in the dryer.


Toddler clothing tags often say to tumble dry on low or medium heat. Put these clothes in the dryer.
 If you are putting clothing into the dryer, consider adding dryer sheets. Dryer sheets help to remove some of the static electricity that builds up when the fabrics rub together in the dryer.


Consider whether or not your child’s skin will react badly to the dryer sheet. If your child doesn’t have allergies or sensitive skin, you should be fine adding dryer sheets to your laundry.

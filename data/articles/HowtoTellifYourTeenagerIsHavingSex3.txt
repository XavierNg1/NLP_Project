 The best way to stay actively involved in your teenager's life is to keep the lines of communication open. Although teens are notorious for being hard to talk to, you should still make the effort. Knowing that you are available and willing to talk can make it easier for your teen to talk to about sex and for you to tell if they’re having sex.


Talk about everyday things like social issues, their day, their friends, and anything else that they’ll discuss.
You should also talk about serious issues such as drugs, alcohol, and sex on a regular basis so that you’re both comfortable talking about it.
 Teenagers generally have friends and partners that reflect their morals and values, and have similar opinions. Getting to know the people in your teen's life can help you learn a great deal about their sexual activity. The more you know about the people your teenager chooses to have in their life, the more you will be able to tell about your teen and the types of things they might be doing, including sex. For example, if most of your teen daughter’s friends seem very into dating, romance, and intimacy, it’s likely your daughter is also.
Encourage your teenager to invite their friends over. You don’t have to stay in the room with them the whole time, but just them being there can give you a sense of them.
 When you show an interest in the things they enjoy and participate in, it lets your teen know that you care. This is one way to build a strong bond with your teenager so that you’ll both feel comfortable talking about sex.Ask your teen what their interests and hobbies are if you don’t already know.
Attend recitals, practices, games, etc. as much as you can.

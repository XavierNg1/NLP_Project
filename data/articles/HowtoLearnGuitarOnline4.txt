 Again, finding the website you want to use is half the battle. Your favorite search engine will come in handy again, though music theory is a bit more touchy than scales. Make sure that you are at a reputable site, as amateur music theory can set you on the wrong track and cause problems in your knowledge that take a long time to correct.


There are plenty of great free resources out there; if a site wants you to pay, make sure it's not knowledge you could get elsewhere.
 If you think learning an instrument is overwhelming, try learning music theory. The entirety of music theory would take a lifetime to master. However, there are some fundamentals that everyone should know.


Learn chord progressions. A chord progression is any sequence of chords, and some sound better than others. For instance, the chords G-C-D sound pretty great together on guitar. Learning chord progressions will explain to you why those sound good together.
Rhythm and time signatures are also good topics to get started with. Basically, you're trying to learn why certain music sounds good, and then applying that knowledge to producing your own good music. Theory often gets ignored by people who just want to learn a few songs, but if you ever want to make music then you should have at least a basic understanding of theory.

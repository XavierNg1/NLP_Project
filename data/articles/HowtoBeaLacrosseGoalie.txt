 Equipment is necessary in this position. (see Things You'll Need);
, You'll want to stand about a step away from the front to cut off the angle but also have enough time to react. Your dominant hand should be gripping the neck of the stick while your non dominant hand should be a forearm's length away from the top hand, a little higher than the middle of the stick.
 Make sure you're stepping forward at a 45 degree angle, leading with the foot that's on the same side (aka ball comes from right side, step w/ right foot). Center shots, step with whichever foot you prefer.
,,, Slide both hands down, with the non dominant gripping the end of the stick and the dominant a couple inches above it.
 Push with your top arm and pull with the bottom arm, following through to the other side of your body. Don't be afraid of the ball.
, If the ball is on the other side of the field, come out of the crease to yell at your defense so that when the ball comes back, they know what to do.

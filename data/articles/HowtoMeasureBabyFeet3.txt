 Different foot measuring gauges may require slightly different procedures for measuring, so start by reading the manufacturer’s directions.
 Have your baby sit in someone else’s lap or in a comfortable chair, with his or her knees bent at a 90-degree angle.
 Make sure your child’s heel sits against the gauge’s heel rest. Check that the gauge is parallel to the floor and that your baby’s ankles are at a 90-degree angle as well.
 Move the toe slide until it touches the tip of your baby’s big toe. Take note of the length measurement shown in the circular window, indicated by the black lines on its sides. Add any extra millimeters in the side panel.


For best results, make sure that your baby’s toes aren’t bent. Gently press them down against the gauge with your thumb as you measure.
 Use the width tape to measure. It should be placed automatically at the correct part of the foot. Don’t pull too much; if you do, you may wind up with a tight measurement. Note the width. , If you live in U.K. or E.U., simply go to the Clark size calculator online (at http://www.clarks.co.uk/sizecalculator) and enter your data. The site will tell you the correct shoe size to purchase.


If you live in the U.S., convert your measurements to inches, then consult a children’s shoe size chart (such as http://www.healthyfeetstore.com/kids-shoe-sizing-guide-with-sizing-chart.html) for American measurements.

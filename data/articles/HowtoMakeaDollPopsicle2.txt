 This might be a flat toothpick for a Barbie doll, or for bigger dolls, use a craft stick or a skinny stick. Cut to the length you think will be realistic for your doll to be holding (be sure to account for the paper being added to the stick too).


If there are sharp edges after cutting the stick, file off using a nail file.
 This should be about three quarters the length of the stick and a reasonable width in comparison to the size of the doll holding such a treat. This forms the base of the popsicle or ice lolly.
 Use a realistic color, one that would match a popsicle or ice lolly.
 Cut off any excess, then glue firmly onto the foam piece. Allow to dry.
 Keep the glued side of the paper facing onto the stick.
 This will protect the paper during play.
 Once the item has fully dried, it can be used with your doll.

 A regular piece of paper will do just fine, or construction paper, printer paper, wrapping paper, etc. The flimsier the paper, the more likely the paper people chain will rip.


The number of people in the paper chain depends on the length of the paper: the longer the paper, the more people.
 Make sure that the width of the folds are the size of the outline of the person you are going to draw.



Take care that the head touches the top edge and the feet touch the bottom edge of the strip. Also, the hands must touch either side.
Tracing the outline of the person will be a lot easier than doing it freehand. (Do an online search for "gingerbread man", go to images, and there should be a plain outline that you can print off and trace over.)

, Cut out the shape of the person, leaving the folds intact at the hands (and possibly the feet also) so that the chain does not break.
 You now have a chain of people. Pull it apart and it's ready to be hung.

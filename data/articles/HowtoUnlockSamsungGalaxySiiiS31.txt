 If you meet your carrier's requirements, they will typically provide you your unlock code for free. Usually you will need to have your phone completely paid off, and to have been with the carrier for at least three months.


Carriers may be more likely to unlock your phone if you explain to them that you are traveling abroad soon, and need to buy a SIM card at your destination for local service.
If your provider does not supply the code, try one of the other methods in this guide.;
, After receiving your unlock code, power down your S3 and remove your old SIM card. Insert the SIM card from the new network.
 When the S3 tries to connect to the new network, you will be prompted for the unlock code.
 Make sure that you enter the code exactly. If you enter the code wrong too many times, the phone will lock and you will need to get the carrier to unlock it for you. Once the code has been entered correctly, you will connect to your new network.

 You often see, around your town, star shaped holes. Use your spade, (purchased for 500 bells) to dig these up. There will be an item under these holes, sometimes a fossil or a gyroid. If you find you have dug up a fossil, go to your local museum, (found in plaza) and talk to Blathers. Tell him you want him to 'Asses a fossil'. He will ask if you would consider donating it. When this event occurs, tell him no. Nothings better than telling an owl no, right?


Once you've got the fossil assessed, sell it at the Re-tail. Do not sell it at Timmy and Tommy's shop, as they will give you a lower price. If you have more than one fossil to sell, do not sell them together as you will get a lower price for sure. If you get a gyroid, sell it at the Re-tail. They usually sell for 850 bells.;
, If you have unlocked Tortimer's island, go there at night, (8:00pm or later) and catch some bugs. Catch the bugs on the palm trees, not the regular or mango trees. If it helps, cut down the regular/mango trees with an axe. You can borrow one from Lloyd, the gyroid. Some of the bugs on the palm trees can be worth up to 12500 bells EACH. And by the way, if you don't want to sit around waiting til 8:00pm, you can always change the time in your settings.
 If you have unlocked Tortimer's island, go there. It doesn't matter what time. Fish will be worth more if they are not from your town. If you want even MORE bells for a fish, try going for a shark? Oh, and if you find a Horse Mackerel, do yourself a favor and throw it back in the sea. They are practically worthless!

 Quinoa is the seed of a broadleaf plant, so while not botanically a cereal grain, it is treated as a grain in culinary applications. Quinoa, along with the soybean, is one of the few plants to contain a complete protein. You can substitute about a fourth of the flour in a yeast bread recipe for quinoa to increase the protein content. In a quick bread, such as a muffin or biscuit, you can substitute nearly all of the flour for quinoa, noting that the bread will be more brittle and crumbly as more quinoa is added.;
, Soy flour can be used much like quinoa flour; it contains a complete protein and has a higher overall protein content than barley or wheat. Soy flour can be substituted for about a third of the recipe's flour.


Because neither soy nor quinoa contains gluten, yeast bread cannot be made with a large proportion of these flours. Gluten provides the elasticity that allows the bread to rise and entrap the carbon dioxide created by the yeast.
Powdered soy milk can be used instead of soy flour.
 Nuts, seeds, and beans are all high in protein, and can be easily added to a bread recipe. These ingredients can be bought in flour form, or they can be crushed and added directly to the bread dough.


Organic grocery stores and specialty food stores will stock common flour varieties like garbanzo bean flour and almond flour. These can be substituted for a recipe's flour content in small proportions.
Adding sesame seeds or poppy seeds will increase protein while adding a mild flavor. Caraway seeds add protein and are immensely popular in rye bread recipes.
 Many traditional bread recipes, such as brioche and challah, incorporate eggs into their dough. The result is a rich, almost custard-like texture and a yellow color. Adding eggs also increases the amount of protein in a bread recipe.

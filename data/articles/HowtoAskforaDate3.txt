 The stress of asking someone out can be too overwhelming for some people. In this case, asking someone out through a text or direct message may be easier. The downside is that they don't need to respond and technical issues could prevent them from seeing the message altogether.


In text you could write, "Hey. I'm going to see Spiderman this weekend. Would you want to come with me?"
If they don't respond, don't obsess over it. Wait a couple of hours before sending them a follow-up text.
 If you don't have the person's contact information or are unable to ask them yourself, it's possible that you could get a mutual friend to ask for you. Contact your friend and tell them that you'd want to go on a date with the person. Tell your friend where you'd like to meet up and at what time and they can convey the message to the person that you like.


You can say something like, "Hey, I really like Mark, but I'm too nervous to ask him out. Do you think you could ask if he'd meet up after school for me?"
Sometimes if you let a friend know that you like someone, the person that you like will reach out to you themselves if they feel the same way.
 There are a couple of methods that you can employ that will make asking the person you know out much easier. One of these is through framing the question as a suggestion.For example, you can ask, "What are you doing this weekend?" If they say "Not sure" you can say something like "I was going to go to the movies. Would you want to come since you're not doing anything?"


You can also frame the question like it was their idea. For example, you can ask "What's the best Mexican restaurant around here?" If they respond, "La Tacerquio," you can say, "Sounds good. Do you want to go with me on Thursday for lunch?"

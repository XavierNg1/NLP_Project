 A classic ponytail is a classy and simple look that depends on untangled and knot-free hair. Before you begin styling your hair in the ponytail, first brush your hair, brushing down from the tips, then working your way up, still brushing down through your hair. Once your hair is smooth and tangle-free, run your brush from the hair at the top of your forehead back to sweep your hair back away from your face.








Try to use a nylon and boar bristle paddle brush, which is the best type of brush for eliminating frizz. If you have curly or frizzy hair and don’t normally brush your hair when it’s dry, use your fingers to comb through your hair and eliminate knots or tangles.
This look works best for long to medium length hair. It can be a sleek look if you have straight smooth hair, or a textured hairstyle with a lot of volume if you have curly hair.
 Start brushing your hair into a ponytail, using your dominant hand to brush your hair back and your non-dominant hand to gather your hair into the ponytail. Look in the mirror as you are doing this and brush any bumps that may form.








Aim to make your ponytail slightly higher than the middle of your head.
Use your fingers to rake your hair back if you don’t usually brush your hair.
 Once you finish brushing your hair back, secure your hair with a hair elastic, making sure that there are no bumps on the top or sides of your head.








If there are bumps, try to brush them down, or remove the hair elastic, brush the bumps, and then re-apply the hair elastic.
 To give this ponytail a sophisticated touch, take a strand of hair about the width of a finger from the underside of your ponytail and wrap it around the hair elastic to hide it.








If you don’t mind the hair elastic showing, you can skip this step.
 Once you have wrapped the strand of hair around the hair elastic, pin it in place either directly above or below the base of the ponytail to keep it in place.

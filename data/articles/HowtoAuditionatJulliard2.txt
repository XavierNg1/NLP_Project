 Julliard is a huge step for you, you don't want to show up on stage and not have everything you need. Things you need to bring when your auditioning for musical instruments is:
<br

Rosin ( string instruments )
Reeds ( wind instruments )
Headshot ( some auditions require it )
Resume
Anything else that's required you can find more information on the Julliard website.
 In your little studio, you may have gotten the attention you wanted. You have to remember that if you make a small mistake you won't be heard over the 600 other students playing. You need to think about what happens when you get into Julliard. You can't expect everything be your way!

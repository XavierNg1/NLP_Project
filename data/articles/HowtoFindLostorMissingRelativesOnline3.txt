 Create an account with a missing persons database, such as NAMUS. NAMUS, also known as the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, is a United States government funded website that allows law enforcement professionals and the general public to add and track missing person cases. , Include basic details as well as photos and more specific information about the missing person. Provide as much information as possible that might help strangers identify the person you are looking for. Consider how they might look now as opposed to when they went missing. , NAMUS allows account holders to make and print missing persons posters. After you have created and printed some posters with information on your missing loved one, post and distribute these posters locally as well as in the areas where the person was last seen.
 Persistence is very important to finding lost or missing persons, so check your account daily and get involved in the websiteâ€™s forums to connect with others who are going through the same thing as you are.

 If you believe that your stalker is nonviolent and will back down with confrontation, you might try speaking to him directly.Telling the person who is stalking you that you are not interested in any kind of relationship with him might make him back off.


Consider having another person present to help protect you in case of escalation to violence and to act as a witness to the conversation.
Try not to be too nice with your rejection. Being nice to a stalker can unwittingly encourage him, and he may try to “read between the lines” and listen to your tone rather than your words.
 If you believe that your stalker is nonviolent and will back down with confrontation, be sure to tell him that a relationship will never happen. Saying that you’re not interested in a relationship “at this time” or “because you have a boyfriend right now” leaves the window open for future relationships and may not deter the stalker. Be clear that you do not—and you will never, under any circumstances—want a relationship.
 If you are frightened or angry, it can be difficult to have a conversation with your stalker.It is important to remain as calm as possible, avoid yelling or cussing, and be clear and direct. Anger may be misinterpreted as passion, just as sympathy or niceness may be misinterpreted as affection.
 It is best not to have this conversation alone. Ask someone for help, but you may want to be sure that any friend you bring with you to the conversation will not be perceived as a threat or competition. You may want to include a friend who is the same gender as you, as long as you both feel safe confronting the stalker.
 If you have experienced violence at the hands of the stalker, or if he has threatened you, you should not try to contact or talk to him on your own. Consult the police department or victim services about the best way to send a clear message to a violent stalker.

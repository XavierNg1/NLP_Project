 The 401(k) is a financial retirement plan offered by some employers. It’s basically a mutual fund – a series of stocks – that some portion of your income goes into automatically. If your workplace offers you a 401(k), you should contribute as much as possible, even if it takes a bit longer to pay down your debt. Identify how of your contribution your employer will match and invest up to that level.For instance, if your employer pitches in $1,000 per month, invest at least $1,000 into your 401(k).
 If you have multiple sources of debt – for instance, a school loan, car loan, and a personal loan – figure out which has the highest interest rate. Try to get it under control by either renegotiating the terms of the loan or by paying it off. That way, you’ll be in a better position to invest with greater freedom.To find out if your loan is eligible for a reduced interest rate or a consolidation (which might be available, for instance, if you have two loans from the same institution), contact your financial institution.

 Just because you’re investing doesn’t mean you should skip out on paying down your debt. You can think of your debt payments as a kind of investments, too. Over the long term, you’ll save money through lower interest payments, saving you money.Some debts may have a penalty for paying them off too early. Even if your loan has such a penalty, keep in mind that the penalty may still be cheaper than the total amount of interest paid on the whole loan.

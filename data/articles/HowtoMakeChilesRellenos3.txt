 Make it large enough that stuffing can be put in, but not so large that the chile pepper will fall apart. At this point, you can carefully scrape out the seeds with a butter knife to reduce the heat of the pepper, but this is optional.
 Be careful because the soft, roasted chiles are easily torn. Begin with the meat stuffing. Portion out some of the stuffing and fill the chile. When 10 of the chiles are filled, do the same to the remaining chiles with the cheese stuffing. Don't stuff them so much that the slit can't be closed.
 It doesn't need to be perfect; it's just to keep any stuffing from falling out while you fry them.
 Allow the oil to get hot but keep setting on low.

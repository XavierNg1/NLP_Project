 It is essential to have the person try on the article of clothing for a fitting to allow you to pin it to the correct length.;
, Place them about 3 inches (7.5 cm) apart all the way around the material. Turn it inward as you put in the pins.
 Take the item off carefully to avoid scraping pins on your model.
 Make sure that the thread matches the color of the material as closely as possible.
 This provides the strength needed for a hem; the hem takes a lot of punishment from daily wear. (To double the thread, put it through the needle and bring both ends together, tie them in a knot.)

, If the clothing is extremely long, measure and cut some of the excess material off, but leave about 2 inches (5 cm). Finish the raw edge of the fabric so that it does not fray. If you want to let the material out later, simply fold it over a few times, making an edge about two or three inches thick.
 Take up as little fabric as possible with the needle on each stitch. Try to place stitches about 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) apart. You can sew by hand or with a sewing machine, depending on which way suits you most.

, Place the chicken broth, oil, powdered milk, egg, and flour in a large mixing bowl. Use a spoon to stir the ingredients until they are thoroughly mixed.
 Use your hands to knead the dough until it becomes stiff and pliable. Turn it out onto a floured counter or work surface.
 Use a rolling pin to roll the dough to the thickness you desire. For larger dogs, keep the dough thick, about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm), and for smaller dogs, roll it thin, about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).
 Use a bone-shaped cookie cutter to cut the dough into bone shapes. Lay the bones on a greased cookie sheet.


Once you've cut as many bones as you can, gather the dough scraps and roll them into a ball, then use the rolling pin to flatten the dough again. Cut more dog bone shapes from the dough using the cookie cutter.
If you don't have a dog bone-shaped cookie cutter, use another fun shape for your dog's treats. Go for a holiday themed cutter, like a tree or a snowflake, or use a classic shape like a star or a circle.
 Place the cookie sheet in the oven and bake the cookies for 50 minutes. Check them periodically to make sure they don't burn.


If the cookies seem to be turning brown quickly, reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees.
If the cookies don't seem to be baking fast enough, increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees.
 They will be hard and crunchy, just the way dogs like them. Let the cookies cool and store them in an air-tight container.

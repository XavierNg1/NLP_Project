 Use your fingers or a soft paper towel to spread the oil over the entire inner surface of the pan, including the bottom and sides.


While Orgreenic recommends the use of vegetable oil, other oils and vegetable shortening could be used, instead. If selecting another oil, opt for one with a high smoking point, like peanut oil, grapeseed oil, or canola oil, over one with a low smoking point, like olive oil.
This technique can be used on all Orgreenic pans, including all stovetop pans, oven pans, and grill pans.;
, Place the pan on the eye of your stove and turn the heat onto a medium setting. Keep the pan on the heat until you can see smoke rise from its surface.


Expect this process to take several minutes. While you might be tempted to heat the oil on high heat, you need to keep the temperature control set to medium so that the oil heats up slowly. Otherwise, the oil may not seep into the surface thoroughly enough.
Every few minutes, turn the pan to redistribute any oil that has begun to puddle or bead.
 Remove the pan from the heat source. Set it aside and allow it to cool back down to room temperature.


Leave the pan out at room temperature as it cools. Do not attempt to cool it down faster by placing it in a refrigerated space, since the dramatic change in temperature can damage the ceramic.
 Use a clean paper towel to wipe away any visible puddles or streaks of remaining oil.


The surface of the pan will still feel a little greasy after you wipe it down, but this greasiness is natural and should not be scrubbed out.
 Your Orgreenic pan should be re-seasoned every six months. You can do so following this same method or by trying one of the other described methods.


If food begins sticking to the surface of your pan before six months have elapsed, re-season your pan ahead of schedule.

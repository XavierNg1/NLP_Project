 Preheat the grill as usual, leaving one section open for indirect heating.


Both charcoal and gas grills can be used for this. Indoor electric grills will work, too.
Since toasting the buns will take a very short amount of time, it's best to use this method only when you are already using the grill to cook something else, such as hamburgers or hotdogs. If you have not yet set up an area of the grill for indirect heat, wait until the rest of your food is done, then turn off one of the burners or push aside some of the hot coals. Allow the newly emptied area to cool for several minutes before toasting the buns there.
This method can be used for all bun styles: standard sandwich buns, sub sandwich buns, and hotdog buns.
 Split open the bun and lightly paint both cut sides with melted butter.


Coat the cut sides of the bun thoroughly, spreading the butter all the way to the edges. Dry ends will likely burn.
You do not need to paint the butter over the crust side.
 Place the bun halves directly on top of the grill grate, keeping both cut sides face-down. Carefully grill the halves until the cut surfaces turn light golden brown.Make sure that you place the bun halves over the indirect heat. Sitting them over direct heat will increase the likelihood of burning them.
Check the progress after roughly 10 seconds. You can return the bun to the grill if it needs more time, but buns tend to brown quickly, so you need to work in small intervals to prevent them from burning.
You do not need to turn the bun halves while grilling them since only the cut sides need to become toasted.
 Remove the bun halves from the grill and use them while they're still hot and crispy.

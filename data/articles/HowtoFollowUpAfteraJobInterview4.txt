 Being over-eager and bombarding the company with follow-up emails and phone calls is not a good idea and can actually harm your chances of getting the position. Follow the three-strike rule - one thank you note, a lengthy thank you letter, and a follow-up email or phone call to find out whether a decision has been made. If you get no response from any of these three, you are better off quitting while you're ahead and moving on with the job search.Whatever you do, don't fill up your interviewers inbox with daily emails or leave long-winded messages or his or her voicemail, as this will definitely won't win you any favors.
 Showing up at the company uninvited is a definite no-no. It puts pressure on the hiring manager or interviewer to speak with you, even though the timing may be very inconvenient for them. It also puts them in a very awkward position if you didn't get the position and they are forced to tell you in person. Either way, it reflects badly on you and you should avoid at all costs. This advice also goes for delivering thank you notes in person - just don't do it., Some people erroneously think they should just wait for a decision and not bother the interviewer. This is not the correct tactic. Many companies deliberately wait before hiring to see who follows up after the interview in a professional manner, and who is really hungry for the position. As long as you abide by the three-strike rule, following-up is a positive and strategic move which may be instrumental in securing you a position with the company.

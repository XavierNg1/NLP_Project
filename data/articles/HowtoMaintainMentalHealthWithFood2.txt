 Eating carbohydrates like brown rice, whole wheat bread, whole grain pasta, quinoa, or oats can help lift mood by prompting your brain to release serotonin, a mood-boosting neurotransmitter.


Whole grains also contain selenium, which is associated with decreased symptoms of depression.
 Turkey and other animal proteins (including eggs) provide the amino acid tryptophan, which can help boost mood and reduce irritability. Tyrosine and other amino acids contained in these foods may help relieve stress, promote tranquility or restfulness, and interact with serotonin in the brain to improve feelings of contentment.
 Many neurological problems and some mental illnesses can be caused or aggravated by vitamin or mineral deficiencies. Vitamin B-12 supplementation is a requirement for vegans and vegetarians. Magnesium and vitamin B-12 can be particularly helpful in reducing symptoms of depression.
 Foods rich in calcium, vitamin D, whey protein, and a host of other nutrients can help reduce fatigue, repair cell damage, stabilize mood, and promote feelings of well-being.


Drink a glass of milk, have a cup of yogurt, or snack on some cheese everyday to get the benefits dairy can offer.

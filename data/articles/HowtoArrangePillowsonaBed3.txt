 Most pillow arrangements are two columns wide, and are designed to work best for a full or queen size bed. Any arrangement can be adapted for a king (or California king) size bed, by adding a third column of pillows.For minimalist arrangements, use six standard pillows (instead of four). Stack them (horizontally or vertically) in sets of two.
If you would like to use accent pillows, you have two choices. You can center one in front of the center stack of pillows, or use two pillows, placing one at each space between the standard pillow stacks.
For Euro arrangements, use three Euro pillows in place of two. Follow with three standard pillows.
Once again, you can always choose to use two accent pillows, or stick with one.
 Another option is to use two king size pillows instead of using three standard pillows. Two king size pillows should fill the width of your bed.For minimalist arrangements, use four king size pillows, stacking them (horizontally or vertically) in stacks of two.
For Euro arrangements, start with three Euro pillows and follow with two king size pillows.
 Working with a king size bed allows you to use more pillows without the arrangement becoming overly busy. Many common arrangements are 2-3 rows thick. When working with a king size bed, you can create arrangements with 3-4 rows.Some ideas include:


Three Euro pillows, three standard pillows, and three square accent pillows.
Three Euro pillows, two king size pillows, and three rectangular accent pillows.
Three Euro pillows, two king size pillows, two square accent pillows, and one rectangular accent pillow.

 Swallowtails love to fly up and down sunny roadsides. The best ones will be roads with creeks or rivers running alongside them. When you start seeing swallowtails, park and begin the hunt.;
, Male swallowtails love to "puddle" (drinking from wet ground), and are particularly fond of open, sunny expanses of wet gravel or sand on roads or alongside creeks. Large numbers may gather here, and the puddling butterflies are relatively easy to catch because they're just sitting on the ground.
 Thistles are a particular favorite, and swallowtails are easy to catch when they're nectaring. Other good flowers include verbena, valerian, lilac, and butterfly-bush, although swallowtails will nectar from many others if need be.
 Swallowtails like to fly up and down linear corridors -- roadsides, creeks, city streets, etc. -- while searching for mates. If you can't find any of them perched on the ground or on flowers, find a linear corridor that they're flying along, and station yourself along the corridor.
 A swallowtail flying along a roadside, streamside, or similar corridor usually doesn't turn around frequently. It'll keep going the same direction for long periods. Try to get ahead of it, and take your swing at it as it passes you.

 Look for the Facebook app on your mobile device and tap it.
 If you logged out of your previous Facebook session, you will be asked to log in again, so enter your registered email address and password into the fields, and tap “Log in” to access your account.


Skip this step if you’re still logged into Facebook upon launch.
 Tap on your name on the header toolbar. You will be brought to your Timeline, or wall. Tap on the Photos box, right below your cover photo. You will be brought to your Photos screen.
 The photos on the mobile app are organized by albums. Tap on the album where you want to add the photos to. The album will be opened, and the photos inside it will be displayed. Tap on the plus icon on the upper right corner of the album header bar to bring up your mobile media gallery.


If you want to upload the photos to a new album instead of an existing one, tap on the “Create Album” box at the upper left corner of the Photos screen.
 Tap on the photos you want to be uploaded at the same time. The photos will be highlighted.
 Tap on the “Done” button on the upper right corner of the media gallery view. A small “Update Status” window will appear with your selected photos. You can filter the audience of these photos here, and you can also add a description or a message with your post.


Tap the “Post” button on the upper right corner of the “Update Status” window to upload and post your photos. Your status update with your photos will be posted on your Timeline, or wall, and to the corresponding album where they were uploaded to.

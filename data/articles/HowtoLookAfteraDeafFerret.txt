 Deafness in ferrets is linked to the same genetic characteristic which makes some white cats deaf, also some white dogs and also humans who have a white flash of hair on their heads.;
, If the ferret fails to respond to your voice or any sounds made close to its ears, then it is probably deaf. Your vet should also be able to confirm the ferret's deafness.
 You can help your ferret grow to love you and feel comfortable around you, with the right care.
, Since the ferret cannot hear you, if you approach it from the back to pick it up, it will twist around and bite out of fear. That is its only form of self-defence. Instead, always approach your deaf ferret from the front.
 With a ferret that can hear, you can train it not to bite by clicking its nose softly and saying the words "Don't bite". But this does not work with a ferret that is deaf. The best way to teach the ferret not to bite is to wave your hand in front of its face when it is attempting to bite; it soon learns that if you wave your hand in front of its face it means that it should not sink its teeth into your finger.
 Another characteristic of a deaf ferret is that it will be very noisy. It will talk to you and make lots of sounds and if it has run out of food, it will make sure you know all about it by jumping up and down and making a lot of noise. Ferrets that can hear generally keep silent, whereas ferrets that can't hear seem to be talking to you, telling you things that it hopes you might perhaps understand.
 A deaf ferret will enjoy going on walks on a lead.
 All ferrets enjoy being picked up and handled. In time your ferret will never bite because it trusts you.
 It is probably best for you to handle the deaf ferret first, then pass the ferret across to the other person, so that the ferret can see what is happening at all times.

 Vitamin E oil is considered a natural antioxidant. As such, it may help to speed up the healing process of the skin. This could potentially help your chickenpox scars fade.Rich sources of the vitamin include spinach, vegetable oils, seeds like sunflowers, raw nuts like almonds, fruits as papaya and avocado. Vitamin E supplements are available at the pharmacies that you can take once or twice daily.
Apply the oils directly to your skin every day. You can also apply a slice of avocado to the area.
Keep in mind this method is not as well researched as medical solutions, and results are inconclusive. It may not work for you personally. Be careful when taking new supplements and always talk to your doctor before incorporating them into your diet.
 Lemon juice has been known to clear up dark spots on skin for some. This may be because it contains vitamin C and citric acid, which both act like exfoliating agents and remove the outer layer of the skin. Try using lemon juice and see if it has an effect.Apply the juice on the affected spots for about ten minutes then wash gently. Pat dry with a clean towel. Avoid using lemon to children who have scars as childrenâ€™s skin are known to be more sensitive than adults.
Like many home remedies, the use of lemon juice to remove scars has not been medically tested. If it makes scars worse or causes skin irritation, cease use and talk to your doctor.
 Honey is one of the best natural antioxidants. In some cases, it's been shown to improve the look of skin. It may be helpful for removing chickenpox scars.Apply a dab of honey over the scar, leave in for 5 minutes, and then remove. Repeat as needed. This may result in scars lessening in appearance. Unlike lemon, honey is safe to use on children.

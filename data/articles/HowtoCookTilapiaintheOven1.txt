 Prepare four squares of heavy duty aluminum foil that are large enough to wrap around each fillet.


Nonstick aluminum foil works best since the tilapia will not stick to it.;
, Coat the fish in the melted butter to prevent it from sticking and to help flavor it.


Since the fish will not be exposed to direct heat with this method, it will not brown and you do not necessarily need to use butter. You could substitute the butter for olive oil as a healthier alternative.
 Drizzle the lemon juice over the fillets evenly and sprinkle with pepper.


If desired, you could also use fresh chopped herbs, like basil. Use no more than 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of herbs.
 Layer 3 to 4 slices over the top of each tilapia fillet.


You do not need to add the tomato, but the benefit of cooking tilapia in foil packets is that you cook vegetables with the fish while infusing the fillets with the flavor.
You can also layer chopped green onion, chopped sweet onion, or chopped bell peppers over the fish.
 Loosely wrap the foil around the tilapia and tomatoes and fold together to form packets.


Leave a small gap of air at the top of each packet to prevent too much steam from building up inside.
, Open each packet to allow the steam to escape and slide the fish, tomatoes and all, onto a serving plate.


Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, if desired.

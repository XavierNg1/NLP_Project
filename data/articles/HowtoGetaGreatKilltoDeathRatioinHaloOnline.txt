 A x8 scope lets you get one shot kills from across the map. A x2 scope is also available for somewhat closer targets. Press your scope button once or twice for a x2 or x8 zoom respectively. Press it a third time to return to normal view.;
, They are a deadly mid-range to close combat weapon. Pistols have a x2 zoom, so they can be used for mid-range sniping. They are also fun to bash people with! It is an instant kill if you sneak up behind someone and bash them with a pistol. This is useful when you come across snipers too busy looking down their scope to notice the big red dot on their radar. Which brings me to my next point.
 Anytime something near you moves, it shows up on your radar. If you see a red dot coming towards you, turn and shoot! Kill more than you get killed, remember?

, If you do, you stand the risk of being sniped of run over.
 This is why many players consider them to be "cheep" and the people who use them to be "noobs". Ignore people who say this. They are only saying this because you got there first. Remember, if they get the chance, they would use a vehicle on you in a second. Be sure to always get there first! Hop in a Warthog and run people over! Swoop down in a Banshee and crush those losers bouncing around below you while hitting them with a rain of plasma from above! Avoid rockets, fuel rods, and grenades.
 Spawn killing is the killing of players just after they die and before they can get good weapons. I like to do this with the sniper rifle. I aim the cross-hairs (with x8 zoom on) from my team's base to the other teams base across the map. I then shoot heads as soon as they appear.

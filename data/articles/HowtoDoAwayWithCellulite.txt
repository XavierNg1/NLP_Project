 Body brushing is a useful but overlooked part of your beauty regime. This step alone has been backed by so many studies performed by experts; it’s hard to understand why so many women do not brush their bodies more. Not only are you stimulating your lymph systems to both remove toxins from your body, (one of the things that causes cellulite) but also improves circulation to the skin meaning that it looks plumper, feels smoother and helps combat that pesky cellulite! Try using a body brush when you get out of the shower and just work in the problem areas for a few minutes, using a circular motion every day. You will soon notice results and wonder why you did not try this sooner!;
, Did you know that this alone can cause cellulite? IF you want cellulite, eat junk food or fatty foods. If you do not want cellulite, eat a diet packed with vegetables and fruit, fresh of course, and drink plenty of water. This helps your skin get the nutrients that it needs as well as the water removing more of those dreaded toxins and overall, you will feel better as well as looking better. What more could you ask for?

, A word that has the ability to have people sweating as they stand but unfortunately, you have to do this to do away with cellulite. The fat that causes the orange peel effect is burnt away with exercise meaning that you have no place for it to look terrible and again, blood flow is improved and skin looks and feels better. All it takes is thirty minutes of physical activity per day and there are even cellulite busting regimes that you can do for quicker results.
 It is hard to disregard these “miracle” potions before you have tried them but if studies are to go by, some of them do actually work. There are both expensive creams and cheap creams and obviously, the costlier ones seem to have the best results but they have got to be worth a try right? THIS ONE by Chrislie Formulations has been proven to be especially effective and comes with a massaging applicator tip.

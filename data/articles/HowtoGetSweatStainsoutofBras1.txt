 Fill the bucket or basin with cold water and laundry detergent. Add a bit of 3% hydrogen peroxide to the bucket and mix thoroughly.This method works well if you have larger stains, as you will soak the entire bra. It would be ideal for sports bras which can get soaked in sweat while exercising.
3% hydrogen peroxide can be used on any bra: white, solid colored, or patterned. It should not leach color from the fabric. Do not use 35% hydrogen peroxide, as this can bleach your bras.;
, Gently swirl the bras around the bucket or basin. You may want to use a long spoon or stick to mix up the solution. Make sure each bra gets thoroughly saturated. You can let your bras sit in this solution for an hour or so., Rinse them under cool water. Do not wring out the bra, but gently press the water out of it. Try gently rolling the bra in a towel to remove the excess moisture., The sun is an excellent bleaching agent, so this will help remove any lingering stains.Using a dryer to dry your bras can damage the fabric, including the elastic and underwire, and leave your bras misshapen.

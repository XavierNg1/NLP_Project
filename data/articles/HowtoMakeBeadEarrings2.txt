 Instead of making your earrings with a sequence of small beads only, you can use a larger decorative bead or a pendant as a way to make your earrings stand out more. Try putting one large, interesting bead near the bottom or center of your earrings, or attach a pendant to the bottom of your endpin.









You can find endpins that have a rounded wire end, which is useful for hanging pendants from.
Unless the pendant already has a jump ring attached, you will need to get some jump rings to attach the pendant. These are small metal ring that you open and close with pliers to attach them to the wire endpin.
 Wire wrapping is a jewelry making technique that can make your hand-crafted earrings look even more intricate and beautiful. You can use pliers to wire wrap large beads and stones, which you can use as a pendant for earrings.









This technique takes some practice and patience to learn, so plan on doing some experimental pieces before you are ready to make earrings.
 Endpins are the classic type of earring base that jewelers use for earrings, but you can also use other types of bases to give your beaded earrings a different design. See what types of earring bases are available at your local crafting store and do some experimentation.


For example, if you want your earrings to have more movement, then you could use some fishing line as the base for your beads instead.Or, you may be able to find some hoop earrings that are thin enough to slide your beads onto.

 You can chill your glass in the freezer for about 10 minutes if you prefer. When the cola and the whipping cream combine, they form a reaction to foam up just like a traditional cola and ice cream float.This is a fun drink to serve at parties with friends.
Remember to always drink responsibly!

, Pour 2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream, 1 1/2 ounces of whipped cream flavored vodka, and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract over the ice. Pour slowly and one at a time.


If you prefer more of a vanilla tasting float, use 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
Make your float stronger or weaker by adding more or less vodka.
 Carefully pour the cola over the mixture. This will cause a bit of foam. Stir well.


You can also add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to make your float creamier.
If you desire more foam, drip a scoop of ice cream into your cup over the ice, and add the cola on top.
 Top it off with a straw and stir frequently to keep it well mixed. Always drink responsibly.

Your porch, attic, or storage cupboard are all good drying options. You can try hanging the rosemary bundles from a clothes hanger, if this is more convenient.






Some people also recommend covering your rosemary with brown paper bags as it dries. This prevents any dust from settling on the rosemary as it dries and also stops any sunlight from bleaching out the color. Just be sure to tear holes in the paper bags to keep the rosemary well ventilated., You'll know the rosemary is dry when all traces of pliability are gone from both stems and leaves. This should take approximately two weeks.


You can also spread your rosemary sprigs or bundles on a flat or slanted window screen, elevated on cinder blocks or wooden blocks, for the best air circulation as they dry.






You won't be able to hang-dry rosemary sprigs in a humid environment, so you may need to dry your rosemary in the oven or in a food dehydrator.
 Once the rosemary has completely dried, place it on a sheet of waxed paper and separate the tough, woody stems from the leaves. Store in an air-tight container in your kitchen cupboard. Use your dried rosemary in recipes such as lamb roasts and stews, garlic and herb bread, and rosemary-infused oil and butter.

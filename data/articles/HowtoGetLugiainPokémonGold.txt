 This will give you access to the Kanto region. After the credits roll, go to Professor Elm's lab to get a ticket to the S.S. Aqua in Olivine City. Go to Olivine City and ride the S.S. Aqua to Vermilion City.;
, In Pewter City, the old man near the exit to Route 3 will give you the Silver Wing if you talk to him.
 The Whirl Islands are located to the east of Cianwood City. You need a Pokémon that knows the move Whirlpool to access the Whirl Islands.


Go through the cave until you reach Lugia's chamber, and press A in front of Lugia's sprite to go into a battle with the level 70 Lugia. If you need help going through the Whirl Islands, search on YouTube for a video that shows the player going through the cave. You'll also want to have a Pokémon that knows the move Flash, since the cave will be pitch black when you first enter it.

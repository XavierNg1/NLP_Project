 Instead of styling your hair every day with flat irons, curling irons, and blow dryers, try limiting it two to three times a week or important days only. When using these tools, use a lower heat setting and prep your hair with a styling cream while it is wet beforehand.Make sure your hair is completely dry before using heat styling tools. Styling your hair while it is still damp can lead to damaged, dry hair.
Rollers are a great substitute for curling irons since they do not cause as much damage to your hair.
 Permanent hair color, relaxers, and perms can all damage your hair if they are done too frequently. Therefore, space out touch-ups and treatments as long as you can. Also, use shampoo products that help the color last longer to reduce your frequency of touch-ups.Keeping your hair treatments within two or three shades of your natural color will help you reduce the amount of touch-ups needed to maintain your look.
 Trimming dead ends is a great way to reduce dryness and improve the overall look of your hair. Trim your hair every six to eight weeks, especially if you use heat styling tools frequently., During the winter and summer months, protect your dry hair from the elements by wearing hats. You can also cover your hair with scarves or another accessory to protect your locks from the cold and heat.During the summer, choose hair products that can protect your hair from UV rays.

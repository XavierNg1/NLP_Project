 The beds of a cottage garden should always be informal and relaxed. A cottage garden breaks the rules, with plants being placed close together and seemingly at random. In reality, however, it takes time and care to design a garden that appears entirely natural.;
, The garden should be full of heady aromas. Use the likes of rosemary, lavender, and honeysuckle, which provide great scent and colour. They can also be cut and placed indoors to perfume the house as owners of cottage gardens have done for centuries.
 A cottage garden should always feel warm and cozy, perhaps even a little claustrophobic. Use height such as arches, hedges, trellises, and pergolas to turn the garden into your own enclosed haven. Cover timber awnings and other house features with trailing plants, such as honeysuckle.
 No cottage garden is complete without roses, in both shrub and bush form, and even climbing, perhaps creating a dramatic arch for your entrance.

 Pour the beaten egg, honey, buttermilk, and two teaspoons of vegetable oil into the dry ingredients. Mix the until the batter is gooey and a bright yellow color. Pour it in a large drinking glass and have it sit for 10 minutes.
 Wipe the hot dogs with a napkin to remove any excess dirt and water. Poke skewers through the bottom of hot dogs. Lay each hot dog on a plate to prepare to frying.
 Dip the hot dogs into the corn dog batter and roll it around so each part is covered with batter.
 Drop the corn dog into the hot oil and have it fry until crispy on all sides. It will usually take about two to three minutes. Ensure that the inside is also cooked properly, or it will be gooey and raw. Use tongs to remove the corn dog. Repeat until there is no more batter.

 At the end of the day try to think of three things that went well for you. Re-play those three things in your mind and write them down. In this way, you’ll trick your mind into focusing on the positive., Expressing gratitude and kindness toward others will not only cheer you up, but other people too. Choose some important people in your life and send them a little reminder of what you like or appreciate about them., When you’re feeling down, you’ll probably notice negative thought patterns start to emerge. Put a stop to these thoughts by confronting them or challenging them with a positive counter-thought.For example, if you’re feeling down about not getting to go outside lately because of bad weather and work, you can say “This won't last forever. I know I can find things indoors to cheer me up in the meantime."

, Take time to vent what you’re frustrated or down about. While it’s important not to overthink or overly focus on the negatives, it’s also important not to ignore them. Instead of denying your feelings or keeping them bottled up inside, express yourself to a trusted friend.If you don’t feel like talking, consider writing in a journal, painting, or drawing.
 If you're holding on to past hurts or resentments, let them go. They're only continuing to bring you pain and suffering if you still focus on them or think about them. Also let go of any mistakes you've made in the past or worries you have for the future. You cannot control those things.

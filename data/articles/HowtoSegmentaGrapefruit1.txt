 The first step in supreming a grapefruit is to remove the peel. Cut off the top and the bottom of the grapefruit, exposing the flesh of the fruit. This will provide you with a flat side to rest the grapefruit on while you cut it. You will be less likely to cut yourself with a flat side providing stability.








”Supreme” is the culinary term used to describe the act of cutting off the peel of a grapefruit and removing the segmented flesh from the bitter pith and membrane.;
, Place the grapefruit on one of the flat ends you cut. With a sharp knife, slice off the peel and pith of the grapefruit, starting from the top and moving your knife to the bottom. Follow the natural curve of the grapefruit. Be sure to avoid cutting off too much of the red flesh.








The pith is the white spongy material between the peel and the red flesh of the grapefruit.
 Remove the peel and pith, turning the grapefruit after every slice. Depending on the size of your knife, this may take between six and eight slices. Once the peel and pith have been completely removed, you may discard them.








Consider composting the peel and pith.
 There may be a few small pieces of pith left on the grapefruit once you have peeled it. Go back and shave off these remaining pieces. Grapefruit pith is quite bitter and you will want to avoid eating it.

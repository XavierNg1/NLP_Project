 The players sit opposite each other. The chess board must be turned so that each player has a white square on the right end of that player's first row. Each player will come up with different square designations, expressed from the point of view of that player.;
, Columns are named for the piece that begins the game on the first row in that column. Types of pieces that appear on both sides of the central king and queen pairing have their columns named not only by the piece, but also by the side of the king and queen pairing where the piece started the game.
 Assume the white player view. For white reading left to right, the columns are QR (queen's rook), QK (queen's knight), QB (queen's bishop), Q (queen), K (king), KB (king's bishop), KN (king's knight) and KR (king's rook.) As the white and black king rook pairings are reversed from each other, the same column names would have been derived if the black point of view had been taken.
 Assign numbers from 1 to 8 for the rows starting at the row nearest the player. Note that unlike the columns, this gives white and black different row numbers. When a move is annotated, the row number used is always the row from the view of the moving player.


Examine the system that has been created. Starting at the square at the left of the white player, the square that is 5 rows up in column 3 should read QB5 for the white player and QB4 for the black player.
 A clear move is annotated with the piece making the move, such as a bishop, a dash and the destination square. If an opposing piece, such as a rook, is taken on the final square, an x instead of a dash is used and the taken piece rather than the destination square would be noted. Therefore the move might be noted B-QB4 (clear move) or BXR (capture.)

 Check your baby’s gums for teeth coming through, or watch for other signs of teething such as excessive drooling, swollen gums, and an upswing in fussiness. Deter your baby from biting due to teething by offering them a teething ring, a cold washcloth, or your finger to chew on right before and right after nursing.This will improve their teething pain while teaching them not to use you as a teething toy.
 Some babies bite out of frustration due to lack of milk. If you’re unsure whether they are getting sufficient milk, break their latch and squeeze your nipple to make sure that milk is coming out.If low milk supply is the problem, try to breast-feed often (about every 2-3 hours), be sure to nurse from both breasts, pump your breasts if you miss a feeding, and don’t drink alcohol or use nicotine..
If you’re struggling with insufficient flow, you may have a blocked milk duct. You would probably also feel soreness in the breast, or some swelling.If this occurs, keep feeding from that breast. Try to massage your breast before feeding. If it doesn’t resolve, gets worse, or you develop a fever, see your doctor., Infants eat fairly regularly, usually about every two to three hours, and if you wait too long to feed your baby may be more likely to bite.Every baby is different, so keep on eye out for your infant’s feeding patterns. Watch for signs that your baby is getting hungry, like moving their mouth, making suction motions, crying or becoming restless., You can usually detect signs that your baby is bored, full, distracted, or otherwise ready to stop feeding. Most biting happens at the end of a feed, so take them off your breast if you notice that your baby is showing signs of being done with their feeding. They may get fidgety, clench their jaw muscles, stop feeding for a moment and look around, or other signs particular to your baby.

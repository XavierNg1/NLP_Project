 Permanent Eraser is a free secure erase program available for Mac. It securely and permanently deletes files, folders, and data from your computer, and can be used to clear the contents of your Trash or to delete a few select files on their own. You can download Permanent Eraser here: http://download.cnet.com/Permanent-Eraser/3000-2092_4-10668789.htmlThis program deletes data even more securely than the "Secure Empty Trash" option does. The former overwrites data seven times, but this utility overwrites the data 35 times, scrambles the original file name, and truncates the file size to nearly nothing before unlinking it from the system entirely.
 With the Permanent Eraser icon displayed, either within its original directory, on the Dock, or on the Finder's sidebar, navigate to the file or folder you want to delete. Click on this file and drag it over to the Permanent Eraser icon before releasing.


When you do this, the program should kick in and begin immediately wiping that file from your hard disk.
Place the Permanent Eraser icon on your Dock by navigating to the application and dragging the icon down to an empty space on your Dock.
Place the icon on your Finder's sidebar by dragging it onto empty space on the sidebar and releasing it there.
 From its original location, the Dock, or the sidebar, click on the Permanent Eraser icon to activate the program. After an initial prompt asking you to confirm your decision, the entire contents of your Trash will be permanently deleted. This option will wipe out all contents, not a single file or folder.

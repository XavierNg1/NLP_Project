 In the A column, type in the names or numbers of the subjects you're taking. In the B column, type in the letter grades you want to factor into your GPA.
 To complete this step, you will have to decide if your school uses a weighted or unweighted GPA scale.


The common 4-point GPA scale is as follows: A = 4 points, B = 3 points, C = 2 points, D = 1 point, and F = 0 points. If your school uses a weighted GPA scale, they allot 5 points for upper level classes. Ask an administrator, teacher, or registrar for this information. You can also look on your report card or final grade sheets.
Add .3 for each plus value or subtract .3 for each minus value. For example, B+ = 3.3, B = 3.0, B- = 2.7.
, This will indicate to the program that it will be calculating a sum (adding) equation.
 The equation you will use to calculate your GPA will be determined by how many grades you have, but the basic format is =SUM(C1:C6)/6.


C1 is the cell number (C- column, 1-row) of the first grade in your column.
The number on the right side of the colon should be the cell number of the final grade on your list.
The number after the slash should be the total number of courses that you are calculating. In this case, 6 courses are being calculated. If you have 10 courses listed, you will replace the 6 with a 10.
 You should be greeted with a single number in the D column, which is your final calculated GPA.

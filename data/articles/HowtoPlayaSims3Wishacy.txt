 It is best to create a Sim with the "family-oriented" trait. Then you will have more of a chance of your sim wishing to have a child so they will be able to continue their bloodline.;
, Select or build a house. This is completely open to the player's preference. Any lot type/house will do as long as it is within the "starting budget" without any money cheats.
 The two main ways to play a wishacy is either the "strict" way (only able to promise/fulfill wishes that are more than one that is already there i.e., four wishes are promised but one of them is worth 150 lifetime happiness points and your Sim generates one worth 300 lifetime happiness points. You would be able to replace the 150 wish with the 300 wish) or the "lenient" way (you can promise any wish that you want and get rid of any wish that you want as long as you always have four wishes promised).
 After you fulfill their lifetime wish you can either give them 24 Sim-hours of your complete control (i.e., even though your Sim doesn't wish to marry someone, you make them marry someone anyway) or you can give yourself complete control for the rest of their lives.
 However, since Sims generate their first wishes when they become children, the heir can only become "valid" or "playable" when he/she becomes a child. After they age up to children take over them and start early on those wishes!

 Spray a thin layer on, add glitter, then let dry. Spray another layer and add more glitter as required. Spray a final layer to seal in the glitter.
 Some craft glues are designed to work on plastic as well as other objects and should stay in place. Sprinkle the glitter over the wet glue and repeat as required.


Scrapbooking glues may be useful for plastic, as they need to cover a range of different materials being glued.
 There are glitter-infused glues that have been specifically designed to adhere glitter to plastic, such as Glitter-It-Glue. Just check the label if you're not sure, or contact the manufacturer directly through their website, Facebook page or Twitter.

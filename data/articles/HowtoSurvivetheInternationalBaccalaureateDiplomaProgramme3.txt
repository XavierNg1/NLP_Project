 These are the subjects you are going to be studying intensively for two years. You're going to write essays, read about, do loads of research and homework on those subjects. Trust me, you don't want to do a Business Management IB course if you wanted to take Theatre Arts instead. You are more likely to be admitted into college with a 5 or 6 in Theatre Arts than a 2 or 3 in Business Management.
 Because of the need to standardize the curriculum across different languages and cultures, they aren't going to test you on anything else. Ever. For example, in Biology, there's not much point learning the names of all the amino acids when you only have to be able to draw a generalised structure (unless you love biology, in which case, more power to you).
 Not knowing command terms will lose you marks you could have gotten otherwise.
 Homework assignments constitute a high percentage of your final IB grade, and you could find yourself overwhelmed by the final exams if you're not diligent. This applies even further if you are doing HL (higher level) science or math.
 Do it well, properly, and early. The sooner you do it, the sooner it's out of the way.
 Otherwise known as Theory of Knowledge. Nail it. It's easy to get the core points for it if you work relatively hard. If your teacher won't teach you, teach yourself. There are books out there which are specifically designed for IB, so go get them.
 You need 50 hours of each, over a two year-period. Try to persuade your school to organize something to help you knock these hours out, for example, photography class, activity weekend, or tuition of younger kids. If all else fails, gardening in school can count as all three. Any help you do in school, get it signed off. Hand in those forms! You'll want to finish this as soon as possible, because by the end you'll need your energy to concentrate on your final exams.

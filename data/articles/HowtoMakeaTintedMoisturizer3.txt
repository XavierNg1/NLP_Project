 You do not need a lot of the tinted moisturizer to get good coverage on your face. Start with a pea sized amount of tinted moisturizer. Using less will ensure the tinted moisturizer goes on smoothly and does not clump up on your face.

Make sure you wash and dry your face before applying the tinted moisturizer.
 Perhaps the easiest and most efficient way to apply the tinted moisturizer is with your fingers. Using your fingers will help to warm up the tinted moisturizer and make it easier to spread on your face. You may put a pea sized amount on a clean finger and then use your other hand to spread the moisturizer over your face in smooth, swooping motions.Always wash your hands as well before using them to apply tinted moisturizer to your face.
Try not to rub the moisturizer too hard on your skin when you apply it. This can lead to irritation and red spots on your skin.
 If you are leery about using your hands to apply makeup to your face, try using a clean makeup brush. Use a brush with a wide head and bristles made for spreading foundation or tinted moisturizer. Start with a small amount on the makeup brush and apply the moisturizer in smooth swoops to your face.

Work quickly so the tinted moisturizer does not start to clump up or dry on the makeup brush. If this happens, you may need to wash the makeup brush and reapply the tinted foundation.

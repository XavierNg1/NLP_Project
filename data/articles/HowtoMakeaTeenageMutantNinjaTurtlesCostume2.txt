 Your top half is what you're most concerned about. For your legs, wear green sweatpants (that ideally match your t-shirt). Those will be left mostly alone, but the shirt will need to be turtle-fied. Here's what you need:

A green t-shirt or sweatshirt






Yellow and brown fabric paint






Paper plates






A foam paintbrush






Cardboard







, This will separate the sides, keeping the paint from seeping through. If you don't have cardboard, use some other sturdy material that you're not worried about getting paint on.


Lay the shirt flat and smooth out all the creases. The cardboard insert needs to be the just short of the width of the shirt when laid out.
If you're using a t-shirt, consider wearing a sweatshirt underneath that is your turtle's color.
 For ideas or a template, go online and see artists' depictions of the Turtles or other costume designs. The yellow is the bottom of the shell -- make it fitting to your size.


It's easiest to use a paper plate as your palette. You can just throw it/them away afterward and not worry about the mess.
 Because there have been so many variations over the years, it's impossible to say 100% what the shell looks like. But a good standard design includes a thin line just inside the border of the yellow and lines separating the block into six squares, with one line down the middle.


If you're going for super-strength turtle, you may want to make your lines look more like abs. Go work on the shell while you let the shirt dry.

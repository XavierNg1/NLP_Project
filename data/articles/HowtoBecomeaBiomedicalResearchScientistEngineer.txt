 Biomedical engineers require considerable knowledge of both engineering and biology. Typically, you'll need to obtain a Master's (M.S.,M.Tech, M.S.E., or M.Eng.) or a Doctoral (Ph.D.) degree in BME (Biomedical Engineering).
 Much of the work in biomedical engineering consists of research and development, spanning a broad array of sub-fields. These fields include such areas as: a) Medical Devices b) Clinical Engineering c) Pharmaceutical Engineering d) Genetic Engineering e) Tissue Engineering and f) Neural Engineering., Multi-speciality Hospitals and Diagnostic Clinics all require specialist biomedical engineers for maintenance and handling of specialised equipment used., An efficient biomedical engineer should have thorough practical based knowledge with an interdisciplinary background in human anatomy, physiology, engineering and technology., Universities providing the best programs in this field include: Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the University of Sheffield, ETH Zurich, Johns Hopkins University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

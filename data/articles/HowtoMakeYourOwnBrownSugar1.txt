 Pour 1 cup (200 g) of granulated sugar into a mixing bowl. Add molasses according to your taste or the type of brown sugar you want. For light brown sugar, use 2 tablespoons (40 g) of molasses. For dark brown sugar, you can use up to 1/4 cup (84 g) of molasses./images/thumb/1/1e/Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-4-preview.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-4-preview.jpg

Ensure that you're using true molasses, not blackstrap molasses. Blackstrap molasses is more refined, less sweet, and higher in sodium than true molasses.;
, For the best texture, use a stand or electric mixer to combine the molasses and sugar until the mixture looks fluffy and golden brown. This can take several minutes.

You can also mix the brown sugar by combining the ingredients in a food processor.
 If you don't have a mixer or just want to make a little brown sugar, you can put the molasses and sugar into a small bowl. Use a fork to combine the mixture until it becomes brown sugar./images/thumb/c/c2/Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg

If you're baking with the brown sugar, you don't even need to combine the sugar and molasses; just add the ingredients to the recipe. For example, if you're making cookies that call for brown sugar, just add extra granulated sugar and the molasses along with the other ingredients.
 If you want to make a large batch of brown sugar to use in several recipes, you can easily double or triple the ingredients. Use a large mixing bowl and electric or stand mixer to combine the brown sugar. Whisk the sugar and molasses for about 5 minutes.

 Using a pin pusher, remove the pin from the link you wish to remove. Make sure you follow the direction of the arrow marked on the underside of the link.
 Hold the band firmly, with one hand on either of the link whose pin you just removed. Gently apply an upward pressure on the side of the link which is closest to the case. At the same time, apply a gentle downwards pressure on the side nearest the clasp. You should be able to feel the mechanism disengaging., Keep applying gentle pressure as you gently "rock" the band to complete the mechanism's release., When the mechanism has been released, you can take the links apart by moving the clasp side of the strap towards the case., Once the links have been disengaged, you will be able to pull the links apart. Try to do this as gently as possible. Repeat for as many links as necessary., To reassemble the watch, simply follow the sames steps as above, but in reverse.

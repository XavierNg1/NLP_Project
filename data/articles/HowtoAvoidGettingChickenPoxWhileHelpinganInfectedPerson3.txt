 There are several populations of people who are at higher risk of developing significant complications that can be life threatening. These people include:Newborns and infants whose mothers have not had the chickenpox or the vaccine
Adults
Pregnant women who haven’t had the chickenpox
People whose immune systems are impaired by medications
People taking steroids
People taking drugs that suppress the immune system

, In some cases, the chickenpox can have serious complications that require emergency medical interventions. Complications from varicella infections include, but are not limited to:Bacterial infections of the skin or soft tissue
Pneumonia
Septicemia (infection in the blood)
Toxic Shock Syndrome
Bone infections
Septic arthritis (joint infection)
Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)
Cerebellar ataxia (inflammation of the cerebellum in the brain)
Dehydration
Joint infections

, Treatments for the chickenpox are usually supportive and done at home. If you are at higher risk and develop other conditions with the chickenpox, then you may need hospitalization for treatment of the secondary infection and supportive therapy. At home treatments will help the individual to recover more comfortably.Common at home treatments for the chickenpox include:


Calamine lotion and colloidal oatmeal baths to help dry out the lesions and relieve the itching.
Non-aspirin medications, such as acetaminophen, to relieve fever. Aspirin products have been associated with Reye’s syndrome which is a severe disease that affects the liver and brain, leading to death.
Antiviral medications for people in a high risk group who may develop secondary infections. Those antiviral medications include acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir.
 If the individual is being treated at home, it is important to know what situations require immediate medical attention.Call your doctor or take the individual to an emergency room if the individual:


Is older than 12 years of age for preventative supportive care
Has a weakened immune system
Is pregnant

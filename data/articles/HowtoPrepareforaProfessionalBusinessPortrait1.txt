 Make an appointment with a photographer well in advance. Visit the websites of several photographers or call them directly to ask about pricing, time frame, and availability. Don’t plan anything immediately following your shoot, in case you and your photographer spend more time than expected.Be aware that different photography studios will have different rules about booking, including cancellation policies. Make sure to choose a appointment on a day and time you’ll be able to keep!
If you need your portrait to be ready by a certain date, schedule you shoot a few weeks before, to make sure there is time for your photos to be edited and finalized.;
, Get eight hours of sleep during each of the two nights preceding your shoot. It’s most important to get plenty of sleep two nights before the shoot, though you should get to bed early the night before too. Otherwise, do whatever makes you feel happy and healthy. In particular, try to squeeze in a jog or another form of exercise on the days leading up to your shoot.Avoid drinking the night before your shoot. Alcohol can have a detrimental effect on your in skin tone, give you baggy eyes, and diminish the quality of your rest.
 Plan to get your hair trimmed about a week before the shoot. Don’t plan to get a haircut the day before, as this may lead to evident tan lines along the edges of your hairline. Further, ensure your skin is in good shape for the shoot by taking care to prevent a sunburn in the days preceding your shoot. If you do want to tan before the shoot, do so at least a few days before.Avoid spray-tanning before a photo shoot.
A hair cut might be worth the time even if you don’t think you need one. Getting rid of split ends or touching up any grey areas can greatly improve the quality of your photos.

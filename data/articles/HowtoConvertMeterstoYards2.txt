 As noted above, the actual conversion is closer to 1.0936 yards, but you should round up this number to make it easier to calculate by hand. While 1.1 slightly overshoots the actual conversion, it is only by .0064 yards -- not enough to throw off a basic estimation.

Though this method is close, remember that you are slightly overestimating -- your final answer will be slightly larger than the actual conversion., Meters and yards are almost the exact same length. The difference is in the .1, which is easy to calculate. Since anything multiplied by 1 is itself (1∗15=15{\displaystyle 1*15=15}, all you need to do is find the .1 portion and add it to your number of meters.

Ex. Estimate the number of yards in 15 meters?

Ex. 15 meters = 15 yards + ?


, Simply take your number of meters and shift the decimal over one place -- this is the exact same thing as "multiplying by .1" So, for the example problem:

Ex. Estimate the number of yards in 15 meters?

Ex. 15meters=15yards+{\displaystyle 15meters=15yards+} ?

Ex. 15meters∗.1=1.5{\displaystyle 15meters*.1=1.5}


, The only math you really have to do is addition! Once you've moved the decimal over, simply add this number to the original number of meters. Thus:

Ex. Estimate the number of yards in 15 meters?

Ex. 15meters=15yards+{\displaystyle 15meters=15yards+} ?

Ex. 15meters∗.1=1.5{\displaystyle 15meters*.1=1.5}

Ex. 15meters=15yards+1.5{\displaystyle 15meters=15yards+1.5}


15meters=16.5yards{\displaystyle 15meters=16.5yards}


, The actual conversion of 15 meters is 16.4042 yards, meaning the estimation was only about .1 yards off. Note that this difference is only going to get bigger with bigger calculations -- 150 meters would estimate to 165 yards, but that's 1.6 yards off from the actual conversion. A good way to eliminate this over-estimation easily is to subtract .1 for every ten yards:

In the first example, you have 16.5 yards. To correct it, you can subtract .1, because there is only one "10" in 16. Your final answer is 16.4 yards

For the bigger example, you'd subtract 1.6 yards, because there are sixteen "10s" in 165. Your final answer is 163.4 yards.

 If you think your teen is cutting, don’t freak out – at least, not in front of them. Take the time to regain your composure and let your feelings settle a little. Wait to talk to your child until you’ve calmed down. If you panic or yell at them, you’ll only make them feel ashamed or defensive, and that won’t be productive for either of you.It’s normal to feel a lot of negative emotions if you find out your child is cutting. You might feel scared, angry, confused, and sad all at once. These feelings are valid, but it’s not a good idea to take them out on your child.
Remember, your teen isn’t cutting to upset you. They’re dealing with their own painful feelings. A calm, compassionate approach will work best with them.
 Be straightforward. Say something like, “I’ve noticed that you have a lot of scratches on your arms these days. Are you cutting yourself?”Use a warm, gentle tone. If you sound accusatory, your teen might get angry or defensive.
If your child admits that they’re cutting, ask follow-up questions to understand them better, like, “What makes you want to cut?” and “How do you feel after you cut yourself?”

, Make your child feels understood and loved, not judged. Listen to them and do your best to see where they’re coming from. Say something like, “I know you’ve got to be struggling a lot right now.”, Your child’s cutting affects you deeply, of course, but making them feel worse won’t solve anything. Don’t say anything like, “I’ve been a terrible parent to you” or “How could you do this to me?”It’s not your fault that your teen is cutting. However, if you take the right steps, you can be part of the reason why they stop.
 Make sure your teen knows they have your love and support, no matter what. Emphasize that they don’t need to feel guilty or embarrassed about asking for help.Say something like, “I want to help you feel better however I can. If you ever need anything, or if you just want to talk, you can come to me.”

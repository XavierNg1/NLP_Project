 Start by determining what weight paper you would like to use.


Standard weight is the most economical and works well with high-speed copiers.
Mid weight paper can be used in copiers and inkjet or laser printers. It’s slightly heavier so it’s good for double-sided copies.
Heavy weight paper has a smooth finish. Due to its weight, however, it may slow down or jam a copy machine. Printing the original on heavy weight paper with an inkjet or laser printer can improve copy clarity., Don’t be afraid to inquire at paper supply companies. If you are within an office try to get an idea of what paper has worked well in the past.


If you’re limited in your office paper choice ask about the best photocopying method for your machine. Approach someone you’ve noticed using the machine and see if they have any advice for you.
 This will give the copy a higher contrast, which will make it easier to read. Brightness ranges anywhere from 84 to over 100. Choose a brightness on the high end of the spectrum.


Remember that copies print best from a white or light pastel colored original, no matter what color copy you wish to make. Deep color originals will copy gray and may be unreadable.
Choose acid free paper. Most paper is acid free but it doesn't hurt to check the label.

 Kik gives you the opportunity to play games, fill out surveys, or sign up for services in exchange for “points” that can be used as currency in the app.You can use Kik Points get new smileys from the Smiley Store. To begin earning points, start a chat with the chat bot ”kikpoints.”


Offers change daily. Chat with “kikpoints” every day to make sure you don’t miss out on that day’s opportunity to gain points.
The number of points will vary depending on the offer.
 Now you’ll have the opportunity to replace the standard smileys with new ones from the Smiley Store. Themed smileys are variations of the yellow ones already in your smiley tray.
, Scroll through the list to view the available smiley Collections, which are groups of smileys that share a common theme.
 Now you can see the smileys close-up.
 A pop-up will appear displaying the amount of Kik Points (kp) necessary to get it from the shop.
 One of two things will now happen:


If you have enough Kik Points to pay for the smiley, you’ll see a screen that restates the amount of Kik Points necessary to get the smiley, and a button that says “Confirm.” Click “Confirm” to add the smiley.
If you don’t have enough Kik Points, you’ll see “You don’t have enough Kik Points,” as well as a button that says “Earn Kik Points.” Tap that button to start earning more Kik Points, or hit the back button to view other smileys.
 Now you can use your smiley in at chat the way you would with other smileys. If you don’t see it when you hit the :) icon, tap the “+” and select it from your locker.

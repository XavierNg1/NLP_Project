 Unless you want the finished candle holder to have its label displayed, peel the label away with your fingers. You can use dish soap and a scouring pad to remove any remaining adhesive from the coffee can.;
, For the candle's light to escape in decorative patterns, you will need to punch holes in a random pattern all around the coffee can. You can do this using an electric drill or by hammering a nail into the can to create each hole.
 After punching the holes in the can, you can place a candle into the lamp and light it. The coffee can's size will allow it to hold tea lights, votives, and small pillar candles comfortably. In low light, your coffee can lamp will project flickering star-like patterns onto your walls through the holes.

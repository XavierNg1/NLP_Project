 This event takes place on a dirt road east of where a race is available, and directly south of an available base jump. Three red blips will appear on your map if the event has been triggered.
 Three rednecks will follow you on two dirt bikes and one ATV, and then will start shooting at you. Franklin’s special ability can be used to slow down time as you do a drive-by (shooting from inside your vehicle). The event will be considered complete when you’ve killed them all.


Try to kill the one carrying a sawed-off shotgun first, as his weapon does more damage than the others’ pistols.They’ll be attacking from multiple angles, so you will be safest inside your vehicle.
Running over them is an option. However, shooting at them is likely the fastest route.
You can drive away from them, but doing so will not complete the event.
 You will gain roughly $600 from the wallets they dropped. They will also have dropped ammo for their pistols and sawed-off shotgun.

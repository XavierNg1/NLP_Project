Look north for the globular clusters M10 and M12. Use a small telescope.
Look south for NGC 3532. This can be seen with the naked eye but if you use binoculars you'll see more stars.
Using a small telescope, look south for cluster NGC 3114.
Using binoculars, look south for open cluster NGC 2516. This will be similar in size to the full moon as seen in the sky.
Looking north, and using a small telescope, look for NGC 6633

Look north for open cluster IC 4665 near the star Cebalrai or Beta Ophiuchi. This can be seen with binoculars.

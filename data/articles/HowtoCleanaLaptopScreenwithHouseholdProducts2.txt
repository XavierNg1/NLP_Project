 Since you're using a liquid to clean the screen in this method, it's important to turn off the computer and unplug it from the outlet., The ideal solution is plain distilled water, which contains no chemicals and is gentle on the screen. If heavier cleaning is needed, a 50/50 mix of white vinegar and distilled water can also be effective.


Make sure you use plain white vinegar, not apple cider vinegar or any other kind.
Distilled water is better than tap water because it's chemical-free.
Manufacturers no longer recommend using any cleaners with alcohol, ammonia or any strong solvents on LCD screens.
 This is the the type of spray bottle that you push from the top to get a fine mist, similar to a perfume bottle. Pour some of the solution into the spray bottle and screw on the top. Don't use this to spray on the screen itself, however.
 A static-free, fiber-free cloth works best. Remember not to use regular cloth, since this could scratch the screen. Do not soak the cloth; you just want to get it moist, which is the purpose of using the atomizer bottle to wet it.


A wet cloth can drip or run when cleaning the screen and the solution can weep behind the bezel and permanently damage your screen.
Try applying the solution to just one corner of the cloth at a time, to make sure you don't get it too wet.
 Rapid circular movements generally eliminate streaks. Apply a gentle and even pressure to the cloth. Use only enough pressure to keep the cloth in contact with the screen. Take care not to press your fingers into the cloth or screen, since applying too much force when cleaning the screen can permanently damage the LCD matrix and render your screen unusable.


Hold the screen toward the very top or very bottom to avoid re-smudging it as you work.
You may need to pass over the screen multiple times before all the smudges have been removed. You may also need to re-dampen the cloth as you work, depending on how many passes over the screen you need to make.

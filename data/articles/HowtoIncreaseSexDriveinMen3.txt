 Many men experience low sex drive due to stress, depression, anxiety, relationship problems, and exhaustion.Physical issues obtaining an erection can also create anxiety, which will compound the problem. But closely consider whether you might have any latent emotional issues that are bothering you.
 Sex therapy has been shown to improve sex problems in about two out of three cases. A sex therapist should be able to recognize the origins of your problem and provide effective guidance in treating it.Include your partner, if you have one. It is important that both of you are working toward the same goal and are aware of how to effectively reach it.
 Stress can significantly reduce your sex drive. Work and children can also take time away from developing a healthy relationship. Make time to relax and enjoy your partner.


You don't have to make love at night, when you are likely to be most tried and stressed. Trying finding time throughout the day, possibly in the morning or while showering.
Even if you don't have time to run away to the bed with your partner, you do have time to kiss him, hold his hand, or massage his shoulder. Intersperse physical interaction throughout the day, whenever you are around your partner, to help keep him in the mood.

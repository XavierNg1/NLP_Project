 While there is no guarantee that pursuing a Master of Business Administration degree will allow you to meet Warren Buffett, this is actually the best method to pursue if you hope to speak with him in person.


Six times each year, Mr. Buffett invites graduate level business students from 45 universities to come to his office in Omaha, Nebraska.
During these visits, the students interact with him during a 90-minute question and answer session. Afterward, he treats the students to lunch.
Each college can only send 20 students, and of those students, 30 percent or more must be women.
 Warren Buffett has a shareholder meeting once every year. You can hear him speak, but the odds are low that you will actually be able to meet him or speak to him in return.


The meeting is usually on the first Saturday of May.

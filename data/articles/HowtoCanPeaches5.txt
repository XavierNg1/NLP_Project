If you do not have a canner, you can make your own. Find a pot or saucepan that is large enough to hold the jars. There should also be room for an inch of water above the jars. Place a washcloth or towel at the bottom of the pot before you put the jars in. This will keep the jars from directly touching the metal of the pot.
 Canning time varies according to the type of canner you have and the altitude of your location. Be sure to check your canner's instructions.









If you are using a boiling water canner, these guidelines should help. For 0–1,000 feet (0.0–304.8 m) above sea level, cook for 10 minutes. For 1,001–3,000 feet (305.1–914.4 m), cook for 15 minutes. For 3,001–6,000 feet (914.7–1,828.8 m), cook for 20 minutes. If you are above 6,000 feet (1,828.8 m), cook for 25 minutes.
If you are using a dial gauge pressure canner or a weighted gauge pressure canner, you will need about 8 minutes. Clarify with the instruction manual of your canner.

Don't come to school the first day with a crazy new hair color. Wait a few weeks later when you're sure it won't leave a bad impression. Same with extensions.
If your hair is oily, wash it with Dawn dish soap before you shampoo and condition.

Wash your hair well.



If you have acne, you should use Dawn on your face once a week or so. It really does get rid of the oil.
If you like wearing make-up, don't go overboard. Try to go for just the basics.
 Also, just because it doesn't look good on you doesn't mean you're fat. Some girls are different heights or shapes, and it really affects how clothes look on them.
 If you believe you're beautiful, you will be more beautiful to everyone that looks at you!


Find yourself some cool accessories, but don't pay mall prices for them. Go to Amazon.com and you'll be able to find just about anything you can find in a mall. You don't need to pay fifteen dollars for a necklace when you can buy it online for three bucks.
 Don't wear stilettos if your class is on the fourth floor, but tennis shoes are good for the trip up. Wear something that's stylish, but comfortable.


Invest in a great pair of cozy, waterproof, easily-washable boots for winter, if it applies to you.
Find good socks. Ditch the tube socks and get something that's comfortable.

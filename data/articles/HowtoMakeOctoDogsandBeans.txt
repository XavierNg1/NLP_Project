 Preheat the stovetop to medium heat. Place a skillet or frying pan on the heat and sprinkle olive oil over it. Fry hot dogs until crispy and lightly roasted, usually taking about ten minutes.;
,,, Lay one hot dog on its side on a cutting board. Using a knife, slice the hot dog from the top to all the way down lengthwise, making four segments.
, Slice each segment in half lengthwise, making 8 "legs" on the hot dog. Repeat with the rest of the hot dogs.
,, This will resemble an octopus.
 Sprinkle and garnish the fish-shaped crackers all over each plate. Enjoy!

 If you're at the gym, grab onto a chest-high stretch bar. If you're at home or at your office, grab onto the edge of a desk or the knob of a closed door.


The exact object doesn't matter, but it should be stationary, steady, and between waist and chest height. You'll be using it to keep yourself steady as you perform the stretch.
Grab the bar with only one hand and keep the rest of your posture relatively straight, yet limber. You should be standing with your feet approximately shoulder-width apart. Do not lock your knees.
 Gently push your chest forward while holding onto the bar. Continue stretching until the muscles of your chest feel mild discomfort without feeling any pain.This position should allow you to stretch the chest, shoulders, and biceps. You should feel the muscle groups in those areas contract as you stretch.
Essentially, you're pushing these muscle groups to their end range. Do not push them beyond this point, however, since doing so could cause pain and greater damage.
 Continue leaning forward for a full 30 seconds, then gradually release your position and return to an upright stance.


For the first 15 to 20 seconds, this stance will stretch your muscles. During the final 10 to 15 seconds, the muscles will relax, and the connective ligaments lying beneath will begin to stretch.
Return to an upright stance over several seconds rather than darting back instantaneously. Sharp movements can actually cause damage.
 Grab the same steady object with your other hand, then lean forward again for another 30 seconds.


Other than the hand you use, everything about this second stretch should be the same as the first.
Switching hands will allow you to stress the ligaments in both shoulders.

 You will need a dowel rod (with roughly ½” diameter), a second dowel rod or dowel pins (roughly ¼” diameter, as it must fit inside the first dowel rod), a wood spindle (sometimes called a chair spindle or a decorator spindle), wood glue, a saw, sandpaper, and a drill with a bit similar to the dowel pin you use.
 This will form the main part of the wand. It can be whatever length you prefer (in Harry Potter, Hagrid’s wand is 16” but some wands are a small as 9”). Measure it and cut it to size using the saw. You can sand and round the tip using the sandpaper if you want to.
 The spindle will form the handle. You can usually get two handles from a single spindle. Cut it into whatever pieces you feel are appropriate using the saw.
 Drill a hole at the center of both the handle and the main section of the wand where the two will join together, going up into the core of each. Be careful to drill straight and not use a drill bit which is too large for the pin you will place.
 Using either a much thinner dowel rod trimmed to size or appropriately sized pre-cut dowel pins, cover the pin in glue and place it in the handle hole. Once it is in place, put the other end into the hole in the main section of the wand. Push them together until they are solidly joined. If there is too much resistance, you can use a hammer or other heavy object to gently tap them into place.
 Remove excess glue and sand any rough spots. You can also paint or stain your wand to whatever your desired color may be. You can use tools, such as an awl or screwdriver, to gently tap texture into the wood of the handle (like that on the Elder Wand in Harry Potter). You can also add polymer clay to the wand (before painting or staining) to make it look more like the wands from the films, if you have the skill to sculpt and texture it. Once your desired details are added, you’re done!

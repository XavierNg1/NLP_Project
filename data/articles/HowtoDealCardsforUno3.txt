 Each player now has a "hand" of (probably) seven cards. Give the players a few moments to arrange their cards in an effective way. This is when most experienced players begin to make connections between their cards and plan out the beginnings of their strategy.
 Once everyone has the right amount of cards, the dealer picks up the card at the top of the deck places it face-up in the Discard pile. Then, the dealer picks the next card and lays it on the table for everyone to see. This is the starting card. If it is a power-up card (e.g. Draw Two, Draw For, Wild), deal another card on top of it.
 Start from the card that is face-up in the center of the table. The player who is going first puts down a card that of the same number or color from his or her own 7-card hand. Then the person on the left (clockwise) or right (counterclockwise) does the same. The game continues in that direction. The goal of the game is to get rid of all your cards â€“ the last person holding cards "loses".

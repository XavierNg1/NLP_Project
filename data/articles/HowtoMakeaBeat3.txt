 If you just need a quick beat for recording a video for Youtube or something like that, you can use a free Javascript program. There are a number of these online, which will allow you to create a basic beat.
 If you're wanting something cheap but a little more powerful, there are a number of apps for Android or iOS that you can use. These may cost only a dollar or two, or be free altogether. Try to get one which exports mp3s.
 There are sound softwares, like Audacity, which are high quality but free. These take a little more work, training, and skill, since you will have to engineer the audio yourself.


Audacity, for example, will require you to have sound samples and to stitch them together yourself, but the final product can sound much more professional and you'll have a lot more control.
 There are professional sound programs which you can use if you're serious about making music. These are very expensive, usually several hundred dollars, but they are what the pros use and what pros will expect. You will need a great sample library to go along with these programs.

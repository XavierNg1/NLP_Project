 You will want to avoid trimming or shaving your dog’s fur during the winter months, because their full coat is a great source of warmth and protection. Instead, it is important to keep you dog’s coat brushed, groomed, and free of tangles. Matted fur is less effective at keeping your dog warm.Brush your dog’s fur daily to remove tangles.
Consider taking them to a professional groomer, but be sure to explain that you’d like their fur to be left long.
 The fur on your dog’s paws can trap ice, making your older dog cold and uncomfortable. Additionally, excess fur on the paws can make it easier for your dog to slip.Hold your dog’s paw with one hand, and use a sharp pair of scissors to snip off any fur that covers the pads of their foot.
You may also consider having this done by a professional groomer.
 Frostbite is a common occurrence, especially in small dogs. Frostbite can be easily treated if diagnosed immediately, so keep an eye out for symptoms.First-degree frostbite can be easy to miss. Look for pale skin on your dog’s extremities (such as ears, lips, tail, face, and feet). This skin may also feel cold to the touch. When the affected skin warms up, it can look red, swollen, and be painful to touch.
Second-degree frostbite involves the development of skin blisters.
Third-degree frostbite (the most serious) will involve your dog’s skin turning black or dark blue. You will see a clear difference between frostbitten and undamaged skin.
Seek medical attention right away if you recognize signs of frostbite on your dog.
 Existing ailments, such as arthritis, osteoporosis, and others, can be exacerbated by the cold. If your senior dog has been diagnosed with any of these, speak to your vet about any additional medications or treatments you should provide.Watch out for symptoms of pain, such as limping, lying down more than usual, or yelping when touched.
Speak to your vet to discuss symptoms and treatment options.

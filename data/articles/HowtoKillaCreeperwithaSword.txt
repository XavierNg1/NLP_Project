 Creepers are found almost anywhere. They spawn in the dark but sunlight won't harm them, so they can go wherever they want.;
,, Left click with a sword in your hand.


Try not to use stone or weaker swords.
If all else fails, use a bow.
 This is so that the creeper can't explode near you. You might want to get higher than the creeper to get a small advantage.
 Most of the time, the creeper will drop gunpowder which you can put into your inventory. (It's used to craft TNT.) All done!

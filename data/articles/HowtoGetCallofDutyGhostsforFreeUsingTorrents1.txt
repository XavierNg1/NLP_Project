 These applications allow user to share files between each other directly from one computer to another; hence, the title “Peer-to-Peer”.


Most free installers are commonly shared through this method so you need this type of application to get a free COD: Ghosts copy over the Internet.;
, Torrent files let your Peer-to-Peer application see which computers connected to the Internet are currently sharing the file you’re looking for.


Popular sites where you can get a COD Ghosts torrent file are Kick ass Torrents (http://kickass.to/) and Mininova (http://www.mininova.org/).
Just enter COD Ghosts on the search bar of any torrent site and all the torrent files related to what you searched for will appear.
When downloading torrent files, always get the one that has more “Seeds” than “Leech”. Seeds are the number of computers sharing or uploading the file while Leech shows the number of computers downloading it. The more seeders there are over leechers, the faster you can download the file.
 Double-click on the torrent file, and if you already installed the software, it should open with the Peer-to-Peer application.


It will take a few hours, depending on the speed of your connection, to download the COD: Ghosts installer.
Shutting down your PC won’t interrupt its download so you can turn your system off if you like and resume the download later anytime you like.

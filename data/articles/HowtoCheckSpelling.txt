 Even if you are the queen in your spelling bee, having a dictionary is absolutely necessary for everyone, for references, synonyms, origins, etc. It's so easy to look up a word in the dictionary. Figure out the first letter and find it.


If you take a language, it may be helpful to get dictionary of that language to your own language. Example: English to Spanish dictionary.
You can always use an online dictionary, but nothing beats an old fashioned, hard copy of a dictionary.

, Somebody has to know how to spell the word you are looking for. Ask a classmate, teacher, parent, etc. Just say, "How do you spell..." It's that simple. If they don't know, ask someone else, or look it up.
 The internet or the dictionary application is an efficient and easy way to find the spelling and definition of a word. If you type in the word, and it's the wrong spelling, it will suggest a better spelling, because someone else in the world must have spelled it the way you did.
 Go with your gut and choose the best guess. It's a great way to perfect further mistakes: learning from them! Don't rely on this way, and do have another source you can check the spelling from, but if you're in a hurry, take a guess. Even on hard words this works; unless it's one with many vowels, this is usually easy. Don't guess if you're really not sure, though.
 If you really can't figure out how to spell it no matter how many sources you've tried, find a different word. Seek for one that means the same thing but is spelled in a different, easier way. Who knows...this one might even fit better.
 If you know the meaning of a word yet not sure of its spelling and don't know where to start, try searching with the meaning instead. An online thesaurus works wonders!

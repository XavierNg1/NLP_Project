 Stand the pepper on the cutting board, stem side up. Grip the knife by pinching the blade, right above the handle, with your thumb and the second knuckle of your index finger; your remaining three fingers should grip the handle to give you more control over the blade. Cut the pepper from top to bottom, starting close to the stem and cutting through to the bottom.





;
, Pick up one half of the pepper, cupping it firmly on the outside. Using the tip of your knife, trace and cut away the halved seed cluster from the inside of the pepper piece. Carefully remove and discard it, then repeat with the other pepper half., Brace the halved peppers carefully and cut them into quarters. Using the tip of your knife, carefully remove the stem from the top piece and discard it. Scrape out any remaining seeds from the inside of the pepper pieces.
 Lay the pepper pieces on the cutting board, skin-side up. Using the blade of your knife or the palm of your hand, gently press down the pieces and flatten them as much as possible; this will make the pepper much easier to cut. Flip up the pieces and use the tip of your knife to remove the ribs inside.
 Push the blade downward onto the pepper pieces in a rocking motion while holding them steady with your free hand; be sure to keep your fingers out of the blade's way. As you rock the blade downward, push the handle away from you slightly, which will draw the blade over the cutting surface more efficiently. Continue until all pieces are julienned.

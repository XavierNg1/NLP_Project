 Get a large flower planter and drill a hole with a drill and ceramic bit that is large enough to get the power cord through. Use silicon or Sugru to patch the hole once the cord is through. Make sure it is very secure and watertight. Coat the whole inside with a water sealant to protect your pot.
 You'll need a 1/2" rubber tube cut to 1' or more taller than your

, You'll need to find another flower planter but this time a bit smaller. It should have an opening about the size of the base of the first, and reach to about 2/3 of the way up the first pot. Use a file to create notches in the lip of the pot and then drill a hole at the center of the bottom large enough to get 1/2" rubber tube through. Put this pot inside the first, upside down, pulling the tubing through the hole as you go.
 Place another large pot, using the upside down one as a base. You will also need to drill a tubing hole in this pot. Continue placing pots in this manner until it looks like you have 3 nested pots. Don't forget about the hole for the tubing and the notches on the rim of the 2 upside down pots.
 Ta-da! Your garden fountain is done!

 You can also use basic white glue to apply glitter. You can use either a glue stick or a glue bottle. White glue is typically washable, meaning that it is water-soluble. Do not use white glue if you think that the wooden object will get wet, like if you intend to leave it outdoors.
 You can either use the squeeze bottle to directly apply the glue to the wood, or you can paint it on using a foam wedge or paintbrush. With a glue stick, you can apply the glue directly to the wood.


Thicker layers of glue will appear raised when they dry. This might look best for your project, or you might prefer a flatter glittered area.
 You can dust the wet glue with glitter, covering as much or as little of the wood as you'd like.
 The glue will dry clear so only the glitter will remain. The actual time it takes for the glue to dry will depend upon how thick of a glue layer youâ€™ve applied.


Apply a sealant, if desired. Like with the spray adhesive method, you can use a spray sealant to smooth your dried glitter. This will help to prevent glitter from falling off, and eliminates some of the rough texture.

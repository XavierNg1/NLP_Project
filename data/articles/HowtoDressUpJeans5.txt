 A silk or satin fashion scarf in a bright, bold color dresses up your jeans for a number of occasions. You can wear one with a button-down shirt to dress up your jeans for the office, or you can wear one with a fitted t-shirt to dress up your jeans for the weekend.
 A thin belt looks especially sophisticated, but any belt will help add the structure you need to bump up your ensemble from casual to chic.
 Dangling earrings with a bit of shimmer can really give your jeans an added boost of class.
 These may not make your outfit look more professional, but a colorful piece of jewelry may help transform it for a night out with friends.
 Pearls are the ultimate in timeless sophistication. A simple strand of pearls around your neck or subdued pearl post earrings can even make jeans look dressy.
 Like colorful necklaces and bracelets, this style element can help transform your outfit into a semi-dressy ensemble for a night out with friends. It may not, however, work for the office or a more demanding occasion.
 For a romantic date or an evening function, consider a clutch or other small purse that hangs off a delicate strap. Smaller purses naturally look a little dressier than larger purses, especially in a neutral color like black or brown.
 Focus on one feature and play it up. Wear a bold shade of lipstick or give yourself smoky eyes.

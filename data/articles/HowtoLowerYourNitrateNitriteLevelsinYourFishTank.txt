 In order to maintain a fish tank, you should be doing at least a 25% water change every week. When you do a water change, you are removing nitrate-laden water and replacing it with fresh, nitrate-free water. Leaving this too long will result in a build-up of nitrate that can harm your fish.;
, Remember that a fish's stomach is around the same size as his eye. A little food goes a long way.


If you are giving fish several different kinds of foods (brine shrimp, blood worms, flakes, etc. ) then make sure the amount is controlled.
Place the food at feeding times in a place where the fish will actually be able to find and eat it.
Remove any uneaten food from the tank with a gravel vacuum or clean turkey baster.
 Remember that this guideline is only for smaller tropical fish. A 12-inch pleco cannot fit into a 12 gallon (45.4 L) tank, and a 10-inch fish has no place in a 30 gallon (113.6 L) tank. Use your common sense.
 If it is high, then find another water source, and do a water change with it.

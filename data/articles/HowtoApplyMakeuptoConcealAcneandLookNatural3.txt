 Use three colors that are in the same color family. Many brands carry sets of eye shadow so you have all three colors to start off with. Avoid options with a lot of sheen. Instead, look for a matte or semi-matte option. You should also avoid bold colors and stick to more neutral tones to achieve the natural look.


Start with the lightest shade and apply from your eyelashes to your brow bone.
Take your medium shade and apply to just your eyelid.
Take your darkest shade, and very gently apply that to your crease.
Use your brush to blend the colors so they seamlessly transition and you cannot tell where each color begins or ends.
 Use a neutral black or brown and start in the interior corner of your eye and move out. Your eyeliner should be as thin as possible if you are striving to look natural. You can use a pencil, gel, or liquid eyeliner. It's whatever you are most comfortable using and the option you can control most when applying.
 Start by opening your eye wide and placing the brush as close to the bottom of your eyelashes as you can go without touching and irritating your eye. As you move the brush towards the ends of your lashes, twirl the brush for even application and less clumping.

 You can ask a court to order the release of your original birth certificate. To do so, you must file a petition under one of two codes sections: Health and Safety Code Section 102705, or Family Code Section 9200. If you are petitioning under the Health and Safety Code, you can file your petition in the county where you live, or in the county where the adoption was finalized. If you are petitioning under the Family Code, you must file your petition in the county where the adoption was granted., Different counties in California use different forms for these types of requests. Contact your court clerk to find out exactly which forms you should use for a petition in your county. You will be required to provide identifying information about yourself and the adoption proceeding. You must also give the reasons why you are requesting the birth certificate.The court can deny your request if it determines that your interest in obtaining the birth certificate is outweighed by the privacy interests of the adoptee or the birth parents.


For example, San Mateo County uses a form called "Adopt-10" (https://www.sanmateocourt.org/documents/forms_and_filing/adopt-10.pdf) for Health and Safety Code requests, while Ventura County uses a form called "VN200" (http://www.ventura.courts.ca.gov/local_forms/VN200.pdf) for requests under the Health and Safety and Family Codes.
 Take your forms to the court clerk, who will assist you with the filing. You may be charged a filing fee. The clerk will inform you whether you will need return to court for a hearing. Otherwise, the judge will review your petition and grant or deny it. The court clerk will inform you of the court's decision.


If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, ask the clerk for information on how to file an application for a fee waiver.

 Add half a teaspoon of salt to 8 ounces of warm water and mix well. Sip and gargle for 10 seconds, then spit--do NOT swallow.

Repeat this 2 to 3 times per day, until your throat feels better.;
, Honey is a fantastic natural remedy, as it coats the throat and quickly relieves any itchiness or irritation. For best results, eat a tablespoon of honey each morning.

If you don't want to invest in a humidifier, you can achieve the same results by placing a large bowl of water under the radiator or by keeping plants in your living space.
 Dehydration is one of the most common causes of an itchy throat, as your throat becomes dried out and there is not enough mucus to lubricate and protect the sensitive tissue.


Try to drink at least 8 glasses of water per day and drink plenty of green and herbal teas.
Drinking water is especially important if you have a flu or cold, as you tend to lose a lot of fluids through sweat (from fever) and mucus (from sneezing and blowing your nose).

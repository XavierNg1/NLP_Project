 Find a good masseuse and take advantage of her skills. Schedule routine appointments with the masseuse to help ease tension and relieve stress. Not only will you feel pampered which will help you to relax your body and get rid of your added stress, but some studies show that regular massage therapy can help increase fertility levels in women trying to conceive.


Massages can also be a great way to connect with your partner. You donâ€™t always have to rely on a professional when you have someone at home who can give you a massage just as easily. Additionally, massages have been found to be a great way for couples to connect on an intimate level.
 Vacations are one of the best ways to relax and escape your daily worries. Find an activity or a place that you and your partner enjoy and book your trip. This can also be a great time to try to conceive because you will be in a stress-free and relaxing environment away from all the concerns of your daily life.

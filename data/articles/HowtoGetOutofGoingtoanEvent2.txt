 You should never claim a serious or debilitating illness you do not actually have, as these claims are easily debunked. This is especially true if the function in question is a work function, as your supervisor could request that a doctor’s note be delivered.Real but safe illnesses include the flu, a cold, bronchitis, or (for women) even a case of severe menstrual cramps.
 On the date of the event you’re hoping to avoid, do not--under any circumstances--leave the house. Sick people do not go out shopping, run errands, or drive around, unless a visit to the pharmacy is in order. Stay home to avoid suspicion.


If you cannot stay home, prepare yourself for the possibility of running into someone. Have an excuse for being out and about at the ready.
 During the time of the event, give yourself some at-home pampering. This way, if someone asks how your evening went, you can honestly say something such as, “I took it easy, took a bath, and stayed in bed for most of the night,” or something similar.If you claimed to have a cold or the flu, you can give yourself a facial to reveal fresh, pink skin to create the illusion of being tired or out of sorts.
 Don’t go into specifics about your illness. You can simply say you were under the weather. Most people do not want to hear the details of others’ sickness, anyway, so do not feel you have to volunteer detailed information.If someone does ask exactly what was wrong with you, you can grimace and say, “You don’t want to know,” or something in a similar vein.
 If necessary, contact the host and once again express your regret at having fallen ill, and ask how the event went. Doing so lends more credibility to your illness, as it creates the illusion that you are genuinely disappointed at having missed the party.

 Find a place with lots of street side shops. A good place is Khao San Road. It's where all the backpackers go for cheap hostels.;
, Let's say it's a t-shirt. Ask the person how much it costs. Let's say it costs 250 Baht per shirt. Think about how much you will pay for one and how many you want (for example -- you want 5 which would be 1,250 B. You want to pay no more than 200 baht per shirt, which is less than $6 US). Say thank you and leave.
 Make sure you have no other money in that pocket and the exact amount you want to spend. Go back to the shop about an hour later so they don't recognize you straight away. Pick out the 5 shirts you want and ask the price. Pull out the 1,000 note and act sad that you only have that much. Do this when they have the shirts there and ready to be sold, not before you pick them out. Then say you are sorry but this is all you have.
 If they say no, say you are sorry and turn to leave. Very rarely will they let you leave when you are flashing money at them.
 Haggling in Southeast Asiaand Thailand specifically relies heavily on the idea of walking away. If you are not getting the price you want, show your dismay by walking away slowly while telling them it is too expensive. While walking, have the vendors shout at you and be prepared to shout your lower prices back. NOTE: Don't walk away until AFTER you have been haggling for a bit so they know you are interested in their merchandise.

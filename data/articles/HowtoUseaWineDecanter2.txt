 If you are drinking a young, highly tannic wine such as a cabernet or syrah, set an hour or so aside to decant the wine. In fact, most young red wines will benefit from a period of decanting.


Decanting these young wines makes the tannins less abrasive in the wine's flavor, which generally results in a smoother, more nuanced flavor profile.
You can also decant white wines, although an ice bath may be required to keep the wine chilled appropriately. Never place a filled decanter into a refrigerator for chilling, as this will cause the wine to pick up unpleasant odors from neighboring foods.
 To begin decanting a young wine, simply pour the entire contents of the bottle into the mouth of the wine decanter. Allow the wine to breathe for at least 30 minutes before tasting. The wine's flavor will generally improve over the course of several hours.
 When pouring a decanted wine, consider pouring small portions of only 2 or 3 ounces (60 - 90 ml). This will allow you and your guests to refill their glasses often and observe the wine's progression in flavor as it decants.

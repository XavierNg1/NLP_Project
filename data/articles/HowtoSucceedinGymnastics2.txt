 Make friends with the other girls. Many Gym's have classes that start at the same time, but are in different levels. This will mean that everyone in these slots will stretch and warm up at the same time., Many girls talk and socialize during warm up. This is all fine, but make sure you actually feel a stretch or else, you're not helping yourself!, Enjoying yourself is important, but make sure the quality of your skills isn't declining because you want to be funny or make friends., If they give you tips, use them and take them into account. They are professionals and know what they're doing., If you are too scared to do a skill alone, ask for a spot, but don't chicken out completely. But also, don't try something you know you can't do. If you can't do a backhandspring, don't attempt a back tuck., If you are conditioning in the gym, and you are given 25 push ups, don't do 15, do all 25. These exercises will help your skills improve and learn new skills in the long run., Many Gym's offer classes for your level on other days and have Open Gym for anyone on the weekends. More practice on actual equipment will really help you improve.

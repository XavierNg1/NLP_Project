 A common place stretch marks occur during puberty is the cleavage area right between developing breasts. This spot is easy to hide with inconspicuous clothing simply by wearing normal tops cut a little higher. During cooler months, you can look stylish in turtlenecks.


Sometimes it's hard to tell how a piece of clothing will fall on your body. If you're specifically looking for a top to hide stretch marks, be sure to try it on first before buying.
 Stretch marks are also very common at the armpit and upper arms, especially if you exercise or build up muscle in that area. Avoid tank tops and spaghetti straps, which would draw attention to your stretch marks.


When trying on tops with short sleeves, be sure to raise your arm up high in front of a mirror. Sleeves that may look fine with your arms at your sides may ride up, exposing your stretch marks.
 In cooler weather, wear scarves and shawls to cover your stretch marks. Avoid wearing jewelry over bare skin near your stretch marks. The shine from the jewelry will draw eyes to the problem area. Instead, wear your most eye-catching pieces away from your chest, such as on your ears and wrists. If you carry a purse or handbag, pick either a clutch or one with long straps. A short purse held near your armpit will bring attention to your chest area.
 While skimpy bathing suits are popular, there are still plenty available that will cover problem areas on your chest. If you want to avoid looking too modest, find a swimsuit that hides your stretch marks while flaunting another area that you're proud of, such as a crop top. Another fashionable look is to use mesh insets to camouflage blemishes while still showing your skin.

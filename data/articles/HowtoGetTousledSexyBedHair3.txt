 First, use a volumizing shampoo to add body. Try to avoid conditioner: it weighs the hair down, and can impact your hair's ability to retain a certain shape. If you really want to use a conditioner, use a light one. Towel dry slightly so that it is not soaking but still wet.
 Apply a volumizing hair mousse throughout all of your hair. Focus on the roots. Then, twist your fingers and scrunch your hair with the rest. Towel dry the hair to proceed.
 Split your hair into two sections, dividing them down the middle. Spray a heat protection spray all over your hair. Heat up the curling iron and curl your hair.


If you want a looser wave curl, curl larger sections at once.
If you want a tightly tousled look, curl with smaller pieces of hair.
 If you don't want to use heat, use mousse instead of curling your hair. Flip and scrunch your hair. Then, apply a bit of mousse or hair paste to help hold the tousled hair in place.


Be careful: scrunching can cause frizz! Use an anti-frizz spray if you find it helps.
 Apply a shine serum, if you want. Apply a small amount onto your hands and work it through your hair. If you need a stronger hold—say, for a dinner or party—don't be afraid to finish off with some hairspray.

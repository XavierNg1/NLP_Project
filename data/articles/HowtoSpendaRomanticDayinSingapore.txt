 Start your morning with a nice breakfast at Halia Restaurant. This place is situated within the serene, tranquil settings of our Singapore Botanic Gardens. If you're there on a weekday morning, it will be so quiet and romantic - perfect for a couple to talk about sweet nothings. After breakfast, have a short stroll along the National Orchid Garden and work off that meal.;
, Sentosa is Singapore's southern island getaway. You should start off by going to the Carlsberg Sky Tower - where you can get some nice panoramic views of Singapore, Sentosa and the Southern Islands. You can then have lunch at Trapizza, situated at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort. This place is one cool place as it is right smack in the middle of Sentosa's Siloso beach.
 Here, you can check out various forms of marine life, including dugongs. If you don't know what a dugong is, it's a large fish that inhabits the shallow waters of the Indo-Pacific - they are in fact an almost extinct species.
 This place is Singapore's very own tropical garden spa. If you take the 'Two-gether Day Package', you can experience a couple's body scrub and also get a couple Vichy shower. Follow up with a moor body wrap and a delicious light snack. If you want, you can try out the aroma massage and relax in the King's bath, which contains a generous sprinkling of flower petals. Order some champagne too, to end off your afternoon in the best way.
 Go to the Singapore mainland and have a romantic dinner way up in the sky. In the sky? Yes, literally. You can have dinner in a cable car set against the beautiful evening sunset. In fact, if you're thinking of a marriage proposal, now would be the time to whip out that ring and do your thing . When you're done (and hopefully she said yes), you can end the day with some nice cocktails at Equinox (Singapore's highest point).
 The Flyer is the world's largest observation wheel.

 Condescension usually comes from a place of insecurity and fear of rejection. However, by knowing your self-worth, you can feel more secure about yourself. When you feel more secure, you are less likely to put others down.Sit down and make a list of your strengths, weaknesses, accomplishments, and failures. By knowing these, you can assess your self-worth and find you inner confidence, as well as humility. For example, one of your strengths could be that you are highly motivated, while a weakness could be that you are quick to disregard opinions that are different from yours.
If you need help, ask a friend or family member what traits they admire about you the most, as well as which traits they think you need to work on.
 Try to realize that you do not know everything and that your opinion is just that, an opinion. Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, and you shouldn’t look down on someone just because their opinion is different. Instead, have an open mind. Look for similarities between you and others instead of differences.For example, if you have negative views about a religion or a culture, interview someone from that culture. Your intention should be to listen and learn instead of arguing or confirming your suspicions.
 Belittling others ruins your ability to work with and relate to others. It also creates a tense atmosphere where others feel inferior while you feel superior. By monitoring your words and actions, as well as others’ reactions, you can be more aware of condescending language, and its effects.Try to avoid condescending phrases, like, “Oh, you just figured that out,” “Let me see if I can put this in simple terms for you,” “We already thought of that,” or “What she is trying to say is that…”
Instead, say things like, “Maybe I wasn’t clear enough,” “Are you saying that vegetarians are also environmentally conscious?” and “Yes, that is an interesting and valuable point. We are incorporating it.”

 Tea bag style coffee is great when you don’t have any equipment for making coffee. All you need is hot water, a mug, your coffee grounds, a disposable filter, a small length of string, and a spoon.


This style of coffee is made the same way you make bag tea, but instead you make your own coffee bag using a disposable filter.
 Measure out your coffee grounds and place them in the center of a disposable coffee filter. Wrap the coffee filter around the coffee and twist the excess filter closed to create a pouch. Tie the filter tightly with a small piece of string or twine.When the coffee bag is ready, place it into a coffee mug.
 Boil your water in a kettle or saucepan. When it’s around 200 F (93 C), pour the water over the coffee bag in the mug. Let the coffee steep for about four minutes.As the coffee steeps, the grounds will release their flavors and turn the hot water into freshly brewed coffee.
 With a spoon, carefully remove the coffee bag from the mug. Allow the excess water to drip out. Add milk, sugar, or other ingredients and enjoy your coffee.

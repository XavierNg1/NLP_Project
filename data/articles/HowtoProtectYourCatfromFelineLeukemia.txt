 Feline Immuno-Deficiency, or F. I. V., and Feline Leukemia Virus, or F. E. L. V., are dangerous and deadly diseases. They're highly contagious, making identifying these diseases early on very important. Both viruses are spread from cat to cat, and surveys show that up to 15% of sick cats are infected with these viruses. Problem is, even healthy cats may harbor infection and spread the virus to other cats.;
, As they're both very contagious, the feline leukemia virus is one that has high mortality. It's transmitted through direct contact with an infected cat. F. E. L. V. is spread when the saliva or urine of an infected cat comes in contact with another cat. This can happen when cats groom each other, or when they share food or litter boxes.
 There are some simple but important measures you can take to help your pet cats:


Determine whether your cat is F. I. V. or F. E. L. V. positive by asking the vet to do the Snap Test, or doing it yourself. It's available at your local veterinarian, and costs you about forty dollars in the USA. If you're introducing a new cat to your household make sure you test them first, or if you've got an outdoor cat, make sure you test them yearly.
Know the signs of feline leukemia. The signs of F. I. V. and F. E. L. V. are subtle, but very important to recognize. These signs include:

decreased appetite
less frequent grooming; and
an overall decrease in energy.


Test often and avoid exposure to situations where the cat can become positive.

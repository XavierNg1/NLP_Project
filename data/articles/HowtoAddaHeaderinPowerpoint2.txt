 Notes and Handouts headers are limited to text-only.


Choose “Notes Master” if you’d like to view and print your presentation as a single slide-per-page situated above a lined area intended for note-taking.
Choose “Handout Master” if you intend to print the presentation as a series of slides (with no note-taking area) on a single page.
, Choose between “Update automatically” and “Fixed” as a display type. If you choose “Fixed,” type the date in the blank.
 You can also choose to add a footer here (which will appear at the bottom of the notes page or handout) by checking “Footer” and entering your desired information.
 This will add your header (and footer, if you added one) to every printed page. You can return at any time to modify your header settings.
 If you want to move the header to another place on the page, hold your mouse cursor over one of the lines surrounding it until a 4-way arrow cursor appears. Hold the mouse button down and drag the header to another location.


Moving the header to another location on the Notes Master will not move it on the Handout Page—you’ll have to switch to the Handout Master on the Views tab if you want to reposition the header that style of printout.
Footers can also be moved this way.
, After pressing print on your PowerPoint presentation, find the “Print What” area on the print dialog box. It’s set to “Slides” by default, but you can change this to either “Handouts” or “Notes Page.”


If you select “Handouts,” you’ll see options to change the amount of slides per page. The default is 6, but if you want people to be able to read the content on the page, you might want to go with 2 or 3.
For the “Notes Page,” each slide will print on its own page with a series of lines below for note-taking.

 Brown Banded cockroaches grow to be about 5/8ths of an inch long. They are one of the smallest varieties of cockroaches. To put that size in perspective, a Brown Banded cockroach is a little bit smaller than the size of an American penny (not including the antennae of course).;
, Contrary to what you might think, the Brown Banded cockroach is actually named for a yellow band that can be found on the bug. Look for two bands--there should be a very thick one at the bottom of the abdomen, and a thinner band running across the mid-abdomen area., Brown Banded cockroaches generally only live in hotter, drier climates. If you are having a cockroach problem but live in a humid, mid or low temperature climate, you are probably dealing with another kind of cockroach., Brown Banded cockroaches detest the water--as such, they are not often found near any sort of water source. If you have found a cockroach living near your sink or toilet, it is more than likely not a Brown Banded cockroach., Unlike the German cockroach, the Brown Banded cockroach will fly off if disturbed. If you notice a small cockroach flying through the air, chances are it is a Brown Banded cockroach.

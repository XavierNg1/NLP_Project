 Some people dislike the texture of very smooth soup. If you want something slightly chunkier, add more of the chunkier ingredients. Additional celery and tomatoes, for example, can make soup chunkier. You can use the "pulse" button to mix in the added ingredients so the soup does not become too much like liquid., If you have a very powerful blender, you do not need to heat the soup after blending it. With powerful blenders, 90 seconds of blending at a high speed will heat your soup. If you want your soup hotter, you can continue heating it in the blender instead of heating up over the stove or in the microwave., If your soup does not come out as hot as you want, and you don't want to blend it further, you can add a little more hot water. Tossing in another half cup of hot water can heat the soup up without damaging its texture too much.

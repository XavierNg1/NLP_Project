 Try to focus on Adam's music instead of his love life. Listen to his songs, watch videos of his performances, or see him in concert to remind yourself of his talent. The fact that he is gay does not change his music, even if it changes the way that you approach his music.

When you read his lyrics, you don't need to think about Adam with another guy. Instead, let his lyrics lead you to think about your own feelings and experiences. Music is meant to make you feel things, not necessarily to make you think about the artist.
 Remember that his sexuality does not define his worth. He is as deserving of love, respect, and admiration as anyone else., He didn't make a big show of his homosexuality when he was on American Idol because he didn't want his personal life to steal the spotlight from his music.He wants his fans to appreciate him as a musician, not necessarily as a "gay musician." Ask yourself whether being a "gay musician" is any different from being a musician.

Consider this analogy. Imagine that you are a devout Christian, and also an amazing artist. Would you want someone to pass over your art for the sole reason that you are Christian?

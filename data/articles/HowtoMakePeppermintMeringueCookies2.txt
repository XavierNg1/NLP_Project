Preheating the oven will prevent the cookies from collapsing., Place the egg whites in the bowl of a standup mixer, with a whisk attachment in place. If you are using a hand mixer, place the egg whites in a large metal, or glass, mixing bowl. Turn your hand or stand mixer to low and begin whipping the egg whites. Gradually increase the speed to medium until soft peaks begin forming. This process will take about 2-3 minutes., Increase the speed of your hand or stand mixer to medium high. Gradually add the sugar to the mixture, 1-2 teaspoons at a time.

Turn the speed of your hand or stand mixer up to the highest setting. Whip the ingredients together on high until the mixture appears glossy. Stiff peaks should form when you lift the whisk attachment from the bowl. This process should take a total of 4-5 minutes., Place the crushed candy canes and chocolate chips in the bowl. Run a rubber spatula around the sides and then along the base of the bowl. Fold the mixture onto itself. Repeat these motions until the candy canes are combined with the egg mixture., Scoop the mixture up in a heaping teaspoon. Drop the cookies on to parchment paper lined baking sheets.

patio example: 12' x 12' patio with slab 4" thick

12' x 12' = 144 Sq. Ft. x thickness.

;
, Examples:


6" thick would be .500
4" thick would be .333
3" thick would be .250 Etc.



12 x 12 = 144 x .333 = 47.952 Sq. Ft. This is now converted to Cu. Yds.
A cube 3' x 3' x 3' is one cubic yard. Take 3'x 3'x 3' = 27 cubic Ft. per cubic yard.
 Ft. / 27 Cu. Ft. to reach the Cu. Yards needed.
 Yds.
 The industry standard is to add 1⁄4 yard (0.2 m). to all material orders. You do not want to be short on your concrete order.


In this case your initial order amt. would be 1.776 Cu. Yds. + .250 or 1⁄4 yard (0.2 or 0.2 m). for a grand total of 2.026 Cu. Yds. The importance of using all of the decimal points is illustrated in this case scenario.
As you can see the 2.026 Cu. Yds . in the total amt is not necessary as part of your final order because you have over ordered by 1⁄4 yard (0.2 m). This will compensate for the 2.026 yards (1.9 m). Your final order amt. would be 2.0 Cu. Yds.

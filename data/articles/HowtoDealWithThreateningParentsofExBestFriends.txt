 While some parents go wrong in involvement, keep in mind that some may have the right intentions. Did you break up over something trivial? Are you still not sure whether or not you want to be friends? Or, may it be better to forgive, forget and move on?;
, It's possible your ex-friend did go wrong and now, his/her parents simply want the best and support him/her. Maturely talk to your own parents, as it is unwise to attempt handling this alone. Tell them about the fight and why you cannot be friends, and about parental involvement.
 They can explain something along the lines of, "Without wishing to get involved in whatever happened, I would just like to say I believe our kids are old enough to make their own decisions, and if they don't want to be friends, then we need not get involved." Having a parent on your side can strengthen your case.
 Often, in such cases, the parent of the ex-friend can be very scary to you, and appear threatening. Keep a calm mind and remember that they likely will stop.
 Sometimes, the parent(s) of the person you just broke up with can go crazy and take it to a new step. They may start coming into school and talking to you, threatening you, etc. Don't get your parents to do this as well, it will only worsen the situation. Calmly tell this parent, "I am really not interested in being friends. Please stop harassing me."

, If this person seems threatening, take all precautions and stay in well-populated areas of the school. Let your teachers and principal know about the problem, and make sure to tell your parents.

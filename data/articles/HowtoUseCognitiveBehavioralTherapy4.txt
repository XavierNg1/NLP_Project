 Breathing exercise can help you to cope with stressors, triggers, and automatic negative thoughts. While relaxation techniques may not "get rid of the problem," it is important to learn how to focus your mind and energy constructively to avoid anxious or obsessive thoughts. Consider this abdominal breathing technique:Place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen.
Exhale with your mouth, and take a slow deep breath in with your nose.
Inhale as deeply as you can and hold for 7 seconds.
Slowly exhale through your mouth for 8 seconds.
As you release the air with relaxation, contract gently your abdomen to remove the remaining air from your lungs.
Repeat this cycle for a total of 5 deep breaths. Try to have rate of one breath every 10 seconds. This helps both your heart rate and your mind.
 This is another relaxation technique that starts with deep breathing, but focuses your mind on how to release muscle tensions the body. This can help relieve anxiety. It can be done with the guidance of a mental health or holistic health professional.Focus on deep breaths, and notice your breathing.
Focus on tensing and releasing muscles in the body for five seconds each.
Focus your mind on your body parts, starting with the feet. The progression is feet, legs, pelvis, stomach, back, arms, neck, and face.
 These techniques can help you redirect your negative thoughts or stressors to something peaceful and safe. They can help you when triggers for maladaptive thoughts occur. You can also do these at night before bed. Your peaceful place can be somewhere you have been before, or possibly dreamed about. Visualize this way:Close your eyes, and imagine a peaceful or happy place
Notice the colors, shapes, movement, light and textures of this place
Listen to sounds around you that emerge
Notice smells in this place
Focus on any sensations of touch such as the floor or earth beneath you, the temperature, or anything you can touch.

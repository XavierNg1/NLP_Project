 Combine the peanut butter and butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for two minutes, removing the dish halfway through the cooking time to stir. When the fudge has cooked for two minutes, remove it from the microwave and stir it again.You can use either crunchy or smooth peanut butter to make this fudge. Crunchy peanut butter will leave some small chunks of nuts in the fudge, whereas smooth peanut butter will result in a completely smooth and creamy fudge.
 Add the sugar and mix the fudge with a wooden spoon or hand mixer on medium speed. Scrape down the sides as necessary, and keep mixing until all the sugar has been fully incorporated into the fudge.

You can also add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla to the mixture at this time if you like.It’s important to use confectioner’s sugar, because granulated sugar will give the fudge a grainy texture.
 Grease an 8-inch (20-cm) baking pan with butter, cooking spray, or oil. Pour the fudge into the greased pan. Spread the fudge evenly around the pan with a wooden spatula., Transfer the fudge to the refrigerator and chill for at least two hours. This will give the ingredients time to cool and allow the fudge to set. Once firm, cut the fudge into squares or slices and serve.Transfer leftovers to an airtight container. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for about two weeks.

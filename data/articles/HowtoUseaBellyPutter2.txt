 Rather than having two hands placed together low on the grip, one hand will anchor the club against your belly, while the other swings the club. The first three fingers of your non-dominant hand should be on the front of the club, your pinkie will rest on the back of the club, and your thumb should be on top.Your thumb will be the anchor against your belly as opposed to the shaft in the first method.
 Fully extend your arm to grab the grip of the club, leaving a slight bend in your elbow. Your hand should be as far down on the shaft as possible, as opposed to near the top by your other hand. You can hold the club as you would any other with your knuckles wrapped around the back and your fingers in front.


Another option for positioning your hand is to hold the club loosely with your fingers on the front and your thumb on the back of the club.
 This is different than when you use a traditional putter, moving both shoulders during the swing. Using only your dominant hand on the shaft, pull the club backward to the desired spot for the swing, then complete the pendulum motion swinging the club forward.The club is held anchored to your body with one hand and swung with the other hand, allowing for a smooth motion without twisting of the wrists.
 When you are first gripping the club with your non-dominant hand, hold the shaft between your middle finger and ring finger. Use your index finger and thumb to pinch your shirt. This gives you a slightly more fluid anchor point than when the shaft is tight against your stomach.You still want the anchor to be steady and not move around during the swing. It may be a little harder to perfect than the tightly anchored version, but it does allow for easier movement.

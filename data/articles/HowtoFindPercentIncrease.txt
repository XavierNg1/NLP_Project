 This will require two numbers that indicate the same statistic or topic, usually gathered at two different dates.;
, A simple calculator on a phone or computer will also do.
, Subtract the original number from the increased number.


For example, write on your piece of paper "the new amount" - "the original amount." If you had 12 job prospects in 2007 and you have 64 job prospects now, then the actual increase would be 52 job prospects.
 You may want to use your calculator to get an accurate number.


In our example, you would take 52 and divide it by 12. The answer in decimals would be 4.33.



You will want to keep between 2 and 7 decimal points in your decimal answer. The larger your change is, the more likely you will need extra decimal points for an accurate figure.
 This is how you convert a decimal to a percentage. This percentage is your percent increase.


For example, with our figure, you would multiply 4.33 times 100 to get a percent increase of 433 percent.

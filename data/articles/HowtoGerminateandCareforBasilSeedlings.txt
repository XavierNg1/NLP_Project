, You can use newspaper cups. Spray it with water to make the soil moist to the touch.
 Too many seeds will make the basil feel crowded not germinate. Basil seedlings are extremely tiny and have a hard time finding their way to the surface of the soil if covered with soil, so leave them uncovered.
, Basil will usually sprout on the third day or anytime after. Only spray the soil with water when the soil is dry to the touch.
 After the seeds have germinated or sprouted, it is important to spray them daily to keep the humidity levels healthy inside the container.
 The first two leaves that appear on basil (and every other seedling) are called "cotyledons". Cotyledons are actually part of the basils embryo. They help feed the plant nutrients because the seedling can not yet photosynthesize.


The 2nd set of leaves that look very different from the cotyledons are known as the "true set of leaves". These leaves will photosynthesize for the plant.
 The longer you leave the basil seedlings in their container with humidity the better. Most basil seedlings will die because they are transplanted to soon. A perfect time to transplant them is when they have their third set of leaves.


Before transplanting basil, a way you can double check that they are strong enough to be transplanted/moved out of the container with humidity is by opening the lid. Let all the humidity out of the container and leave the plants for a while. When you come back to check on them they should look as you left them. (If the basils bend or keel over put the lid back on and they will recover.)

, When basils are transplanted, watering is an important key to their survival. Anytime the soil is dry give the plants about an inch of water. Don't pour the water directly on them because they can be damaged easily.
 The basil should not come across any pests, for example pests like aphids dislike their strong smell.
 Add some dirt around the base so the basil doesn't fall over easily.

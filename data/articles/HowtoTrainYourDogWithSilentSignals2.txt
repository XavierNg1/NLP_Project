 You may want to select treats that are small to avoid giving your dog too many extra calories and to keep him motivated. If the treat is large, then you can cut it in half or quarters. It is important to only give your dog small rewards to keep him motivated. Otherwise, he may wander off to enjoy his treat and lose interest in continuing the training session.


Pea-sized treats are ideal because they will add only a few calories and your dog will want more, so he will probably be more willing to work. You can even try giving your dog a single piece of his dry food as a reward., To keep your dog motivated, you will also need to reduce the frequency of the treats. Otherwise, your dog may expect a treat every time he obeys a command and the treats may become more like a bribe than a reward.Start giving him treats every other time he performs the command, and work up to only giving him a treat at the end of the session.
 Keeping training sessions short will also help to ensure that your dog complies with your commands. If you train your dog for too long, then he might begin to lose interest or become frustrated.


Try to keep the training sessions at around 10 to 15 minutes, or less if your dog has a really short attention span.
 Giving and reinforcing command often will also help to ensure that your dog gets the most out of the training sessions. Try to train your dog every day. You do not have to train him in the same place or at the same time, but training him every day will increase the effectiveness of the training.


Training your dog in different rooms of your house as well as outside is also a good idea because it will reduce the chance that he will associate the commands with a single location.

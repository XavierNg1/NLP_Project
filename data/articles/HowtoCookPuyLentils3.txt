 Pour the lentils into a heat-safe bowl and add enough boiling water to cover them by an inch (2.5 cm). Set the bowl aside and let the lentils soak in the boiling water for about 15 minutes.

This will par-cook the lentils so they’ll be tender when the soup is done., Pour the oil into a large stockpot and heat it over medium heat for two minutes. Add the onion, garlic, leek, salt and pepper (to taste), thyme, and cumin. Cook the vegetables and spices for about 20 minutes, stirring regularly.

When the onions and leeks are tender, add the celery and carrots. Cook for another 10 minutes, stirring regularly., Strain the lentils and add them to the pot with the vegetables and spices. Add the stock and the tomato paste, and stir to combine all the ingredients. Put on the lid and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. When the soup boils, reduce the heat to medium and remove the lid.

Let the soup simmer on medium heat for an hour, until the lentils are tender. Stir the soup every 15 minutes to prevent burning., When the lentils are tender, add the final ingredient. Taste the soup, and add more salt and pepper, to taste. You can also use an immersion blender to puree a quarter of the soup and give it a thicker consistency.To use a blender, transfer about 2 cups of the soup to a blender. Puree the soup and stir it back in with the rest of the pot.
 Serve the soup as soon as you’ve seasoned it to your liking. You can drizzle each serving with a bit of olive oil if you like, and garnish the top of each bowl with some freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

 Magnesium sulfate, or Epsom salts, is a cheap source of magnesium that you can feed your horse. You can find large quantities of it at most farm supply stores. However, because the horse will only absorb a small amount of magnesium from Epsom salts, you will need to feed them more of it. In turn, this increases the risk of your horse developing diarrhea and dehydration.Talk with your veterinarian before administering any supplements.
 This mineral will give you the most bang-for-your-buck when it comes to magnesium supplements. Unlike Epsom salts that deliver a small amount, magnesium oxide has a much higher magnesium concentration and, therefore, provides your horse with more of the mineral. This means that a little of the compound can go a long ways. However, it is very bitter, so you will likely have to mask the flavor.Try mixing magnesium oxide with salt for the best results.Consider mixing the magnesium oxide with applesauce or molasses to hide the bitter taste.
 This magnesium supplement is twenty percent magnesium and highly water-soluble. This means that you do not need a lot, and what you use will be quickly absorbed through the lining of your horseâ€™s intestines. This is a higher end horse supplement, so you might want to evaluate whether it is worth using over cheaper options.

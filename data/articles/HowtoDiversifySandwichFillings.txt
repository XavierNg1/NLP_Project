 While cheese sandwiches are an easy mainstay for lunchboxes, they can be made a lot more interesting than just simple cheese. Here are some ideas:


Change the cheese. If you've been eating only one kind of cheese, branch out and try other cheese varieties, especially those with stronger flavors, and cheese types you've never tried before.
Red pepper, cress, or radish to mild cheese for a piquant taste.
Chives and tomato to ricotta cheese.
Sprouts and a spread to cheese.
Cottage cheese with blackcurrant jam.
Cheese with lettuce, tomato and green or red pepper.
Cheese and celery.
Mixed cottage cheese and cream cheese, with sprouts added.
Cheese with chives and tomato.
Add banana and jam.;
, Peanut butter is another sandwich mainstay that can do with a lift. Some suggestions include:


Lettuce and cucumber with peanut butter.
Lentil sprouts and parsley with peanut butter.
Semi-dried, oiled tomatoes or red peppers with peanut butter.
 Honey can make an interesting spread choice, with some additions:


Honey with cocoa, Milo, malt powder.
Honey with chopped raisins. Warning: Very sweet!
Honey with poppy seed or sesame seed.
Honey, jam, and apple slices.
 This can include any vegetables that are your absolute favorites and it will taste delicious in Italian style breads, such as ciabatta. Good choices for inclusion include pepper, zucchini (courgette), potato, pumpkin, eggplant, artichoke hearts, sweet onion, and tomatoes.

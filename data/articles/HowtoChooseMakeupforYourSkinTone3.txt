 You may need to switch foundations from summer to winter depending on whether your skin is slightly darker in summer months.
 The best place to test foundation is on the skin between your lower cheek and jawbone. Foundations are either yellow-based or blue-based. Some make-up lines actually have words like "cool beige" or "warm honey" on their labels to indicate the tone it was made for.


Choose a cool color foundation with blue or pink undertones if you have a cool skin tone.
Select yellow-toned foundation for a warm skin tone.
If your skin is darker, be sure that the foundation does not make you look ashen. If so, try a different color or a yellow-based foundation.

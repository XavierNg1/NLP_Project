Put the sansevieria plant in an east, west or north windowsill any time of the year. If it's a south-facing window, place the plant about one foot from the window, to the side, year round. (This advice is directed at the northern hemisphere.)
Provide bright fluorescent or other lighting. This will provide enough light so that the sansevieria plants grow well.

By hand: Let the pot surface feel dry to the touch before watering in spring and summer.
 Wait until the pot is quite dry before watering.


Water if you notice the leaves are drooping and the pot feels dry.



Use room temperature water.
Use distilled or rainwater if possible. If using tap water-- allow it to stand for at least 48 hours to dissipate chlorine, fluorides etc. If possible, one week is better.
 Try to keep water out of the center of the leaf clump. Water until water drains from the bottom and empty drained water from trays promptly.



Fertilize in spring with a 20-20-20 fertilizer mixed in a watering container.

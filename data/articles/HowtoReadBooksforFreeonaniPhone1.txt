 There are a couple great options out there when it comes to free E-Book Reader Apps like Stanza and Kobo but the best choice for those readers looking for an extensive collection of free books is Wattpad. The Kindle Unlimited app is another great resource of free books, but you will be required to pay a membership fee.;
, Once you have chosen your app, you can download it from the App Store on your phone. Click on the "Get" and then "Install" buttons. Wait for the app's icon to become fully colorized and then select your app to open it.
 Make sure it is your current E-mail address because you will need to access it in order to confirm your account.
 Wattpad will now ask you a series of questions about your age, gender, reading preferences, and how you would like to connect with friends on the app.
 Once you have created an account on the app, you will need to verify it by going to your E-mail and opening the message entitled "Welcome to Wattpad! Oh, and one more thing..." If you do not see this message, check your spam folder or recreate your account through the app., This will verify your account and you may return to the app and get started reading.
 You can search for stories by selecting the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner. Within Wattpad, you can also connect with friends, stay up-to-date with the news, access your bookshelf from any device, and even write your own stories that you can share with your followers and contact list.

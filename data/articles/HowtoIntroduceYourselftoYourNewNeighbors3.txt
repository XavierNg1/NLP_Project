 When you first move into a new neighborhood, it’s a great time to establish your willingness to participate in local activities. If you’re asked, let people know what you might be willing to do. Attending an occasional block party or neighborhood meeting will help you meet people and show them that you care about what’s going on in the neighborhood., A Neighborhood Watch program is a great opportunity to get to know others and show them that you want to be supportive of your community. It’s also a way to prevent crime, reduce fear of criminal activity, and build pride in your neighborhood., If you have a Community Clubhouse in your area, it probably offers a variety of activities throughout the week. Social events and classes are a great way to connect with others in your neighborhood.
 If your neighborhood has a Homeowners Association (HOA), take time to learn about it. Consider volunteering or joining so you will know about rules and regulations that are effective in your neighborhood. Show up at some meetings to find out what it’s all about. It’s a great place to socialize and meet lots of your neighbors in one spot., Check online for a community website or Facebook page to find out about local news and events. If your neighborhood doesn’t have one, think about starting one yourself. You might be just the one to bring the neighborhood together!

The marks on the thimble usually go to 50, and each line represents a hundredth of a millimeter or .01 mm.
The horizontal lines above the scale on the sleeve will measure to the thousandth of a millimeter, or .001 mm.
 If the last line you saw were a 5, then you would have 5 mm thus far.
 If you have one mark that would be .5 mm.


Don't count a mark that is barely showing; the reading on the thimble might be getting close to 50. , If the line on the thimble reads 33, then you'd have .33 mm.
 In this example, add 5 + .5 + .33. The measurement is 5.83 mm.
 If the thousandths read a 6, then at .006 to the measurement. In this example, it would be 5.836


The main time you should incorporate the thousandths measurement is if the object has less tolerance for the pressure applied by the micrometer.

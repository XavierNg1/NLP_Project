 As soon as you enter Gerudo Valley, you'll notice the bridge to the other side is not guarded, as it was when you were a kid, but broken. Fortunately, you can either jump across the gap with Epona or, if you've completed or attempted the Water Temple, Longshot across. You'll see an old man with a gray beard. He says that his carpenters have been captured by the Gerudo.;
, You'll see a huge fortress, guarded by Gerudo. Walk up to one of them and get caught.
 Look up and Longshot to the wood. You'll be standing in a window. Either jump down and time it right before a guard sees you, or shoot the guard with an arrow to knock her out and then jump down. Either way, jump down and enter the Thieve's Hideout.
 Suddenly, a Gerudo will drop from the air and present you with the Gerudo Membership Card. Now you can freely roam about without the guards throwing you in jail.
 Climb the ladder and speak with the Gerudo lady. She'll open the gates with a clap of her hand, so now you can enter the Haunted Wasteland.
 When you're ready, enter.
 If you don't, you'll be lost and spawn at the entrance to the Haunted Wasteland and lose a precious heart. Now, Longshot to the boxes across the quicksand.
 Climb on top and look at the grey platform. Use the Lens of Truth and suddenly a Poe will appear. He'll guide you the rest of the way through the Haunted Wasteland.


Optional: There's a man floating around on a carpet. He's selling Bombchus, which you'll need later on in the Spirit Temple.
 If you go northeast, you'll find the cavern that leads to the fairy who gives you Nayru's Love.
 She teaches you the Requiem of Spirit, meaning you can now warp straight to the Desert Colossus without crossing the Haunted Wasteland.
, When you beat the Iron Knuckle, step outside of the boss room to receive the Mirror Shield.

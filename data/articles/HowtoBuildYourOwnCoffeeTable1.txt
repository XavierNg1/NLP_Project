 One of the surest ways to make your DIY coffee table unique is to repurpose a piece of salvaged material for the tabletop. An old door can be sawn to size for this purpose, as can a piece of wood salvaged from an old building.;
, Some furniture stores sell ready-made desktops and tabletops in several standard sizes. Buying a top like this will help make your DIY coffee table an inexpensive and easy project. Tabletops in solid wood can even be stained or painted to suit your preferences.
 Many home improvement stores will cut wood boards to size for free upon purchase. This option will give you the most control over the exact dimensions of the coffee table without even having to make any cuts yourself.

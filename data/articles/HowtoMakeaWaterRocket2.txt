 You can use another kind of food can or a piece of PVC piping as well. Just make sure it is the right width for the bottle rocket to be able to sit snugly on it, with the neck of the bottle (the bottom of the rocket) facing down. This will serve as a launch pad for your rocket.
 You will stick this stake down into the dirt to stabilize your rocket launcher, so it should protrude 0.5’ – 1’ down off the can. Be sure to tape it firmly in place.
 Use the thinnest drill bit you can find. This hole needs to allow the needle of a bicycle pump to fit snugly into the cork and come out the other side, so that you can pump air into the rocket.Artificial corks work best for this, as real ones tend to crumble.The cork will likely be too long, and need to be trimmed down a bit to allow the needle to go all the way through., Thread the nozzle of the bike pump up through the can, so that it comes out of the top. Push the needle of the bike pump’s nozzle through the hole in the cork.

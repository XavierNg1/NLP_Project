 Listen actively when your boyfriend tells you about his mates. Pay attention to anything you might have in common with them. When you talk to them, say something like, “Oh, you’re Mike! Josh tells me you’re originally from London. My aunt lives there.”, Sitting on the sidelines while the guys kid around only makes you look stuck-up. If you don’t understand a joke one of his mates tells, wait until they finish laughing. Then, calmly say, “Sorry. I didn’t quite get that. Did I miss something?” Smile and chuckle a bit as you talk. This should show them that you’re a good sport and can take a lighthearted joke.Don’t let your boyfriend or his mates get away with picking on you or telling sexist jokes. If they can’t treat you with respect, they’re not worth hanging out with.
 Suggest this only for times when you’re hanging out with them. In a smaller group, it’s often easier to put names with faces. Reassure him that this is only until you get to know his mates better.


If any of his mates are seeing anyone, suggest a double date. Getting to know another couple in his social circle will make future get-togethers less awkward., While you’re working on accepting his mates, suggest that he work on accepting yours. Invite your mates to the weekend get-together. This way, you’ll each have someone to speak up if there’s an awkward pause or change the subject if someone says something offensive.

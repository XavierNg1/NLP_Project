 An electronic fitness tracker (usually in the form of a watch that you wear on your wrist) can be an excellent way to track your heart rate. In addition to keeping track of your daily steps taken and activity levels, most of these trackers also keep record of your sleeping patterns, heart rate, and even allow you to log in your calories consumed.Each model of fitness tracker comes with a variety of features. Make sure the one you purchase has a heart rate feature before you buy it.
Some of the most popular fitness trackers with heart rate monitoring include the Fitbit Charge 2, the Garmin Vivosmart HR+, the TomTom Spark 3, and the Garmin Forerunner 35.
 There are a variety of heart rate monitors on the market. While the fitness trackers may be the most popular, they arenâ€™t necessarily the most accurate. You can try a band that goes around your chest to monitor your heart rate for the highest levels of reliability.You can even consider arm band monitors, earphone monitors, and headband monitors.
 If you are concerned about your heart rate, the most accurate way to measure it is by letting a medical professional handle it. Make an appointment to see your doctor and tell them what symptoms you are experiencing that are causing you concern.Your doctor may check your heart rate with a stethoscope in your chest, using their fingers on your wrist, or by placing a finger sensor on the tip of your finger.

 Find a temperature display. Look for a public clock on a building such as a bank. Many public clocks also display the temperature below the time. Ask someone to tell you the temperature if you cannot locate a thermometer or temperature display.
 Use a calculator or simply multiply the numbers in your head. Either way, you want to double this number.
 Calculate 10% by multiplying the number by 0.1. For example, 100 x 0.1. = 10. Subtract this number from the number you doubled in the first calculation. Use a calculator to perform these operations for best results.
 Take the doubled number and add 32 to it. Make use of a calculator or perform the addition in your head. This will give you a semi-precise temperature in Fahrenheit.For example:


Determine the temperature in Celsius: 20 degrees
Multiply this number by two: 20 x 2 = 40
Determine ten percent of this number: 40 x 0.1 = 4
Subtract this number from your number in step two: 40 â€“ 4 = 36
Add thirty-two to this number: 36 + 32 = 68 degrees Fahrenheit

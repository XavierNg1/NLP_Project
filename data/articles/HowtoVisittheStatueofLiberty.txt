, Ferries leave from Battery Park City and from Liberty State Park in New Jersey from 8:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. The cost is $12 for adults, $10 for senior citizens, and $5 for children who are 4 to 12 years old. Children under 3 are free.
 Statue of Liberty security screening will take place before arriving at Liberty Island. This screening procedure is similar to the security checks done at airports before passengers get to the boarding gate. Visitors will be checked for weapons, and any bags or purses will be inspected. There will be a second screening process for anyone visiting the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty, or the Statue of Liberty crown. Leave enough time for this process. During the monument's busy months of April through August, wait times can be up to 90 minutes.
 There is an observatory where visitors can look up into the inner base of the statue. There is also a museum, which can be entered with the same ticket used for the ferry ride. The museum holds the original Statue of Liberty torch, and guided ranger tours as well as audio tours are available.
 Tickets to the crown cost an additional $3. Tickets to visit the crown are restricted to parties of 4 people or less, and advanced reservations are required. Children must be at least 4 feet (122 cm) tall to take the steps to the top, and a guest may only visit once every 6 months.

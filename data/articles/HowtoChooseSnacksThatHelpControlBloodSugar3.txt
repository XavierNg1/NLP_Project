 A smoothie is a wonderful way to add extra servings of fruits and vegetables into your diet. It’s a snack that is satisfying and can help you control your blood sugar when you get into an afternoon slump. Try blending together 1 cup of water, 1 cup of spinach, ½ banana, and ½ cup mango., Kale is rich in vitamins and minerals, and can be a great snack. Try snacking on homemade kale chips. You can make them by baking kale tossed in olive oil at 300 degrees Fahrenheit or 149 degrees Celsius for about 25 minutes., A great way to work your greens into an afternoon snack is with a salad. Try tossing 1-2 cups of greens with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. Top the greens with chopped veggies like red peppers, zucchini, and carrots. Finish off the salad with a sprinkling of walnuts, sunflower seeds, or shaved almonds.

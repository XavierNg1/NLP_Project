 Choose a cooler spot in the room, by a fan or air conditioner, to keep the ice bucket during the party. Avoid spots in direct sunlight and place your cooler in a shady area under a tree or the covered area of your deck. Don’t put the piping hot macaroni and cheese dish next to the ice cooler or the flaming BBQ plate next to your ice bucket.The ice will absorb heat from the atmosphere around it, so make sure you put it in a spot where it will have minimal to no contact with heat or warmth.
 The ice packs will help to keep the container nice and cold, thereby ensuring your ice doesn’t melt until the end of the party.If you are using a large cooler, you can also use frozen plastic bottles of water or other drinks that are not carbonated, to act as ice packs. Place them among the ice to keep the cooler frosty.
 This will ensure there is always fresh ice in the container that is keeping the container cold and preventing the rest of the ice from getting too warm.If you use a good insulating container and larger ice cubes, you likely will not have to check on the ice very often as it will stay cool on its own.

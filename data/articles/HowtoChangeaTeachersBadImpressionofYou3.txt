 If you feel that your teacher’s bad impression of you is unfair and unlikely to change, you need to tell an adult whom you trust. They may or may not be able to intervene, but it’s important to seek support and have someone on your team.Tell your parents the details of what has gone on, so that they have concrete facts and incidents to consider.
Your parents may choose to have a meeting or phone conversation with your teacher. While this may seem scary or embarrassing, it can help your teacher to understand that you do want the relationship to change and that it’s important to you.
 If you have a strong social network, your teacher will see that. It will also help you to feel more comfortable with yourself, which will likely result in you feeling more comfortable in class. This can help you give a better impression because you’ll be able to act authentically, which is something most teachers appreciate.If the friends they see you with are good students whom the teacher respects, that is likely to help influence your teacher’s impression of you.
 If you don’t feel comfortable talking to your parents, make an appointment with your school’s guidance counselor. The counselor is a person who’s neutral and is there to be on your side. Your meeting with them should be confidential and cannot be held against you in class.The counselor should be able to offer some advice or guidance and may even be willing to facilitate a conversation between you and your teacher.

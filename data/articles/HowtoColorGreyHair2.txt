 If you are trying to get a consistent, even hair color, but you are currently salt and peppered, you likely need to lighten you hair first. This is especially important if you hair is dark in patches. Use a bleach or blonde hair dye first and let it set in before moving on to your desired color.


Know, however, that bleaching your hair causes damage. Although, you will not need to bleach it with every coloring.
 Use a gentle shampoo and rinse off your hair well. Check your specific dye to see if you should dry your hair as well -- some require damp hair to start.


Let your hair air dry if possible -- this prevents damage to the hair that could lead to a more difficult coloring.
 Make sure you hair is straight and free of tangles, as this will make it easier to apply the dye.
 Use a bobby pin or your comb to break your hair off into at least 3 small sections. This makes it easier to apply the dye evenly and consistently, and prevents you from missing any sections.
 Once you've mixed together your dye, use the brush to apply it to each section of hair. Go slowly, being sure to coat each bit of hair evenly. This is when the sections come in handy -- more sections ensures you get every bit evenly.


If you needed to use bleach or blonde dye before dying your hair, put it in and let it set for 5-10 minutes, then rinse it out and begin with your desired color.
 At the very least, buy shampoo and conditioner specifically formulated for "Dyed or Treated Hair." This ensures that your color is long lasting and your hair is healthy. Immediately after applying the dye, you will likely need to wait as it sets in, then rinse it out to see how it looks.

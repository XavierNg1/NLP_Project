 This is fun, figuring you can do about anything to your horse. They can be a pegasus, unicorn, dragon/horse hybrid, demon, wolf/horse hybrid, etc.


You will need to fill in the following information: Name, rank, gender, species, appearance, mate/crush etc. Experiment a bit. Think outside of the box, trying something different than your usual character preferences.
Your horse's name must be a double name (two names combined). Leader's names should end with 'tail', apprentice's names should end with 'hoof', foal's names should end with 'foal' and Pegasus names must end with 'wing'.;

Some major Clans are RiverClan, FireClan, DragonClan, CoyoteClan, StarryClan, MossClan, IvyClan, PolarClan, FeatherClan, Clan of the Hawthorn Bush, Clan of Whispering Willows, and finally, the Rouges of Cascaded Darkness.
You could make your own but you need at least four members to do so.
 Alternatively, go to warruorcatsrpg.com and go to 'Horses' and search Clan of the River RP thread. If you are LARPing you will need: a territory that stretches for at least half a mile in all directions; a main camp complete with leader, scouts, warriors, hunters, herbal horse, fading hooves (elders), apprentice dens, prey, a nursery, other people to RP with, and anything else your little growing clan needs. Try to get other friends to start their own clans with which you can battle, raid or assist.
 They believe in MoonClan, which is like heaven to them. They are noble, strong horses and have different personalities and traits depending on their Clan. Be loyal, steer clear from No-tails, any clans your Clan is enemies/alliances with, treat them the way they should be. Also, if you are in Clan of the river, don't make your horse deathly afraid of fish or water. Stick to your Clan's skills, abilities, and traits.
, Maybe put flyers in the park, near stores, in school and other places, if you are not embarrassed by the idea of other people thinking it is stupid.


Start turning down requests to join. Show people around the camp and let them see the info pages about your clan before they join to see if they like it. If you aren't sure about accepting them, have them do a sample role play with another member or yourself.
Deputies can also decline and accept members, take the clan on patrols, organize meetings with LARPers, and take charge if you can't come to meetings. You should pick two deputies, even three, just to be safe.
 You can also claim part of the school playground as your territory.

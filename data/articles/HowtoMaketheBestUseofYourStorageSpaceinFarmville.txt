 This will enable you to that you can rack up those experience points quickly. It's important to buy the items that you think will add the most aesthetically to your farm, as well as considering experience points.;
, Storage is needed to stop creating a cramped environment. You'll quickly find that no matter how good the items you buy look individually, it's hard to make them all look good when they're jammed together. This is because there is simply no space left to display the items properly. So that's when you'll need to take advantage of your storage buildings.
 The amount of space you have available for storage will depend on the number of storage buildings you have. How many you have will depend on how much space you have to put up those buildings. With a little careful planning, you can make this arrangement work out thoroughly to your advantage.
 The buildings all look like they belong on a farm, so don't feel as if they'll spoil the overall appearance of your farm.


For example, you can use a barn or a shed as a storage building.
 Putting up the buildings will get you a good measure of experience too, so they actually benefit you in a couple of ways.
 You can put up extra buildings to store more stuff as you accumulate it. But at a certain point, you'll have to start choosing what to store and what to sell off. After all, the whole point of having storage buildings is to create some extra space on your farm. You don't want to just turn around and fill up that space you worked so hard to create. You'll be able to buy most items again if you want them later on, so the best ones to store are generally things that are seasonal in nature and won't be available to purchase the next time you want to be able to display them.

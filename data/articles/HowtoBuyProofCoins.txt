 Proof coins differ from bullion and uncirculated coins in that more care goes into their manufacture to give them a more detailed appearance, and they are produced in smaller quantities than either bullion or uncirculated coins, making them inherently more valuable. Other differences are described below:


Proof coins are struck using specially acid-treated and polished dies, sometimes using manual instead of automated presses. Proof coins are struck at least twice and sometimes more often, with the coin planchets (blanks) specially washed and polished before being struck. Because of the special handling, proof coins cost more than either bullion or uncirculated coins.
Bullion coins are struck in the same manner as coins made for general circulation, although they are struck in precious metals such as gold, silver, or platinum. They are made purely for their investment value, which is determined by the weights of the specific precious metals they contain. Bullion coins may be bought for the market price of the metals they contain, plus an additional transaction fee, and then resold at a higher price when the market value of the metal goes up.
Uncirculated coins are simply coins that have never been placed in circulation. They are struck once with production dies, and while their appearance shows none of the wear of coins in circulation, they are nowhere near as detailed as proof coins. Some uncirculated coins designed for collectors are struck on specially treated blanks, often with a matte rather than a frosted or polished appearance.;
, Proof coins can be broken down into 3 types: frosted proofs, matte proofs, and brilliant proofs.


Frosted proofs have frosted images and lettering set on a polished, mirror-like field. U.S. proof coins issued prior to 1936 were of this type. Today, the first 15 to 20 coins struck from new dies appear frosted, but the frosting can disappear after the dies are repolished. Chemical treatments to the coin planchets before striking can enable more frosted proofs to be struck, however.
Matte proofs in U.S. coins were issued chiefly from 1908 to 1916, with some of the Peace silver dollar proofs of 1921 and 1922 also of this type. Matte proofs have a finely etched, "sandblasted" surface.
Brilliant proofs have an overall brilliant appearance, both on the coin's raised image and the surrounding field, and sharp details. Many proof coins issued after 1936 struck on repolished dies are of this type.
 U.S. coins often bear a 1- or 2-letter mark indicating the location of the mint at which they were struck. Certain mint locations specialize in proof and bullion coins, while others produce coins for general circulation. A list of mint marks appears below:


P � Philadelphia. Proof coins minted prior to 1968 were minted here. Today, the Philadelphia mint produces circulation and commemorative coins, as well as coin dies. (U.S. coins without a mint mark were also produced in Philadelphia; the "P" was first used during World War II.)
D � Denver. Established in 1904, the Denver mint produces the largest number of circulation coins, as well as coin dies. (This mark was also used on gold coins minted in Dahlonega, Georgia from 1838 to 1861.)
S � San Francisco. Established in 1854, the San Francisco mint began producing proof coins in 1968 and now produces exclusively proof coins.
W � West Point. Although not given official status until 1988, West Point has produced coins since 1937. It produces primarily gold, silver, and platinum bullion coins, but also some proof coins.
C � Charlotte, North Carolina. Produced coins from 1838 to 1860.
O � New Orleans. Produced coins from the mid-1840s to 1904.
CC � Carson City, Nevada. The Carson City mint operated from 1870 to 1893 and was best known for minting Morgan silver dollars.
 Coins are graded on the Sheldon scale, with numeric values ranging from 1 to a top value of 70. Proof coins include the designation "PR" or "PF" with the numeric grade, while uncirculated coins include the designation "MS" (for "Mint State"). A proof coin should grade at least PR 60, showing that it has been handled properly. PR 70 proof coins are rare or may even be nonexistent, depending on the coin in question.
 After being struck, proof coins are placed in plastic cases called slabs to protect them from damage. U.S. proof coins that are certified as well as slabbed are those coins that have been graded to the standards of the American Numismatic Association and display the grades on their slabs. Recognized coin grading companies that have been in operation since the mid-1980s include the Professional Coin Grading Service (PSGS), the Independent Coin Grading Company (ICGC), and the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC).
 Recent-issue U.S. proof coins can be bought directly from the United States Mint, either from its website or by telephone; other countries' mints may offer similar options for their recent-issue proofs as well. Older proof coins can be purchased through various brick-and-mortar or online dealers, or through online auction sites such as eBay.

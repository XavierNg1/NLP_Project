 Students have limited time. That means you may not be able to spend a long time meditating. However, you can do a short mini breathing meditation in just a few seconds. This meditation technique can be used anywhere at anytime.Take a moment to stop whatever you are doing. Either step aside or sit down somewhere.
Take a deep breath in through your nose. Hold it as you count to five. Exhale slowly. Repeat five times.
To make sure you are breathing correctly, look at your lower abs. Your lower abdomen should expand outward as you inhale and go down as you exhale.
 The relaxing breath exercise is a basic breathing meditation technique. You can take a moment to perfect this breathing technique anywhere.Start by sitting with your back straight. The tip of your tongue should be resting against the roof of your mouth right behind your teeth. Keep your tongue there, even when you exhale through your mouth past your tongue.
Exhale to get out any air. Then, close your mouth. Inhale slowly through your nose for a count of four. Hold the breath as you count to seven. Exhale completely through your mouth for a count of eight.
Repeat that three times. You should complete four breaths in all.
 Breath counting is slightly more difficult. For each cycle, you should only count to five. Donâ€™t let yourself count beyond five. Each time you get to five, start back at one. Do this focused breathing meditation exercise for 10 minutes.Sit in a comfortable position. Make sure your back is straight and tilt your head forward slightly. Close your eyes and sit there for a moment breathing naturally.
Exhale and count to your head one. Inhale slowly, and when you exhale, make a mental count of two. Continue repeating this until you hit five.
When you hit five, start a new cycle. Exhale and count one. Repeat until you hit five.
Repeat for 10 minutes.

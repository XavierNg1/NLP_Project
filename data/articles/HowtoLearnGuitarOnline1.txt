 It's very easy to skip one day of practice, then skip two, then skip three, and then ten years have gone by and your guitar is just gathering dust in the closet. Schedule some time each day to practice (at least half an hour). You'll thank yourself later.
 Don't waste time during practice trying to decide what to work on next. Schedule out some time for each of the options below, if you're going to try to teach yourself guitar from online resources.
 While it's admirable to learn guitar online and be self-sufficient, it's not always the smartest way to learn guitar. If you're unsure about something, ask! Learning techniques in the wrong way could create bad habits in your playing that are impossible to get rid of later, and stop you from progressing further.

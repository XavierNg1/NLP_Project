 Heat plain sesame oil in a dry skillet for a few minutes to toast it. This draws out more dimension in the flavor of the oil.


The pan must be completely clean before you add the oil.
Warm the pan first over medium heat before you add the sesame oil.
Make sure that the oil is constantly moving in the pan as you toast it.
When ready, the oil should turn golden brown and take on a nutty odor.
 Whisk the two ingredients together in a large bowl until well combined. Let it sit for 5 minutes before pressing forward.


The wasabi powder needs time to absorb the lime juice. It will turn into a thin paste, which will be much easier to mix into the remaining dressing ingredients. If you do not let the wasabi soak up the lime juice first, you may have trouble getting it to dissolve later.
 Add the sugar, sauce, red chile powder, ginger, fish sauce, toasted sesame oil, and cooking oil to the wasabi and lime juice paste. Whisk well to blend.


Make sure that all the sugar is dissolved before continuing on.
 Taste test the dressing with a clean spoon. If it needs more of a kick, you can add another splash or so of lime juice.
 Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until you are ready to mix it into your coleslaw.


Fold your coleslaw mix into the dressing, thoroughly coating all the vegetables with dressing.

 They will understand that you are only learning. Remember to tell them you're learning so they can slow down.
 Check the Internet for games and videos that can also help you learn Spanish while making learning more fun.
 Avoid your phone, your classmates, or any other distractions and make sure you are focused on your teacher.
 If you're in an immersion class and you don't know what your teacher is saying, then you can say, "Lo siento, Señor/Señora, pero no comprendo," ("I'm sorry, Mr./Mrs., but I don't understand") to show that you don't understand what's going on. Before you ask, though, look at your teacher's actions to try to get some context for what's going on.
 Look over your notes from class to refresh your memory.
 Go over the vocabulary for the class, focusing on the words you can't remember or don't know. Writing them down with the definition and translation helps. Whenever you get nervous, review the paper. Feel free to review the paper before the test.
 If your teacher allows it, asking what a word or instructions mean can help you do better on the test.

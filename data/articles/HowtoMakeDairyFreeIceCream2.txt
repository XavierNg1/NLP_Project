If you are making mint chocolate chip ice cream, use only 2 bananas. All other flavors will require 3.
 Bananas are sweet on their own, but not everyone likes their taste. You can change the flavor to a certain extent by adding some additional ingredients. Here are some ideas to get you started:To make chocolate ice cream, add ¼ teaspoon of vanilla extract and 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder.
To make mint chocolate chip ice cream, add ⅛ teaspoon of peppermint extract. You can also add a drop or two of green gel food coloring.
To make strawberry ice cream, add 1 cup (200 grams) of sliced, frozen strawberries and ⅛ teaspoon of vanilla extract.
To make vanilla ice cream, add ½ teaspoon of vanilla bean paste or ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract.
 From time to time, you may have to pause the blender/food processor, and push any lumps or clumps down towards the bottom with a rubber spatula. Keep blending until everything is evenly mixed together.
 At this point, your ice cream is done. You can step it up by adding in some extras, however. Toss in some chopped nuts, chocolate chips, or sprinkles, and gently fold them in with a rubber spatula.


If you are making mint chocolate chip ice cream, you might want to stir in a handful of chocolate chips (dark chocolate or vegan).
If you are making strawberry ice cream, you might want to stir in a handful of diced, frozen strawberries.
 At this point, the ice cream is ready as a soft-serve style. If you want it to be more firm, transfer it into a freezer-safe container, and leave it in your freezer for 30 minutes.

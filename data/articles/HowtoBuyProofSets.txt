 After allowing collectors to purchase proof coins and occasional proof sets from it, the United States Mint began marketing proof sets from its Philadelphia branch to coin collectors in 1936. Proof sets were available until 1942, when World War II forced a temporary end to their minting. Production resumed in 1950, then ended again in 1964. "Special mint sets" were issued for the next 3 years, then proof sets were issued again, this time from the San Francisco mint, from which they continue to be issued.


Because they were issued as special requests, proof sets from years prior to 1936 are extremely rare.;
, The types of proof sets that are available depend on the year the coins were issued.


U.S. proof sets from 1936 to 1942, from 1950 to 1972, and from 1982 to 1998 include the cent, nickel, dime, quarter, and half dollar.
Proof sets from 1973 to 1981 include the coins above, along with the Eisenhower or Susan B. Anthony dollar.
Prestige Proof sets, sold from 1983 to 1997, included commemorative coins, while sets sold since 1999 include the 5 state quarters issued that year, and Legacy Proof sets, sold in 2004 and 2005, included the nickel designs commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Lewis and Clark expedition.
The metal content depends on the year of issue. Proof sets issued prior to 1965 featured dimes, nickels, and quarters with 90 percent silver content. The special mint sets issued from 1965 to 1967 included dimes, nickels, and quarters clad with 40 percent silver. Proof sets issued since 1992 are available in either silver or the metals used for circulation coins.
 Coins are graded according to the Sheldon scale, with the coins in poorest condition graded as "1" and those in the best condition graded as "70." Proof coins also include the prefix "PR" or "PF" in the grade to indicate they are proof coins. You want coins in the proof set to grade at least PR 60 or better, although the top grade of PR 70 is exceedingly rare and in some cases nonexistent for some proof set coins.
 Older proof sets originally came wrapped in cellophane, while proof sets issued since 1966 come in hard plastic cases called slabs. These cases better protect the coins in the set from damage than did the cellophane. In some cases, older proof sets have been transferred from cellophane to plastic, but the coins in such sets may have discoloration from fingerprints, breathing, or tobacco smoke.


Proof sets issued from 1950 to 1954 came in square boxes, with the coins in cellophane holders wrapped in tissue. Proof sets issued from 1955 through 1964 came in cellophane holders inside sealed brown envelopes, while the special mint sets of 1965 replaced the brown envelope with an unsealed white envelope.
 Recent-issue U.S. proof sets can be bought directly from the United States Mint, either from its website or by telephone. Older proof sets can be purchased through either brick-and-mortar or online coin dealers, or through online auction sites such as eBay.


Check the dealer's experience in selling coins, as well as his or her readiness to answer questions. For those selling coins through auction sites, check the feedback ratings as well as any positive or negative comments left by previous buyers.

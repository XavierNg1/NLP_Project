 Another option is to allow someone you know and trust to use the car and make payments to you which you then use to make your lease payments. If you are considering this option, you should approach trusted friends and family who might be interested in taking over the lease., Before you consider this you should check your leasing contract to see if such an arrangement is expressly forbidden. Simply allowing someone to take over your lease contract without the involvement and approval of the leasing company is likely to violate your contract.If you have a trusted family member lined up to take on the lease, the company may look on the proposal more favourably.


Speaking to the leasing company can help you decide whether to transfer the ownership completely by putting the lease in someone else's name.
If you do this the new lease holder will have to be checked and approved by the lease company.
The alternative is to keep the lease under your name and have the other person pay you directly, but this may breach your contract, so be sure that you are clear.
 This more informal arrangement comes with inherent risks that you should understand. If someone is using your car and making payments to you, you essentially become a creditor so if the person stops making payments to you, you will have to repossess the car. This can be difficult and complicated. You will still need to make the payments on the lease regardless, so you are exposing yourself to risk.Any damage to the vehicle will see its value depreciate and push you into negative equity.
If you own the car, you will need to add the new driver onto your insurance, which will likely raise the premium. If you do not, the driver will not be covered, which is often illegal.
Due to these risks you should carefully consider the risks before embarking on this kind of arrangement.
Think about the trustworthiness of the person, as well as his ability to make the required payments to you.

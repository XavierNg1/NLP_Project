 Hemp twine is the basis of the jewelry and it can be found in either an authentic tan color or in any other color that you desire to use. Most jewelry is made using 1 mm or 20 lb twine. However, thicker twines are made, and if you prefer a thicker one, then that will work just as well. Of course, the thicker the twine, the thicker the jewelry will be. Beyond the twine, the only other materials that you will need are based on your preference of whether you want to add beads or charms.
 Knot the 4 strands hemp together with an overhand knot, leaving 2 inches (5.1Â cm) at one end.



Most hemp jewelry uses basic macrame knotting techniques like the half knot. To do a half knot, cross the left side strand loosely over the other 3 strands, so it looks like the letter "L." Bring the right-most strand on top of the left-side strand, then tuck it underneath the 2 center cords and up through the space between the left side strand and the center cords. Hold the center cord taut as you gently pull the 2 outer cords snug against the previous knot. This is called a left half knot; doing the mirror-image process, starting with the right side cord, creates a right half knot.
Do a chain of same-side half knots to create a spiral cord, or alternate right and left half-knots so your hemp chain lies flat.
You can also use the classic "friendship bracelet wrap" to create a knotted hemp cord. Cross 1 side strand loosely over the other strands as if you were beginning a half knot. Then bring the end of that same side strand underneath the middle strands and up through the space between the side strand and the middle strands, almost like a figure-4. Hold the middle strands taut as you gently tighten the wrapped side strand against the previous knot.
 Tie at least 1 knot, using the outside-edge cords, between each bead.
,, Sliding the 2 knots apart automatically tightens your jewelry piece.

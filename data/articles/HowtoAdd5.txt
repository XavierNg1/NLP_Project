 If you have only a few numbers to keep track of, but the numbers don't fit well into sets of 10s, you can add or subtract numbers to make it easier to add in your head. For example, let's say you need to add 19 + 30. It would be much easier to add 20 + 30, right? So add one to the 19! All you have to do is take the number that you added away again in order to get the final sum. So: 19 + 1 + 30 = 50 and 50 - 1 = 49.
 Similar to the pairing of numbers that was discussed in the first section, try to find groups of numbers that add to either 5 or 10 (or 50, 100, 500, and 1000, etc). Add the groups together to make things easier.


So, for example, 7+1+2=10 and 2+3=5, so if you had to add 1+2+2+3+7, you'd get 15.
 Break up ones and tens to make the numbers easier to count, adding together the tens and then just worrying about the ones. For example, for some people, it might be easier to add 40+30+10 and then 2+5+7, instead of 42+35+17.
 If you just want to quickly add in your head without making columns and the grouping methods don't work for you, you can use the shape of the numbers themselves to count, instead of relying on your fingers. This is best if you only have a handful of numbers to count up though. For example:


The number 2 has two end points. Same with the number 3.
The numbers 4 and 5 have their respective number of end points and conjunctions, with the round curve of the 5 counting as one conjunction.
Some numbers like 6, 7, 8, and 9 are less obvious. The curve of the 6 and 9 get counted as three points (top, middle, and bottom) and get counted twice for 6 and three times for 9. Each side of each round on the 8 gets counted as 1 (4 total), which gets counted twice to get 8. The 7 gets counted with 3 points for the short top side and 4 points for the longer side.

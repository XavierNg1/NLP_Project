 Again, if you want to make your life easier or you've never trimmed meat before, stick with PSMOs instead of buying your tenderloin unpeeled. The process of trimming can be quite tricky if you don't know what you're doing.


On a PSMO tenderloin, simply cut into the fat and/or silver skin. Lift up a piece with your hands and safely begin cutting away more as you continue to lift up the flaps of fat and silver skin with your fingers. Continue until all noticeable fat and silver skin has been removed.
 Cut the chain, which is fattier and tougher, off from the rest of the loin. Freeze and save for later.
 Wrap and save for later. The chateaubriand is a great piece of meat and can be used it any number of dishes.
 Do this especially if you've never cooked tenderloin before, or if you're only serving a few people. A whole beef tenderloin is about 6 pounds (2.72 kg), or enough for about 10 people.


Place one cut portion of tenderloin in the freezer or refrigerator to cook later. Again, tenderloin keeps very well as long as you thaw it slowly in the refrigerator.

 Your list is composed of a bunch of different items that have no relationship to each other.
 If you have a very large number of things to remember, this will be unwieldy; for this reason, the chaining method is best for shorter lists of hard-to-remember items.


Chaining is great for a limited number of items in an arbitrary list without any seeming relation to each other (for instance, the list tree, bird, keyboard, bottle). It's hard to apply a strategy like chunking because there aren't any real categories to break stuff down.
 This is the fun part of this method: the more outlandish and weird your sentence or image is, the easier it will be to remember. For instance:



Peanut butter and espresso bean sandwich wrapped in ethernet cable with a screwdriver going through it.
 You'll use your sentence or image as a key that will bring up what you've memorized.



Peanut butter and espresso bean sandwich wrapped in ethernet cable with a screwdriver going through it=
peanut butter, espresso beans, bread, ethernet cable, screwdriver bit

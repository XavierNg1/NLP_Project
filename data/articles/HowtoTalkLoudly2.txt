 Perhaps you feel self-conscious about speaking in front of people. Maybe you are uncomfortable with coming across as assertive or confrontational. Analyze your own thought patterns, and consider that you may need to work on more than just your speaking voice.
 Own your words, and don't be afraid of what anyone else thinks. Notice when you are being hesitant, and check the impulse in yourself. Try to overcome a fear of judgment.Try not to apologize or hedge the things you say. If you are always hesitating, then you won't speak as loudly as you are able.
Speak to a person as though he or she is your equal, not your superior. Try to suppress low self-esteem and "fake it until you make it."

, When you are having a conversation or speaking with a group of people, try to speak at roughly the same volume that they are. Be aware of the energy of the conversation. Speak loudly when the energy is high, and speak softly when the energy is low. You don't always need to speak loudly to be heard!

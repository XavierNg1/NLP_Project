 Throw some poison at him and charge at him.
 Behind them and charge them down.
 From a distance, once you think they are low on health, ender pearl down, and finish them off by sword.
 If they try attacking you switch to a diamond sword (which you will have in your hotbar, obviously) and finish them off.
 Once the battle is nicely going, jump out of nowhere and finish off your enemy, if your enemy sees both of you they are going to run, if they see one person with bad weapons and swords, they are going to attack, not expecting you to come out of nowhere.
 If you have a sword with knockback, try pushing them off a mountain or into lava.

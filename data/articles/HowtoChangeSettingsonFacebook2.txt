 This is a dark-blue app with a white "f" on it. If you're logged into Facebook, opening it will take you to your News Feed.


If you aren't logged into Facebook on your Android, enter your email address and password and tap Sign in to view the News Feed.
 It's in the top-right corner of the screen.
 This area is close to the bottom of the menu. You'll see several different settings options here:



App Settings - Change your Android's Facebook app settings such as whether or not Facebook audibly notifies you when a new post appears while you're using the app.

News Feed Preferences - Change the types of posts you typically see in your News Feed, or unfollow people.

Account Settings - Most of the settings you will feasibly want to change live here. You can change anything from your name to your account's security settings.

Payment Settings - View your Facebook payment information like your registered cards, transaction history, and security settings. You can also add or remove payment methods from here.

Activity Log - View and, if necessary, remove things like comments, posts, and likes.
 This will open the respective menu, allowing you to view and, if necessary, alter the settings in your selected menu.


In some cases, you will need to tap a confirmation button of sorts (e.g., SAVE or OK) for your changes to take place.
You may need to close and restart Facebook for some changes (e.g., name or other profile changes) to display.

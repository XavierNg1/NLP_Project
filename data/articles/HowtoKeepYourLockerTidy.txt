 Try tidying your locker after school or during school.;
, This means you should always put back things where they belong. This will obviously make your locker neater and more organized.
 Wrappers, soda bottles, and etc. Put trash items in a trash can or in the recycle bin. Don't leave them lying around because that isn't good for the environment.
 Try the little square ones and put them at the bottom.
 Whenever you have a lesson, you probably go to your locker and just shove your books in, get the books out for next period, then shove them in again. This is just like a cycle of messiness. Take your books out (yes all of them) and order them in a neat pile. Or, you could make a certain order which your books go in or even (depending on how big your locker is) make half a shelf for a couple of subjects each.


Each class has a textbook. Period one textbook goes first, then second period textbook, and so on. This will help you locate your books and it helps you remember the order.
 You should be able to grab them along with your textbooks.
 Try putting it up with a magnet, so it sticks.
 Such as: deodorant, a hairbrush, and extra clothing.
 You can't go with your backpack everywhere!

, To personalize your locker, you could have posters, magnets and even accessories made specifically for lockers, such as mini chandeliers. These things may fall off or get in the way, so use a generous amount of blue tack and cello tape.
 Always remember to shut your locker. If you leave your phone out, this is not a good idea, as people could look through your locker and steal it, along with any other valuables.

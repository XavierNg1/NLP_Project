 To create a leather cuff, you will need strips of tooled leather, leather glue, a leather needle, waxed linen thread, and a button snap or clasp for the ends of the bracelet.
 Use a ruler to measure a strip of leather 2 inches (5.08 cm) wide, by the length of your wrist plus one inch. Cut the leather to size with a pair of sharp scissors or utility knife.
 Attach your cut and sized leather to a larger, tooled piece of leather with leather glue. Use your fingers to smooth out any wrinkles, and allow it to dry overnight. Adding a second layer of leather to your bracelet will give a more finished look.
 Trim the edge off the tooled leather to make it the same size as your original strip. You should now be left with a nearly completed double-sided leather strip.
 Use a leather needle and waxed linen thread to stitch the cuff together. Any stitch is appropriate; the stitching is simply securing the edges of the leather and giving a more sophisticated look.
 Use your needle and thread or the leather glue to secure your clasps to either end. With the completion of this step, you're finished!

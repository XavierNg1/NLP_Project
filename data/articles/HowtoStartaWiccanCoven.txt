 How many people do you want in your coven? Who are possible candidates? What will you achieve in your coven? Will there be a hierarchy or will there be full equality? Write down as many questions as you can about your new coven, leave them for a few days and then come back and answer them.;
, Seek your coven members, assemble the coven's grimoire, start planning your first gathering.
 They could already be in an exclusive coven, or they might wish to stay solitary, respect their choice.
 Perhaps you want a uniform for during rituals and meetings? Maybe you could start a collaborated apothecary? Anyone for scary Tuesday afternoons? There are endless possibilities, but don't argue too much.
 If someone says they don't want to do something, they may be uncomfortable with it and by forcing them to do it will give you a bad name. Never make anyone do dangerous or just plain stupid things to get into your coven. Respect everyone and everyone will respect you.

 Candles, herbs, crystals, etc. They're always good to have around, donate some to the Treasury if you have spares you don't want. These are good to have in case someone forgets something for a ritual.
 Decide which Sabbaths and Esbats to celebrate. Write some charges or rituals to do with the coven. Perhaps someone can bake some special food for the celebration.

 A passing compliment to a female friend, work colleague, or peer on her dress or appearance might be fine in a professional setting. However, you again need to be mindful of the context and also your mutual level of comfort.


It is best to be close friends with the girl before you compliment her on looks, in order to avoid possible misunderstand or complication.
Schools and workplaces nowadays are careful about maintaining a safe environment and don’t take kindly to sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is any “unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.”Your compliment might be friendly and good-intentioned, but could be perceived as unwelcome or aggressive by another. Be sure that your friend is comfortable with you.
 Avoid misunderstanding by all means possible. Make sure that your friend realizes that you are just offering her a nice, friendly, brotherly compliment and doesn’t think that you are interested in more. Tone and body language are key.


Make sure that your tone is casual and gentle when paying the compliment.
Consider complimenting her in an indirect way – a way that says she is pretty without necessarily directly referencing her appearance.It is also important that your body language is non-aggressive. Don’t lean in too much and respect her personal space. Don’t move in too closely, in other words.
 Let the compliment come out naturally in the course of conversation. Say, “I like your new sweater. You look very pretty in it” or “You’re looking very lovely and in high spirits today!”


After paying her the compliment, proceed about your normal activities and continue working.
A compliment that does not focus directly on appearance might be something like “You light up the room with your smile.”

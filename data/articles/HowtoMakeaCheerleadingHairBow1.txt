 If you are using 2 different colors, cut them both to 1 1/2 feet (.45 m) long, but cut two sections of one. If you are using 3 different ribbons, cut them all to be 1 1⁄2 feet (0.5 m) long. Also cut a 3 inch (7.6 cm) piece of any of the ribbons for the middle of your finished hair bow.









Don't worry about cutting your ends yet; we'll do that near the end.;
, Do it as fast as possible so it doesn't dry. If you can, have someone else helping you -- four hands work faster than two.









You probably don't want to get the glue on your carpet or nice counter top. Set down some newspapers or use a surface you're not worried messing up.
 Press down cautiously and wait to dry. Try to get it as straight as possible -- you want each color to be displayed equally.









If you have only two colors, be sure to have the odd color out in the middle.
 Do it fast! Pin down the ends of the first ribbon if you're worried about it moving.
 Be careful while you press down as to not burn yourself. You should now have a tri-toned piece of ribbon, in all your school's colors (or whatever colors you want).









Now the ribbon is complete and you can move onto forming the bow!

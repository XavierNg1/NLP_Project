 Strawberries are like sponges that soak up every bit of moisture, and the more water they soak up, the more quickly they'll spoil. If you wash the strawberries and then put them in the fridge, then they'll spoil much more quickly no matter what methods you use. You can wash them if you plan to store them in the freezer, but take care to get rid of excess moisture or they'll get too icy.

, Mold spreads easily, so you should remove any moldy strawberries as soon as you buy them. If you store the fresh strawberries with the moldy ones, the mold will spread and they'll spoil quickly. One bad strawberry can spoil the whole batch. You can try to avoid this problem at the store by picking the freshest, brightest strawberries you see.









Place the strawberries on a clean surface and sort through them to find the moldy ones. Avoid touching them too much.
 If you're planning to use the strawberries for a recipe in a few hours, or if you know you'll be eating them as a snack by the evening, you can store them at room temperature to retain their fresh taste.
 Though most store-bought strawberries are packaged in these containers, they aren't ideal for storage. Tupperware is far more durable. The plastic containers won't let in any air and will make the strawberries spoil faster.

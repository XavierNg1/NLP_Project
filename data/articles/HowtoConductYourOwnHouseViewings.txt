 First impressions count and it is vital your home is in the best condition possible when potential buyers come to view your home.  Sweep the driveway and make sure the front of your house is tidy and inviting. If you have a parking space, move your car somewhere else and keep it available for viewers to use when they are visiting. You don’t want to give potential buyers an instant negative impression whilst trying to find somewhere to park their car.;
, From the moment you decide to sell, you should refrain from smoking indoors. Smoke infiltrates furniture and carpets and leaves a nasty smell. You might not smell it, but a non-smoking viewer will be put off. Definitely do not smoke inside on the day of a viewing!

, Viewers may be allergic to the hair or scared of dogs, plus the smell of animals can put off some viewers. Make sure you clean up any hair and hide the food bowls and bedding.
 Freshly baked bread can provide a nice homely smell. However, a strong curry smell can be off putting for some viewers.
 Sunlight will immediately brighten the property and create the illusion of space. In darker rooms ensure you keep the lights on. If you have under cupboard lights in the kitchen put them on to make your kitchen appear brighter.
 A nicely maintained garden could be the icebreaker in securing that all important offer.
 Always be polite and courteous.
 Show them around the property, but do not overload them with details. Do not point out any negatives but do mention the occasional positive. If someone is interested then they will ask you questions. Once you have shown them around invite them to take another look alone.  Stay on hand to answer any further questions.
 Viewers may ask what how much your energy bills cost or if the property is ready for cable television.
 If you are not comfortable with negotiating face to face, then inform them that you will contact them later, as you have other viewings already booked and do not want to make any promises.

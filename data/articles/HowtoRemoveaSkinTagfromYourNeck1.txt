 Probably the easiest way to get rid of a skin tag is to ask your doctor to remove it. This can be done quickly, right in the doctor's office. The doctor will first clean around the tag with some alcohol, then use a sterilized scissors or scalpel to snip it away.


Small tags will be removed without an anesthetic, and will be no more painful than a mosquito bite. If you have a large tag or multiple tags in the same area, the doctor may apply a numbing cream or use a local anesthetic before removing.
The skin tag may bleed a little at first, but will usually heal within 24 hours.;
, A very effective method for removing skin tags is to have them burned off with an electric cautery at the doctor's office. This will cause the skin tag to turn black and fall off almost immediately.


Unfortunately, most health insurance providers consider skin tag removal to be a cosmetic procedure, so you will need to cover the cost of this treatment yourself.
The exception is suspicious looking or symptomatic skin tags, which may be covered under your health care policy., Using a similar method to cauterization, you can also have skin tags frozen off with liquid nitrogen in a procedure known as cryotherapy. Cryotherapy is also used in the treatment of other undesirable skin conditions, such as warts and moles.


Cryotherapy treatment is also considered a cosmetic procedure and will not be covered under most insurance policies.
Cryotherapy may leave a slight discoloration on the skin after the tag has been removed, but this should fade over time., Keep in mind that skin tags are completely harmless and it is not necessary to remove them for health reasons. If the skin tag on your neck is small and not causing you any irritation, you should consider simply leaving it alone.

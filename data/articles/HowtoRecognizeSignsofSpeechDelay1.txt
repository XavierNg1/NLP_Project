 When your child is born, you should hear them crying. They will cry often during their early months of life, especially at night, when they might wake at odd hours in order to cry. After two to three months, the baby will cry in response to irritation and discomfort. When they see you (their parent), however, they will coo.If your baby doesnâ€™t cry regularly in their earliest months of life, they might have a speech delay.;
, During their first year, your baby will move from random babbling to more structured babbling. For instance, when the baby is 3-4 months old, they will babble randomly. At 5-6 months old, they will babble more rhythmically, perhaps in short sentence-like bursts. After your baby is 6-11 months old, they will babble even more closely in imitation of speech and use facial expressions to emphasize what they are babbling about., Children with normal speech development can use a larger number of hand gestures than children with speech delays, who use relatively few hand gestures.For instance, at age one or two, your child should be able to wave goodbye, point at things they want, and point in order to draw attention to things.

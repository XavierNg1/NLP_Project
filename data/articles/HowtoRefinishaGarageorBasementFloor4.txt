 Stir the mixture for 1 more minute before beginning.


If you want an anti-skid surface, add the anti-skid granules during the last 1 minute mixing time. Anti-skid additives are a good idea for floors that may get wet from foot traffic and snow-covered tires.
 Paint all the edges, then work in sections until you have the entire surface covered. The top coating is a milky color when applied, but it dries clear.

 In order to apply for a volunteer position, you will need to fill out an application form. These forms will ask a number of questions including:Name, address, phone number, date of birth, education, employment information, volunteer experience, availability, etc.
 Most volunteers also have to provide the hospital with the contact information for two to three references. These references should not be family members or close friends, unless you have worked for them in the past. In some cases your references are expected to fill out a form answering questions about you. In other instances the hospital will contact the reference and ask them a few questions about you.Choose references that will speak highly about your work ethic, reliability, friendliness, and professionalism.
For example, you could ask a current/former boss, employer, or volunteer coordinator that you have worked with.
Always notify your references before you include them in an application. This way they will be expecting the hospital to contact them.
 Most hospitals interview potential volunteers before accepting them. This allows the volunteer manager the opportunity to get to know the applicant and assess them in person. In order to prepare for the interview, you should make sure that you have all of your required documents completed. You can also create a list of questions that you would like to ask during the interview.For example, you may want to ask “What does the training program entail?”, “Can I request to work in a specific area of the hospital?”, “Do baby cuddlers require any additional training?”
Arrive for your interview on time and dress in a professional manner.

 In particular, watch out for the memory card (whether it is a CompactFlash, SD or MMC card). Handle them with care because they are small and delicate.
 In my Canon PowerShot S500, the panel for the USB connect and the battery is a tad flimsy. Make sure to handle it with care whenever you open it.

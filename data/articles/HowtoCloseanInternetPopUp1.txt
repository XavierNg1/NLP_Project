 Some ads do a good job of hiding close buttons and links in busy images, so you may not notice it at first.


It may be more difficult to find a close button on devices with smaller screens.
If you see a message that says “Don’t show more alerts for this webpage” (or something similar), place a check into the box provided. This should stop pop-ups from recurring.;
, If you didn’t see an “X” to close the pop-up, there may be a link like this elsewhere on the pop-up.


Try not to click anywhere else on the pop-up. Clicking through a pop-up ad could bring you to an unsafe website.
 If an image on a pop-up doesn’t load, your browser may display a small placeholder square where the image would be. Try clicking that box to close the window., If there is no close button or link, or if clicking the button or link doesn’t work, try closing the tab or window.

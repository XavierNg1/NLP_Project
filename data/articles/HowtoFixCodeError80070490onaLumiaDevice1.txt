 Tap the gear icon from the application screen of your Lumia to open its device settings. Inside the Settings menu, you’ll find all the customizable options for your Windows phone.;
, Scroll down the Settings menu and tap “Email + Accounts.” This should list all the email accounts you currently have synced with your Lumia.
 Choose the email account you’ve used to sign up for Microsoft store. Once you’ve found the email address you’re looking for, tap and hold its name from the list, and press the “Sync” option that will pop up on the screen of your device.
 After tapping the Sync option, an “Attention required” notification will appear on the phone screen. Tap this notification and select “Verify Email Account.” Select the email address where you want to send the verification message to (it doesn’t have to be a Microsoft email), and a verification message will then be sent to the email account.
 Open the email account you selected earlier, either from the web browser of your phone or from the Outlook application (if you’ve previously set up the email account with the Outlook app on your Lumia) to view its messages. You’ll find a verification email sent from Windows Live inside the Inbox.


Open the email from Windows Live, and select the “Verify Email Account” link on the body of the message. This should verify the email address you’ve used to sign up for the Microsoft Store and fix the code error 80070490.

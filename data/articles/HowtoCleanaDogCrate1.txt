 Washing a crate can be messy. The best place to wash the crate is outside. That said, if you are unable to go outside, choose a room with tiled floors, such as a kitchen or bathroom. It should be well-ventilated so that the cage can dry without mildewing. Make sure that the dog is nowhere near the crate as you clean it. Keep him in a separate room., Dogs can handle most types of bleach or cleaning solution, as long as the crate is dry once they use it again. Ammonia, however, smells like urine to dogs, and it may encourage them to pee in their crate.You can also make your own cleaning solution from products around the house. In a bucket, combine the ingredients and stir. After mixing your solution, put it in a spray bottle to make cleaning easier. There are a few different solutions you can try:


Half a cup of bleach to a gallon of water.One part dish detergent to ten parts water.
Half a cup white vinegar to one gallon water., If your dog had an accident, you will need to remove any solid clumps of feces before you can clean the rest of the crate. Place the feces in a plastic bag, and throw the bag away immediately. If your dog sheds, you may find large clumps of fur in the crate. Make sure that you have either swept, dusted, or vacuumed the crate.

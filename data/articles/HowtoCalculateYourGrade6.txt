 You may wish to convert the percentages you have calculated to a letter grade. Alternatively, you may wish to know the percentage of a particular assignment where your teacher provided only the letter grade. The letter grading scale varies greatly depending on where you are going to school but this is the most common.


A = 93 - 100%
A- = 90 - 92%
B+ = 87 - 89%
B = 83 - 86%
B- = 80 - 82%
C+ = 77 - 79%
C = 73 - 76%
C- = 70 - 72%
D+ = 67 - 69%
D = 63 - 66%
D- = 60 - 62%
F = 0 - 59%

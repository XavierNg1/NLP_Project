 In a large workbook, there may be only one or two sheets you want printed. In Excel, go to the “File” menu and select “Open” or simply double-click an Excel file.
 Click the sheet name in the bottom bar. Multiple sheets can be selected using Ctrl + click (⌘ Cmd + click on Mac).
 The menu is in the top left corner of your screen and brings up “Print Settings”.
 The first option below the selected printer device is a dropdown menu to select which areas of the workbook to print. “Print Active Sheet(s)” will set the printer to only print the sheets you selected instead of the entire workbook.
 Dropdown menus below the selection menu allow you to adjust layout options like page orientation or margins from this panel.


If you previously set a print area but decide against using it, select “Ignore Print Areas” to ignore.
 The button is located at the top of the menu and your selected sheets will print, excluding the others.

 The “species” of a cloud is a deeper classification if it’s characteristics. For example, a cloud in the floccus species would look puffy. Clearly, not all families of clouds could have a member in this species (it actually applies only to Cirrus, Cirrocumulus, and Altocumulus clouds). , Cloud subspecies go one step further in the description of a cloud. For example, a cloud in the subspecies opacus would appear dark, or opaque, in the sky. Like cloud species, not every family may have clouds that fit the descriptor for a given subspecies (cirrus clouds will not ever fit into the opacus subspecies, as they are never dark)., Some clouds form special accessory parts that can be classified. One such example is the special “tuba” formation. This is when a cumulonimbus forms a funnel or tornado. Different cloud families are capable of different special forms., One interesting trait of clouds is that they are constantly in motion. As conditions change, cloud formations can shift from one family to another. You can observe these transformations to further classify and understand clouds.

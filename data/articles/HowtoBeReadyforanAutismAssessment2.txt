 Politely say hello, introduce yourself, and shake hands. Tell yourself that the psychologist will be your new friend for a few hours, and she will most likely be a very good listener. There is no need to worry.
 Here, it is okay to stim (rocking, flapping, etc.). Similarly, don't feel pressured to seem "autistic enough." All autistic people are different, and it's natural to have traits stereotypical of neurotypicals—gesturing, picking up on irritation, etc. Autism is a spectrum of many different traits and abilities, and your psychologist will not decide that you aren't autistic just because you used a few hand gestures.


It is okay to say "No, I've never experienced this symptom of autism" if you have not experienced a certain symptom.
 Autistic people may also have anxiety, depression, epilepsy, sensory processing disorder, anger issues, sleeping issues, and other mental or physical illnesses. Your psychologist may be able to screen you for those or refer you to someone who can.
 At public schools, higher level education, and workplaces, you may be able to receive accommodations to meet your special needs. The psychologist may be able to write a report recommending specific accommodations. Here are some examples of accommodations that autistic people tend to receive if needed:A note-taker for lectures
The ability to take tests in a separate, quiet room with or without extra time
Stim toys or an exercise ball in the classroom (Almost all workplaces encourage these)
Access to a disability center

, Give yourself time to cope and adjust. Recognize that a diagnosis does not define who you are, nor does a lack of a diagnosis deny your experiences.


Recognize that occasionally, professionals can be wrong.For example, this writer was given two different diagnoses by two different psychologists, and relied upon her own judgment and education to decide which one was right.
 Autistic or not, you are still likable and can make a contribution to the world.

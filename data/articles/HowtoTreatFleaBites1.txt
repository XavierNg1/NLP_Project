 Sometimes, flea bites itch so severely that you need to take an oral antihistamine. Your doctor or pharmacist can provide suggestions for OTC or prescription solutions. Some antihistamines that you might consider include:


Diphenhydramine. Diphenhydramine is OTC and provides quick relief for most itching, but often makes users drowsy. Look for the non-drowsy version.
Tripelennamin hydrochloride is another OTC drug, and similar to Diphenhydramine. Tripelennamin hydrochloride is taken orally.
Hydroxyzine is prescription only. If your itching becomes severe and you need relief that OTC antihistamines can't give you, ask your doctor about Hydroxyzine, which works by reducing the natural histamines in the body.
 It can damage the skin and allow infection to occur. Use an over the counter itch relief product like Calamine lotion or one containing hydrocortisone to relieve the itching instead.

 While you’ll mix the mask up in a blender, it helps to break up the bananas beforehand. Peel 3 overripe bananas, and place them in a small bowl. Use a fork to mash the fruit into a smooth, thick paste.If you have an extremely powerful blender, you can skip this step.
 After you’ve mashed the bananas, place them in the pitcher of a blender. Add 2 tablespoons (14 g) of raw honey and 1 tablespoon (14 g) coconut oil, and puree the mixture until it has a thick, creamy consistency, which should take approximately 15 to 30 seconds.If you find that your blender needs some liquid to really blend the mask, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of water.
 Once the mask is mixed, work it in in sections so you cover all of your hair. Rub it into your scalp too, and cover your head with a shower cap or plastic wrap. Let it sit on your hair for 30 minutes., When the time is up, thoroughly rinse the mask from your hair with warm water. Follow up with your usual conditioner, and brush your hair out with a detangling brush or comb before letting it air dry.

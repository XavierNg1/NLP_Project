 Setting natural curls in a bob is easiest when your hair is already wet. Plan to style your hair this way when you are fresh out of the shower or have dampened your hair.


To dampen your hair, you can put water in a spray bottle and mist your hair, or you can put your head under a faucet in a sink or bathtub.
 There are many products available on the market that are specifically designed for use on curly hair. Choose one that fits your type of hair (e.g. thick, thin, fine, damaged, et cetera).


A mousse or a gel would work best. You can also select a hairspray to finish.
 Styling your your hair upside-down will help to add volume.


You can skip this step if you feel that your hair already has enough volume naturally.
 Rub your palms together so that the product spreads over both hands.


Start with this amount for now; you can add more later if you feel that you need it.
 It often works best to focus your hands on smaller sections of hair and gently push upward, toward your scalp, gently closing your hand over the hair to scrunch it as you do so.


Make sure to apply product and scrunch all over your head. Some people forget about the bottom layer, but that can still be seen if it is left untouched. Scrunch your hair all the way to the back of your neck.
 You can apply more product to your hair, if you need to, and scrunch missed areas now that you are standing up. Use a mirror to help you spot missed sections of hair.
 Oftentimes, this is enough for naturally curly hair to set well. However, there are a couple of additional steps that you can take, if you desire.


Consider using a diffuser on your blow dryer and drying your hair with that. This both adds volume and curls your hair.
Spritz hairspray onto your hair to really secure the curls. This could results in your hair looking “crunchy” and hard instead of smooth; it is up to your preference of how you want your hair to look.

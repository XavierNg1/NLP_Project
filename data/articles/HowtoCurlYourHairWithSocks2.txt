 You should cut off about two inches of the sock.
 You might consider using two socks for a thicker ring. This will result in larger waves.
 Hair should be slightly damp. You can either shower and towel-dry hair prior to styling, or spritz your dry hair with water. Fasten with an elastic hairband.
 Place the end of the ponytail through the hole in the sock ring. Now wrap the end of your ponytail around the ring and roll down the sock until you reach your head. The bun should stay in place.
 If it is daytime, then leave the sock in place for 3-4 hours, or as long as it takes for hair to dry completely.
 Gently tousle your hair to release the waves.
 Spritz your hair with hairspray if you have naturally straight hair or if you want to achieve lasting waves throughout the day.

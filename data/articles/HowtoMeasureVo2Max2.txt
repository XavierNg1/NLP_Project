 Walk in slow circles and do light stretching for 10 minutes to warm up before starting the test. If you don’t have a heart rate monitor you can take your pulse yourself and determine the number of beats per minute by counting your heartbeat over 60 seconds.
 You can walk 1 mile on a treadmill or walk four times around a .25 mile (.40 km) athletic track. You want to make sure your walking track is mostly flat. Walk as quickly as possible without breaking into a jog. You should be breathing heavily, but able to speak 2 or 3 words in a row.On a scale of 1 to 10 the effort should feel like a 7 or 8.
 After 1 mile, turn off the stop watch and immediately check your heart rate.If you have a heart rate monitor, record the reading. Otherwise, check your heart rate using the manual method:


To determine your heart rate without a monitor, place two fingers against the artery on the side of your neck, just under your jaw. You should be able to feel your heart beat on your fingers.
Set a timer for 60 seconds and count the number of beats you feel. This is your resting heart rate in beats per minute.
Continue walking, slowly, for another 5 minutes to cool down.
 If you are male, use the number 1, if you are female, use the number 0 for the calculation.For example: A 26 year-old male who weighs 160 lbs, walks a mile in 15 minutes and has a heart rate of 120 at the end.
VO2 = 132.853 – (0.0769 x weight in lb) - (0.3877 x age) + (6.315 x gender) - (3.2649 x walk time in minutes) - (0.156 x heart rate)
VO2 = 132.853 – (0.0769 x 160) - (0.3877 x 26) + (6.315 x 1) - (3.2649 x 15) - (0.156 x 120)
VO2 = 132.853 - 12.304 – 10.08 + 6.315 – 48.97 – 18.72 = 49 mL/kg/min.

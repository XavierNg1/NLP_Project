 A pumice stone is a beauty tool that can be found in the beauty section of grocery stores and drugstores. It will likely be near the body washes and loofahs or body sponges.
 As you prepare to remove hair with the pumice stone, exfoliating your skin helps to remove the layer of dead skin cells and soften your hair, which will make it easier to remove.


Take care to do this anywhere that you want to remove hair with the pumice stone.
 Rather than starting anywhere on your body, start with the pumice stone at the hairline in the area from which you want to remove hair.
 Continue rubbing with gentle pressure until the hair is removed from that area. Then, move onto the next area and repeat.


Continue this process until you have reached every section of the body part on which you are working.
 This will help to remove both loose hair and dead skin cells removed by the pumice stone.
 Natural moisturizers, such as jojoba or coconut oil, can be used. They will moisturize the skin and help to reduce irritation from the pumice stone.
 Use soapy water and a nail brush to clean the pumice stone of hair and dead skin cells after use. This will keep it working efficiently., This method only removes hair for a couple of days, much like shaving. You can repeat it in a couple of days to maintain smooth, hairless skin.

 When the oil is fresh on your ball, it'll be easiest to wipe away. Wipe your ball after every game to maintain its condition. Keep a ball towel with your bowling gear for this purpose, and change it out after every time you play so oil doesn't build up on the cloth and transfer again to the ball.


Your ball towel, ideally, should be a lint free, microfiber cloth. Microfiber cloths will protect the finish of your ball, and lint free cloth will keep threads and pieces of cloth from rubbing onto your ball and influencing your game.
For the best results and the most consistent throws, towel off your ball after every shot. During prolonged play, you may want to swap in a clean towel at about the halfway point in your play.;
, This heat opens the pores on your ball, allowing you to clean the ball better.A little bit of alcohol goes a long way, so use it sparingly to wet your rag, then wipe down the entire surface of your ball.


After you have wiped down your ball with your alcohol dampened cloth, take a dry part of your towel or a fresh towel and wipe free any remaining moisture on its surface., The longer the oil sits on the surface of your ball, the more a chance it has to sink in and become harder to remove. This means that by cleaning your ball every time you bowl, your ball will stay cleaner for longer.This can save you a considerable amount in professional cleaning and help you bowl more consistently.

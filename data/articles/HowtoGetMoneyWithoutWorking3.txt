 If you already have a job, but you need some extra cash before your next payday, you may benefit from a payday loan. These are short-term loans that are offered for relatively small sums of money, either online or at brick and mortar locations.Be cautious with these kinds of loans, as they carry extremely high interest rates. They are best used for absolute emergencies only.
 Many credit card companies will send you checks in the mail that you can write for cash or give you the option of withdrawing money from an ATM using your credit card. Like payday loans, cash advances typically come with high interest rates, which makes them a costly option.Be sure to read the fine print carefully so that you understand exactly how much this kind of lending will cost you.
 Banks and credit unions offer a wide variety of loan products. Some loans, like home equity loans, require you to offer your personal assets as collateral if you are not able to repay the loan. If you do not have a home or other assets, you may still be able to qualify for a personal loan, depending on your financial circumstances.Be sure to compare rates terms at multiple institutions before you commit to a loan. Credit unions often offer lower interest rates than banks.
 Borrowing money from people you care about can be complicated because your relationship may be at risk if you can't pay the money back. If you choose to borrow from friends or family, be sure to be honest with them about how long it will take you to pay them back.

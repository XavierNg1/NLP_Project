 This lightening formula calls for chamomile tea, lemon juice, cinnamon, honey and olive oil. Additionally, you’ll need a clean spray bottle that will hold 1.5 cups (12 fluid ounces) of the lightening spray.The exact measurements are:


1 chamomile tea bag;
1/2 cup lemon juice (freshly squeezed);
1 teaspoon cinnamon;
1 teaspoon honey;
1 teaspoon olive oil.
 Place the tea bag in a mug and pour the boiling water over it (just as you would if you were making yourself a cup of tea). Allow the tea bag to steep until the water has cooled to room temperature, which will take about 30 minutes.Remove the bag from the water and dispose of it once you’ve finished steeping.
 The tea liquid should fill your 12 ounce spray bottle about halfway up. Then measure out ½ cup lemon juice, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon olive oil and add those to the spray bottle.


1 teaspoon of coconut oil can be substituted for the olive oil, if you prefer.Add ½ teaspoon of sea salt to the mixture to achieve textured, beachy waves.
If you heat up the honey for a few seconds in the microwave, it will be thinner and easier to work with.
 Once all of the ingredients are in the bottle, attach the nozzle to the spray bottle to close it up. Shake the bottle well to combine the ingredients. Be sure to put the nozzle on tightly to avoid any messes.
 After spraying the formula on your hair, run a fine-toothed comb through it to make sure the lightening spray is evenly distributed.


To achieve an ombre look, spray the mixture on the ends of your hair only. For a more dramatic ombre look, spray it on the bottom half of your hair., The spray will keep for 3-4 days as long as you keep it cold. You can use this mixture on your hair whenever you plan to be outside in the sun during those 3-4 days.

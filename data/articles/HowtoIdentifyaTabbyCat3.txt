 Unlike other tabbies, ticked tabby cats do not typically have body stripes. Instead, each individual hair on a ticked tabby has stripes or bands of color variation. This is the tell-tale sign of a ticked tabby., Though ticked tabbies may not look like a typical tabby cat, they still exhibit the same distinct facial patterns. Look for the "M" on the forehead and light pencil marks on either side of the face., Not all ticked tabbies have translucent coats, but some, like those in the Abyssinian breed, do have semi-translucent hair.

 You want just enough to cover your material, while still maintaining a 1:2 ratio of vinegar to milk. The smaller the stain, the less liquid you'll need.
 Leave it in the kitchen, go watch some TV, and go to bed. Revisit it in the morning to give it adequate time for miracle-working. Keep it at room temperature and only cover it if you're concerned about a smell; it'll work either way.
 Squeeze it out to avoid any mess. Hang the fabric dry and wash as normal. If you see a light silhouette of the stain, don't worry; it'll come out after a washing.

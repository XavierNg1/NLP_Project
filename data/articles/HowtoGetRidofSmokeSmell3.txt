 One of the most important things you can do is simply to let your car air out. Roll all of your windows down and let them remain open for a few hours to a couple of days.


If possible, leave the car doors wide open instead of simply the windows. This maximizes the amount of airflow going through the car.
Consider running battery-powered fans in the car to push the air out faster. If possible, choose a windy day to air the car out, as well.
Do not turn the car on and run the fan as it sits in one spot, especially if the car is in an enclosed space like a garage. Doing so can cause deadly carbon monoxide to build up.
 Use a vehicle upholstery cleaner on the the seats and floors. Scrub the interior of the car from top to bottom.


Floor mats may need to be removed and washed separately. If you find it difficult to remove the odor from the mats, replace them.



Follow the label instructions carefully when applying the product.
Let the car air out for a few days after using a product like this since a chemical smell will likely remain immediately after use.
Use a vacuum cleaner to remove any residue left behind by the product.
 While these remedies usually mask the odor instead of removing it, many people do stand by them.


Place a bowl of vinegar, container of fresh coffee grounds, or open bag of charcoal in the car overnight or for a few days.
Sprinkling baking soda over all the surfaces of the car interior and let sit overnight. Vacuum the excess in the morning.

 Playing with your dog will often involve activities like chasing or wrestling as they are built to withstand more physical activity than other dogs. Pay attention to your dog’s body language and notice when they are no longer interested in playing or are getting frustrated.Spend fifteen minutes playing with your dog when you get home from work.
 Taking a behavioral training class with your Pitbull is another way to create a firm bond with your dog and learn a new skill or behavior. Teaching and learning from your Pitbull will help establish a bond that only the two of you will have!


Taking a behavioral class is also a great way to access resources and utilities you might not otherwise have, like agility and obstacle courses.
 Although it is important to establish routines and good behaviors, it is equally important to enjoy your dog as well. Going for short outings or trips, buying a new toy, or giving your dog treats are all great ways to spend time and show appreciation.


Instead of your daily exercise routine, take your Pitbull on a hike.
Show affection for your dog by petting, rubbing, and stroking them.
 Pitbulls can often have complex histories due to their frequent breeding and associations with fighting and aggression. Although researching your dog’s history and past behaviors is useful to everyday routines, taking the time to understand your Pitbull’s current behaviors, ailments, or moods will help you strengthen your bond and prepare you both for a mutually beneficial relationship.


If your Pitbull is a rescue and has had a history of fighting, consult your local shelter or vet for advice on how to treat severe aggression or mistreatment issues.
Rescued Pitbull’s can often come with past injuries of which they can be protective. Consult your vet to find out where your dog might be sensitive.

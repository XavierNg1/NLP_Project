 Shrubs should be kept well watered until they are established, which usually happens after a few months. The commonest reason for new plants to fail is lack of water.


Beware hot summer weather but remember wind is also very drying even in cool temperatures.
 Because shrubs last for many years, these plants tend to establish enough root structure that they require less watering than plants such as annual bedding flowers. Most shrubs will only need watering in the driest periods after they become established.
 It’s good practice to ‘top up’ the mulch every year as this helps preserve soil moisture, reducing the amount the plant will need watering. To replace mulch:


Remove any residual mulch from the previous year.
Remove any weeds and then apply a fresh layer of mulching material.

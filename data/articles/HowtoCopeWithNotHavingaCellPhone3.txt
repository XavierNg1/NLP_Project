 Find some hobbies that occupy your mind and that you find fun. Reading, drawing, writing, listening to music, cooking, or watching movies. Activities that require you to think or use your hands are best. Your mind will be occupied, and you will not miss having a phone.


You may join an after school club or some sort of extracurricular activity that you find fun. This is a great way to socialize with other people who have your same interests.
 Volunteering is a good way to show your parents that you are responsible and reliable. This is also an opportunity to give back to your community and help other people. Try to find volunteer opportunities that match with your interests.For example, if you enjoy reading, you may volunteer at a local library. If you were interested in health care, you could volunteer at a local hospital or nursing home.
 Cell phones often get in the way of making connections with other people. You can be so wrapped up in your phone that you spend less time developing relationships with the important people in your life. Instead of worrying about getting a phone, spend time with your family and friends.


When you are spending time with people, tell them that it is a no phone zone. This will keep everybody engaged, and you will not feel left out because you are the only one without a phone.
 Get outside and explore nature. You will have a more positive attitude and feel less stressed. Go for a walk, a hike, or exercise outside. Sit at the park and read or hang out with a friend. Take the time to really absorb the sights and sounds of nature while you are out there.

 When thinking about why a bank should give you money when they are the ones keeping track of your money for you, it is important to remember that you are giving the bank a loan. When you deposit money into the bank the bank is then using your money for its own purposes. Thus, they pay interest to you as a way of thanking you for the loan.Usually, the bank uses your money to make loans to other bank customers. The bank makes money on this by charging higher interest fees on the loans than what they are paying you in interest., Not all accounts will offer compound interest specifically. Compound interest is a great thing because not only does it pay interest on what you put in the account (this is called the principal), it also pays interest on the interest it paid you last time.This makes your money grow faster than if they just paid you interest on the amount you put in the bank and left the extra interest money out of the equation.
 In the society we live in, it’s important for children to learn why it’s important to save money, and how they can do it most effectively. If you give your children an allowance, teaching them to save part of that allowance rather than running to the store to blow it all at once can create good spending habits that will follow them throughout their life.When teaching children about compound interest, make sure that you begin the discussion by talking about what interest is in the first place.
For example, you can say something like, “When you have a bank account, they do their best to keep your money safe. At the same time, though, they take your money and lend it to other people who need it. As a way of saying thank you, banks usually pay you a little bit of money. This is usually a percentage, say 5%. They pay you 5% of whatever you’ve got in your account. So if you have $500 dollars, they pay you an extra $25 just because they appreciate you keeping your money with them.”

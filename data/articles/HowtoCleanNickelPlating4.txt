 Ammonia, like vinegar, is effective on stains. Pour a small amount of pure household ammonia into a bowl. Drip a scouring pad or rag into it.
 Apply your pad or rag gently to the object. Scrub with increasing intensity on the deep stains. This is best done on pure nickel to minimize the abrasion from the pad and cleaner., For a more intense cleaning solution, combine one part ammonia to three parts water. Never submerge the nickel plating in straight ammonia; after 30 minutes it will cause the plating to chip and flake., Place your object in the container. You can also pour the solution over the object. Let it sit in the ammonia mixture for up to 30 minutes.
 Use warm, running water to wash away the ammonia. Another option is to use clean, soft rag dipped in warm water. Run the water or rag over your plated item, making sure all the ammonia is removed.

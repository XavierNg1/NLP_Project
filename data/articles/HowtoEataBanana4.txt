 Set the bananas slices aside, but have them ready for frying.
 Stir them with a spatula as they melt so that they get mixed together. Once the butter is melted and bubbling, you are ready for the next step.
 As the bananas cook, they will start to caramelize and turn a golden brown color. If they start to burn too fast, however, turn the heat down.
 They are ready when both sides are a golden brown color. Be sure to have a plate ready for serving.
 You can serve them on their own, or with other foods, such as: French toast, ice cream, pancakes, or yogurt.

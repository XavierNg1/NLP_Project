 To brown food in a microwave without a dedicated browning dish, you must first cook the food through all the way. Browning in a microwave is completed after cooking, rather than during cooking.

Because microwaves cook from the inside out using superheated molecules, browning raw or uncooked food is not possible.
 If your microwave is equipped with a grill rack, use this to place your food on. If not, simply place your food facedown in a microwave-safe dish.

A grill is ideal, as it provides beautiful sear marks for your food, and allows air to circulate more freely than a dish, resulting in a more even cooking experience.
 Use your microwave’s grill, because the grill setting also concentrates heat on the metal portion of the grill and can create a browning effect. If your microwave does not have a “grill” feature, you can place a small amount of foil into the bottom of a glass or ceramic cooking dish to simulate a grill., Finish by placing your microwave on its highest setting and cooking as usual. While it will not brown as thoroughly as an oven, enlisting the help of small amounts of metal will concentrate heat on the outside of your food.

Cook according to the recipe. If you desire a crisper, browner texture, you can cook on high in the microwave, then finish by pan-searing or broiling your food in a standard oven.

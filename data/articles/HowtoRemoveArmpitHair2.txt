 Depilatory cream comes in various strengths. Some is meant for sensitive spots like the face and armpits, while other formulas are designed to take off thick leg hair. Start with the cream for sensitive areas; if it doesn't work well, you can always try the extra-strength stuff later.


Using cream that's too strong for your skin can leave you with a rash.
When in doubt, pick one that's meant for the face.
 Rinse away deodorant and sweat so you're applying the cream to freshly washed skin. Pat your armpits dry with a towel.
 Make sure the skin is pulled taut. Get into a comfortable position you can hold for a few minutes, since you'll need to hold your arm upright the whole time you're using the cream.
 Try not to apply it to the bare skin surrounding your hair. Use only as much as needed to cover the hair.
 Keep your arm raised and let the cream go to work. Most creams recommend waiting three to ten minutes to let the chemicals dissolve the hair. Do not leave the cream on your skin longer than the recommended amount of time.


If this is the first time you've used depilatory cream, rinse it off after one minute to make sure it isn't causing an allergic reaction; look for redness, itching and bumps. Reapply if your skin seems to be fine.
The cream may sting a little, but it shouldn't burn or be painful. If you feel pain, wash it off.
 Follow the same process, applying the cream over your hair and allowing it to work for the recommended amount of time. Rinse when you're finished.
 This gives your skin time to heal after the treatment and reduces the chance that the deodorant will irritate your armpits.

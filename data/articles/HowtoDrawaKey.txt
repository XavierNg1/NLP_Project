 This will serve as the head of the key. It should be vaguely bean-like in shape, and sloping in whatever direction you'd like your key to extend.;
, Your picture should look like a hammer at this point, but with a rounder head.Â 

, It can be almost perfectly square-shaped, as shown in the example, or you can make it longer/narrower; the shape of your key is up to you.
 (For this tutorial, a basic look is used, just a few sections of the rectangle cut out to make the key look real.) Once you've done that, add an oval within the head of the key and two small, thin ovals on along the length of the key

, Erase the sketch lines. Add any extra details you like, such as more designs on the skinny part of the key or a different shape to the end.
 Use grey/yellow (like in the example) or bronze/silver/gold for an eye-catching look.

 As you land, keep your legs bent so that they’ll bend at a 90-degree angle when you hit the ground., Be sure to land on the balls of your feet, so that you can easily roll forward.Keep sinking deeper into your land until you’re crouched, with your legs tucked up into your chest.
 Now that you’re close to the ground, put your hands out in front of you. This will pull your shoulders in, preparing your body for the roll., With your feet still tucked up behind you, push off the ground with your toes. Spring up and forward, onto your hands in front of you. This will propel you into your parkour roll.
 Once you learn this move, you’re well on your way to more complex parkour sequences.

 The extremely simple way is to find a frozen river or patch of water, place a block on top of the ice (PC: press the number corresponding to your item in your hotbar, or use the mouse scroll button to select the item, then right-clicking on the area; Xbox: select items by pressing the Right and Left Bumper buttons, and place it by pressing the left trigger button), and then place a torch in the middle of it. This method is the simplest, and relies on the Torch’s ability to melt the water to provide a steady source of water. You can also place a torch on the shore and harvest the Ice forming at the fringes of the resulting path of water.


This is a little ineffective compared to the next two methods since you run the risk of running out of water, or creating an un harvestable flowing patch of water if you’re not too careful.
 This method is a bit more streamlined, but takes an area of at least 5x5 blocks. First, dig a square of land about 3x3 blocks big and 2 blocks deep. Fill the bottom of the hole with water until the whole pool is still. You can gather water with your bucket; just go up to some water with your bucket equipped, and select the water. The easiest and least time- and resource-consuming way of filling up your pool is by selecting your filled bucket again to place the water on the four corners of the pool. You can also craft multiple buckets and then fill them with water to minimize the effort of gathering water, but only if you have enough resources to do so.


Slowly place some blocks in an alternating pattern around the top of the pool, which would cover strategic parts of the pool to keep it from freezing entirely. It should look a bit like this:
b = base block (dirt, cobblestone, sandstone, etc.
w = water
X = blank space
Pool:
b b b b b
b w w w b
b w w w b
b w w w b
b b b b b
Cover Layer:
b b b b b
b b X b X
b X X X X
b b X X X
This method is more efficient since it covers certain areas, so that when the ice is harvested, the water flows back in without danger of running out, making the ice an infinitely renewable resource.
 The last method is yet another variation of this simple system, but streamlines the process even further and removes the possibility of errant flow patterns due to its design. Basically, you create a trench about 3 blocks wide and however long you want. Then fill in the trench with water.


One way you can do this quickly is to place water at the corners of your pool then every two or three blocks along the trench, you place your water at the middle until you reach the end. At 2 blocks above your trench, create a capital I shape like so:
Pool
b b b b b
b w w w b
b w w w b
b w w w b
b w w w b
b w w w b
b w w w b
b w w w b
d d d d d
Cover Layer (must be two blocks above bottom of pool)
X X X X X
X b b b X
X X b X X
X X b X X
X X b X X
X X b X X
X X b X X
X b b b X
X X X X X
This streamlines the process considerably without using redstone, but also ensures the production is faster and more efficient than the first two methods.

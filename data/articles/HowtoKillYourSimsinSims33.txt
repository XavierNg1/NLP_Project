 Open the cheat console with Control + ⇧ Shift + C. Type in testingcheatsenabled true to enable the options below.


Careful! These cheats can cause broken save files and crashes, especially if you use them on NPCs. Disable them as soon as you're done with testingcheatsenabled false.
 Hold down ⇧ Shift and click the Sim. Select "Trigger Age Transition" to advance to the next age category. Repeat until the Sim is an elder, then trigger it one more time to make them die of old age.
 With these cheats enabled, moodlet bars can be altered by clicking and dragging. Drag the hunger bar until the Sim starves.
 This will skip all the in-game deaths and just remove the Sim, which can be handy if the Sim is permanently stuck in a bug. Shift-click the Sim and select "Delete."


This is especially likely to damage your save file if you try it on an NPC.

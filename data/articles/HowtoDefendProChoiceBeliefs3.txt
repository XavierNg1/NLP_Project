 Global studies suggest that abortion rates are not really affected by whether abortion is legal.Thus, banning abortion would not reduce abortions, but force people to use underground methods, which can be much more risky.


Free contraception and comprehensive sex education can lower abortion rates.One estimate suggested that free contraception could cut the abortion rate by as much as 75%.If they really are concerned about life, instead of being anti-sex, then they should be campaigning for these things.
 For example, the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act significantly reduced abortion-related deaths. When abortion is legal, it becomes safer, saving lives of people who seek it.If anyone believes that abortion seekers deserve to die, point out that it isn't very pro-life to want pregnant person and fetus dead.
 The procedure used in performing abortions is identical to the procedure used to investigate bad pap smears. This is how abortions were covered up in the past.
 They were about safety and the right to privacy.

 If cats are hunting in your yard, they may be finding easy prey.


If you don’t want to remove the bird feeders, make sure they are free hanging, in locations where the cat can’t climb or jump to attack birds.
 If your children have a sandbox for play, make sure it is only open during active playtime. If it cannot be closed or covered, consider removing the sandbox.


Cats are attracted to sand as a litter material. Allowing children to play in places that have cat feces can expose them to zoonotic diseases.
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) suggests distracting cats from your yard by placing a small sandbox nearby. Although you will be creating a litter box that you have to change frequently, it will be a more attractive place for cats than your gardens.
 If you feed your cat outdoors, it is only a matter of time before other cats will use your house as a food sources.
 Male cats that are not neutered can find the scent and discover your yard.

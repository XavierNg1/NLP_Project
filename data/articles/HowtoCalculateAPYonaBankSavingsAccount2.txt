 Another way to calculate the APY is to work backward from your actual savings, to determine the rate that you earned. To perform this calculation, you need the following information:Interest. This is the amount of interest that you earned over a specified period of time. You will need good bank records or a periodic bank report to get this number.

Principal. This is the amount of money that you held in your account to earn the interest. If the amount of principal changes over time, you will need to perform separate calculations for each time period that the principal is constant, and add them together.

Days. This is the number of days that the Principal remained in the account when the interest accrued.
 When you know the amount of money in your account and the amount of interest that you earned, you can calculate the APY with the following formula:APY=100{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=100}


I{\displaystyle I} is the interest earned


P{\displaystyle P} is the amount of principal


d{\displaystyle d} is the number of days




, Suppose you learn that you earned $60 interest on a savings account that started with $5,000, over half a year (182.5 days). Use this information to calculate the APY that you received:APY=100{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=100}


APY=100{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=100}


APY=100{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=100}


APY=100{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=100}


APY=100{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=100}


APY=2.4144%{\displaystyle {\text{APY}}=2.4144\%}

The final step of the calculation, multiplying by 100, is just to transform the decimal figure into a percentage.

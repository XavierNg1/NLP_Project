 Find out how many gallons of fuel your vehicle's fuel tank holds. For each 1 gallon (4 L) of fuel, you will need to add 1 oz (30 ml) of Seafoam.Adding Seafoam directly to the fuel tank will provide a variety of benefits. It can clean deposits left behind in the fuel injectors, thereby making your vehicle run more smoothly. It can also control moisture buildup in the fuel, stabilize the fuel, and lubricate the upper cylinders.
 Go to the gas station and fill the vehicle's gas tank with octane gasoline.


When filling the tank, make sure that you leave enough room in the tank to add the calculated amount of Seafoam afterward.
While Seafoam can technically be used with any octane gas, it is recommended that you use it with 91 octane or higher. Fuel with a higher octane number requires a greater amount of heat and compression to ignite, leading to improved performance. The Seafoam can provide a greater benefit to the vehicle under these conditions, as well.
 Place a long-neck funnel in the fuel tank and pour your calculated amount of Seafoam directly into the fuel tank.Pour the product slowly to avoid spills.
Using a funnel will also help prevent spills. Due to the design of the bottle and the position of the fuel tank opening, it is nearly impossible to pour Seafoam directly from the bottle and into the fuel tank without the use of a funnel.
 Put the fuel tank cap back on and drive your car at a steady pace for at least five to ten minutes.


As you drive, the Seafoam should mix into the gasoline, improving the quality of the gasoline and cleaning the fuel injectors at the same time.
Try to run this tank of gasoline until the vehicle is nearly empty to maximize the effectiveness of the Seafoam.
After completing this step, the process is complete.

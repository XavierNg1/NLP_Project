Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB): This is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into a suspicious breast growth and fluid is withdrawn into a syringe. A local anesthetic and/or a calming medication may be used for this type of biopsy. The patient is usually in the sitting position.
Core needle biopsy (CNB): This procedure uses a wide-diameter needle to withdraw samples of tissue up to .5 inches (1.27 cm) long.
Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy: A small incision is made in the breast, and the physician uses a special instrument and imaging system to remove samples of the suspect area in the breast.
Excision (surgical) biopsy: The doctor makes a larger incision than that used in the vacuum-assisted breast biopsy to remove a whole lump or a portion of a large lump. General anesthesia may be used, and the incision will need to be closed with sutures or medical staples.

 Use a dry wad of paper towel or cheesecloth to blot the leather or suede with gentle tapping motions. This works especially well with fresh stains, but may not be effective with older, dried stains.Never use water on leather or suede.
 Fill a large bowl halfway full with lukewarm water, then add a squirt of mild liquid soap to the water. Swish the water around by shaking the bowl or by swirling your hand around in the water to create suds., Use your hands to scoop up the suds and bubbles you created, then add the suds to a clean sponge. Sponge the suds onto the stain and pat the stain gently., After you pat in the suds into the stain, use a dry paper towel or cloth to wipe the suds away from the fabric. You should see that the soap suds have worked to partially or completely remove the stain., If the stain is still visible in the leather or suede, sprinkle on enough cornmeal to lightly cover the stain. Let the cornmeal sit for about half an hour.Cornmeal works by lifting and absorbing the stain.
 After you have let the cornmeal sit for around half an hour, use a dry, stiff-bristled brush to delicately brush the cornmeal off of the leather or suede. If you see that some of the stain is still there, add on more cornmeal. Keep repeating until all the stain has been absorbed and removed.

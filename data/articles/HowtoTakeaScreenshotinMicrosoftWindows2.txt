 The One Window screenshot function will take a picture of the "active" window on your screen. This means that it should be in front of all your other windows.
 An image of the window will be copied to the clipboard. The dimensions of the image will be determined by the size of the window when the screenshot is captured.You will not receive any confirmation that the screenshot has been taken.
 Once you’ve made the screenshot, you will need to paste it to a program in order to see it. The most common way to paste it is into a Paint file. This will allow you to save it as an image file that can be transferred to others.


Open Paint from the Accessories section in your Start menu. In Windows 8, type “paint” while on the Start screen and select it from the search results. With a new blank canvas open, press Ctrl+V to paste the image onto the canvas. You can also open the Edit menu and select Paste, or right-click on the canvas and select Paste.
Click File, then Save to set the name and file type of the image. The most common file types are JPG and PNG. The recommended format for screenshots is PNG, due to the high quality and small file size.
You can also paste the screenshot into other programs, such as Word or into the body of an email. Simply open the program that you want to paste the image into and press Ctrl+V.

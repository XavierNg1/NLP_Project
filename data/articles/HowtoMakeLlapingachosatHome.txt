 The water can then be drained from the pan to allow the potatoes to dry for several minutes. After they have dried sufficiently, they should be mashed. This is the time to add any salt that is desired. After mashing, the potatoes will need to be divided into sections of about a third of a cup, and formed into balls. Allow them to chill for a half an hour.;
, While waiting for the potatoes to set up, the sauce can be made. The milk should be cooked on a low simmer, along with the sliced onions. After ten minutes have passed, pull the onions out and throw them away. The peanut butter should then be blended into the milk, with the desired amount of salt. Once the sauce reaches a boil, the heat can be turned to low to allow the sauce to become thicker. This should take about five or six minutes.
 When the potatoes have cooled sufficiently, pull them out and add about a tablespoon and a half of the cheese and scallions to each ball. Put the oil in a pan and put the stove on a moderate level of heat. Once the balls have been made into patties, place them within the pan of oil two at a time and allow them to cook until they are brown.
 To ensure that they are hot when served, it is often a good idea to place the finished patties into the oven to keep them warm while others are browning.

 Meltdowns can be frightening, but remember that your sibling is simply trying to find balance. The best you can do for them at these times is talk to them gently and be respectful, and engage them in a calming routine that your family can practice for just these situations.For instance, if you ask "Do you want a hug?" and your sibling says no, don't hug them. Your sibling still loves you and needs you, but might not be able to handle human touch at the moment. It's not personal.
Don't hold on to your anger. It is natural to get angry at times with your sibling. Everyone in the history of siblings has done it. The key is to remember that you love them.
 Pay attention to what has led up to the meltdown, so you can help your sibling in the future. Autistic people meltdown when they feel overwhelmed, so chances are good that the signs for the meltdown were noticeable before it happened—you just have to recognize those signs., Your sibling isn't a toddler having a tantrum—they are just someone struggling with communicating in the ways you are familiar with. At times they may say inappropriate or tactless things, and their stimming may seem strange to you. Remember that they almost always mean well, and try not to take odd actions personally.

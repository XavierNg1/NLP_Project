 Mice are attracted to the forgotten corners of basements, closets, and storage rooms. Remove the following types of clutter to make your home less inviting to mice looking for a place to build a nest:


Boxes of old cookware. Plates, glasses, pots and pans you've been meaning to sell at the next yard sale might be attracting mice to your basement or storage room.
Piles of clothing. You might notice little bite marks in your clothes if you leave them on the floor for too long. Clothing stored in bags is also susceptible to being used as a mouse nest. Store clothes you don't wear often in a wooden chest or plastic bins to keep mice out.
Piles of magazines, newspapers, or other papers. These provide materials for mice to make into nests.
Cardboard boxes. Mice can chew right through boxes, so don't store them on the floor.
Cans, bottles or other old food storage containers. Mice may be attracted to the smell of the food residue.
Old furniture. Now might be the time to get rid of that old loveseat gathering dust in the basement. Anything made of cloth, especially if it isn't often used, could make a cozy home for a mouse.
 Old spills, crumbs, and every day dirt and debris can attract mice. Make your home less enticing to mice by disinfecting your floors and running a vacuum over the carpet a few times a week.


Pay attention to the corners of rooms where balls of dust and hair collect. Mice use these materials to make nests.
Don't forget the garage. Make sure the floor of your garage is swept clean of dirt, sand, gravel and other materials that may have accumulated.

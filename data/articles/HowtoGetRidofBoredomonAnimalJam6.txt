 So you think your den is cool as is gets? It may be. But this isn't the point of this method. We are talking about making hospitals, gyms, advice centers, shops, whatever you want!


The advice center is ideal if you like helping people. It can also be a happiness center. You could design it as an enchanted hollow den, fill the first floor with plushies, have a desk and chair on the second floor, with pillows, laptop and candle, and on the third floor, have a fire put, diner booths, sofas and couches, student chairs, a tablet and so forth. But use your own imagination to create what works best for you.
 Oh look, they made an adventure themed den, maybe you could make one too, in your style! Or, if it's Christmas, make a Christmas den. When the FIFA World cup is on, make a soccer field den or a gym den. If anything inspires you, use it.

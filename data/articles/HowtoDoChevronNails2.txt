 Remove each piece of tape from the edge of the table and apply it across the width of each of your nails. Press the tape onto your nails and into the edge of your nails near your cuticle so that you can make the chevron design go all the way across your nails.
 Use a second color of nail polish to paint over your entire nail and the tape. Make sure that the second coat is thick enough to completely cover the first color. Do not allow the second coat to dry before you remove the tape.
 Pull the tape strips off from your nails. Begin by pulling at the edges of the tape and continue to pull until you have removed the tape strip .









Make sure that you pull off the tape while your nails are still wet. You may want to only do one fingernail at a time to make sure the polish doesn’t dry.

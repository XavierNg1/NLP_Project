 Smartphones are electrical devices, and as such they produce a magnetic field. There have been applications developed that allow you to use the phone’s own magnetic field to detect metal objects. Go to your respective app store (this differs from platform to platform) and download metal detector app.One example of a metal detector app is the app “Metal Detector.”

, Once the app has downloaded, open it. Follow any setup instructions within the app so that it works optimally. When the app is loaded and ready, start passing your phone over different metal objects., The metal detector apps work by measuring changes in the magnetic field of your phone. As you pass over metal, it interacts with this field and the app detects that interaction. These interactions show as fluctuations in the magnetic field as you move from object to object.For example, as you pass over a metal object, the magnitude of the field may increase dramatically. This indicates that you have found something metal.

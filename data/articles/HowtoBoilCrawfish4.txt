 Crawfish boils can get messy, so for easy cleanup it's best to use plenty of newspaper. Line picnic tables and other outdoor tables, and set out plenty of napkins and paper towels. You might want to set out bowls for the crawfish shells and legs.
 At traditional boils, the vegetables are dumped directly onto the table, and the crawfish are added to the top. If you'd prefer not to do it this way, have guests line up at the pot with paper plates and scoop the vegetables directly from the pot to the plates.
 Butter, salt, and additional Cajun seasoning are all great condiments for a crawfish boil.

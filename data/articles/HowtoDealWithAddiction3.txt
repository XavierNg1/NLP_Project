 Throw all your cigarettes...or beer, or whatever away. Yes, wasting money, but then there's no way you could be cheating. Just throw it away. Don't buy more. Resist completely. Don't look back. Have someone else do it if you have to.
 Join a club. Go to school. Get a job. Do something! Anything to take your mind off of it, and eventually you'll forget about it altogether.
 Don't let them catch you sneaking a smoke or a Twitter update every now and then. Set yourself a punishment for when you do. Don't make a goal- you know what your goal is- to defeat your addiction. The question is, can you do it?

, It may be hard, even painful at times, but keep reminding yourself why you're doing this. You can get through!

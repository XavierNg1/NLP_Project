, Soak the Mimosa pudica seeds in a container of warm tap water for 24 to 48 hours before you plant your seeds. This will help them to sprout faster.
 Plant the seeds one-eighth inch deep in a flower pot or cup of soil.


Use a good potting mix with added perlite to allow good drainage and air circulation between the roots.
Cover the flower pot or cup with clear plastic wrap and wait for the plants to sprout. This should take about a week.
 Remove the clear wrap or greenhouse cover and place the young Mimosa pudica in a warm and mostly sunny location once they have popped above the soil.

 Have at least five feathers and up to around 20, depending on how many you can get.;
, Try to place them so that they're not overlapping too much but provide lots of area where the cat can paw at them when the stick is held up. When you're happy with the arrangement, duct tape the quill end to the stick.
 Hold the stick at the non-feather end, stand or sit near your cat and wave the toy in the cat's face. Once your cat shows interest, it should try to catch the feathers and play with them.


You may need to restick in feathers if the cat pulls any of them out.

 Examine the boot and determine where the widest part of the shaft lies. More often than not, the widest part will be at the opening of the boot, but this is not always the case.


Note that boot shaft circumference is sometimes referred to as “circumference” or “calf circumference.”

, Place the end of a tape measure at a point along the widest part of the shaft. Wrap the rest of the tape measure around the shaft until it meets the starting end. Read the tape measure at the point of intersection to determine the shaft circumference.


Make sure that the tape measure is parallel to the ground the entire way around the shaft of the boot. If the tape measure is not even or straight, the measurement can get significantly thrown off.
As with shaft height, shaft circumference is often measured in inches when discussing boot sizes in the United States.

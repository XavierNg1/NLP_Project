 These days, authorities use speed and red-light cameras in many cities and on highways. GPS alerts you to the locations of these cameras. Spend the extra money if you frequently drive in a community with these cameras installed., With traditional models, radar alerts continue to sound until you're out of range of a radar gun. Many models have a mute switch that you have to activate manually. Auto-mute lowers the volume and then shuts it off automatically. Choose this option if radar alerts distract you or if you don't feel comfortable muting the alert while driving., Expensive newer radar detector models allow you to download an app to your smartphone. Enter enforcement regions into the app as you encounter them. Other drivers will do the same to alert you. This allows you to give your detector a break, especially if you're driving in a state that bans radar detectors., Most detectors come with a one-year warranty. In many cases, this is enough. Go for an extended warranty if you live in a high-crime area or a region prone to frequent natural disasters. This is also a good idea if you're accident-prone.

 Though sugar and food coloring is easiest, you may find that you get brighter, more vibrant colors with sand and gel color. Play sand (darker sand is better for darker colors) is available at home improvement stores or pet stores for just a few dollars. Apart from those two things, you’ll also need:


Bowls of hot water
Glass containers or vases
Flowers (optional)

, Each color will need its own bowl of hot water. Not boiling, but hot – microwave it for about a minute and it should be enough. You’ll need about 1-3 spoonfuls of gel color for each bowl (depending on how vibrant you want it).If gel coloring isn’t accessible, you can use powdered tempera paint. Liquid tempera paint works, too, you just have to remove the water and work very, very slowly when you add it to the sand., You’ll likely want 1 part water to 3 parts sand. Any more and the sand may not absorb the liquid.


Stir until the color is fully and evenly immersed throughout the sand – you may find that using a whisk is best. It should be clumpy and not too liquid-y.
 This can be done one of two ways:


Drain out the excess liquid. Then spread it on a baking sheet to dry overnight.
Alternatively, pop it into the oven at 200 degrees C (350 F) on a baking sheet for 10-15 minutes or until dry.
 With dry sand, you’re ready to go. Get out a glass bottle or vase and arrange your colored sand into accessible bowls. Here’s a few tips:


Use a piece of paper or straw to act as a funnel. This will keep where you sand goes precise and even. Make layers, tilting the vase as necessary to create interesting designs.
Use the handle of a spoon, paintbrush or other small, thin device to move sand that doesn’t land where you want it.
If you’d like, put a small vase inside a larger vase. Then put the sand around it, and flowers inside the smaller vase. This gives the illusion the flowers lodged in the sand when they’re really in a vase full of water.

 You'll want to ensure that you are establishing an environment that is ideal for your toddler to feel comfortable and happy. Even if you have set up a playdate and the other child is friendly, don’t force your child to play. You can try to encourage them by playing with them or addressing any of their immediate concerns like having to go potty, but don’t make them play if they are not in the mood., Though your toddler may be very social, remember that a lot of children have difficulty sharing. If possible, put out two of each toy so that each child can have the same item to play with. This can cut down on a lot of potential arguments or tantrums.You can also provide large toys. Your toddler will be able to share this toy with another toddler. This might be a set of building blocks or a swing set in your backyard.
Consider mixing the toys altogether. Allow your children to freely play without much structure.
Avoid introducing your child’s favorite toy to the mix unless they are typically a good sharer.
 Group activities will give your child a chance to interact with other children. You can also help your toddler make friends by providing activities during their playdates. Perhaps you'll want to set up a mini soccer arena for them in your house or backyard, or a painting studio for them to create art.This will help even the shyest child interact more.
 Most children benefit from having some outdoor time each day. Schedule your child’s playdate at a park, or consider going on a walk with the children. Your toddler will have fun and you will be able to get a bit of exercise in.

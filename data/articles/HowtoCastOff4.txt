 The picot cast off creates picots (frilly edges) that are great for cuffs on sleeves and socks, or for blanket edges. Start by casting on two new stitches. Cast on as usual., Knit the first two stitches normally. Insert the needle behind the loop, yarn over, and pull the new loop through as you let the old stitch slip off., Next, you will be binding off with the two new stitches you just made. Take the first stitch in your row and loop it over the second stitch in the row. Slide the first stitch off the needle as you loop it over the second stitch., To create the picots, knit one and then pass the stitch in front of it over the new stitch. Do this a total of three times to create the picots., After your third picot, cast on two stitches again and repeat the process. Keep going until you reach the end of your project.

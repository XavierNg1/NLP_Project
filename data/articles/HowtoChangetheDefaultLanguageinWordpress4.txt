 If your blog's URL is "(yourblogname).wordpress.com", WordPress is your server host as well as the software your blog runs on. In this case, it is very easy to change your language settings as described below.
 Log in to your WordPress account and visit your blog's dashboard. Click Settings in the left-hand pane, then select the language you plan to write in using the drop-down menu.If you do not know how to access your dashboard or you cannot find the settings button, log in to your WordPress account, then navigate to " (yourblogname).wordpress.com/wp-admin/options-general.php ."

, If you would like the settings, alerts, and other user interface messages to be depicted in another language, click Users on the left hand pane, then click Personal Settings on the short list that appears beneath it. Find the "Interface language" option and select your language from the drop-down menu.


Both language settings include a link to the other one directly beneath the option, making it easy to switch between interface language options and blog writing language options.

 If you decide to breed your dog, make sure that you keep its area clean. Wash its bedding regularly, especially if any bodily fluids or foreign substances get on it. Be sure to clean the floors and surfaces of your dog’s living space regularly to prevent a bacterial infection., Once your dog starts lactating, check its teats every day. Look for signs of redness, swelling, or abnormal discharge. These may be indications that your dog has developed an infection., Because puppies can claw at their mother’s teats as they nurse, you will want to clip their toenails to prevent mastitis. Scratches or cuts from the puppies’ nails can become infected, resulting in mastitis. Be sure to groom your puppy properly to prevent the spread of infectious disease., Since mastitis is associated with lactating dogs, preventing pregnancy is also effective at preventing mastitis. Therefore, consider getting your dog spayed.

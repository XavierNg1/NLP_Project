 Pour one tablespoon of cold water over the gelatin and let it sit for a few minutes to soften. Stir until the gelatin has completely dissolved. In a mixing bowl, pour in the cream and beat it with a hand mixer until soft peaks begin to form. Add the gelatin and the sugar, and continue beating until the topping becomes stiff.









Don't overbeat the topping, or it will turn into butter.
You can add a few drops of food coloring to the whipped cream so that it matches your ice cream. For example, if you're making a strawberry ice cream cake, add a few drops of red food coloring to make a pink topping.
 Remove the cake from the freezer. Spread the whipped topping on the cake using an offset spatula. If you wish, spread more topping onto the sides of the cake to hide the layers.









You can decorate the cake with sprinkles, chocolate chips, or fruit if you desire.
For a fancier cake, place the whipped topping in an icing bag and pipe it onto the cake in a pretty pattern.
 Place it back in the freezer to let the topping harden. The cake is ready to serve when the topping is stiff.

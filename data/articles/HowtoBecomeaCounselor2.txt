 If after interviewing a social worker you still want to become a social worker, it is now time to address your schooling. Social workers need a Bachelors degree in social work. In addition, many direct-service social workers and most clinical social workers need a master's degree in Social Work or closely related field .


To find a locale accredited counseling program visit the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs site, www.cacrep.or. Once you identify the master's degree program you would like to attend, figure out what pre-requisites you need to get in, and get them.
Depending on your current level of schooling, and the standing of your credits, you may need to go back and complete a bachelor's degree, or go back as a post-baccalaureate and take just the pre-requisites you need to enter your desired master's degree program.
 Most social workers choose an undergraduate degree in social work. Such a degree usually includes the prerequisites needed for a Master of social work, but it is always important to double check.


You may also decide to get an undergraduate degree in something else, like psychology or sociology, but make sure you have the prerequisites you need for your desired master's degree program.
 Clinical social workers must have a master's degree, usually in social work.
 Before you can become a licensed clinical social worker you need to complete 2 years or 3,000 hours of supervised experience.
 All US states require that social workers obtain state certification. To get certified or licensed consult the Association of Social Works Boards at www.aswb.org.

 Especially if it pains you to even think about them. They're not worth a quick thought.
 If you do something like go to the beach with your best friends, or have a barbecue with your family, you'll be too busy having fun to think about the person.


Go shopping with your BFF or siblings.
 This is something I had a lot of trouble doing. Don't yell at yourself if you still like the person, over time the crush will fade.
 Don't worry, you'll find that perfect person one day. This person was a lesson to be learned from, so watch for the signs of what to avoid in future!

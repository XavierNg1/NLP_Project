 Pancakes are a great way to get your toddler involved in the kitchen. Try measuring out the ingredients and letting your toddler pour them into the mixing bowl. You can also let your toddle stir the ingredients together with a spoon., If your toddler enjoys eating crackers and cheese, create a snack plate together with soft cheeses, fruit, and your kid’s favorite crackers. Let the toddler use a plastic, child-safe knife to cut the soft cheese into snack-sized pieces. They can also help cut soft fruit, like bananas. Then ask your toddler to help you arrange the fruit and cheese on the plate along with the crackers.

Make sure you supervise the toddler while they are using the knife.

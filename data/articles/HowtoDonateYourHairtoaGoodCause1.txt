 Look up organizations that make wigs for people with cancer, Alopecia, etc. Find one that you like and know the requirements for a hair donation. The policies vary amongst organizations, and some may or may not take your hair.


Two organizations, Pantene and CWHL (Children With Hair Loss) accept donations of 8 inches (20.3 cm) or more. Locks of Love and Wigs for Kids accept donations only of 10 and 12 inches, respectively.






If it's curly, pull it straight to measure.

, Make sure your hair is not chemically damaged (dyed repeatedly), very dead (split ends), or dirty, and is at least 8–12 inches (20.3–30.5 cm) long (depending on the organization). Hair like this is often not accepted. Be sure you don't waste your hair or your efforts!


There is a difference between colored and bleached hair. Each organization is different, but just because you've colored your hair doesn't necessarily mean that you're out of the running to help.






Gray hair is appreciated just as much!







, Most organizations have a form online that you can fill out to accompany your donation. If you want to remain completely anonymous you may choose to do so, but if you want verification that your donation was received, this step is necessary.


This may be as simple as including your name and address. And if it takes a couple of months to hear back, don't fret. Sometimes the organizations are running low on help and it takes time to get everything organized. You can always call or inquire online if you're curious.

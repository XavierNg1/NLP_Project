 Place a large saucepan on the stove, and add the water, flour, salt, cornstarch, vegetable oil, and powdered Alum. Turn the heat to medium, and begin stirring with a whisk.
 As the mixture heats up, it will start to thicken. Switch to a wooden spoon so that it doesn't get caught in our whisk., As you continue to stir it, the ingredients will begin to leave the sides of the saucepan and clump together to form a dough. When this happens, turn off the stove, and carefully remove the dough from the saucepan. Set it down onto a smooth working surface., You can make it all one color, or you can split the playdough up into smaller balls, and knead some food coloring into each one. Keep kneading until the food coloring is mixed evenly throughout the playdough. There should be no streaks or swirls; the color should be even.


If you are working with one big ball, start with just three drops of food coloring. If you are working with smaller balls, start with one drop. A little bit goes a long way!
The more food coloring you add, the darker your playdough will become.
 If the playdough's texture is not quite right for you, you can still fix it. Knead in a little more cornstarch or flour if it is too wet or sticky. If it is too dry, knead in some water. Lastly, if the playdough is too light in color for you, add a few more drops of food coloring.
 You can make little figures with it, or roll it out and cut shapes out using cookie cutters. When you are done playing with it, put it into an airtight container so that it doesn't dry out.

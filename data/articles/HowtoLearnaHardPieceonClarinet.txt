 If you come across an unfamiliar rhythm, try to figure it out, or ask someone to explain it to you.;
, Even in a very difficult piece of music, there's bound to be a half note or two. Even playing those will give you somewhere to work from.
 Figure out how fast you can play the hardest section of the music and practice the whole thing at that tempo. Continue increasing tempos until you can play the whole piece at the marked tempo. A metronome may be helpful for this.
 You're likely to find themes and rhythms that repeat, which will help you a lot once you get them down.
 Since most people practice starting at the beginning and slowly learning the rest, the beginning ends up being great, but the piece deteriorates as you play through it. If you learn from both ends and work to the middle, any parts you don't know as well might be more easily overlooked, because of your solid beginning and ending.
 If you take lessons, get your teacher to help you with the piece, or enlist the help of a band director, friend, or other person with more musical experience than you.
 A professional performance may add great insight into how the piece should be performed.

,, Use a stud finder to search for wall studs. If possible, find two studs and secure the bookcase with two straps to ensure a good hold.


Secure the bookcase into wall studs whenever possible, instead of using wall anchors.
It is best to secure the bookcase without the books in it, and then fill it up once you are finished.

 Peel back the clear cover from the sticky adhesive and press the strap onto the top of the bookcase. For best results, don’t remove the adhesive strip to realign, or it may lose some of its hold.

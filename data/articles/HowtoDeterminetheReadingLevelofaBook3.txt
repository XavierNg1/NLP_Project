 Make sure to pick 10 from the beginning, 10 from the middle, and 10 from the end of the book. It is important that you choose sentences from all parts of the book, as that will give you a much more accurate idea of the level of the book., Go through your chosen sentences and circle all words that have three or more syllables. This will include repetitions of the same word. Tally these words up. Count:


Hyphenated words as one word.
Long numbers that are spelled out.
Abbreviations as if they were spelled out completely., Take the total number of 3-syllable words in the 30 sentences you selected and calculate the square root. Round the square root to the nearest whole number.To give you an example, if your 30 sentences had 45 3-syllable words, the square root would be 6.7. Round this to 7.
You can calculate square root by hand or by calculator.
 After you round the square root to the nearest whole number, youâ€™ll need to add 3 to that number. This will give you the SMOG grade level (reading level) of the book you choose.


For example, if you had 45 3-syllable words with a square root of 6.7, you should round that to 7, and then add three. This will give you a SMOG grade level of 10. This means the book is appropriate for children in the 10th grade.

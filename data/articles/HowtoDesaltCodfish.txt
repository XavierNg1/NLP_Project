 The pieces of salted cod are covered with a large amount of salt. So it is recommended before the desalination process begins, to clean the cod under running water, rubbing with your fingers the outermost layer of the cod salt.;
, Fill a container with cold water. It should have three parts of water to one part of cod. Introduce the cod into the container and place the container in the refrigerator.
 When the cod has soaked for 12 hours, remove the water from the container. Refill it with fresh cold water and put it back in the refrigerator for another 12 hours.
 After the first 24 hours you must repeat the process two more times, four changes of water separated by 12 hours apart, this way the cod will be soaked for a total of 72 hours or three days.


If the cod is shredded, not whole, the first 24 hours of soaking should be enough.
 Once you have finished with the desalting process, cod will be in perfect condition to be used in the kitchen and you can enjoy its great taste.

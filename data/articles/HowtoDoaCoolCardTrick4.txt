 This is very important for you to remember these (and their order) before you begin. Lets say it's an Ace of Clubs and a 3 of Diamonds for the sake of example.
 Tell her to memorize it and then put it back on top. Does she remember what it is? Is there anyway it was a different card? Act like this is a big deal to begin distracting her.
 This means you "shuffle" the cards, but make sure your Ace of Clubs and 3 of Diamonds stay on top. So she doesn't notice your poor shuffling job, maybe ask, "How's your day?" or "Is this your first time being part of a magic trick?" or something along those lines.


The number one thing to concern yourself with when performing a card trick is to remain as confident as possible. Smile, be funny, and engage. Distraction (and entertainment) is everything.
 In other words, cut the deck. Now the two cards are together and just somewhere randomly in the deck. If you'd like, have your friend do it to increase your credibility and limit the likelihood of you tampering with the deck.
 Keep feeling or massaging cards until you get to the 3 of diamonds. Massage the Ace, getting ready to make the big reveal.


Again, turn it into a production. Draw out the amount of time you feel the cards, making it a little ridiculous and funny. Get excited over certain cards that aren't right, and then brush it off as a false alarm. They're there for a show, not just for a card flip.
 Alternatively, you could do it on the 3 of Diamonds, too, saying, "This next card will be yours!" And then take the Ace and show her it. When you ask her if this is indeed her card, of course she'll say yes.


Sometimes it's funny to pass the person's card. You could go through all the cards, flipping them over, exclaiming that you foiled the trick. Then, all of a sudden, you have a vision. You then pull out their card from the discard pile, goading them along this entire time.

 In this hyper-connected time, there are numerous ways in which you can choose to reach a recruiter after you meet them at a career fair. You may choose from the following methods:


Send a text message in the same format as that of a business letter. Keep it short and concise, and simply mention that you are grateful for the recruiter's time.
You may also choose to send them an email at their official email company email address.
Send a traditional handwritten thank-you note, along with a copy of your resume.;
, Send an invitation to connect with the recruiter you spoke to via Linkedin.


Write a short thank you note attached to your invitation.
This way, you can explore chances to learn about the organization and your recruiter.
 Make sure you respond promptly with a thank you note immediately after the career fair is over. You should respond no later than 24 hours from the end of the career fair.


This is because the recruiter's memory will still be fresh soon after meeting you.
Additionally, you will be able to reference your conversation with the recruiter accurately, because you won't have forgotten anything.
 To make your note more personal, try writing a handwritten note.


This may be appreciated by employers, as it shows that you made a special effort to show your interest in the organization.
If you had a noteworthy discussion with your employer at some point during the career fair, reference that as well.
 Never try to write a long story, because overly long notes take too much time to read and can cause the recruiter to lose interest.


Be specific and make sure your letter runs for no more than three paragraphs.
Reference the key points you discussed with the recruiter. This tells him or her that you paid attention to the discussion.
It gives an impression that you take things seriously and are a good learner.

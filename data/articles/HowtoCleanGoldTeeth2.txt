 If you have a removable gold tooth, you should clean it daily. You should do this with a non-abrasive cleaner. After cleaning it, you should rinse the tooth with warm water and pat dry.Talk to your dentist about the proper cleaner. You can buy cleansers specifically designed for cleaning gold teeth online.
 After you have cleaned your tooth, make sure you pat it dry. Then, use a soft cloth to polish your tooth before placing it back in your mouth. This helps the tooth retain its shine and luster.Try a soft cotton microfiber cloth.
 If you have gold teeth, you should stop smoking. Smoking will tarnish your gold tooth and cause it to lose its shine. If you don’t want to quit smoking, then you should choose a higher quality gold for your tooth.For example, you should choose 18 or 24 karat gold if you want to continue smoking. It won’t tarnish as quickly as lower quality.
 Though you may think that cleaning your solid gold or gold-plated teeth with jewelry cleaner is a good idea, it is not. Jewelry cleaners are toxic when ingested. This means you should never clean your gold teeth with jewelry cleaners.Additionally, you should never use gold polish on gold teeth.

 Check various locations that have faucets. The kitchen, the bathroom, basement and outdoor faucets, and hose hookups are common areas where fixture specific low water pressure can occur.
Run water in all faucets and showers in your home to identify if there is are one or multiple problem problem areas or to determine that all locations have low water pressure.
Run both hot and cold water through all faucets. If your water pressure is low only with hot water, the issue is likely your water heater.;
, Your problem might only affect one or two locations. In this case, the source of the low water pressure is likely a clogged faucet or aerator. Remove the end of the faucet.
Examine your aerator. Check to make sure there are no debris or buildup.
If the aerator needs to be cleaned, soak it in a water-vinegar solution. If that doesn't work, buy a replacement. These are very inexpensive.Turn the water on before you replace the aerator. If the water flow is not restored to normal, the source of low water pressure is likely not the specific faucet but an overall problem.
 If you can't pinpoint the cause of your low water pressure to just one or two faucets in the house, its probably an overall problem.


Check the PRV and water shut off valves in your home. This is often the cause of low water pressure.
Look for water leaks. A leaking toilet or water main can cause low water pressure.
Check your water heater. If you only have low water pressure when you are running hot water, it is likely due to your hot water shut-off valve on your water heater.

 Don’t just ask any coworker. Ensure they are interested by reading their body language. If they are giving you signals that they may be interested in you, then proceed.


These signals can be direct, like maintaining eye contact, smiling, or touching you while they speak. Or, they can be indirect, like touching their hair, neck, or face while talking to you.
If they adopt closed body language, for example, turning away from you, avoiding eye contact, or any contact at all, then chances are they are not interested.
If you are truly unsure if your coworker is interested, do not fret. You can try more direct contact like asking for their phone number to see how they react. Or, you could try telling them a joke to see if they laugh, and perhaps a conversation could start from there.
 Make your advances confidential. This will gain your coworker’s trust and increase your rate of success.


Do not make any big moves at the office, like being overly flirty, or suggesting you do something during work hours or at the office. This will likely scare them away.
 Before you attempt to ask them, get to know them first. Try to find things you have in common with your coworker besides work. Ask them about their hobbies or what they like to do on the weekend.
Ask them what their favorite foods are, or ask them about the different places they have traveled to or would like to travel to.

 Don’t think of class as boring. Waste time by telling yourself that class is fun. If you trick your brain into thinking that you’re having fun studies have shown that it will seem like time is moving faster., Sit somewhere different or take notes in cursive. If you stimulate yourself in different ways studies have shown that you can trick your brain into thinking that time is moving faster than it actually is.Don’t change your seat if it has been assigned to you, if you have vision or hearing problems, or if you know the location is worse than the original.
 Make a game out of class. Keep score on how many questions you ask or can answer from the teacher. You will get energized from your sense of accomplishment. You may set a larger challenge like getting the teacher to use movie analogies to help you understand the subject., Day dream and let your fantasy wander. Studies have shown that brief escapes into imagination may speed up how we perceive time. Create stories or think about whatever you wish.

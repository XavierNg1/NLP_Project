 This method is create for those pairs of jeans that are just a little bit too short. The trim will help your jeans look longer. It will also act as an embellishment or decoration. Depending on how wide your trim is, you can make your jeans quite a bit longer. Here's a list of what you will need:


Jeans
Tape measure
Trim (lace, ribbon, ruffle, etc)
Scissors
Thread
Sewing machine or sharp needle
Sewing pins

, You will be sewing the trim to the bottom of the jean cuff using a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance, so make sure that your trim is wide enough. Here are some things you can use as a trim:


Crocheted lace
Regular, scalloped-edge lace
Embroidered ribbon
Ruffled fabric

, Make sure you are measuring inside the pant leg. Jeans are thick, especially along the bottom cuff. Place a tape measure inside the leg and measure all the way around the bottom hem. Start and end at the inseam.
 If the fabric is very delicate and frays a lot, you can seal off the ends with some super glue, fabric glue, clear nail polish, or fray check.
 Make sure that you are sewing the right side together. You can sew by hand using a running stitch, or on a sewing machine. Tie the ends off into a tight knot and snip off any excess thread.
 If you want, you can press the inside seam flat with an iron.
 The top edge of your trim and the bottom cuff should be overlapping by no more than ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).
 Make sure that you are using a thread color that matches your jeans. When you are done, remove the pins and tie the ends into tight knots. Snip the excess thread off.


You can sew the trim on using a sewing machine or a sharp needle and thread.
 Your jeans are now a little bit longer and fancier than before.

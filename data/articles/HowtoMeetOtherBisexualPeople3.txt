 Before directly asking if someone is bisexual, pay attention to signals that indicate their sexual orientation, such as body language. Does the person you are watching show a lot of affection to the same sex? Watching body language can tell you a lot about a person.


Watch their eyes for signs of attraction to both same-sex people and those of the opposite sex.For example, their pupils will dilate if they are attracted to you.
 Watch someone you suspect is bisexual and see how much affection they show. Are they open to hugging both sexes? Do they talk about liking both sexes? For example, a bisexual person might claim to be straight but go out of their way to meet with members of the same sex.


Sometimes women will be bisexual and not realize it. Studies show that about 60% of women are attracted to the same sex, and that women become more bicurious when they age., When you walk into a social situation where you are looking for bisexual people, you should talk to people in order to determine if they are also bisexual. You might share information about what you are interested in so that the other person feels comfortable sharing their sexual orientation.
 Be sure not to make any assumptions about someone else's sexuality. For instance, don't assume that someone is bisexual just because they hug someone of both genders at a party. To be certain someone is bisexual, you should talk to them about this with sensitivity and tact.


You could start a conversation about this by saying, "I heard you say something that made me think you might like the same things I do. Do you want to chat?"

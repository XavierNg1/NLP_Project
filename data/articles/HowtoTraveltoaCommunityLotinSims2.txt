 Choose the "Taxi" option.;
, If you have community lots in your neighborhood, it will be listed. If you have the Nightlife Expansion Pack, "Downtown" will also be listed.
 The game will tell you that a taxi will be arriving shortly.
 Your Sim will then walk outside and enter the taxi. The destination will load up once the taxi disappears off the lot.

 Start by making a long horizontal line on a piece of paper.


This will be the base of your number line.
 This will make your line look like a train track.


You will need to make more hashmarks on the line than for a simple addition/subtraction problem if you are working with negative numbers.
 Put zero on the hashmark in the center of your line.


Put 1 to the right of zero and -1 to the left of zero. -2 will go to the left of -1 and so on.
 Zero should be in the middle.


Try numbering up to 20 on the right and -20 on the left.

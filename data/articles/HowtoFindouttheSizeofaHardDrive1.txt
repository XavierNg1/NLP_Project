, Look for the "Storage and iCloud Usage" tab.


For Android, find the "Storage" tab and select it., Under "Storage" (which covers your phone's internal hard drive) and "iCloud" (which covers your online-based cloud storage), you can see how much memory you are currently using and how much is remaining.


If you have an Android with an SD card, you'll have a drive option for your phone's internal storage as well as the card. These different drives are under "Internal Storage" and "SD Card", respectively.
 This will tell you your hard drive's total capacity for file storage


Note that a portion of the hard drive is dedicated to the operating system and other non-retrievable system files, so your actual total space won't quite match the number associated with your phone model (e.g. 32GB, 64GB)
You can also view your phone's effective storage capacity and currently available space under the "About" tab in the "General" menu.
 This feature shows you how memory is being used by apps, images, or other information.


Use this feature to clear up space. For example, if you see that several gigabytes of your used space come from saved conversations, you can free up that space by deleting those conversations.

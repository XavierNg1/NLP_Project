 Either low grit sandpaper or scotch bright pads are abrasive enough to remove a scratch from a stainless steel sink. Pick up sandpaper or pads at a department or hardware store if you want to use this method to remove a scratch.Sandpaper is usually the best option for very deep, noticeable scratches while bright pads work better for light scratches.
 Rub the pad or sandpaper against the scratch, going in the direction of the sink's grain. Use even, long streaks as you buff out the stain. Keep going until the scratch fades away., You need to be applying pressure evenly across your sandpaper or pad for this method to work. When using sandpaper, it can help to wrap your sandpaper around a wood block to help distribute the pressure evenly.

 If you are only dyeing one or two table runners, you can use two cups of water per bucket. If you are doing a large batch of linens, you can adjust the amount of water based on the instructions of your fabric dye.Heat the water in a kettle or microwave until it is at least 140 °F (60 °C)., If you are using powdered or liquid dye, you should read the instructions on the packaging to determine how to prepare it. In general, you will mix the dye with water, adding either salt or vinegar based on the type of fabric you will be using. You should make up to four cups of dye. Mix the dye in a separate bowl, pitcher, or large measuring cup.

You should adjust the amount of dye for the vibrancy that you want in your table runner. Darker or brighter colors will need more dye. Lighter or pastel colors will need less dye.
For cotton, rayon and linen fabrics, mix in one cup salt of salt. For silk and nylon fabrics, stir in one cup of white vinegar., Each bucket will have a different concentration of dye. For the first bucket, use ¼ cup of dye. For the second, use ½ cup of dye, and for the third, use one full cup of dye., Using a rag, scrap of fabric, or paper towel, test the color of each dye bucket. Dip the test strip into the bucket, rinse out excess dye, and let it dry. Remember that the color may change slightly when it dries, so it is good wait until the test strip has dried to see what color emerges.You can even practice getting the ombre effect. Dip the test strip in each bucket to see how the colors blend into one another.
It is recommended that you wear gloves as you dip into the dye to protect your hands and any other surfaces that you touch.

 Consider your interests, abilities and the available free time you have first, then decide which activities suit you best.For example, if you want to make a difference in your middle school, consider student government. If you like running you can join the cross-country team. There are more opportunities than ever to try new things in middle school, so take advantage of them.
 Some teams that can only have a certain number of players still need team managers that can support the team while they work on improving their skills.
 Academic clubs are a great way to learn more while making friends and having fun. There are clubs for science, art, music, history, math and more. You will get to spend time with teachers that know a lot about the subjects they teach and other students that share your interests.
 Middle schools will have school dances, shows and other events for students to attend and socialize.It's a great opportunity to make new friends and to showcase your talents.
 Make plans with your friends to meet up with them during lunch time. The cafeteria is a good time to socialize, so make sure you let your friends know you plan to spend your lunch with them before the lunch period. This way you can save them a seat, or they can save one from you. Being with friends makes lunch much more enjoyable than sitting with strangers or eating alone.

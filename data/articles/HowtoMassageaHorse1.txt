 This may not make sense at first but horses are very perceptive when it comes to human emotions. So a calm you equals a calm horse. If you feel agitated, wait to perform the massage at another time.Before you begin to brush your horse, gently rub under his eyes with your index and middle fingers in circular motions. This will gain trust and keep him calm.;
, This is a good move to help loosen up the muscles in the horse’s back/spine region. Make sure you position your horse so that the hind foot on the side you are working on is slightly behind the foot on the other side; this will position the muscles properly.Use your palm directly on the muscle, pushing in gently and releasing. Your touch should be soft, but firm.
Work your way down the muscles. If the muscle does not give under the pressure of your touch, then it is tight and needs working on.
If your horse moves away from you, this probably means that the method is working because horses instinctually move away from pain. So if the muscle is tight and you put pressure on it, this will probably be a little uncomfortable for your horse.
 This method is beneficial for spreading out condensed muscle fibers and increasing blood flow in the muscle tissue. Begin in the middle of the horse’s back, just behind the withers.Use the open palm of your hand to apply moderate pressure compressions in a rhythmic pumping action.
Continue this pattern as you gradually work your way down the length of the muscle towards the back of the horse.
 This is a type of gliding stroke typically used down a horse’s spine to help massage stiff and sore muscles. Make sure you stand behind the stroke so that you can use your weight to lean into the horse.Take the open palm of your hand (you can use one or both hands at a time) and stroke down the horse’s back in a gliding motion.
Make sure you lighten the pressure if you go over any bony areas.

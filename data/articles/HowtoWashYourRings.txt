 You will need:


a toothbrush
hot water
toothpaste
rubbing alcohol
paper towel
a small cup;
, Turn the faucet on and have the running water be warm. Warm water is good for killing bacteria and cleaning stains. Make sure it is not unbearably hot as it can burn your skin and damage your ring.
 Make sure you fill the cup with the hot water. When the hot water warms up, grab the ring and take it out. By doing this you removed dust, easy removable stains and bacteria.
, Toothpaste is good for sterling silver and white gold.
 Turn the water from hot to warm.
 Dump the hot water from the cup into the sink.
 This will disinfect the ring(s). This process will kill off any bacteria and remove stains. This will also make the zirconia diamond in your ring very shiny. Make sure you leave the ring in the cup with the solution for a few hours.
 This is the last step you are going to do. If you feel the ring can use more shine repeat the steps or use a shiner.

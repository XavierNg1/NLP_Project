 This random event takes place close to the tattoo parlor on the corner of El Rancho Boulevard and Sustancia Road. Once you are there, a blue blip will appear on your radar and you’ll hear a woman cry out for help.If that doesn’t happen, the random event isn’t occurring and you should come back at a later time, or with another character.;
, She is leading you into an ambush, so be prepared to re-equip a weapon. If you are carrying a weapon when you approach her, she will walk away and tell you that she doesn’t need that kind of help. Doing that will cause the random event to become unavailable, but you can come back later or with another character to trigger the event again., They will all be firing pistols, so you may want to take cover. The corner of the house is a good place to take cover. The best choice of weapon is a shotgun, as you’ll be at close range to the gang members. Once they have been eliminated, walk over their bodies to gather their ammo and the money they dropped—anywhere from $500 to $1000.


If you kill the woman as well, you will get a one-star wanted level and will need to outrun the police before the random event will be considered complete.

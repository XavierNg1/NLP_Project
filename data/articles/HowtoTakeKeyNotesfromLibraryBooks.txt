 Reading well in the first place will help keep your reading and your notes about it relevant.;
, Keep a notebook.


Take notes on your computer or phone only if you can use it without being distracted.
Start notes about a particular passage with a page number, and perhaps the heading or opening words of the passage, so you can find the passage again quickly.
 Insert your notes between pages, to mark relevant passages.



Make sure your notes or tags can be removed. Try them first on a piece of scrap paper if you're not sure.
Write on the sticky notes if you choose to. Let the ink dry before attaching them.



Be selective; don't overdo it and copy the whole book.
Remember, you can use most digital cameras, including the ones on smartphones, to scan a page.

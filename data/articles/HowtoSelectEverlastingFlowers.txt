 Look for plants that are interesting in shape, texture or colour once dried. In addition, consider how successfully a plant will dry; it needs to retain its shape and not fall apart or disintegrate. The parts of a plant suitable for everlasting arrangements include flowers, seeds, seed pods, reeds, leaves and stems.;
, There is a variety of plants suitable to choose for everlasting flower arrangements. Examples of suitable plants include:

Queen Anne's lace







Honesty (Lunaria)







Bells of Ireland (Molucella)







Love-in-a-mist (Nigella)







Statice







Xeranthemum







Banksia







Protea







Eucalyptus leaves







Straw flowers







Hydrangea







,
If you intend to grow the plants in your own garden, choose the seeds that you need. Plant them according to the instructions.






If you do not have access to the plant seeds, or they will not grow quickly enough (for example, eucalyptus leaves, banksia etc.), seek the relevant plant elements from a florist, nursery etc. Sometimes plant and flower wholesalers might be able to help you out.
 When growing your own or when purchasing fresh flowers, cut flower stems just before flowers are fully developed. Tie the flowers in bunches and hang these upside down in a well ventilated place until dried. It is usually best to cut seed pods and seeds after they have dried on the plant stems.
 Design the arrangement on paper according to the plant elements that you have available. Follow the design when putting together your arrangement. Display when completed.

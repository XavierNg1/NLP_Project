 This will show your parents that you're actually ashamed of your behavior and that you're really thinking it over, determined not to do it again. If you smirk at them, give them a defiant stare, or look bored or annoyed, then they'll be even more angry at you. Though nobody likes being scolded, you should show them that you understand what you did wrong. If you're able to do that, you'll make them proud, even if they're still angry. It may be hard to believe this, but your parents don't like to scold you all the time either.
 When your parents are angry about something you did and are in the middle of telling you why they're disappointed, it's not the time to talk back, interrupt, or generally be disrespectful. Sure, you may want to tell them your side of the story, but you don't want to interrupt them when they're trying to tell you something. It's for your own good. Remember, there's a time and a place for everything.
 If you feel they don't understand the situation, give them some time to cool off before you go and tell them what you really think. If they ask you to tell them your side on the spot, that's fine, however if they look frustrated or need some space, give it to them instead of continuing a conversation they don't want to have. They'll be proud of you for recognizing that they want to be left alone and will be more receptive to the fact that you realized they need some private time.


When they look ready, you can calmly and politely tell them your side of the story.
 Nobody's perfect, and it's much better to admit you've made a mistake than to be in denial or be mean and petty about it. If you say you're sorry, look your parents in the eyes and promise not to do it again and really mean it. That will definitely make your parents proud. They don't expect you to be perfect, but what they do expect is for you to accept responsibility when you're in the wrong. This is a big part of being a mature individual with self-knowledge.

 As pillbugs require a damp environment to thrive, you should pick a container that's resistant to water. Go with something made of plastic or glass rather than cardboard.


You can purchase an aquarium at a pet store if you have a lot of pillbugs.If you don't want to spend the money on an aquarium, you can use a plastic tupperware container from your kitchen to house your pillbugs.;
, Once you've secured a container, you can begin creating the proper environment for your pillbugs.


Fill the bottom of the container with one to one and half inches of moist soil or sand. You can purchase sand or soil from a pet store or greenhouse.
Pillbugs also enjoy wood bark, leaf litter, and other dead vegetation as part of their habitat., Pillbugs need to live in a ventilated container. Make sure you're able to place small holes on the top of the container, but not too big that pillbugs can escape. Many aquariums come with ventilated lids and you can easily poke holes in the top of a tupperware lid.

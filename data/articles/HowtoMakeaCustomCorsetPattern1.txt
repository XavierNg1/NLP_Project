 You'll need to measure the following:


Bust
Waist: This measurement should be taken at the natural waist, near your bellybutton.
Waist to Underarm Measurement: Starting at your side, measure the distance from your waist to an inch or so beneath the armpit or to the top edge of your bra.
Center Front: This will be the height in the front. A good starting length is 12 inches (30.5Â cm), but you may need more or less depending on your back waist length. This length will increase or decrease depending on the style of corset you want as well.;

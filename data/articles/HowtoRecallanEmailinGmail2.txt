 Boomerang is an extension that, among other things, allows you to schedule your emails to send at a later time.


Visit www.boomeranggmail.com/download.html in the browser that you want to install it in. Boomerang is not compatible with Internet Explorer or Edge, or with mobile browsers.
Boomerang will not be able to recall any messages that you've sent before installing it. It will only allow you to delay sending of future messages so that you have a chance to recall.
 This will begin installing the extension in your browser.
 The process is slightly different depending on your browser:


Chrome - Click the "Add" button that appears.
Firefox - Click "Allow" and then "Install Now."
Safari - Click the "Install" button that appears.
 If Gmail is already open in a tab, you'll need to close it and reopen it. You'll see a new "Boomerang" button in the upper-right corner when you have a message open, next to the "More" button.
 This will open a new message window, and you'll see the new "Send Later" button underneath the "Send" button.
 This will open a menu with various times that you can set for the message to be sent., If you're often wanting to recall a message just a few minutes after sending it, select "In 1 hour" or enter a custom time of a few minutes. This will send the message to your Boomerang Outbox to be sent later.
 If you decide you need to recall an email message, you'll find it in the Boomerang-Outbox folder as long as it hasn't automatically sent.
 You'll see the message open with a striped background, and several options along the top.
 It will be removed from the automatic queue and will not be sent to the recipient.

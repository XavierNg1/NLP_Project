 Add ⅔ cup (165 g) of whole-milk yogurt, 1 finely grated clove of garlic, 2 teaspoons (30 ml) of fresh lemon juice, ½ teaspoon (3 ½ g) of honey, and 3 ounces (85 g) of crumbled blue cheese to a medium bowl. Stir the ingredients together well with a spoon, making sure to break up the cheese.Don’t use Greek yogurt in this recipe. Plain yogurt is the best option.
 After you’ve prepared the yogurt mixture, add some kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. It’s a good idea to taste the mixture so you know how much salt and pepper that you want to mix in., Once you’ve seasoned the yogurt mixture, take the leaves from 2 heads of Little Gem lettuce and place a 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 g) of the mixture in the center of the leaves. Next, use 6 ounces (170 g) of cooked and chopped bacon and the remaining 3 ounces (85 g) of crumbled blue cheese to top all of the lettuce boats.You can use the spoon to spread the yogurt mixture slightly to ensure that it’s evenly distributed across the center of the leaves.
 Once you’ve filled all of the lettuce boats, arrange them on a serving platter. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons (6 g) of finely chopped chives over the lettuce boats for garnish. Add several lemon wedges to the platter so you can squeeze them over the boats when serving.You can omit the chives if you prefer.

 Will it be electric? Will it be a sports car? Have a brainstorm. Remember, be sure what kind of car you want it to be.;
, Do it from all angles. Top, side, front, back. If you don't like your sketches, then think of something else.
 Use things around the house to draw wheels. E.g Beakers, Lids. If you can't find one the right size, then why not buy some drafting tools. You can get these from all online supermarkets. E.g Amazon, E-Bay.
 If you're lucky you might be able to buy some computer equipment so that you can design your car in 3D.
 Remember, don't make it out of expensive materials unless you know that you will be able to afford it and still make a profit.

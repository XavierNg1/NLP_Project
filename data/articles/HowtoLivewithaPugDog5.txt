 Buy doggie steps or figure out some way for your pug to get up on your bed or high furniture easily. The steps will save you a fortune in vet bills later on, for too much jumping up and down will weaken joints and hips., Keep them leashed when around pit bulls, rotties, bovines, horses, buffalo, wolves, or grizzly bears. They really are unaware of their weight class. They will want to protect you at any cost.
 You will want to rotate your pug's toys so that they can be brought in at intervals as "new" toys to keep your dog's interest. You should take care and make sure your pug doesn't chew toys and swallow small pieces.
 Let your pug dog lick you whenever he or she wants. It really is one of the few ways they know how to show how much they love you. A pug dog loves you more than you can ever imagine.


Speak gently to your pug and coo to it often. It will come back to you twofold.
Pugs are very funny and the will make you smile, when you are in a bad mood. Indeed, the best way to live with a pug dog is to love your pug with all your heart. Your pug loves you - love it back.
A pug always loves a scratch behind the ear and of course a tummy scratch too!

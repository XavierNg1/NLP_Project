 Follow the same method as Baguettes up to when the rectangle is rolled out and folded in half, once.
 Turn the cylinder of dough over and pinch the seam and gently roll with your hands from the middle out to make a shorter and fatter loaf. To make a Vienna loaf shape, the bread should be noticeably fatter in the middle and this is done using very light pressure applied to the ends of a round loaf so it makes an oval shape.
 Leave the bread seam side up for undecorated breads for at least an hour, or until doubled in size. Slash or carve an attractive pattern into the bread with a razor and bake.
 Follow the same method as baguettes, splashing a little water into the oven to generate steam. When cooked, the bread should be lightweight and sound hollow when tapped at the base. Leave in the switched off oven to further crisp if desired.

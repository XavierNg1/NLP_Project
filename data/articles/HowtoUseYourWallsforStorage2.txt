 Use old milk crates, wooden boxes, or wire baskets to add wall storage to any room. Hang them open side up like a regular container, or hang them open side out as a shelf. Secure the boxes to the wall by screwing them into studs or using curved wall hooks.This is a versatile option because it works with any type of basket, box, or crate. The material of the basket will determine what hanging method works best.
For wooden crates, screwing them into studs is a good option. Wire baskets can be hung from hooks.
 Spice racks are not only for the kitchen. They provide storage for toys, books, school papers, and more. Buy three or four wooden spice racks and attach them in a vertical row to your child’s wall. Try to screw the racks into studs whenever possible.If you want to get more creative, paint each rack a different color. Then use a stencil to paint words. Designate one rack for each child, or a rack for books, one for toys, and one for odds and ends.
 Buy a board that’s about ½ inch thick (1.3 cm) and two to three feet long. Drill one hole in each end of the wider part of the board. Feed a piece of rope through each hole, knotting it under the board. Screw hook screws into wall studs and tie the rope around the hooks.The shelf can be as long you want, but may require more rope and hooks for a longer shelf.
Always use caution when using power tools.

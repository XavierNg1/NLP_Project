 You can share photos and videos to a Skype contact through the Instant Messaging (IM) feature. If you’re not already signed in to Skype, launch the app and enter your account information when prompted.


Files can only be sent to your confirmed Skype contacts.
 Now you’ll see a list of all of your Skype contacts.
 An IM window will appear, containing a text box that says “Type a message here.”, If you’re not on a call, you should see an icon that looks like a sheet of paper with its right corner folded down.


If you don’t see this icon, click the paperclip first to show all icons.
 To send more than one photo or video, hold down Ctrl as you click additional files.


You will not be able to send an individual photo or video that is larger than 300 MB.
If you’d rather record a new video message, right-click your contact in the Contacts list and select “Send Video Message.” Follow the prompts to record your message, then click Send (an envelope icon).
 The photo or video will now appear in the IM conversation. Your contact can double-click the file to see it full-size and download it using their computer’s default software.
 If you’re on a voice or video call, you can send a file without hanging up.


Click the + icon in the call window and click “Select File.”
Click to select the photo or video you want to send. To select more than one file, hold down Ctrl as you click additional items.
Click “Open” to send the file. The photo or video is now available for download in the IM window.

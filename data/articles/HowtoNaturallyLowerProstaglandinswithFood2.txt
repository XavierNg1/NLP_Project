 Talk to your doctor prior to making any dietary changes or adding dietary supplements. This is especially true if you're trying to treat or manage a current health condition.


Talk to your doctor specifically about what foods you're planning on adding or removing from your diet, why you're changing your diet and how you think they'll benefit your health.
Also check with your doctor about appropriate dosages that will be safe and healthy for you.
While many of foods and supplements have shown a wide range of health benefits, they may interact with your current medications or health conditions in a negative way.
 A meal plan will be helpful when trying to add specific foods to your diet. It can help you see where you can incorporate a variety of anti-inflammatory foods throughout each day and week.


Start adding different foods slowly each week. It may be easier to maintain compared to forcing yourself to fit in a large quantity of new foods to your diet all at once.
Also try choosing foods that you can include everyday. It might be easy to include a hot mug of green tea every morning as a first step.
Remember, you don't have to include every anti-inflammatory food each day. Choose a variety to include over your entire week.
 Some anti-inflammatory foods, like ginger, garlic and onions, will be easier to include in your recipes. You can consume them raw, but it might not be as appetizing compared to incorporating them into recipes.


Many different cuisines regularly use foods and spices that have anti-inflammatory properties. Indian cuisine is known for it's use of turmeric, where as Italian cuisine features a lot of garlic.
Try researching different recipes online or check for cookbooks that feature recipes that focus on anti-inflammatory foods.

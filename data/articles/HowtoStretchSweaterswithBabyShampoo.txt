 Most sweaters can endure either a little hand washing, however a quick check of the tag will ensure you won’t destroy the sweater with this washing attempt.;
, Well water can transform the sweater’s color so using bottled, purified or distilled water might be your best bet.
 If the water is too cold, it may not do the job with getting the sweater to stretch; too hot and you may damage the sweater fibers.
 Use your hands to do the mixing, as you want the shampoo to be well distributed throughout the tub water.
 Use your hands to swish sweater around in the water and then allow it to sit in the water for a few minutes (no need to soak this overnight unless you are trying to remove a stain).
 Rolling the sweater in the towel will help to remove residual water.
 Never crumple the sweater or else it will get/smell moldy. Also, a humid area will only harbor bacteria on your sweater so its imperative you locate a place that is cool and dry.

 Use the two paper pattern circles you've already cut out earlier, to make the following amounts of felt petals:


Following the 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) circle, cut out 20 small pieces of felt.
Following the 3.5 centimeter (1.4 in) felt, cut out 30 larger pieces of felt.
 You'll now have a pile of semi-circle felt petals.

 The swag-o-meter is probably the most important part in the entire pretty boy swag set up. A swag-o-meter is a mental bar which tells you how high your pretty boy swag is. The higher, the better. Keep up your swag-o-meter by competing against other pretty boys in sporting events, for girls, or anything else you can think of. This is like a very public form of confidence.
 Even if you’re trying something new or different, be super confident about it. Strut your stuff to the world and own whatever it is that you’re doing at all times . Be confident in the things that you like and other people won’t see anything wrong with it. Trying to hide things or feeling self conscious about the stuff you do isn’t a part of having swag. You should just assume that everything you do is great. It’s a wonderful way to live your life.
 Don’t just copy everyone else. Put your own personal flair on things. Swag is about looking unique and confident, rolling around with a sort of easy confidence. It's a lot harder to stand out if you’re just trying to look like everyone else. Put your own flavor on it.
 Having pretty boy swag doesn't mean you have to be self centered or act like a womanizer. Just be confident and happy with your style and be kind to other people!

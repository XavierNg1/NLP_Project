 Pretty simple, point your gun at him.
 Aim at his head or chest. Now simply lay down down, scope in/use the iron-sights and fire. If the enemy is really close, as in about 3–5 feet (0.9–1.5 m), don't even bother with the iron sights as he should be dead within 2 seconds if you are hitting him.
Light machine guns, or weapons that don't have automatic. Start shooting in his direction. If he is 30 feet (9.1 m) or more away, lay down, scope in and then just try to get as many head shots as possible, or chest shots, while using full automatic. If he is really close like 3–10 feet (0.9–3.0 m), start firing, be sure to have the gun pointed at him, then lay down while strafing. It doesn't matter what direction you strafe, just don't strafe into a wall. While strafing you can lay down, get back up and basically do whatever you can to avoid being shot back. The common strategy for the opposing player will probably to lay down, so it should be fairly easy to keep your aim on them.
For a pistol you really got to focus on getting head shots, you only have 15 shots so you really got to make them count.
For a sub machine gun you can just point and shoot. Strafe around your target and keep firing.

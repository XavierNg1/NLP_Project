 The first day of the last menstrual cycle is actually considered the first day of pregnancy.


Marking this date on your calendar will also help you determine the date of conception.
Fertilization is most likely to occur about 2 weeks after your last menstrual cycle. You are unlikely to experience symptoms until about 2 to 3 weeks after week 1.;
,


The first symptom you may notice in week 3 or 4 is a heavy vaginal discharge. This is usually noted right after conception, and even before a pregnancy test will issue a positive result. It may be whiter and milkier than usual.
At the end of week 4, you may notice cramping and spotting. If this is normally part of your cycle, it may go unnoticed. Spotting is actually called “implantation bleeding.”
Pay attention to sore breasts. They can grow quickly and become painful to the touch. Oversensitive nipples or darkened areolas are also often a feature of pregnancy at the end of the first month.

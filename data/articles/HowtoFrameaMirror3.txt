 You'll need a wooden frame that can fit around the mirror and ribbon that's slightly wider than that frame. Cut out a paper template of one side of the frame, including the mitered corners.
Paint the frame's inner and outer edges to a color that's similar to the ribbon's.
Cut the ribbon slightly longer than the paper template.
Iron on strips of fusing to the back of each piece of ribbon.
Use a pencil to trace the template onto the fusing. Cut the shape out of the ribbon. Repeat with three other pieces.
Press each ribbon piece, fusing side down, onto the frame. Place a towel over the ribbon and iron on a low setting to adhere.
 Repurpose an antique platter or plate by using its border as a decorative frame for a mirror. If the platter is broken, use ceramic epoxy to glue the pieces together.
Measure the perimeter of the platter's central well.
Draw the measured shape on a piece of paper; then cut out the shape to make a template.
Find a mirror that matches the template shape, or get a professional glass cutter to cut a mirror to the measurements of your template.
Create a braided trim by gluing pillow piping around the perimeter of the mirror.
Use ceramic epoxy to glue the mirror to the center of the platter. For a more temporary adhesive, use mounting tape.
Hang the platter mirror with a plate hanger.
 Use stencil patterns to decorate your mirror. Find a stencil pattern that you like on paper. Trace the pattern onto a piece adhesive shelf liner.
Cut the pattern out of the adhesive liner with a utility knife.
Peel the border of the liner back and adhere it onto the mirror.
Use a bristle brush to apply enamel paint over the stencil. Let the paint dry overnight, and then strip it off.
 Use a hot glue gun to attach a border of them around your mirror.

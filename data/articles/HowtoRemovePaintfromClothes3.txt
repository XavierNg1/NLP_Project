 If you are unsure about whether or not your clothing item is dry-clean only, check the care information and fabric content on its tag. Fabrics that are commonly dry-clean only include acetate, silk, wool, and velvet. Even if your clothing does not include these materials, if the care tag says "Dry Clean Only" follow the steps below to remove any latex or oil paint stains., It is best to treat paint stains when they are still wet, so be sure to remove as much paint as possible as soon as you notice the stain.









It is possible to damage sensitive fabrics by scrubbing too hard or using harsh brushes. For this reason it is best to remove excess paint using the dull side of a spoon or another similarly dull object.
 Using a sponge dampened with a dry cleaning solution like Afta, gently blot the stain. To keep the stain from spreading, begin blotting from the outside edge of the stain and work your way to the center.
 Dry spotters contain dry solvents that will absorb grease and oil stains, and they are particularly helpful when removing oil paint stains.









You can purchase dry spotter, or you can make it at home using coconut oil and liquid dry cleaning solvent., This will help pull the paint stain out of the clothing. Keep a cloth and dry blotter on the stain until it disappears.









To prevent the stain from running or bleeding, change the cloth often.
Keep the stain and the clean cloth damp with the dry spotter. They won't remove the paint when dry, and allowing the stain to dry will make it harder to remove later.
 Once the stain has been completely removed, rinse the area one more time with dry cleaning solvent. This will help remove the dry blotter and any remaining oil or grease. Then let your clothing dry normally.

 You don't necessarily have to give him an explanation or a reason why. You can just tell him that you're not interested, or you don't want to give him your number. If you use this method, make sure you really don't want to keep in touch with the guy, even if you see him again.For instance, you could say, "Thanks for asking, but I'm not interested."
You can also just give him a number to stay in touch as friends, as long as you are abundantly clear about it. For instance, you could say, "I don't mind giving you my number, but I would only do so as friends. I'm not interested in anything else right now.";
, If you want, you can take a direct, but not quite as direct approach. For instance, you can try to soften the blow by leading with something you like about the guy. That way, the rejection won't come as hard.As an example, you could say, "You're really attractive, but I don't think I'm in a place to be dating right now. I have to say no." This approach helps make it less about him, so he won't feel as hurt.
 When you're using the direct or indirect approach, "no" needs to be in what you say. If you hem and haw around it without actually using "no," you leave him thinking he may still have a chance with you. You don't need to be mean, just direct.For instance, saying "I'm not sure I want to date right now" leaves it a little uncertain.
Instead, make sure you make it clear. "I'm not interested in dating right now, so I have to say no."
Be polite but firm. Thank the guy for his interest. Say that you're flattered he is interested. However, let him know that you're not looking for a relationship at the moment, and hence, you're not able or willing to share your number.
 It's a natural reaction. You want to apologize for making the person feel bad. However, you don't need to apologize for not wanting to give out your number. In addition, it can draw attention to the fact that you feel sorry for him, which in turn can make him feel worse.

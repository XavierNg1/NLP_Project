 To square your height, multiply your height in inches by itself. For example, if you are 70 inches tall, then multiply 70 by 70. Your answer for this example would be 4,900., Next, you will need to divide your weight by your squared height. For example, if your weight in pounds is 180, then divide 180 by 4,900. You would get an answer of 0.03673., To get your BMI, you will then need to multiply your last answer by 703. For example, 0.03673 multiplied by 703 equals 25.82, so your approximate BMI in this example would be 25.8.

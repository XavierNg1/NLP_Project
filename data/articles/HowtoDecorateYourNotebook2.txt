 This type of glue and sealer is perfect for securing glitter to your notebook. To cover your notebook in glittered horizontal stripes, you'll need to brush on the Mod Podge for one stripe, cover it with your desired color, and then do the process again for another color. If you brush all of it on at once, the glitter won't stay within the confines of the stripes and will spill everywhere. Use a sponge brush to apply the Mod Podge.You can adjust the size of the stripe to the size of your notebook. You should have at least five stripes on the notebook, so you can make them a bit thicker or thinner so they cover the notebook evenly.
 Choose one color of glitter and sprinkle it on to the stripe. You can smooth down the glitter with your fingers, and shake off any excess glitter. For best results, wait a minute or two for this layer to dry.
 Once you've created the first glittery stripe, make another stripe of glue below it.
 Do exactly what you did with the first color of glitter, except use a new color that will nicely contrast with the first. For example, you can use blue and yellow, green and red, or silver and gold.
 Continue adding a stripe of Mod Podge followed by a stripe of glitter to the notebook until you've covered the notebook with colors of alternating glittery stripes.
 Once you've covered your notebook with the stripes, brush another layer of Mod Podge over the first stripe, cover it in glitter, and then repeat this process with each stripe until you've covered the whole notebook with a second layer of stripes. This will make the glitter stick to the notebook even more.
 To emphasize the contrasting stripes, use a thin brush to add a layer of white paint around the stripes. This will make the colors "pop" more and will complete your original glittery notebook. If you've chosen very light colors, like yellow and baby blue, you can think about using a Gray or darker color to emphasize them instead of white.

 If your health care provider has determined your peptic ulcer was caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), antibiotics are necessary to eradicate the bacteria. The H. pylori is a bacteria that weakens the stomach's protective coating enabling damage to the sensitive layers below. If you have H. pylori you will probably be prescribed what is known as "Triple Therapy." This involves you taking three kinds of medication for a certain period of time.


You will need to take two antibiotics, as well as a proton pump inhibitor. The inhibitor will work to reduce acid production.;
, Some NSAIDs can exacerbate your ulcer and cause pain and irritation. Common drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen can make the stomach more vulnerable to acid and pepsin. These drugs are frequently found in nonprescription medications that you might take to treat a headache or muscle pain. Keep this in mind, check the ingredients and speak with your doctor about whether or not you can take NSAIDs., Many antacids are available over the counter which can relieve irritation and pain of heartburn and indigestion. While they might ease discomfort, they will not treat or cure an ulcer. If you want to take antacids be sure to speak to your doctor about it first as they can block the absorption of your prescribed medication, and consequently lower it's effectiveness.


In general doctors suggest taking antacids at least an hour before, or two hours after, you take your prescribed medication.
Easily accessible antacids include magnesium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide, calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate.

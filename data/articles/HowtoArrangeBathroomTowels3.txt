 If you have the space, a rustic, antique surface makes a quaint decoration and a convenient surface to arrange your towels on. Neatly pile your towels atop the chair, arranging them from largest to smallest.
 Select either a low cabinet that sits on the ground or a high cabinet that must be nailed to the wall. By opting for a cabinet with a glass front, you can store your spare towels while simultaneously using them as decorations. Piles of crisp white towels can make your bathroom look cleaner and more refreshing, while piles of colorful towels can introduce contrast and vibrancy into the space.


You can also arrange the towels you presently need on top of the cabinet.
 A bookshelf is functional and introduces a bit of visual interest into the room, since you would not typically expect to see one in a bathroom. Plus, a bookshelf pays homage to the idea of having “reading material” in the bathroom; though, whether you choose to include such material is entirely up to you. Pile your largest towels on the bottom shelves and your hand towels and washcloths on the mid-range shelves for easy access.
 If you prefer to keep your towels out of sight, you can arrange them inside a more decorative surface, like a large, lidded wicker basket. You can also introduce a more functional piece into the room, like a window bench or vanity seat with built-in storage.

If you're trying to decide on a cat for a pet, consider a non-pedigreed. There are always plenty of them needing homes and unless you're dead set on a particular pedigree for a very good reason, give a home to an intelligent, often healthier, random bred. In general, random bred cats tend to have fewer genetic health problems.

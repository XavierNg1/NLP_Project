 For this project you will need 3 pieces of 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) ribbon, each 8 inches (20.3 cm) in length along with another 3 pieces of 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) ribbon, each 7.25 inches (18.4 cm) in length.


You will also need a hot glue gun and a rhinestone, button or pearl.
Using different colored ribbon for the longer and shorter pieces creates a pretty finished product.
 Lay all six pieces of ribbon out in front of you, with the shiny or patterned side facing down.









Take your first piece of ribbon and fold it in half to form a crease down the middle. Lay the ribbon out flat again.
Place a small dot of glue along the crease line, then the bottom end of the ribbon and make a sideways loop. Glue the end of the ribbon onto the crease line, making sure the shiny or patterned side is glued facing down.
Repeat with the top end of the ribbon, making the loop in the opposite direction to form a figure of eight.
Now do the same thing with the five remaining pieces of ribbon, until you have six figures-of-eight.
 Take the three slightly larger figures-of-eight (these are the ones you made with the longer lengths of ribbon) and place a dot of glue in the center of one of them.


Take the second figure-of-eight and and stick it to the first one horizontally, so they form an "X" or a cross shape. Take the third figure-of-eight and stick it on top of the other two, to form a flower.
Repeat this process with the three remaining figures-of-eight to form a second flower. Then place a dot of glue in the center of the larger flower and stick the smaller one on top.
 Place a dot of hot glue in the middle of the smaller flower and attach the rhinestone, pearl or button to form the center of the flower.

 In Rescue Mode, the pets are usually stuck at the top of the columns of blocks. On the pre-game screen, you will be told how many pets you need to rescue and how much points you need to meet in order to beat the level.;
, Match the same-colored blocks to clear the paths for the pets to come down to the ground. Take out the obstacles that may be present. Use the items and boosters available for you in the level.


The rocket booster can be very useful in this game mode, as it can clear a column of blocks easily in one swoop.
 Most likely, levels in Rescue Mode will require a minimum number of points, on top of saving the pets. Focus on getting huge points by combing out huge groups of same-colored blocks on every move.


Simply bringing the pets to the ground may not complete the level just yet.

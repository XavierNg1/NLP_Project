Colouration: Belted Galloway cattle have a white "belt" or "sheet" around their bellies (varying in size, but often extending from the shoulder to the hooks) just like Dutch Belted cattle do. They are mostly black, but they also come in dun (silver to brown) and red.

Body type and characteristics: Belted Galloway are the same size and body type as Galloways, plus they also have the same thick, shaggy coat that make them quite tough and hardy in cold climates. However most breeders claim that BG's are a little bit larger than Galloways are, with bulls averaging between 1800 and 2100 lbs, and cows from 900 to 1300 lbs.

Head characteristics: All BG's are polled. They also tend to have a bit of extra hair sprouting from their polls like Galloways do.

Other characteristics: BG's share the same ancestry and origin as Galloways do (originating from the southern lowlands of Scotland). However, according to "History of the Belted Galloway Society Inc." The Herd Book of the Belted Galloway Society, Inc. (1951-1971) by A. Mims Wilkinson Jr., most historians believe this breed originated from the infusion of Dutch Belties with Galloways sometime in the 17th or 18th century. Yet, there are documents dating back to the 16th century in Scotland that first mentioned these "sheeted" cattle.

BG's have the same qualities of Galloways, but breeders claim that this breed tends to milk heavier, are larger, and grow more rapidly than their parent breed.

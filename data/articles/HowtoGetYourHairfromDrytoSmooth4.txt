 Be sure to eat plenty of fresh produce along with an ample amount of water.. Nourish your hair both from your insides and outsides.
 Apple cider vinegar is another miracle food. Buy the vinegar with the active culture for better results. Combine Â½ a cup of apple cider vinegar with 1 cup of warm water. Spritz it into your hair after you wash it, and allow it to sit for ten minutes. Then, rinse again, but without shampoo.
 Another thing you can add after your showers is aloe vera for extra moistness. Simply massage aloe vera onto your hair and let settle for about 20 minutes. Rinse with cool water afterwards.

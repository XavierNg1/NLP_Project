 The subtle eyeliner and non-existent blush are the perfect addition to a beachy, preppy look. Gather other "natural" inspirations from artists like Emma Watson, Rachel Biel and Lauren Conrad.;
, Get pencil liner in a roasted-nut color, eyeshadow in a champagne color, blush in a dewy peach color and lip-color (lipstain, lipstick, lipgloss, etc.) in peachy, rosy, and caramel-y colors.
 Blend into dark or red areas slowly. Check in a lighted space.
 Gently stretch your lower lid down and pencil in a thin line, close to the lashes. Smudge slightly with a cotton bud.
 Stop just above the crease. If you prefer the dewy look, then get a hazelnut color and spread that into the crease and at the outer corner of your eyes.
 Dip a fluff-brush in the blush/powder and spread it to the tops of your cheeks, just in between your eyebrows and just under your chin. Yes, under your chin! Blend well with your ring finger so that it's not very noticeable; but still adds some color to your skin.
 Then take your lip-color of choice and hold it steady in your hand. Lipstick is best because it sticks to your lips but doesn't look fake, but gloss is good, too. As long as it's not shiny.


Take lip color in your hand. Place your elbow on a flat surface. Smooth the color over your bottom lip, filling it in carefully. Don't apply too heavily.






Light salmon colors, or light rose tints look very preppy and natural.
 For red hair, experiment with chestnut colors, or even grey tones!

 Chop the carrots into rounds, cut them into slices, or dice them into bite-size chunks.
 Salt the water and bring to the boil.
, You can add more water to the pan if necessary.


Be aware that carrots cooked in this way are not steamed in the true sense of the word, as the vegetables are cooked in water.
However this is a good alternative to steaming if you don't have a steamer basket or microwave, and produces a similar result.
, Toss the carrots to coat, then transfer to a serving dish and serve immediately.

 If done well, this part will leave your hat snug on your head. If you're unfamiliar with decreasing, stop now and do some research online.









Place stitch markers every 8 stitches.
When at 2 stitches before the marker, decrease (a fancy term for knitting two stitches together at once).
Continue this pattern, decreasing every round.
After decreasing for a bit, you'll notice your hat getting smaller and smaller. Don't be afraid to adjust your needles accordingly; this won't mess up your work.
 When you have just 4 stitches left on your needle, you're ready. Snip off more than enough to work with in finishing the hat, about 15-20 inches (38-50 cm).
 Take a darning needle or crochet hook and pull the loose yarn through your remaining 4 stitches one at a time. This will tighten the top of your hat.









After you've pulled the loose yarn through each stitch on the needle, slide the needle out.
 Grab the loose end and pull it down through the top of the hat with your crochet hook. The end should end up at the underside/inside of the hat.









Cut it down to about a few inches. Weave in the end using a darning needle down the length of your hat. This will remain secure and tight and hide the seam.
You can also hide the starting tail end by weaving it through the hat as well.
 Enjoy your knitted hat!

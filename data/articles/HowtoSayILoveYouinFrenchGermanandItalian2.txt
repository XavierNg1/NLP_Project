 Different variations of German may pronounce "Ich" ("I") different ways, and generally it's impossible to write correctly in English. It's in the IPA, a phoneme that doesn't exist in English.


However, English used to have this phoneme. Put your mouth in position to sound out the word "human." That very first sound--where air is coming out for the "h" but your mouth is ready to say the "u"--is the most similar to . Now put an "ih" in front to get the proper pronunciation of "Ich."

Many websites may write "ish" or "esh." This is close, but not perfect. Think of "sh," but put the middle of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, spread it out, and make the "sh" sound. It may sound funny at first.
 Now that you have "Ich," you can work on the whole phrase: Ich liebe dich.


"Liebe" is a bit easier. The second syllable, "buh" has a hint of an "r." Think of the sound in "burn." "Liebe" should sound somewhere between lee-buh and lee-bur.
"Dich" has the same sound as "Ich." Put a "d" in front of it and you're ready!

, Practice it over and over until you're making those 's and touching lightly on that invisible "r." Ich liebe dich, Ich liebe dich. Getting it?


Don't be tempted to use "du" instead of "dich." "Du" does mean you, yes, but that's for the nominative case. German uses cases (English used to) and here, "you" needs to be in the accusative case.

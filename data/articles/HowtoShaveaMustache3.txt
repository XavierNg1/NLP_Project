 Though a straight razor can cut through the hair regardless of length, it takes much more skill on behalf of the shaver if a full mustache is involved, so begin by trimming the mustache down significantly with a trimmer or a small pair of scissors.
 When using a straight razor, the natural oils of your skin can actually help lubricate the shave, so you may prefer not to wash your face until after shaving. To prep the skin simply wring out a towel after running warm water on in and place it over your mustache for a minute.
 Like with a safety razor, a small amount of a good pre-shave oil will help provide an extra layer of lubrication to protect again cuts and irritation.
 You do not want to use a canned gel with a straight razor. Apply shaving soap with a good brush and work it into a rich lather over your mustache.


Brushing against the grain of your mustache will help raise the hair and exfoliate your skin.
 You want to hold the straight razor at a 30-degree angle with your little finger on the tang—the little curved bit—and your other three fingers on the back of the shank with your thumb on the front of the shank beneath the blade.This will give you the most control and precision with the straight razor.


Do not apply pressure. Allow the weight of the blade to do the cutting and use your hand to guide it rather than to apply any pressure.
To form a taut surface flatten your lip downward. You can also use your free hand to tilt your nose up slightly, which will additionally tighten the skin on your upper lip.
Never under any circumstances use the blade in a sawing motion.
 As with other wet shave methods, the warm towel or shower to start opens your pores, and a splash of cold water when you’re done helps close them.
 Apply a small amount of the aftershave of your choice based on your skin type.

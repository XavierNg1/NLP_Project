 Motion-activated sprinklers can be programmed to spray water anytime an animal enters the garden. These sprinklers can deter not just dogs, but cats, deer, and other unwanted animal intruders.


Motion activated sprinklers range from $35 to over $100.
A popular choice is the “Orbit 62100 Yard Enforcer Motion Activated Sprinkler,” available on Amazon for $60.
 If your dog frequently walks on your garden on its way someplace else, you may be able to provide a better path for it! If you are open to reorganizing your garden, you can create a path right through the middle. Otherwise, create a path for your dog nearby.For a pleasant dog-friendly path, you may want to use:


Soil/sand mixture.
Outdoor carpet.
Step stones.
 You can encourage your dogs to stay away from the garden by providing a better space for them to play. If you like having the dogs with you in the yard, this is great way to keep them happy and enjoy their company.Choose a location. Dogs tend to prefer shade. Provide enough space for dogs to play and relax.
Select a dog-friendly surface. The top choice is a sand/soil mixture, but wood chips or leaves will work too.
Provide some toys and a dish with water.
Use positive reinforcement to encourage dogs to hang out in this space.
 If the dog in question belongs to you, you may be able to train it not to enter the garden. If your dog has never had any kind of training, you might consider formal obedience training for your pet.


Praise your dog when it does not enter the garden and provide a treat.
Scold your dog with a firm "No" when it enters the garden. Avoid yelling or physical threats.
Be consistent and try to remain patient throughout this process.

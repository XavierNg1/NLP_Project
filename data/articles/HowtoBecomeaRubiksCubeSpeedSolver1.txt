 A Rubik's brand is fine if you really played with it for a long time but you may prefer a cube built for speed, such as the actual speed cubes, Moyu, YJ, Dayan, Shengshou or Fangshi (Funs puzzle); these are all good, high-quality cubes. The advantage of a quality speed cube is that turning takes very little force and the cube turns even if the layers aren't perfectly aligned so that you don't need to be 100 percent accurate with each turn.


If you're using a Rubik's brand cube, or a cheap knock-off cube you picked up from a dollar store, it is recommended you upgrade to a cube that is easier to turn.
Modern speed cubes cost anywhere from $4-$15 (£3-£11).;
, Do not use Vaseline, as this harms the cube over use. Instead, use purpose-made cube lube, such as Z lube and Maru.


Some heavy lubes (Cubicle lube, Traxis, Lubix, etc.) will make your cube slower for a short period of time, but make it smooth after breaking in the cube; breaking in means wearing out the plastic and making the cube smoother and faster. .
 This means doing a lot of solves or turning one layer at a time for a period of time. However, a more efficient way to break in a cube is using a drill for hard work:


Take a big Lego sheet and build Lego bricks that will fit around one layer of the cube.
Connect the Lego bricks to the drill with screws.
Put your cube in and turn it on. Do take breaks with the drill though, otherwise you can burn the plastic.

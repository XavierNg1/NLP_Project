 Invasive Candidiasis occurs when excess Candida enters the bloodstream and causes an infection. Invasive Candidiasis is most likely to happen in hospital patients or residents of nursing homes. If you are in an intensive care unit or are using a catheter, you are at risk of invasive Candidiasis. Having a weakened immune system, low neutrophil, or diabetes can also put you at risk.


You may be at risk if you have taken broad-spectrum antibiotics, experienced kidney failure, or had surgery, especially gastrointestinal surgery., To prevent invasive Candidiasis, your doctor may prescribe an antifungal prophylaxis. If you have had an organ transplant or a stem cell transplant, you might be prescribed this. Ask about it as well if you are a high-risk ICU patient or a chemotherapy patient. If you have had an infant born at less than 2.2 pounds, ask about the rates of invasive Candidiasis at the hospital.


Your doctor may recommend that your infant be given an antifungal medication if the rates of infection are high., Medical equipment can carry traces of Candida. Workers in hospitals might carry traces of it on their hands. While staying in a hospital, make sure your hands are clean, and ask anyone who touches you to wash their hands first. If you are wearing a catheter, ask how long it should stay in, and speak up if it isn't changed on time. If the skin around the catheter becomes swollen, red, sensitive, or painful, tell a healthcare worker immediately.

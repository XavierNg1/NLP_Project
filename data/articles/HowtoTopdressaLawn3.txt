 Don’t worry if it’s not even at this point. Apply approximately 3 to 4 pounds (1.5 to 2 kilograms) of topdressing per square yard/meter. A good rule of thumb is to not have topdressing more than 1-inch thick in any spot.
 There should be no visible remaining top dress when you finish this step.
 Remember to leave the tips of the grass exposed to the air. If you put down too much topdress, remove it.
 The extra nutrients and fresh soil can help it germinate and take root quickly.

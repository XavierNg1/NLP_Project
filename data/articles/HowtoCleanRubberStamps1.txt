 Be aware that washing this way can loosen the adhesive of the rubber portion from a wooden block stamp. If that is a concern, use the wipes method instead; alternatively, only wipe, do not dip (and definitely do not soak) the rubber stamps.


Fill a bowl with warm, soap water. Use a mild soap.
Dip the stamp into the bowl to dampen the rubber portion. Alternatively, dip the cleaning implement in the soapy water, to spare the stamp holding portion from getting wet.
Use a cleaning cloth to wipe the ink off or scrub with an old toothbrush.
Repeat until the ink has come off.;
, Simply wipe the ink off using any suitable wipe, such as a baby wipe, a cleaning wipe or a travel wipe. The wipes are safest when they do not contain alcohol or aloe. To dry, press into a thick layer of paper towel.


This is a good method for using while stamping, in between color changes.
Wipes only work on water/archival based ink; not permanent ink.

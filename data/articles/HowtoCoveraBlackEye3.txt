 If you don't have access to any makeup, don't worry! It's still possible to hide your black eye. For instance, if you have long hair, try wearing your bangs low so that they cover the affected eye. This won't work for everyone — for instance, if you have a pixie cut, you're out of luck — but it's a great first step to keep an embarrassing black eye hidden.
 Sunglasses are another great choice for covering up a black eye. The great thing about sunglasses is that they allow you to make a conscious, positive decision about your outfit — you're not just trying to hide your black eye, you're also picking the pair of sunglasses that will make you look great. However, this strategy isn't without its downsides: keep in mind, for instance, that wearing shades indoors can raise suspicion.


For bad black eyes, larger, darker shades are best. For example, reflective aviators or Kurt Cobain-style vintage frames are great choices., If you can get away with wearing it, headgear offers another chance to hide your black eye. Wear your hat or hood low, but not so low you can't see where you're going — the last thing you want is another black eye.


Good choices for hats include standard baseball caps, flat-billed caps, straw hats, sun hats, beanies (stocking caps), and so on. In terms of hoods, basic "hoodie" sweatshirts work well.
 Just can't seem to get your eye looking like brand-new? Don't sweat it. There's usually nothing wrong with wearing your black eye as-is. An unhidden black eye can be a badge of pride: you're basically saying to the world, "I don't care enough to let other people's stupid ideas about beauty ruin my day." Generally, 99% of the people you meet will be curious about your black eye — not repulsed by it. Best of all, it's a conversation starter, and you'll (hopefully) have a funny story to tell everyone who comments on it!

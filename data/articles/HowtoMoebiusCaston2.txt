 When you have finished casting on and you are ready to begin working, take a moment to check the stitches for twisting. Straighten out any stitches that are twisted before you get started., Before you start knitting, you will need to slip the slipknot off of the needle. This will be your first stitch on the left hand side. Slide it off the needle and pull the tail to unravel it., After you remove the slipknot you can begin working your stitches in the round. Knit every single stitch that you have cast on.Keep in mind that the first round will be a bit difficult to work because the stitches will be very tight. Try to be patient as you get through this round.

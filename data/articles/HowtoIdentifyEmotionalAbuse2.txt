 Getting angry every once in a blue moon or so is normal, but screaming practically every day is not.The abuser may become hostile and aggressive.
They may scream and swear.
If the person has anger management issues, try to get help for them.
 Name-calling is the act of using offensive names to insult someone.Name-calling can be a form of emotional abuse if it is very negative and repeated often. Some examples of name-calling are:


“Hey, stupid. You idiot. You are a dummy.”
“You wimp.”
“You freak. Weirdo. You are so psycho.”
Note that if the individual welcomes the name as a joke of humorous, it may not constitute verbal abuse. For example, some girls may call each other names as friends and do not necessarily mean it as harm. However, these behaviors can still cause psychological harm if the individual is sensitive to the topic.
 Sometimes people who are abusive excuse or justify their behaviors by blaming the victim.The individual may begin to believe that they is deserving of the abuse or it is somehow their fault.


Blaming might look like, “This is all your fault. Admit it. I had no part in this. Apologize.” It can also be more subtle such as, “I wouldn’t mistreat you if you didn’t act so badly.”
Shaming can be things like, “Look at what you did. You are a bad person. You should be disgusted with yourself. I am so ashamed of you.”

This can involve inappropriately teasing or taunting someone. For example, teasing someone about his weight or appearance can be emotionally abusive.

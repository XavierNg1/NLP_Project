 There are many factors that can cause your gums to recede. Your dentist can help you identify any risk factors that you may have. Typical causes of receding gums include:Gum disease
Using a hard-bristled toothbrush or brushing too hard
Being born with naturally thin or weak gums
Smoking and using tobacco
Trauma to your gum tissue

, Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently brush your teeth twice a day. Your toothbrush should be at a 45 degree angle to your gums. Brush back and forth using short strokes with no pressure on the toothbrush.Then do a vertical move by simply "pulling" the gum toward your tooth surface with the brush. A good gum massage, along with a brushing technique that stimulates the gum growth towards the chewing surface, is the secret of preventing recession.


Be sure to brush all the different surfaces of your teeth.
Replace your toothbrush every three to four months or even earlier if bristles start spreading and losing their color.
Brush your tongue when you are finished to remove bacteria.
 Flossing daily helps remove plaque that cannot be removed by brushing alone. Take 18 inches of floss and wind it around your middle fingers. Make a “C” shape when rubbing the floss between your teeth and gum line. Be gentle and never snap the floss into your gums.You can use dental floss, a dental pick, or a pre-threaded flosser. Talk to your dentist about which tool is best for you.
 The frequency of your dentist visits depends on the health of your teeth and gums. Most adults will need to go at least once a year. Your dentist will focus on preventive care and your overall oral health., If your regular dentist feels that you need more intensive care, you should see a specialist. A specialist can perform specialized treatments and surgical procedures to increase gum growth. These treatments are expensive and invasive.


Possible treatments to fix your gums include scaling and root planning or a gum graft. Your dentist will decide what is best for you.

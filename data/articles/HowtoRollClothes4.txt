Smoothing out the creases and folds will protect your garment from set in wrinkles., Fold the left and right sides of the garment bag in towards the center. Fold up the excess plastic at the bottom of the bag. Starting at the hem, loosely roll the item up towards the hanger.









As you fold and roll the item, smooth out any wrinkles or creases that appear.

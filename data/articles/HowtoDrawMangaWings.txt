 For this demonstration, a straight-on head shot is being used. You can draw your character any way you want, but remember, most wings attach to the back, so if you're drawing a profile or back view you'll have to draw that, too. Also, you must decide if you're putting the hair in front or behind the wings. In this demonstration, the hair is in front, but again, it can be any way you choose. Also, you can draw your character full body, or just to the torso. Head shots are not recommended for wings pictures because wings generally attach to the body below the head, but again, it's your artwork, your choice.;
, Notice that you're just drawing the top, not the extensions. This basically looks like an upside-down "V" on each side, or a giant "M" together. If you want your wings to go up, again, draw the basic line in which you'd like them to follow.
 Your skeleton is your guide. Towards the vertex of the "V," draw lots of little triangles, your first feathers, then follow the "V" line back to the shoulders. If you're not using the "V" skeleton, make your first layer end about where the joint would be.
 Draw lots of triangles coming down from your first layer. Keep in mind the lengths; this will determine the overall shape of the wing. Usually, the wing will become smaller as it approaches the shoulder, or wherever else it connects to the body. The main shape of the feather should be roughly triangular, but not perfect straight lines, and wider towards the base. Especially if you are doing an unorthodox wing shape (smaller character), don't be afraid to have spaces between your feathers. If your character has shadows, retrace the wing on the shadowed side to make it seem darker. You can add third, or even fourth layers to make your wings longer and more realistic looking.
 Add color if you want. Congratulations, you're done!

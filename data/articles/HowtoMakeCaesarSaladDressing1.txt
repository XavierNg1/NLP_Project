 Using a sharp knife, chop up the anchovy fillets and garlic cloves. Mash the two together with the flat side of the blade, then sprinkle the mixture with salt.A small can of anchovy fillets should contain all you need. Get the anchovies packed in oil, then drain well before using them for this dressing.
If you don't wish to use anchovy fillets, you could 2 tsp (10 ml) of prepared anchovy paste instead.;
, Place the mashed anchovy mixture in a medium bowl. Add the egg yolk, lemon juice, and mustard, whisking well to combine.


Only use egg yolks from pasteurized eggs. There's no heat involved in this recipe, so the yolks won't be cooked.
 Pour a thin stream of olive oil into the mixture, whisking simultaneously. Continue whisking until the dressing becomes thick and glossy.


The ingredients should be fully emulsified, forming a consistently thick dressing.If you are unable to pour and whisk simultaneously, add the oil 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time and whisk well after each addition. Adding the oil too quickly can make it difficult to blend into the rest of the ingredients.
 Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese and ground black pepper into the dressing. Whisk to combine.


If desired, you could also add more salt and lemon juice during this step. Perform a taste test and adjust the seasonings as needed.
 Drizzle the room temperature dressing over a prepared Caesar salad. Alternatively, chill it in your refrigerator for several hours and serve the dressing cold.


You can prepare this dressing 24 hours in advance, but it's best to save and use homemade Caesar dressing within one or two days. Keep it in an airtight container in your refrigerator and whisk slightly before serving.

 Duplicating armors can only be done once you’ve finished either the city of Solitude or Riften storyline, where you’ll be awarded with your very own house. Travel to your house in any of these two cities to begin.;
, Inside your Solitude or Riften house you’ll find a wooden mannequin where you can put and store your armors. Approach the mannequin and press the corresponding “Activate” button on your controller as prompted on the game screen to open your item inventory and start putting items on the figure.


Mannequins can be found nowhere else in Skyrim except inside the Solitude and Riften house.
 Scroll along your item inventory and find the armors you want to duplicate. Press the corresponding “Give” button on your controller as prompted on the game screen to store the item on the mannequin.


You can duplicate several pieces of armor, but only of one type at a time. For example, you can duplicate boots, chest plates, gauntlets, or helmets in one go, but you cannot duplicate two helmets, chest plates, or two pairs of boots at the same time.
 Without closing the item inventory, scroll along the lists of item on the mannequin and press the corresponding “Take” button on your controller as prompted on the game screen to take back the items you’ve put on the mannequin.
 Press the corresponding “Exit” button on your controller as prompted on the game screen to close the item inventory and leave the house through one of the exits.
 After stepping outside, head back inside the house and go back to where the mannequin is. You’ll notice that the mannequin is wearing the items you’ve given and taken away a few moments ago.
 Press the corresponding “Activate” button on your controller as prompted on the game screen to open your item inventory and interact with the mannequin once more. Scroll along the item list on the figure and press the “Take” button to retrieve all the items on the mannequin. You now have two of each piece of armor on your inventory.

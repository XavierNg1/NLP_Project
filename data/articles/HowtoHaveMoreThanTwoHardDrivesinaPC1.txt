 External drives come in many shapes and sizes to fit any userâ€™s needs. Make sure your computer has a spare port to plug into.


Just want to plug and play? Look for a model without an external power supply.
Frequently backing up your data? Some models come with automatic backup software.
Pay attention to USB speeds! Newer versions of USB will transfer data faster, but your computer must have a corresponding port. Luckily both port and cables are backwards compatible!;
, External hard drives are usually connected via USB port, although some models may use external SATA. Once connected, the driver should install automatically and you can start using it to store data!

, Open the file explorer to verify that your drive is listed with your other storage devices. You should be able to start storing data immediately!

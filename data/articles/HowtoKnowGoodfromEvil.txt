 "Think of a country where people were admired for running away in battle, or where a man felt proud of double-crossing all the people who had been kindest to him. You might as well imagine a country in where two and two made five." --C.S. Lewis;
, There are subjectivists, who believe that each person can determine "good" and "evil" for himself. There are objectivists, who believe in a universal concept of Good and Evil. Good and Evil can be discussed independent of religion, so both the religious and the atheistic can be found in both viewpoints. Which do you identify with? Why?

, Uncounted philosophers and religionists have taught and debated Good and Evil, Right and Wrong, and other topics. Read up on the topic, see what others have said, and decide whether you agree or disagree.
 In general "evil" people do "wrong" things and "good" people do "right" things. Christianity, for example, puts emphasis on treating others the way you would have them treat you. But remember that each culture, to an extent, holds different opinions on what is right and wrong.
 Then, when you're satisfied with your list, define how many wrong actions it takes, or the severity of the action, to be declared "evil".
 Discussing with others may change what you believe to be right and wrong.
 Think about if wrong things can really be wrong if everyone does them.

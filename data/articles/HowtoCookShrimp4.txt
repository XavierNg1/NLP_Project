 Light a coal or gas grill to medium high heat.
 Remove the shrimp from the refrigerator and rinse them in cool water. Shake the excess water from the shrimp.
 Pierce the skewers through both the tail and the thickest part of the shrimp toward the head.


Metal or wooden skewers are both fine to use. If you use wooden skewers, soak them in water for 10 minutes before threading the shrimp onto them. This will prevent the skewers from burning.
Consider threading the skewers with onion slices, green and red pepper slices, and other vegetables with the shrimp.
 Lightly cover the shrimp with olive oil on both sides. Season it with salt and pepper to taste.
 Cook them on one side for 3 - 4 minutes. Turn them and cook on the other side for another 3-4 minutes. The shrimp are done when they're bright pink and the flesh is opaque.
 Take the shrimp off the skewers and serve hot.

 It may be your first instinct, but don’t squeeze around the edges of the wound with your fingers in efforts to push the splinter out. It rarely works and you risk breaking the splinter and causing more damage., If your splinter is made of wood, don’t get it wet. It might disintegrate when you pull on it, leaving smaller pieces deep in your skin., Avoid infecting the small wound. Just like you should sterilize any instrument you use, wash your hands with soap and water before touching your wounded area. Lather your hands well for at least 30 seconds with antibacterial soap, and rinse them thoroughly., Make sure not to break the splinter off or leave any material within your skin, as you'll increase the risk of an infection.Make sure to pull the splinter out at the same angle it went in to reduce the risk of it breaking. Splinters rarely enter the skin at a 90° angle.
 An infection can develop from any type of splinter, in any area, and at any depth, so be watchful for a couple of days after your splinter is removed. Common signs of an infection include swelling, redness, tenderness, pus, and numbness and tingling around the wound.More serious signs that the infection is spreading around your body include fever, nausea, night sweats, body aches, headaches and delirium. Seek medical help right away.

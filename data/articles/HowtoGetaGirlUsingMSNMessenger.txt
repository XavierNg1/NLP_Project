 Because if this is successful and she wants to meet you - she will obviously realize you lied to her (one of the worst things to do to a girl). Tell her the truth, and be friendly, adding "smiley" emoticons where possible. (This will make her think of that smiley face when she thinks of you).;
, This again, will help her to associate you with happiness. When she says she's feeling low, tell her you are there to talk to. And if she does open up (good sign) don't begin talking about yourself in the middle of her talk, just try to give her good advice.
 Then talk to her about it.
 When you're ready, and you have been talking to her for a while, ask for her phone number. If she gives it to you, good sign. If not, go back and talk to her for a while longer.
 If you get her phone number, text her as well as talk on MSN. This will help her to get to know you, something girls need - is trust.
 Ask if she wants to meet up sometime. Good luck.

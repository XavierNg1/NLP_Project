 Fishnets are the quintessential sexy tights—as if you need anything to help you look sexy. They are the perfect choice for a bold look on a night out. Wear classic fishnets, oversized fishnets with large holes, or nude fishnets for a retro look. Any type of fishnets are the right fishnets if they make you feel confident. Pair fishnets with a black miniskirt and stilettos, or ballerina flats if high heels aren’t your thing.Wear a pencil skirt with fishnets and platform heels for a look that says “sexy, but also very smart.”

, Suspenders aren’t just for the stereotypical “nerd” look, especially when worn on the legs. You can have the look of wearing suspenders with knee-highs without actually having to deal with the suspenders. This option is probably a lot cheaper as well, so it’s a win-win situation. Look for a pair of sheer tights with an opaque stripe down the middle, forming the appearance of suspenders. This is a great choice for an elegant and sexy look.Wear these tights with a skirt short enough to show off the suspender effect and make your partner (or crush) go crazy.
 Patterned tights aren’t only fun or edgy, they can also be great for a night out. A simple pattern can act as the interesting part of your outfit if you’re too tired or lazy to accessorize after a long day. The pattern could be small hearts, or a simple floral pattern on one part of the tights. If you’re feeling edgy, go for tights with small skulls.Pair the tights with a solid-colored skirt of any color. Black is probably the easiest color to match a pattern with though.

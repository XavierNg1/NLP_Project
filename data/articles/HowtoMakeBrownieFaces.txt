 Get a tray, and 5 packs of Entenmann's Brownie Bites. Open all the packages and put the brownie bites on the tray. Put the candy to the left of the tray, and the frosting and icing to the right. Put all the candy on the top side of the tray.;
, Coat it with icing. Put one toothpick in each of the frosting flavors. To make eyes, take the M&Ms or Skittles and place them on the face as eyes. You can use a frosting color to make eyeglasses. Just dip a toothpick in the frosting, and drag the toothpick around the eyes to make glasses. If there is no more frosting on your toothpick then you can dip it in to make more.
 If you are making girl hair, then cut 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) of licorice, and hang one end from the head. To make boy hair, lay licorice on top of the face to make boy hair. To make a mohawk, just take the hair and place the ends on the face and partially on on the back of the face. Make sure the strips you cut on the mohawk are only 1 half inch long! Also, make it stick out just like the way you laid it flat on the face for spiky hair! For a ponytail, make loose hair then twist it all together. You can do the same for 2 ponytails, and add a whole lot of licorice to make braids!

, Make a nose and mouth, but you can just use an M&M for a nose and a licorice for a mouth. Now decorate your brownie face with all sorts of things. Repeat steps 2-4 until you used up all your Brownie Bites.

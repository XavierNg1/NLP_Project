 Use a sharp knife and cutting board to remove a section of at least an inch from each end of the stalk. This will remove the dried-out portions from older cuts.


You may need to score the tough outer edge of the stalk by cutting or gently sawing a few millimeters in all the way around the stalk, then breaking it along the scoring, rather than trying to chop all the way through.You may need to cut more from each end if the ends have become very hard and dried and you cannot access the juicier flesh.
 Divide a long stalk into several smaller pieces that are easier to work with. Score and break or chop through the stalk to make pieces of about six inches.


It will be easiest to cut through sections of the stalk in between the thicker joints. Keep in mind, however, that the sections between the joints will also be the easiest to chew or use for other purposes, so it’s best to keep them intact.
You can also cut the stalk lengthwise into two, four, or more thinner sticks for consumption. Do this before cutting off the outer layer, or afterwards if it’s easier to do so.
 Stand a piece of the cane on its end and cut downward to remove the outermost layer of the stalk. This eliminates the hard, green “bark” that cannot be chewed.


Cut in about a millimeter from the edge, or wherever you see that the tougher green bark is distinguished from the inner white flesh.
You may be able to peel the outer layer down and off the stalk with your fingers after making an initial cut, depending on how easily your cane’s bark separates from the flesh.

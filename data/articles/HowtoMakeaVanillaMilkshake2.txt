 If you are using coconut milk, make sure that you use the kind that comes in a carton and not the canned kind. The canned kind is too thick and rich for milkshakes., Blend on a low speed for 10 seconds first, then on medium to medium-low speed for another 10 seconds. Finish off blending for 40 seconds on a medium to medium-high speed. This creates a smooth base for your milkshake., For a richer, more flavorful milkshake, omit the ice and use 1 cup (240 milliliters) of frozen coconut milk or almond milk instead. Freeze the milk in an ice cube tray the night before.If you can't find agave nectar, you can use maple syrup or stevia instead.
If you can find it, try 1 cup (144 grams) of vegan vanilla ice cream instead of ice.
You can also add 1 peeled and sliced banana alongside the ice to help thicken your milkshake.For an extra thick shake, use frozen coconut cream instead of coconut milk.It will be the most similar to ice cream.
 Make sure that there are no chunks of ice. From time to time, you may have to pause the blender, and scrape down the sides using a spatula. This will help everything blend more smoothly., You can serve it as is, or garnish it with a sprinkle of crushed cashew nuts. Enjoy it while it is still cold!

 The 1.21b patch, available through Blizzard’s Battle.net service, will allow you to play Warcraft 3 without inserting the CD as long as it has been legally installed and the CD key is registered with Battle.net.


Later patches work as well. For example, the latest patch for Warcraft 3 is 1.26a and it contains the same No-CD functionality.;
, You can get the latest patch directly from Blizzard’s website, or you can connect to Battle.net and download it automatically. If you connect to Battle.net from within the game, the patch will be downloaded and installed without any input from your required.


You will need a Battle.net account in order to patch Warcraft 3 officially through Blizzard. The account is what prevents piracy since the CD is no longer required.






If you would like to play online without using the Battle.net service, you can connect to others with third-party programs







, Once you have patched to the latest official version of Warcraft 3, you can play without needing to have the CD in the drive.

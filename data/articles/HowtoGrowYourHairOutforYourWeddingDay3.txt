 Washing your hair every day can ultimately cause damage by stripping your hair of natural oil and making it drier, which can leave to breakage. Instead of washing your hair every day with shampoo, try washing your hair two to three times a week instead.If you are worried about your hair getting oily, use a natural bristle brush to brush from your roots to your tips to redistribute your hair’s natural oil away from your roots and down through your hair shaft.
 Many popular drugstore shampoos contain silicone, which coats your hair and blocks the nutrients that encourage your hair to grow. Check the ingredients on your shampoo label and replace it if need be with a silicone-free shampoo., There are several hair growing shampoos on the market that are formulated without silicone and with nutrients like niacin and biotin needed to promote hair growth. Use one of these shampoos in the place of your normal shampoo as the label directs., Massaging your scalp increases blood flow, which in turn stimulates growth. When you are applying your shampoo or conditioner, use your fingers to massage the product gently into your scalp, making sure to massage all over, even around your ears., Unlike shampooing, conditioning your hair every day or at least several times a week is great for your hair and keeps it strong and healthy. Even if you skip washing your hair in the shower or bath, try to condition your hair, focusing on the ends of your hair where split ends and breakage tends to happen., Deep conditioners help your hair to grow stronger and prevent breakage. Buy a deep conditioner and use it as the label advises on your hair, or do a deep conditioning treatment at a salon.If you don’t want to spend money on additional products or treatments, you can also simply apply your regular conditioner to the ends of your hair before bed and braid your hair, then wash it off in the morning.
Make sure to regularly deep condition in the weeks leading up to your wedding for healthy and photographic hair.

 Set up a ladder in the backyard and write 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 on sheets of paper. Tape one piece to each step of the ladder. Have kids toss bean bags between the steps of the ladder. Keep track of the points they score as they play.Have bonuses for getting a bean bag to land on one of the steps.
This works great for one kid, who can try to beat their own score each time, or let multiple kids play to see who gets the highest score.
Make more or less point cards depending on how many steps the ladder has.
 Make a tic-tac-toe grid on the ground with chalk, tape, or pieces of rope. With two different colors of bean bags, allow players to toss their bags into spaces on the grid. Each player tries to get three in a row to win the game.Make a line a few feet from the grid that players have to stand behind to add a challenge to the game.
 Get a bucket and set it on the ground. Have the child stand five to ten feet from the bucket and attempt to throw the bean bag into the bucket. Use three or four bean bags to see how many they can make in the bucket. Let multiple children takes turn and see who gets the most bags in the bucket.This game allows for many variations such as using their non-dominant hand, closing one eye, throwing it over their head at the bucket behind them, or simply standing at farther distances.
If you donâ€™t have a bucket, use a box or any other container that some bean bags will fit in.
 Take a set of flashcards with colors, numbers, or other vocabulary words and lay them out on the ground. Have kids throw a bean bag and try to land it on one of the cards. If the bag lands on a card, have them pick it up and read the word on it.This is a fun way to practice reading skills and also get them active.
This game can be modified by changing the cards to fit any type of learning you need. Make flashcards with math problems on them or pictures to work on recognition.

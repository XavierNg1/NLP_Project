 One good way is to line a counter with several layers of newspaper and work over an old ice cream container placed on this paper surface.


See Warnings below for ventilation and proper disposal.
 Tip into a lidded container ready for proper disposal.


This step may not be applicable, if so, simply skip to the next step.
 Swish it about and dispose of the remains in a lidded container that you can dispose of properly. Don't wash it down the drain, as these contents may harm the environment.


If you find there are dried-on blobs of polish that stubbornly resist removal, add nail polish thinner to cover, then soak for about five minutes. Then use a toothpick to pick off the stuck-on polish.
 Add the lid on tightly. Shake this around for about a minute, to lift off any remains and pick up the last of the nail polish. This will also clean the brush. Tip into the container, then dispose of the container properly.
 Then rinse out with soapy water.
 Once dried, it's ready for repurposing.
 Allow to fully dry before reusing.


Only use non-toxic cleaners on the brush if the brush is to be reused on your body, although even if it's just for craft use, non-toxic is a good idea.
If you don't need the brush but you do need the lid, such as for one of the storage options, simply snap the brush off at the highest point possible and dispose of it.

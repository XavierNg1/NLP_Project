 The formula is P=a+b+c{\displaystyle P=a+b+c}, where the variables equal the three sides of the triangle. This formula is the same whether or not the triangle is right. You must have all side lengths to use this formula. If you know that you have an equilateral triangle, you only need one side length, since an equilateral triangle has three equal sides.For example, if a triangle has sides that are 5, 7, and 12 cm in length, you simply add up all the side lengths to find the perimeter: P=5+7+12=24{\displaystyle P=5+7+12=24}. So, the perimeter of the triangle is 24 cm.
 Sometimes you might be presented with a right triangle that only has two side lengths given. In this case, set up the Pythagorean formula to find the missing side length. The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the other two side lengths. Solve for the missing variable, and this will give you your missing side length.For example, if you have a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 10 cm, and one side length of 6 cm, set up the Pythagorean formula like this: 62+b2=102{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=10^{2}}

Solve for b{\displaystyle b}:36+b2=100{\displaystyle 36+b^{2}=100}36+b2−36=100−36{\displaystyle 36+b^{2}-36=100-36}b2=64{\displaystyle b^{2}=64}b2=64{\displaystyle {\sqrt {b^{2}}}={\sqrt {64}}}b=8{\displaystyle b=8}

Now that you have all three side lengths, you can add them up to find the perimeter: 10+6+8=24{\displaystyle 10+6+8=24}. So, the perimeter of the triangle is 24 cm.
 Since the height, or altitude, of an isosceles triangle bisects the base, if you know the height and base of the triangle, you can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side lengths.For example, if an isosceles triangle has a height of 10 cm and a base of 6 cm, you can think of the height creating two right triangles. Since the height bisects the base, one side length of the right triangle will be 3 cm. The other side length will be equal to the height: 10 cm. The missing side length is the hypotenuse.

Set up the Pythagorean formula, plugging in the side lengths: 102+32=c2{\displaystyle 10^{2}+3^{2}=c^{2}}.

Make the necessary calculations to find the missing side length:100+9=c2{\displaystyle 100+9=c^{2}}109=c2{\displaystyle 109=c^{2}}109=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {109}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}10.44=c{\displaystyle 10.44=c}.

Remember that an isosceles triangle has two equal sides. So, the perimeter of the triangle is equal to 2x+b{\displaystyle 2x+b}, where x{\displaystyle x} equals the length of one side, and b{\displaystyle b} equals the base. So, if you know the length of the base and one side, you can find the perimeter of an isosceles triangle: P=2(10.44)+6=26.88{\displaystyle P=2(10.44)+6=26.88}. So, the perimeter of the triangle is 26.88 cm.

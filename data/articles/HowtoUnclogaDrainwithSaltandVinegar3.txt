 Although the acidity from vinegar helps to eat through grease and other clogs, salt alone will scour the inside of the pipe, since it is so coarse and abrasive. Measure a 1/2 cup of salt. Then pour it directly down the drain., Boil 2 liters of water first. Pour this slowly down the drain. Aim the water directly into the drain to avoid scalding yourself with any splash-back. Once the boiled water has gone, run hot water from the tap to further flush the drain., Since you are only using salt, you will probably need to do this a few times to remove the clog. Continue to add salt in 1/2-cup increments, flushing with boiling water each time, before adding more.Avoid dumping too much in at one time.

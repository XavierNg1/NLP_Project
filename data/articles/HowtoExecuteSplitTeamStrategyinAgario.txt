 You should have enough mass to be able to influence other players, and not seem like a nuisance. Around 400-500 mass should be enough to entice others to join up with you.
 You should approach people who are either 100 mass smaller or larger than you. This will make them not see you as a threat, and vice versa., You should then divert your course to not seem like a threat. They will then attempt to pick up that ejected mass.

If they shoot some mass back at you, then you know that they probably want to team up with you.
 Basically, when you are in more than one piece, you should give all but one of those pieces to your friend. That way, nobody can attack you with the space bar when you are in several smaller pieces. They should then give back some mass, so that you can easily attack other players., Give them enough mass that they can be on the offensive., They might stab you in the back when you are most vulnerable. And you should also never stab a teammate in the back.

 Eating healthy snacks throughout the day keeps your blood sugar level and your mind clear. Opt for unprocessed snacks like fruits, vegetables, and nuts throughout the day, even when you don’t have a long day of computer use on your agenda.
 While a cup of coffee may give you an initial burst of energy, too much can cause a major caffeine crash. Stick to no more than 1-2 cups of coffee per day, and try not to ingest any caffeine after 3 pm., If you know you have a long day of computer work ahead, start your day with an energizing meal. Skip the breads and sugary cereals, and opt for a protein-enhanced smoothie, overnight oats, or a homemade breakfast burrito.
 If you use the computer for both work and play, try to find areas where tasks can be completed without the aid of a computer. Less time at a computer means less computer fatigue. Some examples:


Write ideas, lists, reports, poems, etc on paper instead of relying solely on a computer.
If you’re a computer gamer, try off-screen games like live action role-playing, Soitaire, or Magic: The Gathering.
Use a phone to make calls instead of video chat.
Watch a DVD on the TV instead of on your laptop. Because you’ll be sitting further back from the screen, it’s better for your eyes.
 If your muscles are sore after a long day of computer use, run a warm bath. You add epsom salt, sea salt, herbs, and essential oils to relax your central nervous system.

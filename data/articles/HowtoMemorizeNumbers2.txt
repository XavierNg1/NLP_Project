 Like in the major system, you assign each number a letter, although the associations are arbitrary. After converting the numbers to letters, you associate those letters with people and actions in the form of a story., Choose common letters that will be easy to make associations with. Consider using the following examples:A
B
C
D
E
S
G
H
N
O

, Mentally breaking up the sequencing of a longer number into several pairs of numbers will help you remember it more easily. For example: 827645 = HB GS DE

, Try to think of someone you know with those initials. Connecting your memory of the person to the image of the number will make it stick in your mind more firmly., Again, this is a way to increase the ease with which youâ€™ll be able to remember the numbers. Association is key here. Link the number pair to some action that will be easier to remember than just a random list of numbers.When assigning meanings to each pair of numbers, alternate between people and actions.

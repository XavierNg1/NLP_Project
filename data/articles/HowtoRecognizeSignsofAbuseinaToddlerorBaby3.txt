 Infants and toddlers are busy exploring their world, and itâ€™s completely normal for them to get a scratch or bruise in the process. However, if a child has numerous or severe injuries, or wounds that do not look like normal bumps and scratches, these can be a sign of abuse.You may see things like marks, bites, scratches, or burns that appear to have been made with an object.
You may also see injuries that are unusual for infants or toddlers, like black eyes.
You may see fading bruises or wounds after an absence from daycare or preschool.
If you ask the parent or caregiver about infant's or toddler's injuries, they may offer an excuse that seems fake or unlikely, such as "Tim got that burn because he built a campfire in the backyard."
Keep in mind that physical discipline (mild spanking, for instance) is not necessarily abuse., Infants and toddlers who are abused may also be neglected. For example, their clothes might not be clean or fit properly, or the child may be consistently dirty and unkempt., A child that has been sexually abused may experience some physical trauma as a result. Infants and toddlers may be unable or unwilling to tell you if they have suffered this abuse. However, you may see other signs, like trouble walking or sitting., For instance, you can take your child to a therapist to investigate the cause of any problem signs or behavior. If you are concerned about a child who is not your own, go to an authority (such as a school or daycare official, child protection services in your area, or the police). Tell them why you are worried about the child, and ask them to investigate.

Make sure to show the authorities any evidence of the abuse you may have, such as pictures of injuries, attendance records, or statements from the child.

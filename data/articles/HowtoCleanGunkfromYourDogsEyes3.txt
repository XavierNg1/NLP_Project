 While it might seem like a whole lot of fun, allowing your dog to ride along with her head hanging out the window can be a recipe for disaster. The resulting wind can blow debris in your dog’s eyes, which can in turn cause irritation or even an infection., The fur surrounding your dog’s eyes can be a hotbed for bacteria and viruses, which can quickly turn into an infection. Make sure you bathe your dog regularly and clean her eyes using either a damp cloth or a sterile pet eye wash.
 Keeping the hair around your dog’s eyes clipped can help prevent irritation and the proliferation of disease-causing bacteria and viruses. Have someone familiar with the dog hold her while you use blunt nosed scissors to trim the hair. If your dog is not comfortable with this, do not try it at home. Instead take her to your veterinarian for eye grooming.

 Preheat the waffle iron to the instructed directions on your waffle iron's package. Spread melted butter over the waffle iron with a pastry brush.
 In a large bowl mix the all-purpose flour, baking powder, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, salt, and brown. Mix with a wooden spoon until well-combined., In a separate medium-sized bowl whisk the milk, pumpkin puree, eggs, and butter until fully combined and the egg yolks break. The mixture should be liquid-like and should resemble an orange color., Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Beat with a whisk until folded in well. Do not over-mix. It's okay to have a few lumps in the waffle batter., Using a ladle, scoop the waffle batter and pour it on the waffle iron. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, until the waffles fully cook and the edges are slightly brown. Once cooked, remove the waffles from the waffle iron and place them on serving dish. Repeat until there is no more batter., Sprinkle icing sugar and maple syrup over the pumpkin waffles. Serve with a glass of milk or your favorite milkshake. Enjoy!

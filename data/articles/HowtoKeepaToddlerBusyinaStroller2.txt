 A good way to keep your toddler busy is to give them healthy snacks that they can eat in the stroller. Snacks that are broken into pieces, such as nuts, pieces of fruit, or healthy chips are all good options. This will help to keep their hands occupied and focus on eating in the stroller.You can also make the most out of the snacks by giving your toddler the snack a few pieces at a time. This way, you can prolong their time in the stroller and keep them occupied during a long walk or run.
 Snacks that take a while to finish, like popsicles or lollipops, can also be a good option for occupying your toddler in the stroller. Give them healthy fruit popsicles or natural sugar lollipops. This will keep them busy while you push the stroller around.Other snacks they can suck on for a while, like suckers or candies, can also be a good snack option for the stroller.
 Make sure your toddler has access to toys that they like in their stroller. You may have certain toys that are stroller only and bust them out before a walk in the stroller. Or your toddler may have a favorite toy they like to have with them in the stroller.Go for toys that can be attached to the stroller in some way, such as by a strap or a clip. Some toys also have clips you can attach to your toddler’s clothing to make sure they do not fall out of the stroller.
 Electronics like an iPad or an interactive game console can be a good option for keeping your toddler busy. You may not be a big fan of giving your child access to electronics regularly. But if they tend to get fussy in the stroller, this may be one way to get them to calm down and stay busy.You may limit your child’s access to electronics to only when they are in the stroller. This way, they will have more of an incentive to spend time in the stroller.

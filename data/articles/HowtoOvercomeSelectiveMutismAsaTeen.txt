, If you are super shy and don’t use expressions, just smile once in a while. If that's not it, then wave.
 It sounds dumb but hum what you’re trying to say. Not many people will understand but your closer friends will cope.
 Write a note and give it to the teacher. Or have a friend read it.
 If you are in school, you can ask your teachers in a note, to sit by your friends so you feel comfortable.
, Try whispering things. Not particularly to anyone but in public, whisper under your breath and start getting louder until you are comfortable. Maybe in school until you aren’t scared to whisper under your breath, maybe you can start whispering to a friend.
 Always know you can do it be confident

,, You know you can do it. You want to go to a new school where nobody knows you and talk. Well when your signing up try talking regular voice to your parent or whoever and be social and friendly to teachers. Be convinced you can do it.

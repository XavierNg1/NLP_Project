 It has to be unique, bold, and all your own! Think Taylor Swift's sweet, country girl style with those curly blond locks. Or Justin Bieber's famous hair flip. Or Lady Gaga's wild, totally unique fashion style. When it comes to your own, play to your strengths! Do you have curly hair? Set it free! Blond hair? Go platinum! Don't be afraid to be bold and creative.;
, Put your heart and soul into it; if it's cheerleading, find a way to make yourself captain. If it's singing, join the choir/glee club and rock the stage! Whatever it is, own it!

, What's the point in being the center of attention if it's for all the rumors you spread? When you meet someone, smile and try to act interested in what the other person has to say. Make friends with everyone, not just the popular people.
 Don't post sloppy messages with tons of slang and horrible grammar. Not saying you have to be the grammar police, but make sure your posts and comments are readable, and look at least somewhat professional. Don't overload on the emoticons, and don't be one of those people who posts what their doing every five minutes. Two or three posts a week should do it, but make sure you actually have something to say, not just "I'm bored".
 A celebrity is constantly in the spotlight! Even though it may be hard sometimes, maintaining a cool head and pleasant disposition will increase people's respect of you. Try to give good advice. (Just don't become an Agony Aunt.)

, Though it may seem cool on people like Ke$ha, that sort of thing can ruin your whole life. Plus, if you really want to make it big someday, it's going to be kind of hard from inside a jail cell!

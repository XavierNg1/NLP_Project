 Wait.
 Find others who are jumping towards the gate where you are at. You will know because if you point right at a station or other gate with minimum spread on the D scan, their ship will stay in view but the range will decrease rapidly.
 Right after the shiny ship has started to jump, de-cloak and jump yourself.
 Remember that the first jumper must decal before you, even if he or she waits out the gate cloak timer.
 This is your chance!

, Spam warp like there is no tomorrow. Do not touch MWD or AB modules. They will drastically reduce your warp away time.
 You are not safe in a camped system until cloaked or in a safe spot. If you have no safe spot, make one as you bounce around the planets.


Never warp directly between gates in null sec. Bounce around, and be careful.

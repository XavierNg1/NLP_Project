This program is designed specifically for communities with less than 250,000 people which are experiencing high unemployment, downsizing and closures, an unfulfilled employer demand, or skill mismatches. This means that an additional eligibility requirement to obtain this funding is that you must live in one of these eligible communities.While some of the funding for this program comes from the federal level, there is also funding at the provincial or territorial level. And it’s the province or territory who handles applications.

 You will need two large shank buttons and two small shank buttons. Both large buttons should match each other. Likewise, both small buttons should match each other, too.

The small buttons should be small enough to fit snugly through standard sleeve buttonholes.
On the other hand, the large buttons will work better if they are too large to fit through average buttonholes.
 Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to separate one to three links from a standard metal chain.

The right number of chain links will depend upon the thickness of the chain. You need to separate a section that is just long enough to fit through the thickness created by a folded shirt cuff.
If you don't have excess chain to work with, you can use a small jump ring or piece of elastic hair tie, instead.
 Open one link of the detached chain and slip it into the hole on the back of one large button. Open the link on the opposite end of the chain and slip it into the hold on the back of one small button.

Close both chain links to complete your first cufflink.
If using a single link of chain or jump ring, you'll need to open the ring and insert it through the holes on both the small and large button.
If using elastic hair ties, cut the hair tie and insert it through the holes of both the small and large button. Knot the hair tie so that it is roughly 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) away from both buttons, then trim away the excess elastic., Follow the same steps to create a second cufflink from the remaining small and large button.

Use the same number of chain links for both cufflinks.
The two cufflinks should be identical when finished.
 To put one cufflink on, slide the smaller button through the buttonhole of one sleeve. The decorative faces of both buttons should be visible from either side of the buttonhole.

Put the second cufflink on your other sleeve in the same manner.

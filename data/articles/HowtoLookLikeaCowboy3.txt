 Cowboys work outdoors, not in corporate offices, so their skin is tan, leathery, and coarse from wind and sun, which they often see twelve hours a day, six or even seven days a week.
 Cowboys don't spend a lot of time working on their fingernails, or trying to keep their hands baby-smooth and soft. Cowboy work makes for rough callouses and dirty nails. Cuts, bruises, and scars are regular sights on hands that spend their time working with fences, lassos, horseshoes, and other rough materials.
 A duster is a long leather jacket, usually with large buttons, and sometimes with fringe in various spots. The duster is most appropriate during cold weather or while traveling. Like most things cowboy, the larger buttons are practical – they’re much easier to use with gloves on. A sturdy leather vest is a good substitute when the weather is warm.
 Chaps are perhaps the most extreme of all the cowboy wear. Chaps provide extra protection and while working on horseback and at the rodeo. It’s not advisable to wear chaps in many other settings. The same probably goes for spurs.

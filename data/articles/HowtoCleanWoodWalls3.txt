Shake the mixture well. Then, use a clean cloth to apply the cleaner to the wood walls. Work the cleaner into the wood with the grain in smooth, circular motion.The cleaner will remove surface dirt or dust, leaving a nice warm shine to the wood. It will also give the wood a pleasant lemon scent.

Follow the manufacturer's instructions to apply the cleaner correctly to the wood walls.It may be worthwhile to invest in a commercial wood cleaner and keep it on hand at home. You can then apply it on the walls on a regular basis when it needs a clean, especially if the wood walls are located in high traffic areas like your kitchen or your living room.
 If you are unsure of how to best clean your wood walls without damaging them, contact a professional wall cleaner. Look for a professional wall cleaner online or through friends.

 If you are a woman taking your husband's last name upon marriage, your new name can be automatically accepted without petition.


This means the name change is assumed due to the marriage and the next time you apply for a new driver's license or State ID card, the new name will be put on the documents at your request.
Taking the new name is not required. If you choose to use your previous name when you apply for identification, that is also accepted.
If the couple wish to combine names or if the genders are not traditional, changing the last name will require a petition.
Changing first or middle names will always require a petition.
 If you know you will be changing your name when the marriage license is drawn up, see if the name change can be included.


In some counties or rulings, further petitions like name change can be included in the legal process of marriage, but in others the license will only list the birth names of the individuals who are marrying.
If you can add petitioning to your marriage license, then your options for name changing will be much wider.
 You can find instructions on the Social Security FAQ for how to get the new name on your federal card.

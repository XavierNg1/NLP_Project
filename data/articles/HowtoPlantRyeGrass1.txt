 It’s crucial that you plant your rye grass during the correct season so that it germinates properly. The air temperature should reach between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 24 degrees Celsius) during the day. It’s best to plant rye seed when the temperatures reach that point but may begin to fall in a few weeks (planting rye seed before it starts getting hotter can cause the rye to die)., Rye seed comes in two versions – annual and perennial. The annual seed does not germinate as well as the perennial, which means you’ll need to use more of the annual variety to get the same lush look you could achieve with the perennial. You also have the option of using sod, which is pre-grown patches of rye that you purchase from a nursery and then lay over your prepared planting area., Whether you are seeding or sodding rye grass, you’ll need to fill in the existing soil so that it reaches the correct depth for your rye grass - about 4 to 6 inches (9 to 12 cm). You can use topsoil to fill in low areas, but the composition should have less than 20% clay, and it should not contain any herbicides., This will give the soil the nutrients necessary for your rye grass to grow well. Phosphorous and potassium fertilizer are your best options for use with rye grass.

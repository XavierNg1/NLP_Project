Introduce the topic in your first sentence.
In the sentences that follow, elaborate on the topic by introducing facts or ideas that you intend to use as main points or major sections of your essay.
 Even though this type of introduction requires you to introduce your topic right away, you should never issue a direct statement that states the topic in precise, specific terms.


Phrases to avoid include:

“In this essay, I will write about...”
“This essay will discuss...”
“In this essay, you will learn about...”


Stating your topic in such precise terms creates a stiff, unnatural flow of words. You should strive to make the tone of your introduction professional yet conversational so that the reader can fall into your writing more naturally.
 After you introduce the overall topic, you should conclude the introduction paragraph with a single statement that acts as your thesis.


A thesis statement is a single sentence that defines a specific point or idea about a broader topic that your entire paper is built around.
The portion of your introduction leading to the thesis will often narrow down the topic gradually until you can naturally introduce your specific thesis.
 While this type of introduction can be effective, it can often be boring and is not generally recommended.


The only time that this type of introduction tends to work is when the writer is writing for an audience already interested in the topic. If the topic is strictly factual and not open to much subjective interpretation, then a declarative introduction might be proper.

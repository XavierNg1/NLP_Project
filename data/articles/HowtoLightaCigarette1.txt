, Hold your lighter with your thumb positioned on the spark-wheel. Flick your thumb down while holding onto the button. Your other fingers should be gripping the body of the lighter.Some lighters will have buttons instead of spark wheels. In this case, do the same thing except press the button with your thumb.
It may be easier to light if you use your dominant hand.
 Continue holding the button on the lighter as you bring it to the tip of your cigarette. Allow the cigarette to lay in the flame.


Holding the flame on a lighter for an extended period of time will make the metal on it incredibly hot because of heat transfer.Stand behind a wall or cup your hand around the lighter to prevent the flame from going out.
 This will cause air to travel through the tobacco in the cigarette, causing it to light. This should only take 2 to 3 puffs to happen. Once the cigarette is lit, release the button on the lighter.


Exhaling through your cigarette will cause a flare up from the flame on the tip of your cigarette.

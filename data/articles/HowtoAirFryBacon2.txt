 Since bacon is naturally fatty, grease will likely drip off of the bacon and onto the tray beneath the cooking basket. To prevent the grease from burning and making smoke, add a bit of water to the tray. This will help the grease cool.To minimize the amount of fat that drips from your bacon during cooking, dab individual pieces with paper towel before placing them in the cooking basket.
Smoke from fat and grease is white. If there is ever black smoke coming from your air fryer, turn it off. Once the machine has cooled, look inside the heating element compartment and clear any food that has gotten into it.
 Once you’re finished with the air fryer, turn it off. The machine may have a shut down process that allows the fan to continue running as it cools down. As such, don’t be alarmed if it’s still making noise, just check to ensure it is turned off. The fan will likely turn off after 20 to 30 seconds.Do not handle the air fryer until it has cooled down. Unplug the machine and remove the cooking basket and drawer.
 Be sure to wash the basket, the drawer that holds the basket, and the drip tray beneath the basket. Use a sponge or soft brush to avoid damaging the non-stick coating of the basket. Soaking these pieces in soapy water may make cleaning easier. These items are also likely top-rack dishwasher safe.Wipe down the surface of the machine with a damp clean cloth and spot clean any particular locations that need it.
 After cleaning and rinsing, plug the machine back in. Turn it on for two or three minutes. This will dry all of the components of the machine better than you could by hand. Don't forget to turn it off and unplug it after it has dried.Always store your air fryer in a clean, dry area.

If you're launching a missile, make sure the wind is right and you and your allies won't get hurt. If the targets are not in your sight, press e for an aerial view of the map. Lock him on and set the power and kaboom!
If you are throwing a grenade, stay far enough from an enemy. Set the fuse time and power according to the distance before throwing.
When using a gun, stay close to the enemy, not too close that he can blast you off. Lock on and shoot.
If using close range weapons (firepunch, prod, baseball bat), make sure the enemy is close to the water. Face opposite to the water and throw him (use a prod if the worm is near the water's edge).
If using mobile weapons (old woman,sheep,super sheep), go straight to the enemies in front of you. The old woman can turn, so use her to explode other worms (these weapons can be used to get crates).
If using air strike, take an aerial view and then lock on to a group of enemy worms and then...bombs away!
If using tread weapons (dynamite,mine). If you are near a teleport pad and an enemy worm, place the mine near the enemy and on the teleport pad or if you are near a teleport pad, place a mine on the pad and anyone who comes on that pad will be blown off.
If using the dreadful banana bomb, throw it near a lot of enemy worms, it will nearly kill them all! Or for a bit of fun, set the fuse on 1 and aim directly up with full power; when it blows, bananas will go everywhere!

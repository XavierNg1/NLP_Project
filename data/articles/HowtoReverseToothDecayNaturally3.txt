 You should brush your teeth at least twice a day to help fight off tooth decay. When you brush, make sure you get the inner and outer surfaces of your teeth, the teeth in the back of your mouth, the chewing surfaces of your teeth, and your tongue. Scrub long enough that all the plaque comes off your teeth, but don’t push so hard that you hurt your gums and teeth.


Also use a soft toothbrush. Teeth can also be damaged by using toothbrushes with bristles that are too hard., After you brush your teeth, spit out the toothpaste like normal. Instead of washing your mouth out with water, leave the toothpaste remnants of your toothpaste in your mouth without rinsing. This gives the minerals in your toothpaste some extra time to be absorbed by your teeth., Along with brushing, you should also floss every day. Start with around 18 inches (46 cm) of floss. Take the end of the floss and wrap most of it around the finger of one hand, leaving the rest around one finger of the other hand. Hold a section of floss between your thumb and your forefinger, gently guiding the floss between all your teeth using a gently back and forth motion and curving along the bottom of each tooth.


Once the floss is between the teeth, use a gently up-and-down motion to get the sides of each tooth.
After you do one tooth, unwind more floss and move on to the next tooth.

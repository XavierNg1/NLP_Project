 Once they begin blooming, most annuals will flower throughout the growing season. To keep them blooming, pinch off (deadhead) old flowers as they begin to wilt or fade. As long as the old blooms are removed, the plant will continue to produce flowers. Consult the seed packet to determine if your annuals benefit from deadheading. Some annuals, such as begonias, should not be deadheaded.
 Annuals have shallow root systems, so they require regular watering. For best results, water in the morning so the plants dry in the sun. Soak the soil completely, but be careful not to overwater, which can cause disease and fungus buildup. Monitor the health of your annuals to determine how often you need to water. If leaves or flowers droop or wilt, water the plants immediately.
 Annuals in the ground that were fertilized at planting typically do not need additional fertilizer. However, container-bound pots should be fertilized every few weeks with a water-soluble fertilizer. This will help maintain colorful flowers in the containers.
 Most annuals benefit from mulch, which helps the soil to retain moisture. Mulch also can help keep out weeds. Use organic mulch like shredded leaves, bark, grass clippings or other organic materials to improve the soil around the annuals.
 Some tall annuals can fall over, especially when they are in full bloom with heavy flowers. To keep them upright, stake them with wood and tie the tall stems to the stakes using twine.

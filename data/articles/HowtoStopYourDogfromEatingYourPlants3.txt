 Dogs may exhibit unwanted behaviors due to a lack of exercise.If you make it a point to play with your dog regularly to expend his excess energy, he will likely be less interested in eating plants in the yard or in the house. Games that force the dog to move around a lot while you mostly stand still are best. They include fetching, frisbee catching/fetching, chasing a toy on a rope or stick that you move, catching bubbles, and many more.Be sure dogs have access to water during play.
Always keep safety in mind when playing with your dog.
 Walking your dog not only gives him some great exercise, it also stimulates his mind because of unfamiliar sights and sounds you may encounter on the walk. Use an extendable leash that is retractable, giving the dog lots of room to investigate what he encounters. During the walk, try to walk faster than your normal pace for 30 minutes. Older or out-of-shape dogs may need to start with a shorter walk and work up to a faster, longer walk.Pay attention to signs that display rules for walking dogs in public areas.
Be sure to clean up after your dog when when walking.
 For a more significant workout that will expend more of your dog's energy and hopefully discourage him from eating plants, try running your dog. You can run the dog by taking him with you on the leash while you are in-line skating or bicycling.Always be careful when running your dogâ€”he may have to learn to pay close attention to you during the run instead of stopping to smell things or relieve himself. Take regular breaks to allow him to relieve himself.
Younger dogs whose bones are not fully formed may need some time to develop before a run is appropriate.
Enlist the help of a dog trainer for leash training if your dog has trouble getting used to running.

 This version of the F major chord, nicknamed "old-school F" (as it was popular with musicians in the 60s and 70s), adds one extra note to the F described above, giving it a fuller, rounder sound. It is slightly harder to play than the "mini" F, but easier to play than the full barre chord F described below.
 In other words, place your index finger on the E and B strings on the first fret. This is identical to the beginning of the F played above.
 In other words, place your middle finger on the G string on the second fret. This note is an A.
 In other words, place your pinkie finger on the D string on the third fret. You'll be on an F -- your root note for the chord.
 In other words, place your ring finger on the A string on the third fret.



This is the extra note. Your third finger is now placed on the A string while your pinkie finger is placed on the D string -- you can swap these two fingers around if you like, but most people find this position easier.
If possible, lightly touch the sixth (E) string with the tip of your third finger -- this mutes the string so it can't be heard while strumming.

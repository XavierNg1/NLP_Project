,  A blog is a page on which your WeeMee can post tips, lyrics of the a favorite song, feelings, fashion tips, hobbies. In order to help, post useful tips: How to prevent hacking, getting gold and green points, making friends, fashion tips, animal tips, etc. 

,  World  is a place on WeeWorld where WeeMees can chat.  There are many locations where you can go to!  Patrol! If someone is swearing, cursing, sending sexual messages or bullying, report that user.  Patrol a lot to make WeeWorld a better place! 

,  There are over 40 million users on WeeWorld, and a lot of them are new and need help!  Go in World, spot someone new, go to his homepage and add him/her!  That way you can send a message to the certain user and ask if they need help.  You can also spot someone being rude (check the third step).
  Block the rude users, add people, and have fun!

 Many cats love to have their litter boxes and their beds in out of the way places where they can get a little privacy. However, during the winter you should make sure that the cat's bed and litter box are not so out of the way that they are in cold, drafty locations. Move these items closer to the warm areas of your home, so that your cat doesn't need to get cold to take a nap or go to the bathroom.Also, if you place your cat's litter box in an area that is cold and drafty, the cat is more likely to avoid using it and it might begin going to the bathroom in other places in your home.
 If you want to keep your cat really cozy during the winter, get it a heated cat bed. These beds are available at most pet stores, they plug into regular wall outlets, and they provide gentle heating for your cat.Heated cat beds are particularly good for cats that spend time in cool homes during the day. They can provide your cat a safe place to curl up if it gets chilled.
 If you keep your cat inside during the winter, or limit its time outdoors, you should make sure that it still gets regular and plentiful exercise. Make the time to play with it every day. Provide toys that it enjoys chasing after or batting at even when you are not around.Some simple toys that cats tend to enjoy include toy mice, feathers on sticks, and balls with bells in the middle.
 Even if its cold outside, your cat can benefit from the warmth of the sun. If it is a sunny day outside, make sure that your cat can get to a spot where it can take a nap in the sunshine.If your cat is particularly fond of napping in the sunshine, consider making it a special shelf in your windows for it to soak in the rays.

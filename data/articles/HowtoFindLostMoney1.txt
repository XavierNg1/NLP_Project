 NAUPA is a non-profit organization with the goal of reuniting property with its rightful owners. The NAUPA website is the best place to start because it provides links to all of the state unclaimed property databases in the US. You can search the database for each state that you have lived in to see if you have any lost money., Using the NAUPA website, search for lost money in the state where you have or have had resident status. If you believe that you may have lost money as a result of the death of a loved one, then you will also want to check with the insurance department in the state where your loved one lived., NAUPA provides the links to other legitimate sources for finding lost money such as the IRS, National Credit Union Association, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and more. Make sure to search all of the sources that are applicable to you., Each state and federal website will have a different process for claiming your lost money. After you conduct your searches, you will need to carefully follow the instructions on the website.


If you are having trouble understanding the instructions, you can call the organization and ask for help. There should be a phone number available at the bottom of the web page or on the website's "contact" page.
 If your searches donâ€™t turn up anything and you believe that you have lost money, consider hiring a professional asset detective to locate the funds for you. Just keep in mind that professional assistance can be expensive, so this should only be used if you are certain that you have a considerable amount of lost money.

 Being front and center will encourage you to give your undivided attention to the instructor.That means no time for daydreaming, at least without risking getting caught.


If you have assigned seating and are placed in the back, talk to your instructor. They will most likely let you switch your seat to one closer to the front.;
, Write down key points instead of just copying the board word for word.This will give you more time to engage in class, instead of doing monotonous work.


Make sure that your note taking is tailored to keeping you active during class. Find out if you feel more comfortable highlighting key points or creating dual entry notes. Different styles of note taking will keep active and attentive during the lecture.
Review your previous notes to make sure you are up to date with the current lecture. Try to find some connections between previous lessons and today's. This will help you feel more confident with your lesson and keep that daydreaming at bay.
 Put your hand up to answer questions, and don't be afraid to ask some yourself if you don't understand. When you know the material and participate in class, you won’t be tempted to daydream.


Participating in class doesn’t mean that you always have to have your hand up. Answer only when you have something meaningful to contribute, but make sure you’re recognized. This way you can be held accountable when you start to daze off.
 Ask to use the restroom and take the time to stretch a little or drink some water. This will allow you to refocus when you get back to class. Go back to class ready to ask questions and engage.

 Salads can be just as bad as any entr√©e if they are loaded with dressing. Instead, order what you want to eat with any unhealthy aspects either taken off or put on the side (if you can handle having them there without feeling like you need to eat them).
 If you feel this way then remind yourself that the money you spent on the part of the meal that you didn't eat is just an investment in a healthier you or if you can take the rest of the food home and eat it later.


If you go to a restaurant and find the portions to be large, ask for a take-home box when your food arrives. Place half the meal into the box before you begin to eat. Plan on eating the rest later that day, if you get hungry, or tomorrow. This way you won't feel you've wasted money or food and you'll already have tomorrow's lunch ready to warm up.






Do a little research before you go to the restaurant. There are websites that list the ingredients/nutritional facts for restaurants.

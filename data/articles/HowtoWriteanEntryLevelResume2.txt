 Though there is no hard and fast rule about resume length, it is usually recommended to narrow it down to one page, or two pages at the most.


If your resume is longer than a page, consider cutting out information that is not relevant to the position you are applying for.
 The way that you format your resume will affect the image that your potential employer forms of you. If your resume is sloppy or unprofessional looking, the potential employer may develop a bad opinion of you. Consider things like:


Font: Use one font throughout your resume. Choose a font that is professional looking. Consider using Arial or Times New Roman.
Margins: Your margins should be 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) wide.
Font size: Try to stick to font sizes within the 10 to 12 range.
However, you could consider making each section heading of your resume bold, along with your name and contact information.
 Look at your resume. Does it look like one cohesive document? Are all of your section headings bold? Does each section include bullet points to clarify elements of the subject you are discussing?

, Your resume should be grammatically correct and punctuation error-free. Read through your resume to make sure that you don’t have any errors. Consider reading it out loud to make sure that it does not sound awkward in any sections.


Consider asking someone you trust to look over your resume.

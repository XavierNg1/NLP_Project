 All Windows desktops have Recycle Bins. Locate this; it’s usually right on your desktop. Open it by double-clicking on its icon.
 Select all the files you’d like to restore by clicking on them. Use the normal Windows operations for multiple selections. The files you’ve selected will be highlighted.
 From the menu, click on “Restore the selected items.” The files you’ve just selected will be restored to their previous locations.


You can also use cut and paste to move the files from the Recycle Bin to your OneDrive local folder.

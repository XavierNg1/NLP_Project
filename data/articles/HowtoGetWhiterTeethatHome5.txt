 Where possible, you may be able to prevent further staining by making some lifestyle changes. This includes stopping all smoking, and reducing your consumption of beverages containing tannins––soda, coffee, red wine, and tea all contain tannins.In some cases, you can help keep tannin drinks away from your teeth by drinking them with a straw (do not drink hot liquids through a straw).
 Some foods can actually help you keep your teeth white. Here are a few of them:Eat more apples, celery, and carrots. They're like a fruit and veggie toothbrush for the teeth and they help increase the production of saliva in your mouth, removing plaque.As an added bonus, their high levels of vitamin C help to kill off odor-causing bacteria and strengthen your gums.
Eat more strawberries. They contain a natural astringent (malic acid), which helps to lift stains. To get the most benefits, consider rubbing half a strawberry over your teeth or mashing the strawberry and applying it to your teeth. Leave for one minute, then rinse clear.Rinse with a glass of half lemon juice and half warm water once a week. This will lighten your teeth. Don't do it more than once a week though, as the lemon juice can erode teeth too.Eat more hard cheese. It helps to increase saliva production in the mouth, thereby removing the bacteria that stains teeth and it is also a good source of helpful minerals, such as calcium and zinc.

 If you had a laptop with you during your trip, you can handle this chore after each day's research on your trip; if not, do so as soon after you get home as possible.


If you have a large amount of information to input, make "To Do" and "Done" piles to keep track of what you've done and what you have left to do. This is also the time to add digital photos you've taken to your database program, if it accepts them.
If any of your new findings updates existing information, document both the change and the date you made the change, so that no one else accidentally "corrects" the information back to its original form later.
Back up your database before and after updating it.
 Filing your notes as soon as possible will be easier than waiting until you've forgotten exactly what's in the documents and have to read through them again to file them properly.


Scan key documents with your scanner, if you have one, particularly if you plan to refer to them regularly in your future research or integrate them into a published family history. You'll also want to photocopy them if you plan to show them to people you plan to interview at a later time.
 Let other family members know about what you've discovered, either through a family newsletter, email, website, or social media. You can also offer to share your research with the institutions you contacted to obtain it, if they keep collections of genealogies compiled using their research.


Include your name and address on any information you send so that others can contact you with questions or to offer updates.
 If the answers you find to your existing questions led to new questions about your family history, decide which of those questions you want to have answered and pursue the appropriate research paths to finding those answers.

 The more familiar you are with the health care system, the insurance system, and the specific medical condition your loved one is grappling with, the more effective you can be as an advocate.For example, take some time to learn how the hospital bureaucracy works. What is the "chain of command?" Who does your loved-one's doctor or medical team report to?
Learn about the patient's health insurance policy and/or Medicare aid. Look into the process of appealing when aid is denied.;
, Gather all relevant documents related to your loved-one's hospitalization and treatment.This might include test results, explanations of benefits, bills, and prescriptions.


Keep all these records in one place and organized in such a way that you can find whatever you might need to reference later. Keep the same types of documents together, and organize them by date.
 Keep a journal or notepad handy at all times. Make notes every time you talk to the doctor or other health care professionals.These sessions can be very brief, but contain a lot of information, so keeping track of it all for later later reference can be helpful.


Make note of who you've spoken to and what everyone says.Your loved one may be seen by several different doctors and nurses. Record all their names. This will make it much easier to have conversations later about the recommendations or information provided by each physician.
Make sure to note the date of every conversation as well.Then if you have a question about something you've been told, you can be specific, i.e. "Last Wednesday you told me X, but now you're telling me Y instead. What has changed since last time we spoke?"

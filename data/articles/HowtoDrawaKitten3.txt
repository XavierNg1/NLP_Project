 Draw a cross in the circle for the guidelines of the face.


Note that the body should only be a little larger than the head, and should be at a slight angle away from teh head.
Keep the intersecting point of the cross-lines close to the center of the head.
 Sketch two circles for the eyes and a half circle for the nose.


The eyes should be positioned over the horizontal center line, and should be at equal distance away from the vertical center.
The nose should be on the vertical center line and below the eyes.
 Sketch a small circle for the mouth area covering as well the nose area. This circle should be below the eyes, yet should completely cover the nose and overlap the bottom of the head circle.
 This includes the legs and tail. The front legs should be two slightly curved lines coming off the front of the body oval, starting about three-quarters up and extending to the bottom, pointing away from the angle of the body.


The back legs should be two arrowhead shapes attached to the bottom of the oval.
The tail should be a curved line sticking out from the bottom back of the oval.
 The back of each circular paw should be attacked to the leg lines.
 Draw two inwardly curved lines from either side of the head to either side of the body, forming the kitten's neck.
 Draw thicker shapes around the leg lines and tail line to fill out the limbs. Add curved lines to the front of the paws to look like toes. Add a "W" shaped mouth connecting to the bottom of the nose.


You can also "roughen" the overall outline of the kitten with small, jagged strokes, creating the impression of fur.
 Add more details like the fur lines and the pattern of the fur color, if desired. This can include stripes or other details.
 Use any color you'd like, but make the mouth area slightly lighter so that it stands out. If you added stripes or patterns, color those a separate shade, as well.

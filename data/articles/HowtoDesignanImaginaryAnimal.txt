 You can't design an imaginary animal if you have no idea of what its like! Try thinking of traits you like about other animals, such as the tail of a fox or the wings of a hummingbird.;
, If you have a picture, it will help with everything else you have to decide.
 Does it like to eat meat, veggies or both?

, It can't live without its means of living, can it?

, What does it have to eat to live?

, Who is its prey, and who is its predator?

, Decide its daily tasks.
 Does it kill its husband, does it ever mate, does it come together soon?

, Is it the weight of a grain of sand, or the height of the Empire State Building?

, How does it grow up? Does it grow into a tadpole, turtle or T-Rex?

,, How can you spread about it to your friends if you can't tell them what is its name?

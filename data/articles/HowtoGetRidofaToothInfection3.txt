 Brushing your teeth in the morning and the evening can help to reduce plaque and prevent cavities. Make sure that you use a fluoride toothpaste to brush your teeth and take your time as well. Other good brushing habits include:Brush all surfaces of your teeth (front, back, tops, and along the gumline).
Keep your toothbrush in a stand that allows it to air dry (a moist toothbrush is more prove to bacteria).
Replace your toothbrush every three to four months.
 Flossing is also crucial because a toothbrush cannot reach between your teeth. You can use regular dental floss or pre-threaded flossers to get in between your teeth. When you floss, you should also make sure to:Use a long (18‚Äù) piece of floss so that you will have enough to floss between all of your teeth.
Run the floss up and down the sides of your teeth. Do not just pull the floss in and out between your teeth.
Use a gentle touch. Pressing too hard may cause injury or bleeding to your gums.
 Swishing with an antimicrobial mouthwash or a mouthwash that contains fluoride may also help to improve your dental health. Look for a mouthwash that fights plaque and use it after brushing and flossing for extra protection., Regular checkups can help your dentist to detect any problems, such as tooth decay or plaque build-up. Your dentist can provide treatments to help promote your dental health and fix problems before they get worse. Make sure that you see your dentist twice per year for a cleaning and exam. Also call your dentist if you notice any signs of a problem such as:red, bleeding gums
gums that are pulling away from your teeth
changes in the alignment of your teeth
loose teeth
sensitivity to hot and cold
constant bad breath or a bad taste in your mouth

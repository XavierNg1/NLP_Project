 To reduce the lipid content on meat, use a clean sharp knife to trim off any visible fat. Often cuts of meat will have fat lining the outside of the meat or sections of fat between the layers of meat. Removing these will ensure you are consuming less fat once you cook the meat.If you are eating out and having a dish with meat, try not to eat the sections of fat on the meat. Cut them out or eat around them.
 Vegetable oils like olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil, and avocado oil are all good options when cooking meat. You can also use margarine. You should also cook other foods like vegetables and grains in vegetable oils to reduce your consumption of saturated fats. Using vegetable oils instead of animal fat like butter will help keep the fat content in your meals down.Using vegetable oils and margarine with added stanols and sterols instead of butter will help to lower your cholesterol.
Keep your kitchen stocked with vegetable oils so they are within reach when you are cooking and preparing meat. Get in the habit of drizzling olive oil on meat for roasting and sauteing meat in sunflower oil instead of butter.
If you cook fish at home, you should use vegetable oils to cook the fish. Drizzle olive oil over salmon or cod and bake them in the oven. Grill fish with olive oil or canola oil.
 Broiling or baking meat can help to keep the fat content down in your dishes. Try broiling lean meat instead of pan-frying it. Brown meat under the broiler instead of in the pan to keep the fat content down.When you are baking or roasting meat, use a rack so the fat can drip off the meat as it cooks.
Use wine, fruit juices, or oil-based marinades instead of meat drippings when basting meat in the oven.
If you do pan-fry meat, always use vegetable oils and pan-fry the meat on a lower heat so the fat content is reduced.

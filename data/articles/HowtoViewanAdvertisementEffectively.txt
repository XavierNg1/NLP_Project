 Take a moment to experience how it makes you feel. Is your heart racing? Does the Pitchman have your attention? Are you on the edge of your seat? That's the distraction.;
, Don't just see -Read. Look and listen for the words the Pitchman is using. When you are reading an advertisement, let your peripheral vision ride over the pictures. You'd be surprised how many subliminal pictures there are.
 In Latin phraseology the construction of the description of a round, red, ball would be ball round red. English is not so easy. Try to rearrange the adjectives in your mind. What is the primary adjective? Item: Ball. What is the second? Shape: Round. What is the tertiary (Third, fourth, etc.)? Color: Red.
 They normally belong there, and would describe the item in normal conversation. Advertising is not "normal conversation."

, Ask yourself if the adjectives are appropriate to normal conversation. Especially when watching commercials or videos. Is the comparison realistic? Is it appropriate? Eliminate the adjectives. How does it sound? Is it still captivating and reasonable?

, Is the price realistic to the item? Is it appropriate to the pitch? There's a big difference. Is the Pitchman trying to convince you that you can't live without the newest Widget at the low, low price of $99.95? Is he offering it for $59.95, and then proceeds to knock off one payment? Does he double the deal, and then add bonus items again and again? Can he really sell a $99.95 item for half price, while throwing all those items in free?

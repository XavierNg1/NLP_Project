 Never insert bones, metals, or plastics.


Your disposal and the blades aren’t meant to break down hard, solid objects. Your disposal is only built to break down food to prevent clogs.
Inserting anything that’s solid or too large can prevent the disposal from properly working.
 This is in addition to running the water while it is grinding.


Running the water for half a minute after your disposal grinds up food will ensure that the blades stay lubricated. Water also ensures that you don’t get any food sticking to your pipes or blades.
The running water will help flush down any materials that are sticking to anything.
 Depending on how often you use the disposal, cleaning it naturally will help remove buildup and combat smells.


Cut the lemon in half. Place it in the garbage disposal. Let it run for 2 minutes. The lemon's acidic juices will clean away odors and small clogs.
 You can also use vinegar and baking soda to create a fizzy solution that will help dissolve any grime. Pour hot water down your drain, then add about half a cup of baking soda. Let sit for a few minutes. Then rinse with vinegar and hot water. Let the solution soak for a few minutes before rinsing.

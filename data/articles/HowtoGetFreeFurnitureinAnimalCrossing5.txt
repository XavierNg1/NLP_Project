 Animal Crossing has the Dump, which is a fenced-off area where you can literally just drop items into, Wild World and City Folk has a Recycle Bin located in the Town Hall.

New Leaf replaces the Dump and Recycling Bin with Re-Tail, where you can sell off all unwanted objects and get rid of trash for a fee of 80 Bells. Villagers sell their furniture off there sometimes, but it still requires you to purchase them instead of simply grabbing what you want.
 When you head to the Dump in the original Animal Crossing, the items are just scattered on the ground to be picked up as you please! In Wild World and City Folk, you check the Recycle Bin by pressing A to open it, and the bin’s inventory opens on top of your inventory window., While in the Dump, you can pick items up with the B button, since they’re just lying on the floor. In City Folk and Wild World, once you open the Recycle Bin, you can put useless items there (pitfall seeds, tires, boots, etc.) from your errand running, and take the items that you like and put it into your own inventory. The Recycle Bin clears out every Monday and Thursday at 6 AM, so better make sure you grab all the items you like before then!

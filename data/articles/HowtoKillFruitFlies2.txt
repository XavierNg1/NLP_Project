 Fruit flies are, pretty obviously, attracted to fruit. However, they will flock to any generally dirty area and most rotten foods. Try to throw out bad foods immediately, and keep your trashcan area and drains clean and old-food-free. This will lower the temptation of turning your house into a breeding ground.
 If your flies have gotten to the point where they are noticeable, its likely that they have already laid eggs somewhere in your house. Fruit flies like moist areas, so the culprit locations are typically kitchen and bathroom sink and shower drains. Pour a bacterial digester down your drain to kill off any eggs that may be there. If you don’t have any on hand, bleach can work as a substitute, but being so thin and runny it may not stick well enough to the eggs to kill them., Strangely enough, fruit flies don’t like basil. If you want to use your green thumb to keep this herb fresh and on hand, you will also manage to keep fruit flies out. Grow basil in a small pot and keep it in your house where the flies seem to congregate. Kept near a bowl of fruit, the flies will be less likely to appear in the future.
 Another strange natural remedy, fruit flies are repelled by the scent of cedar wood. Find a way to keep some in your home, either as decoration or for use in a fire, and your fruit fly population should diminish. Keep pieces of it stashed around your kitchen and near breeding grounds to scare the flies away.
 Improve the aroma of your house and ward off flies and other insects by spraying your home regularly with certain essential oils. The scent of lemongrass oil and lavender are repulsive to fruit flies and many other bugs, and cause them to avoid congregating in the area. Mix 10 drops of one of the oils with 2 ounces of hot water, and mist all the rooms of your house with it.

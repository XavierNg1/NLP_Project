 Do you prefer trimmed or gold-trimmed? Also consider the price of the armor, and remember that you shouldn't take it anywhere you might lose it.;
, If it's less than 10, keep in mind that you can't wear trimmed or gold-trimmed melee armor. If it's 40, you can wear just about any F2P-obtainable trimmed/gold-trimmed armor, provided you have completed Dragon Slayer.
 If you have enough to buy the armor from the Grand Exchange, you should consider that.
 There are 4 reliable ways to do this:


Buy it off the Grand Exchange.
Trade another player for it.
Obtain it in a drop party. This is only if it is being dropped by another player.
Complete a treasure trail. This method is the most reliable, although it is members-only and the reward is random. The harder the treasure trail, the more rare the armor.
 Unless, of course, you want to sell it.

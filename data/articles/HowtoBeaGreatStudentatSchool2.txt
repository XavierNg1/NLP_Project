 It reflects on your character and who you are.
 Nobody likes a snob, a know-it-all, or a "get out of my way or I'll punch your brains out!". There's always a good-side of everything, kinda' like yin-and-yang. Think before you do. Also, think about this: who you are and what you do defines what is attracted to you, like a magnet. If you're not a very nice person to others, not very nice things will happen to you, like a scolding, detention, etc. Kinda' like Karma.
 Closing a door on the jerk that humiliated you last block isn't right. There's no need for revenge. Try being polite to other people, it's contagious! Teachers will be more prone to being polite to you too, as well! Not only that, other people will be more prone to becoming friends, etc.
 It makes you look like an idiot. It makes habits. Soon, the words don't even make you feel relieved or anything. Don't do it.
 If you feel like you have to act differently around others or do stuff that you don't want to do while around companions, it's a sure sign of insecurity. If you feel this is interfering with your ability to be a great student, a counselor can help you lots!

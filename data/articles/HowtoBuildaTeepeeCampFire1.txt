Criteria include: No low overhanging tree branches, these could catch fire if the flames leap, and is the Campfire far enough from the tents so that the tents won’t melt;
,
Ring the Campfire area with rocks and dig a depression into the ground to help contain the fire and shelter it from wind
Pile the excess dirt near the fire and Have a bucket of water nearby to be used to put out the fire.



In order to begin building the Campfire, material must be gathered that will be burned in the Campfire.
The Camping Guide from LoveTheOutdoors.com classifies the three types of wood that will be needed to build a successful campfire:

tinder,
kindling,
fuel.


Use material that is already on the ground and is dry, using fresh cut or wet wood will make the fire smokier and is more difficult to catch fire. Pile the firewood a couple yards away from the fire so that it doesn’t catch fire

 Another solution is to give your friend enough confidence ask their crush directly so you don't have to do the leg work.


Discreetly feed your friend affirmations such as, "Everyone knows how confident you are, why not put it to use and ask Nicki how she feels?"
Congratulate them on little steps, such as starting small talk with their crush or asking them for help with some schoolwork.
Give them support even when they falter. If they lose their nerve to talk to their crush at a party, let them know it's okay to be afraid sometimes and that there will be other opportunities to develop a relationship.
 If they feel uncomfortable with their body or lifestyle, start supporting healthy habits. Go to the gym with your friend, sign up for yoga classes, or start up a diet together.
 Sometimes people can gain confidence just by airing out their insecurities. Ask them why they feel uncomfortable confronting their crush, and let them know it's normal to feel anxiety about such an important question.

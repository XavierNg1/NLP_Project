 Hold the dragon fruit in your palm and try pressing the skin with your thumb or fingers. It should be soft, but not too mushy. If it is really mushy, then the fruit is likely overripe. If itâ€™s very firm, it will need a few days to ripen.Only use this method if you are growing and harvesting your own dragon fruit. Squeezing a dragon fruit can leave the fruit bruised, which is inconsiderate to vendors and other customers in a store or market setting.
You can purchase or harvest a dragon fruit that is underripe and leave it out on a counter for a few days at room temperature. It will likely ripen in a couple days. Test the ripeness daily by pressing the skin.
 Dragon fruit can get damaged skin from rough handling and transportation mishaps. For example, if the fruit is not packaged properly during transportation, they may roll into each other. They might also become bruised from being dropped. If damaged the fruit will contain noticeable blemishes and will be much smaller and shriveled due to moisture loss.Check all sides of the fruit and avoid purchasing fruit that has been cracked, split open, or damaged.
 One sign that a dragon fruit may be overripe is a dried out stem. Touch the fruit to determine if the stem is brittle, shriveled, and dried out.

 Tektites are mainly found on forests or mountain regions. They can be seen roaming around these places freely. Once you find a Tektite, you don’t need to approach it, since it will slowly come closer to you once it spots you.;
, Tektites jump in order to move around. It’s also the monster’s attack method. As it comes closer, carefully observe where the Tektite lands as it approaches you, to anticipate where the monster will attack you from.
 Tektites attack by jumping up in the air and slamming its body onto your character. Dodging the monster’s attack is actually pretty easy; once it’s right beside you, it will begin to take one final leap. As the Tektite goes up in the air, quickly jump out of where you’re standing to avoid its body slam.
 After it lands, it will take at least two seconds before it leaps into the air again and try to slam at you one more time. You can use this time to slash the monster with your sword. It takes around two to three slashes of your sword to defeat a Tektite.

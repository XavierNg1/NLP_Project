 Preheat the oven to 375° Fahrenheit (175° Celsius). Grease and flour two 9 inch cake pans.
 In a large mixing bowl cream the softened butter, sugar, and gelatin using hand a or electric blend. Blend for about a minute, until the mixture is fluffy and resembles a reddish color., Crack in the four eggs into the creamed mixture, adding one at a time. Blend and fold in the eggs until there are no more egg streaks., Stir in the cake flour and baking powder in with the creamed butter mixture. Blend on medium speed until the batter is crumbly., Pour in the milk, vanilla extract, and pureed strawberries into the cake batter. Blend on medium speed for about two minutes until the cake batter resembles a bright pink color and is creamy. There should be no more flour streaks., Using a rubber spatula, scrape out the strawberry cake batter and pour it into both cake pans. Scrape the edges of the bowl to remove any excess cake batter off the sides., Place both cake pans in the oven and have the cake bake for about 25-30 minutes, until it rises and the edges are slightly brown. To test if the cake is done, poke a toothpick in the middle of the cake. If the toothpick comes out dry the cake is ready to be removed from the heat., Flip both cake pans on a wire rack. Leave the cakes to cool for about 10 minutes, until cool enough to handle and frost., Stack both cakes together with frosting to form a bigger strawberry cake. Consider frosting the cake with strawberry frosting, cream cheese frosting, or vanilla frosting. Decorate with sprinkles, extra strawberries, cherries, coconut flakes, and/or fondant flowers., Slice a piece of strawberry cake and lay it on a serving plate. Serve with a glass of milk if desired. Enjoy!

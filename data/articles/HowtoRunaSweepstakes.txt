 You will need to have a server that can handle the load. The world is full of people who want something for nothing and a lot of those people invest a lot of time in it! Infrastructure would be:


Server
Mail list support
Database support (for the information received when they fill out entries);
, Learning, and utilizing, the demographics is one of the many uses of data received in a sweepstakes. Be sure the one you get will work for you.



Be prepared for the fallout from the rest of the world!

, Some people just won't get it. Be prepared to either have a bunch of FAQs for every problem they have, or ready to answer all of their emails.
 Some methods that you can use are:


Form entry
A hard-coded link to the form
Have a way for them to enter manually, as in the terms and conditions

, And then Be Compliant.


One things you can do is 'borrow' the terms and conditions from a similar contest and adopt it to your purposes.
 When you start sending out emails, you will get many unsubscribe requests. Especially, if it gets picked up by a sweepstake offering site. You will come out ahead, but be prepared to be narrowing it down for a while.
 There are sites online that will generate a random number for you. Each entry will have a number, so choose a random number from there.
 The costs will come from the infrastructure mentioned before as well as other costs you might incur.

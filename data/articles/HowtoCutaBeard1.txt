 It's important to start with a clean and dry beard. Your facial hair gets just as oily as the hair on your head, so give it a good washing to ensure a clean trim.









Scrub your beard with shampoo in the sink or shower, then pat it dry with a towel. Avoid shampoos that dry out your skin.;
, Combing eliminates tangles and makes your beard easier to trim.









Following the grain of your beard's natural growth, guide your comb through the hair growing along one side of your jaw line. Start at your ear, moving toward your chin.
Don't "fluff out" the beard by combing against the grain. Comb your beard straight. You can always fluff your beard later with your hands.
 Make sure that you've got everything you need: scissors or clippers, comb, towel, and any products you plan on using. You'll also need a reachable outlet if you're using electric clippers.


A multi-angle or three-way mirror can be helpful in seeing the hard-to-reach areas of your beard.
 Clogging the sink with tiny hairs is a good way to irritate your housemates. Likewise, cleaning them up after the fact is difficult and frustrating. Eliminate an annoying clean-up by doing some work ahead of time.


Get a small garbage pail to catch the loose hair.
Lay out some newspaper or a towel to catch the hair.
If you've got a stable portable mirror, trim your beard outside. Discarded hair will simply blow away!

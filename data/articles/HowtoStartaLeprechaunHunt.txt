 Tell the participants in the Leprechaun Hunt that legend has it the leprechauns will only come out on Saint Patrick's Day, so you don't want to miss them.Don't tell them that they're fake and that parents do everything.;
, This step is optional, as you might not be interested in catching your leprechaun and indeed, he may be offended if you do. You might also want to bring a camera, and camouflage clothes.
 It's a lot more fun when two or more people are participating in the Leprechaun Hunt. Children might like to take along siblings, cousins, neighbors and friends.
 Start outside, because it's only natural that a leprechaun prefers the great outdoors. After all, leprechauns wear a lot of green and it stands to reason that green trees and grass provide perfect cover for them.
 If you see any, follow them. Leprechauns may also leave gold coins, or even chocolate coins!

, Since they're most probably scared of dogs, cats, birds and squirrels, it's best to leave Fido home and to not look up the trees for leprechauns. The better places will be where the animals are not.
 That includes trees, holes, and even sheds. The group leader should be prepared to look in tight and strange places.
 They could just be blending in. Are you sure you haven't seen one yet?

, Leprechauns may think it's a real gnome and try to entertain the gnome with conversation or a riddle or two. Other times, a leprechaun may be offended by the work of making one of his friends into a plastic mold.
 Once you've looked everywhere in your yard, start in your house. They might have already gotten inside:


Check near the door, that's where they'll go first.
Follow the same steps as for outside, except step 7.
P.S: Don't forget to check for little green sparkly footprints around the house of even on the cement outside and Don't forget to keep in mind if you find one and make him tell you where his gold is NEVER leave him unattended if you do he may trick you.

 While misspelling or misidentifying the name of the company you're applying to isn't the end of the world, it's not exactly starting off on the right foot. Double-check the following:


The complete name of the company to which you are applying for a job
The name of the person to whom you are addressing the cover letter
The address of the person to whom you are sending the letter
The title of the job for which you are applying and/or its reference number, if it exists

, Would the ideal candidate for this new role be required to make more use of those types of skills? What opportunities are missing in your current role? Answering these questions will help you explain why you are interested in leaving current position. For example, are you looking for:


"room for advancement"
"an opportunity to learn new skills"

, This may seem like an obvious question, but knowing how to clearly define your current role is a tremendous asset. For example, you could be a:


"graduate student in environmental science"
"customer service professional specializing in the high-end retail market"

, For example, you could have:


"fifteen years of excellent customer service experience"
"an outstanding background in scientific research and discovery"
"a solid history of dependability in the automotive industry"

, List a few in your cover letter, such as:


"extensive experience with start-ups"
"demonstrated ability to solve problems"
"refined ability to manage teams"
What will you help the company accomplish, if given the job you desire?
"increase its bottom line"
"meet its goal of providing only the best in customer service"
"expand its customer base and increase its revenue"

, Is it:


"entry-level"
"management"
"senior level"

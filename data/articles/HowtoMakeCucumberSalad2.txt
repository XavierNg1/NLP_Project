 Place the thinly-sliced cucumbers into a colander or strainer. Sprinkle Â½ teaspoon of salt over them. Toss the cucumbers together to distribute the salt.
 If your sink is very clean, you can set to colander into it during this time. You can also set the colander or strainer into a large bowl instead. Do not refrigerate the cucumbers during this time.
 Lift the colander or strainer out of the bowl and shake it to dislodge any moisture. Pour any liquid that's in the bowl into the sink, then wipe the bowl clean.
 Cover your work surface with paper towels. Spread the cucumbers on top in an even layer. Cover them with another layer of paper towels. Gently press on the paper towels to soak up any excess moisture.
 Place the sour cream into the bowl, then add the chopped dill or chives. Pour in the vinegar, then add in the pepper and the rest of the salt. Mix everything together with a fork or whisk.


If you don't like vinegar, or don't have any, use lemon juice instead.If you don't like sour cream, or can't find it, try plain yogurt instead., Add the cucumbers to the bowl first. Gently stir them in using a large spoon or rubber spatula. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often.
 If you prepared it ahead of time, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, then leave it in the fridge for up to 24 hours.

 A Realtor, Attorney, or your Lender can help you with this by answering a few questions.Is there more owed on the property than it's present market value?
A comparable Market Analysis (CMA) or appraisal can be ran to determine the market value of the property.Are you presently behind on payments, or anticipate falling behind on payments in the near future?
Lenders realize that there are many factors that contribute to a potential default. Many lenders are eager to head off future problems at the pass.Is there a hardship?
Examples of hardship are:
* Unemployment
* Divorce
* Medical emergency / sudden illness
* Bankruptcy
* Death;
,,, The contract is contingent upon you and your Lender coming to an agreement on the terms of the short sale.


Note: A short sale is dependent on a buyer making an offer to purchase. If you do not receive an offer, there is nothing for the Lender to review, and therefore, you will not qualify for a short sale. So even if you meet all the other criteria, it is possible that no one will offer to buy your home. A successful short sale is also dependent on the lender accepting the buyer's offer. If the lender rejects the offer, a short sale will not take place. In this case, a new, stronger offer will need to be submitted if the lender allows enough time before foreclosing.
 You and the buyer sign the letter and the escrow period begins.

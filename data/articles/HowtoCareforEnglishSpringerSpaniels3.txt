 After adopting your dog, determine if the dog has been to the vet. The dog should have been taken to the vet at six weeks to check for any abnormalities and to be dewormed for the first time.If you adopt a young puppy, around eight to 10 weeks old, you probably need to take her to the vet to get additional deworming treatments and follow-up vaccinations, such as another distemper vaccine, Lyme disease vaccine, and a rabies vaccine.
 To protect your puppy, get a heartworm preventative from your vet. This can be started at eight weeks of age.


Heartworms can cause major medical issues, so starting her on treatment early will help prevent her from developing them., If you do not plan on breeding your English springer spaniel, then you should get her spayed (or neutered if a male). This helps prevent unwanted pregnancies and hormone related behavior, such as heats.


It also decreases the chance of certain tumors and infections.

 Each player will have a short amount of time to make a word. If you successfully make a word within the time limit, the tiles will display the word "Next." If you don't make a word, the tiles will display the word "Out," which means that you have been eliminated from the game., After “next” or “out” appears on the screen, a new set of 5 letters will be displayed. The next player must make a 5-letter word from those letters within the time limit and pass the tiles along.As the game progresses, the amount of time to recognize and make a 5-letter word will grow shorter.
 Keep passing the tiles until all but one player has been eliminated from the game. The last player left is the winner!

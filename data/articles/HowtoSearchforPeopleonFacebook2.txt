 Look for the Facebook app on your mobile device. It’s the one with the app icon with the Facebook logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 Tap the button with three horizontal bars on the upper left corner to bring out the main menu. Tap “Friends” from here. You will be brought to the “Find Friends” screen.
 Unlike on the main website, you cannot search for people using the filters, such as location, school, or employer. In order to search for old friends using the mobile app, you have to know their name, email, or phone number.


Tap the “Search” button on the header menu bar. Enter the name, email, or phone number of your an old friend in the box, and tap “Search” on your keypad. A list of people matching your search parameters will be displayed.
 Browse through the results. If you find the one you’re looking for, tap the “Add Friend” button beside his name. Your friend will be notified, and he will have to accept your request before you two become official Facebook friends.

 Craigslist has a lot of rules about posting to their site, make sure you read and follow all of them. Craigslist does not allow adult ads in the U.S. anymore, so be careful your ad mentions that you are looking for models. Use the term figure modeling or undraped art model instead of “nude modeling” so that it’s clear that you're not running some kind of webcam service or other prohibited activity.;
, Craigslist checks your IP address to make sure you are posting locally. The problem with using your IP to determine your location is that the method is terribly unreliable. If Craigslist gets your location wrong your post will not appear and you will not receive any kind of notification that it is not posted. In fact, you may receive a message that your post was successfully posted when in fact it is not (this is called ghosting.) If your IP address is inaccurate, try switching off your router and switching it back on, your service provider may assign you a new IP address. You may have to complain to your Internet service provider, or even change services, if you are unable to obtain a local IP address.
 Craigslist has a system for reporting inappropriate ads. Sometimes this system results in legitimate ads being removed from the site, though Craigslist claims the occurrence of this is very low. You may find that ads you place in the evenings are never flagged for removal, though ads placed first thing in the morning sometimes are; experiment. If you have trouble with flagging, read the terms of use carefully, and try posting again in a few days.
 Don’t copy and paste from another window; CL may even use software to detect pasting.

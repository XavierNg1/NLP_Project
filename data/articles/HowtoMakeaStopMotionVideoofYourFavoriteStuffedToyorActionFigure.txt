 It's easier to do a stuffed animal with no arms to start out with. If it's an action figure this it pretty much unavoidable but it won't matter because the limbs of an action figure will stay in place, unlike that of a stuffed animals.;
, For example, build a bedroom, kitchen, living room (den), bathroom and use stuff that's on scale (like a doll stuff). You can substitute things like refrigerators by using something like a box and covering it with paper, or to make a t.v. you can use an old mirror and draw buttons and stuff on it to look like a plasma screen
, It should be simple at first. After you get better, you can do more complex movements like going through your character's daily routine. This can be fun and entertaining to watch.
 A camera with a tripod is recommended when making a stop motion video. The camera and framing should not be moved unless you want to change the scene. This will clearly show the movements of the characters. If you want to show a slow movement, slightly move the characters. If you want them to move at regular speed, move them about a centimeter each frame. For fast movement, move the character an inch or so.
 Import all the pictures that you took. There should be at least 170-200 images.
 Use Windows Movie Maker or other video editing software to process and edit the images. Open or drag all the images that you will use in the timeline.
 Click on the first image then go to Edit and change the Duration field. Make it to 0.125 which means 25 frames per second. Do this to all the images. Also, make sure that the images are sequenced correctly.
 Show it to your friends and family. Burn it on a DVD, put it on Youtube, or do whatever you want!

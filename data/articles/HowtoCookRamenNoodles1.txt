 Pour 2Â½ cups (590 milliliters) of water into a saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stove and bring the water to a boil over high heat., Tear open the seasoning packet that came with your ramen. Pour the contents into the boiling water and give it a stir., This ensures that the powder dissolves completely and that the water is hot enough for the next step., Gently press down on the noodles with a chopstick or a wooden spoon so that they sink into the water. You may have to hold them down for a little bit. Do not break the noodles in half or stir them. They will separate on their own.You can also cook the noodles separately in a pot of boiling water., Once they start to break apart, pull them out of the broth using a pair of chopsticks or tongs.You can also pour the broth into a serving bowl through a strainer.
 This will help stop the cooking process and prevent them from turning limp and soggy. You can use a hand-held fan, a little electric fan, or even a stiff piece of paper or a folder.Another alternative would be to rinse the noodles under cold water., At this point, you can add some tasty toppings, such as an egg, meat, or vegetables.Some toppings should be added at the last minute, after you've already poured the ramen into a serving bowl.
 Pour the ramen into a large, deep bowl. If you added a pouched or fried egg into the pot, consider scooping it out with a soup ladle, then placing it back on top of the ramen, after it's already in the bowl. At this point, you can also add other toppings, such as cooked meat.

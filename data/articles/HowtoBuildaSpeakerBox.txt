Reference the speaker’s template to find the speaker’s measurements.
The template is included with the rest of the basic speaker information upon purchase. If the template can’t be found, contact the manufacturer for the information or measure the speaker yourself:



Figure the depth (front-to-back dimension) of the speaker box by adding 2 inches (5 cm) to the depth of the speaker.
Use the speaker’s height and length measurements as the box’s internal height and length dimensions.

Multiply the depth, height and length to determine the internal volume of the box.;
,


Adjust the measurements as needed until you reach the recommended range.
,


Use your measurements to sketch out the speaker box depending on the space you need to fit it into.



Trace a pattern onto the MDF (medium density fiberboard) using the exterior box.
Include the circular openings needed for the face of the speaker and the connectors. The measurements are found on the speaker’s template. If there is no template, trace the circumference of the face of the speaker on the front piece and a 2-inch (5-cm) hole on each side piece for the connectors.


Use a jigsaw to cut out the pattern pieces.
Cut out the circular openings with a router.
Sand all rough edges.



Cover 60 percent of each interior edge with a batten.
Screw the batten into the MDF.
,


Use furniture clamps to keep the speaker box aligned.
,


Remove the speaker and pre-drill the mounting screw holes.
Allow the glue to dry.



Let the silicon caulk cure for 12 to 24 hours.



Hook up the speaker wires.
Cover the back, top and bottom of the speaker box with 1 inch (2-1/2 cm) of poly fill to minimize resonance.
Insert the speaker and run the connectors through their appropriate holes.
Secure the speaker with screws through the mounting holes.
Caulk any openings to ensure the speaker box is airtight.
Allow the caulk to cure for 12 to 24 hours.

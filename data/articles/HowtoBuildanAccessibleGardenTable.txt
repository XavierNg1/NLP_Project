 To begin this project, you'll either need to have the proper sizes already, or you'll need to cut them yourself. You'll need:


One 2x10x10ft board cut to 2 x 36in, 2 x 20in lengths
One 2x2x8ft board cut to 2 x 33in, 4 x 7in lengths
Two 1x2x8ft boards cut to 6 x 20in lengths
Four 2x4x6ft boards cut to 8 x 3ft lengths
One 1/2"x6ft PVC cut to 1 x 36in, 1 x 32in, 1 x 4in lengths;
,


For this step: two 2x10x36in boards, two 2x2x33in boards, four 2x2x7in boards, 2in wood screws.
Be sure there is a 1.5-in gap between the ends of the 2x2s and the short edge of the 2x10 boards before attaching (the side boards will fit into those gaps).
Lay the boards flat on the ground while drilling and screwing.



For this step: one 2x10x20in side board, 2in wood screws.
Be sure the screws go into the 2x2x7in boards.
Butt up the side board to the back board and hold in place while screwing in.

Do not worry if the box feels wobbly right now; it will be sturdy when legs are attached.



For this step: six 1x2x20in slats.



For this step: 1in wood screws.



For this step: eight 2x4x3ft boards, 2in wood screws.
It helps to use clamps to hold the boards together while screwing.



For this step: 2in wood screws.
It helps to turn the box on its side when attaching the legs.
An extra set of hands is helpful here to hold the box in place while drilling.



For this step: 2in wood screws

For this step: one 36in PVC pipe, 1/16in drill bit, marker.
Use the diagram as a template of where to mark the holes on the pipe (hold pipe up to photo and mark where the red dot lines intersect the pipe).
Mark dots with the marker at 1in intervals along the sprinkler pipe in line with your initial markings.
Drill each marked dot with the 1/16" bit. Do not drill all the way through the pipe.



Make sure you are in a well ventilated area when using PVC pipe glue!
For this step: (1) PVC end cap, (2) PVC sprinkler pipe (from Step 12), (3) PVC 90 degree elbow, (4) 32in piece of PVC, (5,6,7) PVC Union, (8) 4in piece of PVC, (9) PVC slip-on female hose adapter, PVC pipe glue.
Be sure the sprinkler pipe is facing downwards when gluing!
Be sure the union joint sleeve (5) is on the pipe before gluing the union flange (6) in place.
Glue together at all connections highlighted in blue.
Set aside when completed and move on to next step.
 Before adding internals (and dirt!) now is the best time to move the garden box to your desired location.



For this step: 40in of 24in wide 1/2in squares hardware mesh, 40in of fine metal screen (used for screen doors), 12ft of 36in wide weed block fabric, staple gun, at least four bags of dirt to fill (what you use is up to you!).
(1) Lay 1/2" grid hardware cloth across bottom of garden box, there should be 2" up on all sides, fix in place with staple gun.
(2) On top of grid lay fine metal screen, staple in place.
(3) Layer weed block fabric (for drainage) 4-6 layers thick and staple to edges of box.
(4) Pour in bags of dirt.



For this step: 1/2in conduit fastener, 1in wood screws.

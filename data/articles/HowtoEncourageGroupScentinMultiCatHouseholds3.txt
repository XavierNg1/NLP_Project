 Objects like shoes and shopping bags bring strange smells into your home. These new scents can potentially disrupt your cats’ group scent, especially if you’re just beginning to encourage a common scent among newly introduced cats.Rub furniture or other objects that you can’t just leave at the door with socks or other scent items so they smell like your cats. If possible, rub them before you bring them into your home.  

, Try to avoid cleaning all of your cats’ beds and other washable items at the same time. Instead, wash one bed at a time so other bedding will preserve the group scent.After washing a bed, try rubbing the cat that uses it most with a towel, then rub the bed with the towel to transfer the cat’s scent.
 Most people want to neutralize strong cat odors in their homes. However, completely eliminating a common scent with cleaning products can disorient your cats, making them uncomfortable with each other and their surroundings. Try to use fragrance-free products instead of scented litter and strong-smelling cleaning products like ammonia., If there’s any competition for resources, your cats won’t want to groom each other or engage in other social behaviors that establish a group scent. Key resources include food and water bowls, litter boxes, beds, scratching posts, and high perches. If possible, provide one of these resources for each cat you own, plus one extra.For example, if you have four cats, try to provide five of each resource.
Place each resource throughout your home. If your cats stay in two or more distinct social groups, make sure each group’s territory has plenty of each resource in equal proportions.

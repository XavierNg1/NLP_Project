 This is particularly important after the 6th week of pregnancy. Allow her to rest as long as she needs to, as pregnancy can be exhausting.


If you have a working dog, talk to your veterinarian about an appropriate exercise plan.
 Daily walks are a great low-intensity exercise for your pregnant dog. Most dogs can continue daily walks throughout their pregnancy.


Choose an appropriate time of day for the weather in your neighborhood (ie, early morning during the summer or mid-afternoon in the winter).
If your dog jogged regularly before getting pregnant, she can continue to do so for the first 4-6 weeks of pregnancy. After the 6th week, however, discontinue jogging in favor of daily walks.
 This means that you should avoid taking her to the dog park or on routes in your neighborhood that are heavily populated with dogs. This will help keep her protected from infectious diseases that could seriously harm both her and her puppies.


Also, pregnant dogs and dogs with young puppies can have behavior changes. Your dog may become aggressive towards other dogs if she feels that they are threatening her puppies.

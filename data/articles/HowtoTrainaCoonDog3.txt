 If you have the means, trap a live raccoon. While it is in a cage, allow your puppy to investigate it. This should be done after they have successfully tracked a scent from the drag trail. This way, the scent is still fresh and they can associate the scent that they recognize with a live animal.


Allow the puppy to sniff around the cage. They will likely begin to bark, which you should encourage. The loud and booming bark of a coonhound is what will alert you that they are on the trail of a raccoon in the woods so you can shoot it.
 This should only be done if you have fully trained your dog to respond to the come command and you have no doubts that your dog will respond to your calls. This should not be attempted with a dog that is not fully trained in basic obedience. You can release the raccoon from the trap into open area.
 Once the raccoon is out of sight, release your dog from their leash and allow them to chase after the raccoon. They will likely bark loudly and enthusiastically follow the scent of the raccoon into a wooded area.
 Your coonhound will follow the scent and tree the raccoon. If they are unable to find the raccoon, you will need to stop them from searching from the scent and revisit scent training.

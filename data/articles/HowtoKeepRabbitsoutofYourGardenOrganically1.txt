 A 1 gallon (4 liter) milk jug works well. Warm water will help your repellent mix faster, but cold water works fine too.;
, Squeeze in a little dish soap, about 1 tbsp (15 mL). This will help your mixture stick to your plants. This also causes the repellent to mix through the water, instead of floating on top.
 If you are using a gallon (4 L) jug, mix in 1 tbsp (15 mL) hot sauce. If you have a smaller, 1 quart (1 L) jug, add 1 tsp (5 mL) instead. Close the lid and shake to combine.


Leave the bottle in the sun to speed up mixing., If you have a large garden, you may wish to purchase a large garden sprayer from a home improvement store or gardening store. Otherwise, any spray bottle will do.


Be cautious when using spray bottles that once contained commercial cleaning products. If the label warns against reusing the bottle, it may cause harm to the rabbit, plants, or people who eat the plants.
 Most rabbits feed at night, so spray your plants shortly before the sun goes down. Spray any plants the rabbits have been feeding on. When the rabbits taste the unpleasant substance, they should stop feeding.


If you know where the rabbits enter the garden, you can spray the plants at that border. They may give up and turn around.
Some plants may get "scars" on their leaves from this spray. If this happens, spray on the ground around the plant instead.
 Spray the plants again every two or three days. Spray again any time rainfall or heavy dew washes off the mixture. Once there are no bite marks on your plants, the rabbits have learned their lesson and you can stop spraying those plants. This may take a few weeks, but in the meantime the rabbits shouldn't be eating enough to cause damage.

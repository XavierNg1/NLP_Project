 If no one has one, produce one of your own.


Any small object can be used in place of the coin but it must be no larger than the size of the coin and something that is easily concealed and held onto.;
,,






Reach toward the coin with your right hand so that your thumb is going behind the coin and your fingers are going in front of it. The fingers of your right hand will obscure the coin from the audience's view.







Relax the thumb of your left hand, allowing the coin to drop to your fingers.






Continue the grasping motion with your right hand, but do not actually grab the coin. If you have done this correctly, the audience will now believe the coin to be in your right hand.
 At the same time, swing your left hand in a relaxed motion to a normal position by your side. At this point, it's best to drop the object into your pocket so that your left hand can remain free to move around or reveal that it, too, is empty.


To help encourage the audience to watch your right hand, patter a little about the need to watch that hand closely.

You will need to uncurl your baby’s foot gently before you begin to put the shoe on.
If your child will be wearing sneakers, put a pair of socks on your baby first. Make sure that the socks you choose will not be too hot and will help your baby’s feet breathe. Cotton and cotton blends work well to prevent overheating.
You will need to gently slide the shoe onto your baby’s foot. It is important to make sure that you do not pinch the skin of the foot, as this will not only hurt but can also leave red marks on your baby’s foot.
 Try to stabilize his foot with one hand while you slip the shoe on with in the other. If your baby is resisting, he may stiffen his foot and try to curl his toes upwards. Gently stroking his foot while sliding the shoe on can help him to relax and relax his foot.
 When you have finished putting the shoe on your baby, check to make sure that the shoe fits him correctly. You don’t want the shoe to fit too tightly, however, you don’t want it to fit too loosely either. If the shoe is either too tight or too loose, it can cause your baby to develop painful blisters on his feet. If the shoe is too tight, it can interfere with your baby’s foot receiving the proper circulation that it needs. Be sure to check your child’s foot regularly and watch for signs of redness and irritation.

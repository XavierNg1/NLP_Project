 Make sure when you're in the shower doing so, that you really create volume by massaging the roots!;
, Be sure not to blow-dry it all the way, only partially.
 Work it through your hair with your fingers and really push the roots up.
 Now section your hair into 3-4 parts. While parting, gather the parts and put each one in an elastic.
 This helps so that you do not curl too far up the hair. Remember, the curls need to be very loose!

, Tease your hair with a wide-toothed comb but not too much. This look is meant to be "classy and careless". You can also turn your head over, shake it lightly, and run your fingers through the top of your hair and try separating the curls.

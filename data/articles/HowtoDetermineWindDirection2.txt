 Look for a dark pool of water. Watch how the ripples flow over the water. These ripples are formed by the wind pushing the water and breaking its surface. The ripples will flow in the direction of the wind., As you are looking out over the water, find a horizontal (left to right) stretch of water that is roughly 15 yards (14Â m) wide. Observing the direction of this strip is a more accurate representation of wind direction than watching individual ripples. The strip will travel the same direction that the wind is blowing., When detecting subtle variations in wind direction, such as on a sailboat, you should be looking forward and back. Watch how the wind is affecting the water in front of you by observing a horizontal stretch of ripples in front of you. Also, glance back behind you to see how the wind is behaving there. This allows you to observe changes in the wind directly rather than waiting for your boat to react.Whether you are looking forward or back, you will use the same technique of identifying a horizontal stretch and observing the ripples.

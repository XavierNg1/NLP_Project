 Staying well-hydrated is one of the most important steps to take when combating nausea. Try drinking an extra 16 oz of water beyond what you normally drink at night., Many doctors recommend ginger or peppermint tea as a remedy for nausea. The teas and their scents can help calm your stomach. You can also try either flavor in different forms â€” ginger in foods is common, and peppermint candies can also help., Many people find that the bubbles of carbonation can help an upset stomach. Choose ginger ale or citrus-flavored carbonated beverages. Use sparingly, since soda is not very healthy. A small glass can sometimes help, often coupled with some crackers or other bland food.

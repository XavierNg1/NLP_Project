 If your scalp produces a lot of oil, egg yolks will be too rich for your hair. Use only the whites in your mask. Egg whites gently remove unwanted oils from hair, leaving it shiny and soft. Separate the whites from the yolks and set the yolks aside.To easily separate an egg, crack the egg on the rim of the bowl. Hold the egg upright over a bowl and carefully lift the top half of the shell. Pass the yolk back and forth between the shell halves and let the white drop into the bowl,

, Pour the olive oil into the bowl with the egg whites and whisk until the mixture is smooth and creamy. You should end up with about half a cup of mask mixture, enough to coat medium-length hair.


If your hair is very thick and long, add an extra tablespoon of olive oil or an extra egg white.
If your hair is short, reduce the olive oil by a tablespoon or leave out an egg white.
 If your hair is a little wet, it will be easier to distribute the mask from your roots to your tips. Use a wide-toothed comb to come the mask through your hair, making sure it gets coats every strand.


If you tend to have extra dry ends, use more mask mixture on your tips than on your roots.
If you end up with more of the mixture than you need, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.
 To keep things neat, you might want to put your hair up in a loose bun and cover it with a shower cap. Wait patiently while the mask goes to work on your dry hair.
 The shampoo will remove excess oil and egg, leaving your hair shiny and soft with no buildup. Be sure to use cool or lukewarm water so the egg doesn't "cook" in your hair.
 Either let air dry or use a hair dyer. Your newly moisturized hair should look shiny and vibrant now.

 You're going to need a variety of different colored fruits. Aim for fruit that will go well together on a kabob, coming in the six basic colors of the rainbow. Try to get different colored melons, tropical fruit, berries, etc. While you're there see if you can find skewers to put the fruit on. They should be in the aisle with the pots, pans, and cooking utensils. Ask for help if you can't find them.;
,, Good ideas for red fruit are: watermelon, strawberries, red delicious apples, cherries, grapefruit, and raspberries. Cut up the red fruit you're going to use into cubes or wedges (with the exception of cherries, berries, and grapes) and place one piece on the end of the skewer.

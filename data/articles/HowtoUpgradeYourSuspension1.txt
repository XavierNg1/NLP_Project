 This might be something as simple as buying the next-more-expensive OEM replacement, or by going so far as to add fancy high dollar upgrades that might well have the side effect of wrecking your driving experience, even as they add a little more of the desired stability and reliability.;
, Consulting with your local counterman is a good idea, but keep in mind that he is out to sell you product, and might not be as much of an expert as he thinks he is.


Any time you veer away from OEM equipment you are taking a gamble, and as a general rule, the industry translates 'improvement' and 'upgrade' as stiffer, less pliable shocks.
This can help you control a saggy rear end and might do a better job of keeping your tires on the ground where you need them, but doesn't translate to a smooth or comfortable ride.
 It is very difficult to predict how after-market shocks will affect your overall driving experience, despite the many claims made by marketing experts and salesmen.


That said, if you mean to be carrying heavy loads up to and including towing, it is probably a good idea to go for heavy duty shocks, even coil-over or air shocks, to keep your rear end from bottoming out.

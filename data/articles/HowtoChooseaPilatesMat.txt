 If you do Pilates in a small, carpeted area, you may be able to get a thinner, narrower mat. If you have more space or a harder floor surface, get a thicker, wider mat.;
, The purpose of the Pilates mat is to help support and cushion your body as you do exercises on it, so it is important not to get a mat that is too thin.
 Measure your height and body width to check against a mat's dimensions at the store or when reading product details online. If possible, lie down on the mat to see how it accommodates your body.
 Touch the mat if you can to see how it feels and whether it will provide you with a good grip. Find a mat that will prevent you from slipping or sliding as you exercise and may perspire.
 This may be important if you do Pilates at a gym or other location where you need to bring your own equipment or simply want to put away your mat after exercising. Consider getting a mat that can be rolled up or carried by a strap.
 The extra thickness can give you more support and protection against potential injuries. You may want to have a mat made of foam underneath a thin mat.
 Certain mats may be manufactured and marketed for either Pilates or yoga, but you can try using a combination of both types in your Pilates workouts.
 This may be an option if you are taking classes at a Pilates studio that provides equipment for their students. By using different mats, if offered, you can decide which ones you prefer.

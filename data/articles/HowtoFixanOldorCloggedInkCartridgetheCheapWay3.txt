 This should be either electronic, sponge or open head. Electronic heads are normally covered with orange wire strips. Sponge heads are obviously sponge which can be touched. Open heads are a hole with nothing in them but ink.


For electronic heads, simply throw in trash. These heads are unreliable, especially if you don't print every day.

Get rid of your printer. Give it away. Deliver it to your local thrift store.
Buy a printer with sponge or open heads. These almost never dry out because the system keeps them sealed. Usually you will find these in printers with four or more cartridges; three separate colors and one black (aka CMYK).


If you have a sponge or open head cartridge, and you already did the other methods to no avail, your cartridge is dead. The ink has dried and hardened to a point it cannot be salvaged. Buy a new one. They can usually be found cheap on Ebay.

 Oftentimes your body will react faster than your brain when you are under emotional stress. Rather than trying to ignore these sensations, pay close attention to them. Notice these physical signs of anxiety, stress, or anger:Rapid heartbeat or increased blood pressure
Muscle tension or shaking
Sweating
Nausea or upset stomach
Headaches
Clenching your jaw or teeth

, When you feel yourself in mind and body getting angry, it may be best to step away from the situation. Try to excuse yourself if possible. Try also giving yourself some physical space between you and the emotionally-charged situation.Consider stepping away from your desk or office. Take a walk around the office. Get outside for a few minutes for fresh air.
Excuse yourself to the restroom. Being in the restroom may give you the opportunity to separate yourself from a difficult meeting or situation.
If there is a one person who is specifically upsetting you, ask to speak with them at a later time. Try not to get into an argument with them in that moment.
 At your desk or in a private space at your work place, try stress reduction exercises that are helpful in calming the mind. This will help to lower your blood pressure and redirect your negative thoughts away from anger. Try deep breathing exercises. One example of this is to slowly inhale your breath for five seconds. Hold your breath and close your eyes for five seconds. Then very slowly exhale for five to ten seconds. Repeat this exercise multiple times until you feel less upset.
Engage in visualization exercises. Close your eyes. Imagine a comforting and safe space. It can be real or imaginary. As you imagine this place, think about the colors, smells, sounds, and sensations. This place should be a relaxing and soothing place that makes you feel better.

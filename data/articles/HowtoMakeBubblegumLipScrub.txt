 Using a tablespoon, sprinkle 2 tbsp of sugar into the small bowl. This is the scrub part, so it is vital that you use only 2–3 tablespoon (29.6–44.4 ml) if you are altering the recipe.;
, Add a 1/2 tsp to the sugar. This is a rough estimate as the amount you add can be altered depending on how liquefied you want your scrub to be.
 It should look an opaque peach. Continue stirring this mixture until you are satisfied that all the virgin-oil is absorbed by the sugar.
 If you feel that there is not enough lip-scrub, add more sugar and more virgin oil and continue to add small amounts until you are completely satisfied that there is enough to fill your container.
 You can find this at any local supermarket. Ironic though it is, it doesn't taste/smell of strawberry, but it does smell/taste of bubblegum. Add as much as you see fit, though the recommended amount is a 1/2 tbsp.
 Rose-pink is recommended, however the colour can be altered. Either tilt the bottle into the cap and pour in a capful, or just tap the bottle onto the side of the bowl and add it that way.
 It may take a while to mix, bu it'll be worth it when you see how beautiful it turns out. It is vital that it all gets stirred in properly, otherwise if some food colouring is loose and it gets on your lips, it will stain your skin.
 It should look somewhat like coloured sand.

 A tic-tac-toe grid is two sets of parallel lines that intersect each other perpendicularly. The lines form three rows and three columns and looks like the pound key (#) on a phone or keyboard. Write your first number in the top-center square of the grid. Write your second number in the top-right square of the grid.For example, if you are trying to find the least common multiple of 18 and 30, write 18 in the top center of your grid, and 30 in the top right of your grid.
 Write this number in the top-left square of your grid. It is helpful to use prime factors, but you don’t necessarily have to.

For example, since 18 and 30 are both even numbers, you know that that they both have a factor of 2. So write 2 in the top-left of the grid.
 Write the quotient in the square below either number. A quotient is the answer to a division problem.

For example, 18÷2=9{\displaystyle 18\div 2=9}, so write 9 under 18 in the grid.


30÷2=15{\displaystyle 30\div 2=15}, so write 15 under 30 in the grid.
 If there is no factor common to both quotients, you can skip this and the next step. If there is a common factor, write it in the middle-left square of the grid.

For example, 9 and 15 both have a factor of 3, so you would write 3 in the middle-left of the grid.
 Write this new quotient below the first ones.

For example, 9÷3=3{\displaystyle 9\div 3=3}, so write 3 under 9 in the grid.


15÷3=5{\displaystyle 15\div 3=5}, so write 5 under 15 in the grid.
 Follow this same process until you reach a point where the last set of quotients have no common factor.
 You can think of it as drawing an “L” for “least common multiple.” Write a multiplication sentence using all of these factors.For example, since 2 and 3 are in the first column of the grid, and 3 and 5 are in the last row of the grid, you would write the sentence 2×3×3×5{\displaystyle 2\times 3\times 3\times 5}.
 When you multiply all of these factors together, the result is the least common multiple of your two original numbers.For example, 2×3×3×5=90{\displaystyle 2\times 3\times 3\times 5=90}. So, the least common multiple of 18 and 30 is 90.

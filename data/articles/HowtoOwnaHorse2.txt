 You may want to keep it nice and slow for the first few days, maybe just sitting with your horse and talking to him. You could show him his grooming supplies and tack so they're not so scary as they could be when you first bring them out. It's also the perfect time to name/rename him if you want, because his personality will eventually start to show.
 Gather all his equipment, you should have already bought the grooming products, appropriate tack, feed, hay etc. Groom him, give him a wash if it's a nice, warm day. Take time to make him look really beautiful for his first proper day between you two, as this is the day where your horse will probably start trusting you and making a good bond. It is recommended staying there all day until he's turned out or stabled for the night so you're around him as much as possible, however don't neglect your other responsibilities and forget about the horse!

, When it's time to start riding, find a riding teacher/instructor who will help you two get to know each other. Ask him/her for recommendations on what you should do as a starter.
 Give him a break, and with the head-collar and lead rope go for a walk. It's a really great way to create a bond and a good way to explore new places before taking to the saddle. Just remember your mobile (on silent!) and possibly a map: don't get lost!

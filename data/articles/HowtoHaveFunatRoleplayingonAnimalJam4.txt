 Adoption centers, found in the pillow room, which is right next to the sol arcade, will be full! Usually bunnies are the most common animal up for adoption.
 After adopting, make sure always to love your animal jam baby, they always need your attention! Check out Love Your Animal Jam Baby for more info about roleplaying the adoption.
 For moms: dress in any colour designer skirt, camo boots to match your skirt, and a head flower in the same colour (or diamond earrings, tiara, etc). Then, turn your first colour to the same colour you picked for your skirt, head item, and shoes. Make your second colour white and your third colour black (for foxes use the first pattern that's specially made for foxes, for wolves use the dog pattern, and for any other animal use hearts).

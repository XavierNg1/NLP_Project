 Take a bit of time to analyze things, breaking them down into their basic parts. Learn to see through the clutter, and to reduce and draw the essential. Once you've trained yourself to do this, you will be able to draw anything.
 Drawing upside down helps you unlearn drawing what you think you see. Instead, you draw what you actually see. The easiest way to draw upside down is if you are drawing from a photo: simply invert the photo and go from there.


Alternatively, if you're working from a reference sketch, you can invert the reference sketch., This helps you because it doesn't give you time to bother about detail. Sketch as much as possible.


Practice making quick sketches when you're out and about in the world (at the zoo, on the bus, in the park, etc.). This can help you get at the most basic elements of your object and makes useful reference material that you may develop later., Get into the habit of visually analyzing your surroundings, even when you don't have pencil and paper available. Imagine breaking things down into their most essential shapes. You might end up seeing the world in a whole new way.

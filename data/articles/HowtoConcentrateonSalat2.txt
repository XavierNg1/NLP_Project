 Stand upright with a softened heart. Think of your prayer as your last prayer, as how one hadeeth says. Believe that Allah is by your side. Be as quiet and still as possible and try not to fidget. Keep your eyes open and look down straight to where your head will be when you prostrate (sujood)

, Perform every part of your prayer with care and in a relaxed manner, as what one hadeeth would say, "Hastiness is from Satan."

,,,, Recite Ta'uz (Refuge to Allah from Satan):A'udhubillahiminash shaitaan nirrajim.

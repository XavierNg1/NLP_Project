 Add the oil to your skillet and heat over medium heat for a couple of minutes.


Allow the oil to get hot, but do not bring it up to its smoking point. When the oil glides around the pan even more easily than it does at room temperature, it is ready to use.
 Add the chopped onion to the hot oil and cook, stirring constantly, until it becomes soft.


The onion can begin to turn translucent, but do not allow it to brown or burn.
 Add the garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, paprika, and salt to the onion. Stir well to coat evenly.
 Add both tomato products, undrained, to the skillet and stir well to combine.


Use your spatula or a wooden mixing spoon to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of your pan at this point.
 Let this mixture simmer for a few minutes while the flavors combine.


Stir occasionally. Do not cover.
 Transfer the tomato and onion mixture to the slow cooker and stir in the canned beans until evenly distributed. Stick the bay leaf into the mixture toward the center.


Make sure that the beans are drained and rinsed before you add them.
 Cover the slow cooker and let the chili beans cook until very tender.


Keep the slow cooker covered for the entire process. Do not uncover the slow cooker to stir the beans while they cook.
The chili beans can also be cooked on high for 2 to 3 hours.
 Use a wooden spoon to mash one-third to one-half of the beans. Stir well.


Doing this will create a thicker consistency, but it is not necessary if you prefer a thinner broth.
 These chili beans can be enjoyed as a main dish or as a side. You can also add cooked meat to them to create a traditional chili.

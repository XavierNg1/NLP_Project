 If you placed your iPhone in recovery mode willingly, you'll be able to hard-restart it like usual; to do so, however, the phone must not be connected to a computer.;
, The Lock button is either on the right side of the iPhone's casing (iPhone 6 and up) or on the top of the iPhone's casing (iPhone 5S and down), while the Home button is below the iPhone's screen.


If you're using an iPhone 7, hold down the Volume Down button instead of the Home button.
 You'll need to keep holding down the Lock button.
 Once you see the white Apple icon on your iPhone's screen, you can release the button and wait for the iPhone to finish rebooting. Your iPhone shouldn't be stuck in recovery mode anymore.

 If there is a concave line between two notes (it bends downward), then you want to hold the notes




, This is known as "legato," where every note is slightly blended together. Use hammer-ons and pull-offs to glide between these notes as seamlessly as possible.
 These come at the end of a measure. The normal vertical bar is bolded, with a colon (:) right before it. This means you go back to the last time you saw this symbol and repeat the playing until you get back again.
 Do you play the A on the fifth string or the second? Guitar tab will have a helpful number circled above the note telling you which string to play on.
 If there is a small number next to the note, it is telling you to use a specific finger. Your first finger is your index finger, your fourth is your pinky.
 There a lot more notes out there that, while less common in guitar music, are worth knowing. The first thing that you should explore are different notes -- from sixteenth notes down the eighth note rests.

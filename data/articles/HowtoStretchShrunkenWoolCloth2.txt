 Mix 1 part white vinegar and 2 parts water in a clean bucket or sink. Make sure that there is enough liquid to completely cover the shrunken wool item., Put the shrunken wool in the vinegar and water bath and mix the water around to agitate it. Then let the wool soak for about 25 minutes., After 25 minutes, take the wool item out of the bath and squeeze it gently to release excess water. Press it with a clean, dry towel to absorb more water., Use your hands to stretch small sections of the shrunken wool until you have stretched the whole garment. Finish by stretching the garment top to bottom and side to side until it is back to its original dimensions., Once the wool is back to its original size, air dry the wool item by hanging it up on a drying rack. After drying, your wool garment or cloth will be as good as new.

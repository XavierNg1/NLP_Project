 The pattern of a major scales is whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step,whole step, and half step. The F major scale notes are F, G, A, B-flat, C, D, E, then F again. You can play this as two octaves, but start with the first octave, the lower one.;
, On your right hand, put down your pinky and your index finger.
, The same as G except that your third finger on your left hand is up as well.
 Index and thumb down on your left hand and index and pinky down on your right. Make sure that your left thumb is on the lever closest to your right hand. You don't use the other one much, only in specific circumstances.
, Make sure your first finger is up for D because it only sounds barely different with it down, but it does change the pitch.
, The fingering is the same, but streamline the air a little more and blow it faster over the mouthpiece.
 The notes are the same as above, just you play them one octave up. Most of them have the same fingering but a few of them are different. If it is the same, the step will mention "look above", in reference to the first part above.Â The F that you start with is the same one that ended the last scale in Part 1.
 Look above.
 This is also the same fingering. Look above.
 This is the same, look above.
, It can be made using the aforementioned fingering for D but it is hard to do and almost never in tune.
 The fingering is the first two fingers and thumb on your left hand and the first two fingers on your right hand and no pinky.
 Like the D, you can play this as a normal F but it is easier to do with this finger up, and typically more in tune.

 It may be a fun thing to do at the time, because there's a whole other group of people doing it, but most of the time it comes back to haunt you. The person will find out and if it's a friend of yours, it can cause a fight.;
, There's no reason to be mean to others, even if they start something with you first. It'll keep everything more peaceful and calm that way.
 For example, if your friend is having troubles at home, and they need to get out of the house and just talk, maybe you can stop what you're doing (if you're doing something that isn't too important) and go help your friend. People will think of you as a better person, and won't really have a reason to be mad at you.
 Of course your friend is going to find out, from another so called friend, and they are going to confront you about this, this can lead to a lot of things, like people turning against you, and your secrets being told.
 There's no reason for you to get into the middle of someone else's fight. Let them work it out on their own. Because whenever people do this, even if it's just to help a friend, you usually get dragged into it and end up having people turned against you in one way or another (this doesn't apply to putting others before yourself, in some situations you really can't).
,", be truthful. Honesty is the first requirement in friendship, and if you don't have that in a friendship, you're not getting yourself into a good situation.

 Eating healthy, nutritious food helps boost your familyâ€™s immune system. This can help them be more able to fight off germs they come into contact with. A weak immune system from unhealthy eating can make your child more prone to getting sick.Make sure your child eats nutritious foods. This includes adding fruits, vegetables, and lean protein to every meal. You should provide healthy snacks, like apples and peanut butter, grapes and low fat cheese, or trail mix made with raisins, nuts, and dark chocolate. Get rid of sugary and junk food, like french fries and fried meats, cakes, cookies, donut, white pasta, and white bread.
 In addition to a healthy balanced diet, you may want to give your child foods or supplements that support immune system health. Feed your child foods full of vitamin C, zinc, and vitamin D. You can also give your child probiotics.Vitamin C can be found in apples, pineapple, citrus fruit, asparagus, broccoli, strawberries, spinach, leafy greens, and tomatoes.Good sources of zinc include seafood like crab and lobster, grassfed beef, pork chops, chicken, pumpkin seeds, spinach, nuts, chickpeas, dark chocolate, and white mushrooms. Many fortified foods also have zinc.Vitamin D can be found in food sources like fish, eggs, and cheese. Fortified dairy and grain products also contain vitamin D. The best source of vitamin D is 15 minutes of sunshine.
Talk to your pediatrician before giving any supplements to your child.
 Proper rest also helps support a strong immune system. By making sure your child gets plenty of sleep each night, you are helping to make their immune system strong so it can protect against germs.Toddlers need roughly nine to 14 hours, preschoolers need eight to 13 hours, and school-aged children need eight to 11.

 Half a cup to a cup of washing soda depending on how much water you're using should work.The washing soda and hot water acts a dissolving agent that melts the sticker's glue to break its bond from the glass surface.


Use gloves when handling washing soda as it can cause skin irritation. Washing soda binds better with hard water, or water with many minerals dissolved in it, to create a more abrasive foam than baking soda and washing detergent to better clean surfaces and clothing., You can soak it even longer or overnight for more stubborn stickers.
 Since washing soda is a much stronger alkaline than baking soda, the sticker should slide off the glass surface or be very easy to lift off.


Remember to rinse the object thoroughly after soaking it in washing soda, especially if it is an objected used to consume food like a jar or glass cup.

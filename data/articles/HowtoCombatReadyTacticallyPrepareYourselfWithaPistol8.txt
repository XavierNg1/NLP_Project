 Your firing hand moves up above your pistol grip and back down on it to get a good firing grip on the gun (while in the holster). Release any retention system you may have.
 Notice the finger is OFF the trigger. DO NOT put your finger on the trigger until the barrel is parallel to the floor.
 This gets the pistol pointed down range at your target. Disengage any safety you have. From this position you are able to shoot a very close target (0-2 yards), or threatening to shoot, while keeping your weapon away from your assailant's reach., When the gun passes your stomach, move your support hand toward the gun and in front of your firing hand in order to acquire a good firing grip., Keep your support elbow low (straight down is best)., This creates "isometric pressure" which controls the muzzle flip and felt recoil of the gun., Pull back to close contact position 3, place your hand on your stomach, safety on, rotate your wrist and raise your elbow, push gun straight down into the holster, and secure it. As mentioned before, a tactical reload before you re-holster is an excellent choice and habit to get into (read above to find out how to do a tactical reload).,), about 500 to 1000 times (no joke â€” that is about how long it takes for the process to become a procedural muscle memory), you will find you can draw extremely fast. Start practicing drawing and shooting a target (if you have access to a range).

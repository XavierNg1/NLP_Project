 Pour 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water into a small saucepan and bring it to a boil over high heat to make a simple syrup. Stir the mixture as it boils, and keep cooking until the sugar dissolves into the water. It should take about three minutes. Remove the mixture from heat and allow it to cool completely.If you don't want to make your own syrup, it's available for purchase wherever liquor is sold; just look for the section where mixers are stocked.
Or you can just mix a cup of sugar and a cup of water; the drink won't be as smooth, but it will taste still taste good.
 Pour the syrup into a large bowl and mix it with fresh lime and lemon juice.
 Jamaican punch typically contains strawberry syrup, lending this cocktail a bright fruity flavor and classic red hue. In place of strawberry syrup, you can use cherry syrup or another flavor that's red in appearance.
 Mix in the Jamaican white rum (or spiced rum, if you'd prefer). Add more or less rum according to your preference.
 Start by adding five cups of water, then give the mixture a taste. You can drink it as is or add the last cup of water to dilute it a bit.
 Either way is acceptable. This type of punch is not normally served in a large punch bowl, but instead in individual cocktail glasses. Garnish the punch with a pineapple ring or a cherry.

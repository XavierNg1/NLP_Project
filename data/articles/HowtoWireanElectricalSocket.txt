Turn off the power to the socket.
Unscrew the face plate and make a note of the wire connections to the earth, neutral and live terminals.
Unscrew the back box from the wall.
Place the new double back box on the wall over the top of the existing hole.
Use a spirit level to check itâ€™s straight and draw around the edge.;
, Drill a series of closely-spaced holes with the masonry bit to enlarge the hole for the double back box. Use a cold chisel and hammer to break the rest of masonry away to form a neat hole for the socket. If you have plasterboard walls, you can use a plasterboard saw to enlarge the hole.
 Check that the back box fits into the hole.


Tap out the round inlet holes in the box and thread the wiring through the box.
Fit rubber grommets around the holes in metal back boxes to protect the wires.
Mark, drill, and plug the fixing holes.
 If you are working on a ring circuit, twist together the wires for each terminal (live, neutral and earth), push them into the terminals and screw tightly in place with an electrical screwdriver.


If any of the bare wire ends are damaged, snip off the end and use the wire strippers to remove around 20mm of the sheathing.
Fold the bare wire back on itself and pinch together with pliers.
Twist together all the wires for a particular terminal and screw down tightly.
 Push the face plate against the back box, checking none of the wires are caught or stretched.


Fix the face place with the two long screws that are clipped to the inside of the late.
Fill any cracks or holes around the socket with filler and paint. Turn on the power supply.
 If not, turn off the power and re-check the wiring, sometimes a terminal screw can work loose. Call in an electrician to check your work if there is a problem.

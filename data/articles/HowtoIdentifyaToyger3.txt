 If you want to adopt a cat from a breeder, make sure to find a reputable breeder. Toygers are extremely rare because they are a designer cat breed. There are only approximately 400 Toygers in the world. This means Toygers can be quite expensive.Since not all Toygers have the same number of characteristics, the prices vary. Pet Toygers can range from $500 to $2000, while ones that are worthy to be show cats can range from $1500 to $5000. Many pet-worthy Toygers may not have all the physical markers for a show cat, but will have the personality.
Start by checking cat breed websites, such as The Fanciers Breeder Referral List, and The International Cat Association.
If you find a breeder who sells Toygers at a super cheap price, this is a red flag. It may indicate a problem in the Toygerâ€™s breeding.
 Toygers are extremely rare, so you may not be able to find one at a shelter or rescue. You can always check with local shelters and rescues, or talk to your vet or local experts who may know of a Toyger who needs rescuing.Try pet adoption websites. You may be able to find one through one of those.
 Finding a Toyger cat may take time. If you are interested in getting a cat from a breeder, be aware that they are very rare and there is a limited supply. There may be a waiting list for the cat, or the price may be more than you are willing to pay for a cat.

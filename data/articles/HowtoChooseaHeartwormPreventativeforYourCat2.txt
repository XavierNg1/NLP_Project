 These are the most common types of heartworm preventative. Oral pills can be crushed and put in your cat’s food, or otherwise fed to them.Since oral medications only need to be given monthly, the pills or tablets are not much of a hassle. Some even come in a chewable variety, with a meat or cheese flavor that the cat will enjoy.


Oral pills and tablets are available by prescription only, and may contain ivermectin or milbemycin oxime.
 The second type of popular and effective heartworm preventative for cats is a topical liquid, which you apply to the cat’s skin on the back of its neck. Topical liquids have the added benefit of also killing off fleas. However, some cats may not like the feeling of the liquid on their neck, and may try to rub the liquid off on furniture or the carpet.These topical liquids can be harmful to cats if ingested, so you may need to watch your cat after the liquid has been applied to make sure it doesn't lick up any liquid that it has rubbed off itself.
Topical preventatives are also only available by prescription. They commonly contain the drugs selamectin or moxidectin.
 Although this treatment—which protects pets against heartworm for up to 6 months at a time—is often used to treat dogs, it should not be used with cats. Heartworm treatment and prevention works differently between the two breeds, and the injectable treatment, while it can benefit dogs, should not be used on cats.Injectable heartworm preventatives commonly contain the drug moxidectin, also used in topical liquids. Nevertheless, these injectable preventative treatments are not safe to cats.

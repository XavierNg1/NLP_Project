 Character clowns are simply clowns that look like exaggerated versions of people, stereotypes, or emotions. For example, the classic "sad clown" look is a type of character clown. You could also be a perplexed clown, an angry clown, a doctor clown, or a sexy clown - you get the picture.
 Spread a thin layer of white base makeup on your face. Use the makeup sponge to evenly distribute the white base makeup to all areas of your face, covering your eyebrows as well. Most clowns will stop the application of the base makeup at their hairline, slightly below the jaw line and right in front of the earlobes.


Even out inconsistencies in the base makeup. Take a closer look at your base makeup and retouch any areas that have more or less makeup on them by patting them with the makeup sponge.
Remember to set your base makeup using theatrical face powder and a powder puff.
 Based on the character you have chosen to become, apply different colors of makeup and makeup designs to areas of your face you want to highlight.


If you're going to be a sad clown, choose a color to outline a frown around your mouth and down to your chin. Sad clowns often have black paint on the bottom half of their face, around the mouth, to indicate that they are unshaven.
If you want to be a perplexed clown, draw a thick, cocked eyebrow on your forehead, and a regular eyebrow on the other side.
To be a sexy clown, draw exaggerated black eyelashes above and blow your eyes, and use red to make large, luscious lips.
 Patting the powder puff on each different colored area will ensure the colors won't run together.
 Double check your clown makeup to make sure the lines are sharp and the colors aren't bleeding into the surrounding makeup.

 Heat increases blood flow to cramping muscles and can be a strong, relaxing pain reliever. If you have access to a microwave, in a work break room for example, dampen some paper towels and heat them in 30-second increments in the microwave until they are warm but not steaming. Take them to the bathroom and apply to your lower back for some soothing pain relief.


If you don’t want to risk making your clothes damp, it may be helpful to sit on the toilet. This way you can apply the heated paper towels to your lower back with your pants or skirt lowered.
If you don’t have access to a microwave, you can still employ heat to soothe your cramps. Run some paper towels under hot water in the bathroom. Wring them well and place on your abdomen or lower back to soothe your cramping.
 Exercise produces endorphins, which are your body’s natural pain relievers. Since you likely can’t put in a treadmill session on the go, try to incorporate easy exercise into your work or school day to boost your endorphins and provide some natural cramping relief. You could take the stairs instead of the elevator or walk outside during a free period., Caffeine constricts blood vessels and can increase muscle cramps. Steer clear of high-caffeine beverages if you’re experiencing menstrual pain. The soothing warmth of a decaf herbal tea is a better alternative to aid hydration and relieve discomfort.

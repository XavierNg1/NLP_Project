 If you're taking a series of model photos, strike a lot of different poses. Experimenting with different photos can help you find your best angles. If you plan on modeling professionally, you also want to have nice photos of you from a variety of angles. This allows a potential agent or employer to get a sense of your range.
 Modeling is like any other craft. You can learn a lot by studying what came before you. Look through magazines ads, websites, and other places where you're likely to find models posing.


Study their expressions. It can be hard to figure out how to do a model look, but watch how professional models hold their eyes and mouth. See if you can try and match that expression.Look at models you admire. If you're not a fan of a particular model's aesthetic, it'll be hard for you to follow in that person's footsteps. Just like a writer whose idol is William Faulkner wouldn't try to imitate Hemingway, you shouldn't strive to emulate a model whose taste you dislike. Find models you find personally inspiring and try to learn from them.
 If you feel nervous during a modeling shoot, this apprehension may show up in photographs. Strive to stay relaxed throughout the shoot. Your pictures will turn out more natural.


Try to breathe slowly and deeply. This can help your body slow down and stay calm.Take breaks as necessary. If you feel yourself getting agitated, stop for 10 minutes and take a short walk to relax.

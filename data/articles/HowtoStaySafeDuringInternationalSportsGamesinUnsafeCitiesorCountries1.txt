 When the news stories start coming in that there is unrest, strife, increased crime, or terrorist attempts taking place where the sports event is happening, it's time to sit up and listen. Keep a watching brief on events as they unfold. Do additional research online, looking at news sites from your own country and from the country or region you'll be traveling to. From this information, consider what your gut reactions are about what is happening. Maybe if it doesn't feel right already, it's a good idea to stay home.;
, Go to your government's foreign affairs site and look up the travel advisories provided by the foreign affairs' officials. If they are suggesting no travel, or extremely limited travel, then the situation is very serious and it's likely that they have more information than the news stories you've been watching.
 Another good indication of whether or not it's a safe bet to still attend is to see how the sports teams or individuals have responded to the crisis. Has their government or sports body decided to prevent them from traveling? Not only does that provide you with a big disincentive if your own country's team pulls out but it's also an indication that you're best at home too. If those responsible for the sports team individual's safety don't feel they can secure this, then this is highly indicative of the possible dangers involved.


Be careful to read between the lines, all the same. Sometimes countries or officials play brinkmanship diplomacy and end up going at the last minute after certain demands or assurances are met that don't always relate to the security situation. Keep a close eye on both the news and your government's travel advisories.

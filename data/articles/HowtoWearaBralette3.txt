 Use the bralette as your shirt under the sweater. This is a good way to completely cover up but show off a little bit of your cute bralette. You can choose how see-through you’d like your sweater to be. A sweater with fairly large holes is a good option to reduce the amount of skin showing, but reveal a bit of the bralette.Put on a long, semi-sheer sweater with black pants and black boots for a day or night look.
 You can show off a little bit of the bralette while staying modest. Wear a V-neck sweater or shirt that doesn’t come down very far, but does reveal some of your chest. Make sure the top is low enough so that it would show the top of your bralette.Choose a bralette that is trimmed in lace. Wear a V-neck shirt that shows only the trim of the bralette.
 This works best with a long-sleeved shirt or sweater. The shirt should be fairly loose on you, and allow the shirt to fall off one shoulder so that it reveals the strap of your bralette.Wear a cotton sweater with the sleeves rolled up. Pair the sweater with white pants and sandals for a day out.
 This is a great option because you can control how much skin you want to show. You can unbutton one or two buttons to show only the trim of your bra. Or unbutton the shirt enough so the top of the bralette shows.Wear the bralette with white button-down shirt, black slacks, and brightly colored stilettos or ballerina flats for a night out.

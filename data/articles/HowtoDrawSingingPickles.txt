 Try to make your ovals pickle-like. Draw more, or less than three if you wish. There is no perfect number of singing pickles. Depict as many as you like.;
, Draw the eyes in proportion to the ovals. Eyes give character. Try to make the eyes in your singing pickles express whatever you believe are the typical emotions of a singing pickle.
 Make the mouths open if you like to indicate your pickles are in mid-song., Draw some typical pickle lumps and bumps. Color your pickles green. Remember cauliflower, onions, beetroot and other vegetables can be pickled so you don't have to color them green like gherkins, or even draw them that shape.

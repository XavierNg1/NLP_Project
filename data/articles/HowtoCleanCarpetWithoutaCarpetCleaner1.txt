 Do not let stains sit on the carpet for a long period of time. Clean up stains right away so the stain doesn't absorb into the carpet fibers. Stains that sit on the carpet can also end up leaking into the bottom of the carpet, causing mildew and odor.If you know people are going to eat or drink around the carpet, have cleaning materials on hand in the event of spills and stains.;
, If a liquid like blood gets on the carpet, use water to get the stain out. Wet a damp clean cloth and blot the stain out. Do not scrub or rub hard on the stain, as this can make it worse and damage the carpet.Once you have blotted away the blood, use clean paper towels to dry the area. Lay a hard object over the paper towels to soak up any remaining water.
 Another good spot cleaner is club soda. If someone spills a glass of wine or juice on your carpet, bust out the club soda. Pour a small amount on the stain and use a dry cloth to blot the area until the stain comes out. Do not scrub the stain, as this can ruin the fibers in the carpet.Only use a small amount of club soda at a time. Flooding the area with club soda or using too much of it can cause mildew to build up in the pad of the carpet.
 If pen ink gets on the carpet, try applying a small amount of milk and cornstarch to the stain. Mix a small amount of milk and cornstarch in a bowl to form a paste. Then, apply the paste to the stain. Use a dry toothbrush to gently brush the paste off the stain. The paste should pick up the ink stain and remove it.Make sure you vacuum up the scraped off paste. You should see a stain free carpet underneath.

 If the wool has any rust inhibitors or soaps on it, it will interfere with your results. You should also look for a steel wool with thin fibers. This will make it easier for the fibers to ignite and burn., You will not be able to hold the steel wool in your hand. It will be on fire! You also do not want to burn anything down. Glass plates or tin lids are great choices., Touching a 9-V battery to the steel wool will connect the positive and negative leads of the battery. This closes the circuit and allows electricity to flow. The steel wool will ignite because more current is flowing through than it can handle, so it heats up until it reaches an ignition point., Black rust is formed as a result of oxidation in an oxygen deprived environment. Since the steel wool is oxidized so rapidly in this reaction there is little time for enough oxygen to access the iron to form iron (III) oxide (red rust).

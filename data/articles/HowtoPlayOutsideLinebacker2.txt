 The weak-side linebacker (commonly referred to as Will) is not by any means a weaker player, simply playing from the less-covered side without having to worry about the tight end. A running back who has been handed the ball may often cut to the weaker side of the formation depending on the play, in which case it is the Will’s job to tackle and halt progress of the ball.


Wills are often a bit lighter and faster than strong-side outside linebackers and middle linebackers. While the other two are akin to hammers pounding the lead and secondary blockers, the Will’s job is to penetrate and make a play on the ball., Many plays may call for a running back or fullback to come out of the backfield to act as an outlet receiver in the event that a quarterback senses trouble before being able to complete a longer pass. In these cases, it’s the Will’s job to cover the back to prevent a pass or at least tackle the back immediately after the pass is completed.
 Because it’s the Will’s job to exploit holes created by the rest of the defensive line to attack the ball, weak-side outside linebackers make their fair share of quarterback sacks.

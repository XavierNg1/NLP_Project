 This is a fun, unconventional way to add a bandana to your outfit. You can tie it as an ascot wrap to accessorize.
 Take two opposing corners and hold one in each hand. Pull the bandana tight and place it around the back of your neck with the ends hanging in the front.
 Fold one end over the opposite end twice. On the last fold, bring the end up through the loop at your neck. Take both hands to loosen the wrap at the front of your neck. Also, loosen the end that you pulled through your loop to create your ascot look.

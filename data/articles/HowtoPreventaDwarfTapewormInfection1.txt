 Because dwarf tapeworm eggs are transmitted through human and animal feces, you should try to avoid contact with fecal matter as much as possible. This is especially important for those working in fields, such as healthcare, child care, or waste management, where exposure to human waste is a possibility.;
, If you work with, or own livestock or pet animals (especially rats, or other mammals such as dogs), ensure that they are treated with de-worming medication so that they cannot become infected and pass tapeworm eggs along to you. , Tapeworm eggs are transmitted through their hosts' fecal matter, so proper disposal will help ensure that any existing tapeworm infections are not spread.
 If you do come into contact with your own, or others', feces (when working with livestock, changing an infant's diaper, using the toilet, etc.), immediately wash your hands with antibacterial soap and running water for at least 60 seconds to ensure that no tapeworm eggs survive to accidentally be ingested by you later on. If soap and water isn't available to you, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer can be used. Always wash your hands before preparing food.


Frequently washing your hands not only prevents you from accidentally ingesting, and becoming infected by, tapeworm eggs; it also ensures that, even if you've already become infected, you won't pass on the infection to others, or re-infect yourself.

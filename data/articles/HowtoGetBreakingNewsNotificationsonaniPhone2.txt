 If you’ve already begun using the News app, this method will help you change which breaking news notifications you receive.
 It’s at the bottom of the screen below the news headlines.


If you see a button that says “Next” instead of news headlines, use Setting up News Notifications for the First Time.
 It’s at the top left corner of the screen.
 Use the switches to enable or disable breaking news notifications for that source.


Slide a switch to the On (green) position to receive notifications from that source.
Slide a switch to the the Off (gray) position to turn off notifications from that source.
 When one of your selected sources releases a breaking story, you’ll see a notification at the top of your screen. If you disabled any sources, you will no longer receive notifications from those sources.

 ---It's about 150 gold for 1 iron ore (this amount will change), and about 350 gold for an iron bar (this, like before, will change through the fluctuations in the Grand Exchange). Keep in mind that the success rate for iron smelting is only a mere 50%, unless you manage to acquire a Ring of Forging (members only). All this means is that if you buy iron ore, and smelt it, you will theoretically get money from it.;
, ---This is one of the HARDER ways, unless you either have proper contacts (friends, power miners etc).
 ---It's advised that your combat level is at least enough to take on Lvl. 14 Scorpions (aggressive to anyone under Lvl. 29), and a couple of Lvl. 32 King Scorpions (aggressive to anyone under Lvl. 69). It's fine if you just run past them, but beware, King Scorpions can hit UP TO 4, so be careful, or bring food. Oh, and you need 15 mining at least (obviously)

, ---Flesh Crawlers (can be Lvl. 28, 35, or even 41!) are known to drop iron ore quite often.

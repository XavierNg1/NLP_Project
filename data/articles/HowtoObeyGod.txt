 No one is righteous before God Romans 3:10-18 and even our "righteous deeds" are like filthy rags before God Isaiah 64:6. Therefore, at this point, all hopes of YOU obeying God should now be crushed.;
, The question you will be wise to ask is why can't anyone obey God? The reason is Genesis 3. Read the whole thing. Then read Romans 5:12-21. Basically, our first parents, Adam and Eve rebelled against God and all creation was cursed as a result, and also as a consequence, we inherited a sinful nature which hates God, hates His commandments and weirdly tries to impress God by scantily obeying His commands.
 God is going to punish ALL sinners, which includes you and me. However, the definition of sinner is one who doesn't obey God's commandments. However you know you should because God will punish sinners... Please stay and read step 4

, This person is Jesus Christ, who is God (Isaiah 9:6-7). He is our Savior! He died for all sins, all the SINS of every single human who has ever lived and is living and will live! 1 John 2:1-2 And He did this willingly because God loves us (John 10:17-18 and Romans 5: 6-11)
, Being just, all sin has to be punished and punishment taken by the sinner or Jesus Christ who willingly chose to atone for ALL sins. Therefore, you receive this gift by believing in Jesus Christ as your Savior and submitting to Him as your Lord. This is a gift from God and even believing is a gift from God. All who believe in Jesus for the forgiveness of their sin will be saved (John 3:16) but all who disbelieve are condemned already (John 3:36)

, In the past, it was easier to do sinful things, conversely, when God changes your heart, it comes naturally to do good things.

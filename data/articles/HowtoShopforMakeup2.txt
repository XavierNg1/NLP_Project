 Drugstores have a good supply of foundation, but what they don’t offer is a way to try on the product. Foundation needs to match your skin perfectly, so it’s important that you try it on at a store that offers tester strips, like MAC or Sephora.Look for foundations with built-in sun protection, so you don’t have to apply yours separately.
If you have to shop at a drugstore, look for a foundation in a neutral tone. Avoid anything with overtones of other colors (yellow, peach, pink, copper, etc).
If you have bad skin, splurge on the best foundation you can afford. The higher quality will help even out your skin tone without aggravating your acne.
 The biggest mistake people make when shopping for lipstick is only considering color. Choosing a lipstick that works with the color of your skin is important, but it’s not the only factor that counts.Walk around the store and see how the color holds up over time.
Consider how easy or difficult the lipstick is to apply. If it’s hard to apply, you won’t wear it often.
Think about if the lipstick feels good on your lips. If it’s too dry, it won’t be comfortable.
For a natural lipstick color, choose a color that either matches or is slightly darker than your natural lip shade.
 Concealer is meant to conceal small areas, not to be used as an all-over foundation. If you’re just evening out a few small blemishes, look for a concealer with light coverage.If you have dry skin, steer clear of liquid concealers.
If you have oily skin or enlarged pores, avoid stick concealers.
For dark circles, select a concealer with at least medium coverage.
 Different types of lashes require different treatments, so it’s important to match your mascara with your needs. If you have very straight lashes, you’ll also need to invest in an eyelash curler.If your lashes are short, look for a mascara with a lengthening formula.
If you have dry eyes, use a mascara with a wax-based formula.
Skip the waterproof mascara – it’s harder to remove.

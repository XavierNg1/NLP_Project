 This method of treating body odor on clothes is a spot treatment, so you should focus your work on specific areas. In most cases, the smell is usually coming from the underarm area of shirts or the crotch of pants.
 There are many commercial products that you can buy at the store but using a bit of your own laundry detergent may very well do the trick. You can also try mixing a paste of baking soda and water. Make it thick, but not so thick you can't spread it. Apply the paste onto the area where the odor is most pungent.
Some suggest crushing up uncoated aspirin and rubbing it onto the odorous areas of clothes. The salicylic acid in the aspirin should help eliminate body odor smells.
 Remember to keep your colors and types of fabric separate. A warmer wash cycle will probably help get the smells out more effectively but always remember to follow the wash instructions on the labels of your clothes.
 Try to avoid using the dryer if you are not sure whether the odor is gone. Dryers can lock in the odor, making it even harder to remove next time you was your clothes.

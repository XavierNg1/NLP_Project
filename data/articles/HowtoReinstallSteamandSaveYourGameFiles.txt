This method may make the reinstalling useless. Be sure that your problem isn't due to an individual game file, as you'll copy the bad file along if it's located in the folder you've copied.



First, delete your whole Steam folder (Right click, delete).
Open your favourite Web browser, and go to Steam's website.
On the upper-right corner of the screen, you'll see a button labeled "Install Steam". Click on it.
Click the green "Install Steam Now" button, and accept the download. It'll download the setup file for Steam. Once done, just launch the setup and follow the instructions.



Remember where you've pasted your game files (That "common" folder)? Copy that and paste it in the newly created "SteamApps" folder. Windows Explorer may ask if you want to overwrite some files. Just click yes, and you should be set!

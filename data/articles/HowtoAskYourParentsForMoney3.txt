 Once the money is in your pocket, you'll feel relief that you can pay for what you need. But don't forget to start saving money so you can pay your parents back if that was part of the bargain you struck with them. Keeping up your end will make your parents feel better about having loaned you money. In addition, you'll feel better when you are no longer beholden to them.
 While there's nothing wrong with asking your parents for money, it's not a situation you want to be in forever. Your parents need to save for retirement, and you need to feel independent and financially secure in your own right. Even if your parents say yes every time, take steps toward earning enough money to meet your own needs, so asking for money doesn't become a habit., Think about how it felt to ask your parents for money. Was it a positive or negative experience? If it was positive, you're lucky; you've got very supportive parents. However, in some cases there are drawbacks to asking parents for money. While parents might say yes when you ask, they may also cause you to feel guilty or childish for asking. Asking family members for money can be emotionally loaded. If you ever need extra money again, consider these other options:


If you're in school, see if you can take an on-campus job or get an emergency loan from the financial aid office.
If you have a job, see if you can get an advance on your paycheck to cover emergency bills.
If you're having trouble paying loans, meet with your bank to work out a sustainable payment plan based on your income.

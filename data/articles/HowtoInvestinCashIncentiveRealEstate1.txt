 Research on the Internet at sites that focus on real estate education or get books from your local library or bookstore. Money magazine and Forbes also contain useful articles. Get up to speed on what is for sale in your local real estate market and visit all properties in your target price range., For your first few deals, it would be to your advantage to partner with someone with experience in the real estate market and who has successfully "flipped" houses. (Flipping is buying a property in disrepair, fixing it up and then selling it for a profit.) Finding a mentor willing to advise you would also be invaluable.
 As the seller usually pays the listing and selling real estate agents, it will cost you nothing to work with a real estate broker experienced in finding properties that are offering cash incentives. Ask others experienced in real estate investing for a referral, and choose someone based on ability to understand the investor's needs, availability to show the homes, likability, and knowing the markets.


You can find details about a particular real estate brokers at the real estate company's website.
You should also interview several brokers, just like an employer would interview job applicants and choose the one that meets your needs and criteria. You can prescreen beforehand to find out if they work with investors, what kinds of real estate they specialize in, what kind of availability per week they have, and anything else that is important to you.

 If your toddler is acting aggressively, you should try to figure out where that behavior is happening. Make a mental list of where your child displays aggressive behavior. Does it happen in one setting or many settings?If the behavior is only happening in one place, like a store, try to figure out what triggers that behavior. There is something in the environment, like the noise, the amount of people, or even the lighting, that is causing the behavior.
 In addition to figuring out where it happens, think about when your toddler is aggressive. Certain times of the day or stressors may trigger aggressive behavior. Think about specific events that happen prior to the behavior. This may help you figure out what is causing the aggressive behavior.The behavior may happen when your child is tired, so right before nap time. It may happen during transition periods.
Your child may be aggressive right after someone does something they don't like, like you tell them to stop playing or someone takes something from them.
Being overstimulated is a common trigger for aggressive behavior or tantrums.
 There may be other reasons your child acts in an aggressive way. Maybe your child has experienced a major change that has upset them. The behavior may also be geared towards just one person or a group of people. Singling out the factors that are causing the aggression can help you deal with it.For example, your child may be upset because you just started back to work, their grandmother has moved away, or theyâ€™ve switched daycares. The child may be aggressive towards a particular person, like a person at daycare or a family member, or everyone.

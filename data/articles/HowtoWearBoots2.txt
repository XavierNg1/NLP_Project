 Choose ankle or knee-high boots like cowboy boots or riding boots to tuck pants or jeans into. Slouch boots are often roomier if you’re having trouble fitting your pants under boots. Wear skinny or narrow fit pants for this look.


To show off ankle boots with pants that are a little too long, roll the bottoms over once or twice to create a cuff. It’s okay to leave a little skin showing between pants and boots. Choose light-wash jeans for this look.
 Choose narrow, smooth boots without a lot of extra bulk like buckles or straps if you want to wear pants over them. Bootcut jeans and pants are made for this. They should be wide enough to easily fit over your boots, and skim the top of where your foot is.
 Stick with neutral color boots (black, brown, or gray) to wear them with any outfit. A good rule for both men and women is to match your boot color with your belt color, too, if you’re wearing one. In general, wear brown with brown and black with black.


For an evening look, pair heeled boots with a super skinny pant and shiny top.
If you want to wear a bright statement boot, pair it with more muted color clothing.
Try out motorcycle boots paired with black pants and a leather jacket for an edgier look, or combat boots with jeans, a loose plaid shirt, and a beanie for a grunge look.

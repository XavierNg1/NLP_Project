 Place one cup (240 ml) of water in a stovetop or electric kettle, then heat until the water begins to boil. Take the water off the heat, pour the water into a mug, then add a teabag of black tea.Traditionally, chai is made with Assam or Darjeeling tea, but any kind of strong black tea, including Earl Gray, would work. You can also use tea leaves if you wish.
 Soak the teabag or tealeaves in the water for 3-5 minutes, then remove them. Steeping black tea for longer than 5 minutes gives the tea a bitter taste., After you tea has seeped and you have removed the tealeaves or tea bag, add in 1 Â½ tablespoons (22.18 ml) of the milk and sugar chai mix./chai-tea-mix-recipe/, Stir the chai mix into the black tea until all clumps of the mix have fully dissolved in the tea. Taste the tea and add more chai mix if you want a stronger flavor. Then enjoy your spiced chai while hot!

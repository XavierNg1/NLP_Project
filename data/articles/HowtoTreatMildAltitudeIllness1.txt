 If you start to experience any symptoms of mild altitude sickness, such as a headache, lightheadedness, or lung pain, you should descend by at least 500m or 1,600 feet. This will give your body time to acclimatize to the altitude and relieve your symptoms.You should avoid attempting to go to higher altitudes for two to three days, or until your symptoms have disappeared. Severe altitude sickness can be fatal, so if you notice your symptoms getting worse, make sure you descend to a much lower height.
Signs of severe altitude sickness include confusion, drowsiness, convulsions, shortness of breath (even while at rest), clumsiness or difficulty walking, double vision, irrational behavior, a bubbling sound in the chest and/or coughing up a white or pink frothy liquid.;
, Once you have descended to a lower altitude, you should stay hydrated by drinking lots of water. Avoid drinking alcohol, as it can dehydrate you further.You should also avoid any smoking or inhaled products (including vaping) that are not medicine, as this can make it more difficult for you to breathe. It can also worsen your symptoms.
 Do not do any exercise or intense physical movements, as your body needs time to recover from altitude illness. You should rest for at least two to three days, or until your symptoms subside.Do not take sleeping pills to help you rest while you have altitude illness, as they can slow your breathing further and lead to complications.

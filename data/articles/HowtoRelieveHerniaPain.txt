 If you have an inguinal hernia (of the groin), you may want to wear a special support which can also reduce your pain. Talk with your doctor about wearing a truss which is like supportive underwear. Or, you might wear a support belt or harness that helps keep the hernia in place. To wear a support, lay down and wrap the belt or harness around the hernia to keep it snug.

Your doctor may recommend a surgical procedure where a surgeon operates to push the protruding muscle back into place.

 If you're experiencing heartburn from a hiatal hernia, put less pressure on your stomach. To do this, eat smaller portions of food in each sitting. You should also eat slowly so that your stomach digests food easier and faster. This can also reduce pressure on the stomach sphincter (LES), a muscle that is already weakened.Try to avoid eating 2 to 3 hours before going to bed. This will prevent food from putting pressure on your stomach muscles as you try to fall asleep.

Keep your hands at your sides and lift your knees off the ground and into the air. Using both legs, do a pedaling motion in the air. Keep doing this until you feel muscle strain in your abdomen.
Bring your knees up so that your legs are slightly bent. Place your hands on the back of your head and bend your torso up by about 30 degrees. Your torso should be closer to your knees. Hold this position and carefully recline. You can repeat this 15 times.
 If you're experiencing reflux, try to stop smoking. Smoking can increase your stomach acid, making the reflux worse. And, if you're planning on getting surgery to treat your hernia, your doctor will most likely advise you to quit smoking in the months leading up to the surgery.

This usually means taking 2 or 3 tablets every 4 to 6 hours.Be aware that licorice root can cause a lack of potassium in your body, which can lead to heart arrhythmias. Talk to your doctor if you take large quantities of licorice or use it for more than two weeks.
Slippery elm is another herbal supplement to try as a drink or tablet. It coats and soothes irritated tissues and is safe to use during pregnancy., If you have severe reflux, you might try drinking apple cider vinegar. Some believe that the extra acid will tell your body to reduce its own acid production in a process called feedback inhibition although more research is needed. Mix 1 tablespoon of organic apple cider vinegar to 6 ounces of water and drink it.If you like, you can also add a bit of honey to improve the flavor.


A variation of this approach is to make you own lemonade or limeade. Just mix a few teaspoons of pure lemon or lime juice and add water to taste. If you want, add a bit of honey to the drink. Drink this before, during and after meals.

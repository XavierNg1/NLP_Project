 Oral irrigators, such as water-picks, can be used to push tonsil stones out of their cavities.Test it out briefly on your tonsils before you buy itâ€”if the spray is too strong, and hurts in any way, don't use it to get out your stones.
 Place the irrigator inside the mouth but not touching the stone, and switch on the oral irrigator on the lowest setting. Direct the stream of water onto one visible tonsil stone, keeping it steady until the stone has been dislodged.
 If the irrigator is loosening the stones but not removing them, alternate using the pic and using a cotton swab or the back of your toothbrush.


Repeat steps for each visible tonsil stone. Remember to be gentle as you pressurize the stones away with the water.

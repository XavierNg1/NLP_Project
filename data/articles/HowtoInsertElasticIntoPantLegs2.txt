 To determine how much elastic to insert into your pant leg, try measuring the elastic around your ankle or around the ankle of the person who will wear the pants. This will help to ensure that your elastic pant leg hem will be a good fit. Wrap the elastic around the ankle without stretching it and then cut it about an inch past the area where the two ends meet.Keep in mind that you do not want to make your elastic bands too tight or too loose. Aim for a comfortable fit.
 As you work the elastic through the hem, make sure that the elastic does not get twisted. This could affect the look of your finished project.If the elastic does get twisted, then try to untwist it. If you cannot get it untwisted, then you may need to start over and try again.
 Using a larger safety pin may make your work go faster, but you cannot always use a large safety pin. The size of your casing will determine what size safety pin you can use. If you have wide casing, then you can go with a larger safety pin. If you have a small casing, then go with a small safety pin., Make sure that the safety pin does not open while you are working it through the casing. If it does, try to fasten it again without snagging the fabric. If you cannot get it fastened again, then pull the elastic out and start over.,

The Hobbit
The Fellowship of the Ring
The Two Towers
The Return of the King;
, Take notes--on paper or in your head--of the similarities and differences of the books and movies. Ask yourself why they may have left certain parts out or embellished upon an aspect of the story, such as Liv Tyler's character Arwen.
 This is an optional step since some people view it as creepy. It's up to you to decide if "merch" collecting is a big part of fandom.
 A forum is an excellent way to communicate with others about your feelings on a particular the book. Discuss them and try to get inside J.R.R. Tolkien's head as you read. If it helps, draw a simple map after reading through the book a second time. Try to follow Frodo's journey to rid the Middle Earth of "The One Ring".

 If the time comes that you need to use your kit, you don’t want to be rooting around in your attic or the back of a closet for it. Store it as close to the exit of your home as possible., If the emergency is a fire or something else that might bring rescue workers to your home, make sure you post a rescue alert sticker. These are available from the ASPCA and will notify the rescue workers that there are pets in the home., Ask someone you trust if they’d be willing to serve as an interim care giver in the event of an emergency. This allows your cat to be cared for, even if you end up in a shelter that does not accept animals. The person you ask should live close to you., It’s possible that the emergency you encounter will require you to stay in your home. In this case, you’ll need to choose a shelter-in-place room where both you and your cat will be comfortable. The room you choose should not have any windows (in case of strong winds) and should be near the interior of your home., Microchipping your cat can be expensive, but having a chip can help you locate your cat if they get lost during an emergency. You’d need to contact the chip company and ask them to track your cat.

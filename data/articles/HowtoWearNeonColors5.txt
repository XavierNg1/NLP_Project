 Neon makeup may sound scary, but combining a mostly nude face with a pop of color at the eyes or lips can make for a bold, modern look.


Combine bolder looks with subtler ones. Try bright lips with a pastel dress, or a neon cat eye with a dark blazer and crisp slacks.
If youâ€™re wearing neon makeup, keep your hairstyle simple. A classic ponytail or bun sweeps hair back while drawing attention to your face.
Balance your makeup. Bright saturated colors everywhere can make you seem overdone and garish. If you create a dramatic eye, be sure to combine it with a subtle or nude lip. Bright pink or red lips pop when paired with subtle, neutral eye makeup.
 Unexpected colors, designs, and embellishments (rhinestones anyone?) have worked their way into the mainstream. Neon polishes are everywhere! For an added twist, try a neon French manicure.

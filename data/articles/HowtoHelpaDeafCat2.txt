 Just like with any cat, you're going to have to tell your cat "no" sometimes, such as when it jumps somewhere it's not supposed to be. One way to do that with a deaf cat is to raise your arms above your head (to make yourself taller) and wave them as you approach the cat., Although most cats won't come every time you call them, you still want to teach your cat a visual cue for "come." When your cat is looking at you, hunch down on the floor, and create a hand signal, such as tapping the floor. Use a treat to entice it over. Reinforce this behavior until it gets the idea., Most cats respond to a being sprayed with a water bottle, and a deaf cat is no different in this regard. If the cat is on top of something you'd rather it not be, a quick spray from the bottle will encourage it to get down. Spraying a cat as you come in the door can also discourage door-darters.

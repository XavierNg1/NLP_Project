 Begin in the same way as in the Double Loop method. Use the Double Loop method for the first stitch, then begin using the Single Loop method. This technique is more advanced; it is trickier, but quicker once you're used to it. The red arrow shows what you will do in the current step. Your result should match the next image at the beginning of this step.The four parts of the cross are now Strands A, B, C, and D.
 Leave a loop. Hold it with one finger while you prepare to make the next fold. Take your time making the folds and loops, and make sure theyâ€™re nice and even.
 Fold Strand B (the one on the same side as Strand A) over Strand A. Hold it down with one finger.
 You can hold this fold down with the same finger you used for the second fold.
 Pull each strand tight. As with the Double Loop method, be sure to pull slowly and evenly to avoid twisting the strands, and to ensure an even, flat stitch.
 Strand A is now Strand C and Strand C is now Strand A. Repeat. You will be back at the beginning, only the pattern will be flipped.

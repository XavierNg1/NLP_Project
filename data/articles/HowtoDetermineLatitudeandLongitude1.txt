 Latitude measures how far a point is north or south of the equator. Since the earth is round, distance from the equator is measured in angular degrees with the equator being 0 degrees and the northernmost point -- the North Pole -- being at 90 degrees. The southernmost point -- the South Pole -- is also at 90 degrees.Latitude is measured in degrees north when in the northern hemisphere and degrees south when in the southern hemisphere.;
, Longitude measures how far a point is east or west of the prime meridian -- arbitrarily set as Greenwich, England. Since the Earth is round, distance from the prime meridian is measured in angular degrees with the prime meridian being at 0 degrees longitude. As you move east or west, the longitude measures up to 180 degrees of the prime meridian.180 degrees longitude is known as the international dateline.Longitude is given as degrees east when in the eastern hemisphere and west when in the western hemisphere., Degrees are a large unit of measurement so to get an accurate location, longitude and latitude are divided to the decimal point referred to as decimal degrees. For example, you may see latitude as 35.789 degrees North. Global Position Systems (GPS) often show decimal degrees but printed maps do not.Online topographic maps express longitude and latitude decimal degrees in degrees, minutes and seconds. Each degree equals 60 minutes, while each minute equals 60 seconds. The comparison to time allows for easier subdivision., First, always assume that the top of the map is north.The numbers on the right and left side of a map refer to the latitude. The numbers on the top and bottom of the map are the longitude.Remember how to convert time in order understand a map using decimal degrees as degrees, minutes, and seconds:

15 seconds = one quarter of a minute = 0.25 minutes
30 seconds = half a minute = 0.5 minutes
45 seconds = three quarters of a minute = 0.75 minutes

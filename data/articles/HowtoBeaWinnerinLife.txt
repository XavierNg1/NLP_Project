 The opposite of a winner is a loser. And someone who always sees the bad stuff that happens to them (and fails to appreciate the good stuff) is always losing.;
, How can you feel like you're losing at the game of life when you Live in the Moment and appreciate so much around you?

, You can't gain anything if you don't take risks.
 You`re not going to feel any better about yourself when you only think about your flaws. Try to find the good things out of a bad situation.

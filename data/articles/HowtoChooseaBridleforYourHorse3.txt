 It’s a good idea to put on the bridle before purchasing it to make sure it fits. Make sure your bridle is loose before attempting to put it on your horse. If it’s too tight, it will hurt the horse and you may meet more resistance.


Hold onto the halter or the horse’s mane to keep it restrained while putting on the bridle.Put the reins over the horse’s head. This will allow you to restrain the horse without using the halter.Position the crownpiece between the horse’s ears. Put your right arm around the horse’s neck and between the ears, holding the bridle by the crownpiece in your right hand. Then hold the bridle so that the bit is positioned over the mouth., With your right hand on the crownpiece, grab the bit with your left hand and move it towards the horse’s mouth. If your horse is well-trained, you should be able to just touch the horse’s lips to indicate that the mouth needs to open.If your horse doesn’t open his or her mouth, try putting your thumb and little finger behind the horse’s incisors to coax the mouth open without getting bitten.
Once the horse’s mouth is open, put in the bit.
 Once the bridle is on, you’ll have to adjust the throatlatch, noseband, and cheekpieces.For the noseband, make sure there is about two or three fingers’ width of slack. If the noseband is too tight the horse won’t be able to open its mouth.
If the throatlatch is too tight the horse won’t be able to breath. You should be able to fit three fingers between the horse’s throat and the strap.
The cheekpieces should be tight enough so that the bit is held firmly in place.

 The neatest border will consist of a simple half moon shape (semi circle). If you want a different shape than this, it will take more work and if there are jagged pieces involved, there is a risk of injury to garden users, people and pets alike.


If using rugged, already broken pieces, aim to place sharp points down into the soil, leaving only soft, non-sharp edges facing upward.
 You’ll need to know how much land you’ll be covering with the border to know how many plates to prepare for the border. Usually you'll get at least two pieces of the border from one plate if using the simple half moon shape.

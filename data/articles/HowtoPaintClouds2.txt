 The paint will dry about half as light as it first looks on the paper. So it should look a little brighter than is natural when you're first painting., Paint clean water across the paper, making it slightly damp., Gently paint in a light coating of yellow ocher near the bottom of the sky., Make it fairly dark. Paint across the top of the canvas with it., Add more water to your brush. Add more of the ultramarine. Paint underneath the top color, slightly overlapping. Make it lighter than the first layer., You want to create a fading effect towards the bottom layer. The bottom layer should be a mix of pale yellow and a light bit of blue, as you already painted the bottom yellow ocher., Wash the brush in the water, then dry it out on a paper towel., The dry brush will pick up the pigment and color from the page, leaving white areas for clouds. As you roll, you can curve the brush slightly to create the look of clouds., Between clouds, you will need to dry off the brush again. Otherwise, the brush will leave paint rather than absorbing it., Using a strong grey (such as a purely mix of red and ultramarine), brush it on the underside of one part of the cloud. Leave the other side in white to show where the light is hitting it., Watercolors dry quickly, so you must work fast to create this effect.

 Keep in mind that although colour can be provided by grout, it is best to allow the tile to provide the colour in mosaic designs. Most designers advise you to use grout that acts like a thin gray line in order to make tiles appear distinct without venturing on too boldly.


White grout can appear very harsh as it will draw the eye to the gaps rather than the coloured tiles. However, it can be a complement to lighter tones so it is very good for showing off pale mosaics. And when used with strong bright colours, it will produce a Mediterranean feel.
Grey grout enhances most coloured tesserae and has the most unifying effect of all the coloured grouts.
Dark grout unifies darker coloured tesserae and segregates lighter ones.
 Itâ€™s impossible to match a grout colour to the exact colour of a tile due to the variations of shading most tiles possess. Opt for a grout colour that is in the same colour family or blends with the tile. This is a common selection for people who wish for the focus to be on the entire floor versus the individual tile.
 Choosing a grout colour that contrasts your tile focuses your eye to see the tile as an individual instead of an entire picture, as you would with blending grout colours. This is great for people who want a black and white pattern or checkerboard effect on their floors.


For example, gray grout should not be used with a gray tile. Use a red-brown terra cotta grout for gray tile instead.Avoid matching colours and gravitate towards contrasting colours.
 Accent colours are used by people who want to compliment an accent colour they might be using in their overall design scheme. If you go with this option, understand that if you ever are to change your design theme later down on the road, you might have to change the grout colour you used initially as well.

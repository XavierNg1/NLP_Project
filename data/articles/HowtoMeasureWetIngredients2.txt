 Some sweeteners, like honey and molasses, are reluctant to leave the measuring cup once they’re there. (The good news is that they’re easier to eyeball--they are too thick to have a meniscus.) To encourage these syrups to slip out more easily, pour them into a liquid measuring cup that has been sprayed with cooking oil.To save even more time, in recipes in which you are measuring both oil and honey or molasses, measure the oil first, pour it into the recipe, then measure the sweetener., Some ingredients, like shortening and yogurt, are definitely not as runny as water. However, they’re too thick to measure using the dip-and-sweep method you might use for flour or sugar. In this case, it’s best to use a solid measuring cup and pack in the shortening or yogurt, using the back of a spoon to press it down firmly.


Line the cup with plastic wrap to make removal easier.Scoop the cup full of the ingredient. Push down on the ingredient with the back of a spoon, to make sure no air bubbles remain. Then, level off with a butter knife.Lift the ingredient out of the measuring cup with the plastic wrap, then transfer it to the recipe.
 Butter is a solid ingredient that is often melted and used as a liquid in recipes. Its advantage is that measurements are often clearly marked onto the stick; just slice along the guideline to remove the correct amount of solid butter, then melt if you so desire.Butter sticks come in a standard size, which makes measuring large quantities of butter even easier. A standard stick is ½ cup and ¼ pound, or 113 grams.
 Push-style measuring cups have a plunger you can set to the amount of the ingredient you want. Once you have filled them to that level, you can just push the ingredients out. This works really well with sticky ingredients like peanut butter and mayonnaise.

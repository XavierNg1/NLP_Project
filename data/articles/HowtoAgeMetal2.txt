 This is an ideal process if you want to create a white, aged or mineralized look. You may even be able to create a little bit of rust in some areas.
 Choose 80-grit sandpaper. Rub away at the surface until the shininess and slickness of the finish is gone. Wipe down the piece to clear away any debris.
 You may also want to spread a plastic sheet on the ground to protect it from exposure to the chemicals.


Wear safety glasses, gloves, and a long-sleeved shirt. Toilet bowl cleaner can be pretty strong stuff. It can ruin your clothes and irritate your skin and eyes if you come in direct contact.



Dip a steel wool pad in the cleaner and rub it all over the metal object.Be sure to get any handles or similar areas as well. Apply cleaner as needed until the entire surface is covered.
 You will be able to actually see the metal aging before your eyes. If you aren't happy with the results, let the metal soak a bit longer.
 You can use your rubber gloves to help wipe away the cleaner as you rinse. Be sure all of the chemicals are removed and disposed of safely. Dry the metal off before using.

 Decide which Sunday paper has the most coupons.
 Some papers offer the ability to get several copies of a Sunday paper to get more coupons. If you plan to do extreme couponing, the cost of the subscription can be easily recouped.



Make friends with a local shop owner who sells newspapers. Ask to pick up the extra Sunday newspapers. You can also offer to buy them at a lower rate on Monday.
Visit local cafes, libraries and fast food places that buy newspapers. Go through their newspapers to find extra coupons.
Check through recycle bins in apartment complexes. People usually throw out their coupon sheets as junk mail.
 File them by store you will use.

 Empty any containers or bags you have, and leave them off to the side in a separate pile. Make sure the containers have their very own pile for the dresser.
 Even if it takes a while, choose what types of items (i.e. folders, magazines, etc.) you wish to keep in the containers. Write the use on a sticky note and press it onto the container. This will make things easier to remember later on.
 Have at least the main three: keep, recycle, and throw away. Put everything into its according stash. Label them with sticky notes if you find it necessary.


Keep the mounds a good distance away from each other. This way, nothing will fall or stray away into the wrong clutter.
 Push your keep pile away from the others, and then label the different bags (paper ones work best; you can also use small bins or containers) as so: donate, recycle, throw away. Go through your recycling and trash piles and pick out nice or salvageable things to donate to those in need. In the end, you can put the rest of the things into their according bags or bins.


Donating is one of the best ways to feel fantastic about cleaning your room. Not only are you getting an organised, fresh room, but you know that your things will go to a person who needs them.
 Set up decorations how you wish on the top of your dresser. Finally, scoop the rest of your things near the containers. We'll work with those items later.

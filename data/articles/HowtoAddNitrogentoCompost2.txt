 Add one part coffee grounds to one part grass clippings and one part leaves to create a nitrogen rich compost pile. Coffee grounds contain 20 parts of nitrogen to one part of carbon, making it an exceptionally nitrogen-rich amendment.Use the leftover coffee grounds from after you brew coffee.
If mold grows on your coffee grounds you can still use them because it will be broken down during the composting process.
 Instead of throwing away vegetable and fruit scraps, add them to your compost pile after you're done with ingredient preparation. These are high in organic material and will add nitrogen to your compost pile., These compost ingredients will attract wild animals and aren't ideal for compost. You should also avoid adding pet feces to the compost because it could spread disease.

 Potato chips are often labeled as a junk food. However, you can make your own chips using healthier ingredients and methods. Try slicing sweet potatoes and baking them with a touch of olive oil. Or, use a mandoline to slice a zucchini, toss these with olive oil, and then bake.Most of these chips can be stored for up to a week. Therefore, they make a great snack.
You can also make healthy chips using plantains, kale, greens, or even apples., Every few days, chop up a number of fruits and vegetable and store the slices in airtight containers. You can then dip these slices into Greek yogurt, ranch dip, or even hummus for a quick snack. For something sweeter, try fruits, such as mango or pineapple, paired with a caramel sauce.Taking this approach can also save you time as most of these dips, and fresh produce slices, are also sold in grocery stores.Dips that are high in salt, fat, or sugar, such as caramel sauce, should be used sparingly in accordance with the portion size suggested on the packaging. Dips such as hummus and yogurt may be used more liberally.
 Using a blender or food processor, add in milk or yogurt and then a handful of fruit or vegetable slices. Pulse until the mixture is smooth and drinkable. A basic concoction of yogurt, banana, and ice is always nice. Or, you could mix together yogurt, protein powder, and a vegetable, such as kale or spinach.For extra crunchiness, toss in a handful of ice.
 If you are adding produce to your diet and trying to lose weight, you may be tempted to cut out dessert entirely. Instead, replace a high-fat, high calorie dessert with something healthier made primarily from fruits. You could freeze grapes for a quick snack. Or, you could slice a banana and dip it into yogurt., Pack a small container of applesauce. Place a handful of baby carrots into a plastic lunch bag. Or, just grab an apple or banana to take with you. Dried fruit is another convenient snack option, although be careful of the sugar content.

 While there is a star near the South Celestial Pole, Sigma Octantis, it’s too dim to do you much good for finding south.Instead, look for the bright constellation Crux, the Southern Cross, which consists of four stars that form the ends of the cross’ upright and crosspiece.The Southern Cross is so prominent a constellation that it is depicted on the flags of Australia and New Zealand.
 The point along this line, about four-and-a-half times the length of the long axis is directly above south.(optionally) Improve your accuracy by finding the two "pointers" to the southern cross and drawing a line through them. Then take a line perpendicular from the middle of that and extend it to intersect with the line drawn from the Southern Cross. Where they intersect is directly above south.
Drawing a line through the two stars of the crosspiece will point you to the star Alpha Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the sun.(This star is also depicted on the flag of Australia, but not of New Zealand.)

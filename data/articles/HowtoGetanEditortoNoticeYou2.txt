 Small publications may have only a single editor, while larger publications may have an editor for each department in which they publish. Learning who the right editor is and addressing him or her by name will earn you that editor's notice and show you as a writer who cares about detail. Editors are listed under their publication's listing in the current "Writer's Market" or on the publication's website.


If you are looking for a specific editor's name on a publication website and it's not given, you can often derive the editor's email address by looking for the email address for one of the publication's other representatives. Note the format the identifier component of the email address is in; common formats are "Firstname.Lastname," "Firstname_Lastname," "InitialLastname," or "LastnameInitial." Generally, all email addresses for the same entity follow the same format, except when someone goes by his or her initials or when more than 1 person at the publication has the same first and last name. If you have any doubts as to who the right editor is, you can always ask them via Twitter, LinkedIn, or other social media connection.
 Although electronic communications such as email and instant messaging have made written communications easier and less formal than letters, you still need to maintain a professional tone. You can use "Hello" or "Hi" in your salutations, or even the "Dear" used in written letters, but not something like "Yo" or "What up, dude." You need to spell out every word correctly in your message; you can't get by with textspeak shorthand. You also need to follow the rules for capitalization and punctuation, unless you plan to market yourself to a poetry magazine as the next E.E. Cummings.


As you develop a working relationship with an editor, you may find that your communication with him or her goes beyond the bounds of your current or future writing projects. Even when your editor becomes your friend, keep the tone professional. (You'll find this easier if your normal communication style is a professional-sounding one.)
The professional tone should extend to your website and social media pages as well. If you make it a practice to include the URLs of your website and social media pages in your email signature, which you should, the content of those pages should be as well-written and professional as the content of your emails.
 Your correspondence with an editor should be focused and short. Queries should be about a page (5 to 6 paragraphs) in length, and letters of introduction running 1 to 2 pages, not including any accompanying referrals. Leave out any personal information that doesn't relate to your expertise as a writer in general or to the subject you plan to write about.


When communicating by email, make the subject line pertinent to the purpose of your email. While "Hello" is an appropriate salutation, it isn't specific enough for an email subject line. If your email is to introduce you to the editor, a better subject line would be "Interested in writing for ." If the email is a query, something like "Proposed article:" followed by either the subject you plan to write on or the title you have in mind.
 Prompt replies show you as a writer the editor can depend upon with a time-critical assignment. If you don't have an answer right away, reply by saying that you don't have the answer but will have it by a certain time ï¿½ and then deliver by that time, if not before.


Feel free to take the advice Scotty gives Geordi LaForge in the "Star Trek: The Next Generation" episode "Relics" and deliberately quote a longer period of time (within reason) to deliver than what you think you actually need. You may well find you'll need that extra time, and as long as you deliver by the date you promised, no one needs to know that you can deliver in much less time than that.

 You'll need to create several clues to the "finder" to alert them to the next place where they'll find the next clue.;
, These can include Disney hats, Disney Park maps, Disney character hats, those flashy night-lights they sell in the parks. Only use stuff that is associated to the Disney parks.
,, The key is to keep your kids mind's thinking, yet still keeping them uninformed until the very end.
 Make sure to disperse them into several rooms over long distances. If you have more than one floor, you can even have them chase up and down the stairs at times. Criss-cross the notes. If you can, have the clues hit into every room of your house.
 Check to make sure your route your kids can safely get there, without crossing into a former location's answer.


A light mark of a pencil can help make sure you haven't crossed into a previous location's clue a second time around.
Clues that are in a room, can be placed in two different spots, but make sure they are easy to get access to.
 This could probably be inside cabinets in the bathroom or inside a master bedroom, or wherever you decide it imperative for them not to look.
 That means that you are going to Walt Disney World!" You can always speak these words, if your children can't read well, or there isn't enough lighting to cover the area.
 You'll be doing the reveal of the special trip after only a few seconds.

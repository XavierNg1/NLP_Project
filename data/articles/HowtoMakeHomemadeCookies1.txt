;
, Put the flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl and whisk them together.
 Place them in a large bowl and use a hand mixer to beat them together until the butter and sugars are fully combined and the mixture has turned light and fluffy.
 Keep beating the mixture until the eggs and vanilla are completely blended in.
 Use a long-handled spoon to stir the dry ingredients in with the wet; keep stirring until you can't see any white specks of flour.
 Pour them into the bowl and use the spoon to mix them in with the batter.
 Use a spoon or a small ice cream scoop to scoop even amounts of batter onto a baking sheet. Space them an inch or two apart so they'll have room to spread while baking.To keep the cookies from sticking to the baking sheet, you can line it with parchment paper before placing the cookies on it.
For perfectly even cookies, use a 1/8 measuring cup to scoop the batter.
 Place the cookie sheet in the oven and bake the cookies for 15 minutes, or until they turn golden brown on top and the edges look slightly crisp.
 Place them on a cooling rack or move them to a plate and let them cool until they aren't too hot to eat.
 Enjoy!

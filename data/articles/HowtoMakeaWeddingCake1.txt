 The oven needs to be preheated to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (162.78 degrees Celsius). Get three round pans, measuring about 6, 9, and 12 inches (15.25, 23, and 30.5 cm) each. Rub solid vegetable shortening over the interior of the pans and add a little flour into each. Shake the flour around so that it coats the entire interior surface of all three pans.;
, Sift the two ingredients together into a large bowl and set them aside for later use.
 Add the butter and sugar together into a large bowl and beat them on medium to high speed using an electric hand mixer or stand mixer. Continue beating until the butter and sugar combination takes on a fluffy texture and appearance. Set this aside, as well.
 Use an electric mixer to beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Do not over-beat the egg whites to the point of becoming dry, though. Set the beaten eggs aside.
 Slowly add the flour mixture into the bowl containing the butter mixture, beating it with an electric mixer at a slow speed. Alternate small amounts of the flour mixture with small amounts of milk. Make sure that the new addition is thoroughly beaten into the batter before adding more flour or milk.
 Pour the vanilla into the batter and beat until combined.
 Add the egg whites on top of the batter and use a spatula to carefully fold the batter over egg whites. "Squishing" the egg whites down, beating them in, or stirring too vigorously will cause the egg whites to deflate, leaving you with an unpleasantly dense cake.
 Fill each pan about halfway. If excess batter remains, add it to the pans in equal amounts until it is gone.
 Baking time should take about 50 to 60 minutes, but you can begin checking it after 30 minutes to make sure that it has not started to burn. The cake is done once a knife or toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean.

 Ideal catalogs for this craft include any catalog that contains pictures of plants or flowers. You will also need a sheet of blank or construction paper (preferably brown so that it looks like soil), scissors, glue or tape.

You could also use white paper, and use coloring pencils or markers to draw on soil, grass, sky and trees, etc.
 Mark the pages that have pictures you want with a post-it note, or something of that sort (even strips torn from another catalog can make useful bookmarks––just recycle them when you've finished with them).

As you select images, check each side of the selected pages to make sure that cutting out your picture won't involve cutting through another, more interesting one.
 Place them somewhere that is easy to see them all, alongside the construction paper., Do this without gluing anything down, so that you can change things around until you're absolutely happy with the final design., After you've placed all your pictures, glue them down. Take care not to knock unglued ones out of the way as you work., You can now stick the image up somewhere or use it in some other craft project that you have in mind.

This picture might also make good wrapping paper; be sure that the glue holds the images really well if you intend using it for this purpose.

 Newborns typically sleep 16â€“18 hours a day. They usually wake up every two to three hours to eat. The length of time your baby sleeps each time will vary. Some babies will start to sleep five to six hours a night around two months of age.Learn what is normal for your baby.
Newborns do not know the difference between night and day so be prepared to run on very little sleep.
 A newborn baby should only sleep on his back. Do not place him on his side or stomach to sleep. Stomach sleeping can lead to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Stomach sleeping can block the baby's airway and cause the baby to get too hot.
 The bottom sheet should fit tightly. Keep items such as pillows, blankets, and toys out of the crib or bassinet. Anything loose in the crib is a hazard and could suffocate your baby. Also be sure that there are no items that can get caught around the baby's neck such as ribbons, cords, or ties.Any crib you use should meet current safety standards.
Consider putting your baby in a sleep sack since a loose blanket is dangerous.
 Although your newborn may be too young to understand a bedtime routine, starting one now may be helpful in the future. Routines may include bathing, reading, and singing. Keep the lights low and create a calm environment.You can rock and cuddle with your baby to encourage sleep.
The room should be at a comfortable temperature.

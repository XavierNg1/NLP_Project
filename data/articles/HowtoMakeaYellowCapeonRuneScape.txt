 You can kill a Highwayman for a black cape, or buy a red cape for 25 gp in Varrock. You can also use the Grand Exchange in Varrock to buy one.;
, Onion fields can be found north of Rimmington, and south of Draynor bank.
 This can easily be obtained from your bank, or killing someone (e.g. Goblin, Highwayman, Man).
 Search for the witch named Aggie in Draynor Village, who sells potions and dyes. She will be in one of the houses with a cauldron.
 She will then give you a bottle of yellow dye.
 You should now have a yellow cape to wear!

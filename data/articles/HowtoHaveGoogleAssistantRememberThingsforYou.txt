 On most Android devices, you can tap and hold the home button to launch Assistant. You may also be able to say “OK Google” when you’re at the home screen. The Assistant will respond with, “Hi, how can I help you?”
, Begin with the word “Remember.” When you’re done speaking or typing what you want it to remember, the Assistant will respond with “OK, I’ll remember that.” Here are some examples:

"Remember that my passport is in the top drawer."
"Remember that Henry’s birthday is on Monday."
"Remember that my book is in the trunk."

, When you need to recall what you told Google to remember, launch Google Assistant (say “OK Google” at the home screen or long-press the home button) and say or type your question. Assistant will reply with the answer, as well as the date on which you provided information. Here are some different ways to ask:

"Where is my passport?"
"When is Henry’s birthday?"
"Where did I tell you I put my book?"

 They love guys with a great smile and a nice posture. Show that you like to be around them and make it obvious that you're interested.;
, They like to be touched, like everyone else, but only when they allow it! If you touch someone uninvited, it can really be an abuse. It doesn't matter if she is shy or not, respect her space.
 It might seem random, but Brazilian girls are automatically attracted to guys that smell nice, even if you're not a Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio. They like refreshing scents, and this is true for every Brazilian girl - smell like if you have just came out of a great bath, and it will open many doors for you.
 Most of them like guys that know what they want. But some others prefer to take the initiative. So, if you are too shy too ask them out, look for Brazilian girls who take the initiative, and give them some tips so that they can know you are interested.
 If you want to make a good impression on a good looking girl, ALWAYS wear nice clothes. A tight shirt and well fitting jeans will open doors for you.
 If you're not Brazilian, they will find you sexy because you're different. This is a good thing! Compliment her in your language, and she will automatically want to know what it means. When you translate it, she will melt down with your sweet talk. And if you're talking with a girl that speaks your language, try to make her teach you some Portuguese - and don't be scared of not saying what she teaches you in the correct . You'll be rated as cute, funny and approachable!

, Many guys think that just because they have nice bodies and are more open to flirting than some other girls out there, she will date everyone. Treat them with respect, but show you like their company and you'll be fine.

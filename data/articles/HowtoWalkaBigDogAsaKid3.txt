 Some dog breeds are recommended for homes in which kids live, in part because of a peaceful and otherwise friendly nature. Bringing any dog into a home with children is a serious endeavor, and this is especially true if youâ€™re considering a larger than average dog.Those breeds that do have a favorable reputation regarding interactions with children include Bernese Mountain Dogs, Collies, Mastiffs, German Shepherds, Newfoundlands, Golden Retrievers, and Labrador Retrievers.
 Note that any dog can become aggressive. For this reason and for the safety of the dog, young children should never be left alone with a dog, especially a large dog. Large dogs may be especially likely to physically exert dominance over a small child, and risk hurting them., Once your kids begin to want to walk the dog, be sure to accompany them until you're sure that they are safely able to do so on their own. If your child is too small physically, allow them to hold the leash with you. Once it seems that a child is ready to walk a large dog on their own, accompany them as they practice walking the dog from start to finish.Your presence as an adult will help make sure that the dog does not try to misbehave, and will increase your child's comfort handling the family dog.
When specific issues come up during shared walks - such as a neighborhood dog that is off leash - talk through the scenario together and take over if need be.

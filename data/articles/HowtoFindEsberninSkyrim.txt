 This is the town on the southeastern corner of the map. Right after completing the “Diplomatic Immunity” quest, travel straight southeast from the city of Whiterun, passing two rivers until you come across a town just beside a lake; this is the town of Riften.;
, Inside you’ll find a man named Brynjolf. Talk to him and he will tell you that Esbern can be found in the Ratways. This starts the quest called “A Cornered Rat.”


Esbern will only spawn in the game once you’ve started the “A Cornered Rat” quest.
 Go to the Marketplace at the center of the town, which happens to be just on the right side of the Bee and Barb. Go to the western side of the Marketplace to find a small door. Step inside the door to get to the underground area of the town called the Ratways.


The wide hall you dropped into is called the Ragged Flagon.
 Once you’re inside the Ratways, take the doorway on the south side of the Ragged Flagon. This will lead you to the Ratway Vaults.
 The Ratway Vaults has three rooms. Go straight through the halls (the halls do not branch out so you won’t get lost) up to the third room where you’ll find a door that leads to the Ratway Warrens.
 The Ratway Warrens has only two rooms. Once you step inside the Warrens, take the door on the right of where you came in to go to the next room. Once you get inside the second room, you’ll find Esbern in his hideout on the south side of the area.


There you go, you’ve just located Esbern. Talk to him and he’ll give you the rest of the details about your quest.

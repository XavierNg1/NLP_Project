 Unscrew the aerator at the end of the faucet with a pair of pliers. Disassemble the aerator, making a note of how it fits together. Rinse off dirt or sediment, then run the faucet for a couple minutes to dislodge sediment in the pipe. If the aerator parts still look dirty, soak them in an equal mix of white vinegar and water for three hours.


To avoid scratches, wrap cloth around the aerator before removing.
You can clean showerheads with the same process.;
, If the faucet still has low pressure, unscrew the stem retainer nut and pull the stem straight up. You may need to remove a retaining collar first.


When dealing with a single-handled tub faucet, you will encounter a screw on each side, under the large chrome piece. Assure that these are both fully tightened before removing the stem.
 Check for problems based on what you see:


If you see a washer and/or spring at the base of the stem, remove them carefully with a screwdriver. Rinse off sediment, or replace them if broken.
If you see a more complex mechanism, check this article for instructions.
 After repairing anything that seems amiss, reassemble the faucet. Block the faucet with a cup and turn the water on and off a few times. This should flush out anything causing the clog.

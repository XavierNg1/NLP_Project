 The styrofoam cup will act as an insulator that allows you to pick up the pie pan without touching it. This will be important for charging the Leyden jar effectively. Tape the cup in the center of the pie pan, on the inside of the pan (where the pie would go).The pie pan is functioning as a electro-porous, or charge carrier.
 You will use the foam plate because foam is an insulator. When you add or remove electrons from the foam, the charge will not travel. Instead, the foam will hold it’s charge until the charge is dissipated by things like moisture in the air., Rub wool on the foam plate to deposit electrons onto the plate. The electrons from the wool are attracted to the foam and “stick” to it. This gives the foam a negative charge., Pick the pie pan up by touching only the styrofoam cup. Rest the pie pan on top of the foam plate. This will allow the negative charge of the foam plate to push against the electrons on the pie pan., Touching the pie pan creates a path for the electrons on the pie pan to move away from the electrons on the styrofoam. This happens because electrons are all negatively charged, and thus repel one another. When you touch the pan, you are likely to see, hear, or feel a spark. This spark is the result of electrons moving from the pie pan to your finger, leaving the pan with a positive charge., When you touch the positively charged pie pan to the nail you will pull electrons from the inner electrode (the nail and conductive material inside the jar). This balances the charge on the pie pan, but leaves a positive charge on the inner electrode. Be sure hold the jar by the outer electrode (the foil on the outside of the jar) and not to touch the inner electrode with anything but the pie pan (e.g. your finger).You can repeat this process several times to build a stronger charge in the Leyden jar.
As electrons move from the inner electrode to the pie pan, you are likely to hear or see a spark.

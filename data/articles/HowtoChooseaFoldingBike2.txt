 Unfortunately, most manufacturers of folding bikes only offer frames in one size. If you are taller than average or shorter than average, you may have trouble finding a folding bike in the best size for you., There are generally five different sizes of folding bike wheels. The size that will work best for you depends mainly on when and where you plan to ride your bike.The larger the wheel size, the larger your bike will be when it's folded, since the bike cannot fold up any smaller than the wheels. If you plan to use public transportation frequently, you probably want a smaller wheel.
Smaller wheels are more difficult to maneuver on uneven surfaces and trails. If you plan on going through longer bike rides through the countryside, you may want to go with larger wheels.
 If you have difficulty finding a bike of the right frame size, you may be able to adjust the bar ends or use a different seat. This can help you find a good riding position, especially on longer rides.Speak to someone in a bicycle repair or specialty shop to assess your options. You may have to experiment with adaptations to find the best fit.

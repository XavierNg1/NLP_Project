 Use that goal to keep your mind active.;
, Interest is the key factor in studying. Acquire it first before studying.
 Even if you have a goal, you can't go very far without motivation, so watch videos or read articles that motivate you to study.
 Know what you have to do in a certain amount of time. Take a paper and write down the amount of chapters you have to do in a week. Don't keep your schedule too tight!, Studying alone works best when you have limited time. Make sure you don't have any distractions.
 Don't waste time walking around and looking for things you don't need.
 Reading doesn't transfer the information into long term memory.You might understand all the stuff but you will forget it after a day or two. Quickly revise the chapters you studied the day before for the first 5 minutes of your study session.
 It will give you the outline of the chapter so you can study more effectively.
 This will help you remember much more faster than simply reading.
 We already removed all distractions in Step 4 but remember those includes your mobile phones, laptops, PCs, etc. which distracts you.
 This is the best time to revise. One good strategy is to revise all your week's work on Sunday, this will give your mind some rest and you won't forget everything.
 Make it a habit, studying an hour should be must no matter which day it is. It will be tough at first but as time goes it will become a habit.
 Write down important points, formulas, reactions, equations, etc. This is extremely helpful when revising during exams., When you are studying for a short time, breaks are not advised. If you are planning to study for more than one hour then take break after 45 min., Don't study the same subject each day, instead try studying different topics every other day.

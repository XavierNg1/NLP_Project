, Smooth out any wrinkles.


Iron if needed.
 Use good quality fabric scissors for a clean cut.
 Measure at least 7.5cm or 3 inches from the base of the t-shirt to reach the bag's base point (everything below this gets turned into fringe). Draw a line across the point chosen, using tailor's chalk or other fabric sewing marker.


Do your best to include all of the logo or picture at this stage; cutting it off to be part of the fringe won't look that effective.
 Place these at 2.5cm/1 inch intervals. These form the fringe.
 Cut all of the vertical lines up to the horizontal line. Do not cut beyond the horizontal line.


This includes cutting open the sides of the t-shirt from the base to the horizontal line.
 Cut as close to the seam as you can manage.


For the neck hole, you may choose to leave it or cut it. Estimate how much space there is to fit in groceries before deciding.
Always undercut the neck space; you can always cut more if needed.
 Tie front and back fringe strips together using square knots. Do this right across the bag until all the fringe strips are tied in place. This will make the base of the bag. If you don't like the small gap holes this process leaves, run a line of stitching across the base, just above the tied fringe.
 This step is optional but pretty. You can tie on beads, bells, etc.
 The bag is now ready for carrying your groceries.

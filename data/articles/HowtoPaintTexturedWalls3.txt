 If this fails to adequately cover the texture, switch to one with a 1 1/4-inch (3 cm) nap.
 Dip the roller in the paint several times and rake it over a screen to distribute and take off the excess paint.


Don't dip the roller into the paint so far that paint enters the hollow center. This will leave drips of paint on the walls.
 If this doesn't do an adequate job, roll the paint on in a "V" pattern, then follow up with vertical strokes.


Because of the amount of paint that the roller will hold and the increased possibility of splatter, use the roller more slowly than if you were painting a smooth wall.
 Remove the excess with a dry roller.

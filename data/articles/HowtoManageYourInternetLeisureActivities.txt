 Include any work hours, family time, personal needs (such as eating, sleeping, bathing, etc). The remaining or "leftover" time can be labeled as your internet time/leisure. Always make sure that you leave any online activities out of your list until you have completed your IRL (in real life) activities.;
, Create a list of the top 5 sites you visit on a regular basis. You can also make a list of the most important websites, for example email, any social networking, etc. that you go to. Are message boards more important than Facebook? Ask yourself these kinds of questions.
 Think about what you need to do on each site. Needs should come before wants, or else you may find yourself on one site longer than you think.
 Be honest with yourself and follow the timer if you're on a strict schedule.

example.net 15 minutes.
example.org 15 minutes.
example.com 30 minutes.
 Reward yourself when you keep to it.

 Foot files or scrapers are metal products that look sort of like cheese graters. Sometimes, they are also made of clay. You can use them to grate the dry, tough skin off the bottoms of your feet. With regular use, the feet will become smooth. A more aggressive way to remove very thick calluses are callus shaves, which are sharp, horizontal blades that look similar to a very small cheese slicer. Don’t remove a callus entirely. If the removal becomes painful, stop. You can also buy foot files in the shape of plastic eggs.
Using the scraper or the stone, remove all the dead skin. Apply a moisturizing cream while massaging the skin when you are done.
 Pumice stones can be found in most beauty stores, and they are an alternative to a scraper, which is often made of metal. They work really well at buffing the feet and removing dead skin cells.The pumice stone will scrape the top layer of dead skin cells off your feet, dramatically improving their smoothness. Remove skin when it is dry to avoid injury. Rub the pumice block directly onto calluses and rough patches to rub off dead and useless skin.
Don’t rub too hard or long as you can easily irritate or injure your feet. Use soft back and forth motions and apply little pressure.
You could also regularly use an exfoliating soap that you buy at the supermarket. You won’t have as much work to do with the pumice stone then!

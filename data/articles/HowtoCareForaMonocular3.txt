 If your monocular does become wet, you may be able to dry it off. After use, gently wipe the monocular down using a dry cloth or rag. Be careful around the lenses; you may want to use a cotton ball for these. Afterwards, let it sit out in a dry place until it has completely dried. Only once it is dry should you return it to its case.If water gets inside the monocular, it may fog up during use, particularly if you are in a warm place. Air out your monocular in a dry area for a few days. This may solve the problem. Water inside the monocular may cause dirt to interfere with the optics or encourage the growth of fungus, which can block your lens. If this happens, you will need to replace your monocular., If you have taken your monocular out on the ocean, your lens might be coated with brine or salt. This can cause blurriness in your lens, and it may scratch the coating.It is best to remove the salt before you put your monocular away. To remove salt deposits, dampen a cotton ball, and squeeze out the excess water. Gently rub the salt off the lens. Wipe it dry with a clean cotton ball.Make sure it is completely dry before you put it in its case.
 When the monocular is not in use, you should place it in a case. If your monocular came with a cap, make sure that it is secured on the monocular. Put the case in a dry area that is free from dust.Sometimes monoculars come in storage bags instead of cases. You can still store it safely in the bag, but make sure that the bag is closed when you store it so that dust does not enter it.

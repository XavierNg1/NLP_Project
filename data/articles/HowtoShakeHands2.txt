 If you offer someone your extended hand when they aren’t paying attention, they may not shake your hand. While this situation is embarrassing, it doesn’t mean that the other person is unwilling to shake your hand. Instead, announce yourself with a greeting or a farewell to get their attention. Some examples of good phrases include:


“Hey, Robert! It’s been a while, how are you doing?”
“Excuse me, Mrs. Becker? Hi, I’m Ian. I work in the Engineering department. It’s nice to meet you!”
“We’re headed out, James. Thanks for the wonderful party! We had a great time!”

, This can include grasping someone’s hand too firmly or letting your hand go limp mid-handshake. If you apply too much pressure, you’ll come across as arrogant and aggressive. However, if you shake someone’s hand too limply they may think you don’t care about meeting them.Practice with a friend if you need help gauging your handshake pressure.
 If you give someone a sweaty hand to shake, you may gross them out. Before shaking their hand, subtly dry your own hand against the side of your pants or skirt.If you’re holding a drink, hold it in your left hand so that the condensation doesn’t make your hand feel wet and sweaty.


If you experience chronic hand sweat, spray your hands with an antiperspirant once a day. This will help your hands stay dry.

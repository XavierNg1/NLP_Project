 Although turmeric is usually thought of as a cooking spice, it’s also effective as a pain reliever due to its anti-inflammatory properties.Turmeric is most useful for homeopathic purposes when made into a paste.


To make the turmeric paste, mix 2 tablespoons of turmeric powder and 1 tablespoon of lime juice. Add a small amount of boiling water to the mixture, and stir until it develops a thick consistency. You can apply this directly to your bruise or sprain. Hold the paste in place with a sheet of plastic wrap.Turmeric is a common spice and can be found at any grocery store or health food store.
 Rosemary is a common homeopathic herb, as it contains antioxidants (if ingested internally) and also has strong anti-inflammatory properties.To apply rosemary oil to a sprain, add a few drops of rosemary oil to a bucket of cold water. Soak a towel in the rosemary-infused water, and then wrap this cold towel around your sprain.Rosemary oil should be available at any homeopathy store, and also through online herb retailers.
 You can drink bilberry tea if you are someone who bruises easily. It is made from purple berries that taste good in a tea and will improve circulation and vein health, keeping you from bruising immediately any time you bump or hurt a part of your body.To make bilberry tea, you’ll need 1–3 teaspoons of crushed and dried berries. Boil 1 cup of water, and then pour the boiling water over the crushed berries. Let the mixture sit in a mug for 10–15 minutes. Strain out the berries, and your tea will be ready.

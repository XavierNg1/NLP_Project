 When you vomit or have diarrhea, you lose essential salts from your body. These salts include sodium, chloride, and calcium. In order to replenish these salt stores, you should try to drink Oral Rehydration Solutions (ORS). These solutions can provide your body with essential nutrients while also hydrating you.You can purchase commercially prepared ORS solutions at your local pharmacy. ORS are usually sold in packets that you mix with water. You can drink these solutions throughout the day.
You can also make homemade ORS. There are different kinds of solutions that you can make to get the essential salts and nutrients you need, while also hydrating yourself.
If your child is the one who is sick, give her five milliliters (about one teaspoon) of an ORS every one to two minutes. This should equal about 150 to 200 mL (5 to 7 ounces) of solution per hour.
 To make this solution, mix roughly Â½ teaspoon of common salt with five teaspoons of sugar. Add this to one liter (1 quart) of boiled water, and let the water cool.For an added boost of hydration, add some coconut water to the mixture.

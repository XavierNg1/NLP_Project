 They may find my ideas given above for pianists helpful, especially if they do as tenors in my choir do - transfer their music onto a piano and record that. A nasty problem occurs if a piece switches between clefs. You must realise that the music in the treble clef is written an octave higher than it is sung, so the G on the first black line must be played and sung as the G below middle C. Other notes must be lowered similarly. From experience; tenors think they are actually singing in the treble clef, so may prefer to raise the notes in the bass clef by an octave.

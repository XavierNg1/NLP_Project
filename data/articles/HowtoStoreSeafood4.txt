 As with fresh fish, store your leftovers in airtight containers to prevent the growth of bacteria and limit the risk of cross-contamination., Even cooked fish should be handled carefully, and should be left out no longer than 2 hours after being cooked. The longer food is left out after cooking, the higher the risk is of bacteria developing and growing. If you have left food out past this time frame, the safest option is to throw the food away., This temperature range is often called the “danger zone,” as it provides the ideal breeding ground for germs and bacteria. When storing your leftovers, make sure your fridge is set to a temperature below 40, and while cooking, make sure your oven has reached a temperature higher than 140., If you’ve made a dinner of fish and broccoli, for instance, store each in their own container. Fish goes dry and rancid faster than most vegetables, grains, and even other meats. Whenever possible, store fish with fat or marinades intact., Ideally, you should consume your leftover fish within 1-2 days. Any longer, and your fish may become dry or develop a slimy covering. Fish that has gone beyond this window should be thrown out.

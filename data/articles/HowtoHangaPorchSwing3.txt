 Connect a rope or chain to the front swing hook, then loop it up through the corresponding eyebolt or screw-eye on your porch ceiling. Connect the end of your rope or chain to the second swing hook on the same side of the porch swing that you connected the other end of your rope or chain.For instance, if you’re facing your porch swing and attempting to hang it, connect a chain to the front-left swing hook, loop it through the eyebolt, then connect the end that passed through the eyebolt onto the swing hook located at the back-left of the swing porch.
Repeat on the opposite side.
If your porch swing is heavy, have a friend help you lift the porch swing up to the height at which you wish to hang it before attaching it to the ceiling.
 Give it a push. If it moves properly back and forth, you’ve succeeded in hanging your porch swing. If you find that one end is not quite even with the other, leading to an off-kilter appearance, adjust the chain’s location on one or the other sides.For instance, if the right side of your porch swing is lower than the left, you’ll need to shorten the length of chain connecting the two swing screws on the right side.
Alternately, you could extend the length of chain between the two swing screws on the left side so that it sits lower.
 For an extra-smooth porch swing experience, attach comfort springs to each eyebolt or screw-eye, then attach your chain to the end of comfort spring. The comfort springs provide a bit of bounce on your porch swing and make its motion more fluid.

If you live in the great plains, or a heavy forest area, use one of the following: praying mantis, spiders, ants (black or fire ants, if you want more of a challenge), beetles, and grasshoppers.
If you live in a desert area, such as Arizona or Nevada, your choice is dangerous, but includes one of the most fierce fighters next to a stag beetle, the scorpion. Keep in mind that they are very dangerous and if you're going to handle them, wear a thick full sleeved shirt and leather gloves.
If you're in California, you could try for a trap door or jumping spider. They make for rather interesting fights. However, keep in mind that trap door spiders don't take their trap door with them, you have to fight in an arena.;
, Before you try to raise your bugs, get a plastic cage. You can get these at any decent pet store.
 For food, you have to consider what insect you are raising.


For carnivorous insects, you can use crickets, small spiders, grasshoppers (although you might kill them first in case they might kill your other insect.), flies, some types of larvae (beetle, caterpillar, grubs and maggots.) and ants.
For vegetarians, feed them leaves, and for each different species of insects, separate natural environments to live in that contain all of the resources needed to live.
Note: Do not feed your insects flowers as for many of them are poisonous to insects.
For beetles, mix some sugars into their diet, it makes them huge!

, For water, they should each get about 3mL a day. Some insects, such as grasshoppers and beetles, like to eat bread or cookie crumbs.
 The rules are very simple:


Get a cage that neither bug has lived in.
Put both bugs in the cage until they fight.
Remove the winner and return it to your cage.
The fight goes until one bug stops moving or tries to run out of the ring three times.
In a tournament, subbing out your insect per round is okay, if its the same species of bug.

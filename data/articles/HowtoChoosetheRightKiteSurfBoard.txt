 If you're a novice, there is no point picking an expert board as you will need be able to balance on it or control it. Spend some time researching before you go into the shop.;
, You need to be able to carry your board with one hand and fly through the air with it strapped to your feet, so make sure it doesn't feel too heavy.
 The bindings need to be secure enough so that the board doesn't slip off mid-flight but light enough for you to get your feet out quickly if things start going wrong. Test the straps before you buy them by slipping you feet in and out in the shop.
 Some boards come with a grab handle. This is a small handle in the middle of the board which allows you to do tricks in the air, such as taking the board on and off your feet, mid jump. If you're just starting out then this is probably not for you, but some boards have detachable grab handles so that the option is always there for later.

 Select a glossy satin or silk short-sleeved blouse for a slightly more elegant approach, or go with an edgy halter top with sequin detail for a bolder look appropriate for the night life.
, Think large dangle earrings, jingling bangle bracelets, and long necklaces. Add some color by choosing costume jewelry with colored gemstones, or keep things glitzy by sticking with solid silver or gold pieces and clear stones.
 If going a bit bolder, skip the stockings.
 Choose either a black purse or one that matches the color of your top. Alternatively, if you have colored jewelry, you could select a clutch in a bright color that matches your jewelry.

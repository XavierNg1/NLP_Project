 To make a handheld catapult using a plastic spoon, you need to gather a few supplies.Plastic spoon
Old fashioned clothes pin (clothes pin with a round top)
Electrical tape
Glue gun

, Squeeze hot glue into the clothespin in between the two prongs of the clothespin. Insert the handle end of the spoon in between the two prongs and into the glue. Hold firmly for 30 seconds for the glue to set.
 Wrap electrical tape around the outside of the clothespin where the spoon attaches. This will give the catapult some extra support.
 Use small items like marshmallows or pom poms to launch with your catapult. Hold your catapult with the clothespin side down and the spoon end up. Put the projectile in the spoon, gently bend it back, and launch.Try setting up a bucket or target to aim at.

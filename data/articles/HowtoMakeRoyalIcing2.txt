 Here's what you'll need to make about 5 cups of royal icing with meringue powder:









4 cups (950 mL) confectioners' (powdered or icing) sugar
3 tablespoons (15 mL) meringue powder
1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) extract (vanilla, lemon, almond)
1/2 - 3/4 cup (120 - 180 mL) warm water

, Many meringue powder labels contain specific instructions on how to make royal icing using their product â€” with powders varying from one product to the next. Adjust the recipe keeping the manufacturer's suggestions on the label in mind.
, This whole process takes anywhere from 5 to 7 minutes.
 When using royal icing as the glue with which to bind a gingerbread house, for example, you probably want stiffer peaks. In this case, add more sugar. When flooding a cookie, for example, you probably want a runnier icing. In this case, add more water.









Icing is ready to be used in flooding a cookie when the icing runs off the surface of the beater tong when it's lifted from the mixer.
 Royal icing hardens quickly if not properly stored.

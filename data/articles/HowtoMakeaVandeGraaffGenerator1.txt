 The larger it is, the more impressive its effects will be. The size will determine the dimensions of the main components: sphere, tower and base.;
, You can buy a hollow metal sphere or make one from materials you have on hand. Some possibilities are metal mixing bowls, gazing balls or a world globe sanded of its paint.
 This is a somewhat heavy box that serves to enclose the lower part of the generator and balance the weight of the metal sphere, so the generator won't be prone to tipping over.


Transparent thermoplastic is the best choice for the base. It will do a better job of keeping moisture from the air out of the generator, as moisture may interfere with the generator's functioning. It will also allow you to see how the generator works.
Include a hinged door large enough to allow you to reach inside. You need access to the interior of the box during construction and to make adjustments, if needed. If you use a motor to operate the generator, you will need to reach inside to turn the motor on and off.
 This is a tube that connects the base to the sphere and houses the belt and rollers. A good choice is a length of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe.

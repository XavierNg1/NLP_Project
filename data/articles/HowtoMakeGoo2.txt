 For the slimy borax method, you'll need a few supplies you may not have on hand. Pick up a small box of borax from the laundry section of your grocery store. You'll also need a bottle of standard-sized white school glue and some warm water. You can add food coloring to this recipe, too., Go ahead and squeeze out the entire thing. Use a spoon or a knife to help you get every last drop into the bowl.









Fill the glue bottle with warm water. Put your finger over the opening of the bottle and shake the bottle to loosen the remaining glue. Pour the gluey water into the bowl. Mix it with the glue to form a loose, gluey substance.
 Mix 1 teaspoon of borax with 1/2 cup of warm water. Stir it until the borax has dissolved. Add the mixture to the bowl with the glue, and stir well. The instant you add the borax, the mixture will start to form into goo.
 Use a spoon to stir in some food coloring. The mixture will have a white base, so a few drops of food coloring will give it a pastel hue.
 Borax is considered safe for kids to play with, but it should never be ingested. Make sure everyone who touches the borax goo knows not to eat it.

 Read local newspapers or join parenting groups to find out about activities or events that are happening in your area. Doing things in the area means that you won't have to travel far with your toddler, which can make an event stressful. If you have to return home, you're only a short trip away.


Planning an event nearby also means that you have more flexibility. If your child is sick or the weather is poor, you have more control over rescheduling than if you had planned on driving out of town and staying somewhere.;
, Consider what your toddler is curious about and try to foster that interest. For example, if your toddler is really active, think about taking them to an entry-level gymnastics class. Or if your toddler really loves animals, you could take them to the zoo for a few hours.


Ask your toddler if there's something they've always wanted to do. Your toddler may have some helpful suggestions, even if they just want to run around at the mall's kiddie area.
 You don't have to feel limited on where you take your toddler, but you should ask yourself if toddlers would be welcome. For example, while you could take your toddler to a large art festival, the crowds, lack of space for your toddler to walk around, and potential to break things might make you reconsider.


Similarly, if you want to take your child out to eat, think about if the restaurant usually accommodates children. You'll all be happier if you choose somewhere that's welcoming to families., You might find a place that's kid friendly, but if it isn't interactive, your toddler may tire of it easily. For example, your child might enjoy reading stories in the kids' section of the library, but may soon want to run around and play. Consider taking your child to a museum or exhibit that lets your toddler build or create things.Kids love to touch things, so be prepared to spend time monitoring your child regardless of where you go.

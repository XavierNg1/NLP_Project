 Scarves are a great accessory for a haori. Try an open long scarf that hangs down along the cut of the front of the haori. You can also wear a smaller scarf tied around your neck. Try looping a scarf around your neck or drape one around your shoulders.Choose a scarf that is in a complementary color to your haori. For example, if you are wearing a multi-colored haori, choose a scarf that matches a color in the pattern. If you are wearing a pastel blue toned haori, go for a complementary beige scarf.
 Though the traditional way to wear a haori is to leave it open as a jacket, you can wear your haori coat with a belt. Place it over your favorite base shirt and bottom or dress and then add a belt for a cinched look.Wearing the haori this way is similar to wearing a belt with a sweater, dress, or shirt.
 Because of the cut and patterns of the haori, large necklaces or ties may not go well with the outfit. Skip the statement necklaces and ties when wearing a haori. Instead, let the haori be the centerpiece of your top half., Haoris are easily paired with any kind of handbag. Small hand-held purses or large hobo bags go great with this style. Choose a handbag color that matches a color in the pattern or complements the colors of the haori., Haoris are so versatile and can be dressed up or down. They go with just about any shoe style. Your choice of shoes should be based on your overall outfit.

For example, if you are pairing the haori with jeans and a scarf, go for boots or flats. If you are pairing it with a dress, choose nicer boots, flats, or heels.
For a fun, bright pop of color, consider choosing shoes in a color that matches one of the colors in the pattern on your haori.

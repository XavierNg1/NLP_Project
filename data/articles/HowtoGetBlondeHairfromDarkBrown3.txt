 To bleach hair naturally, meaning the sun will be what activates the blonde in your hair, you will need lemon juice, chamomile tea (or tea bags) and hot water. This process will take a much longer time and can be used to bring out the natural highlights in your hair, but most likely won't bring you to a platinum blonde color.
 Steep five to ten chamomile tea bags for a few minutes in about half a liter (or two cups) of hot water in a microwave-safe glass measuring cup. Then, add about one half cup of lemon juice to your tea, pouring it into your solution until it becomes somewhat cloudy.The amount of lemon juice you'll need to use varies, so start with half a cup and pour it into your tea for a few seconds, stopping when your tea becomes a cloudy mixture.
 After you have combined the ingredients, you'll want to pour the entire mixture into a spray bottle so that you can apply it to your hair. Then, spray throughout your hair for an even coating. Your hair should be damp with the solution but not soaking wet.
 For the bleaching agents in the lemon juice to work, it will need to be exposed to the sun for a while. Stay outside in the sun until your hair dries, making sure to use sunscreen on the rest of your body to avoid damaging your skin. For the best results, leave the mixture on your hair for one to two hours.This method works slowly, gradually bringing out the highlights in your hair, so know that it may take several weeks, spraying your hair daily or every other day, before your hair really becomes blonde, especially if you have very dark brown hair.
 Anytime you lighten your hair, even with natural products, you should protect it and keep it moisturized by applying a conditioner. You can use a leave in conditioner or coconut oil.

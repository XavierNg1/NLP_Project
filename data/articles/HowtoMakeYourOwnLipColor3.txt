 Add 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of beeswax pastille, 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of shea butter, and 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of coconut oil to a glass jar. Place the jar in a small saucepan that’s halfway full of simmering water, and allow the contents to melt, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.You can find beeswax pastille at a variety of online retailers.
You can substitute cocoa butter for the shea butter if you prefer.
 The mixture in the glass jar will be clear, so you’ll need to add coloring to it. Add in a pinch or two of your chosen natural colorings to the beeswax mixture, and stir well until the mixture is the color that you want.Natural food coloring that’s made of vegetable colorants work really well to color homemade lip colors. They typically come in the primary shades of red, blue, and yellow, but you can mix those three to create a wide variety of colors. Start with a single drop of the coloring, and add more if necessary.
For red lip colors, you can also use beet root powder. Start with ⅛ of a teaspoon (.25 g), and see if you like the color before adding more.
For a brown lip color, you can mix in ¼ teaspoon (.5 g) of organic cocoa powder or a pinch of cinnamon or turmeric.
You can also mix a drop of an essential oil of your choice to the mixture to give it a pleasant scent if you want.
 Once you’ve mixed the beeswax mixture until it’s reached the desired color, use a medicine dropper to transfer it to a container, such as an empty lipstick container or a small cosmetics pot. Allow the lip color to cool completely until it solidifies, which should take approximately 2 to 3 hours, before applying.The lip color will expand slightly as it cools, so don’t fill your container all the way to the top.
You can purchase empty lipstick containers and other cosmetics containers from beauty supply stores and online retailers.

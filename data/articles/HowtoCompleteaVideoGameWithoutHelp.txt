 If you come by a part you find hard to proceed, admit this to yourself. Don't keep walking around in the game aimlessly cause this will only frustrate you. As soon as you know you are stuck, you can proceed to one of the following steps.;
, Horror and puzzle games tend to be quite logical and are solvable by just using your head. Adventure games (and most Japanese games as well) lack this kind of logic. For example, unscrewing screws with an owl even though you have a screwdriver in your pocket. (really) As soon as you know what type of game you're dealing with, you can think in that kind of logic.
 The best way to solve something hard is take a break for a while. Maybe even sleep a night. Thinking about something else allows you to have a fresh view on things when you try again.
 If it's a game from a series, think back (if you've ever played the previous games) how the puzzles were like. Also consider what the puzzles were like in the game itself.
 Sometimes the game gives you tips itself. Don't refuse to use them. If a game gives you tips it means it is a hard part and everybody struggles with it.
 If possible, go back or use a previous save. Sometimes, signs and conversations that seemed meaningless at the time, now reveal something important to finish a puzzle.
 Sometimes, the game itself saves codes and tips, but other times you have to remind them yourself. Writing down certain things is always useful.
 Don't get stressed or angry when it doesn't work. Keep calm, walk around a bit, interact with objects again and check your inventory.
 I know it isn't what you came here for, but sometimes you just need a hand. Either on internet of from friends/family members. Don't let it ruin a perfectly fun game for you.

 Although transmission rates are rather low, wild mice can carry diseases which could make you sick. Perform an internet search to determine the level of risk in your area. Take precautions to protect yourself.For example a wild mouse can transmit:


Hantavirus.
Salmonellosis (bacterial infection).
Lyme disease (from ticks)., The very best way to prevent the spread of germs from your mouse is to wash your hands after you touch it. Before washing your hands, avoid touching your mouth, eyes, or any part of your face. Washing with soap and water is best, but if you are not able to, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer is another option.


Wet your hands with water.
Lather with soap (any soap is fine).
Rub all surfaces of your hands.
Rinse and dry your hands.
 Salmonella bacteriaâ€”which results in the condition Salmonellosis--can be spread by mice. As such, it is important to keep your mouse away from the food that you eat.Never allow mice on countertops or in pantries.
Keep all of your food in secure, sealed containers.
 If you live in a region that is prone to ticks, be sure you check your mouse for ticks regularly (at least once a week). If you find a tick attached to your mouse, you will need to remove it.


Wear rubber gloves.
Clean the area with rubbing alcohol (try to smother the tick).
Use tweezers to carefully pull the tick off of your mouse.
Flush the tick down your toilet.

 Always close the doors, and check to make sure they fit against the shed tightly so that nothing gets in. If there are windows that open, make sure they are shut tight any time you are away from the shed. Look around doors and windows for gaps that need to be filled., If your windows and doors don't already have foam seals around them, add some. Foam weatherstripping usually comes in a roll and is easy to apply around door frames and windows. It creates a seal for gaps between doors and windows and the frame of the building., Insulation creates a waterproof layer around the inside structure of the shed. Staple insulation to the support studs of the shed, not to the outside paneling. Insulate the roof, as well as the walls.Bubble wrap is a cheap and effective way to insulate a shed, but you can also use standard fiberglass insulation.
Stapling insulation to the studs creates a small air pocket between the outer paneling and the insulation, which helps reduce moisture.

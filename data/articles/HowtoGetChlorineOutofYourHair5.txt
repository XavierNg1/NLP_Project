 Into a small bowl, squirt 1/4 cup (60 ml) of Prell shampoo.


Add a packet of Lemonade Kool-Aid powder
Be sure to use lemonade, rather than limeade, as limeade will accentuate the green. Lemonade will highlight the blond hair.
Blend thoroughly, and then rub the mixture in your hair
Let sit for 10 to 20 minutes, and then rinse thoroughly.
Wash your hair as normal.

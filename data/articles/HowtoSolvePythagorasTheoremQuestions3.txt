 A rectangle is a four-sided shape with four 90-degree angles., If you do not have these measurements, you cannot use this method.

For example, you might be asked to use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the diagonal of a 6-inch by 4-inch rectangle.
 Since the diagonal of a rectangle divides the shape into two congruent right triangles, you can use Pythagoras’s Theorem to find its length.

The length of the diagonal will equal the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangles.
 The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} is the length of the hypotenuse, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the lengths of the other sides of the triangle., Make sure you substitute for the variables a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}. It doesn’t matter which variable is the length and which is the width.

For example, for a 6-inch by 4-inch rectangle, the formula will look like this: 62+42=c2{\displaystyle 6^{2}+4^{2}=c^{2}}.
 Remember that squaring means to multiply a number by itself.

For example:62+42=c2{\displaystyle 6^{2}+4^{2}=c^{2}}36+16=c2{\displaystyle 36+16=c^{2}}


, This sum will give you the value of the hypotenuse, or diagonal, squared.

For example:36+16=c2{\displaystyle 36+16=c^{2}}52=c2{\displaystyle 52=c^{2}}


, This will give you the value of c{\displaystyle c}, which is the length of the right triangle’s hypotenuse, and also the length of the rectangle’s diagonal.

For example:52=c2{\displaystyle 52=c^{2}}52=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {52}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}7.21=c{\displaystyle 7.21=c}So, the diagonal of a 6-inch by 4-inch rectangle is 7.21 inches.

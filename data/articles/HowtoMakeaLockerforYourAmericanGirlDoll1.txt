 You'll also need plain construction paper.;
,


Measure out the paper carefully before cutting. It is easiest to cut pieces for each side of the box.
Glue each piece to the relevant part of the box.
Keep going until all sides are covered.
 Staple or glue one side of the lid to one long side of the box. Leave all other parts of the lid unglued.


You will need to bend the small side edges around the lid back to create the edge for stapling or gluing to the box. For the remaining edges on the lid/door piece, decide whether they are better removed altogether or see if they'll fit over the box when it closes as a door.
 Measure pieces of card to fit inside the shoe box. Glue them to two different levels inside, to form the shelves.
 Add some stickers and maybe the doll's name.
 Add things like a sweater, some books and her makeup.

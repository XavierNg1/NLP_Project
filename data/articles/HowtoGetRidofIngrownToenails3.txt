 Nails that are rounded have a higher chance of growing into the skin around the toes, creating problems.


Use toenail clippers or nail scissors to trim toes. Ordinary nail clippers are small enough that they tend to leave sharp edges near the corner of the toenail.
Optimally, try to cut your toenails once every 2-3 weeks. Unless your toenails grow extremely fast, cutting your toenails often won't give them a good chance to become ingrown.
 Pedicures can aggravate the skin underneath the nail; pedicure instruments can be less than sanitary, worsening or causing an infection.
 Shoes that are too small and press on your toenails can easily cause them to become ingrown. Opt for roomier, bigger shoes instead of smaller, cozier ones.


Try to wear open-toed shoes to prevent pressure on your toe. Since your toe should also be covered, use bandages or wear socks with sandals. Although this is unfashionable, it is better than having to get surgery.
 If you get an ingrown toenail once, you are likely to get it again, so take steps to prevent that from happening.
 After you get out of the shower in the morning, and once before going to bed, apply antibiotic cream to your entire foot, not just your toe. Antibiotic cream will help reduce the risk of infection, which can lead to complications and increased pain., Put Neosporin in the corner of your toe, by the ingrown toenail. Wrap a band-aid around the toe. Leave in place until the nail improves, then cut free.

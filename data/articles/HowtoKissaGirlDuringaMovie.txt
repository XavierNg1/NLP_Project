 Is there anything around that could embarrass you or her? Like that cup of Coke sitting on the armrest? Nothing ruins a romantic mood more than having a cold drink spilled on your lap! If possible, discreetly move the item, or take caution when making your move.;
, Don't try to kiss her during a shooting scene. You want to go for a romantic feeling. No girl wants to get romantic when some guy is getting his brains blown across the screen.
 Even if she doesn't give a sign of kissing you, you can still arouse her to kiss. If she starts scooting closer to you or even is she is sitting still, always put your arm around her and hold her close. If she's glancing over at you more than she is watching the movie, she's definitely thinking about kissing you. And if she's looking at your mouth, trust me, she wants you to kiss her.
 Once you've established that she's in the mood to kiss, make a move on her! There is one move that rarely fails with females. Have one arm wrapped around her, and then with the other hand, gently place your palm against her cheek and turn her face towards yours. Caress her face and kiss her cheek first gently. Move your thumb over her lips and let your eyes go back and forth between her eyes and her mouth. She'll get the hint, and get into a very romantic mood.
 Lean in. Gently brush your lips against hers. Kiss the corner of her mouth and make your way in. Take it from there. Do not shove your tongue down her throat! This will instantly kill the mood! Take it slow, gentle, and if she starts getting a little more heated, lucky you.

 Wiping your tile with a dry cloth every other day will help minimize surface dirt. The more often you do routine cleanings, the less frequently you will need to do serious deep cleans with soap and water or cleaning solution.


Creating a calendar reminder can help you remember to wipe your tile.
 Whether itâ€™s a glass of wine or some salsa, food and drink are full of acids and natural juices, which can deteriorate granite tile. When something spills, clean it up right away with soap and water, drying your tile completely. This will keep any potential stains from setting., Bits of grout breaking off can scratch your granite and trap dirt and grime. Cleaning is a great time to get up close and personal with your tile, examining the integrity of each stone and grout line. Be sure to replace chipped or broken tiles and have your grout touched up wherever necessary.
 While sealant is no substitute for cleaning, it can make your granite more resistant to water damage and other spills. Seal your granite once a year with a high-quality granite sealant, such as Rock Doctor Granite Sealer or Stone Pro Granite Sealer, to keep your tiles in good condition.

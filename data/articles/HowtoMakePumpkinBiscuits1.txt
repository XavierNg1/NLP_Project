 Lightly coat a baking sheet with butter or cooking spray and set it aside.;
, Keep mixing until all of the ingredients are evenly dispersed. If you can't find any cinnamon, nutmeg, or ginger, use 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead.
 You can do this using two crisscrossing knives or a pastry blender. Do not over-mix or your biscuits won't be soft and fluffy.
 If you are using canned pumpkin, make sure that you are using the plain, unsweetened kind. Do not use the "pumpkin pie" type because it contains other ingredients that will affect the recipe.
 Toss some flour onto a cutting board, and gently pat the dough out into a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick sheet. You can dust some flour onto it to keep it from sticking to your fingers., You can also use a glass that is 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wide instead.When you run out of dough to cut, ball it up and pat it out into another ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick sheet, and cut out more biscuits. Keep doing this until you've used up all the dough.
 Make sure that they are at least 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) apart. They will expand while baking; if they are too close, they will smoosh together. If your baking sheet is too small, set the rest aside, and bake them in another batch.
 Take the finished biscuits, and set them into a basket or platter. If you have any leftover biscuits, now is the time to bake them.
 They go great with butter, honey, or pumpkin butter.

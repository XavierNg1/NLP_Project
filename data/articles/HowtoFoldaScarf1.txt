 Take your scarf off and lay it down on your work area. Pull the edges until the scarf is completely flat against the surface underneath it.;
, Grab the narrow edge of the scarf at one end. Fold this end of the scarf up and over until it's lined up with the other end. Straighten the edges of the fabric so that they are lined up.


To be clear, you want to make a "hamburger fold," not a "hotdog fold." You should be making the scarf shorter, not skinnier.
 Grab the folded end of the scarf. Fold it over the top of the scarf until it's even with the "open" end of the scarf just like you did in the last step.
 Take the folded edge and fold it over the top of the scarf once again. Straighten the edges so that they're properly aligned. When you're done, the scarf should look a little like a small half sheet of paper.
 That's it! Your scarf is now ready to store in a closet, cabinet, pocket, or wherever else you may need to stash it. This simple but handy fold should keep it clean and free from wrinkles until you're ready to wear it again.

 If you have a flexible office space that allows you to work in more than one room or location, work in spaces that are far away from them. If you have some control over your work schedule, try to get shifts that do not coincide with their shifts. Find ways of working that limit the time and space you share at work., Although it might be difficult to work remotely all the time, you may be able to arrange working remotely every once in a while. Ask your boss if it is possible to work remotely on a particular day of the week or once a month. You can look forward to working remotely, since you won’t have to deal with the person you dislike in any face-to-face situations., If you are working with them on a number of projects, try to schedule meetings so that you have some time every week when you don’t have to interact with them.You might try moving a few meetings so that you have one day a week when you don’t have to interact with them at all.
 If you know where they eat lunch every day, you may as well avoid this location. If there is only one lunch room, try taking a walk at lunch time or driving to a nearby restaurant. This will cut down on the time you have to spend with the individual you dislike., Limit the time you spend with them outside of the workplace. You can find out if they are going to work parties, workshops, or other events and plan accordingly. If there are options that allow you to attend the event without seeing them, such as the same workshop offered on different days, take advantage of those options.If you are forced to attend the same event, prepare yourself in advance by doing some relaxation activities such as deep breathing or meditation.

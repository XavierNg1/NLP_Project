 Since a late period could indicate that you are pregnant, it might be helpful to take a pregnancy test. You can purchase reliable at-home pregnancy tests from most pharmacies and grocery stores. These tests involve urinating on the test stick and waiting a few minutes for the results to appear.At-home pregnancy tests are typically quite accurate. However, for the most accurate pregnancy tests, you should visit your doctor’s office.
 There are many physical factors that could be delaying the onset of your menstrual cycle. If you are worried, make an appointment with your doctor so that they can run some tests to determine the cause. At the very least, your doctor will be able to rule out some of the more serious medical possibilities and offer you some peace of mind.Your doctor will run tests to determine possible medical causes of your delayed period – like hormonal imbalance, thyroid issues, or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).
 In addition to preventing pregnancy, birth control pills are often used to help regulate periods. This kind of medication is quite effective at causing your body to begin the menstrual cycle at the same time each month.Remember that birth control pills aren’t for everyone. If you are forgetful about taking medicine, it won’t be as effective for you. If you are a smoker, there is a greater risk of stroke for those who take the pill and are over 35 years old.
Other forms of contraceptives may also help regulate your period – like intrauterine devices (IUDs). Ask your doctor which type is best for you based on your specific medical history, lifestyle, and personal preferences.

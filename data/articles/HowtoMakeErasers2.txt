 If the instructions for your eraser clay say to let them set using an oven, preheat it to the instructed time. Arrange your eraser designs on a baking sheet so they aren’t touching one another.


For most eraser clay, preheat the oven to 250° F (130° C). Bake erasers for 20 minutes per ¼ inch (6 mm) thickness.You may want to bake smaller eraser designs separate from larger ones, as they will likely have different cooking times.
Use a piece of aluminum foil or wax paper on the baking sheet to keep the erasers from sticking.
Make sure children have adult supervision during this step.
 If the instructions for your eraser clay say to let them set using boiling water, pour water into a pot and place it on the stove. Set the water to boil, then place your eraser designs into the boiling water for a few minutes.


Make sure you have enough water in the pot to completely cover your eraser clay designs.
For most eraser clay that uses this method, leave the erasers in the boiling water for 5 minutes, then turn off the burner and allow them to sit in the water as it cools.Remove the erasers from the water safely using a slotted spoon and set them to dry on a paper towel or napkin. Use caution and have an adult present for this entire step.
 After setting in the oven or on the stove, let your erasers cool for a couple of hours. Then enjoy using your personalized erasers to remove any pencil marks.


Test your erasers out when they’ve cooled down. If they are too soft, you may need to set them for longer. If they are too hard, you may need to try again and set them for less time. If they are too brittle, you may want to try again with thicker shapes.
Store your erasers in a container that seals tightly to make your erasers last as long as possible. They may become too dry and brittle for proper use if exposed to the air over a long period of time.

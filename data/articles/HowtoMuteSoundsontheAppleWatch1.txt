 Tap your Watch's face once, then tap it once again. Enter your pin.;
, A menu will appear with options including connectivity, airplane mode, mute, Do Not Disturb mode, theater mode and two modes that will help you look for and remotely lock your iPhone from your Watch.
 This is a mute feature that will silence all bells and whistles without affecting the haptic feedback (if you have that turned on).


Haptic feedback (vibration patterns felt on your wrist) can be turned off or on with your Watch and/or Watch app on your paired iPhone.
 You can tap the bell once more to turn sound on again. Your sounds will be back on when the button isn't lit in the purplish hue.
 With watchOS 3.2, Apple included the ability to adjust the volume inside of Settings.


Open up the Settings app/tool, tap "Sounds & Haptics", look under the "Alert Volume" setting for the slider control. Press the volume up or volume down button as desired; then you can turn your digital crown towards you to turn the volume down, or away from you to turn the volume up, to more accurately represent the volume you'd like to use.
Right underneath this, you'll also find a second switch for Silent Mode. This on/off setting works the same as the quick action menu one and synchronizes with it.

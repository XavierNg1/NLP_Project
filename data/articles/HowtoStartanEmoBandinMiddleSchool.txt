 You can't start an emo band unless you know emo music. First of all, the following bands are emo: Rites of Spring, Embrace, The Hated, Sunny Day Real Estate, Dashboard Confessional, My Chemical Romance, Senses Fail, Jimmy Eat World, I Hate Myself, Saetia, American Football, Texas is the Reason, Matchbook Romance, Silverstein, Evanescence, etc.;
, This goes without saying. You can play guitar, bass, drums or sing, whichever one you are good at.
 Make sure they want to be in an emo band. It wouldn't be too good if they all showed up for practice and wanted to play hardcore punk now would it? Also try to get friends at the same musical level as each other, for it will help you develop as a band.
 Try to make sure your whole band agrees on it. The name should be 2-4 words long. A good name will have your listeners thinking (e.g. The Academy Is... "What is the academy?"; Jimmy Eat World "What in god's name could that mean?") Also do not use an emo band name generator. Those are made by people who only wish they had enough talent to start a band.
 This really can't be stressed enough. Find a garage or something and practice, practice, practice!

, It helps to write the songs together, collaboration never hurts. Your songs should be emotional and should derive from styles like post-hardcore, indie, alternative or even pop punk or hardcore.
 Most people will want to hear you.
 They will help you get noticed more widely. Back in the day Myspace was a good bet but now be prepared with Facebook, Twitter, and/or Instagram.

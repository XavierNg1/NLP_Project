 Maintaining small talk is key to keeping a relationship accessible. Not every conversation is centered around deep connection and emotion when face to face and neither does it have to be when facing distance. With so many devices and messaging apps there is hardly an excuse!Try and check in daily to see what theyâ€™re up to.
Ask about daily routines and activities, like their commute to work, someone they met at school, or what they had for lunch.
 This is especially important if you are living in different time zones, as they can make rescheduling even more difficult. Following through with your plans to communicate, even when inconvenient, will help strengthen your relationship and maintain your connection.There will be lapses in communication. Try and be forgiving and understanding, and do your best to move forward.
 There are many activities that can be mutually enjoyed even though you are not in the same location. Finding things to do together will help maintain a bond and can also be a form of quality time.Watch the same shows at the same time and have a conversation about them afterward.
Start reading a book together.
 Communication can easily become less meaningful by constantly having access to messaging applications and devices. Reach out and attempt to make meaningful connection rather than liking a photo or writing a small post.


Remember to try to schedule meaningful routine conversations.

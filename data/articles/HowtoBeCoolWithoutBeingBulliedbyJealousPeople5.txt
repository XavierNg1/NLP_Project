 Consider your parents, school guidance counselor, principal, or someone else who can punish the bully and protect your safety. It's important that you talk to someone about your problem to get it to end. Do not worry about revenge that the bully may take if you report the incident; they will hurt you anyway and appeasing them doesn't solve your problem.


If there is a bullying survey in your school, always write your name down. Do not be embarrassed. You will probably start to talk to someone who is very experienced and this can be surprisingly helpful. You might want to talk to your Mom, Dad or guardian too. Remember: Never be embarrassed by your situation. You are a normal and good person and you're equal to everyone else.
 It is always better to use the bully's strength against them, rather than to attack. Should you need to fight, do so with all your strength, not half-heartedly. The defense courses will teach you to do this. There are many martial arts to choose from--pick yours and learn.


A quick kick in the groin will make the person feel dazed and look embarrassed long enough for an escape. Bullies aren't always used to others getting the best of them.






If the bully is grabbing you or pushing you, it's actually an advantage. Try real hard to keep your balance. Grab one of his or her arms with your left hand and hit his or her elbow with the other. Then, using your left hand, push away the remaining arms.






If the groin doesn't work, try the solar plexus (right below the ribs), or kick a knee to make the person trip.






Run and call for help.

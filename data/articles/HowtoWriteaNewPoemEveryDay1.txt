 You can motivate yourself to write a new poem a day by selecting a certain time of day for writing. You may set aside time early in the morning before you head to work or time at night after dinner, before bed. Try to pick a certain time and stick to it so you have enough time and focus to complete one new poem a day.For example, you may decide to write the poem early in the morning, from 7 am to 8 am. Giving yourself an hour time limit may help you get your words down on paper. Sticking to a consistent writing time every day will allow you to get into a routine and make it easier to get the poem done.;
, You should try to create a space that is suitable for writing so you are motivated to write one new poem a day. Look for a space in your home that is quiet and isolated from others so you can focus on your writing. You may also try to find a quiet, private space at school or at work and make this area your unofficial writing spot.For example, you may find a quiet spot in your school library and use this area as your writing spot. Or you may come into the office one hour earlier than everyone else so you can write a poem at your desk.
 You can stay focused on your writing by getting rid of any distractions in your writing space. This may mean shutting your bedroom door or your office door. You may also let others around you know that you are writing for a set period of time and are not to be disturbed. This can help you stay focused and get your one poem a day done.You should also limit any distractions by switching off your phone or putting it on mute while you are writing. You may also disconnect your computer from the internet so you are not distracted by the web.

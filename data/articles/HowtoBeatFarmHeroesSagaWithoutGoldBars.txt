 You are given five lives maximum at a time. The number of lives you have is indicated inside the heart icon on the top left part of the header. A countdown timer is displayed right beside it. It indicates the amount of time needed to replenish a life.;
, If you cannot wait, you have two options to resume playing. One is buying a full set of lives for 12 Gold Bars, and the other is to ask you friends. The latter option won’t cost you any money. The game is integrated with your Facebook account, and all your friends who play the game can be asked for lives.


Once you see the “No more lives” screen, tap or click the “Ask friends” button, and select the friends you want to ask lives from by ticking on their names. You can ask from only a few or from all of them.
Once you’ve selected friends, tap or click the “Send” button to trigger your request. Once your friends respond, you will get the lives they give you.
 It takes 15 minutes to replenish a life. If you’ve already used up all your five lives, you will have to wait 75 minutes to get your full set of five lives. Leave the game for a moment, and do some other stuff. When the required time has passed, you can resume playing with your new set of lives.
 You can trick the game into thinking that the required time has passed so that it will automatically replenish your lives. Go to your device’s clock settings, and set the time to something in the future or at least 75 minutes ahead. Once done, restart the game. Don’t forget to set your clock back to the correct time after doing so., Open Farm Heroes Saga online through Facebook or the Farm Heroes Saga app on your tablet or smartphone.
 You will be given rewards on a daily basis upon login. The daily rewards come as a seed garden, and this will appear on your first login of the day.
 To get your bonus, tap or click the “Collect” button. The rewards vary though. Most days, you may get Magic Beans in varying amounts. If you’re lucky, you’ll get boosters. If you got a booster, it will be added to your available boosters.
 Every 25 days, the Daily Bonus garden will be refreshed, so if you’re patient and collect each day, you may be able to collect boosters without spending a single gold bar.


Because the rate of getting boosters as bonuses can be low, use them wisely.
 Like most of King’s games, there will be some gates or roadblocks after a certain portion of levels. These gates or roadblocks prevent you from continuing with the next levels without first unlocking them. Continue playing the game until you reach such gates or roadblocks. The first one will appear at level 40.


Once you’re there, you will be given several options to proceed. There’s an option to pay your way with real money or with 9 Gold Bars, which will make it really easy and quick. However, if you don’t want to spend on the game, you may want to do some of the following steps.
 Since the game is linked to your Facebook account, you can ask your friends who play the game to help you out, similar to asking for lives. On the Roadblock screen, tap or click the “Ask friends” button. Select the friends you wish to request from, then tap or click the “Send” button. Select as many as you can so that you can unlock the next levels faster.
 If you don’t want to bug your friends, you can wait four days for the roadblock to get cleared automatically. Of course, this means you won’t be able to play for the next four days.
 You can do the same trick of cheating the clock. Go to your device’s clock settings and set the time to four or five days ahead. Once done, restart the game. The game will think the appropriate amount of time has passed, and the roadblock will get cleared.


Don’t forget to set your clock back to the correct time after doing so.

 Rayon thread is an all-around great choice for machine embroidery because it is strong, has a nice sheen, and you can use it with high speed stitching.You may want to use this thread if you are new to machine embroidery and/or want a high performance thread for your project.
 Polyester is a lot like rayon thread in the way it looks and performs. However, polyester thread holds up best against frequent washing and even when using bleach.Polyester is also less likely to break while sewing with it than rayon thread., Cotton is also an option for machine embroidery. It is not as shiny as rayon or polyester, but it performs well and it has a light shine to it. Cotton thread is also available in an ultra-fine 100 weight. However, such a fine strand will be prone to breaking, so it is best to choose 30 or 40 weight thread., You can also get silk thread for machine embroidery, which will give your project a high sheen and it will also feel nice and smooth. Silk thread also performs well for machine embroidery. Go for a 30 to 50 weight thread for best results., If you want your project to have the appearance of silver, gold, or bronze, then choosing a metallic or mylar thread may be the best choice. For example, you could embroider a gold star on a garment as an accent, or use metallic thread to embroider someone’s name or initials.


However, keep in mind that metallic and mylar threads can be difficult to work with. You will need to adjust your machine’s tension and go at a slower speed while working with these threads., There are also special effect threads to choose from. Embroidery floss comes in neon colors, glow-in-the-dark, and even color changing threads that change in the sunlight.If you want to add an interesting touch to your project, consider using one of these threads.


For example, you could embroider the moon in your project using glow-in-the-dark thread, or use color changing thread to embroider initials on a shirt.

 Use a large makeup brush to sweep a little bronzer along the bridge of your nose and across the top of your cheeks, along the cheekbone.Bronzer provides your skin with a slightly darker base for applying the fake freckles. Since real freckles are brought about by sun exposure, it makes sense to have slightly tanned skin beneath those freckles.


You do not need to sweep bronzer across your entire face. Doing so can make your overall skin tone look unnaturally dark.
Use a matte bronzer instead of a shimmery one for a more natural appearance.
 As a general rule, go for an eyebrow pencil that is two shades lighter than one you might use for your actual eyebrows. An eyebrow pencil is drier than most liners and do not turn out as dark, which is what you actually want for this look.
 Make sure that the pencil point is sharp before you start. Use the pencil to create small, light dots across the bridge of your nose and the tops of your cheeks, where you applied the bronzer.


Keep the freckles tight around the tops of the nose and directly under your eyes. Spread them out a little more as they go further down.
Make the freckles small, but not completely equal in size. They should vary slightly, with some being a little bigger than others, and they should not be obviously patterned or symmetrical.
 Stand back and check the way your freckles look in the mirror. Take the opportunity to add more dots, where necessary, to fill in any unnatural gaps. If necessary, pat the freckles with your fingertips or a small piece of cotton to soften them slightly.
 For dramatic freckles, do not use foundation. If the pencil you used was too dark, however, or you want to make your freckles look more subtle, lightly brush a powder foundation on top.


Do not use a liquid foundation since it will cause your faux freckles to smear and rub away.

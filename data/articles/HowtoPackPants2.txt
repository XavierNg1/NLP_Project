 Fabrics that donâ€™t wrinkle easily can be rolled. It's a quick, easy way to pack pants that you don't mind getting a little more wrinkled. Rolling items will give you more storage space in your suitcase, since rolled items take up less room than folded items. Here are the types of pants you can roll:


Jeans
Leggings
Workout pants

, Start with ironed pants if you want to keep them as wrinkle-free as possible. Lay them out and smooth your hands over the legs to remove any creases.
 Place one leg over the other leg to fold them perfectly in half. Smooth out the creases with your hands. Make sure there are no places where the fabric is rumpled.
 Use your fingers to start rolling the pants down from the waist, as you would roll up a jelly roll or sleeping bag. Keep rolling until you reach the cuffs. Your pants will end up in a neat roll that you can easily tuck into your suitcase.


As you roll, make sure the fabric stays crease-free. Smooth out creases as you go.
Roll loosely, rather than tightly, as tightly-rolled fabric will end up creasing.

, Recycle scrap fabric from a favorite old garment.
 Bring your miniskirt, fabric, common pins and matching thread to the sewing machine.



Cut your fabric three to five inches in width. Three inches will result in a one-inch ruffle. Five inches will result in a three-inch ruffle. These measurements are fairly approximate.
Cut the length of your fabric one and a half to two times the width of your miniskirt. One and a half in length will create a slightly gathered ruffle. Two times in length will create more gathers.



Place pleats equidistantly across the top of the length of the fabric. Fold fabric over once to create a pleat. Hold each pleat in place with a common pin.

Gather the ruffle. Place a loose running stitch along the top of the length of the fabric. Pull on the thread to gather the fabric.



Stitch the three remaining edges of the ruffle. Turn the fabric over twice to create a quarter-inch hemline.
When you pin the ruffle to the hemline of your miniskirt, bring the two ends of the ruffle together to form an open slit.

Place the slit to the side of the skirt. Align the slit with the side seam of your miniskirt.
Place the slit at the center of the back of the miniskirt.
 Using scissors, cut the hem off your miniskirt. Sew the two pieces together, leaving a half-inch seam allowance.
 Iron the inner seam allowance towards the waistband of your miniskirt.

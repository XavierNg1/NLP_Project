 The congkak board consists of two rows of seven holes called the houses and two bigger holes called the storehouse or home. Each player uses the side of the board that is closest to him or her. Each player starts the game with seven shells in his or her houses., The object of the Congkak is to move your shells into the storehouse that is situated on your left-hand side. You move your shells by picking up all of the shells in one of your houses and depositing one into each of the houses to the left of the space. The first person to empty all of his or her houses is the winner.You may also put one shell into your storehouse, but do not put any shells into your opponent’s storehouse.
If you drop a shell into an empty house that you own, then you get to take all of the shells from your opponent’s house that is across from your house and put them into your storehouse.
 Place the Congkak board on a level playing surface between you and your opponent. You should each have 49 shells or Congkak seeds each. Before the game starts fill your seven houses with seven shells or Congkak seeds. Make sure that your opponent does the same. Both of you should leave your storehouses empty., Take a moment to decide who will take the first turn. You can determine who will go first by flipping a coin, allowing the youngest player to go first, or letting the person who won the last game you played together go first.

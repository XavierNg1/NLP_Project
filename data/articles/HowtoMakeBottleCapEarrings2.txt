 Make sure that they are clean. If they are dirty, wash them using soap and warm water. Pat them dry using a paper towel.
 The best place to work on would be a slab or wood or an old cutting board. The underside of the bottle cap should be facing you.
 Hit the head of the nail with a hammer. You will be punching the hole from the inside.
 The flat head part of the pin should be inside the cap. You can find these types of pins in the beading section of an arts and crafts store. They are long, and easily bent., You won't need a lot of beads. One to three small beads will do. Choose colors that match the design on your bottle cap. Here are some ideas to get you started:


If you are adding one bead, match it to the background color of the bottle cap, or the letters.
If you are using 2 beads, match the bottom one to the letters, and the top one to the background.
If you are using three beads, match the top and bottom beads to the background. Match the middle bead to the letters.
 Use your jewelry pliers to take hold of the shaft, as close to the beads/bottle cap as possible. Bend the shaft until it is at a 90 degree angle.
 Use your wire cutters to do this.
 Grip the very end of the shaft with a par of round-nose jewelry pliers. Twist the shaft into a loop. Don't close it all the way.
 If you are having troubles getting the loop closed all the way, try pulling it a little bit towards you, and pulling it until it meets the shaft. Then, push the loop back towards the shaft to flatten it, soft of like closing a jump ring.
 If you are using beads, make sure that they match your first earring.

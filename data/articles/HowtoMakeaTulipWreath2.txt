 Get a ribbon in a color that compliments your tulips' colors. Secure the end of your wreath to your Styrofoam using a floral pin. Wrap it around the Styrofoam wreath frame so that all the white is colored. Then, use a floral pin to secure the other end of the ribbon to the wreath.Wrap your ribbon snugly and overlap each layer a little bit. This will most effectively cover your wreath.
 Take your tulips and use floral pins to pin their stems onto your wreath. Overlap new stems with previous stems as you go. This will cover up the appearance of stems, leaving the focus on the flowers instead. To start, make one layer covering the outer portion of your wreath., Once the outer portion of the wreath is covered, cover the inner portion of the wreath. Repeat the same pattern. Pin tulips down by the stems. Then, add new stems to overlap with the old ones. This will put the focus on the flowers., After covering the inner and outer layers of the wreath, evaluate it. If you notice any holes where you can see the ribbon poking through, cover these with another tulip.It's not always necessary to fill in holes. If your wreath does not have any obvious holes, or if you simply prefer the look of the ribbon poking through, you can skip this step.
 Some buds usually break away from the stem while you're making your wreath. Use hot glue to reattach these tulips to the wreath.Make sure to add the glue to the tulips near the base of the flowers. You do not want glue to show up on your wreath.
 Cut out a piece of ribbon to use as the hanger. The size is up to you depending on how big you want your hanger to be. Then, use floral pins to attach either end of the ribbon to the back of your wreath.When you're done, you should have a thick tulip wreath with a hanger in place that you can hang up on your wall.

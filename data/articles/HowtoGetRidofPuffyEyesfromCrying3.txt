 Many people place a cold, wet tea bag over puffy eyes. This works simply because of the cold temperature. Different practitioners swear by black tea, green tea, or various herbal varieties. Many of these have not been studied, but caffeine — the ingredient most likely to work — seems to have no effect.A washcloth is probably just as effective and has a lower risk of bacterial infection.
 Cucumber slices are one of the most common treatments for puffy eyes. This is effective, but only because of the cucumber's cool temperature. It's best to use a cold washcloth or ice pack to reduce the chance of bacterial infection from food.


If you do use a food treatment, rinsed cucumber is probably one of the safest. Stay away from potatoes, egg whites, yogurt, and acidic food such as strawberries or lemon juice.
 Some home remedies are dangerous to use around your eyes, due to the risk of severe pain or damage. Do not treat puffy eyes with hemorrhoid cream (Preparation H), heat rubs (BenGay, Icy Hot), or hydrocortisone.

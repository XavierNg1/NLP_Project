 Modern TVs and many modern computers are equipped with HDMI ports and connecting the two is simply a matter of having the right cable.


Take note of the port number labeled on the TV.


If your computer doesn't have an HDMI port, you can obtain a DVI to HDMI or a VGA to HDMI adapter. With VGA, you will need a separate audio cable.
, It's a button on the remote or on the TV itself and is typically labeled "Input" or "Source.",

If you don't see video, check your computer's video output/monitor settings and make sure that HDMI, or the port to which the adapter is connected, is selected.
If you don't hear any sound: (1) Make sure the volume is up and mute is off on both the TV and your computer; and (2) Check your computer audio output or sound settings to make sure that the output is set to the headphone jack.

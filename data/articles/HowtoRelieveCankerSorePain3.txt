 Ice can be an effective, easy way to relieve the pain of a canker sore. To use ice on a canker sore, take an ice cube or ice chip and let it melt onto the sore. Repeat as needed. The cold will numb the area and provide some relief from the pain., You can rinse your mouth with saltwater to help ease the pain of a canker sore. To use a saltwater rinse, mix ½- 1 teaspoon of sea salt (or table salt) with ¼ cup of warm water. The salt will dissolve better in warm water. Swish the solution in your mouth and use about three times per day., A steeped herbal tea bag may also provide some temporary relief of pain from a canker sore. To use a steeped tea bag, let an herbal tea bag soak in warm water for about five minutes. You do not need to fill the cup all the way. You just need to use enough water to soak the tea bag. Then, remove the bag from the water and place the tea bag directly onto the canker sore. Leave the tea bag in place for at least 10-15 minutes. Repeat this four to five times per day. Try using one of the following herbs:Licorice root
Goldenseal root
Sage leaves
Chamomile
Peppermint
Cloves

, If you don’t have the tea bags and prefer to use dry herbs, take ½-1 teaspoon of any of dried herbs and mix with 1 – 2 tablespoons of coconut oil. Use just enough to make a thick paste. Apply the paste directly onto the canker sore. Repeat this process four to five times per day. If you swallow some, don’t worry. These herbs are safe for ingestion. Try using one of the following herbs:Licorice root
Goldenseal root
Sage leaves
Chamomile
Peppermint

Mix two to four drops of essential oil with 10 – 15 drops of coconut oil. Apply the mixture to the canker sore using a cotton ball or a q-tip. Repeat this process four to five times per day. You can use more than one type of essential oil, just keep the total number of drops under four. Choose from the following essential oils to make your mixture:Peppermint
Clove

 Many will turn mushy but should retain the flavor provided you are prepared to use them for food such as soups, stews, baked goods and the like, rather than for salads or garnishes.


Note that not everyone agrees that herbs can be frozen at all. Some chefs believe it ruins the herbs and should be avoided.On the other hand, others believe it is just fine to freeze herbs.It is recommended that you try it for yourself as an experiment to see whether or not the results work for you.
Herbs thought to be amenable to freezing include: chives, chervil, dill, fennel leaves, parsley and tarragon.Herbs that don't dry well are better frozen (for example, chives, basil, chervil, cilantro and dill.
Keep in mind that some herbs may be better dried than frozen. For example, rosemary will dry really simply without much ado and retains its flavor for a long time.
 The idea is to get them before too many of the oils have evaporated in the heat of the sun but after they're free of the morning dew. However, the need to pick them before the sun has heated them may depend on where you live; if your sunshine isn't too fierce, any time of the day may be appropriate.


The reason to avoid picking herbs that are damp is that they can mildew easily. For the purposes of freezing, it's just more water you need to get rid of.
 Herbs should be free of dirt, insects and any other plant matter. If needed, wash dirty herbs gently but thoroughly and allow to dry completely before freezing. If you know the herbs are from a clean source and can get away with just brushing them or wiping them, this is preferable to washing them too much.


If you have washed the herbs, leave on absorbent paper to soak up moisture, then pat dry.
 Aim to use frozen herbs within two months, to avoid loss of flavor. Herbs kept frozen any longer than this may taste bland or even unpleasant, depending on the type of herb.

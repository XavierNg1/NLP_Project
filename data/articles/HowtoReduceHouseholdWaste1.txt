 You've probably heard the saying, "quality not quantity." That adage applies when you're trying to reduce household waste. Buying higher quality items, including dishes, pans, clothing, toys, and most everything else, will reduce your waste overall because the items will last longer. You won't need to replace them as often.For instance, when you can, spring for the higher quality pot. It's more expensive, but it will last many more years.;
, When purchasing items like food, choose bigger packages over smaller to help reduce trash from packaging. For instance, a large box of cereal creates less waste than several smaller boxes of cereal that add up to the same amount.If you prefer individual servings, portion the food out into reusable containers when you get home. For instance, if you like small portions of pretzels, buy a big bag and then use small sealed containers to create individual portions.
Also, be sure to look for packaging that can be recycled, so you aren't contributing to the landfill.
 Today's society has bought into excessive packaging. Some items have two or three layers of packaging. If you see an item that seems to have an excessive amount of packaging, try looking for a different brand to see if it uses less., Bulk bins are becoming more popular, particularly in health food stores. With these bins, you simply scoop out the food (such as rice, flour, sugar, etc.) into a bag, which usually produces less waste than standard packaging. However, you can also bring reusable containers from home to make the purchase even greener.

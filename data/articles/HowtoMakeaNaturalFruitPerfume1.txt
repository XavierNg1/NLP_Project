 For this recipe, you will need the following items: 1 organic cinnamon stick, 25 organic cardamom pods, 15 organic cloves, 1 organic vanilla bean, 1 fresh organic orange peel (zest only) and 8 ounces of vodka.Cut the vanilla bean into small pieces using a sharp knife.
Zest the orange peel by rubbing the peel over a cheese grater. When you reach the white portion of the rind, stop grating and move on to another portion of the peel.;
, Using a mortar and pestle, crush the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods and cloves until they have reached a fine powder. Use your hand to cover the spices so they don't ricochet out of the mortar and onto the floor.When the spices are fairly crushed, stir the pestle around the spices to crush them into an even finer powder.
If you prefer not to use your hand, you can also cover the mortar with a wet paper towel to prevent spillage.
 Combine the crushed spices, vanilla bean pieces, orange peel zest and alcohol in a glass mason jar. Cap the jar and shake the jar before storing the jar in a cool, dark place.Shake the jar once or twice a day to resettle the ingredients.
Allow the jar to sit for between 2 â€“ 6 weeks.
 After 2-6 weeks, strain the mixture either in a colander or by using a teapot strainer. Pour the perfume mixture into a glass bottle with a top, and apply the mixture to the inside of your wrists and behind your ears.In addition to smelling good, this perfume should help alleviate stress, mental fatigue and tension.
For a stronger smelling perfume, add additional spices.

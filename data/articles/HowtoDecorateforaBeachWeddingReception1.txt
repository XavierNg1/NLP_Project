 While any colors that the bride and groom like are appropriate, most beach wedding receptions feature light colors that mimic the beach, water, sun and seashells.


Select a deep ocean blue or navy blue. A deep blue is reminiscent of the sea. It can be paired with natural colors like brown and tan, or bright colors like sliver. The natural brown tones mimic the sand, while silver adds an elegant pop of color.
Choose coral, fuchsia and orange colors. These bright colors complement the sunset and stand out among the muted shades of the natural beach. This color scheme draws attention to the decorative accents of the wedding reception.
Consider aqua and orange. The aqua color complements the blue waters, while the orange is reminiscent of the sunset. This color combination can be used for a playful and casual reception or an elegant and romantic reception.
Select beige and pink. The beige tones mimic the sand, while the pink adds a soft glow of color. The pink tones can vary from a bright honeysuckle pink to a muted powdery pink. The beige and pink color combination blends in with the beach setting, and provide a warm, romantic color palette.
Choose yellow, orange and red. This color combination is reminiscent of the sunset. Choose yellow as the main color and then complement it with orange and red hues. This color palette is appropriate for casual daytime receptions, but also serves as an elegant choice for evening beach receptions.
Consider orange and lime green. This color palette is popular because the orange mimics the sunset and the green is reminiscent of natural foliage. The combination is especially appropriate for the summer, when plants near the beach are in bloom.;

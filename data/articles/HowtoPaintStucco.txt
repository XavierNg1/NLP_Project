 The stucco needs at least 60 days to settle and dry completely.;
, Look for any areas that are peeling or staining. You may want to mark these areas since they will need extra attention when you are painting over them.
 This will remove dust and dirt and also remove any loose paint from previous paint jobs.


Set the washer to use low pressure (1200 to 1500 psi) and use a wide spray tip.
Distance the spray tip approximately 12 inches (30 cm) away from the stucco exterior to give it a light and even wash.
Wash from top to bottom when working on a vertical surface such as a wall.
Angle your spray away from window and door frames to prevent water from entering the frames and causing damage.
, You can use caulk for small hairline cracks but will need to fill the larger cracks with a thick sealant since it will hold its place more firmly.
, You should consider the following points when selecting masonry paint.


Color: of course the paint should match the color you want.
Flexibility: the paint should be able to stretch to adjust to temperature changes.
Dirt and mildew resistance: to minimize cleaning and maintenance requirements.

A lamb's wool roller is ideal because it holds its shape without splatters.
Use 1 inch (2.5 cm) nap thickness if the stucco surface is smooth. For rougher surfaces the nap thickness should be 1.5 inches (3.8 cm).
Apply 2 coats to give a thick film of paint and fill more pores.



Paint the border areas around windows and doors that the roller was unable to reach. You can paint with much more detail when using a brush.
Cover the deeper pores in the stucco using the paintbrush. The brush can reach the deeper areas that the roller could not.

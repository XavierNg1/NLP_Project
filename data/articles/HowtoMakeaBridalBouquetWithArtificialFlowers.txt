 Decide on the color palette you want and purchase artificial flowers that match their natural counterparts, which will create a more realistic looking arrangement. Choose a bouquet holder carefully, since this will be the foundation for your handmade wedding bouquet.;
, Trim a sheet or block of foam with a razor knife to fit inside any bouquet holder.
 Insert the stem of the flower into the floral foam. Pin flowers that do not have stems into the foam. Place greenery or accents around the focal flowers. Continue adding other flowers around the main ones in the pattern of your choice, sticking in or pinning greenery or accents around them.
 Fill in all bare spots and go all the way to the edge of the bouquet holder with the artificial flowers and accents for a full look.
 Wrap the rest of the ribbon up the entire length of the holder and hot glue the top ribbon in place. Trim off any extra ribbon.
 Place a few drops of glue underneath the ribbon and secure firmly around the holder so that there are no creases. Tie the remaining ribbon tightly into a bow, leaving some excess ribbon flowing down the holder.
 Enhance your finished artificial flower wedding bouquet with floral sprays, such as glitter or scented sprays if desired.

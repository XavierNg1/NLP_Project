 Sometimes, more than one element can combine to form an ion, which can then bond with a different ion to form a compound. For example, OH−1{\displaystyle OH^{-1}} is a polyatomic ion made from oxygen and hydrogen ions.Each polyatomic ion has its own special name. OH−1{\displaystyle OH^{-1}} is called "hydroxide."


OH−1{\displaystyle OH^{-1}} is not an ionic compound, because it does not have a net charge of zero. It is a single ion, which can combine with ions of the opposite charge.

Some elements can form polyatomic ions by themselves. For example, "peroxide" is the O22−{\displaystyle O_{2}^{2-}} ion. It contains two oxygen atoms, but has a total charge of -2. (This is different than oxide, the "standard" oxygen ion, which has one atom with a charge of -2.)


, The second word in the ionic compound's name refers to the polyatomic ion. Look up this word (not the full compound name) to find the formula for this polyatomic ion. You can also memorize a few common polyatomic ions:Cyanide: CN−{\displaystyle CN^{-}} (One carbon, one nitrogen, total charge of -1)

Hydroxide: OH−{\displaystyle OH^{-}}.

Nitrate: NO3−{\displaystyle NO_{3}^{-}} (One nitrogen, three oxygen, total charge of -1)

Nitrite: NO2−{\displaystyle NO_{2}^{-}}

Peroxide: O22−{\displaystyle O_{2}^{2-}}

Sulfate: SO42−{\displaystyle SO_{4}^{2-}}

Sulfite: SO32−{\displaystyle SO_{3}^{2-}}


, The other ion in the compound is usually a simpler, one-atom ion. You can find its charge the same way you would in any problem.

For example, magnesium hydroxide contains a magnesium cation. Magnesium is a group 2 element that forms the ion Mg2+{\displaystyle Mg^{2+}}.
 All ionic compounds have a total net charge of zero. Find the minimum number of positive and negative ions that balance each other's charges perfectly. Remember that the polyatomic ion is a single ion, and cannot be divided into parts.

For example, to balance OH−1{\displaystyle OH^{-1}} and Mg2+{\displaystyle Mg^{2+}} , compare the charges. It takes two -1 charges to balance out one 2+ charge. This means there are two hydroxide ions and one magnesium ion.
 To show that there are multiply polyatomic ions, enclose that section of the formula in parentheses. Write the subscript showing the number of atoms after the close parenthesis.

For example, magnesium hydroxide has the chemical formula Mg(OH)2{\displaystyle Mg(OH)_{2}}.

You do not need to include the charges of the ions.

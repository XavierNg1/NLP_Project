 If your parents don't want you to do something, try to think about why they don't want you to. They often have good reasons that you may not understand at first. Maybe they've done something similar and don't want you to learn the hard way.;
, If a parent has a differing point of view, don't argue with them. Talk logically, and perhaps one of you will decide the other is right.
 Instead, listen to their points of view and calmly state your own. If they get angry, don't let the conversation evolve into a shouting match. If your parents say that they are right and you are wrong, respect their decision. If you do not agree, however, please don't force yourself. You have a right to your own opinions, and obeying your parents is not your duty. But doing it is worth it!

, If a parent says that you have to go to bed at a certain time, do it. If they tell you you absolutely must not do something, don't do it. It's not worth the severe drop in trust levels you will experience.
 Pay attention to how this friend behaves: Do they do drugs? Skip school? Are they a good role model for you?

, They aren't demons trying to take away all your fun - they often have good reasons for what they do. Treat your parents like human beings and they will treat you like one too.

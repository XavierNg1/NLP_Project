 Another way to watch YouTube videos in slow motion is to use an external site with a slow motion feature. This is a good choice if you can't get the standard slow motion method above to work. There are many different sites that will allow you to do this, but Rowvid.com is a particularly good all-around choice.This section will use RowVid for example purposes.


Another great choice is the aptly-named Youtubeslow.com.One big advantage of Youtubeslow.com is that it works on mobile devices.
 On the main Rowvid screen, you'll see a text box in the center of the screen. Find the URL of the YouTube video you want to slow down, copy it to the clipboard, and paste it into this box. Click "Watch Video" to proceed.


On a Windows PC, the keyboard shortcut for copying text is Ctrl+C and the shortcut for pasting is Ctrl+V. For Macs, use Command+C and Command+V.
 On the next screen, you will see the YouTube video you've chosen load into a large player. The video will start playing automatically, but you can pause it by clicking the video as normal. Below this, you'll see various options for adjusting the speed of the video.


Clicking 0.25 and 0.5 will change the speed to quarter or half speed. 1 will change the speed to normal.
Note that you may be directed to youtube.com/html5 to change your browser settings when you try to adjust the video speed.
 One option that RowVid has that the standard YouTube player doesn't is the ability to go through a video one frame at a time. Use the > button in the bottom left to move one frame forward and use < to move one frame backward. The player will pause automatically when you click either of these options.

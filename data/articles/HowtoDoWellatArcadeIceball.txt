 Bend over low enough so you can reach the pocket of balls on the right, and you can just reach touch the surface of the "run way" with the tip of your middle finger, and make sure your throwing arm is lined up in the middle of the lane. Swing your arm back and forth if you wish to get a feel for it.


Without moving your back, grab a ball. Practice swing again if you want to.
Then roll it down the lane at a decent speed. Too fast and it will crash into the cage covering the holes. Too slow and it'll bounce out of the bottom circle resulting in 0 points.
It will take one or two tries to get used to rolling the ball. The slickness of the lane, the weight of the ball, and the flimsiness of the holes can affect how the ball will act, so adjust your throw accordingly.;
, You will hit it fairly often, and occasionally it will bounce up to the 4000 or even the 5000 hole, but it might bounce out but will be caught in the 2000 hole!

 When an unvaccinated dog comes into contact with rabies virus, it is more likely than not that he will contract the disease. The Center for Disease Control recommends euthanization or putting your dog down, as he is a threat to those around him if he does develop the disease


However, there are other options if you refuse to put your dog down. It is important though to keep in mind that if he begins to show symptoms of rabies, there will be no other option but to put him down, as hard as that may be.
 Rabies generally takes less than six months to incubate (or become apparent in your dog) so most vets will require that you quarantine your unvaccinated dog for six months to make sure that he is safe to interact with.More information about quarantining your dog is covered in Method 3.
 If you choose to put your dog into quarantine rather than euthanizing your dog, he will have to have to receive a booster shot and vaccination during that time. Both of these shots will attempt to stop the spread of the virus if the dog has indeed contracted it. However, if the booster and post-exposure vaccines do not work, your dog will have to be euthanized, as once the symptoms of rabies appear, there is nothing that can be done to stop the virus.


This combination is explained more thoroughly in Steps 3 and 5 of the previous Method.

 Here's what you'll need to make a simple poached salmon:









1 1/2 lbs. salmon
1 chopped sweet onion
1/2 cup dry white wine
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste;
, Place one diced sweet onion, 1/2 cup of dry white wine, and 1 cup of water in a skillet over medium-high heat and bring the mixture to a simmer.
 of salmon steaks in the frying pan. Add additional water if necessary so the salmon is submerged about halfway. Reduce the heat so the liquid is barely simmering.
 Cook the other side for an additional 4-5 minutes. If the salmon steaks are thin--between 1/2 and 1/3 inch--cooking time will be faster on each side, for about 3-4 minutes. Thicker steaks--1 to 1 1/2 inches--will take 8 to 12 minutes.
 Use a slotted spatula to do this carefully. Season the salmon to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve it while it's hot.

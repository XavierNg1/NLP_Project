 You can't unlock Kairos without being level 16 as his habitat only unlocks once you've reached that level.;
, It's the section of the market where you buy items that allows you to house a dragon.
 This is Kairos's habitat. This dragon cannot live on other habitats.
 This can be done by attaining artifacts. To get these artifacts, you can either enter a race for 50,000 gold or buy them with gems.


Each of the 3 stages in completing Kairos's perch consists of 7 artifacts; meaning, you'll have to gain 21 artifacts in total.
The prices of the artifacts will range from 75 to 300 gems.
 You'll see a stone slab with a plus (+) sign on it. Click on the plus sign and you'll be given a choice whether you want to race or buy an artifact piece.
 If you choose a dragon corresponding to the racetrack, you have a higher chance of winning it. Here are the dragons you can use for each race:


Blast Furnace: Forge dragon, Brass dragon
Cherry Road: Sakura dragon, Paper dragon
Dramoria: Steel dragon
Electric Skies: Sonic dragon, Butterfly dragon
Marshlands: Seaweed dragon, Swamp dragon
Rime or Reason: Snow dragon
Shimmering Fault line: Any gem dragon (i.e., Pearl, Ruby, etc.), Rainbow dragon, Gold dragon, Moon dragon, Leap Year dragon
Ulster Meadows: Tree dragon, Moss dragon, Clover dragon
Year of the Dragon Race: Panlong dragon, Rainbow dragon

, You'll have a chance to receive a piece of artifact; it's a bit hard to get them, so be really patient with this.
 You'll be taken to the second stage of the perch upgrade.


Collect the artifacts necessary for the second stage, and continue racing until you complete all three stages.
 You will now be able to summon Kairos.

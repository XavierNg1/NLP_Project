 If you find the rock outside of your house, make sure it is clean. Give it a quick soapy wash to remove dirt or bugs from it to ensure it's easy to paint on.;
,, Use acrylic paint instead of other types of paint because it lasts longer and provides a thicker coat of paint. It will make it easier than using dry-style paints when painting with a toothpick. You may also want to buy some clear paint.
 Have a cup of water handy to dip your toothpicks in for instant cleaning.
, Rocks will often have a lot of bumps and dents in them, so you need to smooth out the surface in readiness for painting. Paint a coat of white paint (with a paintbrush) onto the rock and let it dry. You will paint your designs on the white paint, so that the rock looks smooth and your painting will look much better.
 Use a soft-led pencil to sketch your design of the rock in place, if needed.
 Make sure you pick up a thick coating of paint.
 Just be sure to use a different toothpick for each new colour. Examples of what you can do include:


Drag the tip of the toothpick through the rock to mark a design of choice through the paint. That is a really good reason for painting with a toothpick, to carve a design through the paint.
Make dot art. Place many dots in a formation or pattern of choice. Change colours to form different parts of the design, such as brown paint to form a kangaroo's body, blue paint for its eyes and green paint for a plant next to the kangaroo.
Draw shapes, lines or letters. Or, draw a person, animal or object, all using the tip of the toothpick.
 Or, just use another new toothpick, so that the colours stay looking their best.
 This will lift off the paint, allowing you to begin again. You will need to be quick to do this though, as once the paint has dried, your only option is to repaint the rock white and begin again.
 This seals the paintwork in, helping to make it last longer. It will also cause the paintwork to glisten under light.

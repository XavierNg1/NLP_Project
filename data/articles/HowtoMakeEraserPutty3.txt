 For this method, you will two different types of eraser. The first is any standard solid rubber eraser you would like to turn into putty. This rubber eraser will make up the bulk of your final kneaded eraser, so pick one with a color you like. Softer rubber will make a better eraser putty. You will also need a "hi-polymer" vinyl eraser. It must be big enough that you can comfortably rub the first eraser against it. Only a small portion of this eraser will be in your final kneaded eraser, so its color doesn't matter as much as the rubber eraser's., Keep the vinyl eraser flat on your desk. Vigorously rub the rubber eraser over it. Use the same motions as you would to erase pencil, but press down harder., The friction between the two erasers will create eraser shavings. These will mostly be made up of the softer rubber eraser, which will wear down much faster. However, you will also notice a crater begin to form in the center of your vinyl eraser. Periodically sweep away the shavings from this crater and into one big pile nearby.


If you want a larger piece of eraser putty, you can always repeat this with multiple rubber erasers and combine the shavings together at the end., Scoop up the pile of eraser shavings into one hand. Make a fist to squeeze the shavings together into a clump. Roll the clump between your two hands. Keep squeezing and rolling the eraser clump until it forms a smooth, finished eraser putty.

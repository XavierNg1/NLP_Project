, Pat them dry with paper towels to get as much of the moisture out of the skin as possible so that it will become crispy and golden.
 Use any seasonings and oils you would like. Don’t forget to salt and pepper them.


For healthier chicken legs, lightly rub them with olive oil and then sprinkle salt, pepper and thyme on them.
For extra crispy legs, mix ½ cup of flour with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and any other herbs you’d like (season to taste). Rub the legs with butter or olive oil and then roll them in the flour mixture., Make sure they are not overlapping. Put them in the oven once it has reached its temperature.
 When the chicken is done, any juices will run clear. You can also stick a thermometer in the thickest part of the chicken leg. It should read 160°F (71°C).

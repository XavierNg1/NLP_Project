 Before going to bed, drink a glass of water, hot chocolate, or warm milk to get you comfortable. Have a midnight snack, as long as it's not chocolatey or sugary. This will keep you up!

, The earlier you go to bed, the easier it will be to get up early the next day. You should plan to get at least 8-12 hours of sleep every night. Staying up till midnight when you have to get up at 5:30 a.m. the next morning is not gonna fly.
 You can use this time to lay in bed and wake yourself up before you actually have to get out of bed (Turn on a light and press the snooze button so you won't fall back asleep).
 Getting up on the first ring will make you much less tired then sleeping another 5 minutes. This won't help. You're going to have to get up eventually, so you might as well not be late! If you must hit the snooze button, limit yourself to only 1 or 2 snoozes.;
, Quickly wash your face to get you a little more active. Splash cold/hot water in your face. Maybe even take a hot shower in the morning to wake up. Drink hot coffee or hot chocolate.
 Get dressed and brush your hair and teeth. Eat a big, healthy breakfast to get you ready for the day and make sure some lights are turned on. The dark may get you sleepy.
 Do a little dance, sing a song. Scream in a high pitch voice. It may sound crazy, but it works.

 Before you apply a wax or polish to your car, it’s important that it be completely clean. It’s also recommended that you work somewhere that’s not in direct sunlight, as this can make it harder for the wax to set properly.Speed the drying process along by going over the exterior with an absorbent chamois.Waxing a dirty car will just trap dirt and debris against the paint.
 Dab a small amount of wax onto a clean buffer pad and spread it over the area you’re waxing. Then, leave the wax to sit for a few minutes. As it dries, it will begin to grow cloudy, which is how you’ll know it’s time to wipe it off.Car waxes typically come in one of two forms: a liquid or a thick paste. Both types of wax can be applied using the same techniques.Wax should only be used on the painted areas of your vehicle’s exterior, not the windshield, wheels or other parts.
 Use a non-abrasive cloth, like a microfiber or terry cloth towel, to buff out the dried wax. Doing so will leave your car with a clear, polished shine. A coat of wax will also act as a defensive barrier that makes crushed bugs easier to wipe away in the future.Buff with short, circular strokes to avoid leaving streaks.For maximum efficiency, concentrate on a single section at a time until you’ve gone over your entire vehicle.
 The wax will begin to wear down and lose its effectiveness within a month. You can maintain your car’s armor by regularly applying a fresh coat of wax. Not only will this keep it looking good, it will also make it less likely to attract bugs and other roadway messes.If you dread the time and labor involved in waxing your vehicle yourself, consider taking it to have it done by a professional.

 Only your shield can be of any help against Blade Traps. Weapons are useless since you cannot hurt these kinds of enemies. Once you spot a Blade Trap, quickly have your shield ready at your side.;
, Blade Traps can only attack on one direction, which is why it’s commonly found near blocking doors or open passages. But it’s quite hard to tell which way a Blade Trap will move, so you need to approach it very slowly with your shield raised up.
 Once you come in range of its attack, the Blade Trap will swiftly attack. The attack is so quick that jumping out of its way is very hard, unless you can predict when the strike will come. If you have your shield raised, you should be spared from the damage the Blade Traps can deal.
 After the Blade Trap attacks, it will slowly go back to its original place in the room, which takes a considerable length of time. This gives you an opening to move across the room and pass the Blade Traps without getting hurt.

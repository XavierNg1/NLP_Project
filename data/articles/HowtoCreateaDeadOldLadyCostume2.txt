 The process of making your zombie costume may ruin elements of your costume for future use.
 You can use some creativity to decide how you want to look disheveled.


Tear your clothes, at the edges and in the body. You can start by cutting with scissors and then ripping the rest of the way.
Create tears in your stockings by stretching them. You can put 1 stocking up and 1 stocking down. Rub them with grass to create grass stains.
Put leaves in your wig or hair.
 You can find these at drugstores and dedicated Halloween shops. They may come with instructions on how to apply the makeup.
 You can also use a blow dryer to speed up the process.
 Take off small pieces of toilet paper from a roll and stick it on the liquid latex. Allow it to dry.


Cover it with another layer of liquid latex. Pick at the toilet paper to give a more uneven look.
 This should replace your regular colored liquid foundation in your old lady costume and create the look of a deathly pallor. Shop for the palest liquid foundation you can find, which will spread more easily than white face paint.


Include some foundation over your lips to make them look extra pale.
 Take a large powder brush and apply these shadows under your eyes, around your cheeks and around other bones on your neck, arms and legs. Blend the shadows together until you get the right look.
 Allow it to dry completely before going out. Fake blood can stick on furniture and clothing if it does not dry completely.

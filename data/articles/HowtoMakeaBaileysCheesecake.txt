 Measure everything out before you get startedâ€”it'll make the job easier and more fun.
 While you can always buy a pre-formed graham cracker pie shell, making it yourself is easy, and tastes way better!

Grease the inside of a springform pan. You can use vegetable oil, or softened butter (our preference).





Mix the crumbs and softened butter together until well blended, then press over the bottom and sides of the pan. Place the pan in the refrigerator to chill and set while you make the batter.
 Get this started now, so when you're cheesecake is assembled, it'll be ready to bake.
 This is where your inner chef gets to come out and play.

Combine the ricotta and cream cheese, beating well until smooth.






Fold in the remaining ingredients and continue beating until the mixture is smooth.
 Pour the cheesecake batter into the chilled crumb pan.
 Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

You may place a shallow pan of water in the oven under the cheesecake pan while baking to prevent cracking of the cheesecake.
 I know you'll be tempted, but let the cheesecake cool down for about 20 to 30 minutes in the pan.
 When the cheesecake has cooled, remove the cheesecake from the pan and let it finish cooling completely.,

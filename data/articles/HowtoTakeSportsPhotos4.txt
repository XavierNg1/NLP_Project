 When you think you’re getting great shots, you’ll be tempted to check your photos constantly. Every time you take your eyes from the action to your camera, you potentially miss a great photo opportunity. Only check your photos when the action is stopped, or wait until the game is totally over.Once you take a shot, the moment has passed anyway. You either got a great shot or you didn’t, and checking your photo immediately won’t change that.
Looking away from the action also poses a potential safety risk because you won’t see a ball or player coming at you. Keeping your eyes on the action keeps you safer.
 Look through all of your photos and sort through which are good and which aren’t. Learn to be critical of your shots and pick out specific ways that you could have improved each one of them. Do your best to implement your self criticism the next time you take photos.Thinking that all of your shots are perfect leaves you no room to grow as a photographer. Don’t be afraid to be overly critical so that you can find your weaknesses and improve them.
 After you have carefully sorted through your photos and picked the best ones, organize them in a way that tells the story of the game. Include the high points and the sad moments to fully capture the whole story.If you have to pick one photo, choose the one that reveals the most about the game or has the highest emotional value. With a spread, pick a variety of shots that encompass the game.

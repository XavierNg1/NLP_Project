 Often, your laptop will be set to "passive" cooling when on battery to reserve power. However, if you're often overheating, you may want to change that to active. Go to your power options, which is in the control panel. Click "Change power settings" under the plan you want to change. Click "Change advanced power settings."You may need to hunt a bit here. Look for titles such as "Processor power management" or "Power saver settings." Under those names, you should find a place to change your cooling to active.
 While it's not always feasible, try to work in places that aren't too hot. If you feel cool enough, it should be fine for your computer. You definitely shouldn't work in places above 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius) if possible.Having a fan turned towards your laptop can help., When you place your laptop on a soft surface, such as pillow or blanket, it has a harder time circulating air properly. Your laptop should be on a flat, hard surface, such as a table or desk. Make sure nothing is blocking the fan vent.If you must work on your lap, try using a laptop cooling pad or external fan.
 If you make your laptop work on overdrive all the time, it's going to stay hotter. Try switching to battery-saving mode to help decrease your energy consumption and keep your computer running cooler.Another way to lower your energy consumption is to simply unplug when you can, as many laptops automatically switch to a power-saver mode., When dust builds up in your fans and vents, they aren't as effective at cooling. To counteract that, you need to clean your fans from time to time. The easiest way is to turn off and unplug your computer. Puff air in the vents with canned air. Be sure to only use short puffs.You can also use cotton swabs to swab out dust.
Another option is a computer vacuum, which sucks out dust.

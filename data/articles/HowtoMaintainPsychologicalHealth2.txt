 Identify your strengths and your weaknesses. Play to your strengths, accept compliments and don't indulge in negative thoughts.
 Relationships with family and friends must be maintained, and many are strengthened through sharing life's high and low points. Share your emotions with the people you trust and encourage them to confide in you.
 Self-reflection can help you identify times when you are prone to mood shifts. This can help you to recognize the warning signs of stress, anxiety and depression and possibly prevent them.
 Although exercise, support systems and sleep can help you manage stress, you should also find a way to limit the effects on your body and mind. Massage, meditation, yoga, baths, writing and walking can help you to manage stress before it develops into anxiety.

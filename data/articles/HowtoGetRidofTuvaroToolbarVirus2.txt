 There are several highly-rated (and free) programs that you'll want to download. All of these are similar but attack the malware from different angles. It is important to run all of the programs to ensure that Tuvaro is completely eliminated.



AdwCleaner - general-changelog-team.fr/en/tools/15-adwcleaner


Malwarebytes Antimalware - malwarebytes.org

HitmanPro - surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro


, AdwCleaner is a straightforward scanning program. Simply install it, run it, and click the "Scan" button. The scanning process may take a few minutes.


Once the scan is complete, click the "Clean" button to remove all of the objects that AdwCleaner found.
 When you run the program for the first time, you will be prompted to update. Make sure to update before scanning. Once the program has been updated, click "Scan Now". The scan may take a little while to complete.


After the scan has completed, click "Quarantine All" and then ""Apply Actions".
You will likely be prompted to reboot.
 You may be prompted by Windows to allow the program to run. Once the program is running, a Command Prompt window will appear. Press any key on your keyboard to start scanning.


A Notepad window will open after the scan which lists all of the objects removed during the scan.
 If you don't want HitmanPro to scan your system every time it starts, uncheck the option during installation. You can also choose to forgo installation completely, and run HitmanPro as a one-time scanner.


After the scan has completed, click Next and then select "Activate free license". This will remove the found objects.
 Strange things can happen when a computer reboots, so it's always a good idea to reboot once and then run each scan again. The scanners may detect things they couldn't before.After you've' finished running scans and everything is coming up clean, move on to the next section.

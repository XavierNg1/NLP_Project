Make sure that it's a shirt that you don't mind ruining.
 Type "Error 404 Costume Not Found" into an image search to find graphics that other people have created. Print it out and attach it to the front of your shirt with tape. If you want to make sure that it's secure, you can put thick clear packing tape over the entirety of the sign. This will also make it water resistant.

 Unless you know your subject well, a bit of research is needed before writing your article.


Research using the Internet. Use reliable neutral or unbiased sources. Information of Wikipedia is a good starting point. So is reading articles from peer reviewed sources. You can also check mainstream newspaper articles too.
Search wikiHow importable videos or head to one of the video sources listed at wikiHow. Listen and take notes from the video. Use that information to write your article.;
, Check to see if the video was made by a well known company. Just because you saw Joe's video on YouTube doesn't mean that it's accurate. Check to see how others rated the video.
 Doing a bit of research will help. If you know your subject well, then you will know what image, graphic or photo to use.


Accurate images, graphics or photos are important as they are often what catches the readers eye. Make sure to use the right image, graphic or photo to help lead them to reading your article.

Savvy readers will also know when an inaccurate image, graphic or photo is used and wonder if the article is truly accurate.
 Both will add to your credibility. A well written article is almost always credible.
 Do not plagiarize. You can use research information but you should write down what you found in your own writing. To "borrow" someone's writing could be construed as a copyright violation. It also lessens your article's credibility.

 Keeper leagues allow fantasy owners to hang on to a predetermined number of players. Deciding on keepers is mostly about being able to forecast which players will be more valuable than the players you would draft in their place. If you believe Player A will outperform his draft slot, then you should keep him. If you think there’s a chance you can get a better player in his spot, toss him back.
 Not only will it help you avoid selecting a player in the draft that belongs to another team, but it will give you an idea of your opponents’ strengths going into the draft. This can help in the early rounds of the draft: if you notice that a player drafting ahead of you has kept several pitchers, it’s a safer bet that he or she will not pick another pitcher early. It isn’t always indicative of opposing strategy, but you can occasionally plan your early draft strategy around other teams’ keepers.
 Remember that in the early rounds of a keeper draft, the goal should be to fill in your roster holes as quickly as possible. You already have a number of good players, so be mindful of your league’s scoring settings and make sure you bolster your roster in areas that weren’t addressed through your keepers.

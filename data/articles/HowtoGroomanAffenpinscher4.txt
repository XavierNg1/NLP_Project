 Most dogs don’t like getting their nails trimmed, so you’ll need to take extra precautions to ensure your dog stays still during the process. To do so, swaddle it in a blanket or towel so it cannot wriggle around while you are trimming its nails. To swaddle your dog, first lay it on its back on top of the blanket. Wrap each side of the blanket up and over your dog’s belly, tucking it securely underneath your dog on the opposite side of its body. Leave only one leg exposed at a time., Using a small nail grinder or nail trimmer, take small snips out of your dog’s nail until you have cut them back to just before the quick, or the small white or pink vein that runs between your dog’s toes. Repeat this on each nail until you’ve trimmed them all.


Accidentally cutting the quick can cause quite a bit of bleeding. If you do cut it, apply styptic powder to stop the bleeding., When you are finished trimming its nails, cut the hair around your dog’s feet. Using small scissors, cut the hair on the bottom of its feet so that it is even with the pad. Then, trim the hair around the outside of its foot so that your dog’s foot looks round.

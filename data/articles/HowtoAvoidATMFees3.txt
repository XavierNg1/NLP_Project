 At the beginning of each week, consider your plans. Are you going anywhere or doing anything that requires cash? Try to make a trip to an ATM associated with your bank and withdraw as much as you need. If you go into each week with as much cash as you need, you're less likely to end up in a bind where you need to use an ATM fast.


Be careful to budget. Make sure any money you're taking out of an ATM won't affect your ability to pay any bills or living expenses.You may want to avoid carrying a lot of cash on you, however. If someone steals your wallet, you'll simply lose the money you were carrying. Withdraw around $100 at the beginning of your week. Then, only take the amount you think you'll need when going out., It's usually quicker and more convenient to pay on your card, even if you're only spending a few dollars. If you're good at budgeting and check your account balance regularly, use your card unless it's absolutely necessary to pay with cash. This way, you're more likely to have cash when you actually need it. This lessens your reliance on ATMs.


For example, if you're bar hopping use your card at bars with no tab minimum. Save your cash supply for cash only bars or bars that have a high tab minimum for cards.
 When you're thinking of going to an ATM, pause and ask yourself if this purchase is really necessary. If you have to use an ATM that charges a fee, it may not be. Add $3 on to whatever you're thinking of buying and decide whether it's still worth it. For example, a $2 taco at a food truck may seem like a bargain, but if you have to use an ATM that charges a fee you're really paying $5. Maybe you should save your money and eat at home.

 Mix two egg whites and three cups of powder sugar together in a medium bowl. Keep stirring until the mixture takes on a glue-like consistency. Make sure that you’ve stirred away all of the major lumps. Set your mortar aside.
 Place a single row of sugar cubes on top of the circle you’ve drawn for your foundation. Try to make it so that the cubes are angled in the same direction slightly inward. Once you are happy with the placement of the cubes, secure each of them to the platform with mortar.Be aware that you can also use a hot glue gun to connect the cubes to the platform and to one another. However, you’ll want to be very careful or you could accidently melt the cubes in the process.
If you are building on top of a Styrofoam ball, it is possible to reverse this process and build from the top down.
 Add another layer of sugar cubes on top of the first one and continue on. You will also want to gradually decrease the circumference of the layer circles. For a smaller igloo, five or so layers may be sufficient. Keep going until the igloo is closed at the top., Since you used a liquid mixture to attach the cubes, you’ll want to leave your igloo alone for a number of hours in order to let it fully dry out. Then, if you move it, be careful not to jolt it too much or pieces might break away.

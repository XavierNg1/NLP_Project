 Each flower will have stamen to produce pollen, a stigma to collect pollen, and a pistil leading to the ovule. Identify these structures in the flower. This will allow you to collect and move pollen to and from the correct structures.The stamina (or stamens) look like little antennae that carry pollen.
The pistil is usually in the center of the flower, and the stigma is on top of the pistil.
The ovule can be found at the base of the pistil.
 Use a brush or cotton swab to touch the stamen of your flower. Be careful not to push too hard with your brush. Coat the brush as well as you can with pollen to ensure an effective pollination.
 Pollen reaches the ovule by travelling down the pistil. The stop of the pistil, or stigma, is designed to collect pollen and move it down to the ovule. Use your brush to transfer pollen onto the stigma.

 Pull your hair to the back of your head, then gather it in one hand just like you would for a normal ponytail. All of your hair should be in a single thick rope.


It doesn't matter exactly where you wear your ponytail; you can wear it low, high or in the middle. It does help, however, if you have at least shoulder-length hair so that you have enough length to work with.;
, Either use your free hand for this, or hold the ponytail down with elastics and use both hands. Grab your ponytail and wrap it around itself once to form a circle with an indent in the middle. Use an elastic to hold this in place.


Standing in front of a mirror and having a friend hold a second mirror behind you can help you see what you're doing.
 Wrap the ponytail tight around itself once more. Tuck the end of the ponytail underneath the new bun. Hold it in place with another elastic band.
 At this point, your bun is basically done. You can gently push it to change its position or to tuck stray hairs back in. When it's just how you like it, you're done.


Be careful-fiddling with your bun too much can make it come apart.

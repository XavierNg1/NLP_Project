 Separate egg whites from 3 eggs. Follow the rules mentioned strictly to achieve best results. When you separate the eggs and pour into the bowl, the bowl must be clean from grease/water. Egg whites will be easy to separate when they are cold.

See to that you do not see even a speck of yolk in the separated whites. Do not use your finger into the whites to take any speck of yolk/shell.
Use a grease-free spoon. Wait until the egg whites reach the room temperature. Once they reach room temperature, pour them in a wide and tall, grease-free dry vessel.
Use a grease-free whisk and beat them with hand until they become frothy.
,, ., Add sugar only 1 tbsp. at a time. Beat them in medium speed.

Cut a small hole in one corner and start to pipe the macaroons. You can check the video on piping the macaroons below.

If you do not have zip lock or piping bag, you can just use two spoons to form clumps, if you do not worry on the structure of the macaroon.
,, You can keep them for weeks/months in room temperature.

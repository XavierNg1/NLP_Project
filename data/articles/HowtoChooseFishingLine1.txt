 Before you choose a line, be clear about what kind of fishing you are taking on. Fishing lines have a pound-test strength, which can go from one pound all the way up to 75. Choosing which lbs test line you are going to use depends on what fish you are looking for. But as a rule of thumb, the smaller the line the narrower it’s diameter, so the less likely it is to put off the fish.The lbs test refers to amount of force the line should be able to withstand at its weakest point.
It does not meant that you cannot catch a fish bigger than 12lbs on a 12lbs test line.
You can use the drag on your reel to help you to do this.;
, As well as getting the right strength line, you should also choose a line that best matches the water you will be fishing in. Because freshwater is less dense than saltwater, freshwater lines will be generally have larger diameters and lower line densities than saltwater lines, in order to improve flotation., Saltwater fishing line will generally be designed for quick accurate casts that can travel long distances. If you take a freshwater line saltwater fishing, it won’t help you to get the results you are hoping for. With the denser saltwater you can use a line with a smaller diameter without compromising on floatation., There are a number of different types of line which are constructed in different ways with different strengths and weakness. Monofilament line is the most popular line for most uses, as it is thin and strong. You can get monofilament line that is of a very narrow diameter which will be less intrusive in the water, but doesn’t lose its pound-test strength.Monofilament line is relatively inexpensive, and this contributes to its popularity.It will break down over time when exposed to direct sunlight, so look to replace it every six months or a year.

 This works best if you spray the key, or place a straw against the lock and spray through the straw. You may use any of the following:Commercial deicer
Rubbing alcohol
PTFE powder lubricant (best for prevention)
Warning: avoid WD40, grease lubricant, and silicone lubricant, which can gum up the lock. Graphite is safe in small quantities.
Do not combine multiple lubricants., Place a cardboard toilet paper roll or another cylindrical object over the lock to direct the air. Heat the lock by blowing into the roll with your breath or a blow dryer.This may take some time.
 Only try this if the key is 100% metal and does not contain an electronic chip. Hold the key with thick gloves or tongs, and heat it above a match or lighter. Insert the key into the lock and wait for the ice to thaw.

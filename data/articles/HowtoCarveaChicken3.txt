 Start at the back of the bird and work towards the front (the end with the wings still attached.), Angle the knife and cut down along the wishbone toward the wing. Make a cut between the breast and the wing.


Another option is to bend the breast halves back to pop out the keel bone and then remove the keel bone. Using poultry shears or a knife, cut the breast into halves through the wishbone. Cut each breast half into halves.
 Pull it away from the body while simultaneously cutting the meat away from the bone. Cut through the skin holding the breast to the body.If you want to cut the breast up further, lay the breast on the cutting board. Place your knife at a 45 degree angle from the board and slice through the meat.

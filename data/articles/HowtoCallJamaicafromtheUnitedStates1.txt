 Since Jamaica belongs to the North American Numbering Plan (NARP), no international codes are need. Simply dial the Jamaican phone number as you would with any U.S. number outside your area code. Depending on your carrier, dial “1” first if needed. Then enter 876, which is Jamaica’s area code. After that, enter the seven-digit phone of the person or company that you’re trying to call., If you are calling from a landline in an office, dorm room, or another internal phone network, dial out before entering the Jamaica phone number. Avoid calling another extension on your network by mistake. Dial "9," "#," or whichever digit or symbol opens your phone line to an outside call.
 If you are calling from a different time zone than Jamaica’s and are supposed to place your call at specific time there, be sure to check the difference in hours before placing the call. Be aware that, unlike the U.S., Jamaica does not observe Daylight Savings Time. This means that Jamaica is always five hours behind Greenwich Mean Time.In U.S. terms, this means they use Eastern Standard Time all year long, without ever “springing ahead” to Eastern Daylight Time for the summer.

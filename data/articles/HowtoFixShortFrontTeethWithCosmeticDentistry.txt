 Veneers are thin coverings bonded to your teeth, creating a new enamel-like layer. They can improve tooth sensitivity, appearance, and strength. Porcelain veneers are the quickest and easiest way to improve your tooth color, hide stains and cracks, and perfect your smile.;
, Crowns add mass/structure to a tooth, as opposed to merely creating a new tooth surface (as veneers do). Depending on the size of your teeth, porcelain crowns could be perfect for creating more length.
 Porcelain veneers and porcelain crowns are the thinnest and most natural-looking options. They can be created in any shape and color, and your dentist will carefully shade your veneers to make them indistinguishable from your other teeth. Porcelain also mimics the light-reflecting properties of a natural tooth.
 If your dentist is applying porcelain veneers, the thinness of the veneers means that very little tooth alteration will be necessary and the process should only take two appointments. Porcelain crowns are slightly more involved, but should only take two appointments as well. You may need to wear a temporary crown in between the tooth preparation and receiving your permanent porcelain crowns.
 Porcelain veneers and porcelain crowns can be treated just like your natural teeth, and no one will notice the difference between your dental structures and other teeth. Porcelain crowns and porcelain veneers are just as functionally beneficial as they are cosmetically beneficial: enjoy your improved bite and chewing capabilities.

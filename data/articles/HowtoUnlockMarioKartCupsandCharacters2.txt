Mario Kart 8 was released in 2014 for the Wii U. If you're playing Mario Kart on the original Wii console, see the section on Mario Kart Wii.



If you finish in 1st place after a full cup (not just a single track), you unlock a new character, randomly chosen from the list of free characters you haven't unlocked yet. Winning the same cup more than once won't unlock a new character, but a different engine class counts as a different cup. For instance, winning 50cc Mushroom Cup and 100cc Mushroom Cup unlocks two characters. Here are the characters that can be unlocked this way:
Metal Mario
Toadette
Lakitu
Rosalina
Baby Rosalina
Pink Gold Peach
Iggy Koopa
Roy Koopa
Ludwig von Koopa
Lemmy Koopa
Larry Koopa
Morton Koopa Jr
Wendy O. Koopa

Mii is a special character whose weight class is determined by your Mii avatar's current height and weight. There are many internet rumors about how to unlock Mii, but the character is most likely unlocked using the same random unlock as the other characters: winning cups.



Unlock the next Grand Prix Cup by getting 1st place in the previous cup (set of four tracks). Once a cup is unlocked, you can play it in any engine class.There are two different progressions of cups, plus a special mode to unlock:
Mushroom Cup → Flower Cup → Star Cup → Special Cup
Shell Cup → Banana Cup → Leaf Cup → Lightning Cup
Beat all eight cups in the 150cc engine class to unlock Mirror Mode for all cups, with every course left-to-right reversed.,

 Before bathing your Papillon, remove tangles with a slicker brush and brush its hair with a comb. Then, apply a pre-shampoo to its coat before placing it in the sink or bathtub. The pre-shampoo will protect the Papillon’s coat from being over-cleansed.Buy a pre-shampoo from your local pet supply store.
Fill the bath with three to four inches of warm water. Make sure the water is warm and does not go past your dog’s knees.
Bath your dog once every three weeks, or as needed., Once in the tub, slowly wet your dog’s hair with a pitcher full of warm water. Squeeze a teaspoon of shampoo into the palm of your hand. Lather your dog’s coat with the shampoo by gently massaging the shampoo down to its skin. Rinse out the shampoo with a pitcher full of fresh, warm water. Squeeze your dog's coat to see if any shampoo bubbles come up. If they do, keep rinsing until all shampoo is removed.Afterwards, apply a 1/2 teaspoon of conditioner. A quality dog conditioner will help keep your Papillon’s coat tangle-free, shiny, and strong. Make sure to rinse the conditioner out completely. If left in, it will cause your dog’s coat to be greasy and heavy., To dry your Papillon, pat their coat down with a towel. Do not rub. Finish drying your Papillon by blow-drying its hair. Make sure the blow dryer is not too hot.Lift your dog’s hair and dry the roots first. Drying from the roots first prevents your Papillon’s coat from becoming wavy. Blow-dry down and in the direction of the hair growth; never against it.
You can apply a leave-in conditioner before drying its hair. Lightly spray the coat with the conditioner, comb, and then begin to dry.

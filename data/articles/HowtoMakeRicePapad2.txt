 Boil 7 cups of water then add 1 teaspoon Ajwain, 1 teaspoon cumin seed, 4 teaspoons salt, 4-5 teaspoons green chili, 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, and 3 teaspoons papad kharo or baking soda.Stir everything together and turn down the heat.
 Add 4 cups of rice flour to the mixture of water and spices. Turn the heat back up and bring it back to a boil. Mix the flour with a wooden spoon then turn the heat off. Continue to mix the rice flour until it is a dough consistency., Take a chunk of dough and press it into a flat ball. Press two indents in it with your finger. Do this with all of the dough., Set around three chunks of dough on the plate at a time. Put the plate over a pot of water. Put a lid on top of the plate and bring the water to a boil. Cook for about 10-15 minutes., When the dough is finished cooking, put the dough chunks in a bowl. Cut the cooked dough into smaller pieces then mash it with the bottom of a glass.


Mash the dough quickly before it gets cold.
Make sure there are no lumps in the dough and that it is smooth., Roll the dough balls into spheres then flatten them. The easiest way to flatten them is with a peri press. If you donâ€™t have a peri press, you can use a rolling pin or a flat and heavy object.


Cover the dough with a piece of saran wrap before you flatten it to avoid the dough getting stuck.

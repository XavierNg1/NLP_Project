 This will help you choose a size. A wider, longer cigar will take longer to smoke. If you only have twenty minutes to smoke, choose a thinner, shorter cigar. If you have a few hours to nurse your cigar, choose one with a larger diameter.


Size has nothing to do with flavor, so do not worry about sacrificing flavor if you decide on a smaller cigar. The taste is determined by the tobacco that constitutes the inside and outside wrapping of a cigar. ;
, Cigars come in many different shapes. Ask the tobacconist to show you a few different shapes and hold them in your hand to see which you prefer.


The two main groups of cigar shapes are parejos and figurados. Parejos are straight-sided cigars, while figurados include any cigar with an irregular shape. Try out both types to help you narrow down your search.
 A cigar's gauge, or diameter, is measured in 64ths of an inch. A larger gauge will take longer to smoke. It will also mean less of the flavor is coming from the wrapper, and more from the tobacco inside of the cigar.
 The outside of a cigar can reveal a lot about your smoke. In cigars, you really can judge a book by its cover. Make sure there are no tears, flakes or gaps in the wrapping that might make it difficult to smoke. Check the moisture. Make sure the cigar does not look dry. It will not burn properly if it has not been well humidified. Gently squeeze along the cigar. Make sure that it is firmly packed. If there are weak spots at any point in the cigar, it will fall apart as you smoke it.

 Since wood often has a shiny finish, it's best to try the prying method before resorting to chemicals. Use a sharp knife to gently loosen the edge of the paint splatter and attempt to pry it up.









Don't angle the knife downward, or you'll scratch the wood.
If the paint doesn't pop up easily, try another method.
 This is the next best thing to prying it up. Make a solution of dish soap and warm water, and pour it over the area. Try to gently scrub it away, taking care not to scratch the wood.
 Soak one corner of a folded paper towel with rubbing alcohol. Gently rub the surface of the paint splatter, taking care not to rub the wood itself. The paint should begin to loosen and transfer to the paper towel. Continue dabbing it with the paper towel until the paint is gone.









This method may damage the finish of the wood, so be very careful where the alcohol splatters.
 Use a cleaner for wood flooring to clean the area that was stained. Let the floor completely dry. The area should now be paint-free.

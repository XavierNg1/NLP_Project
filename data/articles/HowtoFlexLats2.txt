 Start in the same basic position as the relaxed front pose you engaged in earlier. Make fists with your hands. Then, place your fists on the widest part of your hips. Flare your lats while leaning back slightly.You can also flex your pecs and arms while engaging in this pose.
 Turn around and bend one of your legs slightly to flex your calf. Turn your leg to the side slightly. Hold your arms above your head, bending them at the elbow in a traditional flexing pose. Flex your lats as you lean backwards.Be aware of your shoulders during this pose. It's important not to squish your shoulder blades together.
 Keep your feet in the same position they were in for the double bicep pose. Locate the thickest part of your obliques. Place your fists against this part of your oblique muscles. Then, lean back slightly while you spread your lats outward.Make sure you're spreading your lats only and not your back. Try to keep your back from flexing or stretching while you engage in this pose.

 Take some time to ask each family member attending what type of movie they like. Ask them if they have any suggestions for movies in that genre. When you've received everyone's responses, tally them together to see if there are similar or duplicate requests, then make a decision on the movie. You might hold a vote, choose a movie but ask if it's okay or simply make an informed decision based on your information gathering.


When picking a movie, make sure that the younger members of your family will understand it and not get confused. All movies chosen should be age appropriate for the children watching it.;
, There will need to be enough room for your entire family to sit comfortably. If necessary, you can bring in some beanbag chairs, lie down a comfortable blanket or just sit on the floor. A living room is the best place for this, but you can enjoy the movie in a bedroom, games room or other room that has a TV, as well.
 Part of the fun of movie night is staying warm and cozy. If it's a warm night though, just provide cushions and pillows for leaning on.
 If you are having the movie after dinner, have dessert during the movie. If it's later, have some snacks, such as popcorn, candies, fresh fruit slices, or home baked cookies. Try to keep it healthy and in small portions; it's only a snack after all.
 Let family members know that the movie starts at "X time" and that it will start without them if they're too late. Forewarning of a time gives everyone a chance to stop their other activities for the night.
 Snuggle around the TV together, put the movie on and hush, it's time to start watching now.

 Locate the Copy app on your iPad. It’s the app with a white background with an origami crane. Tap on it to launch it.
 If you’re already logged in, you may skip this step. Otherwise, input your Copy email address and password, and then tap the “Log in” button.
 Navigate through your Copy folders by tapping on them until you’re in the folder where the items you want to move are located. Navigation is done on the left panel.
 After selecting the files and folders to delete, tap the Delete link found on the bottom toolbar of the left panel. A confirmation box will appear. Tap the Delete button from here as well.


All the selected files and folders will be immediately deleted from your Copy folder. Whatever you’ve just deleted from your iPad will also be removed from your Copy account online, and across all other instances of your Copy account.

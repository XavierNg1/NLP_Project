 You will be using one of these to hold the ponytail, the other to hold the braid, and the third to hold the top knot. Choose hair ties that match your hair color, if possible.


If you have thinner hair, use only two hair ties. You'll be using a thinner hair tie to bind your braid instead.;
, Hold your ponytail with the hand that has all of the hair ties on it. Use your other hand to pull one of the elastics off and to wrap it around your ponytail. Depending on the thickness of your hair, you'll need to wrap it once or twice.
 Divide your ponytail into three even sections. Braid your ponytail until you have a few inches of hair left.
 Use the second hair tie on your wrist to do this. If you have thinner hair, you may need to use a smaller hair tie instead.
 If you have thick hair, you can skip this step. If you have straight or thin hair, there is a little trick you can do to give your braid more volume. Grab a small section from the tail-end of your braid, and wrap it around your finger. Hold it tight, then use your other hand to slide the rest of the braid down slightly, scrunching it.
 Twist the braid until it starts to coil around itself, then wrap it around the base of the ponytail.
 Hold the braid with the hand that has the final hair tie on it. Use your other hand to pull the hair tie off your hand and onto the top knot. Wrap the hair tie once or twice around the base of the top knot to secure it.
 Tuck the end of your braid against the base of the top knot. Fold the top knot over the end, and secure it to your hair with some hair pins or bobby pins. Secure the rest of the top knot to your hair with more hair pins or bobby pins.








Use hair pins or bobby pins that match your hair color.

 You should wait until they get on Animal Jam to buddy them. Sending them buddy requests while they're offline can result in waiting a long time to get a response.
 Don't send them Jam-a-grams asking where they are because that is how fans act around famous Jammers.
 Famous Jammers get swarmed by fans and joining the swarm makes you seem obsessed, too. Wait until the Jammer is done being swarmed.
 Casually act like this Jammer is normal and no big deal. If they ask about how you know them, mention the video you picked. Once you two have seem to be friends a bit, buddy them. It increases the chance of getting accepted into their buddy list. But, be warned: Since they are famous, their buddy list could be full. If that happens, just ask them to add you. Keep at least 3 spaces always open in your list for them.
 The famous Jammer could catch you and think you just wanted attention. Keep quiet about the friendship.
 This could help you get famous as well. If they say no, don't be upset or throw a fit. Just say, "Ok. Maybe some other time," and go somewhere else so they can record. Throwing a fit could annoy the Jammer and make them think you just buddied them to be in their videos. If they say yes, ask what you should do and where they want you to be. This will make them think you're more focused on doing a good job in the video than obsessing over them. It helps them feel relieved and fresh.

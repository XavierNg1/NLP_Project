Beans are also a good source of protein and iron, as well as zinc and biotin.Incorporating nuts into your diet will also give you a good protein boost. Some nuts, such as Brazil nuts, contain selenium, which promotes scalp health., Fish is a good source of protein, but it is also an excellent way to get Omega-3 fatty acids into your diet.

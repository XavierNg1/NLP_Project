 This is governed by the intended use of the document. Identify how many different pieces of information must be captured, and relate that to the number of fields required to provide adequate space for that data.;
, The idea is to create a flow from 1 field to the next that simply makes sense to those who will make use of the document. A very simple form that is intended to capture basic contact information may follow a sequence of date, first name, last name, address, city, state or province, zip or postal code, telephone and fax numbers and a field for an email address.
 Software applications typically make it easy to create fields that can be situated by using a computer mouse to drag the field into position on a blank document. Create and place fields that correspond to the data that must be captured on the form in the same logical sequence identified earlier.
 Most software programs that aid in creating forms make it possible to adjust the length and width of each field, as well as restrict the type of characters that are allowed in each field. This makes it possible to ensure that dates and telephone numbers are entered in a uniform manner.
 If the form is to be used in an online environment or part of a template in a database, adding drag down menus will often require creating a table and associating it with the appropriate field. Specific instructions in how to accomplish this can be found in the support materials that came with the software.
 Before releasing the form for general use, take the time to enter some data and make sure the result is within your expectations. Should the data fail to capture properly, or 1 or more fields do not function as anticipated, return to the form template and make adjustments.

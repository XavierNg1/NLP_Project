 Kids will run faster if they are racing against other kids.
 A large poster board or a bulletin board with times and distances will allow kids to monitor how they are improving.
 For example, once a kid achieves running a mile in less than 8 minutes, give him a prize or a special treat. Children respond to rewards and incentives.
 Set up obstacle courses, or break them into teams for relays so they can cheer each other on.
 Instead of standing on the sidelines with a stopwatch, get out there and do some running yourself. Having you there to motivate them will help the kids run faster.

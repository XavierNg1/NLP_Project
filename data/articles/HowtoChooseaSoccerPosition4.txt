 The center striker, on most teams, is the top goal scorer. They must be aggressive towards goal, with a wicked shot as well as the ability to put any sort or pass or cross on goal no matter the body part. They use their strength to hold off defenders and keep the ball, either to turn and shoot or to wait for support to arrive.


Center strikers must be confident with their back to goal, even if there is a defender on them.
Moves, tricks, and quick bursts of speed are all important weapons to blow by defenders.
You must not only shoot well but quickly. You should be able to fire off a shot with only a little bit of free space., Outside striker systems often don't have outside midfielders, meaning the outside striker has space to beat one defender and attack the goal. They are good crossers and good in the air, getting lots of balls from the striker on the other side of the field and sending others over. They tend to have good endurance, too, as they defensively cover the field back to half-field or further.


Speed and quickness, as well as controlled foot skills at high speed, are highly recommended.
 A frequent striker combination is to have two center forwards up together. But forwards are never effective when they're taking up the same space -- they work best when they are staggered with one above the other. The striker near goal holds the ball up, facing half-field, to draw defenders in. This creates space for the lower striker to get the ball facing goal, taking more shots.


When staggered, the top striker is usually the bigger one. He/she wins the ball out of the air, holds it, then plays off to the lower striker.
The lower striker is usually quicker, turning and facing goal with quick passes and moves and using the high striker as support.

 A simple touch like fresh flowers can do wonders for making a guest feel happy and content. In fact, they don't even need to be fresh. A pretty silk or even paper arrangement can be just as lovely. Framed photographs, carefully arranged knickknacks, and collections of books can also add happy details., Scents can also make your place feel homey. You don't want anything that will knock your guests over. In fact, scents that are too strong can cause problems for some guests if they have allergies. However, a soft scent can make it feel warm and welcoming. Try something like vanilla or cinnamon to make it seem like home.To add scents, you can use wax warmers, candles, diffusers, or plugins.
 Light is important in setting the mood. Natural lighting creates a warm glow, so when it's still light out, make sure to let the light into your home. Draw back the curtains, or use sheer white curtains so that your home will feel open and airy.Create intimacy with electrical lighting. Overhead lights can be harsh and uninviting, particularly when you have guests over. Instead, use a variety of lamps, track lighting, and/or recessed lighting to create a comfortable atmosphere.Candles or a fire can also make your home feel cozy and inviting, particularly in the winter.
 Plants add a natural feel to your home, making it feel more comfortable. They literally give the place life, and green puts people in a good mood. Just make sure you remember to water your plants, so they look fresh and happy. Nothing is sadder than a brown, wilted plant in the corner.

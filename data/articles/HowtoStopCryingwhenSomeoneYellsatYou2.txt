 Go to your car, your office, a restroom, or somewhere else you won’t be bothered. If you need to cry, let it out. Give yourself all the time you need until you feel calm again.

If you try to stop a crying session halfway through, you’ll be more likely to start up again later.
 Dab cold water underneath your eyes to cut down on redness and puffiness. You can also use an ice cube wrapped in a napkin.If you’re at home and not in a hurry, wrap a bag of frozen peas in a kitchen towel and put it on your face, or rest cold green tea bags on your eyes.
 Use eye drops like Visine to get rid of any lingering eye redness. Put one or two drops in each eye. Your eyes should look clear in 10 to 15 minutes.If you’re a frequent crier, don’t use eye drops too often. They can actually make your eyes redder if you overuse them. A couple of times a week should be fine.
Make sure your eye drops are safe to use with contacts, if you wear them.
 If you wear makeup, take a minute to touch it up. Wipe off runny eye makeup and any other areas on your face that have gotten smeared. Use foundation or concealer to hide red or blotchy areas. Finish by touching up your mascara, blush, or anything else that didn’t make it through your cry.If you cry often, you might want to keep a small emergency makeup stash in your desk or purse.

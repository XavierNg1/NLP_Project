 Check out the websites of different publishing houses to see if they accept query letters or if they only accept solicitations from agents. Many publishing houses only accept work that has been brought to them through an agent.


Find publishers that not only accept unagented submissions, but which specialize in the type of book you are writing.
 The method for writing a query letter for a publishing house is the same as it is for contacting an agent. You'll have to introduce your book as well as yourself and to provide a brief synopsis of the work.


If the publishing house is impressed by your letter, you will be asked to send along part of or all of the manuscript.
 If the publishing house is impressed by your work, you will be given an offer. Look at your contract carefully and sign it if it meets your demands.
 Work with an editor to revise your book until it is ready for publication.
 While you're waiting for the book to be released, market the book to everyone you know â€” and people you don't know. Once your book is published, you will have to continue to advertise for your book. You can enjoy your publication, but remember that marketing should never stop.


Promote your book through blogging, interviewing, and reading from your book.
Develop a Facebook fan page and website to advertise your book.

 If your legs are swollen, you can lay on your back with your legs propped up above your head. This will help reduce the swelling. If the swelling is consistently bad, try sleeping like this., Don’t cause yourself pain, but massage the area where you notice swelling. Rub the muscles firmly to reduce fluid build-up in your muscles., If you find yourself sitting or standing in one position for a long time, take a moment to stretch. Each hour, take just 2-5 minutes to stretch. Ankle pumps, quad stretches, and calf stretches are a great way to get the blood flow without doing a lot of movement. You can do these stretches silently at your desk or while standing so that it they don’t disrupt your day.


If your hands and fingers feel swollen, focus on shoulder and back stretches.

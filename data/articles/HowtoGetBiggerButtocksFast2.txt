 Baggy jeans can swallow up even the biggest butt. Try to find pants that are comfortably snug without being too tight or you’ll risk showing unflattering lines and rolls.


Pants that are too tight will butch together in the groin area, which is unsightly and uncomfortable to wear.
Never wear pants that are tight enough to cut off circulation in your legs. This is dangerous and can cause you serious harm.
 Clothing that accentuates your waist will naturally make your butt and hips look bigger and also give you that sought-after hourglass silhouette.


Cinch your waist using a belt or wearing a peplum shirt or dress. The flair created by the belt or peplum will accentuate the size your behind.
 Regular underwear can flatten your butt and give you unsightly panty lines that show through your clothing. Thongs allow both of your butt cheeks to hang loose while underwear with butt padding provide an extra push and volume to your behind.Butt pads are also called butt enhancers or butt shapewear. Butt pads enhance your butt by compressing it and lifting it. The extra padding also adds more butt to your behind.
 You don't have to reserve your stretchy pants for exercise only. These types of pants hug your curves, making your legs and butt look toned and voluptuous.


If you don’t like the leggings or yoga pants look, try wearing jeggings or jeans that have a fair amount of spandex in them.

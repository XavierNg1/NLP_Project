 Choose two colors, a base coat and a dot color. If you'd like, you can use multiple colors for the dots.









Apply the basecoat color. Allow it to dry completely.
Dip a small brush, toothpick or pin into the polish you chose for the dots and lightly tap the implement on your nail. Continue doing this until your nail has as many dots as you want. For other effects, you can create dots of varying sizes by using thinner or thicker-tipped implements. To make fading or trailing dots, dip the implement in the paint once and apply several dots without reapplying paint. You can also use your fine-tipped implement to drag the paint out from the wet dot to create rays, swirls and other designs.
When the dots are dry, finish with a clear top coat.
 An arrangement of dots can be made to look like a flower. Choose three colors: a base coat color, a color for the center of the flowers, and a color for the petals.









Apply the basecoat. Allow it to dry completely.
Use a thin-tipped brush or toothpick to place groups of five dots arranged in circles on your nails. These are the petals.
When the petal dots dry, use the the same color to paint a simple circle in the center of the petal dots. You can add extra detail by placing a tiny white stripe in the center of the petals, or creating leaves with green nail polish. Take care not to crowd too many flowers on each nail. Make sure the flowers are distinct from one another.
When the flower designs are dry, finish with a clear topcoat.
 For this look choose two colors: a light and a dark. Try fuschia or orange and black.









Use the lighter color to make splotches on your nails. The shapes don't have to be uniform, just as leopard's spots aren't uniform.
When the splotches dry, draw "C" or "U" shapes around the outsides of the blobs using the darker color.
When the leopard spots are dry, finish with a clear top coat - or, for added flair, paint over the design with a clear glittery nail polish.

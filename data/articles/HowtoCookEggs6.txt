 Heat the pan on the stove over medium to medium-high heat.


Give the pan several minutes to become sufficiently hot. To check the temperature, sprinkle a small amount of water into the pan. If the water immediately sizzles once it comes into contact with the pan, your pan is hot enough.
 Tap the egg on your counter or the side of your pan to gently crack the shell. Break the egg open, dropping it directly into the pan.


Cook one egg at a time to prevent the whites from running together.






Drop the eggs carefully so that the yolks do not break.
 After 2 or 3 minutes, the egg whites should be completely set on the bottom and mostly set on the top.


Note that the yolk will still be runny.
 Gently slide a spatula under your egg and flip the egg over so that the yolk is now on the bottom. Let cook for another 1 or 2 minutes, or until the yolk is set.


This must be done very carefully so that the yolk does not break as you flip it. Even if the yolk does break, however, the egg will still be edible, even though it may not look visually impressive.
 Gently slide the egg out of the frying pan and onto your serving plate using a spatula.

 It's much easier to get visitors when they actually have something to see. Don't worry if you aren't allowed or you don't feel comfortable doing it. Just read the steps below.;
, I've noticed that people with 100+ buddies get AT LEAST 1,000 more visitors than people with around 50-75.
 For example, post that you're going on vacation and will upload pictures when you return. Be sure to actually follow through, and paste your return date in too so they know when to check.
 If you see someone you recognize or think you recognize, click on their profile to learn more. Then, if you do know them, send them a buddy request and they're sure to look at your profile a decent amount.
 Go to your profile, wait for it to load enough for the visitors to show, and refresh the page. Since you count as a visitor, your count will increase by one (or 2, depending on if people visit your profile in between refreshes).

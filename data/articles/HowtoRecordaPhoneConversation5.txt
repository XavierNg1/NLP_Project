 If you are using a smartphone, there are programs that let you record effortlessly whenever you have a phone conversation. Although not everyone with a cell phone is using a smartphone, this is by far the easiest option for those who can do it.


Browse the app store for your phone's operating system. Search for call recorders. Most of them are free or very cheap.
Double check what you're getting. Read over the developer's description for the app to be sure it's what you want. Most call recorders only work with certain phones or brands; some only work with the speakerphone on. Find one that suits you.
 Make sure the app is properly working by doing a test phone-call with a friend.
 If the app seems to work, but your recording quality is low, snoop around on the Internet for solutions. There are often workarounds for such things.

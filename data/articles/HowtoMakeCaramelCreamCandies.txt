 When making caramel cream candies, you will need to do several things to prepare yourself. Read the guidelines below to help you do this.


Wash your hands. While making these candies, you will be touching foods, stirring mixture, and cutting things. Wash your hands to prevent germs from getting into your food and making others sick.



 


Tie your hair back if it is long. In this recipe, you need to boil certain things, and you wouldn't want to scald your hair in the process.






Make sure that your supplies are clean and that your ingredients are not stale. Dirty supplies, such as knives and bowls will spread germs and unwanted excess food in your recipe. Stale foods could make you sick or leave a terrible taste in your mouth. To help prevent this, clean your supplies in the dishwasher and check the expiration date of your ingredients.

, The cooking spray will help you prevent the ingredients you pour on from sticking to the pan. This will also save you from having to shake the pan and causing an unwanted mess in the process.
 If desired, add any alternative ingredients, such as sprinkles, chocolate pieces, or cut-up strawberries into the mixture as well. Stir with a whisk or spoon over medium hear until the sugar begins to dissolve and the butter strips melt.
 Cover the saucepan with a top and wait three minutes. Be sure to check often, and be sure not to boil past the time limit.
 Be sure to do this with an oven mitt on. Continue to boil at 250 degrees but do not stir. Stirring will make the mixture too moist and frothy, therefore leaving your candies squishy and fragile.
 Smooth carefully with the back of a spoon and let it cool for 5-8 minutes.
 Once firm, cut your treats into bite-sized pieces and wrap individually in wax paper or cling wrap. Candies can be stored in Tupperware containers at a room temperature.

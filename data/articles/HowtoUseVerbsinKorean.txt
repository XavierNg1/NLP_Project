 This is the basic form of the verb to be able to use it in a sentence we need to conjugate it.;
, So now you are left with the stem, 가. Now we conjugate by adding the appropriate endings depending on the person you're talking to or about, and the tense (Past, Present and Future).
 All three are needed so we'll get learning them right off the bat.
 The first and most basic ending we need is 요 (yo). In Korean verbs don't change for the person (I, You, He, She, It, We, You (plural) and They). So when we add on 요 onto the end of 가, we get 가요, which means I go, you go, she goes, etc.
 Now we need another ending, ᄊ어요. So, if we add that onto our stem, 가 we get 갔어요. This means, I went, You Went, She went, etc.
 Again, our stem is 가 so we need a new ending, ᆯ거예요. So if we add that ending onto our stem we get 갈 거예요. Which means, I will go, You will go, etc.

 You're going to be right down by the wheels, so make sure that they can't roll!

, Lugnuts are the small, hexagonal screws holding the tire onto the car. This may take some effort if the lug nuts are tight. Once loose, you can unscrew them by hand. If you're really struggling, you can apply pressure to the wrench with your foot to really get them off.









A lug wrench looks like a crowbar with a circular hole in it. It should be in your trunk with the car, but make sure you have one if not. They are also needed to change a tire.
 Lugnuts hold both the wheel and the hubcap on, and you don't want the whole wheel coming off. Take care to put the lug nuts somewhere safe so you do not lose them.









If you have five total lugnuts, take off two that are next to each other and one on the opposite side.
 These are what keep the hubcaps on, not just the lug nuts. Set them aside somewhere safe -- you'll need them.
 You don't need to completely tighten them on, just to hand tightness. Then use the lug wrench to tighten them just a quarter turn more or so. These three will keep the tire in place as you remove the other two washers.
 Without the washers, the hubcap should slide right off.
 There will be a small cut out that needs to fit over the valve of the tire. Line this up, then slide the new hubcap on and tighten on the two nuts. Just tighten them by hand for now -- don't worry about full tightness.
 Tighten them back on by hand so that your tire is back where it started. You can also slip the washers over the section








, Tighten them all by hand at first. Then, working in a circle, tighten them each one quarter-turn at a time until they don't want to move too much. Never tighten one screw completely before moving on to the others -- this can bend or warp the hubcap.

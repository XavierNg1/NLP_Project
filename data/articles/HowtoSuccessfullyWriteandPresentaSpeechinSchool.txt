 Don't choose something someone in your class is already doing, or something that was presented last year. People will compare you. Also make it something your audience can relate to.;
, Know it off by heart. Don't choose complex facts, simplify them so they're easier to remember. Difficult things to memorize will make you mess up.
 Practice in front of your cat, dog, Mom, Dad, or even your neighbor! Have them comment so you know what to work on.
 This way you can't be accused of just reading your speech. Try to look at different angles of the class, but be sure to look at students! If someone in your class is sleeping, that may help to look at them too.
 If you're nervous, people will sense that and tease you about it.

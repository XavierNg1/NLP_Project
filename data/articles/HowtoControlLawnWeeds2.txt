 You can manually remove weeds that appear in your lawn by using a thin tool such as a hori hori (thin weeding knife) or a metal weeder, puller or grubber.


All of these tools require you to kneel or bend so consider getting a knee pad if this is a problem. You could also invest in a long-handled tool.
 If you catch weeds when they are still young, you can hoe them up. Try to do this on a dry day so that you can expose the weed roots when you hoe them up. That way, they will dry and die before they can re-root.
 Some homeowners consider vinegar to be an organic method of killing weeds. You should be aware that vinegar kills anything it touches so itâ€™s likely to leave bare patches in your lawn if applied to weeds and grass.


Use caution when applying vinegar and make sure that it is only applied to weeds at their roots.
 To control weeds in your flowerbeds, you can remove them by hand. You can also lay down a layer of mulch that will help to keep weeds from growing in between your plants.
 Try to keep bare patches from forming on your lawn and try to reseed your lawn every fall. A healthy lawn will generally be less susceptible to weeds. Avoid mowing your lawn too closely, as this can weaken the grass.


Apply a slow-release fertilizer to your lawn once a year.
Aerate your lawn every few years.
 If you have acidic soil, consider applying garden lime to the lawn area over winter to discourage the growth of acid-loving weeds.

 Begin by adding a few scoops of potting soil to your compost bin - enough to create a layer a few inches (a few cm) deep. Potting soil is helpful for composting indoors because it helps regulate the moisture level of the mixture, which can prevent insect infestation or unpleasant odors.


Do not use soil collected from outdoors instead of potting soil. If you intend to use the finished compost for houseplants, the consistency and drainage ability of the soil will be compromised if you introduce outdoor soil.
 Whenever you can, collect organic scraps for composting. This can include vegetable peels or cores, coffee grounds, dead flowers, grass clippings, and leftover cooked foods like rice. Cut these scraps into small pieces to increase the available surface area for decomposition, and then place them in the bin.
 Each time you add kitchen scraps to the compost pail, you'll need to add a handful of shredded newspaper or cardboard as well. The nitrogen-rich kitchen scraps balance with the carbon-rich newspaper to create a balanced environment for bacteria.
 About once a week, use a small trowel or other tool to mix your compost around. This incorporates fresh oxygen throughout the mixture and keeps the compost from getting too compacted. You can also add a small handful of potting soil each time you do this.
 For decomposition to proceed efficiently, the compost should be moist, but not soaking wet. You can increase the moisture content of your compost by spraying some water into the bin with a spray bottle. Aim for compost that feels like a wrung-out sponge when handled.

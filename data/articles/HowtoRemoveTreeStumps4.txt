 Use a drill with a large bit to drill a series of holes in the top of the stump. The stump will absorb the chemicals through these holes, so make sure you space them evenly.
 Most stump removers are composed of powdered potassium nitrate, which reacts with the wood to soften and rot more quickly. Check the directions on the package and apply the stump remover to the stump as instructed.
 If the stump removal powder is ingested, it can cause harm to kids and pets, so make sure they don't go near it.
 It should begin to soften and rot within a few weeks. When you deem it to be soft enough to easily remove, it's time to finish the job.
 Use an ax or a shovel to chop up the softened stump. Remove pieces as you chop them away. Keep going until you've leveled the stump.
 Build a fire over the remaining softened wood and let it burn all the way down. This way you'll remove what's left of the stump and its roots.
 Dig out what's left after the fire has burned and discard it. Fill up the hole with loam or another filler, like sawdust. Keep adding more material over the next few months until the ground stays leveled.

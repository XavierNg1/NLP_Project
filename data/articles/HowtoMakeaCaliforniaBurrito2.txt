 Lay it onto the burner of a gas stove for 5-10 seconds, or lightly warm it in a skillet. For a quick fix, try warming the tortilla in the microwave for 30 seconds, or folding it into quarters and lightly browning it in a toaster.


If you lay your tortilla directly onto a gas burner, be very cautious to ensure that it doesn't catch fire. Do not leave the stove until there's nothing over the flame.
 Lay the tortilla out on a flat surface. Place a line of toppings from one edge of the tortilla about 2/3 of the way to the other edge. A smear of hot, refried beans, some warmed chopped meat, some cheese, warmed rice, avocado, salsa, grated cheese, a bit of sour cream. Don't stack your pile more than 1-2 inches wide and an inch high. If you fill your burrito too full, you might not be able to seal it.
 Fold the corners towards the center, then grab the bottom and roll it up. To seal the burrito, try poking the ends in so that they remain tucked. It may help to dip a finger in water and run it along the margin first.


Repeat as needed to make more burritos. At this point, you can serve them right away or toast them in a pan.
 This will lightly brown the sides, seal the fold, and give the tortilla a crispy texture. First, spray a large skillet with cooking spray and turn it to a medium-high heat. Lay the wraps into the skillet, seam-side down. Cook until the burrito is golden brown and crisp on the bottom. Then, turn over and cook until golden brown on the other side. The process should take 2-3 minutes per side.

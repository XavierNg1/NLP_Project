 You can find this in your list of applications or by searching for "terminal".
 This should display a large block of network information.


If you get an error message that mentions your lack of administrative privileges, enter sudo /sbin/ifconfig .
If you are using Solaris or some other Unix builds, you may need to enter /sbin/ifconfig -a to display information for more than one device.
If you get a message telling you that ifconfig is deprecated, switch to the instructions for Enter a Terminal Command in recent Linux builds above.



If there is too much information for you to find your IP address, enter /sbin/ifconfig | less to limit the amount displayed, or /sbin/ifconfig | grep 'inet addr:' to only display the IP address.
If you're not sure which device you're looking for, you most likely want "eth0", the first ethernet adapter recognized. To only view information for eth0, enter /sbin/ifconfig eth0 .

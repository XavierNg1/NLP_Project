 Don’t worry about how you will store it, just locate an area near the commode, shower or sink that could possibly be turned into a small storage area. Remember--storage doesn’t mean it has to sit on the ground either.;
, How your bathroom is decorated will most likely dictate the kind of storage you will end up using. For example, if you have a lot of crystal and white towels, you may want to consider a clear vase or jar for the T.P. However, if animal prints or a wilder style is more your taste, you could get funkier and create a small print hammock for your supplies.
 Even though replacing toilet paper is one of the easiest “chores” at home, some people simply don’t do it. Make sure that the storage system you select is something that you will easily maintain and keep up.

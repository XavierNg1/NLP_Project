 While halves and thirds have unique words in Spanish, fractions from fourths to tenths are the same as the ordinals for those numbers. The powers of ten also are ordinals.All other fractional words are formed by adding the suffix -avo to the correct cardinal number. For example, if you wanted to write out "one-eleventh" you would write "onceavo."

, When you are using the fraction as an adjective, you might add parte immediately after the fraction, just as in English you would add the word "part."For example, if you wanted to express "I took the third part," you would write "tomé la tercera parte."

, In English, fractions typically are written out as hyphenated phrases. However, in Spanish any fraction you write using words is written as one word, no matter how long that word is.For example, if you wanted to write out the fraction 1/59, you would write "cincuenta nueveavo."

, The basic rule is that fractions in Spanish are masculine if you are using them as nouns, and feminine if you are using them as adjectives.Fractional nouns that express powers of ten can be either masculine or feminine. Which you use depends on where you are in the world – in Spain they typically are feminine, while in Latin America they typically are masculine.
For example, if you wanted to write "one tenth" in Spanish you might write "décimo" in Guatemala, but in Spain you would probably want to write "décima" to ensure you were understood.
Fractional nouns other than the powers of ten are always masculine.
 Percents are expressed in Spanish the same way they are in English. You can either write it out with the words or the % sign. For example, you could write either "7 por ciento" or "7%."

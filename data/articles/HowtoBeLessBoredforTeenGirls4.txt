 If you have space for a garden at your house, see what grows well in your local climate and plant it. If you don't have space for a garden, see if you have space for planters, pots, or a window box. You can grow herbs and flowers in very little space. If you live somewhere dry, succulents can be beautiful and need very little care.


A garden is a commitment, so start small if you're not ready to be in charge of an army of zucchini. Grow one plant in a pot, and if that goes well, you can start tilling earth.
 Volunteer to help out in a place that interests you. Places like elementary schools, schools for people with special needs, hospitals, and retirement communities often need volunteers. You can also volunteer for temporary organizations, such as political campaigns or fundraising events.


Ask someone in your life if they need help. Just do it right now. Ask a parent, a grandparent, or a neighbor.
 Earning money and learning new skills can be entertaining as well as useful. Visit businesses you can get to by bike or by bus and ask if they are hiring. Look online at job boards. Ask your family members for tips: they may know someone who can help you find a job that isn't advertised.


Go into business for yourself. Sell things you craft online, sell cookies at school, or call neighbors and family friends and offer to babysit, sit for cats, look after plants, walk dogs, mow lawns, or wash cars.
 Do something unexpected that you know will be appreciated. Drop flowers or candy at your best friend's house, or wash your family's car. Offer to play a game you know a little sibling loves, even though you find it boring. You're already bored, so you might as well be bored in a sweet way.

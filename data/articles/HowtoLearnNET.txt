, Then click the 'Visual Studio' link.
 At the top, go to the left until you see the word 'Express'.
 That should take you to the selection of the different IDEs.
 Try either the Visual C# or the Visual Basic. You are free to use the C++ too, but one of the other two are the best for learning. If you are completely new to the developer world, Visual Basic,might be good for learning the key foundation to Windows Programming.
 That will bring you to the download page for that type of Visual Studio.
 Click the middle one, the 'Download' tab. then go to the the right of the screen and click 'Install Now'. You don't have to worry about paying any money. Visual Studio Express is a free version of the IDE.
, At the very bottom, there should be a 'Frequent Destinations' section. Under it, click on the link that says MSDN. (MSDN stands for Microsoft Developer Network)

, That should give you a set of How-to-videos, training courses, the Ramp UP program training, and the Beginner Developer Learning Center.
 Now you can learn how to develop applications for any of the .NET environments! Hope you have fun learning .NET and if you don't, then it's not the right one for you. Don't get discouraged for a developer programmer. It's really easy to do. Good luck!

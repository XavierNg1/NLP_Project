 A studded leather bracelet requires strips of tooled leather, assorted studs, an x-acto knife, a hammer, a snap-on clasp, and scissors.
 Wrap the leather strip around your wrist, and add an additional inch to the measurement. Use the scissors to cut the strip to length, and cut off the corners to round off the ends.
 Take your studs and arrange them how you like over the leather bracelet. When you've gotten them just where you want them to be, gently poke the leather with the prongs from the stud. Doing this will not pierce the leather, but leave a small indent.
 Use the x-acto knife to cut small slits where the prongs indented the leather. These cuts need only be wide enough for the prongs to be inserted through; cutting them too wide will show up on the finished project.
 Slide each of the studs through the slits you have cut. The prongs will stick out the back end. Twist them around just how you like them before securing them in place.
 Flip the leather strip over and use your hammer to bend down the prongs. If there are two prongs on the back of each stud, hammer them down in opposite directions.
 To create the clasp, add the snap-on buttons to either end of the bracelet. These may have prongs that can be slid through the leather and hammered down like the studs, or they may need to be glued in place.
 Use the snaps to secure the bracelet on your wrist. Adjust any studs that may have gotten twisted around or moved out of place. Your bracelet is finished! Show off your new style by making several and stacking them.

 If you believe in your heart that you can make a change, you will. But being an activist is not all about vision; action is required too. Without action, vision becomes merely a pipe-dream. Start off by listening to that inner voice telling you to explore your World and find ways to improve upon it. Once you have discovered in your heart what you would like to change / improve in your Community, you can then start the process of putting action into your goal.


For example: You see that there is a large 2 acre parcel of land that your Town owns. The Town Mayor is asking the Community members for suggestions of how to utilize the vacant land lot.
The Mayor has given you a great opportunity to open up and introduce yourself to your Community.
Once you are convinced that you have a healthy idea for the use of the Town owned lot, you must begin the process of thinking out a plan of action.
You now have to set the stage for action. You must act on the request of the Mayor and attend the Town meeting at the Town Hall. There you will have the opportunity to be heard by the Town's government officials, and other Community members, along with members of the press / media.;
, You never know, the newspaper writer might be interested in covering your idea.


Example: You suggest that the Town allow it's resident's to create a Community Garden.
The next thing you know, you may end up on the cover of your local newspaper, and maybe the Associated Press will pick up your story too. That is how you "break the ice" and announce to the World "I am here, and I am here to make a difference in my community by doing my part!" Also, you will be showing others in your community how to be a voice as well. One person can influence many others to follow their lead and accomplish creating a better community together.

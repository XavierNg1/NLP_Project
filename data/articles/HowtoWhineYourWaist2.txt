 Whining usually adds a variety of motion to the circling move. After you've mastered the basics of moving up and down while whining, move to the side. Shift your torso slightly to the left, lowering your knee as you shift your weight to the left side. Then, return to the starting position and repeat on the other side.This move is a variation on whining. You can add it to a routine, but you can also simply whine with minimal movement.
 As you get comfortable moving your waist in a circle, try to follow a whining pattern. Move your hips forward, to the side, backward, and then to the other side. Do this while counting, "One... two... three... four" in your head. This will help you maintain rhythm while you whine., Whining is all in your waist, hips, and legs. As you whine, be aware of your upper body. Keep everything above your waist still to whine correctly.

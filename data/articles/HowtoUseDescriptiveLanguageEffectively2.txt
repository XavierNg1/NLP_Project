 Who are you writing to? Your audience and topic are the two factors which will dictate what is "good" or "bad" when writing.If you are writing to yourself, think of why you are writing.
 If it is something that exists, you'll need to look at pictures or video to make sure you describe it correctly. If you are describing something in your mind, take an extra moment to really picture it.
, Accurate language is used to make writing more accurate and concise, but common writing is easier to read. Your audience determines the balance you should use. Does your audience prefer "cried" or "mourned." Will they get a better picture from "released" or "radiated." And will they appreciate the use of "ursa minor" over "constellation" or do they not care?

, It's the writer's mantra. In all ways do your very best to show what is happening rather than tell what is happening. "the sword fell from his hand and he gave up" might be more interesting as "the sword slipped from his sweaty hands as he fell to his knees." Creative writing is all about holding people's attention, so give them interesting details to pay attention to.
 Leave the writing alone for an hour, a day, a week, then a month if you can. But leave it at least for a day.
 How does it sound? Try to listen for anything jarring or awkward. Add, remove, or change as necessary. Creative writing should sound natural when read aloud.
 Story telling is an ancient pastime and we are almost programmed to enjoy stories. If you are inspired, mindful, and ...descriptive... people will listen.

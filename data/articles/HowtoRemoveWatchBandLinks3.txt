 Turn the watch on its side, find the link you wish to remove and locate the screw holding it in place.
 Use a 1mm screwdriver to remove the required screw. You can do this by applying light pressure and turning the screwdriver in a counterclockwise motion.Continue to turn in a counterclockwise motion until the screw becomes loose.
Use a pair of tweezers or pliers to grab the screw before it falls. Make sure to keep it somewhere safe, as you will need it to reassemble the watch.
Ensure that you do this over a table or tray to make sure you don't lose screws should they fall during the process.
 Once the screw has been removed, your chosen link can easily be separated from the watch band. Repeat this process for each link that you need to remove.
 Once you have removed the necessary number of links, you can reassemble your watch band by simply reconnecting the links using the removed screw and a screwdriver.

 Shop owners sometimes like to bump up the price a little more than usual, precisely because they expect to reduce the price on asking. If you don't ask, it could leave you spending loads of money on something worth not so much. To get the price back down to something realistic, you need to haggle. This is a skill that you can practice all day, everyday, provided it's acceptable where you live or shop. It's recommended that you practice a lot because shop owners are on the receiving end of haggling a lot and are skilled at good comebacks. Bear in mind that this skill works best with underground stores that don't get much money, they'll do anything to make you buy something. Some good things to say are:


"Seriously? That's a shame, I only have on me right now."
"To be honest, I think that's quite a bit. Lower the price and I'll take it off your hands."
"I saw it cheaper in , I'll get it from there."
"What? That's way too much! I can find it cheaper elsewhere."
"The online price is , and with no postage too. I'll buy it that way instead." (And it might help to start to walk away.)

, A lot of musical instruments end up in such places when people need to sell something quickly to fund general living needs. While it's sad to think that someone else has lost something so good, you can give that instrument a new chance to play sweet music again and save a penny in so doing.

 Washing your hair regularly will help the dreads continue to get tight and smooth, a "locking" process that takes at least 3 months to complete. Use a dread bar or another shampoo that doesn't contain perfumes and conditioners, which can build up in your dreads and cause them to smell.


When you wash your hair, concentrate on your scalp. Don't over handle the dreads themselves, since you don't want them to start to fray.
Wash your hair in the morning so that your dreads have time to dry. If you go to bed with wet hair, mildew and mold can grow there.
 Use a mixture of oil and water to spray your dreads every few days to keep them from drying out and fraying. Use an essential oil like tea tree or lavender. Don't add too much oil, or your dreads could look greasy; a spritz every few days is sufficient.


Don't use vegetable oil, olive oil, or other food-based oils on your dreads. They'll get absorbed into your hair and turn rancid.
Special dread moisturizer is available online.
 Going about your daily routine will inevitably cause some of your hairs to become loose from the dreads. Use a crochet hook or a tweezers to tuck the stray hairs back into the dreads.
 To maintain the smooth shape of the dreads, you can roll them between your hands periodically. Make the ends look rounded by smashing them against the palm of your hand to encourage the hairs to roll up into the dread.


If you like having wispy ends, there's no need to blunt the ends.
Don't overdo the rolling, or the dreads will be more likely to unravel.

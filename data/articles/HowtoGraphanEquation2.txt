 Because single-variable inequalities only occur on one axis, you don’t have to use Cartesian coordinates. Instead, draw a simple number line.
 These are pretty simple, because they only have one coordinate. You will be given an inequality such as x<1 to graph. To do this, first find ‘1’ on your number line.


If you are given a “greater than” symbol, which is either > or <, then draw an open circle around the number.
If you are given a “greater than or equal to” symbol, either > or <, then fill in the circle around your point.
 Using the point you just made, follow the inequality symbol to draw a line representing the inequality. If it is ‘greater than’ the point, then the line will go to the right. If it is ‘less than’ the point, then the line will be drawn to the left. Add an arrow to the end to show that the line continues and is not a segment.
 Substitute in any number to equal ‘x’ and mark it on your number line. If this number lies on the line you have drawn, your graph is accurate.

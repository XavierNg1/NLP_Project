 Handling for crab is a lot easier than the other methods in this article and there are fewer things you need. Basically, all you need is a dip net, a line or string long enough to reach the bottom of the water, and bait.You can handline from a boat or off a dock, so you'll need to consider that when you get your line.
Sometimes you have to weight the end of your line so that it sinks to the bottom.
For bait, chicken necks, eel, or fish work well. Just attach a piece to your line before you sink it.
 You'll want to tie the line down and wait a bit so that the crabs have a chance to find the bait and get attached. You'll feel when the crab has crabbed onto the bait., You don't want to spook the crab so that it lets go. The bigger the crab the more likely it will be to spook and drop off, so go carefully. When it gets near the surface, scoop it up in your net.


Pay attention to whether there is a current or tide, make sure that you place the net so that if the crab lets go it'll end up in your net and not swept away.
 Make sure that you have ice in there so that the crab gets sluggish and easier to manage. Avoid picking them up with your bare hands. Kitchen tongs or specialized crab tongs work find here.

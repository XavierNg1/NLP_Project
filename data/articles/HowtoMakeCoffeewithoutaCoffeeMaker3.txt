 Give the mixture a slight stir to help combine them.









Use about 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of coffee grounds per 1 cup (250 mL) of water you add.
 Place the saucepan on the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Allow the water to reach a boil.









Stir the coffee occasionally as it comes to a boil.
 Start the timer after the water reaches a full boil. Let the coffee boil for a full two minutes, uncovered, before removing the saucepan from the heat.


As soon as you turn off the heat, the grounds should sink to the bottom of the saucepan.
 If you pour slowly and carefully, the coffee grounds should remain at the bottom of the saucepan, making a strainer unnecessary.









That said, you can still pour the coffee through a strainer if you have one. Doing so will prevent any stray grounds from entering your mug as you pour the coffee.

 Unlace your shoes to expose as much of the white canvas as possible, making it easier to thoroughly clean your sneakers.

You can clean shoelaces separately by letting them soak in a bucket or basin of warm, soapy water, but know that they may never be as bright as they once were. An alternative is to replace your old shoelaces with new ones.
 Dampen your Converse shoes in cold water. You can either rinse them under a running faucet or dunk them into a large bucket or basin of water.

You could moisten the magic eraser instead of the shoe, but making the shoe damp ensures that there will be enough moisture throughout the entire cleaning process.
 Use a “magic eraser” cleaning product to gently scrub the canvas shoes from toe to heel, getting as much of the material as possible.

As one spot of the sponge gets dirty, turn it to another portion of the sponge.
Magic erasers do not use any harsh chemicals, making them especially good options if you have pets or young kids, or if you otherwise prefer to keep chemicals out of your home.
This eraser contains a melamine polymer.It feels flexible and somewhat soft to the touch, but this polymer is actually a rather effective abrasive foam. When you use the eraser, you literally scrape the dirt away with physical force.
 Place the shoes in a warm, sunny, and dry location to dry. Doing so speeds the process up and helps to heighten the whitening effect.


The dry warmth of the sun can help dry the shoes faster, and the light of the sun actually has a mild bleaching effect.
Do not use a dryer. Machine drying white Converse will result in the shoes losing their shape.

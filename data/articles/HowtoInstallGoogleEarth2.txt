 You can download a plugin for your browser that will allow you to view the Google Earth globe inside of webpages, and turn on Earth View in Google Maps. Your computer must meet the Google Earth system requirements (See previous section) and your browser must be one of the following versions or later:


Chrome 5.0+
Internet Explorer 7+
Firefox 2.0+ (3.0+ OS X)
Safari 3.1+ (OS X)

, You can download the Google Earth plugin from Google's website. When you visit the Google Earth website, you will be greeted with the message "Hello, Earth" as well as a random image from Google Maps.
 In the center of the page, there will be two options: Google Earth and Google Earth Pro. The Google Earth plugin is free for everyone.
 The Google Earth plugin page will load immediately. Google will attempt to install the plugin automatically. Depending on your browser settings, you may need to confirm this before it occurs.


Firefox users cannot install the plugin while Firefox is running. This means you will need to install the plugin with another browser. The plugin is universal across all installed browsers.
 Once the plugin is installed, refresh the page you are on (F5). You should see the Google Earth globe load in the middle frame of the page.


You will see a message below the globe informing you that you have the plugin successfully installed.

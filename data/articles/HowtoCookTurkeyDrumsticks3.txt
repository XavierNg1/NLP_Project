 The liquid is necessary to flavor the turkey and help it cook evenly and slowly in the slow cooker. Fill up the slow cooker until the turkey legs are completely submerged.

Or add the following: 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and 1 teaspoon garlic powder.
 Plan ahead so you can time the drumsticks to be ready for your dinnertime.

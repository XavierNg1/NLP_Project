 Political cartoons typically comment on a certain event or issue. If youâ€™re not sure about the issue, check recent news stories to identify the story.
 To give you more reference points, find out the names and roles of the people involved with the issue or event.
 The issue at hand will have different perspectives. If the issue is a war, there might be the pro-war position and the anti-war position. If the issue is a scandal in the news, competing perspectives might support different sides of the scandal.


Keep in mind that there may be more than two perspectives. Most news issues are complex and can have multiple perspectives.
 Find out the background of the issue, how it came about, who is impacted, and so on.


If the political cartoon is historical, find out what some of the main news stories and common beliefs were at the time. This will help deepen your understanding of the cartoon.
 A political cartoon is created with consideration to the experiences and assumptions of the intended audience. What section of the population is the publication geared towards? What country and locality do they live in? What are their political leanings?


For example, a political cartoon in a publication distributed in a strictly conservative tone will convey its message in a different way than it would if the audience was a particularly liberal group.

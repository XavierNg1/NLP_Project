 Marinade can consist of a variety of flavors, including mild, sweet, tangy or hot. Use a mixture of ingredients such as Teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, sweet and sour sauce, tomato sauce or even a little whiskey or beer. Provide a sweet flavor by adding sugar, molasses or honey, then finish the marinade with salt and pepper or your favorite seasonings, along with a small amount of oil to prevent the chicken from sticking to the barbecue grill.

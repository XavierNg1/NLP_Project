 There are many ways to represent pounds when you're not dealing with a whole number. Two common examples are decimals (i.e., 6.5 pounds) and fractions (i.e., 6 1/2 pounds). Another way to do this is with ounces. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so a pound-and-ounces measurement of, for instance, 6 pounds 8 ounces is like saying 6 8/16 pounds (or 6 1/2 pounds).


To convert kilograms into this sort of pound and ounces measurement, start by doing the standard decimal conversion above. For instance, if you want to convert 7 kilograms to pounds and ounces, start by multiplying 7 × 2.2 = 15.4 pounds


, As mentioned above, one ounce is 1/16 of a pound. This is equal to 0.0625 pounds. If you divide the numbers in your answer to the right of the decimal place by 0.0625, the answer you get will be the number of ounces.


For example, if you want to figure out how to write your 15.4 pound answer above to pounds and ounces, you would get your number of ounces by dividing 0.4/0.0625 = 6.4. This means that the "0.4" in "15.4 pounds" is equal to 6.4 ounces.
 Once you know the number of pounds and ounces you're dealing with, getting your final answer is as easy as combining them. Write your answer by listing your number of pounds first, then ounces. For example: 10 pounds, 3 ounces.


In the example problem, we have 15 pounds (from our original 15.4 pound measurement). We now know that the 0.4 decimal is equal to 6.4 ounces. This means our final measurement is 15 pounds, 6.4 ounces.
 Getting from pounds and ounces back to kilograms requires two things. First, you need to convert your ounces back to pounds by multiplying them by 0.0625. Then, you need to convert your pounds back to kilograms by dividing by 2.2 (or whatever other value you used).


In the example problem, you would convert back to kilograms like this:



Start with 15 pounds, 6.4 ounces.
Multiply 6.4 × 0.0625 = 0.4 pounds
Add this to 15 to get 15.4 pounds.
Divide 15.4/2.2 to get 7 kilograms.

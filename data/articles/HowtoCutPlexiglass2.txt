 (Keep the protective paper covering on the sheet.)








,,, Purchase blades that are designed for cutting Plexiglass. If you are cutting more than one sheet at a time, or you are cutting a thick piece of Plexiglass, use a carbide-tipped blade.
 Although a coolant isn’t necessary for sawing most pieces of Plexiglass, using a coolant can give you a much smoother cut.









Combine a few drops of detergent with water in a bottle that has a fine spray mist setting.
Aim the mist against the saw blade. You won’t need to spray the saw blade very much, and probably not at all if you are cutting a small piece.
 The ideal speed for cutting Plexiglass is about 3,450 rpm. The material (Plexiglass sheet) feed rate should be about 4” (10 cm) per second. Keep the speed slow and steady so that you don’t shatter the Plexiglass or cause a jam.
 Use a power saw, wet sander or a drill fitted with a buffer to smooth the edges.

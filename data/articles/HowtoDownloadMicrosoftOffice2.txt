 Once you have found one, check the comments, the number of seeder to make sure that you are not downloading a file that does not work or one that is full of viruses.


Downloading torrents for software that you do not own is illegal in most countries.
 You will need a torrent client such as uTorrent in order to open the torrent file and begin the download. The file will be downloaded once it is opened in the client.
 The files may have been downloaded in ZIP or RAR format, so you may need to extract them before you can start the setup process. If the file is in ISO format, it will need to be burned to a DVD or mounted before you can access it.
 If you don't have a valid product key, Office will not work. If your torrent came with a crack or activation program, run it after installing or copy the product key from the generator.

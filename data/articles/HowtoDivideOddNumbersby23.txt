 Expanded notation is breaking up the number to show the value of each digit, according to its place value.For example, 655=600+50+5{\displaystyle 655=600+50+5}.
 Or, if you have a larger number, begin with the largest place value, such as thousands or ten thousands. You will likely be able to complete this division in your head. If not, you can calculate it quickly by hand. Since the number ends in 0, it is even and will be evenly divisible by 2. Set this quotient aside for now.

For example, 600รท2=300{\displaystyle 600\div 2=300}.
 You will likely be able to do this in your head, but you can also do it by hand if need be. Since the number is a multiple of 10 it will be evenly divisible by 2. Set this quotient aside for now.

For example, 50รท2=25{\displaystyle 50\div 2=25}.  


, Then, divide the even number by 2. You should have no remainder; the remainder is the +1 you removed when you broke up the number.

For example, 5=4+1{\displaystyle 5=4+1}. Now, dividing the even number, you should calculate 4รท2=2{\displaystyle 4\div 2=2}.
 Since you expanded the number into place values, and divided each place value individually by 2, now you have to add them back together again.

For example, 300+25+2=327{\displaystyle 300+25+2=327}.
 Since you removed the remainder of 1 from the ones place before dividing by 2, you now have to take half of that 1 and add it back into your final answer.

For example, 327+0.5=327.5{\displaystyle 327+0.5=327.5}.

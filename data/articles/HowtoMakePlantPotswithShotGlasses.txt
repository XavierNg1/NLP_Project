 Whether freshly bought or used, soak the shot glass in a tub of steaming hot water and soap. Wash off the soap completely. Dry thoroughly before using.
, This step is optional, especially as you might have purchased a shot glass that has a design or brand mark on it already. If you do choose to add a design, use glass suitable paint or markers to ensure that the design stays in place. Leave any design work to dry before proceeding to the next step.

Any design added should be simple. The addition of the decorations and plant risks overwhelming a complex design.
 In the image shown, a ribbon band, bow and a chenille butterfly are added to great effect. Use non-toxic glue when gluing on decorations, to prevent any harm to the plant.
, Choose the plant wisely. It needs to be a plant that can tolerate slightly waterlogged soil as there is no drainage hole and it needs to be a plant that will tolerate the small growing space. (See "Tips" for a drainage hole suggestion.)

This idea works best with succulent plants and cacti as they can tolerate a small, drier growing environment, appreciate misting and won't be hassled out when you transplant them.
 Only mist the plant, to prevent over-watering; the frequency of watering depends on the plant you've chosen. If the plant outgrows the shot glass, transplant it to an appropriate pot and start again.

 Get into your comfiest pajamas and wrap yourself in your softest robe. Sit in your favorite chair and pick up that book you’ve been halfway through for the last three months and finally let yourself relax and read.


If books aren’t really your thing, pick up your favorite magazine, newspaper, or blog and catch up on some lit.
 When pampering yourself, you don’t have to ask anyone’s opinion on what to watch, or argue with anyone about your pick. Instead, watch the movie you’ve been wanting to watch for ages that keeps getting vetoed by your partner or family.


Watch a chick-flick without guilt, or a documentary without being afraid you’re going to bore your friends. This day is all about you after all.
 Meditation is about releasing your worries and allowing yourself to mentally decompress. Find a quiet, calm place, sit down, and close your eyes. Focus on your breathing and let your worries float away from you.


If meditating isn’t really working, practice some breathing exercises. These can help you to release the tension that has built up in your body and will help you to destress.
 Thinking about the things that you are really passionate about can often get swept aside in the madness of the present. When pampering yourself, set aside sometime to consider your life and what you hope to attain.


Create a bucket list, or revisit a past bucket list that you made and consider how your goals have changed (if, indeed, they have).
 Look in the mirror and list everything about yourself that you love. Tell yourself that you are amazing, and that you deserve to be loved. Think of the things you have accomplished, and the experiences you have had.


At the same time, consider the things you would like to improve, without thinking negatively about those things. For example, instead of thinking ‘I suck at managing my time”, tell yourself, “I am going to work harder to manage my time well”, and go buy yourself a fantastic organizer.

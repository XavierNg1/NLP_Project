While you’re trying to quit, try to use nicotine substitutes such as nicotine patches.
 Grinding your teeth, or bruxism, is common – you may not even know that you do it, especially at night. This not only strains the muscles involved in chewing, but also leads to gum recession.Learn to stop grinding your teeth by trying some simple techniques:


See your dentist to get a night guard that stops you from grinding your teeth while you sleep.
Consciously try to unclench your jaw muscles during the day.
Stay away from caffeine and alcohol, especially near bedtime.
Lower your stress with meditation or a soothing bath before bed.
 Metal jewelry placed inside your mouth does not only cause problems with your teeth but also affects your gums. The barbel of tongue and lip piercings tends to hit the gum line repeatedly, and the trauma caused by this ultimately leads to gum recession.If you decide to get an oral piercing, make sure that the piercing shop observes excellent sanitary conditions.
 Gum recession can be caused by partial dentures that fit poorly.If your dentures feel loose or rub on parts of your gums, see your prosthodontist to have your dentures relined (refitted properly).

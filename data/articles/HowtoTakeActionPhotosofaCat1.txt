 It is always best to use natural lighting when shooting action photos. The best lighting occurs when the sun is low in the sky, typically around dawn and dusk. This will give a warm and soft light and you will not see as many shadows. If you are taking pictures inside, position your cat near a window. The light should come from behind the photographer so that it brightens the cat.If you have to shoot during the middle of the day, try and find a shady spot.;
, A flash aimed directly at a cat may distract or even scare them and will result in a red-eye effect. As a result you should avoid using a flash when taking action photos of cats. If a flash is required due to low lighting, make sure to aim the flash upwards into the room and not directly at the cat. This will add light to the image without startling the cat., You should always take photos of your cat in a place where they are completely comfortable. The cat will be relaxed and you will be able to capture it in its favourite environment. For example, your cat may enjoy looking out the window, or scratching on a cat tree. These photos will best capture your catâ€™s personality., Your cat will show up best in a picture if you use a contrasting and simple background. For example, if you have a black cat, you could hang a white sheet for the background. This way your cat will stand out. If the background is patterned or too busy, the cat may blend in rather than stand out.

 Your dermatologist or doctor will be able to point out medications, both topical and in pill form, which may be able to fully treat your breakouts in a matter of weeks.
 Dermabrasion is basically when a doctor scrapes the top layer of skin, or epidermis, with a very fine diamond bur or wire brush, thereby "softening" the irregularities in the skin. It is good for blemishes or scars caused by acne.


Try microdermabrasion. Like dermabrasion, just with a lighter implement. A soft abrasive is moved over the epidermis, softening the blemishes and encouraging collagen production.
 Similar to dermabrasion, except the dermatologist removes the outer layer of skin not by scraping the skin away, but by "planing" it away with a series of back-and-forth oscillations.
 Your local aesthetician will have a high frequency machine that uses a current to kill the bacteria that causes inflamed blemishes. A small electrode is run over the blemish and will be noticeably smaller in a few hours.


You can also purchase a Zeno device, which is the same thing as these high frequency machines. The only difference is that they are handheld and battery operated.
 Your dermatologist can inject cortisone into a blemish, which will reduce swelling within a day. However, this is typically seen as a last resort method for when your skin isn't responding to other treatments

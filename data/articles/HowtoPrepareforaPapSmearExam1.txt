 It is advisable to avoid sexual intercourse for at least 24 hours prior to the test as this may interfere with the results of the test., The exam can place some pressure on your pelvis, which may make you feel like urinating. In order to avoid discomfort, relieve yourself before heading into the exam.

Your doctor will ask you about your cycle, including when your last start and finish date of your period were.Your doctor will also ask you about any pain you experience during your period, whether you have any abnormal discharge, or if you have pelvic pain.
 Because you will have to undress to a certain degree, it is important not to wear clothes that are difficult to get in and out of. You should also consider wearing loose pants or a skirt, as the exam can cause you to feel a little discomfort when it is over.

 Before you can make the step to change careers, you need to take an inventory of your values and what really matters to you. While you may not be able to land your dream job right away, you should have an idea of what it would be.What would you do if money weren’t a factor?
What kind of work environment would be best for you?Where would you like to live? Is relocating something you’d like to do?;
, Changing careers can involve taking a substantial reduction in pay or benefits. That may not be a deal breaker, but you need to determine what you’re capable of financially and what your requirements are.


Consider what money you may have in savings and whether or not it’s enough to cover your major bills as you make a career change.
Determine what your monthly expenses are and the minimum amount of money you can make to cover them.
Calculate how much money you spend on entertainment per month and consider how much of it is necessary. Are you willing to give up your bowling league? Do you eat out more than you need to?

, Determining what you aren’t willing to tolerate can be just as important as figuring out what you want when it comes to making a successful career transition.Consider work environments that you would like to avoid such as “loud places” or “competitive atmospheres.”
Make a list of types of careers you are not interested in. You may have an interest in marketing, but are unwilling to go into sales. That’s an important distinction.

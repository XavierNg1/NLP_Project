 If you make up your mind to quit Facebook, you may need to then figure out how you are going to stick to your decision and avoid getting sucked back into using the site. Try challenging yourself to not going on Facebook for a set number of days, such as 50 days straight with no Facebook or 100 days with no Facebook. Putting a set number on your time away can help you stay motivated and stick to your choice.You may write a daily reminder on your calendar or in your phone so you can keep track of how many days you have been off Facebook. Give yourself a pat on the back for every day you stay off of Facebook to stay motivated.
 Delete your Facebook account on your computer and on your smartphone. Then, work on communicating with others through email, text, phone calls, or meet ups in real life. Make an effort to connect to others outside of Facebook so you do not lose touch with your loved ones. Having other ways of communicating will also ensure you are not tempted to go back on Facebook.For example, you may set up a weekly coffee date with a friend so you can catch up outside of Facebook, in real life. Or you may start an email chain with family so you can still keep in touch online, but off Facebook.
 Now that you are no longer on Facebook, you have a lot of time freed up to focus on your hobbies or interests. Take up a hobby that you were always too busy to try. Or delve more into an interest you have never had time for because you were always glued to Facebook. Fill your time with things that will be fulfilling and meaningful to you, especially now that you have more time on your hands.For example, you may take up a hobby like writing, reading, painting, or drawing. Or you may try recreational sports or join a social justice club to fill your time in more meaningful ways.

 Ich parasites may not be very visible when they first start to form. But once they start to feed on the bodily fluids of your fish’s skin and fins, they will encyst themselves and show up as small flecks or white spots. It may look that your goldfish has been dusted with salt or sugar, but in fact, they are suffering from ich.If you don’t notice the ich treatment early, it may develop into large white patches on your fish’s scales and fins. This is a sign more ich parasites have attached to your goldfish.;
, The goldfish ich will cause your goldfish to, well, itch! He may brush his body against objects in the tank or against the sides of the tank in an effort to stop the itch., Because your goldfish is under distress, he may not be getting enough oxygen in the tank. This will cause his gills to go into overdrive and lead to heavy and rapid movement of his gills as he tries to breath.

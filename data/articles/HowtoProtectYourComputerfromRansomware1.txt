 When used strategically, an external hard drive is among the most effective backup tools at your disposal. Only plug it into your machine when you back up files, and go offline during backups.If you keep your external drive connected to the computer while it’s online, it could become hijacked along with your computer during a ransomware attack.;
, If you store your files with a service, like Carbonite, Dropbox, or Onenote, you’ll most likely be able to restore any files hijacked during a ransomware attack. Just make sure your cloud storage service allows you to access earlier versions of your files, so you can recover the files as they were prior to the ransomware attack.Dropbox, for example, allows you to track changes made to all files within 30 days.
 If you don’t already have one, create a consistent backup routine. If you work with important files every day, back them up on an external drive or with a cloud storage provider daily.If you save copies of all of your files frequently, you won’t have to worry about losing them during a ransomware attack.

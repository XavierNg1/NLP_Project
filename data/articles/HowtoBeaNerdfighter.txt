 Originally founded around John and Hank's Brotherhood 2.0, nerdfighters now continue to rally around vlogging. John and Hank (known as the "Vlogbrothers" on YouTube) currently post new videos every Tuesday and Friday.;
, His books, including "Looking for Alaska", "An Abundance of Katherines", "Paper Towns", (with fellow author David Levithan) "Will Grayson, Will Grayson", and "The Fault in Our Stars". All of his books have received outstanding recognition.
 Hank has released three studio albums, 'So Jokes', 'This Machine Pwns N00bs', and 'Ellen Hardcastle'. For much of the project, Hank has posted a new song every Wednesday. In addition to performing, Hank is also the co-founder of the DFTBA record label.
 This can only be truly achieved by watching their videos, and even then can be very confusing. The most important things to know, though, are the nerdfighter mantra ("Don't Forget To Be Awesome" - "DFTBA") and the nerdfighters hand sign.
 Do your part to fight all the things in the world that suck. Common causes taken up by nerdfighters include World Vision, Save the Children, and The Uncultured Project. Also, once a year, nerds band together to participate in the annual Project For Awesome, which contributes to hundreds of charities.
 Common virtual watering holes include 'The Ning', the nerdfighter forums titled "Your Pants", and YouTube comments sections. Nerdfighters also frequently meet up locally, with each other, and occasionally with John and/or Hank.
 The nerdfighter community is ever-growing and -changing, with new additions with every new vlog post. The best way to stay on top of what's going on is to subscribe the the Vlogbrothers YouTube channel, follow John and Hank on Twitter, and keep up with news and content from community sites such as the Eff Yeah Nerdfighters Tumblr.

 Boil a large pot of water, salting it generously as it heats up to bring out the best taste of the pasta. Many Italian chefs insist that the water should almost taste like the ocean-- almost 4 tablespoons (60 ml). Remove when "al dente:" still firm, but without any crunch., Remember -- starchy pasta water is one of the best ways to thin up a sauce right before serving. Use a ladle to remove some of the starchy water and set aside before draining the water from the pasta.
 Restaurants always "finish" the pasta and sauce together instead of simply ladling them into the same bowl. This ensures that everything melds and blends together instead of having a plate of plain spaghetti on top of a puddle of sauce., Add 1-2 tablespoons of pasta water along with the sauce to thin it out slightly. Furthermore, starchy water helps the sauce stay bound to the pasta instead of polling at the bottom.
 If the meatballs were roasted separately, you can add one more on top as well for an attractive, centerpiece dish. After marrying the flavors in the pan, serve everything right out of the pan.

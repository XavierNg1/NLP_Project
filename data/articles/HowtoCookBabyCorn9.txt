 Arrange the baby corn in a single layer inside a shallow, microwave-safe dish. Pour the water over the corn.


Loosely cover the dish with its lid or with a sheet of microwave-safe plastic wrap.
 Cook the baby corn on high power until it becomes tender-crisp.


The exact cooking time will vary depending on the type and size of the baby corn. Canned baby corn has already been pre-cooked, so it should be done within 2 minutes. Smaller portions of frozen or fresh baby corn may require 3 or 4 minutes, while larger portions might need the full 7 minutes. Check the corn at 1 to 2 minute intervals to avoid cooking it past the tender-crisp stage.
 Drain the cooking water and serve the baby corn while it's still hot.


You can serve the baby corn with melted butter, if desired.
Store leftovers in an airtight container. Refrigerate for up to one or two days.

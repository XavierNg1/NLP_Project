 This look is very polished, but it will also keep you quite warm, especially if you pull the loop up higher so that it sits right under your chin. Tie your scarf into the loop and put on your favorite jacket. Button or zip your jacket up about halfway. Arrange the loop so that it gathers close to the collar. Tuck the front part of the scarf into your half-zipped jacket.For an even more polished look, wear a beanie that matches your scarf.
 Arrange your scarf into the cape look, making sure both ends are pulled over your shoulders to the front. Wrap your favorite belt loosely around your waist, capturing the scarf in front, beneath the belt. Choose a scarf with a pattern, such as plaid, and keep the rest of your look very simple – for example, black skinny jeans and a black long-sleeved top.Experiment with different belts to find your favorite look. Skinny belts look great, but so do wider belts.
If you like, you can cross the ends of the scarf in the front, beneath the belt, for a wrapped look.
 Tie your scarf with the most basic method – essentially, do the loop but don’t tuck the ends into the loop. Let them hang over both shoulders instead. Fluff the scarf up a bit for more volume. Wear it with baggy cargo pants and a loose-fitting shearling coat.Pair this look with trainers or vintage sneakers.
Make this look even more trendy by cuffing the bottoms of the pant legs just above the ankle.
 Scarves with fringed ends can look especially stylish when tied in the bandana/kerchief look. This look can go with any outfit you choose. Select a scarf that is within the same color palette as the rest of your clothing. This will neatly tie your overall look together.

 A wonderful way to feel good about accepting help is to become a helper in some way. Research shows that those who move on from receiving help to giving help feel more confident.Giving back in your local community through volunteerism offers you an opportunity to pay it forward.


Remember that any volunteerism should be about the act of giving and not about being paid back or lifted up as a result of it.
Get involved with a local civic organization, religious or spiritual group, or dedicate your time to assisting children, the elderly, or animals in your area.
 Flexing your facial muscles is a great way to accept help and make others feel good in turn. Smiles are contagious. They move from one person to another, and can have an astounding impact on someone’s day.Make it your business to send your goodwill back out into the world by greeting those you meet with a smile. The postman, your boss, the crosswalk attendant at your kid’s school—everyone can benefit from a friendly greeting.
 If you have a few extra dollars, you can make a difference by donating to a worthy cause that matters to you. By giving in this way you can profit by enjoying a brighter mood, feeling gratitude, helping those in need, and sparking that giving chain.If you don’t have the money to donate, find creative ways to help out a cause you care about. Request that loved ones donate in your name for birthdays or graduation. Or, inspire a group of your friends or family to compile their money to make a large donation instead of exchanging gifts on holidays.
Make it a seasonal practice to donate by giving usable items to small local organizations. Be cautious of where you donate money to. Find out how organizations will use the money and choose the one that will use the money most effectively. You can also bring gifts to local shelters or offer to help to cook/cater meals for your local shelters.

 Sit down and lean forward to put pressure on your abdominal muscles, as though you had a bowel movement. The tense muscles, in turn, will put pressure on your bladder., While leaning forward, lay your forearm across your lower abdomen and press gently. Do not press directly on your bladder, which could cause backflow to your kidneys., Repeatedly tap your bladder with your fingers, below your navel. Tap about a little faster than once per second, for thirty seconds.If necessary, shift around to find the best spot, and keep up the tapping until a steady stream has begun.
 Stroking your inner thigh or tugging on a pubic hair may trigger the nerves that control the bladder.

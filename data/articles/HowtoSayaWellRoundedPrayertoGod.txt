 Thank God for your family, well being, everything you own, safety, love and affection, everything in your life, and Jesus because he gave up his life so we could meet God in Heaven.;
, Make sure if you sinned against someone, you ask for their forgiveness, also. Ask humbly for God's forgiveness for the sins you mentioned and all the sins you have committed.
 Do this the whole way through. You can fill in the blank with worldly things, family things, or what ever you pray for. Example: "I pray for everyone who has been hurt in natural or human made disasters."

, Ask Him to help you act on promises or to not do something anymore. Example: "Dear God, Please help me think before I do something."

, Thank him for listening to your prayers and forgiving you. Praise him for his deeds and love.
 Asking God for things you want can be hard so start off with things that are not relating to you personally. Example: "Lord please let my kids not fight." After you do this ask God for things you personally want. Example: "Please God let me get a good job."

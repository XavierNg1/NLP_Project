 There are over 800 myki retailer locations in Victoria, including all 7-Eleven stores; the ticket office window at Premium Stations and all staffed V/Line commuter stations; and the myki machines that you can find at all train stations and major tram and bus stops. Once you find a retailer, navigate the machine or ask the store clerk for a myki card. Pay for the cost of the card and any additional funds that you want to add to your balance.


A concession myki costs $7, and a full fare myki costs $10. In some places, you can buy a myki pack for $15, which includes the cost of the card and $5.00 myki money credit on it. The retailer should be able to add funds to your card when you buy it.
You can also purchase a myki from the myki Discovery Centre at Southern Cross Station and at Flinders St Station.;

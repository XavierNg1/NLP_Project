 Refer to the list above to learn the days of the week in French, along with how they are pronounced.Note that the days of the week are not capitalized in French.


Monday: lundi (luh(n)-dee)

Tuesday: mardi (mahr-dee)

Wednesday: mercredi (mehr-kruh-dee)

Thursday: jeudi (zhuh-dee)

Friday: vendredi (vah(n)-druh-dee)

Saturday: samedi (sahm-dee)

Sunday: dimanche (dee-mah(n)sh)

, This is identical to writing the date, with the day of the week added to the front of the phrase. Here's an example:


English: Wednesday, the 5th of June
French (written): mercredi, le 5 juin 2001 (formal)
French (written): mercredi 5 juin 2001 (normal)
French (spoken): mercredi cinq juin deux mille un

French (spoken): le mercredi cinq juin deux mille un (eventually if you want to describe a precise day)

, Every day of the week is a masculine noun, so the article le is used.For example, "Le samedi est le sixième jour." means "Saturday is the sixth day." However, when you are talking about an event that occurred on a specific day, know the difference between le samedi and samedi:Samedi, je dîne au restaurant. = On Saturday, I dine at a restaurant. (A single event.)

Le samedi, je dîne au restaurant. = Every Saturday, I dine at a restaurant. (A repeated event.)

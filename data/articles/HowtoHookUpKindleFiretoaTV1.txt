Both your Kindle Fire HD and your Fire TV must be on the same wireless network and signed into the same Amazon profile.;
, You won't see your Kindle Fire HD's screen here yet, since you'll need to enable screencasting on your Amazon Kindle HD tablet.

You must adjust your TV's input to display the channel to which your Fire TV device is connected (e.g., HDMI 3).
 Doing so will bring down the quick options menu., This gear is in the top-right corner of the screen., It's toward the bottom of the screen., This option is near the bottom of the screen.If you can't find Display Mirroring on this page, your Kindle Fire HD doesn't support screencasting.
 You'll see it appear beneath the "Devices" heading in the middle of the screen. If you see "Mirroring" appear below the TV's name, you're successfully casting your Kindle Fire HD's screen to the TV.

If you see the TV's name but cannot connect, try sitting closer to the TV or removing objects that obstruct the Fire Box's signal.

, If you play in pairs, the other member of your team (usually the "foot") should know what cards you have without the others finding out. Through a series of gestures, you should let your teammate know at the beginning of the round what hand of cards you've been dealt.

1 of swords: raise your eyebrows
1 of clubs: wink an eye
7 of swords: move your lips to the right
7 of coins: move your lips to the left
3: bite your lower lip
2: pucker your lips as if you were giving someone a kiss
1 of cups/1 of coins: open your mouth
All other cards: close your eyes (this means you don't have any valuable cards)

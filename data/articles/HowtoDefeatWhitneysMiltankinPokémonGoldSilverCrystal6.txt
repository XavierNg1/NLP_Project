 Preferably, a female one, since a female one will be immune to Attract. You can trade a Bellsprout for Onix in Violet City, or catch one in Union Cave. Geodude can also be caught in Union Cave, along with Dark Cave and the bottom part of Route 46.
 Both Geodude and Onix are Rock/Ground-types and have high defense, making them a good choice to use against Whitney.

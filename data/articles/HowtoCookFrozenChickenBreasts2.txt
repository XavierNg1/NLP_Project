 You can sear and cook frozen chicken on the stovetop whole but dicing or cutting it into strips will allow for quicker cooking time.


You can use the microwave to thaw the chicken a bit to make it easier to cut it up, but always use microwaved chicken right away.
 You can apply a seasoning mix, a sauce, or a salt-and-pepper rub before freezing the chicken or while it is thawing as it cooks.


You can also cook the chicken in a broth to add more flavor and prevent the meat from drying out.
Keep in mind seasoning put directly on frozen chicken will not absorb into the meat.
 Use olive oil, vegetable oil, or butter.Turn the pan to medium high heat and let the oil warm up or the butter melt.
Add in any broth, like chicken or veggie broth, if you are using it.
 Keep the temperature at medium heat. Cover the pot so the breasts can cook.
 Try not to lift the lid and peek at the chicken as this allows heat to escape.


Like baking the frozen chicken, cooking the chicken will still take 50 percent longer to cook than if it were thawed.
After 2-4 minutes of cooking, add in any spices or seasonings to the chicken.
 Use kitchen tongs to do this.
 Set a timer for 15 minutes and let the chicken simmer. Again, avoid lifting the lid to peek at the chicken.
 Once the chicken has cooked for 15 minutes, you need to let it sit.
 Take the lid off and check if the chicken is done by using a meat thermometer. The chicken should be at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit.


Make sure there is no pink in the middle of the chicken breasts.

 If you have thick hair and you've gone months without cleaning it, you may have a matted layer of hair to remove from your brush. The easiest way to take care of this issue is with a sharp pair of scissors. Insert the tip of the scissors at the edge of the mat of hair and carefully snip in a straight line through the bristles and across the brush. Do this a few more times so that you've separated the mat into sections. Use your fingers to lift the individual sections from the brush, then discard them.









Be sure not to accidentally snip any bristles as you're cutting.
Don't poke the scissors into the body of the brush or you may scratch it.
 You can use any soap-based agent to clean your brush. Mix dish soap, shampoo, body wash, or hand soap with some water. Stir it up so that the mixture begins to foam a bit.
 Dip the toothbrush in the soapy water and use it to scrub in between the bristles. Scrub each area of the brush for several seconds to make sure it gets completely clean. When you're finished with the base of the brush, run the toothbrush along the bristles, too.









Be careful not to bend or break any bristles while you're scrubbing.
Use a soft toothbrush, rather than a stiff one, so that you won't damage the surface of your brush.
 Run the brush under warm water to rinse away the dirt and soapy water. Examine the brush to determine if it seems clean enough. If necessary, use the toothbrush to give it another scrub.
 Use the cold setting on your hair dryer to dry the brush, or lay it on a towel and let it dry overnight. Your hairbrush is ready to use when it's completely dry.

 A 30-day lunge challenge is a great way to practice all types of lunges and get a great workout on a regular basis. Having a specific goal in mind when exercising can at times, increase your motivation. Before you get started, however, you’ll need to select a 30-day period that works best for you. Using an actual calendar month will probably be the most convenient and easiest to follow., Ideally, you should perform some lunges on a daily basis, but you don’t need to perform all 100 every day right from day one. Start by performing 20 – 30 lunges per day until you can build up your endurance; however, try to fit in at least 100 lunges every week.
 Once you’ve built up some endurance and energy, try to perform all 100 lunges every day. The lunges can be broken down as follows:








30 forward lunges, 15 for each leg
40 side lunges, 20 to each side
30 reverse lunges, 15 for each leg

, Keep track of the number of lunges you do every day, and which lunges you were able to perform. Even if you are not able to work your way up to 100 lunges a day, by tracking your progress you’ll be able to see how much you’ve improved over the 30 days.Regardless of your progress, reward yourself with something at the end of the 30 days. Keep that reward in mind throughout the 30 days as an incentive to keep going. (If you're trying to lose weight, don't reward yourself with food. A movie, a new book or an afternoon walk in the park are better rewards.)

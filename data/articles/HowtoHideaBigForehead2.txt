 Use a bronzer along your hairline that’s a shade darker than your foundation to create the impression of a smaller forehead. Don’t forget to blend the bronzer into your foundation well with a makeup blending sponge or brush to make sure that it looks natural., Use bold eyeshadows and eyeliners to accentuate your eyes and make them the focal point. Eye makeup can also influence others’ perception of your face shape.For a dramatic nighttime look, go for a smoky eye look by applying a deep gray eyeshadow with a touch of glitter on the eyelid and a small amount of black eyeshadow just under the outer corner of the browbone. Finish off the look by creating a cat eye with your liquid eyeliner.
 Select a bright colored peachy or rosy toned blush and apply it to your cheekbones with a blush brush. Try also applying blush upwards toward the temple to seemingly lift your face and reduce the size of your forehead.

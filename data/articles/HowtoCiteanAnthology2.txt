 Typically, you'll need to cite an individual work within the anthology instead of citing the entire book. Use the last name of the work's author, the work's original publication date, and the publication date of the entire anthology.Typical Form: (A.LastName, OriginalYear/ReprintYear)

Example: (Smith, 2012/2015)

, If you need to cite information provided by the editor of an anthology, you should use the editor's name instead of using an author from the book. Cite the anthology's publication year, as well.



Typical Form: (E.LastName, Year)

Example: (Doe, 2015)

, When pulling information from a specific work within the anthology, you should write an entry that uses the author and publication information specific to that work.


Unlike MLA format, you should not cross-reference multiple works found in one anthology. Provide the full publication information for each work.

Typical Form: ALastName, AFirstInitial. (ReprintYear). Title of work. In EFirstInitial ELastName (Ed.), Title of anthology (page range). City of Publication: Publisher. (Original work published in OriginalYear)

Example: Smith, S. (2015). Interesting story. In J. Doe (Ed.), A collection of interesting stories (194-198). New York: Great Publishing Company. (Original work published in 2012).
 Cite the entire anthology only when you use information provided by the editor of that anthology, rather than information provided by a specific work within the book.


You should also clarify that the name is that of the editor by including the abbreviation “Ed.” in parentheses.

Typical Form: ELastName, EFirstInitial. (Ed.) (Year). Title of anthology. City of Publication: Publisher.

Example: Doe, J. (Ed.) (2015). A collection of interesting stories. New York: Great Publishing Company.

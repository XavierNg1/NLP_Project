 How you purchased your Betta can tell you a little about his or her sex. Male bettas are typically sold exclusively in the typical "pet store" because of their bright colors and large fins. These are typically male traits, and, consequently, most pet stores sell and stock only male Bettas. Female Bettas are typically sold by aquarium enthusiasts or higher-end aquarium stores.


Many pet store staffers are more knowledgeable about pets than you. However, their expert knowledge may be limited by their own pet interests. When consulting a pet store staff worker about the sex of a Betta, consider asking if they have ever personally bred Bettas, or if they have to look at the label before telling you if a Betta is male or female. When in doubt, assume the fish is male.
 They create hundreds or thousands of little tiny bubbles that group together. This is in preparation for tending to fertilized eggs. Male Bettas typically tend to be the primary caregivers for their offspring.
 Usually the beard is brown or black in coloration. Males tend to have larger beards than females. You may only be able to see the female's beard with when her gills are closed if you look hard enough. Males tend to be more obvious even when the gills are open.

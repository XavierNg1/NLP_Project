 How far you fold it depends on your preference. Nonetheless, it should be folded approximately in half lengthwise.If you use a twin or a full sheet, you don't need to fold the toga.








If you fold it exactly in half, you will make a very short toga.For a longer toga, don't go all the way down when folding it. Just fold it partway.Remember, togas were generally worn over tunics, so you can wear it over a shirt or some other type of garment or even your regular clothes. Using a sheet, in particular, creates a fairly skimpy toga, so you probably want to wear something under it.
 You can drape the whole edge over the left arm. This end will hang down in front.Another option is just draping the the top corner over so it forms a point.








If you're draping the toga yourself, the easiest way to do this step is to throw the whole sheet over your shoulders like a cape, lengthwise. On your left side, pull it so just the end is hanging over your arm, then pull up the slack on the other side., Now that you've got it draped on the left side, pull it under your right arm.You can leave it over your right arm, as the Romans sometimes wore togas almost like a sling, but you'll have more movement if you pull it under.








Try to gently pleat the part that goes under your arm. That is, when it comes around your hip from the back, use your hands to fold the fabric back and forth, so it drapes in small folds., Finally, take the end and push it over your left shoulder. Try to get as much of it over your shoulder, while still pulling the right side down over your hip somewhat.








Though the Romans didn't usually pin their togas, you can use a safety pin to pin it at the shoulder. That way, it won't slip off.

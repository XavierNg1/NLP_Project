 The general cost statewide is $25.


Call ahead to the clerk's office to get the hours of operation as well as confirm what method of payment that they accept. You don't want to show up with just a check or credit card and find out that they only take cash.
You don't have to be a resident of Wyoming to obtain your marriage license, and your Wyoming marriage license is valid statewide.
In Wyoming, there is neither a waiting period after the application nor after the license has been granted.
If either of you is under the age of 18 years, you will need parental consent. Anyone under the age of 16 years will require a court order to obtain a marriage license.
For those no longer with a previous spouse, be sure you know the date of death or divorce, and bring along a copy of your spouse's death certificate or your divorce papers.
Once you get your Wyoming marriage license, it does not expire. So you are better off planning-wise going ahead and taking care of this step sooner rather than later.;

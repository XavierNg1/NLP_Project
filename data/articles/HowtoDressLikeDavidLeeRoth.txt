, He is well known for his over-the-top outfits.
 He wears spandex pants almost all of the time.
 However, platforms are a good option and are very "Dave". Anything shiny will work.
 T-shirts, button-downs, anything. In some music videos, he wears a t-shirt layered with a mesh top.
, He wears a Van Halen necklace, but sometimes defects and wears a big "D" pendant on a chain. The more necklaces, bracelets, rings, the better. Scarves are also a big part of his wardrobe. He also always wears a bandana tied around his wrist,and also sometimes wears bandanas on his leg and around his neck, sometimes several at a time.
 It is long and flowing, dyed a brilliant shade of blond. If you don't want to dye the whole thing blond, just dye a stripe down the back blond. The latter is how Dave wore his hair as a teen; the skunk stripe.

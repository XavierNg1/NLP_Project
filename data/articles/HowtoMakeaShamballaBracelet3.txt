 After finishing the last knot, turn the bracelet over.

Tie a very strong knot using the two outside cords.
Add a dab of strong glue to strengthen the knot. Allow to dry for at least an hour, or as suggested by the packaging.
Repeat on the other side.
 Leave the middle cord uncut. The two middle cords at either end of the bracelet should now be the only cords left.

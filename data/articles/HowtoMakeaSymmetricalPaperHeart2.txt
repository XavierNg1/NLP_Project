 Give it to someone or incorporate it into a larger craft project. If Valentine's Day is coming up, then a paper heart can make a great simple gift for someone you like. However, don't be afraid to do this at any time of year!








, Turn the heart into a card by writing sweet words on it and folding it together. You can even paste the card to a larger, rectangular card, and then write your words in the heart. Write a note to someone that you like.









For a playful card, write, "Will you be my Valentine?" or "I think you're awesome."
For a more serious card, write something like, "I love you," or "I give my heart to you." Make sure you're giving it to someone who will receive this news well!

, Stick the paper heart to a card or poster. Use tape or tack to attach it to your wall or window. Use it as a piece in a pop-up book. Get creative!

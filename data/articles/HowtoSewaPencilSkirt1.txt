 You will need to have basic sewing materials and fabric before you begin creating your skirt. Here is a list of items you will need:About one yard of fabric
Sewing machine or sewing needles and thread
Zipper
Fabric scissors
Clear protractor
Ruler
Fabric tape measure
Paper
Pencil;
, The trick to a perfect pencil skirt is making sure you have all the right measurements to ensure a good fit. The four main measurements you need are your waist, hip, leg circumference and total length.Your natural waist is the smallest part of your torso.
Your hip measurement needs to be taken around the widest part of your butt.
Measure around your legs where you want the pencil skirt to end. This can be either just above the knees or right below the knees for a traditional pencil skirt style.
Measure the length starting from your natural waist and down to the point you want the skirt to end.
 While you want to have accurate measurements, you need to add room for the seam allowance, and give yourself enough room to walk and sit. A pencil skirt will have three seams that each require 5/8" for the seam allowance. In addition, you will want to add about 1/2" to 3/4" ease at the waistline, and about 2" to 2 3/4" wearing ease at the hips., The fabric is completely up to you. You can choose cotton, wool, polyester, or any material you would like to create your skirt. Just be sure that you understand the washing instructions of each fabric so that you can properly care for your skirt.


Inspect the fabric you want to use to see how much give the material has. This will give you a better idea of how it will wear and fit on your body.

 Generally, the newer the video game, the better it is - but there are a few exceptions. The central version is usually better than the dual games that came before it. Such as:


Pokémon Yellow
Pokémon Crystal
Pokémon Emerald
Pokémon Platinum;
, Your starters are always good ways to judge a video game. When you're looking at the starters, ask yourself - "Do I like the appearance of this starter?" "What are the moves that this starter learns - and do I like them?" etc.
 Graphics are a good portion of the qualities of Pokémon games. Despite this, a video games can still be a great game even if it has a small bit-count. Sonic The Hedgehog 2, to name one.
 You might even want to read up on the gym leaders (in Pokémon Sun and Moon, there are trial captains instead of gym leaders) and landscapes of the game you wish to play.
 For example, if you want to pick Torchic as your starter, you might be better off buying Sapphire instead of Ruby to avoid having 2 fire types in your team.

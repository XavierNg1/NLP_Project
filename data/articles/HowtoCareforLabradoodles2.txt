 Your Labradoodle’s curly fur coat will need to be brushed weekly to keep out the mats. His fur may be anywhere from wavy to tightly curly, so the amount of mats that may develop in it will vary depending on the texture.


If his hair is really curly, you may need to brush is twice a week.
While you are brushing him, look for fleas, ticks, lumps, scraps, scabs, bumps, or any other skin abnormalities.
When he is going from puppy to adult dog, you will need to brush out his fur more often. His softer puppy hair will start to tangle with the adult curly hair and may cause problems if left alone too long., While your Labradoodle is still a puppy, you can start taking him to the groomers every few weeks or months so he gets used to it. After he is about a year old, he will need to be taken to the groomers every four to six months to get a fur trim.


Many owners like to take their Labradoodle to the groomers in between these visits, about every four to six weeks, to maintain his coat, have his nails looked at, and have him bathed.
 Since your Labradoodle is a large dog, he may not need to have his nails trimmed every week. However, you should look at them every week when you brush him. Check for any soreness, broken nails, or any that need to be trimmed.


If his nails do need to be trimmed, make sure you watch out for the quick of the nails, which will be pink, because it is where the nerves and blood vessels are.
If you take him to the groomer every four to six weeks, they can take care of his nails when they need to be trimmed., Your Labradoodle’s teeth are important, so you need to brush them once a week. Start by using your finger with dog toothpaste, then move up to a gentle pass with a dig toothbrush the next day, then finally get to where you can brush all his teeth the day after that. It will get easier as he gets used to the process.


Never use human toothpaste on a dog because it is toxic.

If you have "Hey Siri" enabled, simply say "Hey Siri" to open Siri.
 Siri will tell you the sunset time for your current location.You can ask about the time of the sunset in a different location by asking, "What time is the sunset in ?"
If you want to know what time the sunset was, but it's already after dark, ask, "What time did the sun set today?"
Siri may not be able to predict the sunrise and sunset times outside of the scope of a couple of weeks from when you ask.

 This is a very common way of giving thanks in Hindi, but it's not very formal. This means you should use it mainly for your friends and family. If you're talking to someone like a boss or teacher, an authority figure, or an elder, you'll probably want to use one of the phrases above. Pronounce this word in three parts:First, say "shook." Make this syllable a little shorter and tighter than you'd normally say the English word.
Next, say "ree." Here, again, the Hindi r sound is a delicate flick of the tongue like the Spanish r sound â€” this should should sound almost like "dee."
End with "ah." The sound you use here should be somewhere between "uh" and "ah." It may take a little practice to get this right.
All together, this should sound like "shook-dee-ah." Nailing the r/d sound is important here. You may want to try pronouncing it like "shook-uh-dee-ah", then gradually working to shrink that "uh" sound until it's nothing more than a flick of the tongue.
 You can use "bahut" here the same way as you did above to change your basic "thank you" to "thank you very much" or "thanks a lot." Though you're expressing more gratitude here, this is still considered informal.


Bahut is pronounced the same way as in the section above: "buh-HUT."

, Hindi, like almost every language, borrows words and phrases from other languages. This Hindi loan word is pronounced exactly like "thank you" in English (because it obviously is English in origin). Because this isn't really "pure" Hindi, it's considered less formal than the options in the seconi above.


It's also worth noting that English is one of the official languages of India, so much of the population will likely be familiar with this phrase even if they don't speak English fluently.

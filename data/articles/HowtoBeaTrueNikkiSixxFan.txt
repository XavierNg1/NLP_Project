 Listen to every Motley Crüe song until you know them by heart, watch the music videos, etc.;
,,, Google him and learn as much as the internet can let you.
 These books would help you understand Nikki much better and learn more than what the internet alone can teach you. By reading the diaries you would understand why is it important to listen to Sixx a.m. and the meaning of their songs. At this moment you can stop and say “I don’t want to be a fan of an ex-drug addict rockstar” but you also have to understand the reasons why he started doing drugs in the first place. By reading his journal and “The dirt” you will understand some of the reasons why he started using drugs.
 And most importantly: learn to play Motley Crüe and Sixx:a.m. songs. If you already know how to play an instrument, try to learn the songs that they play. But remember: Nikki Sixx is a bassist so it is better if you play bass.
 If someone asks you “What are you listening to?” just tell them “I’m listening to Girls Girls Girls” or whatever song you are listening to.
, Do whatever you can to show your love for Vince, Mick, Tommy and specially Nikki Sixx.
 Try to be a little bit more like Nikki, a true fan would not change his/her whole life just to be like him, but if you like how he is and it fits your personality, go ahead! Don’t feel forced to change your religion. Nikki believes in God, even if he is not from a specific religion, so he started doing a lot of satanic stuff when he did “shout at the devil” because he thought that it looked cool. But even he says that it wasn’t his smartest idea, so don’t do it.
 Nikki also loves to buy antiques. If you can't afford antiques just hit the garage sales.
 . Johnny Thunders is a big deal for him.
 A lot of people will trash him and say crap about him, so be ready to tell them to back off.

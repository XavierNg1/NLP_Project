 You only need enough water to cover the lid when you turn the jar upside down into the water pot. Turn off the heat when the water is hot.








Hot tap water will also do the trick, especially if the jar is cold to start. Fill a small bowl with enough hot tap water to cover the lid.
Or you can simply run hot tap water over the lid, making sure it doesn't touch the rest of the jar.
 Make sure the lid is submerged, but the jar itself is not covered in hot water. The hot water will make the lid expand temporarily and break the seal. Let the lid sit for one to two minutes, until you hear the seal pop open.
 Hold the jar upright, wipe off the water, and open it up. The lid should screw off easily once the seal has been popped. The heat may have melted the contents of the jar.

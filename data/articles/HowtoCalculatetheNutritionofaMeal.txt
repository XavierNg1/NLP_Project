, Most people, when they go out to eat or even eat at home, eat the same things. This allows the diner, sometimes, to know ahead of time, and arm themselves with the required knowledge.


Once you have a basic understanding of nutritional values, you won't have to research every meal.
 A basic hamburger would be the bun, the hamburger and cheese. You could go to the restaurant's website to get the information, or research each component.


Hamburger patty - Calories: 209, Total Fat: 14g, Carbs: 0g, Protein: 20g
Hamburger bun - Calories: 120, Total Fat: 2g, Carbs: 23g, Protein: 4g
Cheese slice - 2 ounces; Calories: 100, Total Fat: 1g, Carbs: 1g, Protein: 3g
and the infamous question: do you want fries with that?

1 large (169.0 g); Calories: 200, Total Fat: 31.1g, Carbs: 67.3g, Protein: 7.27g


So, a basic cheeseburger with fries (no beverage) would be 529 calories, 47.1g of total fat, 54.4 g of Carbs, and 31.27g of protein. The requirement varies from person to person. Check this site outto see what yours are.
Add to this, a 16 ounce cola beverage, and you add 200 more calories. You now have, easily, one third of your 'daily allotment' of calories and it is on one meal (if that is all you have).

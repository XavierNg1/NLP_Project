 With a spoolie, lash comb or fine toothed comb, sweep eyebrow hair straight upward and pin it in place one section at a time. Trim a small amount off of any large hairs.


Repeat this process a second time, this time combing down instead of up.;
, Take a piece of high-cotton sewing thread about as long as your forearm and tie it to form a loop. Snip off loose ends.


You want thin thread, usually found cheaply at a drug store.
 Each hand will be on opposite sides of the string.
 The string will now look a little like an "8." This small bit of braided string in the middle will be used to pluck your hairs.With your hands apart in front of you, the string should now look similar to an "X" with the twisted portion in the middle.
Note how, if you pinch or close the thumb and finger on one hand, the braided section moves back and forth.
 This will make your hairs stand out more. Lightly powder below and above your eyebrow.
 The corners on each end of the twisted thread will be grabbing your hairs almost like scissors, but rather than shearing, the twisted thread will fold hair into itself, plucking individual hairs at your own pace, depending on how fast you open and close your fingers.


You want to keep your thumbs/finger on the corners of the string.
 Place the thread on the skin with the twisted portion of the thread just to the side of the hair you would like to remove. Gently move the twisted portion along the skin from side to side to capture the hairs, either to the right or to the left whichever way feels more comfortable, by doing what we learned in step 4. Once hairs are captured, simply pull.
 Keep threading until your eyebrows are their desired shape. Go slowly when you first start to prevent pulling out large chunks of hair undesirably.
 This will ease some of the pain from pulling up the hairs and prevent redness. Your eyebrows will usually stay nice and clean for 2-3 weeks!

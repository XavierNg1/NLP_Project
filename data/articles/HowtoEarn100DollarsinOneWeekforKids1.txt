 There are a million things you could help your neighbors do, especially if they're elderly. If your parents give you the okay, go knocking on some doors and ask, but have a few ideas in mind. Sometimes people don't know what they need! Here's some ideas to get you started:


Wash cars
Mow and edge lawns
Weed the garden
Organize the recycling
Weekly things, such as taking out the trash.;
, Since you're next door, you can easily walk over to a neighbor's house and watch over it while they're gone. They can then go worry-free about their business, knowing their house is safe. Talk about easy work! (Just don't throw any parties.)

 You can find an appliance timer in most hardware stores in the lighting section. Refrigerator thermometers are pretty easy to find. You can get them at pretty much any grocery store.;
, Plug your mini-fridge's power cord into the appliance timer. Then plug the appliance timer into the outlet.
 Allow it to run, and take the temperature. Once it is below 55 degrees F (proper wine storage temp) then move on to the next step.
 Basically, the appliance timer can be set to intervals which will turn on and off power to the mini-fridge. This will effectively raise the temperature enough to make it a good place to store wine. Start with 2 hours on, 2 hours off intervals. If you start with this, and the temperature ends up above 56 degrees F, adjust the timer so that it has longer on settings, like 2 1/2 hours on, 1 and 1/2 hours off. Likewise, if the temperature reads too low, adjust your timer so that it has longer off settings, 1 1/2 hours on and 2 1/2 hours off.

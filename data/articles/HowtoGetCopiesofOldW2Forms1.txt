If you have not received your W-2 by this date, or if you have lost or misplaced it, you can contact your employer.;
, If your employer contracts out payroll duties, ask your boss for the phone number of the company that handles your companyâ€™s payroll. You can call this provider and request to have your W-2 mailed to you. Be prepared to provide your Social Security number or employee number.


Make sure to specify the year of the W-2 form that you want to have sent to you.
Make sure the provider has your correct address on file.
While you are speaking to the payroll provider, you may also want to ask how long it will take for your W-2 to arrive.

 The can should have a shiny surface to reflect light and heat away. Metal is the best material to use for this particular experiment. Fill the can about 2/3 full, leaving enough space to add ice cubes.
 Add the cubes gradually, stirring the ice water mixture with a thermometer as you do so. This will keep the can surface the same temperature as the water.


Continue adding ice, a few cubes at a time. Stir after each addition until the cubes have melted. Keep adding ice until you see water condense on the outside of the can.
 This is the dew point temperature. The dew point is the temperature at which water completely saturates the air and water vapor condenses.The can and water are a simplified form of a chilled mirror hygrometer, a device with electronic sensors which meteorologists use to measure dew point. The higher the dew point temperature, the more someone will feel the moisture in the air.

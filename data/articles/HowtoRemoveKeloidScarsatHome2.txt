 If none of the natural methods help to reduce your keloid scar tissue, then the next step is to consult your doctor for a professional medical solution.
 The most common solution for small and newer keloid scars is an injection of corticosteroids (intralesional triamcinolone acetonide), which reduce the synthesis of the keloid tissue.Your individual scar may react different to the treatment, but the average process requires three to four injections over the course of a month., Your doctor may suggest cryotherapy (freezing of the tissue) in conjunction with the injections. Cryotherapy damages the keloid tissue and helps lead to necrosis (death) of the keloid tissue to break it down faster than the corticosteroid injections alone.You can expect three to six sessions of cryotherapy for an average keloid scar.A cryoneedle is a recent innovation to this technique that your doctor may suggest. This specialized needle allows your doctor to inject liquid nitrogen into the tissue as opposed to simply applying it to the top of the tissue. This can quicken the process., Another option that is commonly used in association with corticosteroid injections is 5-FU, which is a drug that inhibits fibroblast cells (important cells in the process of healing wounded tissue) in such a way as to reduce keloids., Laser therapy options are becoming increasingly common in the treatment of keloid scars. The laser is used to break down the capillaries that feed the keloid tissue and to alter the production of collagen in the area around the tissue.Anywhere from two to six laser therapy treatments can vastly improve the color, height, and texture of a keloid scar., Depending on the height and area of the keloid, your doctor may also suggest excision (cutting away) of the tissue. This is usually only proposed for keloids more than one year old since the tissue can often flatten by itself over this time period. Excision of the keloid would result in a fresh wound that requires specific care to help avoid the potential for another keloid developing.Always follow the exact care instructions provided by your surgeon to help heal any wound with the best achievable results.

 This can be done with a thermometer. You can also look the temperature up on a computer or smartphone. You will need to know the current ground temperature to estimate temperatures high in the sky., This is the temperature where water droplets begin to form (rain or dew) at a given pressure and humidity. Knowing the dew point at ground level will allow you to estimate the dew point at higher levels. It is easiest to look this up on a computer or smartphone, but you can Measure Dew Point point using some simple tools., Atmospheric temperature and dew point temperature both decrease at a steady rate as you go up. This means that you can predict what they each will be at some distance from the ground using the current temperature and dew point at ground level. Make a chart with three columns. The first will be height, the second will be temperature and the third will be dew point.Fill in the height column starting with “Ground Level” and then each subsequent value will be an increase of 100 meters (330 ft) (100 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, etc.).
For the temperature column, the first value is your current temperature (in degrees Celsius) and for each 100 meters (330 ft) in altitude that you increase, subtract one degree (20 degrees C, 19 degrees C, etc.).
The current dew point at ground level will be your first value in the dew point column. The subsequent values are found by subtracting 0.2 °C (32.4 °F) for every 100 meters (330 ft) in altitude (15 degrees C, 14.8 degrees C, 14.6 degrees C, etc.)., When the air temperature and dew point coincide, you will form water droplets. When this happens in the atmosphere, those water droplets form clouds. The clouds you are observing will be at the altitude where your graph’s dew point and temperature values are the same.

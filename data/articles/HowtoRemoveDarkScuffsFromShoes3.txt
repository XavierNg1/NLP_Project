 Now that your shoes are free of scuffs, there are steps to take to prevent any more. Buy some protective spray from a local shoe store or online shop. Make sure that it’s the correct type of spray for the material of your shoes. Spray it over the whole surface of the shoe, following the instructions. Sprays like this help prevent further scuffs and abrasions and help keep your shoes looking new and fresh.
 If you used a method other than polish to remove your scuffs, you’ll want to add some shoe polish. Choose the correct color for your leather, then rub the polish on with a clean, lint-free cloth. Rub the polish on evenly across the whole surface., Shoe scuffs are inevitable, but you can help protect nice shoes by only wearing them in clean, orderly environments. You’ll be less likely to scuff a pair of nice, leather shoes if you only wear them to work, not to a concert or sporting event. Keep a pair of older shoes handy and wear them when you know they might get dirty.

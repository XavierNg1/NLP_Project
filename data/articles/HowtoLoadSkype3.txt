 Some computers and tablets that run Windows 8.1 come with Skype preinstalled.


You can check by going to the Start screen, the screen with all the colored tiles, and clicking or tapping the Store tile, which has a shopping bag with the Windows logo on it. If you don't see the Start screen, press or tap the Start button until it appears.
Type "Skype" into the search box.
Click the Skype tile. If Skype is installed, you'll see a message that reads "This app is installed on this PC." Click "Update" to see if you're running the latest version.
 Follow the steps to install Skype for modern Windows on your device.

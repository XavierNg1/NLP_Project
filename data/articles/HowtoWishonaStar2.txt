 You probably won’t see a lot of shooting stars in one night, so you have to be discerning in what you wish for. Think of things that you’ve always wanted: a million dollars, a house, a jumbo sized vanilla shake. It could be anything! Let your imagination run wild.
 If you’re having trouble deciding between wishes, write down a list of all of them and then choose a few through a process of elimination.


Some believe that writing down your wishes on a post-it note helps it come true. Creative visualization helps you to better understand your wishes and goals., This is a manifestation technique that some think helps wishes to gain potency. If you believe in yourself and your dreams, they are more likely to come true.Instead of saying: “I wish I had a better job,” try phrasing it this way: “I am hardworking and intelligent and capable of getting a better job.” This language is positive, affirmative, and helps give your wish more weight.
 It’s impossible to control or change someone else. Imagine if someone else made a wish and asked for you to fall in love with them, or for you to be more beautiful or successful. These are elements that only you can control.You can wish for things on other people’s behalf. For example, you can say, “I wish that Todd gets his second interview this next week.”
It’s not useful to say something like: “I wish Todd had a nicer smile and also didn’t like watching football so much.”

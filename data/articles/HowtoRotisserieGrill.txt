When using a charcoal grill, build your charcoal to either one side of the grill or around the outer edge of the grill. Because of the extensive roasting time, you will have to add more charcoal during cooking.
When using a gas grill, lower all the burners. The drip pan will shield the heat from being directly under the meat.;
, Put 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) of water into the drip pan. This will help baste the meat as it rotates.


For extra flavoring, put herbs, spices, juice, beer or wine into the drip pan with the water.
 Reduce the temperature of the grill to medium low for the rest of the cooking.



Tenderloins and boneless roasts should be rolled into a cylinder shape for even cooking.
Tie the wings and legs of chicken and turkey to keep them in place while rotisserie grilling.
 Skewer the meat with the prongs and rod of the spit. Repeat with the other set of prongs to the other side of the meat. Secure the prongs to the spit. Tighten the ends to ensure it will not loosen during cooking.


Make sure the meat is balanced for even roasting.

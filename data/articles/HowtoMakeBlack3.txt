 On your palette or painting surface, place a small dab of Ultramarine blue. Blue should make up roughly half of the total paint, so use as much as you need for what you want to paint., Don’t apply the two colors to the exact same spot. Rather, place them a half inch or one centimeter apart. Then gently swirl the two colors together. Adjust with a little more of either color to make the black you want.
 if you want to deepen and darken the black you’ve mixed, add just a small dab of Prussian Blue. This new mixture works great for a black that shows the darkness of night.

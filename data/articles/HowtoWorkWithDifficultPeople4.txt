 Don't get mad or hold a grudge. It's possible your coworker simply has other issues at home that are affecting workplace performance. Perhaps your coworker has some stressful life situation that he or she isn't letting on about.
 Do not be accusatory or mean. Use factual evidence instead of conjecture, and communicate calmly and clearly to your coworker that his or her behavior is affecting others at work., Don't try to get your coworker in trouble, as this could cause hostility or retaliation. Instead, sit down with your coworker and try to help him or her find a more effective strategy to deal with the work that needs to be done.

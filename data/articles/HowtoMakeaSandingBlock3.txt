 You can use a small block of off-cut wood retrieved from the scrap pile, provided it's the right shape. A rectangle is the optimal shape because it's easy to hold and covers a good area when sanding. If needed, cut a piece of ordinary wood into a rectangle of a size suitable to hold in your hand (around 2" x 4").
 Cut a piece of foam to the same size as the block. Glue it to one wide side of the block. When dried, cover in duct tape to keep firmly in place and to provide you with a grip.


Attach the ends of the duct tape to the sides of the wooden block alongside the foam.
 You will need to cut the sandpaper to size.
 Staple on a new piece and start again.

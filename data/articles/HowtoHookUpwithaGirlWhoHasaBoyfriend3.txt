 You could be waiting around for a long time for this relationship to end, if it ever does. Even then, you might have to watch her go through a string of relationships if she moves quickly from one relationship to the next.


Consider her current relationship. If she’s in a strong relationship, she is not likely to leave it, even if she likes you, too.
Though it’s not romantic, scientifically there’s no such thing as “the one.”Do you want to spend your life waiting around for a girl who is interested in another person? There are plenty of other girls looking for someone like you.
 If you care enough to wait for her, disregard Method 2. Don’t manipulate her feelings. Be present in her life and let her know that you are someone she can trust. She may drift in and out of relationships, but she will keep you around.


If you genuinely care about her, nurturing a friendship with her will come naturally. Make small gestures. Remember her birthday and how she likes her coffee. If you notice she's having a rough day, ask her if she wants to talk about it.
 She will know you care for her well-being if you respect her relationship. Don’t try to break it up.


If she is happy in her relationship, she will not thank you for critiquing her boyfriend or finding ways to get their relationship on rocky ground. Even if she is unhappy in the relationship, if she realizes your motive she will see it as manipulative.
If you truly care for for her, you will want her to be happy, even if it's not with you.
 Once she and her boyfriend break up, give her time to grieve that relationship and heal from the hurt. Don’t wait too long, though, or she may move on to another relationship before you get your chance.

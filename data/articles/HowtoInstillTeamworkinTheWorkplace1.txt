 This can be done during the hiring process, at the beginning of a new project or during individual and team evaluations and assessments.


Assign tasks and job duties based on skill, interest and the needs of the team. Your workplace will function better if every team member is aware of his or her part in completing a project or getting work done.;
, There should be daily goals, weekly or monthly goals, quarterly goals and annual goals. Each team member should understand and be able to identify what they are working towards.


Include team members in goal setting and mapping out strategies to meet the goals. Employees will truly feel like a part of the team if they play an active role in charting the course.
 When a new member joins the team, make sure he or she is immediately brought up to speed on policies, procedures, expectations and goals.


Encourage other team members to lead the orientation instead of having managers and supervisors do it. This will encourage responsibility and cooperation from your existing and new team members.

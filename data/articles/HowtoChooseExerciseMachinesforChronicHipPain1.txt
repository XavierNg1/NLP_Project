 Exercise can be beneficial for hip pain, but it is important to do exercises that are low-impact. These exercises are less likely to agitate your hips and lead to more hip pain.


For example, if you are considering getting a stair machine, then it would be important to make sure that the machine has a low-impact setting, such as shorter strides and gentle steps.;
, High resistance is more likely to agitate your hips and intensify pain. Make sure that the machine you choose has an option for low resistance.If the machineâ€™s resistance cannot be adjusted, then it might not be a good option.
 Ensuring that the machine has multiple, stable hand placements is also important.This will help to make it easier to stabilize yourself on the machine, which may make the exercise easier on your hips.


Check the hand placements on the machine to ensure that they are stable.
 Another way to determine if a machine will be good or bad for your hip pain is to check your foot placement. Machines that have poor foot placements will put extra stress on your knees, which may also agitate your hips.To check the foot placements of an exercise machine, step onto the machine and look down at your feet. If you cannot see your toes, then the foot pedals are not well placed.
For stationary bikes, you should be able to adjust the seat ensure a comfortable position.

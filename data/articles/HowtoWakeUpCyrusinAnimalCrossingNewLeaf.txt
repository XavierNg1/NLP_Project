 One of the quickest ways to sell 100,000 bells worth of items to Reese is by selling her identified fossils. Another great way is by catching a lot of the bugs on the island at nighttime, bringing them back, and selling them.


You can sell almost anything to Reese over at Re-Tail. In order to do so, enter Re-Tail and talk to Reese by pressing “A.”
Choose the option “I want to sell!” then select the items that you wish to sell by tapping on them.
Hit “Confirm” located in the lower right-hand side of the window, and Reese will then tell you how much she’s willing to pay; to complete the sale choose “deal!”;
, The catalog in Animal Crossing: A New Leaf keeps track of how many items you have obtained at one point or another in the game.


This prerequisite does NOT require that you have 100 items of furniture on your person at one time, merely that you have obtained 100 unique pieces of furniture at some point throughout the game. Therefore, if you got a kiddie couch from a villager as a reward and immediately sold it, it would be required in your catalog and count towards this goal.
 This works the same way as the step above. You need to have come across 50 unique kinds of clothing throughout the game in order to fulfill this requirement.
 You will likely fulfill this requirement while attempting to fill the others, but just in case you zoom through the above steps, make sure it has been seven days since you started your Animal Crossing game.
 Once you have fulfilled all of the above requirements, just visit Re-Tail again, and this time you will be informed that Cyrus has woken up and is available to work for you.

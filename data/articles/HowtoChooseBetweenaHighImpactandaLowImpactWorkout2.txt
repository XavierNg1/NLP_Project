 You should already be used to low-impact workouts of moderate intensity and be in good health. Pick shoes with good arch supports, cushioning and traction.


Jogging and running are popular, versatile workouts because they can be done outside or inside, on a treadmill. You will also meet weight loss goals more quickly through running than walking because the intensity of the workout is greater.
Start jogging or running short distances and increase your pace and your mileage slowly to avoid common injuries, such as shin splints, or medial tibial stress syndrome, and sore toes, heels and arches of the feet.
 Team sports can be excellent confidence boosters for children, teens and adults. They are a great way to enjoy a jovial, game atmosphere while you get your weekly exercise.


Make sure to wear all the protective gear that is recommended for your specific sport.
 You can contact a personal trainer or find workouts online that rotate jogging and sprinting. They help to develop your body both aerobically and anaerobically, increasing both speed and endurance.
 These camps are done for 1 to 4 hours at a time, and they include running, jumping, strength training and isometrics.
 For example, you should often alternate the days you do a high-impact workout, a low-impact workout and strength-training. This will give your body a chance to rest, and allow you to maintain your shape without injury.


Too much high-impact exercise is unhealthy for the joints. Many trainers recommend that you allow your body to rest a few days out of the week. You may choose to alternate with walking, swimming or no-impact exercise, or avoid exercise altogether 1 to 2 days out of the week.

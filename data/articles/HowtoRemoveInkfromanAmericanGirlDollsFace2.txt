 You do not need much to clean your doll’s face. In a cup or bowl, add one teaspoon of baking soda. Then, add a few droplets of lukewarm water until you’ve formed a paste.This won’t take much, so don’t put the cup or bowl under running water. You can stir the small mixture with a small spoon, some sort of stirring rod, or a toothbrush you can use to apply the paste.
 Using a clean toothbrush, cotton swab, or small towel, gently start working the paste into the stained area.Depending on the type of ink on the doll’s face, you should see the stain start lightening immediately. If the stain is particularly dark or large, this might take a few applications of paste.


Tie their hair out of the way before you apply paste to their face.
Be careful not to get water in your doll’s eyes, which can cause rusting.
 Take a damp rag or cotton swab and remove the paste from your doll’s face. Evaluate the results. You may need to create more paste and try again. If the stain is particularly stubborn, you may need to try cleaning the stain with a benzoyl peroxide cream.

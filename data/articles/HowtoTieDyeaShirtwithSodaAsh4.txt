 When applying the dye, you want to add enough so you don't see white. At the same time, you don't want so much dye that there are little puddles of it on top of the shirt. There are several ways you can apply dye:


If using the spiral pattern, apply one dye in the center and move outwards, encircling each new ring with a different color.






If using the spiral pattern, apply different dyes in each quadrant created by the overlapping rubber bands.
If using sun pattern, apply different dyes in each segment created by the rubber bands.
If you wish to have your whole shirt tie-dyed, stain both the back and front with the same dye pattern. If you wish to only have one side of your shirt tie-dyed, stain only the front or the back side.
 The dye will still be on your shirt.
 Make sure the dye has washed out and the water dripping from the shirt is fairly clear. Remove the rubber bands to see what it looks like.
 Do not wash with any other shirts, or the shirts may stain when the dye runs out during the washing process.

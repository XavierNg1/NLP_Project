 Where you gather the moss is important. The kind that grows on trees won't necessarily do well on walls.


Gather moss from pavement, damp bricks, cement walkway, etc. Moss from the woods doesn't work as well and should be left in the wild. If there is no moss on the walks and walls where you live, the moss milk probably won't work in that climate.;
,, Break into manageable pieces. Then place the pieces in the blender.
 Blend the mixture until completely smooth. You'll want it to have a paint-like texture.


If the mixture is at a consistency where you feel it will drip, add corn syrup until the consistency you desire is reached.






Alternatively, use one cup of ordinary milk to 1 to 2 tablespoons of moss.
 Whizz around but do not liquefy it because the moss cells must stay intact.
,, Depending on your climate, sometimes it takes a while to grow your moss.

 The island can be found three map squares southeast from the center of the map. It’s a ring island covered in ice with a dragon-like stone figure at its center. Enter the inside of the island through the stone figure’s mouth.;
, Once inside, take the ice path on the right-hand side all the way around to the other end of the room, where you’ll find the chest containing the Iron Boots.


Be extra careful when making your way through the ice path as it’s very slippery.
 Press the Start button on your Nintendo GameCube controller to open your item inventory and equip the Iron Boots by selecting it.
 On the left side of the treasure chest you’ve just opened, a strong gust of wind is blowing. Using your Iron Boots, walk a few feet against this strong wind and you’ll find a hole in the ground. Drop inside this hole to find a bunch of frozen enemies.
 Open your item inventory once more and use the Fire Arrow to melt the frozen knight. After melting, the knight will become active and will start attacking you.
 Keep striking the enemy knight with your sword to knock off his armor. Once all the armor pieces have been stripped off, keep on striking him with your sword until the enemy is defeated. The enemy will drop the Knights Crest once it’s been defeated.
 Claim the Knight's Crest and exit the hole by walking through the ray of light you see in the area. Leave the hole without unfreezing or killing any other enemy beside the knight, or else the trick won’t work.
 Drop inside the hole once more and the same knight will be there again. Unfreeze the knight and defeat it again to get another Knight's Crest. Repeat the steps until you’ve achieved your desired number of Knight's Crest.

 The process will go a lot faster and smoother if you grab everything you need before you get started. Clear the table to get the process rolling. Have the following items handy:


Plastic bag ("dry cleaners" bag or 5-gallon trash bag)
Paper clips (used for weight)
Small pieces of paper or stickers (decorations)
String
Scissors
Hair dryer

, It's best to use small pieces of paper or stickers--anything that's lightweight. Glitter is okay, too, though a bit messy.


This part is great for kids. Each child can make their own hot air balloon and design it to uniquely represent them.
 It should resemble the bottom of a standard balloon. Once knotted well and tied, cut off any extra string.
 This may seem counter-intuitive (you need less weight to fly, right?), but it's good for balance and stability.


Don't go overboard. 6 or so per balloon (again, evenly spaced) is a solid number.
 Blast the dryer on high and give it a minute to warm up and fill completely with air.


The bag will start to become buoyant. When it begins tugging, release the bag. The hot air inside the balloon is lighter, causing it to float.
Give the balloon another blast as it begins to fall.

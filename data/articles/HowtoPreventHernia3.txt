, Hernias require surgical repair in order to get better, so make sure that you discuss your options with your doctor. During hernia surgery, your doctor will re-position tissues that have moved out of place, remove damaged tissues, and repair the abdominal wall with a synthetic mesh.If your doctor decides surgery is necessary, continue to focus on the lifestyle changes mentioned as it also improves the success rate of the surgery.
 Your doctor may advise you to wear a truss, which is a girdle that helps to keep your hernia in place before surgical correction. Make sure that you do not wear a truss in place of treatment. A truss is a temporary protective measure and it will not repair a hernia.

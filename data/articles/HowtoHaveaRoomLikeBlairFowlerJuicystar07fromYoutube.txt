 This is a very important first step, because you may find things you never knew you had. You can also get rid of clutter and old junk, which will help your room to stay neat and tidy like Blair's!;
, Choose two colors - one a little more neutral, and one bright one. Blair's color theme is hot pink and rainbow, which are both bright. If you enjoy a lot of bright color, go for it. If you prefer to be more subtle, go with the recommendation; one light/neutral color, and one bright one. Such as a light blue and hot pink or baby pink and neon green... the possibilities are endless. Also be sure you have your furniture color theme picked out. Blair's furniture is all antique-looking wood, but you can pick anything, from white, to chrome... etc.
 Will you need to repaint anything? This could include furniture, walls, lamps, etc. Do you need more lighting? Put that down on your list. Do you need a place to store jewelry, makeup, books, school stuff and the likes? Or perhaps just a new bedspread? Good places to go for bedroom furniture and accessories are Pier 1 Imports, Target, occasionally Walmart and IKEA. Also whatever local stores you have.
 Find out the general price range of the stuff you will need to get and make a list. Be sure to stick to your budget. Try to get the total amount by rounding a bit. If you find specific things you want, make a note of what store you found them in next to the item it is on your list.
 Try to get an adult or a mature friend (immature friend + paint = you trying to get rid of them) to help you, unless of course you won't need much help.
 Your jewelry and makeup should be organized. Make your bed!! This can get annoying, but have Blair's room tour video (linked below) playing to inspire you.
 Every time you take something out, put it away as soon as you're done! Pretend that a big news company is coming to show your room the world any random day, and that you need to keep it tidy for when they finally come.

 Talk to friends and family members who have already been through a divorce about their experiences with their attorneys.Most people who have gone through a divorce won’t shy away from relating their stories, and some may even be willing to openly discuss the consultation fee they paid as well as their divorce attorney’s hourly rate.


Ask specific questions about your friends’ experiences communicating with the attorney. Helpful questions that you should ask include:

Does the referred attorney promptly answer emails and phone calls?
Is the attorney’s staff friendly, knowledgeable and easily accessible?
How was the attorney in court – did he or she seem comfortable communicating with the other attorneys and the judge?
Were all terms clearly spelled out and all questions answered prior to the attorney requiring a retainer?
Would your friend select this same attorney if they were in the same situation again?
Were your friends’ cases settled in the agreed-upon timeframe or did the attorney tended to drag things out?



, In this digital age, most attorneys have at least a website or social media profile. Use a search engine like Google to locate both general and specialized divorce lawyers operating within your community.
 Bar associations such as the American Bar Association (ABA) are a great resource for attorney referrals based on your location and the type of attorney that you require. You can find your bar association’s website by selecting your state from the State & Local Bar Associations page provided by the American Bar Association. Some state bar associations also have certification programs for experienced family law attorneys that have to meet specific experience requirements, pass a written exam and be recommended by their peers. These are typically very experienced and qualified. Many state bar associations will allow you to search for these attorneys.

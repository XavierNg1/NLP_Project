 To remove dog urine from the carpet, start by adding water and a few drops of dish soap to a thick cluster of paper towels. Place over the area of the carpet that your dog urinated on. Using your foot or a gloved hand, press down the mess lightly to absorb as much as possible., Mix one cup of white vinegar and one cup of water. Add a tablespoon of baking soda, stir and pour the mixture into a spray bottle. Spray a thick layer of the mixture onto the soiled area of the carpet and let it sit for 5-6 minutes.You can also opt for a store-bought carpet cleaning spray, but avoid products containing chlorine, ammonia and sodium lauryl sulfate, which can be harmful to pets.
 With a fresh cloth, gently blot the area to absorb the solution. Let the carpet air dry. Keep pets away from the damp carpet while it dries., If the area is still stained, or if it still smells like urine after your first attempt to clean it, consider renting a carpet cleaner. Cleaners are usually available at local hardware stores or grocery stores for rental periods of 24 hours or more. Opt for a hot water extraction cleaner, the rates for which start at $20 a day for less expensive models.Be sure to follow directions carefully when using a rented carpet cleaner.

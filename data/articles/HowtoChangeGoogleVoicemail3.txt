 Visit the Google Voice website, and enter your Google email and address in the given text fields. Click the blue “Sign in” button to proceed to your Google Voice account.


Note that if you are already logged into any of Google products, like Gmail or YouTube, Google will not ask you to log in again. This is because Google has made it possible for users to use one account across all of their products.
 Click the gear icon at the top right corner of the Google Voice page. Once you click the icon, a drop-down menu appears. From the options of this menu, select “Settings” to access the Settings page.
 This will direct you to a screen showing your groups. Below each group name is an “Edit” button.
 Go to the group you would like to set the greeting for, and click on its “Edit” button. This will take you to the screen for choosing the voicemail. Under the “When people in this group goes to Voicemail” section, you can choose a pre-recorded voicemail or you can record a new voicemail greeting.
 To choose a pre-recorded voice mail, click the drop-down menu under “When people in this group goes to Voicemail” section to see a list of greetings you have recorded. Scroll through the list, and click on the one you want to use. Complete the process by clicking the “Save” button at the bottom of the page.


To record a new greeting, click the “Record new voicemail” button. Google Voice will then call you on the forwarding phone. It will take a few seconds before your phone rings. Pick up the call, and record your voicemail greeting when prompted. Google Voice will then automatically save and set the recording for that group once the call is terminated.

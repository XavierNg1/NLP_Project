 Not all people will need a disposable incontinence product to begin with, if they only tend to leak a little bit. A few drops of wetness is normal to expect in any given adult.;
, All that you might even need might be a feminine pad that can double as a wetness "catcher" when you don't need all that much. And females aren't the only people who can afford to use them, males can to, as long as they tailor it to their own "urine catching area" near the front "zone" of their underpants.
 Most often times, you'll find those that are pads, those that are pull-up styled, along with those you put on much like that of a baby-like disposable diaper (those with tabs and such).
 This can further help determine just what's available to the wearer.
 Most stores might carry a large selection of types, along with a wide variety of brands, but since stores vary in what they carry, call the store first.
 They can be useful in these two situations.
 While most diapers are pull-up styled (with or without extra-protection/better-fit tapes), most can get away with wearing these during the day. And most of these brands can be fit to either gender (unless the outside of the package describes otherwise). Depends has come out with gender-based incontinence products that look and work much like those specifically for that gender, so be careful when noticing/purchasing these products.
 Most companies provide baby-like (tape-diapered styled) disposable incontinence diapers that get put on. These diapers are mostly marketed as "for Maximum Protection" and most can be worn at night without much need to be changed during the night.

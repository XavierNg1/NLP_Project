 This is the same as dividing the perimeter by 4. Since there are four sides to a square and each side is of equal length, you can find the length of a square just by dividing the perimeter by 4. Let's say the perimeter of the square you're working with is 20 centimeter (7.9 in). Just multiply 20 centimeter (7.9 in) by 1/4: 20 centimeter (7.9 in) x 1/4 = 5 centimeter (2.0 in). You know that the length of a side of the square is 5 centimeter (2.0 in).
 Square the length of the side. Now that you know that the length of a side is 5 centimeter (2.0 in), you can square it to get the area of the square. Area = (5 cm)2 = 25 centimeter (9.8 in).2

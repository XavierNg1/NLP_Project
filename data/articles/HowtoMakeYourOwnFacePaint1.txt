 Face paints are made out of two parts: the base and the color. First, we'll make a neutral base that we can add any color that we wish to. Stir until smooth.


Note that, in the UK, cornstarch is typically called "cornflour" — the ingredients are identical.
Ideally, you'll want to use a white lotion so that it won't affect the color of the face paint. If you don't have lotion, you can get away with using any mild skin cream, like cold cream, shea butter, and so on.;
, The recipe above should work well on its own in most cases. However, if you don't like your results, you can add more cornstarch to make the mixture thicker and more lotion or water to make it thinner — it's up to you!

, Once you have your base just the way you like it, use a clean spoon to transfer it to its own small container. Ideally, this container will be one that you have multiple of — as you make more colors, you can keep them together in their separate containers for convenience.

One cheap and creative way to store face paint is to use an egg carton. Put a little base in each compartment individually, leaving them about halfway full to prevent spillage when you mix in the colors.
Another good choice for this is to use leftover baby food containers — they're usually just the right size to hold face paint.
 Put a few drops of your preferred food coloring in your neutral base. Stir thoroughly to combine until the color is smooth and even. You may need to add a little more food coloring than you first think is necessary — keep in mind that this paint will be spread fairly thin when it is worn.

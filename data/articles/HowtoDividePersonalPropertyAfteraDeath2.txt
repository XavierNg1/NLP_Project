 If a will does not exist, the deceased person’s personal property may be divided and distributed by the courts through the probate process.


The way in which personal property is handled in probate in each state varies greatly, therefore, the best way in which to begin probate proceedings is to seek the advice of an attorney.
A number of states have adopted some form of the Uniform Probate Code (UPC), which will dictate intestate succession, or the order in which family members will be entitled to property in the absence of a will. For instance, under the UPC, all property will be left to a surviving spouse first if the deceased person’s surviving children were the children of the decedent and the surviving spouse or if there are no descendants or parents of the deceased person. If there are descendants born out of a different marriage, or parents of the deceased, or if there is no surviving spouse, the UPC will dictate the specific division of power. , Since a will does not name an executor in this case, it is necessary to ask the court to appoint you as executor of the deceased’s estate so you can direct the estate through the courts. If not, you should find someone else to serve as the executor in order to start the probate process. , The way in which each specific probate court handles proceedings vary but a local, experienced attorney or the local court clerk’s office can give more specific information on the proper procedure. In general, the person appointed as executor must:


file a request for probate;
publish notice of the probate proceedings in a local publication such as a local paper;
mail notice of the proceedings to any related parties or possible beneficiaries of property;
file proof of notice being sent and that you published the proceedings locally with the probate court; and
file other local required forms with the probate court.

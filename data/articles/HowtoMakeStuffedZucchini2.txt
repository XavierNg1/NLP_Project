 To get your zucchinis ready for grilling, you've got to wash them, and then slice them in half, lengthwise. Mondo zucchinis are perfect for this recipe, but any kind of zucchini will do. Simply boil a pot of water, add some salt to it, and cook the cleaned zucchinis in it for about 10 minutes. This should get them a bit tender and will make it easier to scoop out their insides.
 Dice up the white onion, cook and dice the ham, and dice the tomatoes and mushrooms as well. After you cook and dice the ham, make sure to remove the extra grease, or to keep it to use for the stuffing mixture.
 Remove the zucchini from the pot and let out the excess water. Then, place them on a cutting board and wait for them to cool. This should take a few minutes.
 Use a small spoon to scoop out the flesh of the zucchinis. It should be pulpy and filled with seeds. After the boiling, it should come out pretty easily.
 Now, sauté the diced white onion, add the tomatoes, and simmer the ingredients for a minute or two. Then, add the diced mushrooms and continue to sauté until they are soft.
 Now, place the onion, ham, diced tomatoes, and mushrooms in a bowl. Then, add the egg, fresh bread crumbs (you can even make these with day-old bread), and the Parmesan cheese. Stir the ingredients thoroughly until they reach a nice and creamy texture.
 Alternately, you can use a grill pizza pan instead.
 Place the zucchini halves on a plate, with the skin side down. Then, spoon the stuffing into the zucchini, taking care to scoop about the same amount into each half.
 Medium heat means about 350-400ºF (176ºC-204ºC). Keep watching it to make sure the zucchini doesn't get burned. It should be crispy on top, but it should not turn black. When it's soft and ready, take it off the grill and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
 Enjoy this tasty grilled stuffed zucchini on its own whenever you want. For an extra creamy and rich taste, sprinkle a bit more cheese on top and serve.

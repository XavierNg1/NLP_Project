 Throw yourself into the things you enjoy doing to keep your mind off your crush. If you used to spend a lot of time thinking about the object of your affections, reclaim that time by putting it towards a new project, a good book, or a series on Netflix that you’ve been meaning to watch.If you previously dropped some of your hobbies because you were distracted by your crush, picking them up again is a great way to move on.;
, Instead of pining over someone who isn’t interested in you, mix it up with some new people who will appreciate how great you are. You don’t have to go looking for another crush just yet, but don’t be shy about reaching out to all kinds of people and making new friends.School, extracurricular activities, community clubs, and volunteer work are all good ways to meet people.
 Expand your horizons and take your mind off the past by challenging yourself. If you’ve always wanted to do something but never worked up the nerve, there’s no better time than right now to give it a try.For example, you could audition for a play, take a solo trip, or apply for a new job.

 This procedure has been shown to protect against animals that will eat the bark of the tree, and also protects against boring insects that would otherwise work their way into the trees’ trunks.Paint trees at least annually in the early spring before insects are active.
Painting fruit- and nut-bearing trees can also prevent the bark from splitting;
, This mixture is most effective when combined at a 1:1 ratio. You can simply combine 1 gallon (3.79 liters) of water with 1 gallon (3.79 liters) of paint to achieve the proper consistency.


White paint is more likely to reflect sunlight and, thereby, reduce heat damage.Latex paint contains polymer binders to fill and hold splits and cracks.
 This tool will be most effective and help you reach all the cracks in the bark of the tree. Dip your paintbrush into the water/paint mixture until the bristles are about halfway submerged, then withdraw the brush and apply directly to the tree trunk.


Paint up to the first line of branches. Rodents such as mice, voles, and rabbits will not be able to reach higher than this on the tree, so there’s no need to paint the upper portions of your trees.
 This will ensure maximum coverage of the tree trunk, and will allow the paint to seep into gaps or cracks in the bark.


Allow excess paint to drip down the trunk as you go. You don’t need to wipe up or clean dripping paint.
Use an airless paint sprayer if speed and convenience are a priority, but make sure paint still reaches into cracks and splits in the bark.
 In instances where boring insects are persistent or not discouraged by the 1:1 mixture of latex paint and water, you may need to apply the paint at a thicker consistency.Start with a 3:1 mixture of paint to water. If this still doesn’t deter boring insects, you may need to apply the latex paint directly to the tree trunk.

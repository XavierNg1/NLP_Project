 Your Facebook "About Us" page should have it, as should your Twitter bio.


Remind users of that website link. Do not leave your website buried in the biography and About Us page only. Provide your website link on any of your own posts, blogs and comments.
 Give a brief description or a bit of information, and then say "for more information, visit our website at:" This will give your followers and friends an incentive for visiting your site.
 Your website should have information on the product or service you are selling, while your social networking sites should have constantly refreshed and updated information. People do not want to see the same content in both places.
 For example, publicize a contest on your Facebook page, and direct them to your site. Offer a coupon on Twitter, and send them to your web page.
 This will allow users to go back and forth between your website and your social media site.
 A Share button can allow users to easily share information from your website onto their social networking pages. Making it easy for users to share your website with their own followers will increase your page views.


Try a solution such as AddThis (www.addthis.com) or ShareThis (www.sharethis.com) for the simplest and most efficient sharing technology on your site.
 Google Analytics can tell you how many people are coming to your website from social networking sites. This information can help you understand how many page views are a result of your social networking.


Set up Event Tracking on the Google Analytics page. There is a step-by-step guide on the Google Analytics page that will help you manage tracking if you do not have an I.T. expert on hand.
 Many different platforms such as SpoutSocial (www.sproutsocial.com) can help you analyze and understand social media reporting information and how it relates to your page views.

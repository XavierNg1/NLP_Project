 Take time to clear your home of all broken, unused or non-essential items. If you can clear 30 percent of the items on display on desks, tables and other places in your eye line, you can remove unnecessary stimulation.
 Spend 5 to 30 minutes each morning focusing on gentle, pleasant thoughts, instead of breaking right into a list of things you must do. This will get easier as you develop a habit of giving yourself a few moments of respite and calm before becoming active in mind and body.
 Comfort foods are often followed by a feeling of guilt. Avoid that negative feeling by choosing a relaxing, distracting activity that changes the focus by releasing tension from your body.

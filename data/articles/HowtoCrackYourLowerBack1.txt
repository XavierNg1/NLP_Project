The area where you lie should have a flat, firm construction. Yoga mats or towels can provide padding if needed.;
, Your left leg should remain extended and flat in its initial position.









When your right leg is bent, your right foot should be close to but not touching your buttocks.
 Your right knee will cross over your left leg. If possible, twist until your right knee comes in contact with the floor on the outside of your left leg.









If you reach a point of pain, stop the stretch, and return to the original position. Do not stretch past the point of comfort.
Maintain the positioning of your right foot, but as you continue the twisting motion, the sole may lift from the floor.
 While often effective, your back may or may not crack during the space of this method. Regardless the stretch should feel painless and comfortable at all times.
 Bring your knee back, pointing up towards the ceiling before extending your right knee into its starting position.
 Though you may hear or feel your back crack after only stretching to one side, you may find it possible to crack different vertebrae of your spine by repeating the process on the opposite side.

 You'll need to find out the specifics of their SRO policy. (Some shows don't sell standing room tickets at all.) The following are general steps for buying SRO tickets.
 Relax! It's easy, and it involves no math, that's a promise. Go to broadway.com and scroll down to the "Popular Show" list on their homepage. If the show you want to see isn't in (or very close to) the top 15 on this list, don't bet on getting SRO tickets. These tickets are only available for performances that are already sold out, and any show that isn't very, very popular is unlikely to do so. If the show you want to see isn't high up on the list, try one of the other methods first. If you're told that no tickets are left, you've then got the opportunity to ask about SRO.
 Some shows don't begin selling SRO tickets until very close to curtain time, but you'll still want to ask early in the day how close the show is to selling out. Box office staff will be able to tell you the likelihood of SRO tickets going on sale that day based on how many seats remain to be filled. If you're told that the show is unlikely to sell out, ask about rush or lottery tickets or try for SRO tickets to another show.

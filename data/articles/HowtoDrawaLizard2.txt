 You'll want to have pictures of real lizards to look at, so that you can make yours look as real as possible!

, Begin by drawing a rounded tear-drop shaped head, as well as another rounded tear-drop shaped for the body. The points should be pointing outward in opposite directions, with a small gap between them.
 Attach the two shaped with a neck guide. And erase your whole lizard so that you can see all of the lines that you drew when your first started

, Now that the shapes are all drawn in, you can begin sketching out the shape of the actual face and head structure. Notice that this animal has a strong under-bite. Draw the jaw line in a well defined manner, and then add some of the back neckline.
 Now you will draw the eye. Start with a bold arched line for the lid, and then draw the eyeball. Add a nose hole, and then some definition around the head and neck.
 Up next, draw the front part of the neck, and then draw the front legs which are very squishy looking. Draw in the feet and toes .
 Draw the other leg and notice how the leg is pointing toward the other leg. The legs of a lizard are bow shaped.
 Continue to work on the body by drawing the belly. Then add the back lines which then turn into the tail.
 Clean up your drawing by erasing the guidelines and shapes that you drew in Step 1.
 You can color your drawing if you want to.

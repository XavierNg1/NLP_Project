 To avoid removing the lid entirely, you can poke a hole in the lid of the drink and pour the liquid directly into your mouth without touching the lid.


To poke a hole in the lid, use a sharp tool (like a knife or fork) and apply pressure to the top of the lid. Be extremely careful when doing this, it is easy to slip and accidentally cut yourself. Do this on a solid surface and always cut away from yourself.
 A squeeze bottle can more easily be controlled if pouring the liquid directly into a mouth without touching the rim. The liquid can be more easily controlled to make for a neater drinking experience.


A squeeze bottle may be more efficient than using bottle with a lid with a hole poked in it.
 Hold the bottle above your mouth, about 6 inches away from your lips. Squeeze lightly if the liquid does not fall due to gravity. Be careful not to touch the bottle to your lips or mouth to avoid spreading germs. Do not squeeze too hard or you might spill your drink!

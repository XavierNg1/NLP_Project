 Crumble and cook the sausage in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.


Stir the sausage as it browns to prevent it from burning.
Do not drain the sausage once brown.
 Evenly sprinkle these dry ingredients over the sausage and stir. Cook for another 2 to 4 minutes.


Make sure to coat the sausage evenly with the dry ingredients.
Stir the contents of the skillet constantly to prevent the flour or sausage from burning.
The flour should be browned before you proceed to the next step. Browning the flour is important. If you skip this step, your gravy will taste like raw flour.
 Pour the milk into skillet in once batch.


Stir the milk into the meat mixture to incorporate it thoroughly.
 Drop the heat to medium and let the gravy reach a low simmer. Allow it to continue cooking until it reaches your desired level of thickness.


For a thin gravy, remove it from the heat as soon as it begins to thicken. For a relatively thick gravy, allow it to simmer for 10 minutes or so on low heat.
 Pour generously over your traditional biscuits and serve while still hot.

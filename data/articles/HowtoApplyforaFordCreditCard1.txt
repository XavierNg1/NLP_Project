 Sometimes, you're not sure if you're ready for credit or not. You want to apply, but don't want the embarrassment or the ding on your credit if you are turned down. Ford Credit lets you take your credit for an anonymous test drive so you can get a feel for things before you put your money down.;
, In the top right, there's a button that says "Apply for Credit." Click that.


From the resulting popup menu, click on Credit Test Run.
 You can choose from any of Ford's model offerings, or continue without selecting a vehicle.
 You can plug in real numbers, or hypothetical numbers, such as how much you want to pay each month, what your trade in is worth, your credit worthiness, salary, bills, etc.


When you're ready to find out the best way to proceed, plug in real numbers for the most accurate results. Based on the information you enter, Ford Credit will calculate your best approach to acquiring financing.

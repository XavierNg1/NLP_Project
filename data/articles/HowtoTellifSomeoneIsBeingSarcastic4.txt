 The use of a nasal tone may indicate sarcasm.


When English speakers express sarcasm with the word "Thanks!", they often use a nasal tone.
Some researchers say that this nasal tone shows a connection between sarcasm and extreme disgust., Sometimes words are drawn out for effect when the speaker is trying to convey sarcasm.Example: "Well, excuuuuuse me!"
Example: "You're sooooo welcome."

, A speaker will often place stress on certain adjectives in order to convey sarcasm.


For example, if you hear someone say "Aunt Prunella sent me this gorgeous pink and green paisley tie," the stress on the word 'gorgeous' would usually indicate sarcasm.
The stressed word may also be communicated at a lower pitch than the other words in the sentence for added emphasis.
 This is when speakers create a unique sarcastic effect by totally eliminating all vocal expression.Such flattening is usually complimented by a monotone pitch and a generally bland delivery.
This is particularly effective with words that normally express excitement, such as "Wow." or "Yay."

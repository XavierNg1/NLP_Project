 Sometimes severe weather forces people to stay indoors for days at a time. Make sure you have enough water, non-perishable food, medication, personal hygiene items, and batteries to last at least seven days. Store extra flashlights, tools, and cell phone chargers nearby that are only for emergencies. If possible, include extra cash just in case you have to evacuate. You may not be able to reach an ATM.Buy a hand-crank radio to use if the power goes out. The radio will be an invaluable source of information if you need to evacuate.
Stock one gallon of water per person per day.
 High winds can break windows and doors, hurling glass and wood debris through the air. Shuttering the windows and locking the doors helps protect them from the wind and airborne debris outside.If you don’t have any shutters on your windows, close them as best you can and cover them with blinds, shades, or curtains.
If your door doesn’t lock push a heavy piece of furniture in front of it to keep it closed.
 Don’t leave during the storm to search for people. If you need to reach someone, use your cell phone. If you use a landline you risk being electrocuted.If you’re worried about debris falling on your head, cover yourself with a thick blanket or hide under a mattress.


Don’t touch electrical outlets or appliances that are plugged in.
Keep away from any windows or doors.

 When you crack your knuckle or back or neck, your joint capsule stretches, forcing a release of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.This forms a bubble of air, which then collapses on itself. This is what causes the audible pop we associate with cracking a joint.
 Although there are several other health risks associated with cracking your joints, and your neck specifically, arthritis is not one of them. Donald L. Unger cracked the joints of one hand for 30 years without ever cracking the joints of his other hand, casting doubts on the claim that joint cracking leads to arthritis., If you repeatedly need to crack your neck to deliver relief to your neck, shoulders, and spinal area, there's probably a deeper issue that deserves medical attention. Separating the joints in the manner described above does provide temporary relief, but it's just that â€” temporary.


People often find that to deliver the same amount of relief to the neck area, they have to crack the area more and more often. Cracking tends to stretch out the ligaments in the surrounding area, making them less stable. Ligaments that are less stable are less likely to support the weight of your head adequately, leading to more pain.
 A lot of people will mistake the cracking sound for an actual adjustment. This is not necessarily the case (often, it's not the case). To get an adjustment, visit a licensed physical therapist or chiropractor.
 It's better to be safe than sorry. Cracking your neck can result in a whole host of medical problems.

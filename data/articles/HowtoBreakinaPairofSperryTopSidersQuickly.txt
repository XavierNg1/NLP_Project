 Be absolutely sure, because after you apply the aging processes, no retailer will take them back.;
, They should sit flat inside the container without protruding above the rim. A large Tupperware or similar box is ideal, or you can use a roasting tin or plastic tray. You are going to fill it with water, so make sure it doesn't have any holes in it.
, The quantity of salt you will need depends largely upon the size of your container and the volume of water therein. Roughly speaking, for each liter of water, you will need 35g (approximately 1 tablespoon) of sea salt. This will give you a salinity of 3.5%, which approximates the average salinity of ocean water. Do not worry about being too precise. If in doubt, add more salt rather than less, and taste it. It should be repulsive, like a mouthful of New England brine. Not tasty at all.
 If they float, use a weight to keep them submerged. You can turn the shoes upside down, too, which ensures the whole of the leather upper is submerged.
, Wear them around for a while until they begin to dry; this will not take as long as you might imagine, and the leather becomes quite comfortable and warm. You may not even realise you have wet shoes on.
 Your shoes will begin to conform to your feet, and the shiny new gloss will be considerably subdued. The leather will take on a tasty patina, as if you have been sailing for two weeks.

 Do not be cheap when buying med packs, ammo, and power nodes. If you are trying to get the "One Gun" achievement/trophy make sure that it is fully upgraded and fill your inventory with ammo and medium medical packs.;
, Before charging out into the middle of the dock, use kinesis to get the boxes. When you are ready, head towards the ship. A sequence will start, showing the Hive Mind and his tentacles.
 Remember what those did to exploders and drag tentacles? If you aren't using the plasma cutter, I highly suggest using a maxed out pulse rifle. Until you can get a clear shot, evade it's tentacles by strafing left and right. When it comes in to howl, Open fire on one of it's yellow bulbs. If you can, try spreading the damage out on all of the bulbs without destroying them. Believe me, it helps later on.
 No you have to aim and fire with your aiming inverted. This is when spreading the damage around comes in handy.
 The Hive Mind may now start shooting Pregnants after you. Be careful! The Hive Minds tentacles will destroy the Pregnants causing them to deploy.
 Now sit back and watch the final cut scene.

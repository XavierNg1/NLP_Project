 For this problem the assumptions are as follows:


The total amount of carbon monoxide gas is a closed system (the carbon monoxide gas cannot leave or enter the system)
The gas is modeled as an ideal gas with constant cv. (This was assumed because the problem stated that the ideal gas model can be used and cv can only be used in an ideal situation)
The gas initially in each tank is in equilibrium. The final state is an equilibrium state too. (This is assumed because the problem wants us to analyze the final equilibrium state)
No energy is transferred to, or from the gas by work. (This assumption is that energy is conserved because there are no external forces doing work on the system)
There is no change in kinetic or potential energy. (Assumption based on conservation of energy due to the assumption above)

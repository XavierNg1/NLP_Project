 No one ever communicated well silently. This is because, despite our often wistful desires, we are not mind readers. If you want to meet someone or talk to them, speak up.;
, Disarming someone with a smile tends to encourage them into thinking, hopefully rightly, that you are a friendly person who just loves conversation.
 Hello, my name is _____. I couldn't help but admire your ______. Is that real silk / gold / pearls / cotton, an accent from _______, etc?

, People love to talk about things. After they get over their initial shyness, people will open up and carry on the conversation willingly.
 People are inherently vain creatures. Even the prettiest among us fear aging or being told they are no longer pretty. Conversely, the less attractive the person, the more responsive he/she will be to your compliments. There is always the chance that they've convinced themselves that they are practical when they deny it as an untruth. It can also happen the truly attractive people can be told they are ugly enough to believe it, so it may take some convincing for some that you are in earnest.
 There is one unspoken rule in the world. You can make small talk with nearly anyone. Here are a few common topics:


Completely normal greeting: "What are you doing...?"
Weather: "Nice weather we're having." "Do you think it might rain?" "I wish it would rain."
Little Girls/Boys: "That's such a cute dress" "Oh, I like your tie." "Wow, are those new shoes?" "Your hair looks so cute like that."
Pets: "Oh, can I pet your dog?" "What a funny cat, where'd you get him/her?" "What kind of horse is that?"
Gardens/Flower Arrangements: "Do you have a/like to garden?" "I planted some tulips this winter and they never came up in the spring." "I love roses. These came from _______ (Name of store)."
Food: "Ooh, that looks good, where'd you get it?" "Is that cucumbers? Where did you get them?" "That smells delicious, what is it?"
Accents: While this one can get a little more in depth, if someone has a really strong accent, its acceptable to ask where they are from or what their ancestry is, but tread carefully. Word things respectfully.

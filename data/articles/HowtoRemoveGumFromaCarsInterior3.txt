 If there are bits of gum you aren’t able to remove using another method, try pulling a strip of duct tape off the roll that is large enough to wrap around your hand.Duct tape’s adhesive can help get small bits of gum out of carpet or upholstery that other methods may not reach.
This method is best when used after another method to remove the majority of the gum.
 With the adhesive side of the duct tape facing outward, wrap the tape around your four outstretched fingers so you can use them to press the sticky side of the duct tape into the bits of gum on the carpet or upholstery.Stick the tape to itself after you’ve wrapped it around your hand.
Rotate the tape as you go so you will always have a fresh, sticky surface to try to stick to the gum.
 Press a portion of the tape down into the upholstery or carpet with your index, middle and ring finger firmly. Once the tape is pressed down onto the gummy area, rub the back of the duct tape with your fingers to ensure the adhesive has come into contact with as much of it as possible.You may need to do this multiple times if there are bits of gum scattered about from previous attempts to remove it.
 Yank the tape straight backward, allowing the adhesive to remove the gum from the carpet. There will likely be fuzz and lint stuck to the tape from the upholstery or carpet, so turn the tape on your hand and repeat the process until you are able to remove all of the bits of gum.Replace the piece of tape if need be.
Larger pieces of gum may not come off using this method.

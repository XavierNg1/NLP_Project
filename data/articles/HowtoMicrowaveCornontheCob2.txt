 Pull the entire depth of leaves and corn under them off at once, as if peeling a banana rather than an onion. They will stay together for neat disposal. Pick off the individual strands of silk that remain stuck to the corn. Another way to shuck the corn is by cutting the harder end of the corn which makes the husk come away automatically.









Do not dispose of the husk and silk in a garbage disposal, since they are so fibrous. Throw them in the trash or compost them.
A fun craft for children or the young at heart are creating corn husk dolls.

Either Leave the stem on for a handle, or tear it off with the husk.
 You may cover the corn with a wet paper towel or put it in a dish with a microwave safe lid. You can also use a clean tea or kitchen towel.

At this stage you can add flavors or toppings that will cook right into the corn. Try shredded cheese, lemon or lime juice, or any number of spices.
You can soak the paper towel with liquid flavorings like lemon or lime juice to gently enhance the flavor of the corn without making a mess.
 Arrange the ears in a single layer with space between the cobs for even cooking. Microwave the corn on high for up to five minutes, depending on how many ears you're cooking. Each ear requires two to four minutes of cooking time, with more time added if you're microwaving several ears of corn.

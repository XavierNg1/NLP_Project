 Bleached hair is particularly vulnerable to UV light, and it can even lead to sunburns on your scalp if you aren't prepared. If you plan on being outside for more than an hour, bring a hat along.
 After swimming, you should try to rinse your hair at least. Since bleached hair is more vulnerable to damage, you need to be wary of keeping any chemicals in your hair for too long.
 Your hairs are already brittle, and adding heat is only going to make things worse. That means no:


Irons
Hair-dryers
Straighteners

, Avoid excessive combing or styling that pulls, bends, and breaks hairs. Let your hair fall where it may, from time to time, and give it a chance to recover. Avoid breaking it or pulling it out when it is weak.

 Madrid has two well known art museums, including the Prado, with the famous painting, Las Meninas by Velaquez, and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, with another famous painting, Guernica by Picasso.;
, If spending the day viewing paintings doesn't interest you, there are many other museums in and around Madrid. There are history museums, science museums, even museums on bullfighting. Almost any museum genre you can think of can be found in Madrid.
 You don't need to visit just museums in the city to have a meaningful time. Attend a bullfight, go to flamenco, or just spend a few hours walking around the city and you'll get an enjoyable experience.
 For a country that eats dinner at nine to ten at night, there must be a nightlife. In Madrid, you don't have to go to a club; you could simply spend the night outdoors, roaming the busy streets.
 Madrid (and Spain in general) has a rich culinary history, with foods like suckling pig, tapas, and marzipan. Madrid even has the oldest continuous restaurant in the world. You'll be able to find this, along with contemporary foods, all over Madrid.
 Madrid itself has plenty to offer, but you can take day trips out of Madrid. Two popular locations are Segovia, famous for its Roman aqueducts, and Toledo, famous for its religious history. If you're a first-time visitor or have little knowledge of the outside areas, consider hiring a tour guide.

This keeps more moisturizer on the problem areas and less on your real skin, making your skin more even in the long run.Don't use face moisturizers with sunscreen mixed in. Sunscreen can increase acne aggression. So use moisturizers with natural and vitamin rich ingredients. Cetaphil is a great product to use, unscented would be best.

 You are done. Please read the 'tips' and 'warnings' sections for safety reasons!

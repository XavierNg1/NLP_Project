 Instead of creating a single loop, as you would with a standard magic ring, you will need to create two loops. The tail should be in the back on the right side, while the working yarn should be in the front towards your palm.Note that this is very similar to the standard magic ring, but many prefer the double ring for projects that will see a little more action since a double magic ring provides greater durability.
You should wrap the loop around the first two fingers on your non-dominant hand.
 Slide your crochet hook under the two loops of your double ring closest to your fingertips. Grab onto the working end of the yarn and pull it back through to the right, creating a loop on the hook.









Even though you will be creating a double ring, you only need to create a single loop on the crochet hook. The "double" portion mainly results from the double loop you made at the beginning of the process. Much of the remaining steps are similar to those you would use for a standard magic ring.
 Grab onto the working end of the yarn and draw it through the loop currently on your hook, creating a single chain stitch.









You will usually need one starting chain for a single stitch pattern, two for a half double pattern, two or three for a double pattern, and four for a triple pattern.
, Make as many stitches as required for the first round, according to your pattern's instructions.










You may not be able to get both rings to close. That's okay; only one needs to close.

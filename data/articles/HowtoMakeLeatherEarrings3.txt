 Take a piece of cardboard and draw a feather shape on it. You can print a template online if you don't want to draw your own feather shape. Carefully cut out the shape you drew.Do not worry about adding feathered edges. You will cut feathers into the actual leather. Keep the sides of your shape smooth.
 On the backside of your chosen leather, use a fabric pen to trace your shape twice. Slowly cut around the shape you drew. You should be left with two feather-shaped pieces of leather in roughly the same size., Take a small sharp pair of scissors. Use it to make tiny cuts about half a centimeter into your shapes running down either side of the feathers. This should provide fringed sides on either earring, giving your earrings the pattern of feathers., Feathers usually have a light line running down the center. You can use thread and a needle to create this line on your earrings. Choose a color thread slightly similar to the color of your leather, but a little darker so it stands out.Use you needle and thread to weave between the front and back of the fabric, stitching a small dotted line running down the center of each earring.
When you reach the end of your feather, tie a knot with the thread to secure the thread in place. Then, cut away any excess thread.
 If you want to add a small gold tip to your feather earrings, you can do so. However, this step is optional. Dip a paint brush in gold acrylic paint and gently dab the paint on tips of your feather earrings.Once you've added the gold paint, you will have to gently separate the fringes on the edges of your earrings to prevent them from sticking together.
 Punch a small hole in the tips of each feather earring. Then, use pliers or your fingers to open to the hoops on the ends of two earring hooks. Fit the hooks through each hole.Use pliers or your fingers to close each hook tightly. Make sure the hooks are fully closed so your earrings won't fall off later.

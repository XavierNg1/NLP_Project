 Sticking to your religious teachings may be more difficult in middle and high school as peer pressure increases, but you can influence your other friends and classmates who are acting immorally.;
, Suppose that your friends are going to a party to drink. You think to yourself that you will just stay with the people who aren't drinking and still go and enjoy the party. That is really not something you want to try. You might arrive at the party to find all of your closest friends drinking, and you might think about having a little. Consider whether you want to be in a situation like that.
 You can pray or have a conversation with God. What would s/he advise you to do in this situation? Sometimes, it will be best to skip the activity altogether. Other times, you will be able to retain your values even when others may be acting immorally. You will have to judge for yourself.
 Remember that a true friend will respect your decisions. Ask yourself whether what they're trying to force you to do will permanently compromise your morality. Sometimes, you'll be better off without your friends as bad influences. Other times, keeping the love and support your friends give will be worth it, even if you sometimes have to say "no" or disagree with them. Respect their beliefs, and if they are true friends, they will respect yours. Meditate on the matter and decide whether your confused friends will help or hurt you in the long run.
 Some people do not understand the word "no." Surround yourself with people who respect you and your beliefs and decisions.



Try wearing something like a bracelet or a special ring or necklace.
Try using 7 and/or 3 7s for "God" and "The Trinity" to be mindful of God's blessing and for faith -- but not for luck (not for magic).

 In order to find the title of the book, you’ll need to open your inventory and choose to examine the book.


Anthology 1 is Romeo and Juliet
Anthology 2 is King Lear
Anthology 3 is Macbeth
Anthology 4 is Hamlet
Anthology 5 is Othello

,


This stanza mentions “The first words at thy left hand.”
This is an instruction for solving the puzzle; meaning you’ll need to arrange the books from left to right.
 The first stanza mentions “false lunacy” and “incomprehensible words,” which is a reference to the plot of Hamlet.
 The second stanza is the easiest to decipher “playing at death” and “nameless lover” refers to the last part of Romeo and Juliet.
 This stanza is a reference to Othello, referring to the innocence of Desdemona and the lies of Iago.
 This stanza refers to the story of King Lear, where his daughter Cordelia refuses to speak about how much she loves her father as opposed to the false flattery of her sisters.



And with all 5 books on the bookshelf you would have the correct code.
 41523 is not the pass code; on the sixth stanza, you will be instructed to more.


“41523—One vengeful man spilled blood for two” (Hamlet). This means you will have to double Hamlet, which is Anthology 4. Now our code is 81523.
“81523—Two youths shed tears for 3”; this refers to Romeo and Juliet, so you must replace 1 with 3. Our code now is 83523.
Finally, “3 witches disappear” (reference to Macbeth), which is Anthology 3. You’ll have to remove it from the code. The final pass code is 8352.



The puzzle in hard mode does not randomize; the code will always be 8352 on any Silent Hill 3 game.

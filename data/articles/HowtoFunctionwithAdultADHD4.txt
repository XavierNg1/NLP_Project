 Stimulants such as Adderall and Vyvanse can help regulate the neurotransmitters (chemicals in your brain) in the part of the brain affected by ADHD (the prefrontal cortex). Regulating these chemicals can lead to a considerable reduction in symptoms for some ADHD patients. The downside is that you will often have to try several medications and dosage strengths to find the right treatment for you.You should avoid other stimulants, such as caffeine, as they tend to make symptoms worse.
 Reuptake is the process by which neurotransmitters are drawn back into your brain cells. By slowing this process down, you can allow your brain to regulate the “happiness” sensation that is gained by these chemicals being released. Reuptake inhibitors generally take longer to start working than stimulants, but some people prefer them. Like stimulants, you will need a prescription for this treatment., Things like caffeine and sugar can wreak havoc on your ADHD brain. It is best to aim for a diet that is low in sugar and carbohydrates and higher in proteins and omega-3 fats. Basing meals around lean meat and fish along with fresh fruits and vegetables is a great way to start., A regular workout routine will give you a break from trying to “contain” yourself as well as boost endorphins. Choose a sport or routine that you enjoy. If your workout is a chore then you will likely skip it.

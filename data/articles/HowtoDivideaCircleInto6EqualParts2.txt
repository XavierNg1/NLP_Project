 The first step to dividing the circle is cutting it directly in half. Choose a point anywhere along the circle and draw a line through the center of the circle to the opposite end. The circle is now divided into two equal pieces.


This method works well if you are trying to cut a pie or a cake.
 Next, you want to draw two lines that cut the half into thirds. You can approximate this by dividing one half of the cake into three equal pieces.


Get as close to three equal pieces as possible. Again, this method is just an approximation.
 Continue both of those lines through the center of the circle to the opposite side of the circle. If done correctly, the circle should now be divided into six approximately equal parts.


This method is not exact, but is an easy way to divide the circle into six equal parts by eye.

 Pasta that has already been mixed together with sauce will still keep just fine. Pour the sauced pasta into a Tupperware container or large Ziploc bag and seal it up. Make sure there’s as little air in the container as possible before closing it, as contamination will speed up the growth of mold.Let hot pasta cool to just above room temperature before transferring it to a separate storage container.Storing the pasta and sauce together can greatly simplify your storage situation if you don’t have a lot of space to work with.
 Make room for the pasta on one of the upper shelves. The cool conditions will keep it fresh for a few days. Remember not to bury your leftovers behind other items, or your could forget about them until they go bad.


It may help to label your leftover pasta with the item name and refrigeration date.
 In most causes, sauced pasta will keep for up to 3 days, but it will be better if consumed within a day or two. The longer the pasta sits, the more it will absorb the flavor of sauce. Eventually, this can make the pasta mushy and overpower its more subtle notes.If you’re not sure whether you’ll be reheating the refrigerated pasta within this time frame, you may be better off freezing it instead.
Pasta can actually be even better leftover, after the individual flavors have had more of a chance to mingle., A microwave can heat leftover pasta unevenly and deaden its flavor. For better results, scrape the refrigerated pasta into a baking dish and place it in the oven for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees F (176 degrees C). Make sure the pasta is heated throughout, then remove it from the oven and let it cool before enjoying.Covering the baking dish with aluminum foil will help lock in moisture as the pasta cooks so that it doesn’t come out too dry.
You could also reheat sauced pasta on the cooktop over low heat, stirring frequently.

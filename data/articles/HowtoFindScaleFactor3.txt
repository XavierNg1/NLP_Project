Create a ratio comparing the two heights. Scaling up, the ratio is Scale Factor=546{\displaystyle {\text{Scale Factor}}={\frac {54}{6}}}. Scaling down, the ratio is Scale Factor=654{\displaystyle {\text{Scale Factor}}={\frac {6}{54}}}.

Simplify the ratio. The ratio 546{\displaystyle {\frac {54}{6}}} simplifies to 91=9{\displaystyle {\frac {9}{1}}=9}. The ratio 654{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{54}}} simplifies to 19{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{9}}}. So the two rectangles have a scale factor of 9{\displaystyle 9} or 19{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{9}}}.
 An irregular polygon is 14 cm long at its widest point. A similar irregular polygon is 8 inches at its widest point. What is the scale factor?

Irregular figures can be similar if all of their sides are in proportion. Thus, you can calculate a scale factor using any dimension you are given.Since you know the width of each polygon, you can set up a ratio comparing them. Scaling up, the ratio is Scale Factor=148{\displaystyle {\text{Scale Factor}}={\frac {14}{8}}}. Scaling down, the ratio is Scale Factor=814{\displaystyle {\text{Scale Factor}}={\frac {8}{14}}}.

Simplify the ratio. The ratio 148{\displaystyle {\frac {14}{8}}} simplifies to 74=134=1.75{\displaystyle {\frac {7}{4}}=1{\frac {3}{4}}=1.75}. The ratio 814{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{14}}} simplifies to 47{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{7}}}. So the two irregular polygons have a scale factor of 1.75{\displaystyle 1.75} or 47{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{7}}}.
 Rectangle ABCD is 8cm x 3cm. Rectangle EFGH is a larger, similar rectangle. Using a scale factor of 2.5, what is the area of Rectangle EFGH?

Multiply the height of Rectangle ABCD by the scale factor. This will give you the height of Rectangle EFGH: 3×2.5=7.5{\displaystyle 3\times 2.5=7.5}.

Multiply the width of Rectangle ABCD by the scale factor. This will give you the width of Rectangle EFGH: 8×2.5=20{\displaystyle 8\times 2.5=20}.

Multiply the height and width of Rectangle EFGH to find the area: 7.5×20=150{\displaystyle 7.5\times 20=150}. So, the area of Rectangle EFGH is 150 square centimeters.

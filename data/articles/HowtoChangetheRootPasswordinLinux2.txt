 The Grub menu appears right after you turn on the computer. In most cases, it only stays on the screen for a few moments.


If you don’t press E before the Grub menu disappears, reboot and try again.
There are many distributions of Linux, some more obscure than others. If you’re not able to get to single-user mode with this method, check your distribution’s website for instructions specific to your system.
 This is the line you’ll need to modify in order to boot into single-user mode.


In CentOS and some other distributions, the line may begin with “linux16” instead of just “linux.”

, The line ends with ro, so place the cursor right after that.
 The end of the line should now look like this: ro init=/bin/bash.


Note the space between ro and init=/bin/bash.
 This will tell the system to boot directly to a root-level command prompt.
 This mounts the file system in read-write mode.
 Since booting into single-user mode gives you root access, there’s no need to pass additional parameters to the “passwd” command.
 Note that you won’t see the characters you type on the screen. This is normal.
 When the system confirms you’ve re-entered the same password, you’ll see a message that says “password updated successfully.”

, This command reboots the system normally.

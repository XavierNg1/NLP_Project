 Draw a curved triangle and another smaller one inside of that.;
, On top, just a bit below the tip of the tower, draw a line. Now, almost halfway down the triangle draw a horizontal line and again halfway from that, draw another line.
 This forms the arch at the base of the Eiffel Tower.
, The sizes of the X's vary depending on where you will be putting them in the drawing. Start with the larger ones at the base of the tower and decrease their size as you progress to the top.


Draw in vertical lines through the Xs as shown to create the impression of the steel structure.
Add in the base blocks of the Eiffel Tower as shown.
 Erase the guidelines.
 Although optional, this step completes the look. You are done!

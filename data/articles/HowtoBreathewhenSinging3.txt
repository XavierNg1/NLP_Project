 To start, lie on the floor with both hands on your stomach. Inhale deeply, and let the breath puff out your stomach so that your hands rise above your chest. Then, exhale gradually. Let your deflating belly carry your hands back to the starting position., Take a deep breath, then exhale a thin and steady stream of air. Inhale for 4 counts: 1, 2, 3, 4 . Then, exhale for 4 counts. Gradually push your lung capacity until you can inhale for 6 counts and exhale for 10. Make your inhalations quicker and your hisses longer until you can breathe in for one count, then exhale for 20.Try "hiss singing" for a few minutes in the mornings and the evenings. It's most important that you make this type of breathing into a daily practice.
 In order to sing well, you'll need to override some of the natural rhythms of your breath. It's common to make mistakes when you're trying to focus on breathing and singing at the same time. Catch yourself when you are trying to hold in too much air or trying to exhale it too quickly.

Avoid "tanking up." Many beginning singers try to breathe too deeply, filling up their lungs as much as possible to avoid running out of air. Don't focus on volume â€“ focus on efficiency. Exhale as steadily as possible to preserve your air.Avoid "pushing air." A heightened focus on your breath might cause you to breathe out forcefully. Be sure to let the air out gradually. Take the time to focus on your breath.

 Most likely, other people will share the same pain you are feeling post-tragedy, so it is important to fully listen and empathize with that. Avoid using phrases such as "the world is not that bad" or "there's no reason to be upset, you have it so good compared to a lot of people". These are invalidating phrases. You must help others get through the tough time and allow them to fully process their pain and anger., Most of all, remind them that you would never do anything to intentionally harm them or put them in danger. This reminder will give them a sense of peace., Sometimes violence happens as a result of hatred towards a particular group, such as LGBT people or African-Americans. Find a way to protect yourself and others from this sort of discrimination., There are a lot of positive things to enjoy in life., Perhaps you could try an exercise where you all find at least three joys in your day based on the good in the world. For example, teach them to be mindful and look for beauty, whether it's a beautiful painting, a cute dog, or even a random act of kindness. And, even better, encourage people to be part of the good in the world through being accepting, tolerant and kind!

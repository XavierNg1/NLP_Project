 Most likely, there are other bowlers on your lane who would like to bowl too. Therefore, when it is your turn, be sure you are walking up to the area immediately to avoid keeping everyone waiting.

If you need to use the bathroom, try and time it out so you have a minute before your turn, and go as quick as possible. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can also designate someone to bowl for you if you do not come back in time so that no one is kept waiting.
 While you should be ready to bowl immediately when it is your turn, wait until that short process is complete, because failing to do so could result in you damaging equipment or your ball, and it may also result in your ball getting stuck. , It is dangerous to do so, because it can result in you getting oil on the approach, which can be dangerous for anyone who is walking on it. , Although you will likely be told if you are about to throw your ball down the wrong lane, you may not be. Therefore, it is important that you pay attention to which lane you are on at all times, because if you throw your ball down the wrong lane, the game will likely be delayed because the score will have to be changed., This will immediately open up the approach so that someone else can bowl right away, and it won't unnecessarily delay the game., If it is your turn, and you as well as the person to the right of you are ready to bowl at the same time, let them go first. Step off of the approach and wait patiently for them to finish.

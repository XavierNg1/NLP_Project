 While this may seem like the instructions for writing a ransom note, they’re not! Instead you’re going to use the words you cut out to create a poem.Try to find single words to use, not entire headlines.
You can even cut out parts of a word if that works for you.
Keep the magazine or newspaper from which you cut your words in case you need to go back.
 Now that you have your words cut out, you’ll need a good, large and clear space to work on. A large table, or even the floor, will work well., Once you’ve cleared your workspace, lay out all the words on the surface. Like a puzzle, move the pieces around into different arrangements looking for something that is interesting, fun, unusual, witty, whatever.Read the words out loud to see if they make sense in whatever order you’ve placed them.
Create new words by combining two or more of the cut out words.
Don’t worry about the statements making sense.
Look for good spots to include a line break, or a certain type of punctuation.
 Once you have a pretty good idea of what your poem is going to look like, add a title. If needed, cut out duplicate words from the magazine or newspaper to use in the title., Now it’s time to break out the glue! Use plain pieces of paper and either glue, staples, tape, or whatever you want, to attach the words to the paper. Trim words if necessary to make them fit.If you need a specific word, and the one you cut out is too large, find the same word in smaller font in the magazine or newspaper and use that instead.
Cut out additional punctuation from the magazine or newspaper if you need to.

 Gear ratios are figured using rear gear divided by clutch gear. For example if you were running a 15t clutch gear and a 60t rear gear it would be 60 / 15=4. Simply put this means 1 revolution of the axle to 4 revolutions of the crank.;
, If you run the same gears as someone else but you have 34" rear tire circumference and someone else has 36", the true ratios are not equal. To figure the true ratio you will want to use IPR(inches per revolution) which simply means the number of inches a kart will travel per each revolution of engine.
 For example if one racer(Racer A) was running a 15t clutch gear with a 60t rear gear and their tires were 34" the equation would be 34 x 15 / 60 = 8.5. This means the kart would travel 8.5 inches (21.6Â cm) per revolution of engine. If another racer(Racer B) had the same gears but had 36" tires look what happens. 36 x 15 / 60 = 9.0.
 Racer A would be faster coming off the corners and Racer B would be faster down the straight. So what if Racer B wanted to run the same IPR as Racer A but still use the same tires? To figure that we can replace Racer B's 60 with Racer A's IPR. 36 x 15 / 8.5 = 63.52. This means that for things to be equal, Racer B would need to change their rear gear to a 63t or 64t.
 Think IPR, not gear ratio. Here's a couple of links to use if you need a go kart racing clutch or rear sprockets.

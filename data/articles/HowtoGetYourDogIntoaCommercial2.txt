 Get your dog looking its best by bringing it to the groomer's for a wash, hair dematting, haircut, nail trim, scissoring of feet, and pad shaving. If your dog is not familiar or comfortable with the experience, bring it to the groomer's for a quick visit where it does not receive any actual treatments to get it used to the sounds, tools, and overall environment of the establishment. When you return, be sure to bring treats to reward it for good behaviour., In order for your dog to be ready to star in a commercial, it must be steady around distractions that might be an issue on set. These distractions could include big bright lights, noise, and harried people milling around. Get your dog used to this type of atmosphere by bringing it to equally distracting places when permitted, such as:Dog-friendly cafes or restaurants
Pet stores (like Petsmart or Petco)
Hardware stores (like Home Depot or Lowes)Evening softball or soccer games at a local park

, In preparation for the potential experience of filming a commercial, have your dog meet and interact with new people as much as possible. Socialization may ease its trepidation around strangers, and this comfort will make your dog more composed and comfortable on a commercial shoot. Be sure to assess the comfort level of individuals with your dog before prompting it to be friendly to them.It is your job as your dog's owner to protect it in social situations. If someone gets too close or behaves inappropriately to your dog (e.g. aggressive teasing), correct the human and ask them to back away from your pet. This will show your dog that it's being protected, and doesn't need to protect itself or you by getting aggressive.

 To be productive and efficient, you will need good lighting. Design your space around a window. Daylight makes your workspace more positive, and exposure to sunlight improves the overall quality of your life.Align your workstation facing north or south to avoid shadows at any time of day.
Position yourself adjacent to the window to enjoy the view while preventing glare on your screen.
Get good window treatments that will prevent glare and keep the room from overheating on very sunny days.
 You need other light sources to supplement natural lighting. Light your entire workspace with pleasant overhead or ambient light. Task lights are essential for reading and other close work.A good combination of artificial light sources can compensate if your workspace does not have a window, or at night and on overcast days.
Find task lights with dimmers so they can suit any task.
 You want a productive workspace. Cut down on clutter by only having the items you will need in your space. Make sure you have easy access to everything you need to get your work done.Invest in good desk organizers that you like.
Make sure your desk is proportionate to your workspace. An extra large desk can make you feel cramped.
Incorporate some empty space so you do not feel overwhelmed by clutter in your space.
 Include personal touches that will inspire you without overwhelming your space or distracting you from your work. Use colors that help keep you calm and happy. Balance these with more neutral colors to prevent distraction.


Bring in some artwork or photos that you enjoy and that inspire you.
Make the space cozy with a throw blanket.
Have custom-built shelves that reflect your style.
Decorate with plants.

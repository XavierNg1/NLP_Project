 An impact driver is a manual tool that drives a screwdriver bit further into the screw using a weight and spring. This works well on sturdy construction, but may damage electronics or other sensitive equipment. If you're concerned about damage, avoid cheap models with a stiff spring, since these require forceful hammer blows to work.A powered impact wrench is not recommended, since the excessive force could damage the surrounding material.
 Some models have a switch. On others, you set the direction of the turn by twisting the handle.
 Fit a drill bit of the correct size to the end of your driver. Place it in the screw and hold the driver in place at a 90ยบ angle. Grip the driver at its midpoint, keeping your hand clear of the end.


The bits that came with your impact driver are often extra-hard, which makes the process easier., Tap the end of the driver sharply with a heavy mallet. A rubber mallet helps you avoid scratching the driver.
 Some impact drivers jar out of position after each strike.Set it back to "loosen" if you need to.
 Once the screw comes loose, use a regular screwdriver to remove it from the hole.

 When creating Jello-O based Slime, you will need the following ingredients:


1 Five Gallon Bucket
6 large packages Jell-O
9 Pounds Flour
8 Ounces Johnson’s Baby Shampoo
1 1/2 Gallons Water
Green Food Coloring;
, This recipe makes 3 gallons of gooey green slime. To make the mixing process less messy, combine the ingredients in a 5-gallon bucket.


Open the 6 large Jell-O packages and empty the contents into the bucket.
Pour in 4 ½ pounds flour.
Add 1 gallon of water.
Whisk the mixture thoroughly until all lumps are removed.
 Achieving the ideal slime consistency is tricky. Go slow and check the texture constantly.


Add the remaining 4 ½ pounds flour to the mixture and stir.
Gradually add the remaining ½ gallon of water while continuing to stir. Periodically lift the whisk out of the bucket. Observe how the slime drips from the utensil. If the mixture appears liquid and runny, continue to stir. If the mixture holds together as it slowly runs down the spoon and into the bowl, it is ready.
 Pour 8 ounces of Johnson’s Baby Shampoo into the 5-gallon bucket. Add several drops of green food coloring to the mixture. Stir until the slime turns green.


Add more green food coloring if needed.

, Often, non-commercial stations and college stations start playing artists before the mainstream stations catch onto them.
 Listen to online radio stations, like http://www.accuradio.com or http://www.shoutcast.com . http://www.last.fm is a radio-like service, offering recommendations if you're registered by keeping track of you music taste. If you have an MP3 player, subscribe to music podcasts using iTunes or iPodder.
 These services will recommend new music based on your current tastes.
 Don't be afraid to ask someone what artist/song they are playing when you hear something you like.
 Read their biography (if they have one). Read about particular musical movements you are interested in. This will teach you basic music history, including bands/singers that were popular during certain periods.
 Try to find samples of their stuff online or take it out of the library.
 Don't stick to a single type of music.
 Stores wouldn't put those kiosks out there to feature music that people wouldn't want to buy and bring home. Listen to the featured artists in genres you like. Some stores even let you scan the barcodes of the CDs you want so you can listen to 30-second samples of each song.
 If you have the time/money etc. go and see them.
 Many towns have free concerts in the local park. Arts organizations will often hold free concerts. Check out your local college. Do they have a jazz ensemble or an orchestra? Many times, these students give free performances which act as their final exam. It's free, so you have nothing to lose, and you might even discover something you really love.
 Start it gradually. Even getting one or two CDs per month is great.
 Otherwise, it's just collecting dust. Give it to a thrift store, sell it back to a used record shop or hand it off to a friend who would like it. Perhaps you could trade it to a friend for a CD they have that you might like.

 Clove oil kills bacteria, and will remove some of the bacteria infecting a cavity. Clove oil will also numb the area it’s applied to, as the oil contains the chemical eugenol, which functions as a local anesthetic.Drip the clove oil directly on the aching tooth and gums. Alternately, place several drops on a clean cotton cloth, and apply the cloth to the aching tooth and gums.
Clove oil can be purchased at your local pharmacy or drugstore.
 Combine the powdered ginger and cayenne in a bowl at a 1:1 ratio, add a couple of drops of water, and stir into a paste. Saturate a cotton ball (or a corner of a clean cotton cloth) in the paste, and then apply directly to your aching tooth.This mixture will have a similar effect to the clove oil and will numb the pain from your toothache.


Both powdered ginger and cayenne pepper can be purchased in the spice section of your local grocery store.
Do not use fresh or raw ginger, as the mixture needs to be powdered.
Make sure to apply this mixture directly to the tooth to calm down the nerve pain. If you get cayenne pepper on your gums or tongue, it will cause a burning sensation on the sensitive tissue.
 Salt will cleanse the inside of your mouth and can kill some of the bacteria infecting your tooth, and can also provide temporary numbness and pain relief. Warm a glass of tap water, and add a teaspoon of salt, then stir to dissolve the mixture.Once the salt has dissolved, swish the salt water in your mouth for 30–60 seconds. If the pain is not sufficiently numbed after the first rinse, repeat as often as needed. You may find that cold or warm water works better for you, so use the temperature that works for you.


Make sure to spit the salt water into the sink. Ingesting excessive salt can be unhealthy.

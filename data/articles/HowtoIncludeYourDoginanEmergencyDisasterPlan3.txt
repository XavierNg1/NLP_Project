Make sure the safe room is free of any hazards for your dog, such as chemicals or sharp objects. Store an emergency kit inside the room so that you have access to all of your dogâ€™s supplies., Even if your dog and cat typically get along, an emergency can cause anxiety and your pets may begin to act irrationally.

 This guitar is easy to make, and great for young children. It is your classic tissue box guitar. Here's a list of what you will need:


Tissue box
4 rubber bands
Scissors
Paper towel tube
Tape
Glue
Popsicle sticks, straws, or unsharpened pencil
Paint, paper, stickers, etc (for decorating)

, It should come away easily. If it doesn't, cut it out using a pair of scissors.
 You can also attach the roll using hot glue. The tube should be aligned with the vertical hole in the box.
 You can cover the guitar with paper. You can also paint it using tempera or acrylic paints. Here are some more decorating ideas:


Draw little designs on the guitar using markers, crayons, or glitter glue.
Stick down some stickers or foam shapes onto the guitar to make it more colorful.
Glue down some large beads near the top of the tub to make the knobs. You will need two to three beads on each side.
 Draw a horizontal line of glue above and below the tissue hole. Press a popsicle stick down onto each line of glue. Let the glue dry. The popsicle sticks will lift the rubber bands up a little and make the guitar sound better.


Consider painting or decorating the sticks once the glue dries.
You can also use crayons, pencils, or even straws to make the bridge.
 If you move ahead to the next steps too soon, your guitar will far apart.
 You want to end up with two rubber bands on the left side of the tube, and two rubber bands on the right side of the tube. Position the rubber bands so that they are right over the tissue hole.


Try to use thick and thin rubber bands. Each one will give you a different sound., Experiment with making different sounds. You can even cut a triangle out of a piece of colored cardboard to make the guitar pick.

 If you microwave nuts dry, they will not end up crisp or browned as they do in traditional cooking. Instead, toss the nuts in a small spoonful of oil or butter, roughly ½ tsp per ½ cup (5 mL per 120 mL) or just enough to coat them. This will help the outside cook faster than the inside, recreating that crunch., Microwave no more than ½ cup (120 mL) at a time, to avoid uneven cooking.Keep them in a single layer.
 Cook for one minute, stir, and repeat. Small nuts are usually ready in two to four one-minute sessions, while large nuts may take eight or so.The nuts will turn light brown if you oiled them, but not as much as they would in the oven. For this method, taste tests are a more reliable way to tell when they're done.

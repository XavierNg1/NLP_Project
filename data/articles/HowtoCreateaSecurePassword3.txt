 This software will generally allow you to automatically handle a wide variety of passwords (for applications and websites) by simply entering one "master" passwordâ€”significantly more simple., Specific instructions will vary depending on which program you select, so be sure to follow instructions carefully. Generally speaking, you'll need to visit the appropriate vendor website and click a "download" button before following the installation instructions associated with your operating system.
 Again, the process will vary depending on the specific program. But the basic idea is to set up a complex master password that allows the production and/or maintenance of multiple, site and application-specific passwords to access their destinations. Most popular programs are pretty user-friendly when it comes to core functionality.
 Most of the best password managers will give you the option to either use your master password locally or synced across a variety of devices, so be prepared to determine what works best for you. You can also generally decide whether you wish the program to automatically log you in to sites and whether it audits your distinct passwords to ensure they're sufficiently different and changed on a regular basis.

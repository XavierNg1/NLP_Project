 When you start to read, draw, whatever, you won't vomit all over the place.;
, Add some new songs or movies so you have some new material to listen to or watch. Listening to the songs, reflect on your life and your dreams and passions, etcetera. Daydream to songs. Movies are super cool too. You can also buy some TV shows. I always make a wish list on iTunes for months and save money so by the time you have your road trip you have a ton of stuff in mind.
 You might think it wouldn't be fun, but catching up on sleep would be great, and no one would try to bother you. You'll probably already be at your destination when you wake up.
 Buy some new sketch books and writing utensils so you'll be excited for it! Write a comic maybe.
 Books really pass time! Driving is prime time to catch up on whatever reading. Just make sure that you don't get carsick and puke all over the place.
 To power it, buy an a/c adapter so you can plug normal plugs into the electrical plugs in the car.
 Use the a/c adapter and you can go on for hours. Enjoy yourself. Write a short story, or even start a novel! Write your life story. Beforehand download games, or install games, like the Sims!!! It'll be super fun.
 It makes a difference. The hardest trip to pull off, entertainment wise, is when you depart between 7am-3pm. You will be fully awake and energised, and traffic will make the ride less enjoyable. If you leave at around 7pm or sunset it is fun, because it's like pulling an all nighter. BUT, if you take a Dramamine, you'll be asleep anyway.
 Maybe stop at one quick attraction or landmark. Or keep on going, so you can get there faster. Stretch your legs whenever possible!

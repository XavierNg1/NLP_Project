 If you need a temporary place to stay, rent an RV or buy a used one. Ask friends or family if you can park on their property. If you don’t know anyone, you can park at a local campground for a fee. Recreational vehicles typically have sleeping, dining, and bathroom areas.You can find rentals online or by looking in your telephone book. Shop around for the most competitive price.
 In the U.S., low-income people can apply for a Section 8 voucher. You find a landlord willing to accept the voucher and rent directly from them. The voucher then subsidizes your rent. Contact your nearest Public Housing Authority to apply.There are income limits for eligibility. Typically, your income shouldn’t exceed 50% of the median income of a family your size in the county or city where you want to live. For example, the median income for a single person might be $25,000. Your income will need to be $12,500 or less.
Even if you qualify, there’s usually a long waiting list. You might need temporary shelter.
 Your local YMCA or YWCA might have rooms for rent. Generally, they will charge by the day, week, or month, and you can book online. A night at the YMCA in the Upper West Side costs around $100 a night. This is pricey, but a decent choice if you need a place to crash for a couple days.

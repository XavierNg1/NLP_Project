 This type isn't going to be open to you and admit they like you. These are the kind of people who occasionally make small talk with you. You might even catch them looking at you once in awhile.


Usually these types of people don’t date often. When they do, they tend to hold onto a relationship for awhile.
You can usually tell this type by the way they act around their friends in comparison to being around crushes., These people aren’t being deliberately shy. Some people don’t have as much confidence. You shouldn’t dismiss them because of it. A shy or awkward person might show you they like you when:


They say hey occasionally, but say it quietly where you can hardly understand them.
They might blush when you talk to them or touch them.
You catch them staring at you. If they turn away when they noticed you're looking at them, they were looking at you.
They may ask you for help on things they already know the answer to., Someone who likes you may do something to have you notice them. Watch if they talk louder when you're nearby, or starts laughing with their friends when you’re around.


They may not talk to you on a social website, but they’ll "like" a bunch of things you do online.
 Some people will do almost nothing to show you they like you because they are afraid of rejection and heartbreak.


This happens often with younger people who haven’t realized rejection is part of life.
 Even though this type of person won’t be too obvious, there are still clues to tell they like you. Pay attention for the following signals:


Bumping into you slightly just to be able to touch you.
Taking the seat beside you even though there are other choices. If they're brave, they might even inch closer to you over time.
Being the first to notice when you are sad or upset, since they pay attention to you.

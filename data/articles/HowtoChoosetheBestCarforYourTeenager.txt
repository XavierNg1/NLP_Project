 Ask them, what kind of car do you feel would be the most practical fit for your needs? Try to have them focus on small, compact cars (but not too small). Sure, they may want to start with the fancy convertible or the huge pickup truck, but make it clear to your teen that they should be fairly open minded. This is their first car!;
, Consider the most durable and reliable car brands before your favorites, as these types of vehicles have a wide variety of capabilities so your teen can handle any situation that may arise. Thoroughly read car reviews posted by real drivers (not paid car enthusiasts) to get the most accurate impressions.
 Usually, you'll be able to find a similar model from a different year, which will generally look almost the same and may only be missing a few negligible features. Of course, you can visit any auto dealership if you want your teenager to have a brand-new car, but the best deals are on used cars.
 Some parents prefer that their teenage drivers know how to work both types, but remember, there are good and bad aspects to both. With a manual, you have to take the time to learn how to shift gears, and they have to take their hands off the wheel to shift. Are you going to teach them? Also, it's easy for a new driver to burn out the clutch, and, depending on the car, that could cost you $1,500 or more.
 Make sure to involve not just you and your teenage driver, but the whole family for their collective input. If it helps, write down a list of the pros and cons of each car on your list and go over each one.
 Make your teen happy! Remember, this means that now, they get to pay for the insurance and gas. Your part is done. Oh, and, say goodbye to late night driving them home from parties or friend's houses!

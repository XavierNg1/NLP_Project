 It's a great alternative to starches or flour, when you need to thicken a sauce that is already cold.

Use 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 g) of guar gum per quart (1 L) of sauce or liquid that you want to thicken.
If possible, combine the guar gum with oil before adding it to your sauce. This helps it to stay smooth and not create a gummy textures in the sauce. You can mix a few spoonfuls of oil with your guar gum by hand or in a food processor.
For example, if you're thickening a salad dressing, mix the guar gum with a bit of olive oil, and then stir it into your dressing.
Let the sauce sit to thicken.
 As a rule, guar gum works best for thickening cold sauces. However, if you are thickening a highly acidic cold sauce use xanthan gum instead. Guar gum doesn't thicken as well with acids like citrus.

As with guar gum, use 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 g) of xanthan gum per quart (1 L) of sauce that you want to thicken.
It works best to first mix the xanthan gum with a small amount of oil, but if you don't want to do this, you can whisk the xanthan gum directly into your sauce, and let it sit to thicken.
 Gelatin can be used to thicken cold sauces, but you must first dissolve it in warm water, and then let it cool. Gelatin can also be an alternative to carbohydrate thickeners like flour.

To create a thick sauce with gelatin, use 4.5 teaspoons (22.5 g) of unflavored gelatin for every 1 cup (236 ml) of sauce that you have.
In a bowl, add hot water to your powdered gelatin. Slowly pour in just enough water to dissolve all the gelatin granules.
Then, add your hot water and gelatin mixture to your cold sauce. Allow the sauce to come back to room temperature, and then refrigerate.

 Wood can be found anywhere. If you get a perk called “Keen Eye: Wood” under the Woodworking skill tree, you can spot wood easier in the world because it will glow brightly when you get close.
 These can be found in any major town. If you look at your map, you will see an arrow point with a block in front of it; this is the icon that lets you know there is a Woodworking Station nearby., Once you find the Woodworking Station, walk up to it and press the A button to open the menu., You can find “Refine” at the very top of this list; just hit the A button to open the Refine options., Hit the A button over the wood that you wish to refine. There are varying types, each stronger than the last: Maple, Oak, Beech, Hickory, Yew, Birch, Ash, Mahogany, and Nightwood.

Every time you refine something, you will see your overall Woodworking level increase.

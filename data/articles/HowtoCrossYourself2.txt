 In Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, most people use the three-finger blessing. Your fingers represent the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity, brought together in the Godhead. Tuck the other two fingers into the palm of your hand, representing the Two Natures of Jesus Christ (meaning He is fully human and fully divine).This ancient practice likely dates back to the 400s.
 First bring your hand to your forehead, then down to your solar plexus. Some people place it on their chest instead, as in the Western tradition, but others are concerned that this makes an inverted cross, with a short lower end. (The inverted cross traditionally symbolizes humility, but has been used by anti-Christian groups.)









You can instead bring your hand all the way to touch the ground. This is sometimes used during the Great Fast of Easter, or in times of great trial., Unlike the Latin tradition, the Eastern cross starts at the right shoulder and ends on the left. This is a tradition from many centuries ago, and was once shared by the Western church.
 There are many ways to do this. Here are two examples, separated with slashes to mark where you move your hand:









"Lord / Jesus Christ / Son of God / have mercy on us."“My hope is the Father. / My refuge is the Son. / My protection is the Holy Spirit. / Holy Trinity Glory to Thee.”

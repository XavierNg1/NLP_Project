 Sit in the driver's seat and learn about that particular vehicle. Find all the basic controls, such as the windshield wiper function, the lights, seatbelts, blinker, and pedals.;
, First, slide the seat forward or backward so you can reach all the pedals with the correct feet. Then buckle yourself in, and if the seatbelt is adjustable, make sure it is not too high on your neck. The mirrors should be adjusted every time you enter the vehicle, beginning with the rear-view mirror. Tilt the mirror so you can see clearly out the back windshield, and make sure your night-vision function is off. Both side mirrors should be turned so you can see your car on the inside the mirror, and anything behind or beside you should be on the outside the mirror.
 If you were driving, what would you do? Go over stopping procedure, turning procedure, and shifting if you are in a manual-transmission vehicle. Make sure you're familiar with all the basic controls/levers/switches and their locations.
 Make sure you are driving with a person you can trust and rely on, and kick everyone else out of the car. You do not need to have an audience when you are learning. Leave the radio off - or play classical music quietly. Make sure you're well hydrated and that you've used the restroom before you get into the car.
 Don't treat the vehicle like an enemy - it will get you wherever you want to go, if you know how.

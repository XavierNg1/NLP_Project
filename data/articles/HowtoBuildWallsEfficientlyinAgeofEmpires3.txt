 If a wall is too big, it's not effective anymore because you can't control it when your enemy attacks. So first think about how big it should be. You can minimize the size of your walls if you follow some of the following tips when possible:


Try to use small forests because units can't get through forests. Use the nature it will be much easier for you to send your defending troops to the action when there is not much wall. However, your opponent can knock the forest down with a well aimed cannonball, making this strategy ineffective against experienced real players.
Don't make the wall far away from your village. If the enemy gets through the wall, it will be difficult to defeat him because he can spread his troops and can cause huge trouble to your villagers etc. So really think about which part of your village needs to be defended and build the wall around this area.;
, When you want to send troops really fast to your enemies, you can build a military outpost near them. Build walls around this outpost and make the wall big enough so they have to attack it in order to get to your village. (The enemy could just walk around but nearly all players want to destroy an outpost because it's dangerous for their village).
 The walls shouldn't touch each other. They need to have space between them so you can place troops there. This is a really effective way because if the front wall gets destroyed, your troops can still defeat the enemy army. It can also give you time to send support from your home village. It depends on the situation.
 Do not build a wall that goes back and forward and back and forward etc. If possible, build a straight wall so your troops can reach it easily and you have a good overview on what's going on. This will help you a lot! If you don't know where your wall goes and how it's built, it's too late when the enemy attacks. You need to be quick but it's very effective for the defense.

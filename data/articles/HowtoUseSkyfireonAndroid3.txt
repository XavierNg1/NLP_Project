Another menu will open where you can find “Download”; tap this and you will be taken to a page listing all the downloads you’ve done on Skyfire.
If you want to delete the download history, hold the download you want to remove to make the Delete option appear. When it appears, tap it to remove your selection. Do the same for other downloads you want to remove from the download history.
 If you find a website that you think your friends might enjoy, share it! Once you’re in the website you want to share, open the main menu, and select “Share.” A list of sharing options will be displayed: Share via Whatsapp, Facebook, Yahoo Mail, Skype, and many more.


Select the option you want to use. For example, if you’d like to share through Facebook, tap on the Facebook link. Skyfire will ask for permission to access your account. Give the permission to share the website onto your Facebook wall.

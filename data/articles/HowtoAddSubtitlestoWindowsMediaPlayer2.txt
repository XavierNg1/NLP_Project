 Once the setup file has been downloaded, double click the setup file and let the installation process begin. Once the installation process finishes, Windows Media Player should display the subtitles without a problem.
 If Windows Media Player does not recognize the subtitles even after installing DirectVobSub, you may have to change the format of the subtitle file. Right click on the subtitle file, click on “Rename” and change the “.srt” at the end of the file name to “.sub”.

 When casting agents see your resume (we'll get there later), they want to see a lot of experience. Go to theatre classes, professional actors holding classes, anything that will bump up your resume.;
, This is where you get your start. I have an article how to do good in an acting audition, so check that out if you want to.
 Find a professional photographer that does headshots, and get some made. This is always my favorite part! They will most likely tell you to turn, smile, don't smile, and half smile. They tell you to turn very, very, very much.
 After you get a lot of stuff that is willing to put on there, make one! Film, TV, Theatre.
 They get you many different jobs, and sometimes they're paid! You contact the agent and then go on an interview and do your very best!

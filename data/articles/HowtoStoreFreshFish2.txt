 Before putting fish in the refrigerator, give the cleaned pieces a good rinsing to make sure there are no remaining scales or other detritus. Use the coldest water your faucet will produce. Never rinse a fresh fish in lukewarm or hot water. After rinsing, gently pat the pieces dry with a paper towel or a clean cloth., Once you have the fish all wrapped up, seal the ends tightly so that the meat isn’t exposed to air. Oxygen can contribute to spoilage, especially in fatty fish like salmon or mackerel.You also don’t want any ice to get in the packaging.


Never allow fresh fish meat to directly touch or sit in the ice. Always wrap the fish in something first, to protect it.
If you’ve brought home store-bought fresh fish, keep the meat in its original wrapper., After wrapping the meat, place the bundles back into an ice-filled insulated cooler. Once you’ve nestled the wrapped pieces into the ice, fill a few plastic baggies loosely with more shaved ice and seal them tightly to ensure there will be no leakage.


You want there to be one to two inches of ice in the baggies.
Place these ice baggies on top of the fish.Close the lid of the cooler tightly.
 The bin will catch the run-off. You will need to empty this bin periodically. Make sure the melted water is flowing freely out of the drain plug. Even though the fish is wrapped, you still do not want it sitting in water.The ice baggies need to be replenished daily.Large pieces of fish will store better than small pieces in the refrigerator.
Lean fish (panfish, bass, walleye, flounder, sole, red fish, catfish, cod) will hold up better in the refrigerator than fatty fish (trout, salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, carp, Chilean sea bass).

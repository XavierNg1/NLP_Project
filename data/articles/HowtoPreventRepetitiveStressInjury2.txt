 Correct posture and keyboard techniques can reduce the strain to your muscles. Properly position your body on the chair so you wonâ€™t need to adapt your wrists and hands to the keyboard by bending them in awkward positions.;
, Keep your knees at or close to the same level as your hips with leg muscles relaxed. Rest your upper body comfortably against the back of the chair. In addition, avoid learning too far forward or backward.
 Resting your hands on a wrist pad or on the desk as you type can cause problems. Instead, prepare your hands and wrists for keyboarding by extending them in a straight, comfortable position.

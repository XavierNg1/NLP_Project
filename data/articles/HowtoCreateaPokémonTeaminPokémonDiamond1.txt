 Each will be an elemental type.

Turtwig, the Grass Type: Turtwig has an amazing Attack and Defense and a reasonable Special Attack and Special Defense, but his speed is something to worry about.



 


Chimchar, the Fire Type: Chimchar has spectacular Attack, Special Attack and Speed, and he's a good Pokémon to take strong Pokémon down. However, it's Defense and Special Defense are not very high. This might be a little annoying because a Psychic Pokémon can use a strong psychic attack on it and result in 1-hit K.O. It's evolutions are very powerful.






Piplup, the Water Type: With a high Special Attack and Special Defense, it is an outstanding trooper to use. When it evolves to its last stage, Empoleon, which is a Water-Steel Type Pokémon, it will have a lot of resistance and only three weaknesses.

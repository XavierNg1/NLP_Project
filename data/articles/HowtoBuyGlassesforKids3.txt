 You don’t have to buy expensive eyewear at the optometrist’s office. They are required to give you a prescription, and you can use that prescription to shop around and find a better deal;however, don’t buy eyeglasses for your child without a prescription, and make sure the product you do buy matches their needs precisely.


Be wary of ordering kid’s glasses online, as online purchases are less likely to correctly match your child’s prescription and are typically less impact-resistant, making them less durable., Ask retailers about any warranty plans they have available. Look for plans that allow you to replace glasses for no additional charge or for as little cost as possible. Warranties are especially valuable for younger children and for those wearing glasses for the first time. When looking for a warranty, keep the following in mind:


Check to see how much it costs for replacements with and without a warranty plan. If it costs more to replace one lens than to get the warranty plan, it's worth getting the warranty.
Make sure the warranty covers replacements if lenses get scratched from normal wear and tear. It is common for a scratch coating and non-glare treatments to come with replacement warranties.
 It’s smart to purchase an extra pair for your child, especially if they play a sport or might be likely to play rough. Having a backup is particularly important if your child has a strong prescription and needs to wear glasses at all times. In addition, you might be able to land a discount if you purchase both the pairs together.Consider getting a pair of prescription lens sports goggles that are designated for rough play and activities.
If your child's prescription has not changed significantly, use the previous pair of glasses as a back-up.
You can also ask your child’s eye doctor if you can have an old pair tinted so they can be worn as sunglasses.

 You will need several items, all of which you can find at most health food stores – beeswax, coconut oil, castor oil, jojoba oil, vitamin E oil, vegetable glycerin and beetroot powder. This recipe will yield about 40mL of lip gloss stain, which will fill four 10mL (or 0.33 fluid ounces) tubes or jars.The exact amounts needed are:


3 grams (or 0.1 ounces) beeswax;
6 grams (or 0.2 ounces) coconut oil;
16 grams (or 0.56 ounces) castor oil;
10 grams (or 0.35 ounces) jojoba oil;
1 gram (or 0.03 ounces) vitamin E oil;
4 grams (or 0.14 ounces) vegetable glycerin;
1 tsp beetroot powder.
 Put all of the oils the recipe calls for (coconut, castor, jojoba and vitamin E) into a saucepan and melt them together over low heat. Stir until the mixture looks well-blended.


Remove the saucepan from heat and allow to cool.
Stir the oils occasionally as you proceed with the rest of the recipe., Stir well to combine the two ingredients. Continue stirring until the mixture is a deep red color and the consistency is that of a thick, viscous liquid.
 Stir the oils in the saucepan first to test their readiness. It’s ready to mix once it cools slightly and has a thick, creamy consistency. Whisk the red mixture with your creamy oil mixture until well-blended.


Once mixed, the substance should appear very thick and dark maroon in hue., The final product will be a vibrant, gorgeous red hue. These make wonderful gifts!


Allow the lip gloss stain to cool fully before using.
This product also doubles as a fantastic cheek stain.

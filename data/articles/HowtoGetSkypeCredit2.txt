Bing is a search engine made by Microsoft, and by performing searches while logged in with your account, you will earn rewards points. You can exchange these rewards points for a variety of different rewards, including Skype Credit.
 You'll find it next to your account name at the top of the window.
 The Rewards feature will need to be enabled before you can begin earning reward points.
 Click the Rewards button next to your username to see what reward offers are available for the day.


You can earn 1 point for every two searches you make using Bing, up to 15 points total per day.
You can earn an additional 10 points by searching using the mobile version of Bing. If you don't have a mobile site, you can install a user-agent switching plugin for your browser to trick Bing into thinking your connecting from a mobile device.
You can earn additional points for completing a variety of different promotions and tasks. These change often, so check back daily for different promotions.
 If you do your daily searches using both the desktop and mobile site, you can earn these points in four days. 100 points can be redeemed for 60 minutes of Skype Credit (based on a 2.3 cent/minute rate).


If you have a Gold Rewards account, the cost goes down to 90.
 Scroll down and select the "Skype Credit" option.
 The Skype Credit will be added to your Microsoft account immediately.

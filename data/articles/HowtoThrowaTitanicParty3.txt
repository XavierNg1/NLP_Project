 Consider making an area where guests can sit to watch the movie. Place some extra chairs near the sofa. Lay some large pillow or cushions on the floor if your guests want to spread out. It's always good to have a place for everyone to relax and have fun.
 Choose songs from the period of around 1912, the "Titanic" soundtrack, songs about the sea or sailing, etc. A selection of early 20th-century songs is listed at http://pdmusic.org/1900s.html. Whether you keep the music within a certain era or theme or mix and match is your choice.
 No party is complete without music! Select songs from the early 1910s, music from the movie soundtrack, or nautically-themed songs. It's up to you whether the playlist is strictly one theme or a mixture.
 Have copies of the Morse Code alphabet available for your guests. Write out a message in Morse Code for your guests to decode. This could be a quote from the movie, the name of a famous passenger from the voyage, a headline about the ship or the disaster, etc. Award prizes for the first three people who finish decoding.
 Design new movie- or event-related question cards for your old trivia games. Plan a game of charades in which your guests act out historical figures, movie characters, or Titanic-related issues. You could also get really creative and make your own board game!

 Red snapper fillets should be purchased with the skin on, since it yields a delicious flavor and helps keep the fish together while it cooks. Look for fillets with metallic pink skin and firm flesh. You will need 1/4 to 1/3 pound per serving size.
 This high cooking temperature helps the fillets roast quickly so they have a flaky, moist texture.
 Baking the fillets on top of lemon slices helps them retain moisture. First lightly oil a baking sheet that has a rim. Slice a lemon into thin discs and lay them out on the baking sheet.
 One fillet should fit neatly over two slices, but if you're roasting large fillets, you might need three. Position each fillet skin side down.
 Sprinkle the top of the fillets with salt and pepper. You can also add a little cayenne, garlic powder, thyme, or any other herb to taste.
 Place the baking sheet in the oven once the oven is completely preheated. Bake the snapper fillets for about 15 minutes, or until they are no longer translucent. When they're done, the flesh should be opaque and it should flake easily when poked with a fork.
 Red snapper fillets can be dressed up with a simple butter sauce that brings out the best in their flavor. The sauce is quite easy to make, and it will take the dish up a notch. While the fish is baking, melt together the following ingredients in a saucepan:


2 tablespoons butter
Â¼ teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon chopped rosemary
Salt and pepper to taste
A teaspoon of lemon zest

, Place each fillet on a plate atop two lemon sliced. Pour a little melted butter over each fillet.

 The first person point of view has two different tenses, present tense and past tense. Present tense “I” focuses on the actions and thoughts of the narrator as they unfold in the present. It can be a good option for moving the story forward, carrying the reader through a narrative as events and moments are happening.For example, a first person present tense narrator would be, “I open the window and yell at him to leave me alone. I close the window and try to focus on the latest soap opera on television.”;
, The past tense is a good option if you are writing a story that explores the main character or narrator’s past. It is a more popular tense than present tense and is often easier to do. Writing in the past tense can make the story feel more like it is being told, rather than happening in the present moment.For example, a first person past tense narrator would be, “I opened the window and yelled at him to leave me alone. I closed the window and tried to focus on the latest soap opera on television.”

, In most cases, the first person point of view is not recommended for an academic essay. But your instructor may allow you use the first person when discussing a work of literature or a scholarly work. Use the present tense to give the discussion immediacy and an intimate tone.If you are using APA style, you can use the first person point of view to discuss your research steps in a research paper. For example, you may write, “I studied sample A” or “I interviewed subject B.” In general, you should avoid the first person point of view and only use it sparingly in your research paper.

 Liquid measuring cups are the most accurate way to measure thin liquids, like water, milk, juice, and oils. They are made of transparent glass or plastic, and have markings on the sides to indicate volume in both metric and English units. You can find one at a grocery store, big-box store, kitchen-supply store, or even a dollar store., You won’t get as accurate a measurement if you’re holding the cup in your shaky hands, so set it on a counter or table. Now, pour the liquid in, until it reaches the correct line. Pour slowly, so you don’t have to worry about getting rid of excess.
 Crouch or lean down, so your eyes are level with the measurement line you’ve chosen. You will see a slight concave curve in the surface of the liquid. Make sure that the bottom of this arc, called the meniscus, touches the measurement line., If you’re measuring less than a quarter cup of a thin liquid--for instance, vanilla extract--use a measuring spoon to dole it out. Hold the spoon over a seperate bowl to catch any overflow, and gently pour in the liquid until it’s full. Empty the spoon into the recipe, and continue., It may look intimidating, but this tool will give you hyper-accurate results for small volumes. If you’re doing precision baking, a trip to the drugstore can net you a very useful syringe. Fill it up to the desired volume line according to the package directions, then squirt the liquid into the recipe.

 This is a creative gift that the graduate can keep for years to come. Each college, especially large universities, have a wide variety of T-shirts that can be used to create a unique throw blanket.;
, All college and university bookstores carry all kinds of themed gear and memorabilia, including T-shirts, sweatshirts/hoodies, shorts, gym bags, photo frames, and coffee mugs. Collect a few of these items and gift them to the graduate in a themed bag, if possible. Even though they are leaving campus, they can still show their school pride wherever they go.
 After graduation, many graduates will have to say goodbye to friends they’ve made over the years. But this doesn’t mean they have to forget the memories they made together. Photo collages or albums are a great way to help your graduate transition from familiar faces to a new environment.


Simply collect photos and compile them into a photo album. Since many people don’t print pictures anymore, you might have to search through the graduate’s social media pages to find and print pictures.
Print photos and arrange them in a large frame, or a few large frames, so that the graduate can display their memories in their new home or office.
Get creative with a pillow collage. Many photo development centers offer services that allow you to print photos on fabrics, and a pillow collage is sure to be a unique keepsake of college memories.

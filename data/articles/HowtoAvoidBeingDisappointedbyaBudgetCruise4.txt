 If you bring a lot of work with you and spend your days on your laptop or cell phone, the budget cruise may pass you by and end in disappointment. To avoid this scenario, you should try to get your work done prior to departure. If you absolutely must work on your cruise, try to schedule short periods of work and then enjoy the rest of your time relaxing., The all-you-can eat buffet is not a challenge to your eating abilities. Arrive early to the buffet and examine the items carefully. Food left out too long on buffet tables is a common cause of food poisoning, which is really not fun when you are out at sea., Internet access is often very poor on budget cruises, so you should avoid it as much as you can. You might end up spending too long getting little done online. Instead, you should check your email and do internet related activities when you come into port., The casino is a real cash grab that could easily end in disappointment. Instead of risking your savings at the on-board casino, save your money for souvenirs and on-board activities that are more likely to bring enjoyment.

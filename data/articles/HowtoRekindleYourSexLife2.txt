 Rekindling the spark in your sex life involves adding a bit of excitement back into your relationship. With the stress, responsibilities, and comfort in your relationship, maybe you and your partner don't touch as much throughout the day. Don't wait until you are behind closed doors or until you have the desire to have sex to touch one another.Touching more often can increase intimacy and shows your partner that you desire them.


Hug each other for longer than usual.
Hold hands.
Give your partner a neck massage.
Playfully brush against them or whisper in their ear.
 Being spontaneous will often involve adding new things suddenly to add excitement. Try sexing, which involves sending a sexy picture of yourself or a suggestive comment to your partner via cell phone. Keep your partner excited about what is to come and discover new sides of each other. Sexting can be new, exciting, and can open sexual communication between you and your partner., It is common to wait for special occasions or for family vacations to take trips with your partner. That's not a bad thing, but it also does not give you and your partner the feeling of excitement or of running away together. Plan a small trip for a few days for the two of you, just because. This will allow both of you to relax, unwind, and get more time to be with each other.


Go to a nearby romantic cabin for a weekend.
Take a short road trip without hotel reservations.
Plan a quick getaway to the closest beach or island.
 Depending on where you are this might include having sex in the kitchen, in the car, or if you get a chance to in an elevator. You can also try having sex at a time that you normally would not, such as the afternoon.The spontaneity will help spice things up and the risk of being “caught” will add to the excitement. This can also increase the urge to have sex in both you and your partner.

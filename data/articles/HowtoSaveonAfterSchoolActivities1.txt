 If your child is playing a sport, the equipment costs can add up quickly. Visit your local secondhand store or check online purveyors of used goods like eBay to pick up some more affordable equipment for your child. Garage sales are also a great source for locating secondhand equipment. You might be able to find gently used:baseball bats
tennis rackets
ice skates
hockey sticks;
, If possible, rent equipment from sporting goods stores or from the program directly. You might also be able to rent equipment from certain online sites. Look for opportunities to rent equipment and save money.Renting uniforms, shoes, and so on is a good idea for children who are still growing, since they might only get limited use out of their equipment before outgrowing it.
 Community sports programs are typically more cost-effective than private sports leagues or lessons. Plus, community sports programs often provide your child with the opportunity to participate in a variety of sports, rather than just a single sport.Get in touch with the community sports division in your local municipality for more information about signing your child up for your community sports league.
 Suppose your child is interested in sports and they enjoy soccer, hockey, and baseball equally. But if the signup fees and equipment costs for one are less than the others, encourage them to sign up for the least expensive after-school activity.Ensure your child is on board with your decision. Don’t sign them up for an after-school activity that they aren’t interested in simply because it is less expensive than the others.
Look for inexpensive options even within the same after-school activity. For instance, if your child wants to join the soccer team, but one team requires that each player must buy their own jersey and ball while another provides them, encourage your child to join the team that doesn’t require members to own their own jerseys and gear.

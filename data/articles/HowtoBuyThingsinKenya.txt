 If you're sure that whatever you want is not running out of stock then don't be in a hurry.;
,, This may be because you are new to that part of town, or of a different race or tribe, or your way of dressing may also determine how much you get charged.

Compare it to his original offer, e.g say he started at Kshs 800, and now he wants to sell it to you at 650, he has given you a discount of 150, then the cost price must be about Kshs 500.
After establishing this, now decide down much you can offer him as a margin above his cost price of 500.
Counter offer by telling him that you want to pay 450.
He/she will disclose to you that that's below the cost price and that he bought it at 500.
Then counter offer again to 550
He will complain.
Then lastly offer him 570(20 shillings above your previous offer)
He will complain that addition of 20 shillings is too minimal.
Then counter offer by making it 50, hence the new price is 600. This is less of his first price of 650.
Remain defiant

, Tell him to wait.
 If you find another shop stocking the same item, Try to get a better price than 600. If it's impossible then go back to the first shop.

 You need one no wider than one or two inches. A paddle iron will be too wide.;
, Spray your hair with a heat protectant. Comb it through thoroughly.
 Start with one side of your head. Gather up the top layers of your hair, leaving just the bottom layer, and pin them back with a butterfly clip. Comb out a one- or two-inch section (the smaller the section, the tighter your curls will be).
 Start about an inch or two from the roots.At this point, you will basically just rotate the iron, and move it down the length of your hair. The direction you rotate it and the speed you move it will depend on the kind of curl you want.








For tight curls, hold the iron vertically, and move down your hair slowly (not so slow that you burn your hair, of course).
For loose curls, hold the iron horizontally, and move down your hair more quickly.
For curls that turn away from your face, twist the iron up, toward the top of your head.
For curls that turn toward your face, twist the iron down, toward the ground.
 Use your finger to twirl your hair in the same direction as the curl. This will help set it in that shape.
 Work from the bottom to the top, and then do the other side of your head the same way. Mist it with hairspray to set it.

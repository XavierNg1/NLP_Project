 Discussing your own mental illness can prevent your children from having a stigma against it. They may feel like if someone they love has a mental illness, it can’t be that scary. Pick a setting in which your child will feel comfortable with you talking about your experience.

Talk to your child one-on-one in a place they feel good about, whether it’s home or on the playground. Allow them to ask you questions and use terms that won’t frighten them., Some parents never bring up mental illness with their children. As a result, they often become afraid of it whenever they encounter it. Bringing it up and talking openly about it may stop them from being afraid and developing their own stigma.

Speaking with your children daily, or as often as you feel comfortable with, about mental health may encourage them to come to you openly if they believe they are experiencing an issue themselves.You might simply say, "Many people struggle with mental illness, which is a normal part of life sometimes. Some conditions may last only a few days or months, and other conditions may last longer. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Two of the most common conditions are anxiety and depression..." Then, go on to paint a picture of what those two disorders may look like in terms of symptoms to help your child better understand.
 There’s a good chance you didn’t go to medical school. Therefore, you likely may not know everything your child wants to know about mental illness and its stigma. That’s OK. Be honest about your limitations and encourage them to continue to ask questions.

For example, you could say, “I’m not sure, but I can try to find out.” This lets them know you want to help them know as much as they want and you are open to discussing the situation even more.Direct your child to other resources, such as videos and Youtube channels that focus on mental health issues like depression.

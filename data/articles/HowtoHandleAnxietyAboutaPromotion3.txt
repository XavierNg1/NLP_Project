 A mentor is someone you know who has a lot more experience than you in your industry. Look to your network for someone you trust and admire who is willing to spend time with you and help you develop professionally. Your mentor will be able to provide you with valuable insight about the promotion process.


Schedule a lunch with your mentor.
Share your concerns and anxieties with your mentor. For example, say something like, “Tom, I’m really nervous about this promotion. I think it entails a level of management I’ve never had before.”
Listen to your mentor. As someone senior in your field, they’ll likely have had similar experiences over the course of their career., Your friends and family will be able to provide you with encouragement about your abilities.


Talk to your significant other. They’ll likely understand your anxieties and insecurities more than anyone else. Thus, they’ll be able to offer comfort that others may not be able to provide.
Practice what you’ll say with your boss with your family. Have friends and family put together mock interviews., By networking with colleagues, you’ll be able to get their opinion on the promotion and what opportunities or challenges you’ll find with it. They may offer new and creative insights that you can apply in your new position.


Trusted colleagues have observed you in the work environment and will be able to give you a good idea of your strengths and weaknesses.
Say something like “I’m really nervous about this new position. Do you think I can handle it?” Most of the time, they’ll answer in the affirmative and tell you why.
Remember to be sensitive to the feelings of people you may work with — you might not be the only one who wanted a promotion.

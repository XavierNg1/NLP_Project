 This "pet" can be held in the palm of the hands and squeezed to reduce tension and exercise the hand muscles.
 Any color is fine, these "pets" can be all colors of the rainbow.
 Stretch it back and forth to make the opening a little looser. This will help placing the filling inside.
 This can be either sand or play dough, depending on your preference. Kids tend to like the play dough because it can be shaped into all sorts of funny configurations that keep their shape after molding.
 Ensure that the sand or play dough do not come into the neck area of the balloon; if you have overfilled it, remove some of the filling, to allow you to tie a knot in the balloon.
 Draw eyes, a smile, a nose, freckles, etc. It's fun to let the kids do this for themselves, as they can style the face in their own way.
 This step is optional but can make the pet look funnier. Add small spikes of yarn to the knot end of the balloon; glue to attach. Keep these pieces short, so that they stand up.
 The balloon pet is now ready for play or stress relief.

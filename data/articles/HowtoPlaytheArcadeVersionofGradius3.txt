 Success depends on the ability to destroy enemies above, below, in front of, and behind you. For beginners, standard missiles or small spread is recommended, along with either 2-way double or Tailgun double, and either a ripple laser or energy laser.;
, Use the first capsule you get for speed up. For the rest of stage 1, you shouldn't need any more speed. Use the next two capsules to obtain missile, then laser or double. After this, focus on obtaining the options, as this will greatly improve your chances of survival.
 The lions in Stage 1 can fire balls of sand from their mouths that fragment if you shoot them. Concentrate on them with your missiles or concentrated standard/double shots. Same goes for the sand dragons and hatches.
 The worm boss has two sets of pincers, and both must be open before you can target it's core. Also, spiders will work their way across the screen, stringing it up with web. The web is harmless, but shoot the spiders to avoid a collision with them. also, try staying in a fixed position shooting at the core. the boss fires a fragmentable shot. Shoot it, and if a fragment is headed towards you, move out of its way, then back.

 Through online sources, your local newspaper, and word of mouth, you can track down flea markets close to your geographic location. Attend these events and see if they meet your needs. Be aware of the clientele attending the event, the quality of the products and businesses on display, and the physical space of the market itself. If these meet your needs and the needs of your jewelry-selling business, check with the administrators of the flea market and find out how to sign up.;
, Connecting with others in your same line of business is one of the most vital steps in learning how to sell jewelry at flea markets. These colleagues can give you candid information on the profitability of a certain flea market, as well as firsthand knowledge of how to register, the cost entailed, and the type of merchandise that will most appeal to a particular market's clientele.
 Once you have determined which market is right for you, fill out the appropriate paperwork to become a flea market jewelry vendor. You will also have to pay a vendor's fee, which will vary from flea market to flea market. Some areas may require you to have a vendor's license or a sales tax license in order to sell your goods, so make sure you check with the local business authorities in your area to ensure you are meeting all the necessary legal criteria.
 As in any business, how you display your merchandise is exceptionally important. Draw up plans for your table and how you will present your jewelry to customers. In general, the glitzier and more memorable your display, the more apt people are to frequent your stall. Experiment with different setups and find the one that best suits your jewelry as well as the personality of your business.

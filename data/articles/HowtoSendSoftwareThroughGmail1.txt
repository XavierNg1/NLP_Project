 All Gmail accounts come with 15 GB of Google Drive storage. Google Drive allows you to upload and share any kind of file without the restrictions for file types that Gmail puts on attachments.When using this method, you'll upload the program's setup or installer file to Google Drive and then share a link to anyone that you want to give the program to. Google Drive also has a much larger file size limit (4 GB), as opposed to Gmail's 25 MB limit.


Since Google Drive is accessed through your web browser, this method works for any operating system and any type of program file.;
, Visit drive.google.com and log in with your Gmail account.
 You can also click the "New" button and select "File upload" to browse for the file on your computer.


Make sure you are uploading the installer or setup file for the program you are sharing. If the program runs without installing but requires multiple files, consider creating a ZIP archive containing all of the necessary files so you only have to upload a single file.
 This may take a while for larger files. You can monitor the progress at the bottom of the window.
,, This link is a direct link to the file that anyone can use to download it.
 Be sure to include any instructions that they may need in order to run or install the program.

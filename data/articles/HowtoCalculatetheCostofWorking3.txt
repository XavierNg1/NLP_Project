 A percentage of taxes is taken out of each paycheck, and that percentage is determined by how much money you earn annually. In the U.S., single individuals who earned between $37,650 and $91,150 in 2016 paid 25% in income tax, while those who earned $190,150 to $413,350 paid 33%.If you are unmarried and earning $60,000 annually, you could be paying $15,000 in income tax every year, which reduces your annual salary to $45,000.
 If you are required to buy new clothing for your job, you may be able to deduct those costs when you pay your taxes. If the clothing is required for you to complete your job and is considered to be in line with industry standards, it may qualify as a business expense.Itemizing these purchases can help reduce the overall cost of working.


Be sure to save your receipts for your business attire purchases.
 When filing your taxes, think about any equipment or supplies that you purchased to complete your job. This can include laptops or other equipment, home office supplies, dues to professional organizations, or professional subscriptions, like a medical or engineering journal subscription.When itemizing electronic devices, however, it is important to consider how much of your time is spent using that item for work. If you are using it for work 80% of the time, then you can deduct 80% of the cost of that item.

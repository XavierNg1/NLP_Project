 Bring a pan nearly full of water to a boil and add some salt. Next, add the pasta into the boiling water and cook it for the recommended time on the package until "al dente" which means cooked but still a little stiff to the bite. Do not let it overcook.









Although you can make your own pasta if desired, many cooks recommend against it for this particular recipe. Fresh fettuccine does not hold up as well as dried fettuccine does, although you're certainly welcome to try.;
, Add the butter, allowing it to melt.
 This should not take longer than a minute.
 Stir constantly to ensure that the garlic does not burn.
 Season well with salt and pepper and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until cream reduces to a thicker consistency. Stir the mixture together, for the duration of the cooking time, making sure the cream does not burn.
 Remove the sauce from the heat.
 Transfer it back into the same saucepan. Take it back to the burner and place on medium heat.
 Incorporate fully. Remove from the heat.
 Just before serving add in the whole leaves of parsley and stir. Then with your tongs, heap a generous portion onto a serving bowl. It goes well with some crusty, Italian bread. Enjoy!









If desired, sprinkle an additional amount of Parmesan or Romano cheese on top of the fettuccine.

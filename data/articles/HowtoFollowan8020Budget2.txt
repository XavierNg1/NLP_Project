 If you are new to budgeting and saving, you may not even have a savings account. Visit your bank, another local bank in your area, or an online bank to begin this process. You will need to make a deposit in order to open this account (this amount will vary by bank).Many typical savings accounts require a $50 deposit, although some may be as low as $20.
Savings account that require larger opening deposits (such as $500) may have accrue interest at a higher rate. (Some high-interest accounts may require you to leave the money alone for a specified length of time, such as 6 months or a year).
You will want to shop around for the highest interest rate you can get for the amount of money you have for your opening deposit.
 Each time you get paid (whether this is weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) immediately transfer 20% to your savings account. Another way to say this is to always “pay yourself first.” Then you can spend the remaining 80% somewhat freely.Consider setting up an automatic withdrawal from your checking account to your savings account that occurs 1-3 days after your receive your paycheck.
Contact your bank to set this up., You might consider keeping your savings in a separate bank, or perhaps even an online bank, such as SmartyPig. You may also be able to turn off the ability to transfer money from savings to checking. Speak to your bank about these options.

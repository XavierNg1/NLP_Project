 Fit shirts loosely over the brace. You don’t want your shirt to hug the brace, which will reveal the shape of the mechanism. You also don’t want to lose your body shape altogether with a shirt which is too baggy. Choose a shirt with shape, but which lays over the brace instead of hugging it.


Guys and girls can wear button down shirts to achieve shape while covering the brace.
Girls should try flowing fabrics and shirts which have detail toward the top and flow out from there.
The brace will make you warmer than usual. When shopping for shirts, consider air flow and lighter material for breathability.
 The thicker the material of your shirt, the less likely the details of the brace will be visible through it. Covering the brace with a sweater or sweatshirt will ensure that the brace does not show through.
 The more embellishments there are to your shirt or dress, the more camouflaged your brace will be. These tricks can include ruffles, tiers, embroidery and patterns. By just choosing a shirt with stripes or plaid, the lines of the brace are going to be less visible.
 You will want a long shirt or a shirt with tails. This is going to cover the part of the brace which extends over your hips. This is especially helpful if you are wearing pants underneath your brace. The long shirt will cover the exposed brace around your hips.


Try button down shirts, sweaters, long t-shirts and tanks.
 If you have a Chêneau brace, you can cover it with an asymmetrical shirt that follows the lines of the brace over one shoulder and longer on that side. This will cover both the extension of the top and the bottom of the brace.


As a bonus, the asymmetrical shape can also help counter the curvature of your spine by creating the illusion of an opposite curve.

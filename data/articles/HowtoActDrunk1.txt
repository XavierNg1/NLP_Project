The more outrageous and disheveled you look, the drunker you'll appear.Having messy hair tells other people that you don't care about being perfect and are here for a good time.
It could also make people think that you've been partying.;
, Alcohol reduces cognitive function.For that reason, many drunk people will drop things frequently. Many times, this includes food and drink. Put ketchup or mustard stains on your shirt and act like you don't notice it or that you don't care.


If someone mentions the stain, respond by saying "Yeah, I know. I don't care."
You can use other things to create stains, but avoid dairy products or any other food that would produce an odor.

 After collection, you should gently invert the sample tube five to ten times. To invert the sample, slowly rotate it upside down then right side up again.Avoid inverting it too roughly or more than ten times, or you could damage the sample., A serum test sample needs to clot in an upright position before the serum can be separated in a centrifuge. After 30 to 60 minutes, place the sample in the centrifuge and spin it at 2200 to 2500 RPM.Be sure to separate the serum in a centrifuge within one hour of collection.
 Place the sample in a leak-proof plastic container with the lab request form packed or labelled on the containerâ€™s exterior. If the lab is off-site, pack the sample container in an appropriate mailing vessel, then send it to the lab for testing.The lab will then expose the sample to the appropriate detection reactants. For example, a lab might use the ELISA technique to expose the sample to an enzyme that detects a viral antibody.

 Add your maple syrup and peanut butter to a saucepan. Boil the mixture on medium heat until it simmers. Whisk it the entire time it's heating, as this will help the peanut butter mix evenly., Once the peanut is mixed in, and you have a steady simmer going, allow the mixture to cook. It should take about 5 minutes for the syrup to cook completely. Continue to stir on occasion, as this will help mix in the peanut butter further., This syrup is best when it's served warm. Allow it cool slightly, so it does not burn your mouth, and then serve.If you have any leftover you can store it in an airtight container in your fridge and then reheat it for later.

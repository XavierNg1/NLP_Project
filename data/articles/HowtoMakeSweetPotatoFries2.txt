 Prepare a shallow baking sheet by spraying it with vegetable spray or by covering it with non-stick aluminum foil or parchment paper.
 Mix the wedges into the oil using your hands or a large wooden or plastic baking spoon. Keeping mixing until you can see that each wedge is coated in oil.
 If you are on a low-sugar diet, you can skip this step, but sugar does enhance the sweetness of the sweet potatoes. Sugar also helps to caramelize the fries.
 Salt and pepper are fairly standard, but you can leave out the paprika and cinnamon if either taste does not appeal to you. Try to sprinkle your spices over the top of your fries evenly to make mixing them easier.
 You can use your hands, but you may find that your hands attract the oily spices, robbing your fries of them. Instead, use a plastic or wooden baking spoon to reduce the amount of spices lost during the mixing process. By the time you finish mixing, you should be able to see spices coating each wedge.
 Spread them out into a single layer. Fries that overlap one another will not cook evenly, so if you have too many fries to fit onto one baking sheet, it is better to use a second baking sheet than to allow your fries to pile up.
 At this point, the tops should begin to look slightly browned. Take the fries out and flip them with a flat spatula or hamburger flipper before returning them to the oven and baking for another 5 to 15 minutes.
 Test one of the fries by breaking it open. The inside should be fairly tender. You can taste one to determine its doneness, but make sure that it has some chance to cool before doing so to prevent your mouth from getting burned.
 Serve them hot as a side dish or snack.

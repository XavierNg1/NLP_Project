 Everything stems from our inability to recognize it. Sometimes we don't see the difference between what is real and what is the creation of our own thinking.;
, Acceptance will elevate you to a better understanding about the problem. Once you accept it's reality, you will open up to a lot of possibilities on how to deal with it. Accepting the facts that trials, troubles and difficulties spare no man and it is as inevitable as the sunrise.
 Now, as soon as you recognize and accept that there is a problem, you need to know what it is. Sometimes during this process, you are already finding the solution to the problem. More often than not, the problem stems from miscommunication or misunderstanding. More than that, this normally leads to blessing in disguise.
 The wise and mature individual can turn a problem into a growth-giving experience. If you have learned how to accept the reality of trouble in your life, if you have learned how to deal with it effectively, then you can be relatively happy.
 We must understand that since problem cannot be avoided, knowledge and skills for dealing with them is not enough. We must possess a healthy dose of courage to rise up and stand the ground and have faith in the Greater Power that creates us, cares about us and watches over our destinies.

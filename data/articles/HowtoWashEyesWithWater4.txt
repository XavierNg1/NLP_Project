 This method is best for washing tired eyes or for washing the eyes of small children who do not understand the other methods. If your eye has been contaminated, then the ideal method is the bowl method.
 Submerge the tip of a clean eyedropper in your solution or water, then depress and release the dropper's bulb to draw water into the dropper.


If you have a sterile plastic syringe, you can also carefully use one that does not have a sharp tip or needle.
 Tilt your head back, raise the dropper just above your open eye, and squeeze the bulb delicately to release a few drops of water.


Ensure that you do not actually touch the dropper to your eyes or eyelashes.
 To get an even coating of the solution across your eye, blink several times. Try to blink the solution into your eye before it pools and run down your cheek instead.
 You may only need a few drops in order to refresh dry, tired eyes. However, you will likely need to repeat the process numerous times in order to actually flush a contaminant out of your eye.
 An alternative method for young children is to dip a clean cloth into the solution before gently dabbing in on the childâ€™s closed eyelid. Even with light pressure, the dabbing will squeeze the solution onto the eyelid and lashes, which the child will then spread over the eyes by blinking.


Repeat as needed, but do not double dip the same spot on the towel into the solution for sanitary purposes. Use a different dry section of the towel, or use a different towel entirely.

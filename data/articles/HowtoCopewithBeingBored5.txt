Teach yourself how to roll a penny between your fingers.
Practice different ways of rolling your tongue. Did you know the different abilities are genetic?
Go and learn an actual skill that you've always wanted to have. It's guitar. It's guitar for everyone.



Have you ever actually read the Bible? It's more entertaining then you'd think. To make it even better, try reading it in a non-standard format, like the Brick Bible (the Bible told in a funny way using Legos, which is available for free online). If you're from a different faith, read the major faith book appropriate for your faith. If you have no faith, learn about other religions and what gives people their desire to pursue a faith. Learning all that you can about the world's religions is never wasted time.
Give comics a whirl. You loved reading them in the paper when you were younger. Did you know you can still read comics online for free? Search "webcomics" and find one that looks good to you. Good ones to start with include "Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal", "Dinosaur Comics", and "What: What If?".
You're sure to have a book you've been neglecting. Your grandma gave one to you three years ago for your birthday. Just read it. Stop procrastinating. It's good for you.

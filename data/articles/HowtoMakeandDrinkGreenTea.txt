 A teapot is the easiest way to do this - it whistles at you when it’s ready, after all. But you can just as easily boil water in another small pot. It is important that the water is boiling and not just heated to ensure proper steeping and flavor.;
, If the leaves do not come in individual serving packages, you will need no more than a small palm-full.
 Whether you’re drinking out of a glass or ceramic cup, you need to place the leaves in the bottom before pouring on the boiling water.
 The tea is done steeping when all or most of the leaves have sunk to the bottom.
 Be careful not to burn your lips or tongue.
 If desired, when you have consumed the majority of the tea, you can add more boiling water on top of the already-used leaves for a second cup. According to some, this second cup is even better than the first.

 Choose the first player and have them spin the bottle in the middle of the circle of shots. All players can sit or stand in a circle around the shots to watch the bottle spin.


The first player can volunteer, or you can choose a fun way to pick who has the first turn, like the youngest person in the group, the winner of a rock-paper-scissors battle, or whoever got out of bed earliest that morning., Wait for the bottle to come to a stop after spinning. The player who spun must drink the shot that the mouth of the bottle is pointing toward.


Don’t let the player smell or examine the shot too closely before drinking it—they must drink it right away!
If the bottle isn’t pointing directly at one shot glass, decide on which it is closest to, or default to the shot to its right. If you continue to have this problem, try adding more shot glasses to make a fuller circle.
 Have the player who spun and drank refill the shot they took. They should refill their shot glass with whatever type of shot (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) they just took.


Players can bluff and keep the type of drink they got or refill with a secret. Agree on this before the game begins.
 Have the person to the left of the first player go next. Repeat the process of spinning, drinking, and refilling for each player.


You can play as many times around the circle of players as you like. Players can opt out any time, or you can make rules that a player is “out” if they spill a drink or get three alcoholic shots in a row, for example.

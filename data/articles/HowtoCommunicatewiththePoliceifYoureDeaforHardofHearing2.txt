 If you need a sign language interpreter to communicate effectively, the police must provide you one. Not every situation requires an interpreter, though. Generally, if you need to discuss something important or talk with the police for an extended period of time, you can ask for an interpreter.For instance, if you’re pulled over for speeding, an interpreter probably isn’t necessary.
However, if the police want to interview or question you, you have the right to an interpreter to ensure communication is clear and accurate for everyone.
 The police cannot search your personal belongings, such as your pockets or the trunk of your car, unless they have evidence that you’ve been involved in something illegal. You can refuse to be searched by saying or writing, “I do not give you permission to search my private property.”, Make a written request to talk to an attorney and to have an interpreter explain your rights to you. Until these things happen, you’re not obligated to answer any questions., Gather as much information as you can, such as the name and badge number of the police officer involved, a thorough description of what happened, and contact information for any witnesses. Contact the headquarters of the officer involved, and they will tell you how to file your complaint.

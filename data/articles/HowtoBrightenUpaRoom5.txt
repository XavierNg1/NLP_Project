 Here are some creative ways to make a room feel larger, brighter and more stylish with mirrors.


Find antique mirrors and hang them close together. It will look like an art installation and reflect light around the room.






Use a long and skinny mirror on a large wall to make a room look wider. Place it across from a large window to reflect more light from the outside into your room.






Take small square mirrors and tile a wall where you wish there was a window. It will give the illusion that you have an extra window. Set up floor length mirrors in hallways or nooks.
 A glass or mirrored coffee table, wall hanging or vase may increase the open feeling of the room while attracting more light. Opt to replace knobs on your furniture with glass knobs., Take the minimalist approach toward decorating, in any room you want to feel airy and light. Remove knick-knacks, bookshelves and collections in favor of 1 or 2 vases and statement pieces.


Consider removing end tables, file cabinets, TV stands and ottomans, if they just end up collecting clutter. You can hang electronics directly on the walls. , If you need extra privacy, put in light cellular blinds behind the curtains. Sheer materials that drape down will allow more light into the room than thick or dark panels.


If you have very few windows in the room, consider keeping them unfurnished to let in more light.

 This practice will demonstrate to your employer that you are genuinely interested in ensuring that the work you provide consistently exceeds expectations.


Follow up with your boss or client to determine if they are satisfied with your work and ask for feedback on ways you can improve your work.
 When you establish strong personal and professional relationships with your co-workers, you are more likely to be presented with a larger amount of work opportunities, promotions, and projects.


Discuss work-related matters in person instead of through email, and take the time to eat lunch with your co-workers and participate in team-building events.
 When you fail to reply to the inquiries and needs of your bosses and co-workers, they may approach somebody else with their request or assign the project to another co-worker.


Respond to correspondence immediately regardless of when you can handle the project or inquiry. For example, if an employee sends you a question, but you are in the middle of a major project, reply stating that their concern is valuable to you, but that you will address their question after your project deadline is met.
 This will demonstrate to your boss that you are genuinely ready to acquire new skills or take on a larger work load to exceed expectations in your current position.


Volunteer for additional work projects. Volunteering for extra work will demonstrate to your boss and co-workers that you are passionate to learn new skills and may provide you with recognition or awards.
Ask your boss or a representative in human resources specifically what you need to accomplish in order to receive a promotion within your department or company.

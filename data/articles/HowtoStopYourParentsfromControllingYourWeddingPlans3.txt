 Conversations over text or email can be easily misconstrued. When possible, speak to your parents in person or by phone to discuss important wedding matters., Your parents might be trying to control every aspect of your wedding because they feel that they don’t have a say. Talk to them to find out what they care about the most and see if they have any concerns that they haven’t told you about.You might find that your mom trying to pick the bridesmaid’s dresses really comes from her desire to be involved in general. Pick a few potential dresses and then get her input on the ones she likes the best. Involve her in other ways, as well.
 Though you are likely frustrated that they are trying to control your day, try to be as understanding as possible. Your parents probably care about you very much and want your wedding to be perfect. Your wedding will be one day, but they are your parents forever.However, your parents may have always been controlling and overbearing. Understand that this has been their dynamic with you since you were a child and work to change that now so that you can have your wedding as you like it.
 If you are about to attend a family function or any other gathering that your parents will be at, call in the reinforcements. Ask your other family members to exist as a buffer and take up for you and advocate for your autonomy in your wedding.For instance, if you know your dad is trying to get you to select a certain caterer that you don’t want for the wedding, you might tell your sister beforehand so that she can tell him it’s your decision and that she likes the food you’ve chosen.
 If you have a wedding planner, consider using them as a buffer when having conversations with your parents. They are there to help you create your vision, not your parents. They can also be objective when the two of you might be emotional and can provide solutions or compromises that you may not have considered.

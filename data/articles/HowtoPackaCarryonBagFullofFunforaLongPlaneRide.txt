 A good carry-on bag should be small enough and light enough that you can carry it easily. However, it should not be so small that it cannot fit everything you need. It also must be small enough that it fits under the seat in front of you or in the overhead bin. There are many types of bags that work well as carry-on luggage. Any one of the following choices are valid alternatives These bags include:

A duffel bag. If you choose to use a duffel bag, it should have good handles and/or an over-the-shoulder strap.



 


A small wheeled suitcase
This should be small enough to fit in the overhead bin.






A backpack.
This backpack should be of a fairly large size with many pockets. It also should be sturdy and durable. If it gets dirty or broken, you shouldn't have to worry about it.






A messenger bag.
This bag should have an adjustable strap. This is one of the lesser alternatives, as it is much less comfortable to carry a messenger bag over one shoulder than it is to carry a backpack on two.

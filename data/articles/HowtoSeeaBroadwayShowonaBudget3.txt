 If you're in school and on a tight budget but can't afford to miss a show, student rush tickets are absolutely the way to go. These are discounted tickets that can be purchased at the box office on the day of the performance by showing a valid student ID. The first thing you need to do when planning to buy rush tickets is check the website for the show you want to see for the specifics of their student rush policy. (There are general guidelines, but every production and venue is different. Some shows sell general rush tickets that can be purchased without a student ID.)

, While some shows allow the purchase of rush tickets in advance online, for most shows you'll need to go to the box office. Depending on the popularity of a show, rush tickets sell out very, very quickly. The day's rush tickets go on sale as soon as the box office opens, so a popular show may have prospective rush ticket buyers lined up at dawn.
 In some cases, rush tickets can be purchased with a credit card, but many shows' rush tickets must be paid for in cash. Check the show's website before you get in line, but if payment method is unspecified, it is safe to assume that you'll need cash.
 Because a limited number of tickets are sold as rush tickets, there is virtually always a limit of one or two tickets per person, depending on the show.

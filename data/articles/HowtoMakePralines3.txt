 These pralines differ because you bake them instead of boiling them in a pan. Preheat your oven at 350 degrees. Put the oven rack in the middle position.
 Measure out all the ingredients into one bowl. Stir them until they are well blended together. The nuts should be completely covered in the mixture.


This recipe is nuttier than others. If you want to have a more balanced ratio of candy to nuts, reduce the amount of nuts to 1 cup.
 Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spoon all the ingredients from your bowl onto the baking sheet. Use a rubber spatula to remove any excess honey and sugar from the sides of the bowl. Spread the mixture into a thin layer.


You can use aluminum foil if you want. Don't use wax paper because it will melt in the oven.
 Place the baking sheet onto the middle rack in the oven. Let the mixture bake for 8 minutes. Take the pan out of the oven. The honey and sugar should be melted and bubbling along the pan. Using a heat resistant spatula, stir the nuts into the mixture, coating them completely. Put the pan back into the oven for 3 more minutes. Take them out and stir them one more time. Put them back in the oven for three final minutes.
 Take the pan out of the oven. They should be darker now. Spread the nuts back into a single layer. Allow them to cool. Once they are completely cool, pull them off the parchment paper. They will start to break apart. Take the larger pieces and break them into smaller ones. You can use your hands or a knife. Serve and enjoy.

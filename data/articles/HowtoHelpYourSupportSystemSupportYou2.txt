 Think about your family members, friends, coworkers, and other people in your life, such as therapists. Ask yourself who you trust and rely on the most. These people make up the core of your support network.Consider people who have helped you out in the past, who always give you good advice, and who you want to call right away when something important happens in your life.
 Keep your relationships strong by taking the initiative to stay in touch. Ask a friend you haven’t seen in a while to watch a movie with you, or send a funny card to a family member who lives far away. When you show people that you care enough to maintain a connection, they’ll be likely to do the same for you.Avoid assuming that people will contact you if they want to spend time together. They may be thinking the same thing about you.
 Grow your support system by getting involved in your community. You can make like-minded friends by joining clubs related to your interests, participating in a support group for an issue you’ve experienced, or doing volunteer work for a good cause.Keep in mind that it’s best not to ask too much of new friends while the relationship is still developing. Avoid bringing up heavy or personal topics until you know the person better.
 Your friends and family members will get worn out if you ask too much of them. If you need more help than one or two people can reasonably give, spread your requests out among numerous people in your support system.For instance, if you have a broken leg that prevents you from doing chores and running errands, don’t ask one friend to cover everything for you. Instead, ask a couple of friends to give you a hand around the house, and see if your family member, neighbor, or friend will run errands for you.

 If you teach high school, college or post graduate classes, encourage your students to follow you on Twitter.


Answer questions, make announcements and encourage discussions outside of the classroom via Twitter.
 School districts are tweeting announcements such as school closings and teachers can tweet about classroom topics and upcoming projects for parents who follow.
 Share websites, books, articles and other information that will help your students learn.
 Use Twitter to ask for suggestions, take polls and discuss recommendations or ideas that students, parents and the school community might have.
 Include a brief word or two on why the information is important to your classes.

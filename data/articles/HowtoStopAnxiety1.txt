 Deep belly breathing is one of the most effective ways to quickly reduce anxiety.You can do deep breathing anywhere and it only takes a few minutes to feel the effects.To practice deep breathing, find a quiet place and sit or lay down in a comfortable position.
Place your hands over your stomach, just below your ribcage.
Take in a long, slow breath as you count to five. Concentrate on pulling the air into your abdomen, rather than just into your chest.
Then, hold the breath for a few seconds and exhale it slowly.
Keep inhaling and exhaling slowly into your belly for about five to 10 minutes.;
, Progressive muscle relaxation is also a quick way to reduce anxiety.Progressive muscle relaxation is when you tense and release the muscles in your body one at a time, moving from the tips of your toes to the top of your head.To practice progressive muscle relaxation, start by laying down someplace comfortable.
Close your eyes and then tighten the muscles in your toes by curling your toes under.
Then, release the tension in your toes and tense your feet by flexing them.
Then, release this tension and move to your calves.
Continue to tense and release the muscles in your body one by one until you reach your forehead.

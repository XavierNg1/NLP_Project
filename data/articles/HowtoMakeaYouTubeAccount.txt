 Before you start an account, understand a few things:


In creating a YouTube account, you are also creating a Gmail account. This will appear as @gmail.com.
In creating a YouTube account, you are also creating a Google+ account. Google+ is Google's social network, similar to Facebook. You will be able to adjust your setting in the Google+ tab at the top of your browser when you log in to YouTube or Gmail. If you do not want a Google+ account, can delete it while still keeping your YouTube account.
What you do on YouTube is separate from what you do on Google's various sister sites. If you do something on YouTube, it will not be visible on Google+, for example.;

If you already have a Gmail account, you should have a YouTube account. Use your Gmail username and password to log into YouTube.
 Fill out your e-mail address, user name, date of birth, gender and click “I Accept”.
 To cut down on fake accounts or accounts managed by bots, Google sometimes will make you provide verification.
, On your profile page, you can add a main picture and your own background, among other things. Try to express yourself.
 Once you have signed up for a YouTube account, you can:


Make and add videos to the YouTube community.
Track your favorite users by subscribing to their channel.
Manage your favorite tracks, videos, and online episodes.
Comment on videos and socialize with other members of the community.

 Picasa is a free image management program developed by Google. You can use it to sync any images on your computer to your Google+ Photos page. You can download Picasa for Windows or Mac from the Picasa website.


Windows - Run the downloaded Setup file. After setup is complete, Picasa will scan the folders you designate for images.
Mac - Double-click the Picasa archive that you downloaded. Click and drag the Picasa icon into your Applications folder. You can then drag it from Applications to your Dock if you want to access it easier. When you fist launch Picasa, it will ask which folders you would like to scan for images.
 Click the "Sign in with Google Account" link in the upper-right corner of the Picasa window. A log in window will appear, allowing you to enter your Google username and password. If you have 2-Step Verification enabled, you will be asked for your verification code.


Logging in with your account lets you sync your images to your Google+ page.
 You can upload individual pictures to Google+ by right-clicking on them and selecting "Upload to Google+", or clicking the "Share on Google+" button. You can choose which album you'd like to put it in, as well as set who it is shared with.


If you'd like to upload a whole folder of images, select the folder in the left navigation menu, and then click the "Share" button. By default, you will be asked if you want to create a new album based on the folder name. Again, you can choose to share the images, or move them into a preexisting album.
 You can set your picture folders to always sync so that any changes in the folder are automatically added to your Google+ photos. To do so, select the folder that you want to sync from the left navigation menu, and then click the "Sync to Web" toggle on the right side of the window.


You can adjust your sync settings by clicking the "Change Settings" button. You can change the image quality, confirmation settings, watermarks and more.

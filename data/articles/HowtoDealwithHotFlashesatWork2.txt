 Alcohol and coffee can dehydrate you and make you sweat, making your hot flashes even worse. Rather than have a cup of coffee in the morning at work, go for a glass of cold water or room temperature herbal tea. You should also avoid alcoholic beverages, opting for non-alcoholic drinks instead.Get in the habit of bringing a big glass of water with you to meetings at work. You may also carry a water bottle with you or keep one at your desk so you have access to cold water at all times.
 Spicy foods can cause your body temperature to rise and make your hot flashes worse. Avoid foods that have seasonings like hot pepper, cayenne, or chili powder. Stick to foods that have more neutral seasonings like salt and pepper as well as citric seasonings like lemon or lime.You should also avoid food that is hot in temperature, as it can make you feel even hotter during a hot flash. Have meals at room temperature or food that is chilled and avoid piping hot foods like hot soup or hot stew.
 Plant based foods contain plant estrogens, which can help to lessen the number of hot flashes you experience and the severity of your hot flashes. Try adding plant based foods like soybeans, chickpeas, lentils, flaxseed, beans, and grains to your lunches for work. You can also have more fresh fruits and vegetables as part of your daily lunch at work.Try to pack your own lunches so you can control what you eat. If you do eat out, look for meals that contain a lot of plant based foods.
 Healthy protein can also help to increase your hormone production, which can help prevent hot flashes. Try having healthy protein options like yogurt, grass-fed meats, eggs, and soymilk as part of your diet. Nut butters like cashew and almond butter are also good protein sources.You can add these protein sources in the form of a soymilk smoothie for breakfast or a snack of fruit and almond butter at work.

 Ask them where their really old games are. Usually you might be presented with a bargain bin. Dig through until you find it. Then purchase it. You can usually get old games for less than a buck.

, If you had no luck with the game stores, try shopping online. Use sites like Price Grabber or Google to browse through selections. It might take effort. Then, compare prices, and buy from the cheapest site that allows non registered users to buy stuff. Remember to check site reputations through WOT or SiteAdvisor. Then, simply enter your information.
 Then, start playing your game.
 Sometimes you can ask people in your town where you can get copies. Inquire with friends, especially friends who have old game consoles like you. Ask if they have what you're looking for. If so, they might let you borrow it or even give it to you if they don't play it much.
 If you're game isn't obscure, you may find it on online purchasing services like Xbox live or Wii shop channel. Search those, if you have a Wii, Xbox 360 or Playstation 3. Remember to have appropriate points cards or purchase with a credit card.
 If all else fails, you may need to consider an emulated version of the game. For some games, like weekend-only promotion/competition games, this could be required. Again, do your research, and make sure you download the required software. Also check to see that the site is reputable. With all that squared off, you're ready to play. It might not be "classic gaming", but it's the best you've got.

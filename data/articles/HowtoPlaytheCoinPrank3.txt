 For this trick you will need any type of coin and a pencil. A higher value coin will work better for this prank. Use the pencil to color along the edge of the entire coin. Try not to hold the coin by the edge, or else you’ll get pencil markings on your hand.
 Find a willing subject to pull the prank on. Tell them you will give them a coin, say “quarter” or “nickel,” if they can roll the coin down the length of their face without lifting it. Get them to start at the forehead, and see if they can reach their chin.


Give them three attempts to try it. They will feel determined to get the coin to roll down their face and be left with several marks on their face., Don’t be cruel and let them walk around for the rest of the day with pencil on their face. Tell them they’ve been fooled and to look in a mirror. Once they realize they’ve been tricked, give them the coin. It is a nice gesture you can offer for their cooperation.

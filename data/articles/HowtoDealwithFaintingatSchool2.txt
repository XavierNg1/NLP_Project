 Although it may be best for you if you have 1 or 2 days off to recover, it can also be difficult to return to the embarrassment. As soon as your physically able, not before, return to school.
 Just say, "Ok, can we talk about, (insert interesting thing), now? This can really help to distract people from what happened to you.
 It may help if you jot your feelings down on paper, in a diary, etc. Then, try to solve them. If you feel embarrassed, think about these people you have to face in your position. Imagine them flat on the floor with their eyes rolled back in their head, looking very scary. If you feel scared about future fainting, consider when you fainted. If you fainted in a hot classroom, if you feel hot, ask to open a window. Don't be afraid to ask. If you fainted in the halls during the change of periods, consider waiting back a few seconds to miss the main crowd. Unless this will make you late for your class. What ever your negative feeling may be, come up with a solution to it.
 If people are still talking about it after a month or so, this may be a good idea anyway. If your friends embarrass you about it, you might want to reconsider this friendship. If they embarrass you, maybe they aren't good friends.
 Just to check.

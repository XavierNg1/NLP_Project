 If you are experiencing extreme pain that seems to be getting worse, or if your feet no longer fit in your shoes, consult a physician right away. It's possible to slow or halt the progression of bunions, but you can't actually cure them on your own.
 In some cases the doctor will advise you as to lifestyle changes and prescribe a medication for the pain. To prevent the bunion from getting worse, be sure to follow the doctor's advice.
 As a last resort, consider having surgery to remove the bunion, shave the bone of your big toe and realign your big toe with the other toes. Bunion surgery is common and considered to be the only cure for bunions.


There are several options for a bunionectomy surgery. Conduct research with your doctor to find out which option is best for you.
Surgery usually helps bunions, but it doesn't guarantee that you will be completely free of pain, or that your toe will look perfectly straight.
Follow up the surgery with proper lifestyle changes and exercises to prevent future pain and inflammation.

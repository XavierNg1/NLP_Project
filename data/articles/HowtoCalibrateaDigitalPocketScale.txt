 Cleaning your scale prior to calibration helps ensure the scale provides the most accurate reading possible.


Avoid placing excess pressure on the weighing surface when cleaning your scale, as this may damage the strain gauge, which is vital for providing accurate readings.;
, The cloth must only be slightly damp to prevent water and moisture from getting inside your scale.


Open the battery compartment, remove the batteries, and wipe the inside of the battery compartment, if using a battery-operated scale. This can also help you identify whether battery corrosion is affecting performance or calibration.
 These tools can be useful when a soft cloth fails to remove caked-on debris.
 A flat, level surface provides the most accurate calibration and digital readings.


Use a carpenter’s level to help you determine whether the surface is level.
 Mouse pads are ideal for preventing and limiting vibrations that can interfere with the calibration process.
, These buttons will zero out your scale and clear any saved data from a previous weigh-in.
 The instructions for placing your device in calibration mode will vary depending on the make and model of your scale. Your scale may self-calibrate, or require you to press a series of buttons to trigger calibration mode.


Refer to your scale’s manual or contact its manufacturer to determine how to place your device in calibration mode.
 A calibration weight is a solid item that usually features no air cavities and helps determine the accuracy of your scale reading. Calibration weights normally range anywhere from 1 mg to 30 kg.


Use a new, shiny U.S. coin if you lack a calibration weight. Pennies made after 1983 weigh exactly 2.5 g, nickels made after 1866 weigh 5 g, dimes made after 1965 weigh 2.268 g, and quarters made after 1965 weigh 5.670 g., For example, enter “5 g” if using a U.S. nickel as a calibration weight. The scale will store and use the data entered to weigh other items.
 Your scale is now calibrated.

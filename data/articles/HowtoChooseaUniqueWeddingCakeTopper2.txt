 Your wedding may have a general theme, like spring or autumn, or it might be more specific, like a sci-fi wedding. In either case, you can choose a topper that fits with this theme. For example, you might choose:


A Mr. and Mrs. Snowman topper for winter wedding themes.
C-3PO and R2-D2 for a sci-fi wedding.
A hula boy and girl for a Hawaiian themed wedding.
 If you are concerned your wedding topper might clash with other wedding decorations, match it with your wedding color scheme. Think of items associated with the color scheme of your wedding. For example:


For a white/blue scheme, you might choose two snowflakes and give one snowflake a hat. This way the snowflake with the hat can represent the groom.
A white and black scheme could be matched with bride and groom penguin toppers.
A scheme with yellow in it might be complimented with a daffodil topper for the bride and a sun topper for the groom., Wedding cakes often have floral designs. These can be further accentuated by using real flowers as the topper for your cake. You could also use a large centerpiece of flowers that are the same as the flowers you used to decorate for your wedding.Coordinate your cake topper with nature-themed and seasonal items. In autumn, you might feature brightly colored leaves, while an outdoor wedding might be suited to fresh herb sprigs as a topper.
Be sure to tell the florist you buy the flowers from that you intend on using the flowers as a cake topper. Flowers used on cakes have to be specially prepared so as to not dirty the cake.

 Hedgehogs have a strong sense of smell. Your hedgehog must be able to smell you and associate your scent with safety. This will help him become more outgoing and comfortable with you handling him. Place a t-shirt that you have worn for the whole day in your hedgehog's cage.Do not wash the shirt before you place it in the cage.
The shirt should not have any loose threads.
Your hedgehog will use your shirt as a blanket.
 Sleep with a fleece that is the size of your hedgehog's sleeping area for 2 or 3 nights. Once the fleece has your smell, place it in your hedgehog's sleeping area. If your hedgehog uses a sleeping bag, you can sleep with the sleeping bag for a few nights before you allow your hedgehog to use it.A baby receiving blanket can be used as well.
Fleece and vellux fabrics are preferred because you do not have to worry about fraying or loose threads., Any time you use a new lotion, perfume, or soap, you are introducing a new smell. Your hedgehog may be confused and not recognize you. Try to be consistent with the scents that you wear.


If your hedgehog likes a new scent, he may begin to anoint (i.e. froth from the mouth and spread the foam on his quills).Your hedgehog may also react to a strong scent by becoming irritated.

 It's important to eat at the same time every day and develop a consistent eating schedule. This establishes an internal clock for your hunger triggers and it will greatly reduce the odds of having extreme cravings because you will be consistently keeping your body satisfied and full.


When you're eating, try to avoid any types of distractions. This will help you to consume your food at a good pace. If you're distracted, you will tend to eat faster and may not even realize that you're doing so. When this happens, you likely won't know when you're full and will continue to eat beyond what is necessary. If you eat without distraction, it can help you to become full with raw foods and stay full longer. This makes you less likely to reach for non-raw foods in addition to the raw foods you consumed.
 You can meet people in your area who are also doing the diet by joining a local support group. If there are no support groups in your area created for people who are doing the raw food diet, consider starting one up! Just having a few people to lean on during your adjustment period can make a tremendous difference in your ability to stay on track. People who share the same goal as you will help you keep to your diet and will also offer an excellent example showing you the benefits of what you're doing.
 Everyone knows that exercise is a great way to stay healthy, but it also has other benefits. Exercising keeps positive energy around you and will also help to curb your cravings for bad food. Any type of exercise that involves meditation is beneficial and will help you stay on track because the spiritual factor of the exercise will help you stay focused on your goals.

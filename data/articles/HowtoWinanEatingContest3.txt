 There are some basic things that apply to many competitive eating competitions:


Find out if "chipmunking" is permitted - this is the practice of stuffing in as much food as possible before chewing it and swallowing - usually there will be a time limit on how long you can keep this in your mouth;






Find out if "dunking" is permitted - this is where you are allowed to dunk your food in water to make it softer and easier to swallow; be aware, however, that doing this is considered fairly disrespectful of the food;Know whether or not you can make a mess eating. Some contests insist that you keep the area clean (picnic-style), others let you make a mess. It all depends on the type of food you're eating and how much mess you think you might make. Picnic-style is probably better for amateurs, as it encourages you to pace yourself and be conscious of the eating process as it is happening, rather than simply gorging yourself silly.Understand that vomiting is considered to be a disqualification in most eating contests. If you get to this point, you're probably not enjoying yourself anyway!







, While that may sound odd, it is important not to panic or rush, but to eat steadily with speed. If you panic or rush, you will make mistakes and be less successful.
 While it's competitive, it's meant to be "fun competitive" and if you're taking it too seriously, then it's probably better to play a ball game to release your pent-up energy.
 Let your body settle back into its normal routine and eat as usual the following day, or when you feel ready.

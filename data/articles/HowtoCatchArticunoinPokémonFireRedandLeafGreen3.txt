 If you miss this chance to catch the bird, you will not get another one. Avoid this mishap by saving before you click on the bird. Approaching and hitting A will trigger the fight, so prepare your team and save before starting., Fight the Pok√©mon like you'd fight any other you wanted to catch. When possible, use moves that deal damage but aren't super effective, as you don't want to unintentionally knock the bird out. Normal moves like Slash are good, as are moves like False Swipe. To help you capture the bird, remember it's strengths and weaknesses:



Weak Against: Fire, Electric, Rock (x2, so be careful with Rock attacks), and Steel.

Strong Against: Grass, Ground, Bug, and Dragon., Once you've weakened it enough, it's time to slow it down and make it easier to catch. Obviously, the lower the health you can get it to the better, but don't risk knocking it out if your attacks are hitting strongly. Use Sleep Powder, Paralysis, Thunder Wave to ensure that Articuno is lulled out of combat, making it easier to catch., Even if an Ultra Ball fails, it makes the next one slightly more likely to succeed. That means you 10th attempt at catching the bird will be far more likely to succeed that the last. Keep Articuno paralyzed or asleep and you'll scoop it up in no time.

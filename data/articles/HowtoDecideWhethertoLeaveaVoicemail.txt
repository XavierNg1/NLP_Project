 Then just tell them the topic and to call you back.
If you were calling to tell them a quick, funny joke, go ahead and leave it for them in VM form. They may appreciate the entertainment. As long as it isn't a long involved story.
If you don't need them to call you back. What I mean by that is, if the only reason you needed to call was to give them some specific information, then give it to their VM. That way you don't have to worry about still trying to get in touch, and its out of your hands.;
, This is no time for VMs because you are more likely to leave a long, annoying VM. If you were calling to chat, the only thing they need to know is that you called. They'll see a missed call from you and call you back if they want to talk.
If you are drunk. Yes we've all seen it before, Drunk Dialing(DD). When you are Drunk dialing someone, you are more likely than not going to make an ass of yourself. Drunk VMs are even worse!!! Avoid them at all costs!
If you know they are with phone. If they didn't pick up, its possible that they don't want to talk to you right then. It might be best if you didn't hound them with a demanding VM. They will know you called, give them a chance to call you back when they want to.
If you are in a loud place. There's nothing more annoying than a voicemail that's just a bunch of noise. Especially if its long too.
 Don't leave a voicemail unless you think they want to hear one! If you think they will enjoy it, or benefit from hearing it in some way, then leave one. Otherwise, don't.

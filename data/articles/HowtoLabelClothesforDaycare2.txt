 The most basic way to label a childâ€™s clothes is with permanent marker, which is safe and works on most types of fabric. Choose a dark color marker like black, brown, or blue and label the clothing in an inconspicuous location, such as clothing tag or along the back inside neck seam.


Permanent markers are the least intrusive method in regards to daycare activity, and will stay in place no matter what activity your child pursues.
 For an even more permanent label, or if you are labeling delicate fabrics like lycra or silk, use a laundry pen, which works the same as a regular marker.


Let the marker dry for a few minutes before putting the clothes on your child.
 Permanent marker can fade after lots of washes, so you may have to re-label the clothes every few months.


Permanent markers and laundry pens are available at any office supply store or big box distributor and are definitely the least expensive labeling option.

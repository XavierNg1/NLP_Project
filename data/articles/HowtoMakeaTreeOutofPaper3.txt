 Lay the bag flat on a table. Use a ruler to make a mark on the brown bag four inches up from the bottom of the bag., Use scissors to cut the top of the bag down to the mark you made on each of the four sides of the bag. Open the bag up to cut each of the four sides.


You should end up with the top of the bag cut into four sections.
 Twist the entire bag into one big twist. This will give the tree an aged look. Untwist the bag, and open the bag up again., Twist the bottom of the bag at the mark you previously made. This should make the bag have the bottom open a bit, and be twisted tight at the mark you made., The four sections at the top of the bag will be the major branches of the tree. To create the branches, cut each of the four sections into thinner strips and twist each strip into a branch.


Take the first section and twist it halfway up starting at the base of the section.
Cut the end of the first section down to the twisted section. You can make one, two, or three cuts.
Twist each new section. You can twist it all the way to the end, or stop halfway and make more cuts to twist.
Continue until everything is twisted into a branch.
Repeat this with all four main sections. Try to make each one slightly different.
 Use scissors to make four small snips around the base of the tree. Then, gently twist each section into four roots.
 Stand your tree up to observe it. Make any needed tweaks to the branches to get the tree how you want it. You can cut leaves out and glue them on your tree if youâ€™d like, but the brown bag tree looks great as is too.

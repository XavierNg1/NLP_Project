 Small notes can be affixed directly to the pencil you are using on the test to help you with questions you know will be on the test. Write the notes down on a thin strip of paper and cover the entire strip with a clear piece of tape. Wrap the strip around the pencil from top to bottom. All you have to do to read the note is turn the pencil!;
, Wooden pencils will accept certain kinds of ink along their body, allowing you to write simple short notes, such as dates or equations. Use a pen to write these notes down and allow the ink to dry so that it is not easily smeared away by your hand. You may also use a small paper clip or other sharp item to etch notes into the wood of the pencil.


This works best on pencils that are hexagonal in shape, as the flat surface makes it easier to write.
A small wood-etching tool may also be used if you happen to have one handy. Make sure the tip of the tool is fine enough for small print., Similar to taping information to the pencil itself, notes can be written on a small strip of paper and placed along the inside of a mechanical pencil. An advantage to layering the strip along the inside of the mechanical pencil is the natural camouflage the mechanical pencil provides. Note that this will only work with translucent mechanical pencils.


Keep a few “spare” mechanical pencils on your desk to increase the number of notes you have available.

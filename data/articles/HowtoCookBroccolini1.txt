 Fresh broccolini will also have fresh bases, firm stems, and tightly furled heads.If the florets are beginning to turn yellow, the broccolini is no longer good. The same applies if the bases appear dried out, if the stems have soft spots, or if there are signs of flowering on the heads.
Broccolini should be stored in a tightly sealed plastic bag or container inside the refrigerator until ready to use.;
, Use a sharp kitchen knife to chop off any leaves and any thick ends, cutting off enough to separate the thinner upper stalks into separate pieces.

If the thin stalks are connected by a single thick stalk, this thick portion of the stalk holding the bundle together should be cut off.
If any of the stalks you use are still a little too thick, you can trim them in half lengthwise for more manageable pieces.
 Quickly rinse the stalks under cool, running water and pat dry with clean paper towels.

Broccolini is usually mostly free of dirt and debris, so it needs little more than a quick rinse to clean.

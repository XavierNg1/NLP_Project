 In many historical battles, if either side has the higher ground such as fortified hills, mountains, etc. The side that has control over that particular area will have a better chance of winning. In this game, sometimes hills require at least two minutes to run to the peak of the hill. The sides of the hills could help any player undetectable from the other sides of the mountain.
 After selecting the first tab labeled “Infantry” the menu below shows several “ranks”. One of them gives other allied players buffs such as an “officer” rank gives an accuracy bonus, etc. Basically if you’re something other than ranker you give speed, melee, accuracy and reloading boosts. The types of ranks are very beneficial and may increase the chances of winning.

 Look everywhere except for the person you are speaking to. Stare at your shoes, look at the door, or out the window. The speaker will soon pick up on your vibe.;
, If you are sitting, try to slouch and lean backwards in your chair at the same time. You might want to stare at your hands and/or tap your feet together.
 Remember to be convincing, though.
 If you can't stutter, then just say "um" or "uh" before, in between, and after saying something.
 Also, look around the room and scratch your head or ear every once in a while.

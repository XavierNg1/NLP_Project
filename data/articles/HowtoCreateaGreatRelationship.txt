 This is something that you need to do for yourself, so that you're aware what you hope to contribute to the relationship and what you hope the relationship will be for you.


Ask yourself "What kind of relationship do I want?" This could be anything from someone to spend time with to having a long-term relationship and maybe marriage or lifelong friendship.;
,


Put yourself out there to meet this person (parties, gatherings, online dating and so forth).
 The aim is to have fun while getting to know people.


Talk to people that interest you and just be calm, relaxed and have fun.



Set up a time and place to meet them.
 When you meet them for first time the secret is creating a great relationship is in the questions you ask them about themselves. Spend a lot of time listening and learning.


Get a sense of their beliefs, morals and relationship patterns. (Keep it subtle at first date and intensify the questions as you progress to more dates)
1000 Questions for couples is a great tool which you can get below.
 Know that if they don't answer the question as you would ideally like for a good intimate match, they can always be a great friend.
 Don't think about a month or year from now. Most importantly, aim to have fun!

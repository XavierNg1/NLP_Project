 Vinegar is a very effective cleaner and is a harmless natural cleaner. It should be your first choice for cleaning and preventing any “unwanted additives” and other dirt or bacteria on your child's toys., Combine two parts warm water and one part white vinegar. The acid in the vinegar will naturally dissolve most of the dirt, so you do not need to use soap.


Apple cider vinegar is also very effective at cleaning bath toys. However, white alcoholic vinegar is the best choice because it is colorless and is less likely to leave any unwanted residue., Bath toys usually have a hole on the bottom of the toy that makes a sound when they are squeezed, but this hole can also allow water to get into the inside of the toys. If water sits inside the toy, it can develop bacteria and promote the growth of mold. So always squeeze out any excess water and let the toys dry thoroughly.
 Let the toys soak for at least 10-15 minutes. Make sure the solution also gets into the inside of the toy, where dirt can accumulate.
 Scrub in all directions and on the entire surface of the toy using a small brush or toothbrush.


If there are narrow areas or small openings on the toy, scrub these surfaces using the tip of the brush. For example, to clean the inside of a rubber duck’s beak, put the brush inside the beak and scrub the surface in a circular motion.
 Use clean water to rinse the toys and allow them to dry completely in the sun or on a dry towel before allowing your child to use them.

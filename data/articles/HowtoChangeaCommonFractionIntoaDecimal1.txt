 Let's say we're working with the problem 3/4. Simply write a "4" outside the division bar with a "3" on the inside. The "4" is your divisor, and the "3" is your dividend.;
, Since you're working with a fraction, you know that your answer will be less than one, so this first step is necessary. After you do this, you'll need to place a decimal after the 3 under the division bracket and write an additional zero after it. Though 3 and "3.0" are the same, adding the extra zero will allow you to divide 4 into the 3.0.
 When you do long division, you can pretend that the decimal points don't exist and act like you're just dividing 4 into 30, for now. Here is how you do it:


First, divide "4" into 3.0, which you can think of as 30. The closest you can get is 4 x 7, or 28, which will give you a remainder of 2. So, write a 7 after the "0." above the division bracket and "28" below the "3.0" under the division bracket. Under that, write 2, your remainder, or what you have left when you subtract 28 from 30.
Next, add another "0" to the "3.0" so you have "3.00", or what you can think of as "300," under the division bracket. This will allow you to drop down another 0 to the right of the "2" so you can divide "4" into "20."
Divide "4" into "20" to get 5. Write the "5" to the right of the "0.7" above the division bracket, so you have "0.75" written there.
 You'll find that "3" divided by "4" will give you ".75". Write down this answer and you're all done.

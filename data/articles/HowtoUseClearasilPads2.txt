Every person's skin may react to the pads differently, so after the initial application observe the effect of the product on your skin.
If you donâ€™t notice any dryness or irritation, then you can increase to using the pads 2 or 3 times per day.
 Clearasil pads are for external use only. Avoid allowing the pads to come in contact with the eyes. If the medications happens to get into into your eye, rinse it thoroughly with running water.
 It is advisable to use only one topical acne medication. If you are using Clearasil pads at the same time as other anti-acne medications, you may experience negative side effects. Your skin might become excessively dry and irritated.
 If using Clearasil makes your acne worse or irritates your skin, you should stop using it immediately and consult your doctor. They may be able to recommend a more gentle alternative, especially if you have sensitive skin.
 Clearasil Pads should be stored at room temperature, away from direct sunlight. A bathroom cabinet or a drawer beside your bed is perfect.

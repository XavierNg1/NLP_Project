 To make these beaded earrings you will need: two headpins, a round-nosed pliers, two French hook earwires and a selection of beads - they can be pearl, crystal, plastic or glass - it's a matter of personal preference.;
, How many you fit on each headpin will depend on how large the beads are and how long you want your earrings to be. Experiment with different colors and bead sizes to find a style you like.
 To shorten the length of the earring, use your pliers to cut the end of the headpin. Just make sure to leave a centimeter between the last bead and the end of the wire.
 Take your round-nosed pliers and use it to curl the top of the headpin, until it forms a complete loop.
 Take one of the French hook earwires and use your pliers to open the hook on the end. Slip the open hook through the loop you made on the end of the headpin.
 Close the open hook using your pliers. Make it nice and tight so the earrings won't fall apart.
 Enjoy your new earrings!

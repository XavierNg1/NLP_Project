 This helps everybody know you, because they'll introduce you to their friends, and it snowballs into a big jumble of friends (which is great!).
 Speak with everybody you've met when you see them (only when they're unoccupied), and help them out (i.e. help carry their history project). When you think you have an established friendship, friend them on facebook or get their skype. Offering to put their number in your cell phone is great too. This is also perfect to let people know you're in the loop!

, Just don't overdo the statuses, or seem like a stalker (poking people a lot is really awkward sometimes). If you don't have a facebook, ask for one! If your parents have facebook promise to friend mom/dad/both. Listen to their posting/commenting rules.
 If somebody says something rude about you, just say, "whatever, if you think so," without care and then walk away. You'll become less of a target. Also, the number one rule is to never spread gossip! It's lying, and you'll lose lots of friends. Just stick to being the kind kid you are.

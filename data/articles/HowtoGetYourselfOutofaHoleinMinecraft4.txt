 This method is very risky because you could fall down at any given moment. You need a pickaxe or a spade, again, if you don't have them it's possible, but it's very difficult. You also need the blocks that you harvested during the dig down to the bottom.
 Make sure there is one step, or a bottom block. Jump into it.
 Carefully jump into it.
 This is where it gets tricky. You need a lot of accuracy for the next few minutes as you journey to the top. You'll notice that, as you go to make the crevice in the opposite wall again, there is no floor in the crevice because you deleted it while making the first crevice. Carefully make the three block high crevice directly opposite, but just a little bit higher than your crevice. Then, make a bridge to the crevice using your blocks. If you have a low amount of blocks and you need to save them, make a floor for the opposite crevice and carefully jump into it.
 That is why you have to be very careful.

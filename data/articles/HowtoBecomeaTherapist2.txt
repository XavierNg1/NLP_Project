 Apply to graduate programs that will prepare you for the career you have chosen. Complete either a master's or PhD program.


Most programs will include classroom work, research, fieldwork and supervised psychotherapy.
Keep your career goals in mind as you pursue your degree. Choose classes that will help you learn as much as possible about the type of therapy in which you plan to specialize.
 The requirements for clinical experience vary according to the degree you obtain, but in most cases two years of experience working as a therapist in a clinic or private practice is mandatory before you can become a licensed.


The experience must be at a postgraduate level and take place under a licensed therapist's supervision.
Clinical requirements are much more rigorous for people pursuing psychology and psychiatry.
 Most states require that therapists pass a licensing exam in addition to obtaining a master's degree and at least two years of clinical experience.


Research the exam requirements in your state in order to prepare for the exam and pass it.
Renew your license every year according to the laws of your state.

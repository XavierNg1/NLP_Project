 Brush downwards until it has no tangles.
 Bring the hair to the back so that none is hanging over your shoulders. Gather it to the side you want the bun to be.
 Wrap so that it is not falling apart, but is still bigger than the size it would be if it were twisted tightly.
 Do not use hair ties, as they slip off too easily.
 You are all done!

, A good place to start would be shooting games or RPGs. Try Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days or Call of Duty. Other good games would be Spectrobes, Guitar Hero, or Time Hollow.
 Also, make sure they're aren't too dark. If you wear glasses, get polarized glasses or get Transitions and be in the sun a while before anyone looks at you. Good sunglasses would be HD vision ultras.
 They come in colors, such as pink or green. You can buy them at RadioShack and probably other stores infested with technology.
 A good skin would be Sonic: the Dark Brotherhood or Transformers. Also, at Kmart, I saw these things that looked like very small Flatheads. They could be stuck onto consoles and such, could be reused, and came in different themes, such as Zelda or Mario. Try to find them.
 The lime green DS that you could get in a package with Personal Trainer: Cooking works, especially against people who are new to the DS world.
 It's logical that people would prefer a giant, cool-colored DSi XL with Internet browser, a camera, 3 preloaded games, and the ability to get free game with Nintendo points than a small, dull, normal, and old DS.

, Also, try not to call out things as you're winning or losing, such as, "Yes! Next Level!", "Darn, I've lost a life!", or "In your face, Xion!". People find this awkward and annoying, plus uncool.
 For GBA games, use the same method for the DS games.

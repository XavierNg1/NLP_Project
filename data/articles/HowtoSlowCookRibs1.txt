Grilled ribs need to be cooked low and slow. If using a gas grill, place the ribs on the grill, turn the heat down to low, and cook them covered for 30 minutes without looking at them. Then turn them over, and continue to cook for another 90 minutes, turning them every 30 minutes. If using charcoal, place the ribs over indirect heat and turn them every 30 minutes.



If you like your ribs saucy, apply the sauce on 1 side of the ribs and turn it over, sauce side down and cook for 10 minutes. Sauce the other side and turn it sauce side down and cook for an additional 10 minutes. Then serve.

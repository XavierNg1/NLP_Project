 The cooked jelly is very hot, so be careful as you lower it into the jars. Fill each one to about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) below the rim, then place the seal and lids on the jars.
 Let them sit for a few moments until you hear the lids pop, which indicates that the seals have been activated.


If you're planning on eating the jelly within the next few days, it's not necessary to seal the jars.
You can also preserve quince jelly by melting paraffin wax and pouring it into the hot jelly after you ladle it into jars. The wax will rise to the top of the jelly and form a seal.,

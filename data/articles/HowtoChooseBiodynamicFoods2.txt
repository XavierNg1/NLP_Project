 If you and a significant number of other people in your community want more biodynamic food at your local grocery store, talk with your grocery store Produce Manager. Let them know that you, and other customers, would prefer to see more biodynamic items in the store.


You might say something like, "Excuse me, but my friends and I have been hearing a lot about biodynamic food lately. We'd like to buy more of it, but there aren't many of thee products in your store. Is there any way we could encourage you to stock biodynamic, or is there someone we could talk to in this regard?"
If the Produce Manager doesn't make any changes after your casual conversation, you can get your friends who are interested in biodynamic products to sign an official petition. Then, submit this to the General Manager., If you plan on driving to a biodynamic provider, the gas cost can add a considerable expense. Since biodynamic farms are still less common than traditional ones, you may have to travel quite a ways to reach one. Cut down on gas costs when driving by:


Carpooling with friends and others who want to buy biodynamic goods.
Taking turns driving with others interested in buying biodynamic.
Avoiding peak traffic times, especially stop-and-go traffic., Especially if you end up ordering biodynamic items in bulk, it may help to split this cost among several people. Talk to local friends, family, and neighbors to see if they'd be interested in splitting bulk orders with you in a community biodynamic food co-op.A thriving co-op might give you more bargaining power when trying to get local grocery stores to sell biodynamic products.
As your co-op grows, it might turn into a self-sustaining community provider of biodynamic goods. Many successful local co-ops eventually open a physical location.

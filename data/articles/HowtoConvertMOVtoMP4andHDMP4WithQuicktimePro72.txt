 It is no longer possible to activate QuickTime Pro from within the QuickTime Player included in macOS. You'll need to download the older version of QuickTime 7 and then enter your Pro registration key to activate Pro features.


Download QuickTime 7 from Apple and install it. You can download it here.
Open the Utilities folder and launch QuickTime Player 7.
Click the "QuickTime Player 7" menu and select "Registration."
Enter your Pro registration key to unlock the Pro features.
 Since the MOV file will default to open in QuickTime Player X, you'll need to right-click it, select "Open With," and then select QuickTime 7 Pro.
 This function requires a registered version of QuickTime Pro.
 This will allow you to save the video in MP4 format.
 The file will export to MP4, which may take a few minutes for larger movies.

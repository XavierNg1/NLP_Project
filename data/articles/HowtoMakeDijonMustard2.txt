 Place all the ingredients into it and stir well to combine. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap (or a well-fitting lid) and let it sit at room temperature for 2 days. Think of it as a weekend project.

This is a mandatory step before you can blend and serve the mustard. The ingredients must interact to draw out all the quintessential "dijon" flavors.
 Transfer the mustard mixture from the bowl to the blender. Blend until the desired consistency is reached -- this should take about 30 seconds for a coarse texture.

Keep in mind that itâ€™s not possible for this mustard to reach a smooth consistency. Don't spend your afternoon blending.
 Cover and refrigerate it for up to 3 months. A little time (but not a lot) aids in aging the flavor as well.

Allyl isothiocyanate, the oil in mustard seeds that gives pungency and heat, tends to dissipate over time. So know the longer it sits in the refrigerator uneaten, the milder it will become.

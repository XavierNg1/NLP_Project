 If necessary, trim the foam with a knife or scissors so that it matches the contours of the container.
 The top of the clothing flower should be facing upward.
 Place shorter pieces around the edge and taller pieces toward the center.
 Push the floristâ€™s sticks that are attached to the baby clothing into the foam. Fill in any gaps where you have no foliage so that the foam is not visible when you present the gift.
 Choose a wired decorative ribbon for the most elegant appearance.

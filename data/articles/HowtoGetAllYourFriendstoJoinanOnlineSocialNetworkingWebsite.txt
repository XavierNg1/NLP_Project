 List all of your friends whom you would like to join the website. It doesn't have to be a fancy list, just write down the names (first and last) of the friends you would like to see on the website.;
, There is a wide option of social networking websites on the internet. Popular choices include Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter. Ask around your school, neighborhood, or youth group for recommendations. Once you have decided, set up an account on the website if you do not already have one.
 Send out an e-mail, or ask them personally, and invite all of your friends on your list to join the website. Be sure to tell them about how fun it will be when you can all go online together and talk, without a costly telephone bill, as well as share photos and take fun quizzes or play games. Also make sure that you tell your friends about any membership fees or other "cons" about the website.
 Send friend requests to all of your friends. Make sure that everyone has added each other, and do not exclude anyone.
 Once everyone has been added, you can now share photos, chat online, and enjoy the website with your friends!

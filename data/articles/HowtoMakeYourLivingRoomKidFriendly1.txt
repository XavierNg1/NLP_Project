 Gloss and semi-gloss are your best bets when it comes to cleaning up after kids. These paints wipe more easily than matte finishes. However, if you must have matte, pick one of the new paints that are made for easier cleanup, called "washable" mattes., Leather is a good option for kids, as it is sturdy and it makes for easy cleanup. You can also use slip covers, so you can take them off and wash them as needed. You can also opt for heavy duty upholstery fabric meant for places like hotels, which are designed to stand up to wear., When choosing flooring, pick ones that are easy to clean. Laminate is a good option, as is tile or wood. Carpet is harder to clean because of spills. However, you can choose carpet tiles, so that you can get rid of tiles that become too stained., Darker fabrics tend to show fewer stains than lighter fabrics, so pick a darker tone if possible. Nonetheless, if you go the slipcover route, you could also choose white slipcovers, as you can bleach them to remove stains.Another good option for fabric is choosing fabrics with patterns, as stains don't show as much on these fabrics.


Another option is treating your fabric with a stain repellent, such as Scotchgard. You can also choose fabrics that are created to be stain-resistant and easy to clean, such as microfiber.

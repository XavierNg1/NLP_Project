 If you want to seem good at something, it pays to be good at something you enjoy! Explore your interests and pick a few activities or perhaps academic subjects that intrigue you. For example, you might decide to be a figure skater who likes chemistry. Alternatively, you might be a badminton player who likes visual art.


You probably know whether you tend to focus on one activity or participate in many.Always aim for balance when seeking activities to master.
 Part of “seeming good” at something comes from diligence. Show up to practices on time. Complete your homework before it’s due. Don’t be over-stressed and try not to be the best at so many things that you are overwhelmed.


Plan out practice times. For example, if you’re a skater, you could practice on three different days. In addition to training with your coach, buy private ice time in advance or find a group with whom you can split costs.
 Depending on what activities you choose, being “good” doesn’t happen immediately. You will need to put in practice time or study. You will have to give it your all. Many people can become good at something through effort.


Finding practice partners or study buddies can help make your improvement more fun.
Don’t feel discouraged if even with much practice, you are not particularly talented in one field. Effort matters as much as talent!

, Whichever subject you want to master, read blogs or online articles about that theme. See what innovations are happening. Know who the major stars are of your sport. Being able to converse with other interested people about your field will show your competence.

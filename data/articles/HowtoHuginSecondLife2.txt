, Search for "Hug HUD". You will find free versions and ones that you pay for.
 If it is a free item, you will have to scroll through a list of advertised items and click "proceed to checkout", at the bottom of the page.
 It will then appear on your screen, as if it were part of the UI.
 From there, instructions vary, but often include clicking a button on the HUD that lists the name of an animation, then selecting a partner. In most cases, your partner in the hug will need to answer "yes" to a pop-up dialog which requests permission for you to hug them.
 Rinse and repeat.

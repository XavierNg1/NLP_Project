 Whatever you feel highlights your best features, be it a little mascara, some lipgloss, or a bit of blush. Don't overdo it - you want him to see you, not what you're wearing. Or rock the natural look.
 You want your hair to be soft and flowing, not stiff and full of hair product. It doesn't have to be fancy, just make sure to brush it so you (or he) can get your fingers through it and it's not in your face.
 Choose an outfit that is sexy but not too revealing. You want to be comfortable and not concerned about your skirt riding up or your shirt falling down.
 Put on a pair of earrings or paint your nails if this makes you feel good. Don't do anything that you wouldn't normally be comfortable with, and avoid jewelry that is too large or heavy or extreme polish colors.
 Is there food in your teeth? Do you feel well? You don't want to be distracted or cranky if your mind is on something else or you're tired, so make sure you're in the mood.

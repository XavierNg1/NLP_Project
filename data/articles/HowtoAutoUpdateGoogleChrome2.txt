 Look for the Settings app, the one with the gear app icon, and tap it to launch it.
 Scroll down the Settings menu until you find “iTunes & App Store.” Tap on it.
 Scroll to the very end of the iTunes & App Store screen, and you’ll see the Automatic Downloads section.
 Under the Automatic Downloads section, tap the white oval next to “Updates.” The white oval will have a green portion. All your apps installed on your iOS mobile device, including the Chrome app, will now automatically update whenever updates are available. Of course, you need to be connected to the Internet for this to happen.

 Everybody has their opinion and interpretation of how to be proud of being a Christian. Before you get into details, remember these key points:


Pray to have the strength and guidance.
Study the scriptures regularly and thoroughly.
Keep in mind that you are blessed for acting like you should.
Keep The Spirit(Holy Ghost) with you.;
, The last thing you want to do is fall into the misconception that you are the only Christian on Earth. In fact, 83 percent of Americans claim to be Christians (43 percent claimed in 2007, and only 32% actually attended church). Don't feel like a persecuted minority, because you certainly aren't.
 Go to services often. Get involved with the youth group if you're a teenager. Organize or attend a Bible study. Start a Christian book club. The idea behind all these things is to put you together with other like-minded individuals. Building your friendships from your church will remove any doubt from your mind that you are on your Christian journey alone.
 Understand the sacrifices which have been made to keep Christianity alive. Be proud to be part of the institution which Christ himself founded, and which men and women over the years have shed their blood to protect.
 Why? It will build your faith! Jesus knows that your walk as Christian will not be easy, but He has let us know that He is with us. Matthew 5:11-12 says: "'Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.'"

, Prayer, your hot line to God, is the best way to stay intimate with your Creator. The better you know God, the more proud you will be that you are among His follower. Group prayer is helpful as well. Once again, building a community of faith is invaluable in building your confidence in your religion.

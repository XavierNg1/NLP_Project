 After you've trimmed lavender, you can display it in a vase or dry it for further use. To dry lavender, you have two choices: you can tie it into bunches and hang it up, or lay it out in the sun and let it dry over the course of a few days.


To hang your lavender to dry, use a rubber band to tie the stems together. Hang the lavender bunch upside-down in a cool, dry spot. Allow it to dry for a week or tow. Drying lavender this way preserves its color and scent.
To dry your lavender in the sun, lay it flat on a screen, and set the screen in a sunny spot. The lavender will dry over the course of 5 days or so. Lavender dried in the sun tends to fade to a lighter color.
 Lavender's relaxing yet stimulating scent makes it a popular ingredient in lotions, soaps and deodorants of all kinds. Remove the dried buds from the lavender stalks and use them to create essential oil, sprinkle them into homemade soap, or mix them with rose petals and other dried flowers to create potpourri.
 Lavender is an edible herb that tastes delicious in both sweet and savory dishes. Flavor yellow cake with a teaspoon of ground lavender, or add lavender buds to the pot when you're making roast beef. Lavender also makes an excellent herbal tea.

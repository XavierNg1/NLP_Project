 You’ll see the green “mobile top up” logo on the ATM that supports this kind of service.
 Do this just like you’d normally do when making withdrawals.
 Select “Other Transactions” from the ATM’s main menu and choose “Top-Up” from the list of options.
 Choose the denomination you like to top-up and enter the mobile number of the phone you’re going to load the value to.
 When you’re done, press “OK” to continue with the transaction.
 Depending on your carrier, you may have to call a certain number to check for airtime balance or send a text message to a certain number.

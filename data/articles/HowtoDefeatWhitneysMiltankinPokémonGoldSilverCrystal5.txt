,, By the time Clefairy is KO'd, Rollout should have already gone for 3 or 4 turns, making it very powerful. When Miltank comes out, it'll be hit by Rollout, and (depending on your level) should do a good amount of damage against it, if not a one-hit KO. If it misses at any point, you get flinched by Miltank's Stomp attack, or your Pok√©mon is immobilized by love through Attract, though, Rollout will end, making this strategy dependent on luck.

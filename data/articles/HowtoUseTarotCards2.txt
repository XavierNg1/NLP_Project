 Take a deep breath and clear your mind. Center yourself in this time and moment.


Imagine you are inhaling all the answers of the world. Exhale all your thoughts and find calm.
Exhale, releasing your thoughts out through your ears. Repeat until you are ready to begin.
 Open yourself up to receiving your answer. Simply let a question from your heart arise. Just think about it, there is no need to say it aloud unless you want to.
 After holding the cards in your hand for a few seconds and directing your energy toward them, shuffle the deck. You can either do this as you would traditional playing cards or by doing a series of cuts of the deck, whichever you prefer.
 Hold the card you chose in your hand. Focus on its image and message. Open yourself to the possibilities of it's guidance.


While some people see the cards they draw as a sign of things to come, others use them to work on aspects of themselves. Whether you believe that the cards can tell you the future or if you just want to use them to help you through some self discovery, tarot cards can be of great use.
 Let the actual card just sit on the table. Then, when you are ready, flip the card back over in your mind and let it go. Follow that by turning the actual card back over and then sticking it into the middle of the deck.
 Keep your eyes closed and take a few deep breathes. Allow your thoughts to move outside of yourself.

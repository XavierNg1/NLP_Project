 Bananas are packed with nutrients that diminish the look of wrinkles and help add a healthy glow to the skin.In fact, bananas are so good at protecting the skin from free radicals and delaying the aging process that many people call them “Mother Nature’s Botox.”, Be sure to get the banana as smooth as possible. Lumps will take longer to dry and will not be absorbed into the skin as well. If you want to use a food processor or a hand mixer you can, but it’s not necessary.
 Mix the honey and mashed bananas thoroughly. If you feel like the mixture is too thick, try adding a few drops of orange juice, milk, or cream. The citric acid in orange juice will also help to lighten dark pigmentation spots, and milk and cream will add extra moisture to the skin., You might want to put your hair up and wear an old shirt since applying the mask can get messy. Be sure to apply the mask using clean fingers, and massage the mask onto the skin with gentle, circular motions. You can also apply a second coat if you prefer.
 In order to let the nutrients in the mask sink into you skin for maximum effect, leave the mask on for at least 15 minutes. If you are looking for extra moisture, you can leave the mask on for up to 30 minutes.
 Using a clean washcloth or your clean hands, rinse away all of the banana mask. Make sure to get the entire mask off so it does not clog your pores. Apply moisturizer as soon as you are all rinsed off for best results!

 Some cleaning experts recommend avoiding this method for the safety of your caps. Others think it's acceptable, but acknowledge the risk of damage.Wash the hat by hand or in a washing machine instead if you notice one of these warning signs:


A cleaning tag that says "cold wash only"
Fraying stitches, tears, or other signs of damage
Wool material
A cardboard brim; these are usually only found in hats made in the 1990's or earlier.Washing sentimental hats is not recommended, since there's always some risk of damage.;
, Also called baseball hat cages or shapers, these are intended to protect the hat's shape. They will not protect your hat from heat or moisture, but they should stop severe bending. Simply open the frame, place your hat inside, and snap the frame shut around it.


Confirm that the frame is dishwasher-safe before you buy it.
This may void your dishwasher's warranty., For hygienic reasons, do not mix dishes and clothing in the same load. Place the hats on the upper rack, where heat and water pressure are usually less intense.
 Set your dishwasher to the shortest wash cycle. Never include a drying cycle, which can bend or wrinkle the hat due to intense heat.If your dishwasher has a temperature setting, choose a low-heat option.
 Adding detergent is risky, since it may alter the fabric color. Use a small amount of detergent, and avoid lemon detergent and products that contain bleach.


For added safety, rub a small amount of the detergent on a hidden corner of the hat. Wait until dry to check for color fastness.
Consider skipping detergent completely if you're just trying to get rid of mild grime. Unless you plan to eat soup out of your hat, it doesn't need to be as clean as your dishes.
 When the washing machine is finished, leave your hats to dry on a drying rack. If using a baseball cap framer, leave it on to prevent shrinking.

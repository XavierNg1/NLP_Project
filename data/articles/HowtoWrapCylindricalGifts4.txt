 This does not need to be done in any fancy way because it will be hidden in the gift bag. Essentially, you just want to cover the gift with tissue paper so that it is not visible if someone glances into the bag.
 If you are wrapping something breakable, you should add a few pieces of tissue paper to the bottom of the gift bag to provide extra cushioning. Make sure you use a gift bag that fits the size of the gift. For example, the entire gift should be able to fit in the bag.
 Depending on the gift, you can either stand the cylinder upright or lay it down along the bottom of the bag. For example, if the gift is a jar of homemade sauce, you will want to stand the gift upright in the bag so that it does not spill.


Alternatively, if you are wrapping cloths that you have rolled into the shape of a cylinder you can lie them down horizontally in the bottom of the bag.
 Simply, take a piece of tissue paper and grab it in the center. Flick your wrist while holding the paper and then smooth the paper in a downward motion using your other hand. Turn the tissue paper upwards so that the puffed up part of the paper is facing up and then place it in the bag. The pinched end of the tissue paper should be inside the bad, with the fluffed ends sticking out the top.Repeat this with three to four pieces of tissue paper.
Choose tissue paper that matches with the color of the bag. You can use one color of tissue paper or multiple colors.

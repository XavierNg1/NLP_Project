 A soft brush is good for brushing away small pieces of debris trapped inside the grooves and ridges of the unfinished wood. Use the soft brush to gently wipe away anything caught in the crevices and then vacuum it up.For best results, use a gentle flicking motion with the bristles of the brush on the surface of the wood.
A soft brush will also prevent damage to the wood because it employs a gentle touch.
Additionally, you can use a microfiber mop or broom.;
, Using a microfiber cloth to gently wipe the surface of a piece of unfinished wood is a simple and easy technique for cleaning the wood. This method is best for surface dirt that is not ingrained very deeply. Just run the microfiber cloth along the surface of the wood to pick up any excess dust and dirt.Make sure the microfiber cloth is clean ahead of time. You can wash it in the sink with soap and water (and then let it fully air dry) or you can wash it in the washing machine and toss it in the dryer before use.
 In order to keep your unfinished wood from needing more aggressive cleaning techniques, itâ€™s best to perform regular cleaning maintenance. If you let the wood remain untreated, you will eventually be forced to do more potentially damaging treatments to get the wood clean.


This means that you should dust or sweep your unfinished wood often (at least once a week), as well as wiping it down with a microfiber cloth a couple of times each month.

 Use a metal brush or fine-toothed comb. Brush with the grain of the fur. If you go against the grain, you could cause your cat great discomfort. Move gently, yet with enough force to remove loose fur.Be careful when brushing around your cat's ears. Some cats are very sensitive in this area.
Many cats love being brushed on their faces. If your cat starts to rub their cheek or mouth on the brush, don't stop them. It will help them to enjoy being groomed.
 Continue to move with the grain of your cat's fur. Brush the sides first. Using caution, gradually and slowly move toward their belly. If they let you brush their belly, continue in the direction of the hair growth. If they hiss or start to swat, stop what you're doing. Most cats are very protective of this area of their body, as it makes them feel vulnerable., Apply a small dab of water to your gloves and spread it around the palm and fingers. Pet your cat as you normally would. This will help to relax them and give their coat a glossy shine. It will also pick up any loose hairs that the comb or brush missed., Depending on how thick your cat's undercoat is, you might have to do this several times per brushing session. Quickly pull the fur out of the brush. Place the fur ball(s) to the side until you're completely finished.
 Make a note of how much shedding you see at different times of the year. Depending on the climate, your cat might need an extra brushing session on certain weeks. Stick to a regular schedule so that your cat can get used to the routine. This will also lessen the risk of hairballs.

 It's common sense that video games will have a price drop soon after it's initial release. So basically waiting for it to lower the price will save those costly extra amounts that you had to pay for. It can often drop as much as $10 per month, depending on popularity.;
, If you check out any of the used games, you'll noticed they're slightly cheaper than new copies. Though watch out, this isn't always true. Some thrift shops will give them the same price as one that is brand new.
 Since you obviously need money to buy games, you need to find a way to save enough money to buy the games you wanted.
 It's always best to do your research. Perhaps go to YouTube and look at the game videos online and see reviews. Find ways to see if this game really is good before buying, as you might regret buying it if it didn't live up to your expectations. If you want to buy this game only because you want to know what happens next, even if it has bad gameplay, don't. You can often find complete guides and walkthroughs on YouTube or other sites like it.
 You might find the same games for a much cheaper price.
 If you have a user on any online shopping sites (Amazon, EBay, etc.) you can often get games even cheaper than thrift stores.

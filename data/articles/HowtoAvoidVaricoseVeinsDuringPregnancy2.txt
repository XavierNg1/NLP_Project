, A diet high in sodium can increase swelling which will put pressure on your veins. Control swelling and prevent varicose veins by eating a diet that's low in sodium. Choose no-salt added products and swap out salt with other seasonings (like fresh herbs).If you can, eat more of your meals at home, since foods in restaurants generally have more sodium than those you prepare in your own kitchen.
 Your doctor will probably recommend that you take a daily prenatal vitamin during your pregnancy. Any prenatal you choose should contain vitamins A and C. These are important for keeping your blood vessels healthy, so they can repair any damage to the veins.You can also get these vitamins from food. For vitamin A, eat foods like sweet potato, carrots, and leafy greens. For vitamin C, good sources include oranges, red peppers, and kale.

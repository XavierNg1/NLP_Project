 This is the safest way to thaw your chicken, however it does take longer than other methods.


Place your chicken at the front of the bottom shelf while it defrosts to prevent excess juices from getting on other food in the refrigerator. If your chicken has already been unwrapped, place it in a pan or bowl so that the juices do not leak.;
, The standard rule says that 1 pound (0.453 Kg) of chicken takes 5 hours to defrost in a refrigerator.Keep in mind that thawing a whole chicken in the refrigerator can take more than 24 hours. Plan accordingly., The chicken will no longer be covered in frost and will be squishy to the touch.


Check to see if your whole chicken is defrosted by placing your hand in the major cavity of the chicken. If there are ice crystals within the chicken, it needs to be defrosted for a longer period of time.
 Chicken that has been thawed can be safely stored in the fridge for 1-2 days. Once a chicken has been thawed it should not be refrozen.


Store your thawed chicken in the coldest part of your refrigerator. This will keep your chicken bacteria-free for a longer amount of time.

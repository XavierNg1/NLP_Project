 Just run up to him/her and say hi, then ask them if they want to sit with you at lunch, or something similar. Don't flirt with him/her, though. He/she may already be in a relationship; you never know. You're aiming to get to know them as a friend, not a girl/boy friend. If you can't come up with the courage to just walk up to him then pretend you are doing something for class and you need to talk to him/her about the homework or lesson. You could try telling them you have to complete a class survey, which can be a really good way to find some information about the person, though it can be kind of risky (if they find out there is really no assignment).;
, While this may work in emergency situations (long awkward silences), it doesn't give the impression that you want to know him/her as a person. Ask questions! Get to know them! Find out if you really do like him/her after all, or if the crush is only skin-deep.
 If you don't get something, call him or text him and ask for help. This will show that you think they are intelligent. If you think you have lots of trust built up, ask them to come over to your house and explain something to you.
 Tell him/her some of your secrets, invite him/her to places (as friends), and just do things you normally do with your friends.
 You don't need to fake anything! You're just trying to get him/her as a friend.
 Buy him/her cute gifts, see his/her games (if he's/she's in sports), and just visit him/her occasionally.
 It might make him/her feel uncomfortable.
 And don't gush about feelings or problems, they'll start to think you are over-excited.

 For fishing longnose gar, you’ll want a solid rod with good strength test line. It needn’t be as strong as for alligator gar, but don’t underestimate the longnose. It is still a formidable fish.Many fishermen will recommend a 6 foot spinning rod with a good quality reel.
Use 14 to 30 pound test line. Also consider getting a superbraid, like Fireline or Cabela’s Ripcord. Not only does super braid have very little give – important for setting the hook – but it also is more difficult for the gar to snap with its sharp teeth.
 According to some fishermen, a lure made from a nylon rope is ideal for longnose gar. It is very hard from them to pull the lure free, nor can they cut the line as their teeth get entangled in the nylon.Take a 6 inch piece of 3/8th inch soft braided nylon rope. Then, using a lighter, melt one end and unravel the main braids from the other end. Leave about 1.5 inches for the lure head, and tie off the head with some unraveled strands
Take this artificial lure and tie onto your main line with a standard half-hitch or slip knot.
 Other fishermen like to use cut or live bait for longnose gar. It really is up to you. You might use a 4-6 inch minnow, for example, in which case, rig the bait through the eye on a #4 treble hook.
 Longnose gar prefer open water, so cast and gently retrieve your bait, keeping the rod held high. Watch your bobber for signs that a gar is hitting the bait.


Like an alligator gar, a longnose gar will take off as soon as it gets your bait. Let it go for at least a minute before you try to set the hook.
Wait until the fish stops to swallow the bait. Then, set the hook quickly and firmly.
Enjoy the fight! Longnose gar as known to be ferocious fighters on the line, but they usually fatigue quickly.

 Caution- do not use the air duster on areas where there is liquid ink, such as priming stations or cartridges. Also, do not expose parts of your body to the spray, as it could cause frostbite.;
, Do not spray cleaning solution directly on to or in to the printer. Foam swabs can reach difficult spots of the printer such as encoder strips and priming station wipers.
 Cellulose/polyester blend wipes have a high absorbency and create very little particle generation.

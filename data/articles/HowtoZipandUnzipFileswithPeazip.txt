 The file manager allows both to select files and folders to be archived as Zip files (or other formats), and to select archives to be unzipped. Alternatively, file selection can be performed with PeaZip system's context menu entries (not featured in PeaZip Portable version) or simply dragging and dropping files from / to the program.;
, The archive creation interface prompts by default creation of a Zip file, but the file format can be customized, as well as compression ratio (from faster to better) and other miscellaneous options, including encryption. PeaZip relies on optimized Deflate algorithm for compressing in Zip format, that usually compress 5-10% better than standard Deflate but keeping compatibility with other Zip utilities. 7Z format gives better compression ratio, but is slower than Zip. As quite unique feature for archive management software, PeaZip supports two factor authentication (password plus key file), random password generation, and features an integrated encrypted password manager. "Advanced" tab features more fine-grained options, "Console" tab transform the task in a command line i.e. for use in scripts or for study purpose, "Schedule" tab allows to transform the interactive task in a scheduled one, i.e. for setting up a backup.
 It can handle multiple archives even of mixed types at once, or selective extraction of content from a single archive. Over 170 types of archives are supported: classic ZIP files and its variants, new WinZip's ZIPX file format, RAR files, old ACE archives, Microsoft's CAB and WIM files, Apple's DMG packages, ISO and UDF disk images, and many more.

 Before you begin cleaning your granite tile, it is important to remove surface dirt. Doing this will keep any bits of grit or grout from scratching your granite, which can trap bits of dirt deep in the stone and dull its finish., If your granite is just a little dirty, first try cleaning it with warm distilled water and some mild dish soap. Dilute a few drops of the soap in a bucket of water, wringing a soft cloth to remove excess water before each wipe of the granite tile. Standing water can stain granite if left too long. Avoid soaps with lots of dyes and fragrances. Dyes can stain light colored granite.
Microfiber cloths you can buy at the hardware store specifically designed for stone are best. Don’t ever use anything abrasive such as scrubbing sponges or steel wool to clean granite. Though the stone is durable, it is vulnerable to scratching., For example, you could clean all the tiles left to right in one row before moving to the next. If your granite tiles are on the floor, be sure not to clean yourself into a corner.
 Use circular motions to dry, as if buffing a car.If you don’t have a soft cloth, you can use an old T-shirt without screen prints.

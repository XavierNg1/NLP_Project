 Pixelmon is a mod, hence you'll need the original game to launch it. Make sure the game is closed.;
, You can leave it on your desktop so you'll be able to find it easier later.
 You'll need this to get the mod working. It comes with an automatic installer. When you run the application, be sure to click on "client."


If you already have/use minecraft forge, go to your 'mod' folder and move all the mods somewhere else for the time being (for when you use Pixelmon). Then go to Part 2.
 You'll need an extractor like this in order to extract the folders from the Pixelmon.rar, so if you don’t have one, download and install Winrar.


If you don't want to use Winrar, you can use 7-zip.
, Hit enter and a window with a lot of folders will open.
,, After this, you can move on to the next part.
 Once it loads, log into the Minecraft server.
 Immediately exit the game; it’s time to install Pixelmon.



You don't actually need to extract it, just leave this window alone for now.
 You'll immediately notice that the .minecraft folder is there.
 Now go and open the Minecraft forge that you've downloaded earlier, open it and choose to install client.
 Highlight the "mod" and "database folder," copy them inside the .minecraft folder, and choose to overwrite the existing folders with the same name.
 Click "Edit Profile." Click on "Use Version" on the pop up menu. Click on the option entitled (or similar to) "release 1.7.2-Forge10.12.2.1121), then click "Save Profile."

, Start a new single-player game and create a new world. You will immediately be taken to a screen that will allow you to choose a starter Pokémon. Time to be a pixel Pokémon master!

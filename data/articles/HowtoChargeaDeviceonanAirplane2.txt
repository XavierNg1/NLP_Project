 Obviously bringing pre-charged devices will make it easier to stay entertained during the flight. However, it might also be necessary for getting on the flight in the first place. Because of concerns that bombs could be hidden in electronic devices, some security will no longer allow you on the plane with a device that will not power up on its own.


So far, this rule is only being used for select international flights, but it is unclear how this rule will be applied in the future., Most airports have some power ports and many now have specialized charging stations. However, they are often very popular and you might be competing with a horde of other people to get access to the power port.


One good way to get around the scarcity of power ports is to bring your own power strip. These allow you to turn 1 power port into 5 or 6. That way you can charge several devices at once and even make some friends at the airport!

, Power packs can cost anywhere from $20-$100. Depending on the model, they might be able to charge several devices for as long as a week. The cheaper models, however, should be sufficient to keep your devices charged on even the longest flights., If you do this, when one device runs out of power you can switch to the other one. You can even charge one while using the other.

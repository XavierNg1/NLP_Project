 When silver is exposed to air, it oxidizes. The oxidization of the silver causes the metal to tarnish and take on a black tint over time. To test the item for oxidization, you will need a white cloth. Rub a clean white cloth over the item and then examine the cloth.


If you see black marks, the item is either silver or sterling silver.
If you do not see any black marks, the item is less likely to be made from sterling silver.
 Like gold and platinum, silver is a non-ferrous metal—it is not magnetic. Run a strong magnet over your item. If the item is not attracted to the magnet, it is made out of a non-ferrous metal. To determine which type of non-ferrous metal your item contains, you may need to run additional tests.If the item sticks to the magnet, it does not contain sterling silver. More than likely, the item is made from highly polished stainless steel intended to look like pure silver., Silver has the highest thermal conductivity rate of any known metal—it conducts heat extremely fast. You can use this knowledge to determine if your item is made from silver. There are two ways to conduct the ice test.


Set your item on a flat surface. Place one ice cube on the item and another ice cube on the work surface. If they item is made from silver, the ice cube on the coin should melt much faster than the ice cube on the table.Fill a bowl with several ice cubes and an inch of water. Place your silver item and a similarly sized non-silver item into the ice water. The silver item should become cold to the touch in approximately 10 seconds. The non-silver item will not feel as cold at this time.

 There's only so much you can do on your own at home when it comes to dental hygiene. No matter how careful you are to remove plaque by brushing twice a day, flossing and using a mouth rinse, there may be areas you miss, allowing plaque to harden into tartar, which can only be removed by a dentist.A dentist will also be able determine if there are any other issues with your mouth and teeth that are likely to lead to problems down the road.
You should visit the dentist more often if you have a history of cavities, wear braces, smoke or chew tobacco, are diabetic, or have a suppressed immune system., Scaling is the removal of tartar, particularly along the gum line, which is usually done using hand instruments (scrapers) if tartar is light, or ultrasonic instruments if heavier. Planing uses similar instruments to smooth out your teeth so there are fewer surfaces for bacteria to attach to., If you have not visited the dentist for several years, plaque and tartar may have built up on your teeth to the extent that you need debridement â€“ the removal of large amounts of plaque and tartar through high-pressure water and high-frequency sound vibrations., If you have large amounts of plaque and tartar that have led to periodontal (gum) disease, your dentist can prescribe topical antibiotics or try other procedures like photodynamic therapy in order to kill the bacteria that cause plaque.

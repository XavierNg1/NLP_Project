 It is important that a gas mask is stored properly. Consult the manufacturer of your gas mask and ask how the mask should be stored. Try to store the mask in a sealed box. Place the sealed box in a cool, dry, dark place like a closet., Check the expiration dates on your filters regularly. If a filter has expired, dispose of it according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. You should also make sure you are up to date with the types of filters you might need, depending on the potential threats in your area., You should inspect your gas mask once a month to make sure the materials have not degraded. Check the seals on the gas mask and look for cracks or signs of wear. If you notice any cracks in the gas mask materials, you should have it inspected by a professional before depending on it during a disaster.

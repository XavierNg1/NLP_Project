 The example we'll use is 00101010.
 With each slot, the values are doubled. The first digit from the right has a value of 1, the second is a 2, then a 4, and so on.
 The zeros are assigned their correlating number, but those numbers are not added.









So, in this example, add 2, 8, and 32. The result is 42.

There is a 'no' on 1, a 'yes' on 2, a 'no' on 4, a 'yes' on 8, a 'no' on 16, a 'yes' on 32, a 'no' on 64 and a 'no' on 128. "Yes" means to add, "no" is to skip. You can stop at the last one-digit.
 In addition, you can convert numbers from binary to decimal or convert from decimal to binary.









In punctuation marks, the 42 equals an asterisk (*). Click here for a chart.

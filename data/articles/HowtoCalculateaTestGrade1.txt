 Figure out how many questions you answered correctly and write this number down. Then, draw a line under this number so that it is the top number of a fraction. For example, if you had 21 correct answers, write down 21/. Do not write anything under the fraction yet.


For long tests, it might be easier to subtract the number of questions you got wrong from the total number of questions on the test. For example, if you got 5 questions wrong on a 26-question test, subtract 5 from 26 (26 - 5 = 21). Then, use 21 as the top number in your fraction.
If some questions are worth more points than others, use the total number of points you earned as your top number instead. For example, if you earned 46 points out of 60 points possible, then write 46 as your top number.;
, Finish the fraction with the total number of questions or points on the test. In our example, if the test had 26 questions, then your fraction would be 21/26.


Check your fraction to make sure that it is set up correctly. Remember that the number of questions you got right or the number of points you earned should be on the top of the fraction. The total number of questions on the test or the total number of points possible should be at the bottom of the fraction.
 You can use a basic calculator to figure out your percentage grade on the test. Just divide the top number by the bottom number. For example, take 21/26 and plug it into the calculator as 21 ÷ 26. You should get the answer 0.8077.Don’t worry about the numbers past the first four digits of the answer. For example, if the answer was 0.8077777, then you can just ignore the last three sevens. They will not affect your percentage.
 You can do this with your calculator or just move the decimal point two digits to the right. The answer will be your grade as a percentage (your score out of 100). In our example, 0.8077 x 100 = 80.77. This means your test grade is 80.77%.Depending on your teacher’s grading scale, 80.77% would be a B or a B-.

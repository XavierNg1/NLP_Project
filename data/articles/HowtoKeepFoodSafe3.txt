 Though it may seem excessive, it's important to wash your hands before and after you handle food. This is especially important when you work with raw meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, or eggs.
 Clean all utensils and surfaces immediately after contact with raw meat, poultry, fish, or seafood.
 This is most effective if you use hot, soapy water in the washing machine. You should also consider soaking them in a mixture of 3/4 cup chlorine bleach to 1 gallon (3.8Â L) water.

 In official Catholic practice, and in most other denominations, sacramental objects are most commonly created by God through the church, not through laymen. Sacramental objects, also called minor sacraments in the Orthodox tradition, potentially have similar, but not identical, effects, as the sacraments, which are rites of extreme importance to the church. Even within the same denomination, experts disagree on how effective sacramentals are, but according to some theologians, a cross blessed by a priest may be able to ward off evil or forgive venial (slight) sins.Protestant denominations have fewer official sacraments, and often avoid using the term.
 An unordained person is welcome to conduct blessings, but these are pleas to God, not the ordained creation of a sacramental object. There are no guarantees that the cross will become holy, or consecrated. It may not be suitable for use in church ceremonies until it has received an official blessing by a church leader.
 The Catholic church doesn't give mandatory instructions for how to wear a small cross. Wear it as you like, but treat it with reverence. Do not wear it as a fashion statement or jewelry. Catholics are discouraged from wearing the cross in a manner that causes scandal or offense, even if you do not consider it disrespectful., A cross loses its blessing if it is sold for a profit, or if it is substantially broken. If it hasn't been broken, you may have the cross blessed a second time. If you are disposing of it instead, melt or break it into pieces to remove the appearance of a cross. You may use the melted metal for another purpose, or bury the pieces to return it to the earth.

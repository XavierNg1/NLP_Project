 The vast majority of the animals in there have no problems themselves, they unfortunately just had bad handling. Getting a rabbit from a humane society is not only cheaper but you'll feel good knowing you saved that animals life.;
, There's nothing worse than becoming devoted to your animal then having to give it away or put it up for adoption.
 Also check to make sure there eyes look bright and clear, breathing is normal sounding(No heaving or wheezing)and run your hand over its body, make sure there are no abnormal bumps or cuts on it's body.
 Now it's time for the fun(but don't go insane) part,buying toys and treats, YAY! Always invest in a quality cage, NO! Bare wire and absolutely no pine wood shavings (the fumes they emit are harmful to rabbits). Buy quality food specially formulated for rabbits, and make sure your rabbit always has clean water. Buying toys and treats is always fun for a new pet, I'd suggest buying a halter and leash(in summer months it's fun to take your rabbit outside(with your supervision, of course)they love to munch on grass.)

, Make sure there is ALWAYS clean water in the bottle and make time for your pet, throughout its whole life! Best wishes with your new family member.

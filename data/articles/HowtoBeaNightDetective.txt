 Every state and province has it's own rules about what the requirements are to become a licensed PI. For example, in Ontario, Canada you can be licensed without being employed by an agency (a truly "Private I"), but you need to be licensed if you are looking to find a job with an agency.


Depending on what state you work in, you may require a firearm for protection. Ensure that you obey all laws related to firearm ownership (and concealment / etc), as police have a 'chip on their shoulder' for PIs, and will look for your gun. They will probably not be very happy when they find it, unless you've complied with the law.;
, The principal contractor of PI services is the insurance industry- in an attempt to deduce if a claim for disability (workplace accidents are no exception) is valid.
, Take a night-school class on communications for law enforcement (read: know what the codes mean on your police scanner).
 Not like in the video games.
, You can use many means to thwart discovery by the suspect. If he comes out to your car and knocks on the window, know exactly what you are going to say.

 Jojoba oil has a “non-comedogenic” rating of 2 out of 5. This means that jojoba oil may cause acne in some people, so it is important to test jojoba oil on a small area of your face before using it.


To find out if jojoba oil will irritate your skin, try jojoba oil on a small, clear area of your cheek. Do this for three days and then stop using the jojoba oil for a week. After one week, check the area to see if there are any new blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If your skin is clear, you can try using the jojoba for longer periods.;
, Splash warm water on your face and then apply a quarter-sized amount of jojoba oil to your face using your fingertips. Use circular motions to work the jojoba oil into your skin.Do not use a washcloth. Using a washcloth or sponge can irritate the skin and cause more problems.
Do not scrub your skin. This can cause permanent scarring and the skin will take longer to heal.
 After you have finished cleansing your skin with the jojoba oil, then you will need to rinse it off. Splash warm water on your face to rinse the excess oil from your skin., After you have rinsed the excess jojoba oil from your skin, use a clean cotton towel to pat your face dry. Do not rub your skin with the towel. Just pat your face with the towel until it is dry.
 To get most benefit from using jojoba oil for acne, you will need to use it to wash your face twice per day, such as in the morning and the evening.


Wash your face after any periods of heavy sweating as well. For example, if you exercise or have been doing yard work, then you will want to wash your face again.

 You will need to download and install a free app before you can create an account without the use of a credit card.
 The app can be anything, as long as it is free. Try to find an app you'll use, since you're forced to download it. If you can't find anything, simply choose any app and delete it later.
 Tap the "Free" button at the top of the app's store page, and you will be prompted to sign in with your Apple ID.
 When prompted to sign in with your account, choose to create a new one. This will start the account creation process.
 You will need to accept the Terms and Conditions, and then you will be taken to the account creation form. See the above methods for details on filling this form out.
 In the Payment Method section, you will have the option to select "None" as your payment method. This is the only way to create an Apple ID without providing an initial credit card.


You may have to scroll down to find this method on an iPhone or iPod Touch.
 After you have filled out your forms, a verification email will be dent to the address you provided. You will need to follow the link in the email to finalize your account.

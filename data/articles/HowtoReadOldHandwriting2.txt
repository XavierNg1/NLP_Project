 In English, the letter “s” was often written as a backward “f." In the middle of some words, you may see the modern-day symbol for “f” where an “s” should be. For example, the name “Massachusetts” could be written as “Maffachufetts.”Being mindful of this common character difference can help save a lot of time and patience when reading old handwriting.
 Be aware that some letters were often interchanged in old documents and are not necessarily misspellings.


For example, in English the letter “i” was often changed to “y,” so that the word “mine” can be seen as “myne.”The letters “u” and “v” were frequently interchanged in English as well. For example, the word “ever” could be written as “euer,” or the word “unto” could be seen as “vnto.”
“J” was often interchanged in English with “i,” so that the name “James” may be appear as “Iames.”, Words in old documents were often spelled phonetically, or how they sounded in the local dialect.English spelling was not standardized until the 18th century, so understanding the context of a document may be difficult for modern-day readers. Try saying the word out loud and refer to your dictionary when you come across these spelling variations.

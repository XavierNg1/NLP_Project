 You can save a considerable amount of money simply by purchasing a Thermos and taking coffee with you, or making a pot at the office where you work. While the supposed convenience of the coffee shop is an attraction, when the length of the morning queue and the price are factored in, making your own coffee is the superior choice.A 20 oz. cup of coffee at Starbucks costs $2.55, and regular coffee is one of the cheaper items on Starbucks’ menu. If you buy one large cup of coffee at Starbucks five times a week, over the course of a year, you’ll spend more than $600 on coffee.A pound of mid-level coffee will cost about $10 per pound, and will yield between 64-36 cups of coffee, depending on strength and size of the cup.
 Unless you happen to be a body builder, there is little reason to pay for a gym membership.

It’s gambling, pure and simple, but it’s gambling with especially poor odds.For example, the odds of winning straight craps is a little under 50%. The odds of winning a lottery are rarely more than 100 million to 1. If you’re going to gamble, at least play a game you can win.

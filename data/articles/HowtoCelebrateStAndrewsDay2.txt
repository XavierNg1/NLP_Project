 St. Andrews Day is on November 30th, so make sure you have your party on that day! If there’s a Scottish pub or restaurant in your area, you can invite your friends there, or you can throw a party in your own home., The flag will be everywhere on St. Andrews Day in Scotland, so it should be a major part of your party decor! You can put up a large flag at the entrance of your home, or if you’re partying at a restaurant, you can buy smaller flags to put on the table. Blue and white decorations are a good choice too, but you can also decorate with tartan patterns., Haggis, neeps, and tatties (or sheep pudding, rutabaga, and potatoes!) are the national dish of Scotland, so make sure you serve them at your party. There is vegetarian haggis as well, and you can also serve other traditional foods like lamb or haddock, or shortbread for the kids. Adults can also enjoy the famous Scotch whiskey!, Bagpipers are always a great option for any Scottish-themed party, but you can also book traditional Scottish dancers. If hiring live entertainment isn’t in the budget, consider playing recordings of Scottish songs and poems.

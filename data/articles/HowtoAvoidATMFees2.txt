 If you want to avoid an ATM fee, ask for cash back at the register. Many grocery stores and drug stores offer cash back. Big banks usually do not charge a fee when you're getting cash back. Simply pay with your debit card and select the cash back option on the screen.One downside to cash back is that you can only withdraw so much using this method. Many stores limit cash back to $20 to $40.
 You can find creative ways to get cash in social situations. For example, if you're out to dinner or a bar with friends, offer to pay for food or a round of drinks on your card. Have your friends reimburse you with cash. This helps lessen the confusion for the waiter or bartender. It also allows you to get cash without having to go to an ATM., If you live close to your bank, you may want to make a trip and withdraw money directly from the bank instead of an ATM. If you need a lot of cash, say over $100, this may be the easiest option. If you use cash frequently, try to make a point of going to your bank once a week. Withdraw as much cash as you think you'll need. This will eliminate some of your reliance on ATMs.

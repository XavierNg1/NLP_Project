 The marlinespike hitch is generally used with a rope that is already attached to something. Though you could create the knot with a free-hanging rope, it is easier if one end is fastened down.


If you're just practicing, tape some rope to hang over the edge of a desk, or have a friend hold it up.;
, You'll need the object getting "hitched" to make a good knot. While practicing, anything roughly a half-inch thick and at least six inches long is a good start. Try out a wrench, drumstick, wooden dowel, etc.


The thickness of the rope doesn't matter., Pinch the rope with two fingers, then pull the bottom of the rope up and to the side so that you have a small, roughly 1" diameter loop at the bottom of your rope.


Where you create this loop determines where your knot will be.
Unless you're putting your hitch at the very bottom of the rope, you should still have free-hanging rope underneath your loop.
 Bisected means cut into two pieces. Flip the loop up so it lies against the remainder of the rope going upwards. Your fingers will be pinching the knot together from the bottom.


The cross-over of the rope, the part you're pinching together, must be on the bottom or the knot will fall apart.
 Take your long object and slide it into the right side of the loop, coming from the front.
 Now, come back towards your body with the hitch., You'll be going over, under, and over again to thread the hitch into your rope. This ensures it won't be going anywhere if you tug on the rope.
 Holding onto your hitch, pull the rope from below to tighten around your object You have just made your first marlinespike hitch!


Make sure your "knot," the folded over rope is underneath the hitch, not above.

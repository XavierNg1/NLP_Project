 A few outside stimuli trigger seizures in gerbils. A gerbil may experience a seizure if they experience a sudden stress or scare, if they are handled improperly, or if they are introduced into a new environment.If you have small children, teach them how to handle gerbils. Being too rough may cause the gerbil to have a seizure.
If the gerbil has inherited the seizures, they may have a seizure for no reason.
 If you are handling your gerbil and they go limp, start twitching, become rigid, or start convulsing, they are probably having a seizure. Immediately place the gerbil back into the cage. Don’t try to hold the gerbil through the seizure or try to sooth them.Move the gerbil to a dark, quiet room free from stressors or external stimuli. Don’t house your gerbil in a room that has loud pets or a lot of traffic.
Don’t change your gerbil’s living quarters too often. Keep things familiar and stress-free for them., If you have a type of gerbil that is prone to seizures, you can try to reduce the likelihood they will have seizures. During the first three weeks of life, handle the gerbil frequently. This can lead to less seizures as they mature.

 Bear in mind the following though:


Ladders can only be placed on sides of other blocks
A ladder will occupy one block from the side on which it is placed
Ladders cannot be placed on glass, ice, leaves or glowstone blocks.
Ladders will resist water and create an air pocket.
Ladders will resist lava; if used instead of glass, this can allow lava light to shine through a ceiling.

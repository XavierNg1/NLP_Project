 As you can imagine, it can be nerve-wracking for a guy to ask for your number or to ask you out, especially in middle school when girls are maturing faster than boys. If you want a guy to approach you, it’s important that you make him feel like he can. , Not only does smiling make you approachable, it also shows that you’re a happy and fun person, both of which are traits guys love to see in a girl., Confidence is so important because it means that YOU know your value; and a guy can never take that from you. So value who you are, and be don’t be afraid to be yourself., Direct eye contact is a great way to get a guy’s attention, because they can’t misread it. You want to connect with him, and you’re not afraid to show it.
 Talking to a guy in person and getting to know him a little bit before asking for his number can make things a lot easier. You’ll already be comfortable with him and you can get a sense for how he feels about you.


Compliment him. Whether it’s something he’s wearing or his eyes, a compliment tells him you’re taking notice in him.Let him do most of the talking. Ask him questions about himself. Pay attention and be genuinely interested.
If he turns the conversation to you, try to avoid going into detail and then change the subject. You can also tell him you have to go (even if you don’t). This makes you seem mysterious and leaves him wanting more (like learning those details you refused to share). It also eliminates the chances of the conversation ending awkwardly.

, Paste Special is a suite of options for formatting pasted text in your destination software. How to access these options will vary depending on the software in use.


In Microsoft Office 2007 and later this is located in Home > Paste menu (the arrow underneath the clipboard icon) > Paste Special…

In newer versions a small clipboard icon may appear at the end of the text after pasting. Formatting can be selected here after the fact.


In OpenOffice this is located in File > Edit > Paste Special.
Google Docs has a similar option located in Edit > Paste Special, but only works for copy/paste within the browser.
 Depending on the software you are using, the options will have different nomenclature. Different options will treat the pasted formatting differently.


To retain all formatting from the text, press “Keep Source Formatting” or “HTML Format”
To retain only the text formatting, but not pictures, press “Keep Text Only”.
If both documents have special formatting, like lists or tables that you want to combine, press “Merge Formatting.”

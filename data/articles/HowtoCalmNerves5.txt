 Talking about what is bothering you or causing you stress can help put the problem in perspective. Getting feedback from a friend or loved one can also normalize the issue, making you feel less alone. Be sure to choose the right person to talk to; if your stress comes from a family issue, perhaps talk to a close, trusted friend instead., Simply playing with your dog or cat can elevate levels of serotonin and dopamine—nerve chemicals that elevate mood and create feelings of euphoria. Just a few minutes petting your animal can lower your blood pressure and heart rate., If your nerves and stress are causing you anxiety or you are having trouble managing your feelings, try visiting with a counselor to talk about what’s bothering you.

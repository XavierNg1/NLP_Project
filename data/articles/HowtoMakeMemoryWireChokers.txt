 Cut a piece measuring 32-34cm (12.5" x 13.3"). The length should overlap about 2-3cm (0.78" x 1.1") when worn.;
, When designing the necklace, keep in mind the size and colors of the beads, as well as whether you want to create a patterned effect or to keep it fairly plain and simple. Other things to consider include:

If you want a pendant or for the necklace to have a central focus, you'll need to start beading from the middle. Doing so will ensure that the necklace design stays symmetrical. Leave both ends open and feed the beads on from both sides.






If you're going to use a repeated pattern, simply bend one end of the wire into a loop to prevent the beads falling off.
 Keep adding beads until you're about 1cm (0.39") from the end.


If making a symmetrical design, it's recommended that you leave 2cm (0.78") at each side to prevent the beads from falling off when finishing the necklace.
 Use round nosed or needle nosed pliers to create loops at each end of the memory wire; this prevents the beads from falling off. Cut off any excess wire and ensure that the jewellery piece is shaped as you want it. It's now ready to wear or to give to someone as a gift.

 It would be beneficial to have a good quality Dit Da Jow ointment for preparation and healing.;
, Once you can activate your hand chi you train it 5 days from 7 for 20 weeks (100 times). Use the Dit Da Jow (DDJ) before and after each exercise. If you are successful every time in activating your hands without fail, you can continue to the next step.
 Fill it with boiling water. Pour it into the container first the start your 5 step breathing preparations. When your hands are ready; execute 100 Snake Head Finger Strikes (50 each hand) 5 days from 7 for 20 weeks without fail or error before progressing onto the next level.
 Again as before, prepare your hands with the DDJ and your Hands with the Five Step breathing (FSB). Ensure that your fingernail length is less than your fingers else you will force sand in under your fingernails and it will be very painful. Your are not yet ready for this. Now PUSH your hands through the sand until all 4 fingers are fully in the sand. Again practice this until you can do this 100 time, 50 with each hand in one practice sessions. Now start increasing the speed of your pushing, gradually until it is striking speed. Take this slowly as this is the make or break phase. You may also wish to supplement this with 100 Push-ups first on your fist then on three middle fingers of each hand.
 Always stop if your hand is damaged and start from the beginning all over again!

, If you can do 100 push-ups on both hands 5 days from 7 DO NOT proceed to the next level. Again, if you can work the coarse sand as easily as with he find sand, at striking speed proceed.
 Do everything as in the previous stages!

, The training is complete when you can strike the ball-bearings without pain or injury to yourself.

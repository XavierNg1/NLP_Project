, For granular, sub-angular blocky, and angular blocky structures, it helps to remove the sample with a knife and then proceed to break up the sample gently in your fist.
 If the soil is single-grained or massive, it receives a grade of zero. If the units of structure are barely observable, a grade of one (weak) is assigned, if the units are observable without removing them from the pit, the grade is three (strong), and if neither of these are the case, the soil has a structural grade of two (moderate).
 These are the colors either lighter or darker than the soil matrix color. Describe whether they are concentrations or depletions, the degree to which they contrast with the soil matrix, and estimate their concentration for each horizon.

 If you use social media frequently, you might get birthday wishes from acquaintances, old friends, and people you don't even remember. Even your friends are probably not waiting anxiously to receive a personalized response. One message to your wall thanking everyone for the birthday wishes is common practice, and unlikely to offend anyone.Here are some example responses:


Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes! I'm having a great time!
One man. One birthday. So many great birthday messages.Â :)
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY SO I GET TO USE CAPS LOCK. Thank you for the kind thoughts everyone!

, If you want to thank people in a more visible way, take a photo of your smiling face in a party hat, a birthday cake, or another birthday symbol. Post it along with a comment thanking everyone for their birthday wishes. This shows that you put a little effort into making your thanks special, but is still fairly simple to do.
 If someone posts a long, heartfelt birthday wish over social media, reply to it in person. Post a reply at least three sentences long. You can reply directly to the comment, or in a private message. There's no need to respond with a new post on the other person's wall.


Older relatives, "low tech" people, and people who don't use social media much are all more likely to expect an individual response.
You can use the opportunity to reconnect with friends you haven't seen in a long time, even if they only posted a short message for your birthday.
 As mentioned above, there is no need to respond to every person individually. However, if you'd like to take the extra time, you could "Like" each Facebook post, or reply to any social media post with a short comment such as "Thanks for thinking of me!" or "Thanks, I appreciate it!"

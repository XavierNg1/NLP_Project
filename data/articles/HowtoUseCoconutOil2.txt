 Melting the oil also helps it to distribute more evenly into the mix of ingredients.


The exception to this rule is when you use coconut oil as a substitute for another solid fat, like shortening or butter. In these instances, you can measure it out in solid form.
 You can either melt a small portion or the whole container, as long as the container is microwave-safe.


To microwave a portion, scoop out an amount that is approximately the same amount you will need for cooking. Microwave it in 15 second intervals, stirring in between each one until it is completely melted. Measure it out in liquid form and melt additional oil if necessary.
To microwave in the jar, place the entire jar in the microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring in between each one until completely melted. Measure out what you need and allow the rest to re-solidify.
 If the container is not microwave-safe, you can still melt the entire jar by sticking it in a bowl of hot water until it liquefies. Afterward, measure out what you need and let the remainder re-solidify. Coconut oil can be safely melted many times.
 Instead of microwaving a portion of coconut oil to melt it, you can heat it in a small pot over low heat, stirring constantly, until it turns liquid. Measure out what you need and melt more oil if needed.

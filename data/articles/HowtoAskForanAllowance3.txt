 Make sure to plan the conversation that you want to have with your parents. Preparation will help you to stay organized and demonstrate that you take this talk seriously. Now is the time to gather your research, your budget, and your list of benefits. Make sure to have them with you when you talk to your parents.Try making an outline of the points you want to bring up. Don't be afraid to rely on your notes as you speech. Again, this will just show your parents that you are being thorough.
 Make sure that you catch your mom or dad at a good time. Don't interrupt if they are busy with something else. It is also a good idea to avoid trying to have this conversation as they are leaving for work, or just arriving home.Try starting the conversation by asking, "Is this a good time to talk?". If the answer is no, ask when you can have an important conversation.
 Make sure to be clear and direct. You want your parents to know what you are asking for, and why. Be specific, and include details. Give yourself time to make your case, and give your parents time to consider your request.Avoid making demands. For example, don't tell your parents that they "have" to give you an allowance.
Try to use "I" statements. This method of communication will convey that you are responsible and mature. For example, say "I have been doing my chores, and I feel that I am earning an allowance." This is more effective than "You need to give me an allowance."

, Everyone wants to be treated with respect, including your parents. Speak to them in a friendly, reasonable tone of voice. Remember, they're people, too! Acknowledge that you appreciate their time. Thank them for taking the time to listen to you.
 Being an active listener is an important part of communication. Give your parents a chance to ask questions, and carefully consider what they are saying. When they give you an answer to your questions, listen to what they are saying and try to understand their reasoning.

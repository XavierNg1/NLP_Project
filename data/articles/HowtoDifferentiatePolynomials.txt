 A variable term is any term that includes a variable and a constant term is any term that has only a number without a variable. Find the variable and constant terms in this polynomial function: y = 5x3 + 9x2 + 7x + 3









The variable terms are 5x3, 9x2, and 7x
The constant term is 3;
, Their products will form the new coefficients of the differentiated equation. Once you find their products, place the results in front of their respective variables. Here's how you do it:









5x3 = 5 x 3 = 15
9x2 = 9 x 2 = 18
7x = 7 x 1 = 7

, To do this, simply subtract 1 from each exponent in each variable term. Here's how you do it:









5x3 = 5x2

9x2 = 9x1

7x = 7

, To finish differentiating the polynomial equation, simply replace the old coefficients with their new coefficients and replace the old exponents with their values lowered by one degree. The derivative of constants is zero so you can omit 3, the constant term, from the final result.









5x3 becomes 15x2

9x2 becomes 18x
7x becomes 7
The derivative of the polynomial y = 5x3 + 9x2 + 7x + 3 is y = 15x2 + 18x + 7

, To find the value of "y" with a given "x," simply replace all of the "x"s in the equation with the given value of "x" and solve. For example, if you want to find the value of the equation at x = 2, simply plug the number 2 in place of every x in the equation. Here's how to do it:









2 --> y = 15x2 + 18x+ 7 = 15 x 22 + 18 x 2 + 7 =
y = 60 + 36 + 7 = 103
The value of the equation at x = 2 is 103.

 Medium drivers have relatively balanced stats, meaning they work well on a variety of tracks and can ride both karts and bikes. This makes Birdo versatile on a variety of tracks no matter your skill levels, but she is especially good for beginners.


Because she is medium weight, she can push around light drivers, like Baby Luigi. She will, however, still get knocked around by heavies like Bowser.
 Each driver has a series of stats that affect their driving. These stats carry over from kart to kart, no matter what you are driving. Birdo is, overall, average in most regards, but she has two distinct advantages:



Mini-Turbo: This is the boost you get after a successful drift around a corner. Birdo has one of the highest mini-turbos in the game, though not the highest.

Off-Road: Birdo will only lose a moderate amount of speed when off the track. While not as good off road as some other drivers, like Yoshi, her moderately high off-road stat means she can handle the occasional deviation off road without major repercussions., Try and maximize the bonuses given to Birdo by using cars that have high drifting potential (for her Mini-Turbo) and high off-road stats. The best types of cars for her are often the Rally cars and the Control Vehicles. Specifically, you should drive:



Best Karts: Wild Wing or Daytripper.

Best Bikes: Mach Bike or Sugarscoot.

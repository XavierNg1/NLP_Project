 If you’re making a mask for kids, a soft fabric like cotton is the best material to use. The mask will be breathable, and it will be more comfortable for little kids. It’s also a good choice if you’re making a mask for an adult but you’ll be somewhere hot, like a party.You can also use felt, although this could be hotter and more uncomfortable on the face.
 If you’re making a fabric mask, you can decorate it with fabric accents once you have the basic mask cut out. You can also add fabric to masks made from other materials to give the mask more depth and detail., Once your mask is complete, you’ll need to find a way to attach it to your face. Poke two holes in the side of the mask, and put one end of an elastic band through each hole and tie them off.Make sure you measure the elastic before you tie it off. You don’t want the mask to feel too tight or to keep falling off! Measure it by wrapping a piece around your head and making a mark where the elastic ends.

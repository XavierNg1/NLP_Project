 Linux is designed so that you can perform administrator tasks without actually logging in as the administrator, or "root", user. As such, it is highly recommended that you use the sudo command to perform actions that require root access instead of logging in as root. Since you can use sudo combined with your own user password to make root changes, you don't actually need to set a root password. If you do want to set one, read on.
 You'll be changing the password through the Terminal, which can be opened from the task bar or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
 You will be prompted for your user password.
 After entering your user password, you'll be prompted to create the new root password. You'll be prompted to enter it twice to confirm it. You won't see the password on the screen as you type it.

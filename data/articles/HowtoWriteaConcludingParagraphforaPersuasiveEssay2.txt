 When summarizing parts of your research or arguments, use parallel sentences. This writing technique uses patterns of similar words to organize thoughts or ideas and show the reader that they are similar, or equal in value. In a concluding paragraph, parallel sentences can help organize information in a way that allows you to avoid writing too much.E.g. "Regular exercise reduces stress, improves your sleep, and promotes weight loss."

, Your concluding paragraph should drive your point home in a straightforward, assertive way. Avoid too much detail in your writing (such as lengthy adjectives or descriptions), as it can be distracting. Choose the simplest manner to say what you want to communicate.For instance, instead of writing, "the traditional American Dream is not dead and gone", write, "the American Dream is not dead".
 A well-written paper does not need to use phrases like "to conclude" or "to summarize" in its conclusion. Restate your ideas in a different way, in a paragraph that can stand alone as a summary of your research. Your reader, having read the rest of your paper, will understand on their own that you are summing up the contents of your essay and presenting your conclusion.

 Traveling should be relaxing and enjoyable. If you want, it should also be full of adventures. Just make sure that your adventures come from things like climbing mountains, not staying in dubious lodgings.

Before you travel, take some time to do your research. Start by reading reviews.
Read traveler reviews of every place you plan to stay. You want to know if other people experienced big problems like the heat not working or the doors not locking.
Use a site like Trip Advisor. They post multiple reviews for every aspect of traveling., You want your vacation to be amazing. That's natural. But make sure to keep your expectations realistic.Try not to get upset if something goes wrong. For example, don't consider the whole trip ruined if one of your adventures gets rained out.
Plan to have a good time. But be ready to laugh it off if something unexpectedly goes awry.
Maybe you're traveling in New York, and the restaurant lost your reservation. That's disappointing, but it's also a great excuse to try a slice of famous NYC pizza.
 Take a true time out when you are on vacation. Try not to be tethered to your phone or laptop. Avoid the urge to check your e-mail multiple times a day.Don't check social media multiple times a day. Try to enjoy your own experiences.
Focus on being in the moment. Look around at your surroundings, and find somewhere new to explore.
Relax and enjoy. Make an effort to forget about work and responsibilities. You're on vacation!

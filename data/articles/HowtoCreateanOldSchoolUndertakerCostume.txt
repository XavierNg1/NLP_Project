,,,,, The hardcore will get themselves a pair of actual black wrestling boots. Everyone else will hit the Army surplus store and get a pair of cheap combat boots.


The kick pads are a pretty specialized item, available only in places that sell pro wrestling gear, and can get pretty expensive. A cheap alternative is to get some tall grey socks, cut the feet off so you have the tubes remaining, and wear those over your boots. Make sure the laces are the same color as the kick pads.
To make the laces over the kick pads, you must remove the laces from the boots, put on the kick pads, put holes in the kick pads where the holes for the laces are, and put the laces on it.

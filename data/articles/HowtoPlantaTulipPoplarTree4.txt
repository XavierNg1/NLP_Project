 If you decide to plant from seed, wait until October when the seeds are ripe. Dry them out for a few days on a plate or tray in your home. After they are dry, soak them overnight in lukewarm water.If you delay planting until spring, keep the seeds in the fridge over the winter in a plastic bag together with a lightly moistened mix of sand and peat.
 After you have dried them out and then soaked them, you’ll need to rough up the outer coating of the seeds to help them germinate. To do this:


You can use sandpaper or wire mesh to scratch up the outside.
You can also use a sharp knife to make a nick in the seed.
 The seed should be planted a quarter inch deep in an area of your garden that does not get the full heat of the sun at midday. Keep your seed watered until it is established, but avoid the soil becoming too wet.
 Tulip trees don’t require pruning. Young trees may be browsed by rabbits and deer so consider protecting the young plants for the first few years if these is a problem in your area.You should water young trees during dry periods until they are well-established: usually for the first 3-4 years of their life.
If your tree loses its leaves early, this indicates drought.

 This game requires two or more participants to play.
 Place each plastic 'ailment' in its corresponding hole within 'Cavity Sam'., You can test them by touching the tweezers to the metal - Sam's nose should buzz and light up., There are two sets of cards; the 'specialist' cards are distributed before play and the 'doctor' cards remain in a face down stack., Flip a coin or roll a die for a fair decision., This card determines which 'ailment' you must operate on. Each 'ailment' has its own monetary reward for a successful operation., This must be done without contacting the metal, which will set off the buzzer. For most 'ailments', this involves removing a small, white, plastic piece. However, to cure Sam's ankle problem, you must carefully stretch an elastic band over his joints.,

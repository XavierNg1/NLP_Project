 You can usually find these at craft stores. If you can only find semicircular foam balls, buy two and glue them together.


Other options include a papier mâché balloon, play dough, or even two cakes with blue and green food coloring added.;
, Draw an outline of the continents onto your ball. The easiest way to do this is to find a map of the globe online and print it out. Cut out the continents and tape them onto your globe. Draw the outlines with a pen, then take off the continents.


You might need to change the size of the printing until it looks right.
 Paint the continents with green or brown paint, except for Antarctica: Antarctica is covered with ice and snow year-round, so paint it white to distinguish it from the other continents. Paint everywhere else with blue paint to show the water. Spray paint works best on Styrofoam, but you can use any kind of paint, or even colored markers.


Work over a spread-out newspaper to protect your table or floor from dripping paint.
Paint one half, let it dry, then turn it over to paint the other half.
 Make 3D mountains out of play dough or clay, then stick them onto the model. Look at a map to figure out where the mountain ranges are. Don't make them too big, or they might fall off of your model.


You can use aluminum foil instead.
 Spice up your model with some fun toys, like miniature people, animals, or cars. Glue them onto the land using a hot glue gun.


Kids should ask an adult for help before using the glue gun.
 Clouds will make your model extra special. Stick cotton balls onto the ends of toothpicks, and fluff them up a little to make them look like clouds. Stick the other end of the toothpick into the foam so the clouds are above the surface.


Paint the toothpicks blue, green, or grey to make them blend in a little better.
 Glue the globe onto a stand or box so it doesn't roll away. If you want to hang the globe, ask an adult to help you cut a hole in the top and hang it from twine.

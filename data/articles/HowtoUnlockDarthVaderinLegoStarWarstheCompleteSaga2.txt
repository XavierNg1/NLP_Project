 It's the room with the trailers and the bonus levels.
 If you cannot find it, make sure that you completed the previous levels in story mode. If you completed those levels, then you may have to finish building the door.
 After you have completed all levels in Episode IV, you will unlock a bonus level called "A New Hope."

, You can find the door for "A New Hope" opposite of the door that leads to the main cantina. Once you beat the bonus level, Darth Vader will appear in the shop.

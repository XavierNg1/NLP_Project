 Pinning your victim is crucial to your tickling success. If your opponent has free arms and legs, he will be able to get you back in no time. You must find a way to quickly pin and trap your opponent so you can exploit your tickling skills. You can try pinning your opponent a number of ways:


Pin your opponent's arms over his head with your legs when he's laying down on his back.
Sit on your opponent's chest and pin his arms down with your hands.
Pin your opponent by sitting on his knees or grabbing his ankles when he's on his back.
Pin your opponent by sitting on his back when he's on his stomach, and pushing his arms to the ground.;
, Every person's most tickle-sensitive zones are different, so you should experiment by tickling different parts of the body to see when your opponent looks the most surprised and panicked, or when he squeals, screams, and laughs uncontrollably. If the begging, pleading, and spasmodic movements increase, you know you've found your tickle sweet spot. Here are some sure-fire tickle-prone places to try:


The feet, toes, and achilles tendons
The belly and belly button
The armpits, ribs, and sides
The knees and area right above the knees
The hands and palms
The neck and back of the neck

, If you're tickling so your opponent agrees to do something, don't stop until you get what you want. Whether you're tickling your opponent for control of the remote, a free massage, or a dinner date, don't stop until he gives in.


Don't stop just because your opponent says, "I can't breathe!" If he's laughing and can speak, then he's still breathing. But if he really can't breathe and sounds distressed and winded, then you should stop.

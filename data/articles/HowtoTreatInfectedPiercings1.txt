 Using warm water and soap, apply a washcloth to gently wash out your new piercing. Keeping dirt, grime, and bacteria away from the wound should be enough to prevent infection.


Be sure to clean the piercing after exercise, going outside, cooking, or cleaning.
Rubbing alcohol, though it kills bacteria, will dry out your skin and potentially cause an infection.;
, While you could buy saline at the piercing parlor, you can also make it at home with only 2 ingredients. Mix 1/8 tablespoon of non-iodized sea salt into a cup of distilled water and stir until it dissolves. Submerge your piercing in the saltwater, or soak a clean cotton swab in the water and apply it to the piercing for 20 minutes twice a day.
 Dirty hands are the number one cause of infection, so always wash your hands before touching or treating your piercing.
 If you have a piercing that is constantly rubbing on your clothes, wear looser clothing. This is especially true for navel, genital, nipple, or other body piercings.
 These places are hot-spots of moisture and bacteria that commonly lead to infections. Your piercing is an open wound and it will absorb bacteria much more readily then unbroken skin.
 Don’t freak out if you see redness or soreness in the first few days after a piercing. This is your body’s normal response to a puncture. Inflammation is common and can be easily treated with an ice-pack and ibuprofen. If the inflammation lasts for more than 3-5 days, however, you may be developing an infection.
 If you are draining pus or have serious pain or swelling, remove the piercing and clean the infected area off with soap and water. However, do not remove your piercing unless you have an infection, as this can make it impossible to return the jewelry without another piercing appointment.Clean your jewelry in hot, soapy water and return it if you only have light redness or swelling. This may prevent and infection from ever forming.

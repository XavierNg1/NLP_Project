 Open yourself up to the idea of making a new friend. Keeping an open mind and possessing a friendly and positive attitude will attract others to you., Start a conversation with someone you’ve been sitting next to in class all semester. Ask someone you’ve never worked with to be your partner for a class project. Say hello to the person whose locker is next to yours. Your new friend could be someone you never paid attention to before.
 Instead of focusing on what’s on your phone, tablet, or computer, focus on who is around you. Make eye contact and small talk with those around you. Simply saying hello and smiling is a good start., Choosing to take part in a new activity will open up your chances of meeting new people and people who share similar interests with you. Pick something that interests you: marine biology, art, volleyball, or debate perhaps. Sign up for the class, club, sport, or organization at the next available time.You will automatically have at least one thing in common with other members of the group.

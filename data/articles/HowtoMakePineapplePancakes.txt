 In a large bowl, pour the water or milk. Add the pancake batter and brown sugar. Use a whisk to combine the ingredients together until there are no lumps in the batter. You can make your own pancakes if you prefer.;
, The key ingredient to this recipe: The pineapple. Pour the pineapple slices in and whisk so the pineapple can envelope in. Set aside.
 Spread melted butter over a frying pan and preheat your griddle to medium heat. To test if your pan is hot enough, sprinkle a little bit of water over the frying pan. If it sizzles it's ready to be used.
 Using a ladle, scoop pancake batter onto the frying pan. Give it about two minute to cook. Avoid picking at and touching the pancake too much or you will rip it as it is delicate.
 When the sides start to brown and the top starts to bubble, gently lift the pancake slowly and then flip. Have the other side cook until the edges brown. When fully cooked, place pancake on a plate. Continue the same steps until there is no more pancake batter.
 In a medium-sized bowl, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy with an electric or hand blender. Pour the heavy cream and buttermilk. Mix again until well-combined and has a slight liquid texture. Sprinkle the salt and vanilla extract for flavor. Mix again. The results should be a slightly creamy liquid-like syrup that is white.
 Drizzle the vanilla cream syrup over the pancakes. Add extra chopped pineapple if desired. Serve on a serving plate.

 If you notice that your cat no longer wakes up and runs away when you vacuum around her, then there is a chance that she may be deaf, particularly if she always used to run away from the vacuum (or other loud gadgets).;
, Make a noise outside of your cat's visual field (so she cannot see you). One option is to bang two pan lids together. Another option is to shake the box of cat treats that your cat loves.The most important part is to stand somewhere your cat cannot see you.
You should also avoid standing in a position where the noise you make (such as banging to pots together) does not cause a breeze to rush over your cat.
 If your cat turns her hear to look towards where the noise came from, or reacts in some other ways (such as becoming startled), then you will know that your cat is not completely deaf.However, you should still take your cat to a vet, as this test cannot tell you if your cat is partially deaf, or if she is deaf in one ear.

 It now comes in a variety of colors (and patterns!) as well as the standard gray.


Duct tape has so many uses it's now available just about anywhere. Walmart has a good selection and each roll runs at about $5.00 right now.
Feel free to choose as many colors or patterns as you desire. You could also place a different color on the inside.;
, The five pieces will be the bottom, large sides and small sides of your duct tape purse.


The size of the purse is entirely up to you; just make sure the sides match up and fit with the bottom.
 Cover it fully, making sure that it is all gray (or whichever color you've chosen) by the time you're done.


To cover a corner, run over it with duct tape and cut the tape so that you form a good, neat corner.
 Once you've covered all your pieces, put everything together by placing the pieces on the bottom of the purse and taping them on.
 To do this, take two pieces of tape and cut them to the length you want. Now place them together, leaving a little space.


This space, once folded over, will keep your strap from feeling sticky. Now just tape the strap to the bottom of the bag.

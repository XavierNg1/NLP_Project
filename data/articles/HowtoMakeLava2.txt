 Combining water and oil in a bag will create a lava that is fun to squish around. It can last a long time, as long as you keep the bag sealed. Here is what you will need:

Ziploc bag (or similar re-sealable bag)
Baby oil
Glow-in-the-dark paint or fluorescent paint
Water

, How much oil you use will depend on the size of your Ziploc bag. You will need to fill the bag Â¼ to 1/3 full. Do not fill the bag all the way.

You can also use olive oil or another pale-colored oil. Baby oil, however, is clear and will allow you to see the lava's colors at their best.
 In a small cup, combine 1 part paint and 1 part hot water. Stir until everything is combined. You can use glow-in-the-dark paint or fluorescent paint.This will make your lava. You can use any color you like, but reds, oranges, yellows, and pinks will create the most realistic-looking lava.

Consider adding some glitter to make your lava sparkly.
 You will need 1 to 4 tablespoons of lava. Simply measure out the lava and add it to the bag. The lava will not mix with the oil, but form globs instead., Close the bag partway, and squeeze out as much air as possible before closing the bag the rest of the way. There should be little to no air inside the bag. Make sure that the bag is tightly sealed.

You can put clear packaging tape over the top of the bag so that it does not open.
 You can play with your lava by taking the bag into a dark room, and squishing the bag around with your fingers. The globs of paint will move around! Do not open the bag, or the lava will escape!

If you made glow-in-the-dark lava, you will need to charge your lava by leaving it in the sun or under a bright lamp for a few minutes.
If you made fluorescent lava, you will need to use a black light. Simply turn off the regular lights and switch on your black light. The fluorescent lava will then glow.

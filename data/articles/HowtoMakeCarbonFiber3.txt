 These layers of resin are intended to improve the look of the part, not the strength or functionality. Allow each layer of resin to set up before putting on the next layer. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to hours, but you will be able to tell because the resin will get tacky (sticky) when it is ready for the next coat., Once you have applied three to seven layers of resin, it is time to sand it. You should sand out any imperfections in the resin, like dust particles or uneven surfaces. Take care not to go through the resin, if you sand the fibers underneath you will destroy the part., After you have sanded the imperfections out of the resin, you can polish it. You can buy a polish appropriate for your resin at the same retailer that you purchased the resin. Apply the polish with a clean, soft rag, and wipe it off with another clean, soft rag. This will give the part a nice shine., Make sure that there are no cracks or other deformations on the part. If the part is damaged, you will have to start over and make another part. If you donâ€™t see any imperfections, you can use the part.

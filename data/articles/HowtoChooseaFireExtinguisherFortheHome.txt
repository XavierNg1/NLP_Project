 Is it going to be used in a garage, kitchen, or just a general location in the house? This will help you determine the type and size of extinguisher required.;
, In the United States, there are 5 classifications.


A - Ordinary combustibles such as paper and wood.






B - Flammable liquids and gases such as gasoline.






C - Electrical fires which includes any energized electrical objects.






D - Combustible metals such as magnesium.






K - Oils and greases found in a kitchen fire.






Many extinguishers have multiple classifications, the most common being ABC. These are rated for A, B, and C classifications though they may not be as effective at each as a more specialized extinguisher. The label should have a number indicating the rating for each classification, such as 5-A, 10-B. The higher the number, the better.
 Take into consideration where it will be stored, who will be using it, and the potential size of the fire in that location. For example you may want a larger extinguisher in a garage which contains many flammable substances, whereas a smaller one may be appropriate for use in a cooking fire. Remember that children may have difficulty using a heavier extinguisher.
 It is also important to read and understand the necessary maintenance steps for your extinguisher. Failure to maintain the extinguisher may result in it being inoperable when you need it.

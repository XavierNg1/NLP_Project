 You most likely have many people that care about you and that would do anything to keep you out of harm's way., There is a lot of good in the world that is sadly often overlooked in the news, yet it deserves recognition. Be sure to celebrate the big things, such as people building houses and shelters for homeless people, as well as small things such as people going out of their way to be kind to strangers. Light and beauty includes your hobbies, too. Focusing on hobbies can often give you a sense of hope and peace., Following negative news and stories after a tragedy will only make you feel worse and incite dark views such as "we live in a terrible world". If you wish to watch TV or follow the news, focus on only positive news stories., There are many things to be thankful for in this world. You may have a house, a computer, a car, Internet access to be reading this wikiHow article, etc. Not everyone has the same things you do, but the fact that people in the world do have them (and are trying to get them to people in need) is a prime example of the good in the world., A way to help prevent these types of tragedies from happening again is to change within yourself and to do good in the world. Vote for stricter weapon laws, speak out against racism and homophobia, accept people regardless of their status or skin color, and strive to love and help others rather than hate and harm them. You can also help people through volunteering, bringing a sense of pride and peace. A study shows that altruism makes you happy.

 Nearly any type of bean can be sprouted, but small beans are generally the healthiest choice. Many large bean varieties are more likely to develop mold upon sitting in moist conditions for prolonged periods of time.


Mung beans are the most commonly used bean for sprouting.
Adzuki beans, lentils, alfalfa seeds, fenugreek seeds, and cabbage seeds are also fairly small and easy to work with.;
, Fresh beans go bad too quickly to use. Dried beans work best when growing bean sprouts, but you should use recently dried beans for the best results. Beans that have been dried or purchased within the past year have the most sprouting potential.
 Pathogens are harmful microorganisms that can cause disease. Certified beans, or beans that you have harvested and dried yourself, are the safest to use.

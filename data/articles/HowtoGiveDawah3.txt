 One of the easiest ways to give Dawah is to spread the message through another Da'ee, especially if you are still working on acquiring knowledge.


You can also give a translated version of the Quran. The Quran is your most effective tool in telling others about Islam, as it is the most powerful book at your disposal.
Give out leaflets or brochures of upcoming conferences to people or to your local Islamic centre.
If you plan to do Dawah in public to strangers, giving material is the best way to engage others in conversation.
 Get involved in your local area by helping the old or disadvantaged, or with organizations that help with the environment, community, animals, and much more.


Engaging in charity work or sadaqah is a very important virtuous deed in Islam and shows Allah and others your faith in Islam. There are no preliminary requirements in order to give sadaqah and you can should give it freely without any limits or expect anything back.People touched by your charity work will most likely have a more open mind about you and Islam. This makes the message of Islam much easier for others to accept.
 This is especially needed if your community is lacking materials to give to members who have strayed from Islam or cannot attend meetings regularly. It will also bring you closer to others in your local community.


The Prophet Muhammad encourages that knowledge be shared and not withheld. There will be people in your community that are not willing to share the knowledge.

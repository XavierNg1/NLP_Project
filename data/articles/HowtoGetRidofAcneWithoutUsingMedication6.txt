 Dermatologists categorize acne as mild, moderate, and severe. You can treat most mild acne at home with topical remedies and lifestyle changes. If your acne is moderate to severe, you should see a doctor.Mild facial acne usually has fewer than 20 non-inflamed whiteheads or blackheads or 15–20 mildly inflamed and irritated pimples.
Moderate facial acne has between 20–100 whiteheads or blackheads, or 15–50 pimples.
Severe facial acne has more than 100 whiteheads or blackheads, more than 50 pimples, or more than five cysts (the most deeply inflamed lesions).
 If your acne persists for two to four weeks with no signs of improvement after you’ve used the methods in this article, make an appointment to see your doctor. Your doctor can recommend further treatments or refer you to a dermatologist if necessary.


For many insurance plans in the US, you must get a referral from your general practitioner to see a specialist like a dermatologist. Contact your insurance provider to determine whether this applies to you.
 Some people with sensitive skin may experience irritation from home acne treatments. If your skin becomes red, raw, or irritated, stop using your home treatments and see a doctor.

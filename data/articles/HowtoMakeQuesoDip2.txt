 This recipe makes about six cups. Here is what you will need:1/2 cup milk
2 Tbsp corn starch
1 cup prepared salsa
16 oz Velveeta cheese
3/4 cup sour cream
Large pot
Metal mixing spoon

, Combine the two ingredients in a medium saucepan, and whisk until the mixture is smooth. There should be no lumps in the mixture after you finish whisking it.You could also use chicken stock, or beer, instead of the milk, depending on the flavor you want. Milk will create the creamiest, richest flavor, beer will create a heartier flavor, and chicken stock will create a smoother dip.
 Decide the heat level you want your salsa to be, and then whisk the salsa into the saucepan until well-combined.Use a chunky salsa if you prefer a chunkier, thicker queso dip.
 Heat the saucepan over medium until the mixture reaches a simmer.Do not cover the top.
 The sour cream can be added all at once, but the cheese should be added one handful at a time, stirring well after each addition. To prevent the cheese from burning, allow each handful of cheese to melt before adding more in.Stop adding cheese once the dip reaches your desired thickness.
Feel free to add your own seasoning such as ground cumin, garlic, diced onion, or Worcestershire sauce to add more flavor.
 After the dip reaches your desired thickness, allow it to heat through for another minute or two to be sure it is fully melted together., You can serve the hot queso dip right out of the saucepan, or pour it into a serving dish.


Serve the queso dip with chips or vegetables.

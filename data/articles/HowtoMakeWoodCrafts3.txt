 Model boats are a bit tricky to shape and it's best to find individual patterns for these, depending on the type of boat you're after. A very basic one can be made from a rectangular block of wood with a dowel hole drilled in the center, a dowel inserted for the sail pole and a sail (cloth or paper) attached to the dowel pole. It's not the most elegant but it's quick and simple, and from there, you can start building more advanced versions., Wooden model houses can be made in many ways, depending on the end use. They're great for model railroads, war gaming setups, displays and doll play. Even simple square or rectangular blocks of wood can be turned into model wooden houses, using paint to add all of the interesting features.

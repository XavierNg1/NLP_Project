 You’ll pay less if you book an economy car, provided it offers enough space for you. If all small cars are being rented, companies will often give you a free upgrade., You’ll pay more if you want to add a driver. For example, Enterprise charges about $12 per day for an extra driver. Check whether the rental car company will charge extra to add your spouse, since some will waive that fee.Some memberships (such as Costco) also let you get a free additional driver.
 To rent as cheaply as possibly, you should forgo many of the extras offered by the rental company. For example, check whether you can do without the following:

GPS. Some companies will charge $15 a day. If you have a smart phone, you can use its GPS instead.
Insurance. Your primary insurance should cover you provided you aren’t renting for business purposes.Check with your insurer. Your credit card might also offer basic insurance if you use the card to book the rental.
Toll pass. You need to pay tolls. However, some rental companies include a toll pass which is often more expensive than what you can buy for yourself in a store.
 The rental car company might offer a fuel service option (also called a fuel plan). However, they can be more expensive than what you might pay at a gas station. Do your research ahead of time using GasBuddy.com.Fill up the car before returning it and avoid the fuel service charge. Make sure you have a copy of your gas station receipt.

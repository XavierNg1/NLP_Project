 Create a barrier between yourself and the rest of your household. Store everything you need for your work in your office so you can be efficient in your space. Keep everything work related out of the rest of your home to help you maintain a work-life balance.Even if you live alone, you need a space that can help you create a work-life balance.
In a busy home, find a quiet area away from household noise and distractions.
If you will meet with clients, work out of a room with a separate entry or that is very close to an outside door.
If you do work that creates a lot of noise or dust and debris, work far away from the rest of your house in a garage, an outside structure, or a place you can easily clean, like a utility room.;
, If you live in an apartment or small home without an extra room, you can still set up an efficient home office. Designate any separate space you can exclusively for work. This is better than working from your couch or bed.Carve out a workspace in your closet by removing the doors and installing a small table, chair, shelves, and good lighting.
Put a desk, chair, shelving, and light sources in a corner of your kitchen or another room in the house.
Avoid working from your bedroom to maintain the best sense of work-life balance.
 Find a space with a window if natural light is important to you. Put your office in an area of your home where the temperature will be comfortable for you all day. Find an office space with a door if you need it in order to shut yourself off from the rest of your home.

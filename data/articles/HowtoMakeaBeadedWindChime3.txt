 You can also seal it with acrylic sealer if you'd like to make it last longer.
 You can use just about any type of string you want. Yarn, fishing line, and twine will all work wellâ€”it just needs to be thin enough to fit through your beads. You can cut as many strings as you want.
 Not only will this keep the rest of the beads from sliding off, but it will also add some weight and design to your chimes.
 You can follow a specific pattern, or you can string the beads randomly. You can use the same type of bead, or you can mix-and-match glass, plastic, wood, or metal beads.
 For extra support, tie a knot at the end of each string first, just above the last bead., Slip the loose ends of the cord down through the hole and into the pot.
 If you need to, hot glue the knot to the inside of the pot. When you are done, use the loop to hang up your wind chime.


If the cord still falls through the hole: slip the cord through the pot, then through a washer, then tie the cord into a knot.

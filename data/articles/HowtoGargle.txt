 This is now your "gargling cup." While you don't have to use a special cup to put your gargling liquid in, it's often safer than drinking directly out of a bottle of mouthwash, for example, because you avoid transmitting bacteria.;
, A little bit is fine â€” better to start out with less than with too much.
 The goal is to try to get the front and sides of the mouth, areas that gargling won't get, during this first sweep.


Move your cheeks in and out, and your tongue back and forth, to swish the gargling liquid back and forth in your mouth.
Some people enjoy warming the gargling liquid up a bit before gargling. While it probably won't be pleasant if you're using mouthwash, warm water and a little bit of salt feels nice in the back of the mouth.
 Keep the small flap in the back of your throat, the epiglottis, closed so that none of the liquid gets accidentally swallowed.


This may take a bit of time to get used to, but when done correctly, the vibrations in the back of your mouth will cause the gargling liquid to move about, almost as if the liquid were boiling.
Gargling will coat the back of the mouth with whatever liquid you choose, eliminating some bacteria and soothing a sore throat.
 Continue with your oral health routine by brushing your teeth or flossing.

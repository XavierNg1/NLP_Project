 Keep up with them. People judge a lot on appearance. Dress appropriately for your age. For example, if you're 13, you probably shouldn't be wearing bunny tops and old leggings, but instead going for cool stuff that looks trendy and suits you! Be careful not to dress older than your age and show skin, as you will be judged.


To be popular you don't need to have expensive clothes. Instead, use the clothes you already have and express yourself with your own flair and style.;
, Not only will you get a nice physique to go along with your beaming personality, but you'll also have a chance to socialize and make new friends that share your same interests.
 You could try gymnastics, ballet, design or something else! Just make sure you are amazing at whatever your talent is.
 People trust you when you're smart and hardworking. Work extra hard in class and do some studying in your spare time.


Do well with your academics, and try your best on everything. If people view you as smart, you have a better chance on scoring study-sessions with the popular kids. They will also want smarter people in their groups, so it will be easier for them.
 Name-calling, jokes about religion, weight, or other touchy subjects, and bullying is a big no-no. Contrary to what television shows tell us, being rude won't make you idolized. You will only be seen as a mean person.
 Whether you help upperclassmen with their homework, or volunteer to help the nerds with their science project, befriending everyone will certainly boost your social status.
 You won't become known by hiding in a corner all day. Project yourself into the school atmosphere, and watch the popularity points add up.

 Android devices do not have the ability to resize images out the box, but there are countless apps available that can do it for you. You can find these apps in the Google Play Store, many of which are free. Some of the most popular image resizing apps include:Photo & Picture Resizer
Resize Me!
Image Shrink
Reduce Photo Size

, When you launch the app for the first time, you may be prompted to give the app access to your stored photos. This is essential so that the app can load photos stored on your device.
 Use the app to navigate to the photo that you want to resize. The process will vary depending on the app, but generally you can tap the "Select photo" button on the app's main menu to open your device's stored photos.
 After opening the image, you'll likely need to select the "Resize" tool in the app. Again, the process will vary for this depending on the app you are using.
 You'll be shown the original size in both pixels and file size. Depending on the app, you may be able to select from preset image sizes, and enter custom sizes. When entering a custom size, you can just enter one value and the other value will scale accordingly.
 Depending on the app, the resized image may be saved automatically, or you may need to manually tap the "Save" button. The original image will not be changed.
 Each app will store its resized images in a different location. Generally, you'll be able to find the pictures by opening your Pictures folder and then opening the folder named after the app. You can then share the images just like you would any other picture on your device.

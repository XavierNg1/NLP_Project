 While splurging is okay once in a while (after all, no trip plan is perfect), remember that this is supposed to be cheap travel. Don't let yourself run up a huge bill that you can't afford.
 People who live in Manhattan rarely eat in Times Square, because there are much better restaurants in the city for far cheaper. Try using a crowd-sourcing website or mobile application to find inexpensive but delicious eateries at your destination. Take a chance on that small Mexican restaurant with great reviews. It might end up being your new favorite meal.
 Don't act like a tourist, and you won't be treated like one. In addition to eating at places where people who live in the city would eat, thus avoiding overpriced tourist traps, this advice should be rule number one on your trip. While you may not notice all the money you're saving by not acting like a helpless tourist, you'd certainly notice the money you lost if you didn't follow this rule.


Unscrupulous businesses often raise prices on people they know are tourists.
Tourists are also easy marks for all sorts of shady “businesses,” such as the people who will show you to the correct train platform for a sizable “tip.”

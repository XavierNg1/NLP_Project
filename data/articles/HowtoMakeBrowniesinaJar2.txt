 Make sure you have enough ingredients for the number of jars you plan to create (to avoid having to run back and forth to the store). It's important that the ingredients are all fresh, so that the flavors are best for baking.
 Provide specific directions on how to bake these treats. The recipe card can be printed or handwritten, depending on whatever you fancy. The recipe is as follows:


Pour jar contents in large mixing bowl and add 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 2/3 cup vegetable or canola oil and 4 eggs.
Whisk ingredients together.
Pour into a greased 13 x 9 glass baking dish and bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes.
Allow to cool before slicing and serving.

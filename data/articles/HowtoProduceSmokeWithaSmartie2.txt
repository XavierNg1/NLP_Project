 Any surface that you can either dispose of or easily clean up is ideal. Whatever it is, make sure it's clean.









Don't throw away the wrapper! You'll need that later.
 Remember, this stuff is going into you, so use something that's sanitary. Place a plastic baggie over the Smarties (or place the candies into the bag) and use your shoe, a hammer, or whatever utensil you have at your disposal.









Get rid of the chunks. Those will be hazardous and might make you cough (or choke).
 This is sort of like a rolling paper. It will give structure to your wrapper and let the dust move around freely.









Though Scotch tape is okay, masking tape is better. Stay away from duct.
 Roll it back up to its original form (the tape allows it to keep its tube-like shape). Twist off one end to keep the dust from oozing out.
 Don't inhale too strongly or you'll probably just cough it up. Start with light, easy inhalations. Breathe in and try to keep the air in your mouth -- deep, diaphragmatic breaths won't get you a better product. You'll just get Smartie dust in your lungs. Can't put that on your college resume.

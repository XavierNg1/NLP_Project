 Brush your hair to rid it of any tangles. Then, pull it into a loose ponytail anywhere on your head. Secure this with a hair tie.
 Braid the ponytail down to the end of your hair. Secure the braid with another hair tie. A simple braid works best on this, but a fishtail braid can work, too.








To braid your hair, start by separating the hair into three strands. Cross the right strand over the middle strand. Pull the middle strand to the right so that it is now the right strand. Cross the left strand over the middle strand, then pull the middle strand to the left so it is now the left strand. Continue repeating this until you have braided all the way to the end.
An alternative braided bun style is to gather your hair at your neck and start a loose braid with no hair tie. When you get to the ends, secure only two of the three strands, leaving one strand free.
 Take the braid and circle around the hair tie, making the bun. Tuck the loose ends of your hair and the hair tie underneath your bun.








For the alternative style, hold the loose strand and push up the rest of the braid until it creates a messy bun., Use 4-8 bobby pins to secure the bun. You can also use another hair tie to achieve this. Wrap the hair tie around the bun until tight.









For the loose braided bun, tuck the loose strand under the bun and secure the bun with bobby pins.

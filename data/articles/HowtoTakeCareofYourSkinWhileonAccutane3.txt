 If you go out on sunny days, cover your arms with long sleeves. Wear pants, not shorts, to limit the amount of sunlight youâ€™re exposed to.
 Apply a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 or above to your face, neck, and hands before going out.Apply it to your body, too, if you absolutely cannot wear pants or long sleeved shirts. At the beach or pool, stay under a sun umbrella.
 Repeat three to four times each day or as needed. An aloe vera-based lotion can be used to relieve pain as well. If your sunburn is more serious and begins to peel, consult a dermatologist.
 It is important to protect your skin from the sun when you go outside. Always apply sunblock before sun exposure.

Also, keep in mind that Accutane may have an increased effect if used along with other drugs that cause photosensitivity. Please consult your doctor when taking other medications along with your Accutane.

 Tender, firm, crisp peppers will taste best when pickled. Peppers with discoloration or soft spots should be thrown away. Wear rubber gloves when handling peppers to prevent skin irritation or transferring hot pepper oil to your eyes.


If you handle the peppers with your bare hands, thoroughly wash your hands immediately afterward in warm, soapy water., Pickling whole small chiles is perfectly fine, but sliced chiles may be preferable if you plan on using them as a side or topping. Rinse the chiles in warm, salty water. Drain the chiles, then set them off to the side for later.


If you plan on pickling whole small chiles, use a knife or toothpick to poke a hole in each chile at its tip., Pour the white wine and apple cider vinegar into a pot. Set a burner to high and heat the mixture. As it heats, add 3 tbsp (44 ml) of sugar. Stir the mixture occasionally until it comes to a boil and the sugar is completely dissolved., Turn off the stove. Add about 3 bay leaves to the mixture. Insert the chiles into the pot. Mix all the ingredients in the pot with a wooden spoon by stirring periodically with a wooden spoon., Allow the mixture to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before transferring the chiles and pickling solution to sterilized jars. Heat from the mixture will transfer to the jars quickly, so be careful while doing this. Leave at least a half inch (1.3 cm) of space between the mixture and top of the lid.Sterilize your jars before pickling by completely immersing these in boiling water for at least 10 minutes. Use tongs to immerse and remove jars so you donâ€™t get burned. Sterilize lids similarly in water that is nearly boiling., Allow the mixture to fully cool before sealing the lids. Once lidded, store your pickled chiles in your refrigerator. Allow the chiles to pickle in your refrigerator for two weeks before eating.

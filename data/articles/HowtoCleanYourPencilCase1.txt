 Take out the materials and set them aside. Before you deep clean the pencil case, you should remove the pencil shavings and graphite dust.;
, Loose wood trimmings, eraser remnants, and graphite dust will float out. Do this near a trash can to keep this mess from spreading.


For whatever’s left behind, you can use a small, soft brush to knock it loose. For a material that might get scratched, like a plastic case, use a smooth rag or baby toothbrush.
 If you clean out the case often, chances are you won’t need to do anything further than take care of small marks. Dip one end of a cleaning cloth in warm water and possibly a small amount of detergent, then rub over the marks.


To remove stubborn marks and ink stains from plastic, glossy cases, cover the mark in rubbing alcohol. Let it sit for a few minutes, rinse the case in the warm water, then dry it with the cleaning cloth or by air.Ink stains in fabric cases may be removed by applying rubbing alcohol to the stain with a cotton ball. Rinse the case so that the alcohol is removed. If that doesn’t work, repeat the process with nail polish remover.

 Prawns need to be cooked quickly to retain their moisture and still cook all the way through, so you want good high heat. This leads to wonderfully browned, crispy skins with succulent prawn meat underneath.


Generally, leaving the skins and tails on his best for grilling. However, it is not essential.
 The baking soda alters the pH slightly, promoting caramelization.Pat the prawns dry after removing them, but don't rinse them and get rid of the baking soda.
 You can mix them with vegetables as well, threading them one after the other on your skewer. Whatever you do, thread them tightly together, with no spaces between each prawns. This helps the interiors retain moisture as the outsides brown.Soak wooden skewers in water until thoroughly soaked through. Soaking the wooden skewers ahead of time prevents them from drawing moisture out of your prawns while they cook.
 Use a brush to coat all the sides of prawns with olive oil, which helps them cook evenly. Add a dusting of garlic powder, if you love garlic, and a light sprinkling of salt.
 Press them lightly down into the grill so that the prawns are touching the hot grate.
 Remember that prawns cook quickly, and you only need the outsides to be pink to move on. With a very hot grill you should get char lines quickly, and then the prawns are ready to turn. Cook for 1-2 minutes on the opposite side before removing.
 Take the prawns, shells and tails still intact, and toss them with some olive oil or melted butter, salt, and pepper. You can then add whatever other flavors you desire:



Mexican Prawns: Lime juice, red pepper, cayenne, chipotle, chili powder, garlic powder.

Mediterranean Prawns: Lemon juice, black pepper, oregano, garlic powder, parsley.

Cajun Prawns: Salt, paprika, cayenne, thyme, red and black pepper, chili powder, onion/garlic powder.

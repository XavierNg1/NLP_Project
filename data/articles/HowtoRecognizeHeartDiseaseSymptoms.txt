 This is the most common heart disease symptom and one that is more commonly found in men. Such chest pain usually occurs when the heart muscle isnâ€™t getting as much oxygen-rich blood as it needs. It usually feels like pressure, pain, or burning in the chest. It can sometimes be confused with heartburn or indigestion. Quite often, this pain radiates into the jaw, left arm, and the left shoulder blade. Sometimes pain in the chest is caused by the intercostal nerve inflammation and not heart disease. To distinguish the two, you simply need to push on the ribs. If the pain gets more acute, heart disease is not the problem.;
, Shortness of breath is more common in women, but can also be experienced by men. Individuals who feel a shortness of breath while at rest or with minimal physical activity may be suffering from a pulmonary condition, heart failure or even a heart attack (making shortness of breath appear at the slightest physical activity all of a sudden).
 Fast or irregular heart beat can indicate arrhythmia, heart failure, or a heart attack, especially when it is accompanied by other heart disease symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and weakness.
 Nausea is a common symptom of a heart attack and heart failure. Heart failure causes abdominal swelling which affects the appetite and causes people to want to throw up.
 Weakness is a common symptom of a heart attack, especially in women. It can be felt at the time of the heart attack as well as days or weeks leading up to the attack. Fatigue may also be a symptom of heart failure.
 Unexplained sweating is often a sign of a heart attack.

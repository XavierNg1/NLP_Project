 On a cutting board, use a sharp chef's knife to cut the squash in half from top to bottom.

Remove the stem first if it is still intact.
 Place the squash halves skin side down on an ungreased baking sheet.
 Spoon the mixture into each half of the squash.
 The squash should be tender when finished.









Serve the squash warm as a sweet side dish or as dessert.

 Add water a little at a time and mix well, so that there are no lumps.
 When it splutters, add hing, pour it into the dosa batter, and mix well. Now the wheat dosa batter is ready.
 Once the tawa is heated, reduce the heat to medium, pour a ladle of batter from the outside of the tawa, then fill in bigger gaps if any. There should be small holes in the dosa., Be a little generous with oil for this dosa. Sesame seed oil are considered very healthy.

This dosa will take a little longer time to get cooked than regular dosa.
 This is so the dosa gets cooked evenly on all sides. Wait until the bottom starts browning and the corners start lifting up., Once the other side is cooked, remove the dosa from the tawa. Serve with any chutney or sambar.  Instant tomato chutney also goes well with this.

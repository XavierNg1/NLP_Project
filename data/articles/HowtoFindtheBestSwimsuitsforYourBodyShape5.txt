 Halter tops provide your large bust with the support it needs, but the deep neckline keeps you looking attractive and womanly.
 While these may provide your bust with the support it needs, they may make you look too matronly.
 All-over patterns prevent the eye from focusing on any one part of your body. As a result, your heavy bust and shoulders seem less noticeable.
 This balances out your larger chest with your slim hips.
 Racer-back straps provide more support that many other types, which may prevent your larger bust from bouncing around.
 Bathing suits that contain no underwiring may not be enough to keep your chest in check, and you may find an underwire top more comfortable and more attractive.
 These provide very little support, making you look even bustier as a result. Moreover, you are more likely to experience a wardrobe malfunction with nothing but skimpy string triangle cups to tame your bust.

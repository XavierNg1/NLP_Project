 Pick a place in a wooded area that is not traveled by many people. the less people that pass by your hidden space, the more likely your secret will stay hidden.


Follow property laws to make sure you are not trespassing on someoneâ€™s land when creating a secret space outdoors.
 In a heavily wooded area you can use branches and leaves as a natural cover to conceal a location.


Overlap branches with one another to create a natural screen.
Pile leaves and moss on the branches to further obstruct the view.
 Make your secret space harder to spot by layering camouflage netting behind your natural covering.
 If you are planning to visit your secret spot often, use a different path to reach the spot each time you visit. Taking the same path each time will create a walkway that can easily be followed by others.
 A spot that is concealed during the summer months may become exposed when the trees lose their leaves during the winter months. Make sure to visit your secret spot in the fall and adjust your coverings as necessary to keep your secret spot hidden during the winter months.

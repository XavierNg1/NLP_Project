 The wires are also unsafe as some of the dimensions are too small. It is vital that gerbil have room to dig, with a minimum of 6 inches (15.2 cm) of a good substrate such as Megazorb, Finacard, Carefresh or Bedexcel. Don't use a cage that is all plastic; these little animals will chew right through it!;
, They have a host of serious health and enrichment problems as well as being vastly too small. In addition with gerbils, you run the risk of one gerbil deciding to 'claim' a section of the cage which can lead to serious fighting, separation, declanning and even death.
 Since gerbils must be kept in pairs a good minimum for a pair is 20 gallon (75.7 L) glass tank with a wire topper. A special tank for a gerbil is called a gerbilarium. The topper means you can fill the tank section solely with substrate and the wire section allows a place for a medium sized silent spinner, hammocks and rope toys and most importantly, gives a place for water and a dust bath where it will not become contaminated or buried.
 This is important, because gerbils can jump and will leap right out of their cages if there is no lid.

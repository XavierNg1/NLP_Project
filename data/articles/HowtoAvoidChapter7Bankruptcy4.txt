 A Chapter 13 bankruptcy has many advantages over a Chapter 7 which may be attractive to you. For example, with a Chapter 13, you can do the following:


Keep your assets. The trustee won’t sell anything in a Chapter 13. Instead, you come up with a repayment plan based on your income, assets, and debt level. At the end of the repayment period (three to five years), any unpaid unsecured debts are eliminated.
Avoid foreclosure. In a Chapter 13, you can spread out your unpaid mortgage payments over the repayment plan. If you remain current on your mortgage, the bank won’t foreclose.Eliminate some extra debts. A Chapter 13 can eliminate certain debts that a Chapter 7 can’t. For example, you can discharge retirement account loans and some fines or penalties owed to the government. You can also eliminate debts incurred in a divorce decree., If you run a business, you can avoid liquidation by choosing a Chapter 11 reorganization. Under a Chapter 11, you create a repayment plan, which your creditors vote on. A Chapter 11 allows you to continue to run your business, during and after the bankruptcy.


If your business is a sole proprietorship, you can also choose a Chapter 13 to reorganize your business debts. You come up with a repayment plan.

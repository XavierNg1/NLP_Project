 Maybe you need to dispose of your tampon in a public washroom or when you are at a friend’s house for a sleepover or a hang out. You should always start by wrapping the tampon in toilet paper. This will protect your hands from getting blood on them and prevent any blood from the tampon from getting on the floor, the toilet, or all over the garbage.You may decide to wrap the tampon several times in toilet paper to protect it, especially if you are at a friend’s house and want to dispose of it discreetly.
 If you are removing the tampon in a public washroom, there is often a small metal bin beside the toilet that you can open and place the tampon in. It may be marked “tampons only” or “sanitary napkins only.”You should close the lid of the metal bin once you have deposited the tampon. Often these disposal bins are emptied by cleaning staff once a day.
 If you are at a friend’s house for a sleepover or a hang out and have to dispose of your tampon, you should place it in their garbage. Never flush it down the toilet, as this can clog the toilet.


You should avoid putting the tampon in your bag or in your pocket, even if it is wrapped in toilet paper. Tampons can have a strong smell due to the blood and menstrual material on it so you do not want to find a smelly tampon in your bag or in your pocket later.
 If you are camping or you do not have access to a proper washroom for whatever reason, you should try to wrap the tampon in toilet paper, a paper towel or a piece of paper, in a pinch. Then, you should place the tampon in a paper or plastic bag. This will ensure the tampon does not leak blood or get blood everywhere. You should then try to throw the bag away as soon as you can in a proper garbage.

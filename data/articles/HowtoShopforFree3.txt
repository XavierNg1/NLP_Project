 Find a neighborhood yard sale happening and "shop" early in the day, keeping track of the houses with the best stuff. Find out how long they'll be open and come back. Often, people tired of sitting outside and haggling over their old dinnerware all day will be in a more charitable mood. Obviously, don't assume you'll be getting anything for free, but you may be saving them a trip to Goodwill at the end of a long day. At the very least, this is a good way to get super-discounted merchandise.
 Instead of donating things to second-hand stores, some primarily upper-middle-class neighborhoods and communities have developed a vibrant "free pile" culture, in which you'll be able to find clothes, housewares, old books, and other things in boxes marked "Free" in front of the house.


If you live in a college town, keep track of moving weekend. Cruising the student neighborhoods can be a great way to find stuff like beds, bookshelves, and desks.



When a fridge breaks at the grocery store or too much day-old bread accumulates, stores tend to throw things away to avoid risking spoilage. Freegans are people who think of this as an overly cautious and wasteful practice, and choose to take the "garbage" in part as a statement of protest.
If you want to dumpster dive, be very careful about "No Trespassing" signs. Some businesses get angry about people digging around in their garbage.
 In most MoneySaver free papers and classified sections, as well as on Craigslist, there's a running page of things being given away for free. You might find free puppies one day and free firewood the next, making it a somewhat unreliable way to find anything in particular, but it's always there and good to keep abreast of.

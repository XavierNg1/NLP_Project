 Just because a dog has the Rottweiler color and a stocky build does not make it a Rottweiler. Other breeds, such as the English Mastiff, American Mastiff, Bull Mastiff, or Pit Bull can resemble a Rottweiler, and can produce offspring that may look similar to a purebred Rottweiler. Mixed breeds typically have either the conformation of a Rottweiler or the Rottweiler color, but rarely both.A mastiff mix with a Rottweiler will often have jowls or cheeks that hang below its chin when the mouth is closed, and will have excess skin and wrinkling around the face and head.
 Mixed breeds will often have a longer coat than the short hair of a purebred Rottweiler. Other mixes will produce longer hair than a purebred; one of the most common mixes is Rottweiler with German Shepherd, which sometimes results in a dog with the color and size of a Rottweiler, but the furriness and tail of a German Shepherd.A lean dog with a long, thin muzzle and Rottweiler coloring may be mixed with a Labrador Retriever or Doberman Pinscher.
 Because of their athleticism and bite strength, Rottweilers are often crossed with Pit Bulls for the purposes of dog fighting. These crosses are typically smaller than purebred Rottweilers, and have a wider, almost bulldog-like stance.


Also, a Rottweiler with a curly tail will always be a mix of some kind., In order to be certain that you have a purebred Rottweiler and not, in fact, a mixed breed dog, you should try to acquire some breed registration paperwork. Most purebred dogs have paperwork that accompanies them when they are given to their owners from the breeder.The paperwork will most likely come from the American Kennel Club (AKC) or the United Kennel Club (UKC), the two largest registration organizations in the United States for purebred dogs.

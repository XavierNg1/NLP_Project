 Clean the knife and cutting board with hot water and soap, and be sure to rinse both off thoroughly. Your vegetables don’t need to be washed with soap, but rinse with hot water and consider scrubbing with a cloth or brush.


Use a sharp, non-serrated knife for cutting. A chopping knife works well but is not required. It’s important to only use a sharp knife so you can make clean cuts.;
, Potatoes and carrots are often peeled before being julienned. It is up to you depending on how you plan to eat them. If you don’t peel your potatoes, at least make sure buds or eyes are removed from the skin.








Use a peeler or a paring knife to remove the skin.
 Cut off the stem and bottoms when necessary. Slice off one side at a time so you are left with a rectangular chunk of vegetable. You can throw the scraps away, or you can slice them up and mix them in with the uniform pieces you’ll cut later.








This is especially helpful for potatoes, zucchini, and squash.
 If you are going to be eating the pieces raw, they can be a little longer, but if you’re cooking with them, 2-3 inches is best. Each chunk does not have to be the exact same length, just divide the vegetable evenly.









The general rule for juliennes is that you’d be able to eat them in one bite, but you can cut them into longer chunks if you want.
 When cutting juliennes, ⅛ in (0.3 cm) to 1








Be careful not to cut yourself as you slice.
 Flip the slices you’ve just cut so that they are piled on top of each other. Then cut them into sticks that are ⅛ in (0.3 cm) to 1/16 in (0.15 cm) thick, again. The goal with juliennes is to get them all to a fairly uniform size.

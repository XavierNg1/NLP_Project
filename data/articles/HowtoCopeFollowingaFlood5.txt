 If the gas has been turned off at the main valve serving your home, you need to have a professional restore gas service to your home, relight pilot lights, and do a final check of the system.
 Check your oil pump. If it got wet, have the pump professionally checked and cleaned. After you've turned the electricity back on, open the main valve and turn the pump on. Look carefully for any signs of leaking oil; if you see any, call a professional.


Propane, LP gas, and butane systems are kept in pressurized tanks, so there is no electric pump to turn on, but there are check valves and emergency shut-off valves. Check the tanks for signs of movement or floating. Then follow the instructions above for gas systems.
 Many local codes require that a licensed electrician do the work, or that a municipal inspector check the system before you can turn the power back on.
 Public water suppliers usually provide water soon after the flood. If you're unsure of your water supply, only use it to hose your home or for sanitation purposes (such as flushing the toilet).


Private wells should be pumped until the water is clear. You can decide whether water is clear enough to hose your home and do other cleaning work. Check with the local health department for instructions before you drink or cook with your well water.
Check your water heater. If flood waters got into the gas burner, electrical parts, or insulation, it should be replaced. If you want to save it, have it cleaned and restarted by a professional.
Public sewers should work soon after a flood, but mud and debris might clog them. Flush the toilet before you use it. If it's clogged, check with your local sewer department. Septic systems won't work until the ground water level is below the distribution lines. So be careful about flushing the toilet and pouring things down the drain; they may not have anywhere to go.

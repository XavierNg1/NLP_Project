 Here we have 16: G T Y O R J O T E O U I A B G T

, If the square root isn't a whole number, round up). We can put 16 into 4 rows of 4 (I.e. the square root of 16 is 4). If we had 25 letters we could put them into 5 rows of 5 (square root of 25 is 5) and so on. In cases where the number doesn't divide so neatly, use the number of rows for the next "boxable" (perfect square) number up. The "boxable" (square) numbers are 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, etc. If the code has 22 letters (square root of 22 is 4.69), the next number up is 25, which would mean 5 rows (4.69 rounds up to 5).
 With the example given, it'd be written out as such:
GTYO
RJOT
EOUI
ABGT

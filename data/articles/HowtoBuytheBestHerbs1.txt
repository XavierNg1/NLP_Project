 Regardless of how you are buying herbs, it is a good idea get a small sample to help you evaluate them for quality. Buying from a local herbalist is ideal because you will be able to investigate the herbs in person. If you are buying from an online provider, then ask them to send you a sample so that you can decide if you want to purchase herbs from them.;
, Choose an herb provider that uses organic practices to grow their herbs. Herbs that are grown using conventional methods will be contaminated with pesticides and this may affect the potency and quality of the herbs.


If you are buying herbs online, look for products that are produced using organic, sustainable growing practices as well as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). GMPs are sets of rules and regulations set up by the FDA., Color may help you determine the quality of the herbs you are considering buying.Look at the herbs to see if they are green or brown. Greener herbs are fresher than brownish herbs. A green color also indicates that the herbs have not been exposed to excessive heat.


Check for signs of mold or mildew as well. Mold and mildew may be dark or greyish/whitish and may look dusty., Quality herbs should have a pleasant aroma.Smell your herbs to see if they smell how they are supposed to smell. If there is no smell, then the herbs may have been exposed to heat and this can make them less effective.


Steer clear of any herbs that do not how you expect them to smell. For example, if you buy some peppermint that does not smell minty, then it might be an inferior product or it might not be mint at all.
 Some herbs are expensive, so it is important to make sure that you are getting what you paid for. Inspect the herbs to make sure that they have not been filled with other herbs or with another part of the plant.


For example, if the herb is a flower, then only flowers should be in the bag. If the herb is a root, then you should be looking at a root.

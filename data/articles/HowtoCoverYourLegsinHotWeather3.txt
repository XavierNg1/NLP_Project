 To protect your legs from UV rays in the heat, cover them with sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. Opt for a brand that is waterproof and sweat-resistant, and reapply at least every two hours. Be sure to all parts of your legs, especially your ankles and behind your knees, where the skin is more sensitive., A spray tan can cover marks, bruises, and pronounced veins on your legs and give them your legs color. Visit a local salon that does spray tanning and ask for a lighter shade of tanner to start (you can always go darker the next time). As an alternative, purchase a self-tanner from a pharmacy or beauty supply store to use on your legs at home.Be sure to exfoliate your legs before getting a spray tan or using self-tanner, as it will allow for a more even distribution of color.
 If you are insecure about marks on your legs such as bruises, scrapes, or bumps, cover them with concealer. To cover very dark bruises, use a concealer that is two or three shades lighter than your skin tone. To cover scrapes, use a fine eyeliner brush to avoid over-applying concealer.

 Open a bottle of washable paint and stretch a balloon over the opening. Flip the balloon and the bottle upside down and give the bottle a squeeze. Don't fill the entire balloon with paint.Tempera and poster paint will work the best, but you can use acrylic too.;
, Carefully tip the bottle right-side-up. Pinch the neck of the balloon and pull it off of the bottle. Pump air into the balloon until the balloon is nice and full.


You can also blow air into the balloon if you are careful and have strong lungs.
 Pinch the end of the balloon and pull it off of the pump. Wrap the balloon's tail around your finger to make a loop, then pull the end through it to make a knot.
 Use a different color of paint for each balloon. If you want to, match the color of the balloon to the paint you are using. This way, you can tell what's inside it. Experiment with using more paint in some balloons than others.
 Put on a set of clothes you don't mind getting dirty. Find a spot outside that is easy to clean, or where paint splatters are okay. A driveway would be ideal. Wearing sunglasses or goggles would also be a good idea, in case the paint splatters., Spread out a sheet of poster paper on the ground. Arrange the balloons on the paper. Pop them by stomping on them or poking them with pins or wooden skewers.You can stomp on the balloons barefoot or with rain boots.If this is for an older child, pin the balloons through the tail to a foam core board. Prop the board up, then pop the balloons by throwing darts at them.

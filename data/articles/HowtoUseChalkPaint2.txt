 This allows the brush to pick up a good amount of paint. It also gives you a longer stroke, which means you can cover more area before you need to reload your brush., Only dip the brush about halfway in to the can; you don’t want so much paint on the brush that it drips a lot. Tap the brush against the side of the can to remove excess paint., For example, if you’ve decided to paint starting at the left of your piece, always move left to right. When you run out of paint, re-dip the brush, and then start by placing your brush just inside the paint you just applied and continue painting in the same direction.

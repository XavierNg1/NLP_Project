 If you stay this way, half of your battle is done. There will be no need to control your bladder. Always think positive thoughts and participate in relaxing events such as yoga, pilates, or stretching.;
, If you do happen to become stressed and suddenly lose control of your bladder, place your hand over the area and press hard. Also, placing your fingers over your crotch and applying pressure can help. If you are in a populated area, then squeeze your thighs together and think of anything but the bathroom.
 Learn what ticks you off and try to avoid those situations. If unavoidable, then make sure you keep your legs firmly together but don't squeeze too hard.
 Also keep your fingers pressed down on your crotch to avoid further leakage.

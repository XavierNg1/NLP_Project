 driving at night is no scarier than driving in daytime, you just have to keep your wits about you.
 You will need to be able to see where you're going, so use your main headlights, only use full beam headlights when you need to see further ahead (for example, when you are at the front of a queue of cars) and always remember to turn them off when another car is coming towards you or when someone is in front of you, full beams can dazzle other road users.
 When a car is coming towards you keep your eyes as far to the left as possible, this will prevent you from being dazzled.
 Your headlights will not illuminate too far ahead of you, so you need to be constantly aware of where you are in relation to the road markings. Look ahead for clues of upcoming obstacles for example, a car ahead braking, this could indicate a corner, or some other hazard ahead.
 This will give you more time to react should a hazard arise. Be careful not to drive too slowly as this will cause a hazard to other road users.
 try not to become distracted by things going on around you, doing so will increase your reaction time.

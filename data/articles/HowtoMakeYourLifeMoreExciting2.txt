 Summon your courage. Do something that pushes your boundaries. Try rock climbing, or go on the scariest ride at a carnival or amusement park. It can feel exciting, get your heart pumping faster, and make you feel alive again. When you step outside your comfort zone, you open a door to a new world of exciting experiences.
 You don't have to ditch your current friends, but try casting a wider net and hanging out with someone new. A co-worker, someone from the gym, or a friend-of-a-friend can introduce you to new experiences, food, music, and perspectives. You can bring some excitement to their life, too.
 Try collecting something you love. Find a club to join of people that share your interest.
 Going to school may not seem that exciting, but you could also take a cooking class, an art class, a karate class, or anything else you have a deep interest in learning. Learning new things will help keep you growing as person, even if you are older. You can often find some classes available for you to try for free at your local community center.
 Traveling somewhere new is a great way to meet new people and learn about life from a different cultural perspective. Even if you only take a short road trip to the next state it can be incredibly refreshing to discover new places that you have never seen before., Eating at a restaurant with food from another country, or just from a different part of the one you live in, can bring a whole other flavor to your palette. If don't want to spend the money to eat out, you can always look up some new recipes and try cooking them at home.
 You don't have to do this alone. If you have any friends with unexciting lives, get them to do exciting things with you. It is much more fun, and it will make these memories last twice as long.

 Striking is the art of punching and kicking your opponent. In order to compete with the strong man face to face, you’ll need to develop striking skills. Find a local gym and talk to the trainer about taking classes.


The most popular and effective striking arts include American boxing, Muay Thai Kickboxing, and Karate.
When fighting a strong man, use your speed to your advantage. Try to dodge his punches without getting hit.
Don’t think you can become efficient at striking or at any martial art, without going to an official gym. Muay Thai for example, has been developed for several hundred years and requires an immense amount of skill., Many fights end up on the ground, or in a wrestling or grappling situation. This can pose an obvious disadvantage if you are competing against someone that's strong. If you’re able to learn how to grapple however, you will have the advantage against someone who is untrained in any grappling arts.


Popular grappling arts include wrestling, Greco Roman wrestling, Judo, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.Going to the ground may even be a better situation if you can get top control or your opponent is efficient at striking.
”Rolling” or grappling practice is the best way for you to get experience. Take every opportunity to grapple with someone bigger and better than you when you attend your class.
Once you have trained and refined your technique, sparring will give you a real experience if you get into a fight.
 While they could never substitute real training and sparring, instructional videos can give you a glimpse into different ways you can protect yourself from a strong man. If you can’t afford a class, or there isn’t one in your area, this could be an alternative.


Do not rely on instructional videos before trying to beat a strong man.
Make sure to check the ratings on the instructional video before you purchase it, so you know that others have found it effective.

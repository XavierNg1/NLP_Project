 You can make it sexy by doing a smoky eye. No matter what your eye color and complexion, you can pull it off. Not all smoky eyes should be the basic black, grey, or brown. Some colors to use are: plum, olive green, navy blue, gold, silver, copper, burgundy, rosy pink, or even if you want a punk look a bright color. If you have green eyes, it's well known that a purple can make your eye colour really stand out, or technically any colour with a hint of red in it, as red is opposite to green on the colour wheel, and will be complimentary. Mossy green makes brown eyes smolder!. Blue eyes can get away will anything as most colours work. Hazel eyes look nice with a brown eyeshadow, but if you want to go on full on fierceness, go for the black, just not too heavy, that's such a turn-off. Also, it is known that eye shadow colour the same as your eye colour with enhance its colour. For example, you could use a brown eyeshadow with brown eyes, it looks gorgeous!

, The key to your make-up is not to paint a new you, but to allow a natural, intriguing invitation for the man to see you.
 They add depth.
 Just not like a fish!.
 Use a subtle bronzer or shimmer to set. Using a dusty rose blush, just smile and pop this pink colour on the apples of your cheeks. Do not smudge up the cheekbone, this is slightly old-fashioned now and if you use too much, it can make you look strange and stripy, the same goes for bronzer. Use the bronzer on the hollows of your cheeks (imagine contouring the bronzer where your cheeks are sucked in, this can make your face look slimmer). Also, if you want to lose 10 pounds, dust some bronzer on each jawline, slightly underneath. Don't go overboard and make it obvious though.

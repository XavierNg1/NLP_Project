 There are a few missions on fantage. Also, you can get a medal for playing a bunch of missions.
 If you become a reporter, you earn a medal. But you have to take a test before you can become a reporter. The requirements are to be a Premium Member or a regular member for at least 30 days, and you have to be a model citizen on Fantage. You also earn a medal if you write at least 15 short descriptions on events on Fantage. You can only write 3 a day though.

 Now that you've put all of your items in their place, you should have a bare floor. Take the time to clean it to give your room that polished feel. You won't feel organized if your room doesn't feel clean.


Put on some music or invite a friend over to help you clean to make the process more enjoyable.
If you have a hardwood floor, wash or sweep it. If you have a carpeted floor, it's time to vacuum.
 Take a wet cloth and run it over your desk, the top of your dresser, your nightstand, and any additional items in your room. Get rid of all of the dust that you've ignored while your room was too messy.


Make a goal of wiping the surfaces in your room at least once a week.
 You don't want all the hard work you put into cleaning and organizing your room to go to waste. If you go back to your messy habits in just one week, you can undo so much of the effort that you've put in. Here's how to make sure you maintain a clean and organized room in the future:


Be determined to spend at least 5 to 10 minutes every night organizing your room before you go to bed. Now that you've organized the last of your things, you should vow to keep them in their places.
Be determined to clean your room for at least 5 to 10 minutes every day. This includes taking out the trash, getting rid of any food, and removing any old papers, ticket stubs, or random things that have accumulated in your space.

 Are you planning a summer trip to Paris? Are you doing humanitarian work in Algeria? Are you trying to impress a friend from Belgium? Whatever your reason for learning French quickly, stay motivated by writing your purpose down in the front cover of the notebook you use during your French study sessions.
 Focus on the most useful phrases and words pertaining to your situation and goals.
 The sticky note should have the name of the objects written on it.For instance, you might write the word “frigo” on a sticky note and stick it on the fridge. That way, every time you go to open your fridge, or even just walk past it, you’ll see the word and make the association in your head that “frigo” means fridge.
 Because of grammatical differences between French and English, you might get confused if you try to translate directly between the two languages. Instead, learn whole phrases and use imagery to remember them. For instance, you might remember the French phrase “Je t'aime,” (“I love you”) with a mental image of two people kissing.
 Even if you aren’t speaking French out loud, say the French word for everything you see and touch in your head. When you think, do it in French.Try to incorporate simple French words or phrases into conversation with your close friends and family -- for instance, you might answer a friend’s question with a simple “Oui” or “Bien.”

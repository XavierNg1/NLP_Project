 At this time, you can also lightly grease your casserole dish, so that it will be ready for you.
 You can use leftover rice, or you can make it fresh. If you want to make the rice fresh, do the following:


Fill a saucepan with ½ cup (115 grams) of dry rice (preferably medium-grain) and 1 cup (240 milliliters).
Bring the water and rice to a boil over medium-high heat.
Cover the saucepan, and reduce the heat to low.
Allow the rice to simmer over low heat for 15 minutes.
Fluff the rice with a fork. Leave it in the saucepan.
 Crack the eggs directly into the casserole dish, then add the coconut milk. Mix the two together with a whisk until the yolks break. Keep whisking until everything is evenly blended and no streaks remain.
 If you'd like to add a more exotic flavor and texture to the rice pudding, add ½ cup (30 grams) of shredded coconut.
 Don't worry if the mixture looks soggy and soupy. The rice will soak up the liquid as it bakes, and the eggs will give you a custard-like texture.
 Place the casserole dish into a larger baking dish, such as a baking pan or a roasting pan. Fill the larger dish with 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of water., Carefully place both baking dishes into the oven, and let the rice pudding bake for 30 minutes. Open the oven door and give the mixture a stir, then bake it for another 20 minutes or so, or until the pudding turns firm., It will taste great while it is still hot, but you can also serve it cold. To do this, let it cool down to room temperature first, then let it finish chilling in the fridge. Press a sheet of plastic wrap against the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming on top.

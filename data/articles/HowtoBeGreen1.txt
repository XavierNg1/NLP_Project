 Not doing so will build up landfills, but if you do recycle your trash you will be helping the environment! Many items can be recycled, including:


Cardboard boxes such as pizza boxes, egg cartons, milk cartons, juice cartons, pet feed in boxes, etc. But before recycling the cardboard boxes you should first flatten them.
Plastic bottles and containers such as dish washing liquid, bleach bottles, foam soap bottles, salt containers, milk bottles, ketchup containers, etc. Before recycling these you should rinse them out and remove the lids.
Unclassified paper such as magazines, newspaper, etc.
Glass bottles and jars such as alcohol bottles, vinegar bottles, jam jars, sauce jars, etc. Before recycling these you should rinse them out and remove the lids.
Metal cans such as soup cans, surface polish cans, soda cans, tuna cans, etc. These should be rinsed before recycled.;
, Look at the item with a creative eye and turn that old boot into a planter, turn that egg carton into a toy dinosaur or come up with your own unique ideas!

, Composting is a great way to reduce food waste from the kitchen.


A vermicompost is essentially a box full of dirt and worms used to compost kitchen scraps like leftover fruit, vegetables, and other food waste (not meat) and is very good for composting when you live in a small space
There are plenty of ways to compost food, so consider researching a few to find one that could work for you!

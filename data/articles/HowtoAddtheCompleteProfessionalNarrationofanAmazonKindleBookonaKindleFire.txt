 Don't buy the Audible audio-book version first (not only can you save money, but you'll also not be able to connect the two together).;
, It'll give you a button called "Add professional narration" which is only shown when the narration is being played.
 If it has one, good! If not, sorry, no professional narration for this book here yet.

 It'll only take you a second or two to do.
, Hold down on the book's icon, and tap "Download". Once it displays a "percent progress bookmark like icon", you know you've completely downloaded the audiobook.


At this point, yeah, it's on your device, but your book won't recognize it as their being the purchased one on your device, and will tell you "Professional narration added. Preparing to download."

, Open the drop-down notifications bar from the top of the screen, and select "Sync."

, You should now see those "Add professional narration(sample)" messages go away, and a Play/Pause button appear, along with the words "Preparing to download" have disappeared. Now, you can listen to the complete narration of the book from beginning to end.

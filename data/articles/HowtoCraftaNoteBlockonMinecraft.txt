 You need eight wooden planks as well as one redstone.;
, Getting eight wooden planks is fairly easy. Head out to a nearby tree and take down two wood, or the entire tree if you must. Go into your own little crafting work space and turn the wood into wooden planks. To get redstone, you need an iron pick as well as a good mining area. Grab your iron pick and search through your mining area for some red stone. Redstone can be found near bedrock, or any other lower parts of terrain. Mining a redstone ore gives out multiple redstone blocks.
 Find the nearest crafting table, or make one yourself if you have the required recipe.
 Place redstone in the middle and to the left should be the note block. Take it out of the slot and place it in your inventory.
 Congrats! You now have a note block!

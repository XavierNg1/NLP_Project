c5 - Moving the Queen Bishop pawn two spaces forward is the defining move of the Sicilian Defence. This aggressive first move is strong, because if an exchange occurs with White's queen pawn, then Black's center pawns outnumber White's center pawns, which will be an advantage later in the game. This move also avoids symmetry with White.;
, The main advantage of this move is it clears the king side pieces in order to castle kingside soon. It is also strong as it controls one of the centre squares and prepares to play 3.d4.
d6 - This logical move prevents White from playing e5, gaining space and stopping Black's knight from coming to f6. However many players also play 2... Nc6, 2... g6 or 2...e6 for a different setup.
 White forms a pawn chain of their own. However, though this move is not bad it is very passive and does not try for an advantage, d4 is more aggressive and fights for the initiative and advantage.
g6 - The final move of the pawn formation. This move sets Black up to complete a king side Fianchetto; finishing their defences and setting themselves up for a strong queen side attack. This is considered as the Dragon Variation. 5... a6, 5... e6, and 5... Nc6 are also playable

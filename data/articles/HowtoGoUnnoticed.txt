 Whether for a game, avoiding someone or just to blend and relax. It's easier to know what you're doing and why.;
, One of the most important things you can do is dress down. Jeans and a T-shirt are generally good. If you're a girl don't wear tight jeans, low-cut shirts, or tons of make-up. If you're a guy, don't wear your jeans half-way down your butt and a T that's way too big. You're trying not to stand out. It is also best to avoid bright colors, especially reds, oranges and yellows, especially when these colors come in stripes across the body. The human brain is wired to react to these colors, leading you to be noticed more easily.
 People notice people who look as though they don't fit far quicker than people who look as if they walk down this street every day. Practice feeling comfortable in any setting - this takes some confidence.
 If something catches your eye in a shop go look at it, if you feel hungry go get food. If every third person has a shopping bag, go buy something. If half the people around you are eating, then eat. People tend to pass over people who look preoccupied doing something else.
 It doesn't seem important but people hear easier than they see in crowded places. Even if a person is not looking at you they can still hear you.
 If pressed stand still. People notice movement more than shapes. Don't become a statue. Just stand still like you don't have a reason to move, not like you have a reason not to.
 That way you can move slower if you want and people can't see your face as easily.

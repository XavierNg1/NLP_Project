 Draw dots on the graph to represent these points, and note their coordinates.

Remember when graphing points to list the x-coordinate first, then the y-coordinate.

For example, you might choose the points (-3, -2) and (5, 4).
;
, To do this, you must compare the difference in y of the two points. Begin with the first point, the point that is the farthest left on the graph, and count up until you reach the y-coordinate of the second point.

The rise can be positive or negative; that is, you can count up or down to find it.If the line is moving up and to the right, the rise is positive. If the line is moving down and to the right, the rise is negative. For example, if the y-coordinate of the first point is (-2), and the y-coordinate of the second point is (4), you will count up 6 points, so your rise is 6.
 To do this, you must compare the difference in x of the two points. Begin with the first point, the point that is farthest left on the graph, and count over until you reach the x-coordinate of the second point.

To run is always positive; that is, you can only count from left to right, never right to left. For example, if the x-coordinate of the first point is (-3), and the x-coordinate of the second point is (5), you will count over 8, so your run is 8.
 The slope is usually in fraction form, but it can also be a whole number.

For example, if the rise is 6 and the run is 8, then your slope is 68{\displaystyle {\frac {6}{8}}}, which can be simplified to 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}.

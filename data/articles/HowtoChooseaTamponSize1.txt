 Tampon sizes correspond the amount of liquid they can absorb. You can select the right absorbency level for you based on the level of your flow.The most common tampon absorbency levels (moving from smallest to largest) include:

Regular
Super
Super Plus
Some brands may also offer Junior/Slim (smaller than Regular) and/or Ultra (larger than Super Plus).;
, Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) is a rare but serious condition that can result from using higher absorbency tampons. To prevent TSS, you should always use the lowest absorbency level to meet your needs. Start with Regular (or Junior/Slim) tampons, and move up to a higher absorbency level if needed.Symptoms of TSS include: high fever, low blood pressure, vomiting or diarrhea, and a rash that resembles a sunburn.You will know an absorbency level is meeting your needs if it is not saturated in 4-6 hours. If you need to change your tampon more frequently than every 4 hours, or if you are experiencing leaks, you may want to try a higher absorbency.
 For most women, flow is the heaviest on days 1-3 of their cycle. After this, the flow usually begins tapering off (for days 3-7 or longer). You can use higher absorbency tampons on your heavy flow days, and switch to lower absorbency as your period begins to taper off.Look for tampons sold in variety packs, with multiple absorbency levels in one package.
You may want to use a panty liner or pad as a back-up on heavy flow days.
 In order to prevent infections (such as TSS), it is important to remove your tampon every 4-6 hours, even if it is not completely full.If you have just started using tampons, it can be helpful to set a timer for yourself.
Remember to use the lowest absorbency level to meet your needs.

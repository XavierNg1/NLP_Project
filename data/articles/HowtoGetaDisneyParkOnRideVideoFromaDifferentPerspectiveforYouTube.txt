 From plain-regular rides with over the shoulder viewpoints (and for those dark rides with night vision turned on), and many other differences, they all exist some place on the site. Try to get a feel for what's already out there, so your video won't repeat the same information from the same viewpoint as that of all others videos.;

Sometimes they can also be called a POV perspective. If you should see this version, get to know that this is the type you are looking for.
 Some of the Disney rides have high backs where you can't film out back of you, meanwhile others are open air towards your back. Look into taking videos from lap-level as well as other differences, that can make your video unique. Put a different "spin" on the perspective, that other videos existent on the site yet don't contain.


In essence, It's a Small World or the classic Pirates of the Caribbean ride is open air because it doesn't have something that will block the camera's view in the back, meaning you can take videos looking out back of your point of view. However, the Haunted Mansion has a high back, meaning it won't show anything out back of your current point of view and all the viewer would see is the back of the ride vehicle and nothing else.
 It's always best to keep the voice as low as possible, to ensure that the viewer gets the correct relationship out of it from the narration.
 However, if all you have is a DVD-creation type, make sure it's got enough track space to fit the complete ride on it (which you should have already obtained the time-restriction information from the previewed movies before.
 Make sure you can still get to the record and pause/stop button easily.

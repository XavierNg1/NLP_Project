 Toddlers may not do well in organized team sports yet. If you want to encourage a love of athletics early in life, try to engage them in basic exercise activities. These will help your toddler remain active while preparing them for sports later in life. These skills include:


Swimming
Running
Tumbling
Climbing
Throwing
Catching, Before the age of six, children may not be ready for organized group sports. Unstructured play is best for children this age as it allows them to develop essential creative skills. Even if you do join a toddler sports team, make sure that your child still has plenty of time to have unstructured play.Toddlers should not have multiple practices a week or participate in competitive leagues.
Some toddler sports programs do allow them to have unstructured play. Instead of competitive sports, toddlers are encouraged to race and interact with each other.
 If your toddler is involved with a sport, you should make sure that you do not overload them. Do not make them play more than one season of sport a year. This will prevent early overuse injuries, and it will keep your toddler interested in sports in the long term.
 Too much pressure can make your child uninterested in sports, and it may cause injury by the time that they are teenagers. Above all else, encourage the toddler to have fun at this age.Try to avoid yelling at your toddler while they are playing. Even saying something like "Hurry up and get the ball«É" can stress a toddler out while they are trying to develop motor skills.

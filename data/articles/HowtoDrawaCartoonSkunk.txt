 One will serve as the head, one for the body. Draw guidelines to help you out, using the example image for reference.
 These should be fairly large and evenly spaced on the face. Also draw a small triangle for the nose and two triangles for the ears. At this point your skunk should look a little like a cat., Sketch in the tail as shown, making it long and swoopy, like a squirrel's. The more volume on your skunk's tail the better, because that provides you with lots of available surface to detail in the next step., These include the skunk's paws and color separation lines. Remember, the skunk's coat is its only trademark besides its stench, so make that part as dramatic/bold as you can., Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. Erase extraneous guidelines/pencil marks., Skunks are, of course, mostly black and white, but you can always use highlighting and shadowing in different colors to create a more three-dimensional look.

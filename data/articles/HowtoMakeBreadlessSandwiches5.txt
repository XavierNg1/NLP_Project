 Using a vegetable peeler or a sharp knife, peel the jicama. Like you are peeling a potato, make sure you get off all of the skin. Then, slice the jicama into thin, approximately one eight inch slices., In a small bowl, stir the sour cream, mustard, horseradish, chives, and a pinch of freshly ground black pepper. Add salt to taste., Start by laying out the slices of jicama. On each slice, spread a layer of sauce. Then, add a quarter of the ham, cheese and arugula to each of the four sandwiches. Top each sandwich with a jicama slice. Cut each sandwich in half and serve with a pickle on the side.

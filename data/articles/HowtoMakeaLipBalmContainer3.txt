 Make your bottle cap container look more decorative or a fun shape by using clay. Mold the clay to the cap and base in whatever shape you like.


Use colorful modeling clay like Sculpey clay or a similar brand to make your shapes. You can use tools like a plastic knife or toothpick to create designs or texture.
Mold your clay around your container so you know it will fit on after baking. Then pop the clay off and bake it according to the instructions for your specific variety of modeling clay.When the clay is hardened from the oven, let it cool. Then pop it back onto your container. Secure the clay pieces with glue if they don't stay on the container on their own.
 Glue on colorful paper, beads, glitter, or any other material you like to decorate your repurposed container or bottle cap container. Use Mod Podge or a similar craft material to add shine over your decorations.You can also use paint or pens to color directly on your container to make it a different color.
Try decorating your container with the same color as your lip balm, or an image of the lip balmâ€™s flavor, scent, or other ingredients.
 Remember at a glance what kind of lip balm is in your container by creating a label for it. Write directly on the container with a pen or marker, or attach a piece of paper with the label.


Try printing out text from the computer for a typed label. Just make sure to measure your container first to create text that is the right size to attach to it.
Coat your label with Mod Podge or another shellac to make it shiny and look more seamless on a shiny container.

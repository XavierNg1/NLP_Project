 The sun can work wonders in speeding up drying time while offering an antimicrobial effect for your books. Find a spot outdoors safe from animals and bugs, and place your books in the sun.This method is best for newer books, as old books can actually be damaged by exposure to sunlight.
If you do not have an open area with access to sunlight, find a large, sunny window.
 With the pages facing the sun, place your book upright, fanning the pages out as much as you can. This will allow the maximum amount of sunlight and warmth to reach your book. The more warmth and sunlight your book receives, the faster it will dry.Make sure the pages do not clump or stick together, as sunlight could encourage already-tacky pages to stick together.
 Dry your book in this fashion for 2-3 days to eliminate any lingering odors or moisture. The sun will both dry and deodorize your book, while drying the pages will prevent the growth of mold.

To prevent dampness from recurring during the drying period, bring books inside during the night and place them back outside once the sun is shining.
If you cannot keep your books safely outside for this period, you can also use a large indoor space with access to a window.

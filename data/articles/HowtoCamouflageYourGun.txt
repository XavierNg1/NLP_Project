 Give it just a base coat or a breakup pattern. Make sure the paint is matte; a shiny surface could give you away. The black base of a gun makes it a clear silhouette in the human mind, and is easy to spot.;
, Riflerags are good for large distances of engagement, but for airsoft and paintball, the burlap is easily seen. The way to go is natural foliage. The cheapest way to camouflage your gun is to find some soft branches, tie them around the gun, and insert foliage into them; this however won't last all day, and will need replacing. A better way to make sure the foliage stays in, is to use an elastic cord, twirl it around the gun, and insert the foliage at several points (2 points is enough for branches and grass; more may be needed for moss).
 For the front lens, take a piece of dyed burlap; take out some of the strands, and secure it with green tape or rubber. You can also cover the upper and lower part of the front with solid material like moss or textile if the lighting conditions allow it. This will certainly hinder the give away lens-reflection.
, You do not however want to stand out in front of your background as an inverted silhouette, so add some pieces of branches and so on to the gun.

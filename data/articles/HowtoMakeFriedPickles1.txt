 Fill the saucepan with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of vegetable oil. Test the temperature using a deep-fry thermometer. Alternatively, you can add a pinch of flour to the oil to see if it immediately browns and bubbles. If it does, then the oil is ready.;
, Combine 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of cornmeal, and 3 lightly-beaten eggs in a large bowl. Mix the ingredients together until you've created a thick, even batter for the pickles.
, Use tongs or a fork to lower each pickle into the batter and move it around until it's completely covered in it. Hold it above the batter for a second or two so that the excess batter drips off the pickle.
 Once you've covered a sauce pan's worth of pickles in the batter, it's time to start frying them. Lower the pickles into the hot oil using a mesh basket or a set of tongs. Fry them until they are crispy and golden brown, which should take about three minutes, depending on the size of the saucepan. The pickles are done when they float easily on the surface of the oil. Once one batch of pickles is fried, move on to the next.


Avoid crowding the pan or you'll bring down the temperature of the oil. The pickles will be soggy instead of crispy.
 Place them on plates covered in paper towels to absorb excess oil.
 Serve the fried pickles immediately with a small bowl of ranch dressing for dipping.

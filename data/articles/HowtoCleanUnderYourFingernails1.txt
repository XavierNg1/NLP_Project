 Orange sticks are wooden sticks that have a point on one end and a sloping flat edge on the other side, similar to a flat head screwdriver. You can find them in the beauty department near the nail care items.


You can also use a cuticle pusher or a clean toothpick, but they are harder to use than the orange stick.;
, Start by clearing away dirt and excess oil. Scrub your hands under warm water, paying special attention to under your nails. Wash away as much of the grime as you can using the soap and water.


Turn your hands so that the water runs over the underside of your nails.
Pull back your fingers and work the soap under your nails using the pads of your fingers.
Pat your hands dry when you finish. It will be hard to use an orange stick if your hands are wet.
 Gently press the stick under your nail, being careful not to break the skin. You need to go as deep as you can without separating the skin from the nail. If you do, then youâ€™ll create a haven for dirt and bacteria.You may find it easier to use the pointed end to remove the grime under your nails; however, it is riskier to use the pointed end because you may accidentally break the skin.
 Start at one corner of your finger and gently insert the edge of the orange stick. Press it down until you feel resistance from your finger., Move the orange stick from one corner to the other. Wipe the grime onto a napkin and repeat until the orange stick comes away clean.

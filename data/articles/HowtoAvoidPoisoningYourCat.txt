 Cats and cream or milk seem to go hand in hand. We picture a cute cat lapping from a bowl of milk, but in reality, cats cannot properly digest dairy products and it can give them a stomach upset. If you want to give your cat milk then buy milk specially formulated for cats that is free from lactose. Cats will be happy enough just given water to drink though.;
, They may seem to enjoy it, but the balance of nutrients in dog food is completely wrong for the dietary requirements of a cat. A long term dog food diet will lead to malnutrition.
 Cats adore tuna, but you should also be careful with this. A little now and again will be a tasty treat, but if you're feeding your cat tuna as a major part of their diet, they can suffer from malnutrition as although it is delicious, it is lacking in nutrients that your cat needs to stay fit and healthy.
 Caffeine can be lethal to cats so be careful if you leave a cup of tea or coffee where they can get at it. Don't forget there is also caffeine in chocolate. You may feel like you're really treating your cat by offering it a piece of chocolate, but it's very dangerous for them. If you want to give your cat chocolate you can buy commercial chocolate like treats for them, but as cats don't have a sweet tooth, there really is no point.
 They usually won't like the smell of it, but be careful if you have a glass within their reach. Even a teaspoon of a strong spirit can kill a cat. Raisins and grapes can cause kidney failure in cats so these should not be fed as a treat. Also be careful if you have a pot of chives on the windowsill or growing in your garden. Onions and chives are poisonous to cats. A small amount shouldn't do them much harm, but eaten in a large quantity they can have a bad effect.
 Sugar free sweets are also dangerous for cats, the ingredient xylitol is often used as a substitute for sugar in such sweets. Cats are very sensitive to this substance and it can cause liver failure.

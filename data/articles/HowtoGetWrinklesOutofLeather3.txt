 Get your shower warm enough so that it is capable of fogging up the glass in your bathroom. Keep it warm enough so that the steam builds, but no so hot that you canâ€™t actually shower in the water.


If you have a means of monitoring temperature in your shower, keep the water at around 105 F (40.5 C), the average temperature for a shower., As it does so, close the door to keep any steam from escaping. Put your leather item on a hanger and leave hanging in the bathroom near to the source of steam, but far away enough from the shower that no water gets on the leather.Try using a towel rack or a door knob as a place to hang your leather item.
Leather is not intended to deal with large quantities of water. Keep your leather far enough from the shower that no water drops get on it. If you notice water condensing on the leather, gently blot it off with a clean, dry towel.
 Allow the garment to sit in the steam for as long as possible. Let it remain in the bathroom during the length of your shower, then allow it to hang in the bathroom a bit longer. Wait until the steam starts to dissipate and the bathroom starts to cool before removing the garment.


Do not let the bathroom cool completely. This will set the leather and stop you from smoothing out any remaining creases.
 When you're done steaming, lay out the garment on a flat surface and smooth it out with your hands. Pull stubborn wrinkles gently to relax them.


Allow the leather to cool on the flat surface before moving or wearing it. This helps set the smoothed leather and prevents re-wrinkling.

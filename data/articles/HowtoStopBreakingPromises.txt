 This is a difficult thing to do for many people, mainly because it sounds so simple but is actually quite complicated. Sometimes you say something without thinking it through properly. By the time you realise you shouldn't have said it, the person you said it to has taken it seriously or is relying on it. To avoid this situation, and avoid making impossible promises, don't open your mouth if you haven't thought it through.;
, If the person you make a promise to is in a vulnerable or hurt condition, then think very carefully about making a promise to them. People in this type of condition tend to take a promise to heart, and will gain hope from it. It will be a bad idea to break a promise to them. If, on the other hand, the person you've made a promise to is emotionally strong and independent, you can relax a little.
 Sometimes we promise somebody something because we wish we could do it for them, not because we actually can. Think about this very, very carefully. If you promise something, be sure that you will be able to fulfill it without a struggle or a chance of failure. This can sometimes be the main cause of broken promises.
 If you make a promise, think about it. Consider what you can do, how you can fulfill it, and the impact it will have on people. This step ties in with the first one, and is extremely important. If you don't take your promises seriously, and consider the consequences of them, you can end up breaking them or hurting other people.
 If the answer doesn't come to you immediately, don't just give up. Do what you can to fulfill and keep your promise. This will ensure you keep your promises and gain trust from those close to you. The solution may not always be obvious, but it's always there.

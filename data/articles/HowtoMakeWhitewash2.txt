, Whitewash looks best on raw wood so you need to use sandpaper, a sanding block, or an orbital sander to sand down the furniture. This will remove any finish already on the furniture for the whitewash paint to create the look youâ€™re wanting., You need to remove all of the sawdust from sanding before painting the whitewash on the furniture to ensure a smooth finish. Use a dry cloth to wipe down the furniture and remove any dust on it.
 Add one part paint to one part water in a bucket or container, and mix well. This will thin down the latex paint making it look more like traditional whitewash when you paint it on the furniture by letting the natural wood grain show through the paint., Use a paintbrush to paint the whitewash onto the furniture using long brush strokes that follow the wood grain.Work in small sections because whitewash dries quickly.
Allow the paint to dry completely, and then add more coats until you reach your desired look.
 If desired, after the paint dries. you can paint a water-based polyurethane on the furniture to create a sealant and a finish. This is optional, but may make the whitewash look last longer.


Choose between a matte or satin finish.

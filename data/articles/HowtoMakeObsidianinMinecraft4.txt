 The End portal leads to the final, most challenging area in Minecraft. Locating it and activating is a long quest involving many Eyes of Ender. Try this only when you're ready to face the fearsome Ender Dragon.


If you are on Pocket Edition, the End Portal will only work on infinite (not "Old") worlds running on version 1.0 or later (released December 2016).
 When you travel through the End portal, a platform of 25 obsidian blocks will appear for you to stand on. Mine it with the diamond pickaxe (though you may want to kill that dragon bothering you first).
 The island with the Ender Dragon has several tall towers with purple crystals atop them. The towers are made entirely of obsidian.
 You can return to the Overworld either by dying, or by defeating the Ender Dragon and walking through the exit portal that appears. Each time you walk through an End portal, te 25-block obsidian platform will respawn. This makes it one of the fastest ways to get infinitely recurring obsidian.


The obsidian pillars do not respawn unless you respawn the dragon. To bring back the dragon, place four ender crystals on top of the exit portal that appeared when the dragon died.

 Remember to refrigerate the leftover slices by wrapping them in cling wrap and putting in the fridge, or simply by putting the whole box into the fridge. This will ensure that in the morning there isn't any unidentifiable gunk on your pizza.;
, If you have a selection of pizzas, choose slices that are going to fill you up and that look tasty, for example, look for ones with lots of sauce and toppings you like. Once you know what you're going to have, grab a plate and a cup.
 You may need to reheat them again if they are not hot - and if the cheese hasn't melted.
 Find a place that is cozy, such as your room or in front of the computer.
 Many people eat pizza by the gulp full, others slowly. Try not to eat it too fast, as by eating it fast you can not appreciate the flavours. Each mouthful will be full of flavour sensations, and while your body may not thank you for all the carbohydrates, your taste buds will.
 So you had a yummy breakfast, not too nutritional, but you can make up for it by cleaning up after yourself. It has a way of finishing the experience as well as keeping clutter to a minimum.

 Hep A has a discrete onset of flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain and sometimes followed by jaundice, dark-colored urine and clay-colored stools. Jaundice is yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, or sclera (whites of the eyes) that often appears two to three weeks after onset of flu-like symptoms and post resolution of an active illness. Jaundice is caused by excess bilirubin in the body. Bilirubin is a yellow-orange pigment in bile made by the liver when red blood cells are broken down. High bilirubin in the body indicates a problem with the liver.The easiest place to notice jaundice at home is yellowing of the whites of the eyes.;

 Rough Collies are naturally clean dogs and only require bathing every 6-8 weeks, less regularly than other breeds. Given the volume and length of hair that Rough Collies have, it is best to brush out mats and excess hair before bathing them to allow water to penetrate their coat more easily. Brush from your dog’s rear, upwards, against the grain of the hair.Be sure to bathe your dog during its molting period, which occurs about once a year for males and three times every two years for females.
 Place a towel or non-slip mat on the shower floor and have your Rough Collie stand on it. Wet its coat from its rear upwards, then apply dog shampoo (available at pet stores) and lather in the same direction. To make things easier, try brushing shampoo through your dog’s coat rather than lathering it with your fingers.Never use human shampoo on your dog- it is harsher than dog shampoo and will wash away the essential oils from your dog's coat, which can leave your dog vulnerable to bacteria and parasites., Thoroughly rinse out the shampoo from your dog’s hair. Given the Rough Collie’s thick double coat, devote extra time to rinsing to prevent soap build up that could cause skin irritations. Squeeze out as much excess water as you can., Once all the shampoo is rinsed out, take a step back and let your dog shake off before drying it. Using a large towel, pat your dog down to remove excess water. Use a blow dryer on a low setting to dry your dog’s coat completely.To avoid tangles, hold the blow dryer at a distance from your dog and blow dry slowly.

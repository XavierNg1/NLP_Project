 See How to canter with your horse and How to sit the canter properly for more information.;
, Always ride a quiet, push button horse/pony when doing your first canter, preferably a comfy one too.
 If the girth isn't tight enough, then it might become loose and you could slip off.
 Get your instructor or even a person who has ridden a couple of times before, to tell you how you can improve your seat in trot and walk first.
 If you are focusing on getting your horse to go, then you won't be focusing on yourself and what you should be doing. Even though it might feel very beginner-like, it will all pay off in the end when you have the best canter in the lesson.
 Don't let your butt come off the saddle. Try to stay with the motion of your horse. It should feel as if you're rocking your hips slightly when you sit the canter.
 Keep the heels down., Seek to enjoy it, because if you are worrying the wobbliness out of a jelly, then you shouldn't be on a horse. Just relax, have fun and get used to the rhythm of the canter.

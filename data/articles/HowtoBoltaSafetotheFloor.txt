 Find a place that is hidden from view but easy to access in case you need to get to the contents quickly.;
, Most fireproof safes have the hole in the middle of the unit. Other safes will have a mounting hole or holes in the corners.
, If you have carpet on the floor where you will be placing the safe, use a knife to cut a circle out of the carpet that is large enough to accommodate the bolt and the mounting hole.
 Use a drill bit that is appropriate for your floor. Concrete floors will need a concrete drill bit, and wood floors will require a wood drill bit.


Ensure you have the proper drill bit size. Most wood floors are 1 inch (2.54 cm) thick. For concrete floors, use the size of the bolt that comes with the safe to determine the right size of concrete drill bit. If you are unsure, take the bolt to a hardware store and ask a sales associate for the right one.
 Run the vacuum over the hole to catch any dust that is inside of it.
 Line it up so that the hole in the safe sits directly over the hole in the floor.
 You may need to hammer the bolt 2 or 3 times in order to fit it into the hole.
 This will expand the sleeve on the bolt and fasten to the walls of the floor. Keep turning it until it is tight and unable to turn any further.

Take note that you will have to stick towards the very bottom of the screen. It is in a space of calm water there with a dark spot to Dive. Go where the inscription is and press B; say yes and go to the end. Use Dig go to the end of that tunnel and read the inscription. Put Relicanth last in your party and Wailord first, then go back and read the inscription again and there will be an earthquake. If this doesn't work go and switch Relicanth to first and Wailord to last and there should be an earthquake. Then a box tells you it sounds like doors opening far away. Remember to save before each fight!;
, Look around for a cave and go to the bottom. At the end of the cave you will see the braille. You must be in the center of the wall. Stay at the wall move 2 steps left and 2 steps down and use Rock Smash.
 Use Surf, and go southwest until you get to an island. Go across it and go north from there and you will discover a cave. Enter and read the Braille. Walk counter clock-wise around the edges of the entire chamber and the door will open.
 Go west as far as you can. You will see a berry patch or just some dirt. Go up those stairs, go past the little trainer hiding, through the grass, past the hiker and into the cave. Go in the Ancient Tomb. Go to the direct center of the cave and use Flash. You will open the cave entrance. Go through the door and prepare to fight Registeel after saving.

 Pour cool water into a clean pot, tub, or container large enough to completely hold and cover your turkey. For this method, the shape of the container doesn't matter. The water must be no warmer than 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.44 degrees Celsius) to avoid bacterial growth.Place resealable plastic bags of ice into the container to keep the water temperature cool, if necessary.;
, While still in its packaging, place the turkey breast-side down in the water. The turkey must be completely submerged in the water.If the turkey is not in its original packaging, place the turkey in a sealed, leak-proof plastic bag.
This will help prevent cross-contamination.Use a heavy baking dish or other clean, heavy item to weigh the bird down so it stays fully submerged in the water.
 Try not to drip everywhere. Even if the turkey was sealed, some of the water may be contaminated with bacteria.
 Pour all of the water out, and then replace the water with fresh, cold water. Be sure that it remains under 40 degrees, and add new ice if necessary., Place the turkey back into the water, and let sit for another 30 minutes., This method will defrost your turkey at a rate of about 30 minutes per pound. For example, if your turkey weighs 12 pounds, you must allow the turkey to thaw using this method for approximately six hours.

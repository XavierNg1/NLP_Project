 When you get the carrots home from the grocery store or farmer’s market, they may still have dirt and bacteria on their skins. To prepare them for julienning, rinse them under cool water and scrub them with a vegetable brush under the running water.








If you plan to peel your carrots, you don’t necessarily need to scrub them.
 It’s safe to eat carrot skin, but some people don’t like its slightly bitter taste. Before julienning the carrots, you may want to use a Y-peeler to remove the skin, particularly if it’s very thick.








When you’re running the peeler over the carrots, try to use a single stroke from the top to the bottom to keep the shape of the carrot as uniform as possible.
 To ensure that your carrots are ready for julienning, it’s important to trim them. Use a sharp chef’s knife to chop off the blunt edge at the top of the carrot, as well as the tip. Depending on what method of julienning that you’re using, you may need to chop the carrot further.

 Adults, by nature, have to be more self driven than children. There isn’t always going to be someone there to guide you through the daily motions of life. You must find ways to challenge and motivate yourself in order to achieve your goals.For example, if you have a goal to eat healthier and exercise five times a week to lose ten pounds, you must find the motivation to do this yourself. Waking up forty-five minutes early to pack your lunch and take a jog shows that you are self driven.
 As you transition into adulthood you must learn to set short term and long term goals. These goals will help you stay motivated and self driven. Once you have set a goal, create a plan to achieve that goal.An example of a long term goal is getting a job as an accountant. Whereas a short term goal is enrolling in an accounting class.
 Managing your money is an important part of an adult male’s life. By creating a budget you can be sure that all of your bills are paid, maintain a good credit score, and hopefully even save money. A budget can be simple and does not need to be created by an expert.Create a list of all of your expenses. Keep in mind that bills are not your only expense. You also need money for food, transportation, clothing, etc.
In a separate list, record all of your income.
Be sure not to allow your expenses to exceed your income. If you have an excess at the end of each pay period, consider putting it into savings or investments.
 Everyone makes mistakes. Part of becoming a mature adult is taking responsibility for the mistakes that you make. By doing this, you will begin to win over the trust and respect of other adults. Own up to your mistakes and then do what you can to correct it.For example, you should admit to backing into your neighbor’s mailbox, even if nobody witnessed it. Inform your neighbor of your mistake and repair or replace their mailbox for them. This will show that you are taking responsibility and holding yourself accountable for your actions.

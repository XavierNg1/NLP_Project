 Heat 'em up in your saucepan until softened and turning golden brown.
 Stir well, being sure everything is coated in the olive oil. And if you need a bit more olive oil, no one's going to tell on you!


By the way, you peeled and sliced your carrots, right? That outer stuff (you know, the part that lived in dirt) isn't what you're going for here. But they're gonna get puréed later, so it's not like they have to be pretty. Just chop 'em up into finger-width pieces.
 Keep an eye on the onions especially -- if they're overcooking, turn the heat down a notch.


Sometimes carrots get a little bitter inexplicably when cooked. If that's the case (give 'er a taste test), add in a tablespoon of brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup to offset it.
 The rice is, of course, optional. You could also substitute potatoes for the rice -- or just not worry about either. Whatever you choose, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.


Make sure to add the liquid before or immediately after adding the rice. Otherwise it'll burn!
Want to get a little Asian up in here? You can use coconut milk as a bit of the liquid, too!

, The hand blender is super easy to use--you literally just place it in your pot and go. Then when you're done, rinse it off and you're good to go. But if this need was unforeseen, a food processor or even blender will work, too.


If you didn't purée it in the pan, take it back to the pan and reheat.
 Season with salt and pepper and season to taste, garnishing with green onion or parsley if desired. Be sure to serve it to your guests warm!


Other good garnishes? Nuts, bacon, grated cheese, dill and mint. And don't forget the bread and butter!

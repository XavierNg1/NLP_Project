 'Limelight' can be pruned in late winter or very early spring to reduce its size, improve its appearance or encourage it to produce larger flowers.


It produces flowers on new stems each year so pruning it in the winter or early spring will not reduce the number of flowers it produces.
 They do not have to be trimmed at all but can be to even up the branches and tidy up their appearance.


Dead branches should be removed at the base of the branch whenever they are noticed.
 After 'Limelight' has been growing for a year or two, all of the stems can be pruned back to about 6 inches (15 cm) tall to keep it from getting too big.Thin the shrub to five to ten main branches in the spring to get larger flower clusters.Select five to ten new healthy branches to keep then prune the rest of the branches back to a height of 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm). This will let 'Limelight' devote more energy to fewer branches resulting in larger flowers.
 Hedge shears will tear the leaves and make 'Limelight' look ragged.

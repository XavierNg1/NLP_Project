 Fold each bra in half, inverting one cup so that it collapses into the other.








The cups of non-molded bras are not as easily distorted, so you should be able to invert them without causing any damage to the integrity of the cup shape or the overall bra.
 Fasten the hooks of the back strap together. Tuck the straps into the cup of the bra once clasped together.


Doing this can prevent the hooks from snagging any other bras or clothes.
 Fold each bra separately, then stack them together. Stack one on top of another so that the cups of one bra rest over the cups of the one beneath it.


Since the cups are not as sensitive as they would be with a molded bra, you do not need to stuff them with any excess material to prevent them from collapsing when you pack them.
 If possible, place the bras in a separate zipper compartment of your suitcase instead of keeping them in the main space with the rest of your clothes.


Another option would be to slide the stacked bras into a large plastic bag. Choose a durable bag, like a “freezer safe” resealable bag or the type you would get from a department store. You can then place this bag into the main compartment of your suitcase and the bras should stay protected from zippers, clasps, Velcro, and similar threats.
 When you reach your destination, remove the bras from your suitcase and keep them out for the remainder of your stay.









While it is not as crucial to unpack non-molded bras as it is to unpack molded bras, it is still advisable. Leaving any bra in a stuffed suitcase for a prolonged period can cause damage to the underwire and the overall integrity of the bra.
You can hang your unpacked bras on a hook, hanger, or doorknob. Try to avoid hanging them beneath heavy items, though. Even though the cups of a non-molded bra cannot be easily distorted, you can still damage the integrity of the bra if you crush it carelessly.

 If not surgical tubing, you can use some form of long rubber band. If you can't find something like these, buy a box of the heavy gauge rubber bands that the post office uses around bundles of mail. You will want about 20 feet (6.1 m) of the item in it's unstretched condition. You will need two small gate hooks from any hardware store, too. (See tips below.);
, By linking these together you will end up with a long stretchy band of continuous rubber bands.
 Tie one end of all three strands into a knot so it ends up looking like three strands of spaghetti hanging from your hand.
, This is what you may have learned in elementary school. You know, lay them side by side and take the left one over the middle one to become the middle one and then take the right one over the middle one to make a new middle one. Keep repeating this process until the entire length is braided. Don't do it too loose or real tight. You might want to experiment a little before the next step.
 Tie off the final end by wrapping it in strong string, wire, several twist-ties, or something that will keep if from unraveling, or simply tie them in a knot again.
, It should be about 6 feet (1.8 m). long when up.
 For example you can take the bottom hem of a shirt and put a small part through the braided strands then take another part of the bottom hem on the other side of the shirt and do the same thing further down the line.

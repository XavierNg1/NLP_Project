 If the nerve has been only partially compressed or severed, it can repair itself over time. This is because the nerve tissue beyond the damage point dies and the nerve must regenerate between healthy nerve endings.A pinched nerve can occur from a number of reasons including: bad posture, injury, arthritis, spinal stenosis, and/or obesity.;

NSAIDs treats swelling and inflamed nerves, acetaminophen only treats pain.Be sure that these medications will not interact with any other medication. For example, avoid taking aspirin when on blood thinners.
Long-term NSAID use can lead to gastritis and gastric ulcers. Be aware of your use of these medications.
 If a nerve was pinched, rather than severed, physical therapy (PT) is often used to repair the damage and increase strength and mobility. Check if your doctor will prescribe physical therapy.


Some insurance companies will not cover PT. Always check with your insurance company if you have a question about billing.
You may need to wait several weeks or months after acute injury to start this phase of repair. The nerve may need time to heal and regrow.
Try de-weighted training in the the pool for problems with movement on land. After you build up your stamina try some strength and resistance training.
 Some patients find that acupuncture calms the nerves and allows them to continue normal function while the nerves repair themselves.


Biofeedback can also be helpful. This is a technique you can use to control your bodyâ€™s functions. You are connected to electronic sensors that provides information that will help you focus and relax.Unfortunately, neither acupuncture nor biofeedback are typically covered under American health insurance plans.

 Some researchers have found that actively thinking about your strengths and positive characteristics can help build a stronger self-esteem.Having a stronger sense of self may help you feel more comfortable with your new braces, and may make it easier to smile and feel confident.
 Having one or more daily affirmations may help empower you and make you feel more confident and sure of yourself.You can use tried and true affirmations, such as "I am a valuable, compassionate person" and "I feel positive and loving toward myself."Or you can create your own affirmations related to having braces, such as "I know that I have a beautiful smile; it will only be better because of my braces."

, It's common for everyone to have negative or self-doubting thoughts from time to time, but it's important to always remember that these thoughts are not who we really are.Any time you find yourself thinking negative thoughts about your braces or how they look, stop that thought pattern in its tracks and remind yourself that your braces won't be on forever, and you'll have a flawless smile when you're finished.

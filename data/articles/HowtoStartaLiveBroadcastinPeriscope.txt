 Locate the app on your iPhone and tap on it. The app logo has a picture of a periscope on cyan background.;
, If you’ve used the app before, you won’t need to log in again; otherwise, log in by tapping “Log into Twitter.”


You will be brought to your main dashboard screen. The list of people you are following that are live and that have recently broadcasted will be shown.
 This will open the “Broadcast now” screen, but you are not broadcasting yet. You should set a few parameters before you begin.
 A text field appears at the top of the “Broadcast Now” screen. Before you begin broadcasting, it will be good if you type something about what you’re going to show in the text field.
 Right below the text field are four options you can set to control your video sharing.


Tap the arrow icon to enable Location Sharing. This means that people watching your video will know where you are. Leave this if you don’t want to share your location.
Tap the padlock icon if you want to do a Private Broadcast. Private Broadcasts do not appear in the Global List, and only the people you invite can join. Enter the names of the people you want to invite to your Private Broadcast on the next screen. Leave this if you’re okay to publicly share your video.
Tap the chat icon if you want only users you follow to chat on the video. This will restrict others from leaving their messages on your video. Leave this if you want to let everybody speak freely.
Tap the Twitter icon if you want your video to be posted as a tweet. Once you start broadcasting, it will also be posted on your Twitter, which means everyone following you there can also see it. Leave this if you don’t want to post a tweet about your video.
 You are now live, and people can watch you live, so start pointing your camera to yourself or to the areas you want captured.

 Single bonds, or sigma (ùùà) bonds, are the result of two s orbitals overlapping. Electrons are shared in the overlap region, and this region can be found between the two nuclei. For this reason, the area is referred to as the internuclear axis.Sigma bonds overlap head-on. This means they have the most effective overlap, and thus form the strongest bond.
 While sigma bonds all reside between the nuclei of two atoms, p orbitals form a different kind of bond. Because of the shape of a p orbital, it forms what is known as a pi (ùùÖ) bond. The pi bond exists above and below the nuclei of the atoms, and therefore, is outside of the internuclear axis.P orbitals do not overlap as well as s orbitals, so pi bonds are easier to break (weaker) than sigma bonds.
Above and below the nuclei is the accepted orientation for the first pi bond. However, it is possible to have another pi bond that is perpendicular to the first. This bond would be considered to reside on either side of the nuclei.
 To visualize these different bonds, you have to superimpose the orbital of one atom on the orbital of the other. To visualize pi bonds, imagine two dumbbells being pushed together. The tops and bottoms would touch, but the centers would not. Sigma bonds can be compared to two balls being forced together. They meet head on and the bond resides in the internuclear axis, which could be compared to the space between the centers of the two balls.

 Unlike a piano or many other instruments which can play each pitch only one way, a guitar can play multiple notes of the same pitch. This means that you can tune a guitar by matching these notes together. Practice playing and listening to two notes of the same pitch together, like the fifth fret on the fourth string and the open third string.When the notes are tuned correctly, they will sound identical.
If the notes are not tuned to the exact same pitch, you will hear a wavering sound called “beating.”
To tune, adjust one of the strings up or down until this beating slows and then disappears.
 Start by assuming that your sixth string (the low E) is in tune. Play the note at the fifth fret on the sixth string, and the fifth string open. Listen to see if the notes sound the same. If not, adjust the fifth string until it matches the note played at the fifth fret on the sixth string.Repeat this pattern by playing the fifth string at the fifth fret with the open fourth string, then the fourth string at the fifth fret with the open third string. Adjust the strings as necessary.
Strings 6-3 will then be tuned to each other.
 The pattern varies when tuning the second string. Play the third string at the fourth fret and the open second string. Adjust the second string as necessary until the note is correct. Then play the second string at the fifth fret together with the second string and tune in the same way., Think of “55545” as an easy way to remember the notes you should fret and pair with the next string (open) in order to tune your guitar. Once you learn how to tune in this way, you can start with either the low E string and go up, or the high E string and go down.

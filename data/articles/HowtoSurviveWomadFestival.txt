, Go for an extra special shopping extravaganza during which you purchase all the essentials for an extreme WOMAD experience. Buy such items as food, alcohol, wet wipes and dry shampoo.
 Check out the dates that you buy them as in some cases, the closer to the festival date you purchase the tickets the cheaper they are. You could always drive of course in which case, invest in a map. If you live next to the festival or fairly nearby then just have fun okay, and skip to step four.
 If there are several of you attending and between you you have several tents, put them in a circle with the entrances facing the middle. This way it's far more sociable. If you have one, perhaps place a gazebo in the middle. This is a good place to sit as people walking past may come and join you if you have made it all lovely and nice. It is always a good idea to have a tarpaulin to sit on for when the grass is wet in the morning and the evening then you still have somewhere to sit.
 Don't mix your drinks and try to be fairly sensible or you won't remember your truly fantastic WOMAD experience.
 Mornings may prove difficult at times, but keep pushing on. Showers are available but baby wipe washes and dry shampoo will suffice. Go and purchase a nice cold glass of orange juice and a slice of toast, or cook something up on a camping stove. Once you've got some food inside of you, you'll have plenty of energy to continue the day.

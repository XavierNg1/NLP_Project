 If your allergy is severe, ask the people in advance if they own cats. If you find they do, let them know that you won't be able to come because you are allergic. To still spend time with these friends, ask to meet them at a different place or invite them over instead.


If they are really good friends or you canâ€™t avoid going to visit, ask if they have a cat-free zone. If not, see if they can create one for you by keeping the cat in another room, vacuuming, and changing linens to reduce the cat dander., Once you visit a place that has a cat, the cat dander left on your clothing can cause a continued allergic reaction. When you return home, wash your clothes on in hot water in order to remove the dander from your clothes.This is true of people who own cats. Their clothes likely have dander on then, especially if you can see visible cat hair. Without making a big deal out of it, simply let such people know that you have a bad allergy to cats and that you will have to keep your distance.
In the workplace, this may mean sitting away from cat owners. However, don't be rude about it. You may have an allergy but the cat owner also has feelings. Explain things kindly, in the spirit of compromise.
 This may seem like common sense, but even if you love cats, avoid direct contact with any cat. This will minimize the chances of setting off your allergy because your allergies can be triggered by the allergens left on your hands. There is a protein in the saliva of cats (Fel D1) that seems to trigger allergic reactions.By not stroking the cat, you avoid picking up this allergen. If you must pet the cat, wash your hands immediately with soap and warm water.You should also avoid bringing a cat close to your face or kissing a cat.

 Keep in mind that ammonia can have harmful effects when inhaled. Improve the air circulation. Open windows and doors, switch on exhaust fans, and/or set up other fans to get the air moving., Chances are that in areas like bathrooms, your options for improving airflow are pretty limited. In this case, be sure to wear a respirator that will filter out the fumes. Or just wear one anyway to be extra-safe., First, improve the ventilation in the area you’re mixing this if you’re doing so somewhere other than the area that needs cleaning. Then mix equal parts ammonia and water either directly in a spray bottle or another container before pouring the mix into your bottle with a funnel., Once your solution is mixed, squirt an even amount over the moldy caulk. Wait five to ten minutes for it to settle in and start killing the mold. Then scrub the sprayed caulk with a small brush. Wipe the caulk down with a cloth or paper towels to remove all traces when finished.
 If the first application didn’t kill or remove all the mold, try again. If repeated tries don’t seem to be doing anything, use another cleaner. Keep in mind that ammonia can be an effective mold killer with non-porous surfaces, but often has difficulty with porous ones like caulk., Be aware that caulk may look clean after you’ve scrubbed and wiped it down, but mold may still be present. If it reappears soon after your attempt with ammonia, treat this as a sign that the mold’s roots are too deep in the caulk for the ammonia to reach it effectively. Move on to another solution.

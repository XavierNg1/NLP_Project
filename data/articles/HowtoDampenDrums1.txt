 Experiment with the placement of the muffling. Note the difference of sound when the muffling is touching or not touching the batter head. The batter head is the drum head that is struck with the kick pedal.
 The drum head is the head that is not struck by the pedal. Use a razor blade and cut somewhere between the rim and the center of the drum. Use a bowl or coffee can to outline the cut. A bigger hole results in less resonance., Cut a strip of cloth about 4 inches (10 cm) wide. Secure the strip against the drum head by tightening the ends inside the tuning rim. The strip is usually set to the left or right side of the drum head, not in the center.

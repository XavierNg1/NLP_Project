 Make sure the cardboard is on an ironing board to avoid burning any surface underneath the cardboard.
 You want the iron to loosen the gum without melting it completely, as that can make it even messier.
 You should now have the gum sandwiched between the cardboard and the iron, with the fabric of the clothing providing a barrier between the gum and the iron.
 It may take several minutes for the gum to heat up completely.
 The gum should pull off of the clothing along with the cardboard. If the gum does not pull away, continue to iron the clothing until it is soft enough to do so.

 If you’re grooming outside, find a spot where your pet will not be standing in mud. A good trick is to have your pet stand in a children’s wading pool while you wash them. Make sure your hose will reach the spot, and place your shampoo and a towel nearby., Use the water hose to completely saturate your pet’s fur. Start behind the head, and run the hose over their body. Make sure the fur is completely wet so the shampoo will lather and cleanse the coat thoroughly. Don’t forget to wet your pup’s belly., Start with about a quarter sized amount. From the neck back, work the shampoo into the coat. Massage all the way to your dog’s skin to remove oils, dirt, and other debris. Add more shampoo as necessary to completely clean the entire body., Using the hose, run the water over your pup’s coat until there are no more suds in the water that runs off. It’s important to remove all of the soap as it may irritate your pet’s skin as it dries and flakes. Additionally, your dog could become sick if they lick the shampoo from their fur later. Even nontoxic shampoos can upset your pet’s stomach., Gently apply water, trying to avoid direct contact with the eyes, nose, and mouth. Apply a small amount of tear free shampoo to the fur around the ears, eyes, and muzzle. Then, rinse it away, trying to avoid allowing soapy water to run into your dog’s eyes or mouth., Let them shake the water off if they want to. Then, pat your dog dry with a towel. Next, use a blow dryer to completely dry your pet. You can use a dryer that’s made for animals or people. Since your pet has thick fur, this can take awhile. Use a brush to prevent the hair from mating or tangling as you blow dry their coat. If it’s warm outside, you may want to let your dog air dry, but avoid this in colder weather, as your dog can get sick if it’s body temperature drops too low.

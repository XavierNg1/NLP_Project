 Once youâ€™ve chosen the right cleaning product for you, it is time to actually mop your floor. Start by filling a big bucket with clean, hot water. If you will be adding any additional detergent or cleanser, add this to the water now.You should plan to mop your wood laminate floor around once per month, or anytime the floor gets really dirty.
 Excess moisture can damage your wood laminate floor, so you will want to choose a mop that can be effectively wrung out. Dip your mop into the water and wring out it as much as possible.Sponge mops are usually best for this task.
 Carefully move your mop across the floor from one side of the room to the other. When your mop becomes too dry, return it to the water and wring it out again. Make your way across the room.
 Once again, moisture can damage your floors, and water should never be left to stand. Use as little water as possible while mopping. After mopping, use a soft towel to completely dry your floors.

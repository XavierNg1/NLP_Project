 The formula is simply Area = 1/2 x perimeter x apothem., Let's say the apothem is 5√3 cm.
 Since the apothem is perpendicular to the side of the hexagon, it creates one side of a 30-60-90 triangle. The sides of a 30-60-90 triangle are in the proportion of x-x√3-2x, where the length of the short leg, which is across from the 30 degree angle, is represented by x, the length of the long leg, which is across from the 60 degree angle, is represented by x√3, and the hypotenuse is represented by 2x.The apothem is the side that is represented by x√3. Therefore, plug the length of the apothem into the formula a = x√3 and solve. If the apothem's length is 5√3, for example, plug it into the formula and get 5√3 cm = x√3, or x = 5 cm.
By solving for x, you have found the length of the short leg of the triangle, 5. Since it represents half the length of one side of the hexagon, multiply it by 2 to get the full length of the side. 5 cm x 2 = 10 cm.
Now that you know that the length of one side is 10, just multiply it by 6 to find the perimeter of the hexagon. 10 cm x 6 = 60 cm

, The hardest part was finding the perimeter. Now, all you have to do is plug the apothem and perimeter into the formula and solve:


Area = 1/2 x perimeter x apothem
Area = 1/2 x 60 cm x 5√3 cm

, Simplify the expression until you've removed the radicals from the equation. State your final answer in square units.


1/2 x 60 cm x 5√3 cm =
30 x 5√3 cm =
150√3 cm =
259. 8 cm2

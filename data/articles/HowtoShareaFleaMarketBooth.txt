 If there is a contract for renting the booth space, ask if you and your partner both need to sign the document.;

Because you will be spending a lot of time together setting up your booth and selling through the duration of the flea market, this should be someone you can easily get along with. Also, because you will be handling cash transactions, the person needs to be reliable and trustworthy.
Choose a booth partner with the correct merchandise. When considering the type of merchandise you and your potential booth partner sell, it's important that your products are either complementary or unrelated. They should not be so similar that you are competing for the same customers within the same booth.
 If the spot will be divided in half, the cost can be easily split; however, if one seller is only going to have a small table or portion of an area, dividing the booth costs can prove more difficult. Be sure the costs are clear upfront to avoid any conflict later.
 Agree on who will be responsible for set-up, selling and clean-up. When working out the details for how to share a flea market booth, remember that shoppers may not realize that you are not partners. Be prepared to field questions about each other's merchandise and prices.
 A benefit to sharing a booth is additional manpower. When it's time for a meal or bathroom break, your booth partner can watch over your merchandise and take care of sales in your absence and ensure nothing is stolen. Also, a helper can lend a hand waiting on customers or wrapping and bagging merchandise if you find your booth very busy.

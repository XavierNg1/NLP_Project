ADD: Withdrawals from Savings (except new home)
LESS: Equity additions & Expenses
Cash On Hand: OVER (SHORT),Ending Balance


(Note: if you're SHORT per your Budget, you need to spend less, get a loan and/or to make more money.)

, Follow the subsection instructions for January as to whether to add all the items in a subsection (like INCOME or SAVINGS) or subtract some. Then bring the subsection total or line item down to the ANNUAL BUDGET RECAP bottom section and add or subtract accordingly -- careful, some are reversed from Savings because a contribution to Savings is a deduction from Cash on Hand, and a Withdrawal from Savings adds to Cash on Hand.
, When you have your copy, retitle it Budget. Again make another copy of the Actual sheet and title it OVER (SHORT). Subtract your Actuals from Budget to arrive at OVER (SHORT) by clicking in cell B4 of OVER (SHORT) and entering the formula, =Budget!B4-Actuals!B4.
 Clear any blank rows you may have inserted so you don't end up with cluttering zeroes.
,
They also have a supplemental trust left to them.
They have other investments and are pretty thrifty.
They own a small business they report on Schedule C of Form 1040.
They own their own home and rent out a room to also supplement their income; the tenant also does housework and cooking, etc. in lieu of cash rent.
They have recently refinanced their home to take advantage of low interest rates and to do a remodel, driveway repaving and fix the roof.
However, the refi wasn't as much as they wanted, so they've had yard sales and also sold some recreational vehicles and assets of their youth -- they're semi-retired -- and they also sold one of their two cars. They're going to either buy a smaller home or retire to a senior community -- they haven't decided which yet though.
They do have a fair retirement "nest egg" built up though, that they'd like to avoid drawing down from for as long as possible.
So now, one of them pays a friend to transport her to doctor's and dental appointments, grocery shopping, etc., and this was all worked out on a mileage basis, with amounts factored in for repairs, insurance and fees, etc.
Her husband, though working and helping her run the small business, went back to school, and will need to start paying back an educational loan this year. His employer covered most of the cost of the texts and school supplies but not the laptop or home PC he bought, which he also uses in his home business, and keeps a career library on and other professional software (which is deductible above what was reimbursed by the employer).
The couple has certain medical, visual and other physiological issues -- all deductible, as well as the transportation to and from the offices.
The couple is active politically but these expenditures are not deductible in most cases.
The couple requires assistance with certain aspects of the bookkeeping and accounting for the small business, and they also have hired a part-time production assistant, so they needed help coping with all the payroll, insurance and human resources issues as well.
The new company will operate partially over the internet via a website, which is under development, for a "one-time" fee, which is deductible.
They plan to use Excel to help budget both their business and personal financial activities, by copying these accounts to a second and third worksheet. The leftmost tab or worksheet will contain Actual amounts, the middle worksheet will contain Budget amounts, and the rightmost worksheet will compute the difference as OVER (UNDER) amounts. With this workbook, a Cash Flows worksheet, a Balance Sheet and a Profit & Loss Statement, they will have the reporting they need to not only stay on top of their business but also take all the deductions on their tax forms to which they are legally entitled, so long as they maintain their files, ledgers and receipts in good order.
You will note that, because this document is designed for people in semi-retirement, it contains many tax items faced by other people with fewer years of work behind them (but may be missing a huge item like day care), as well as addressing many of the concerns of many senior citizens.
The following is the Budget for the semi-retired couple. Note that items which have a Beginning Balance and Ending Balance have the Beginning Balance transferred over to the far right YTD column, which otherwise sums across, except for the Ending Balance line, which sums down vertically. Mostly, the Year to Date column sums across horizontally. Months April to October are filled in but hidden.

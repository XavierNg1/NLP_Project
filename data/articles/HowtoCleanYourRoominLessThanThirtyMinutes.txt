 This is optional, but if you find yourself bored easily, it may help. Just make sure you don't get distracted!
, This is usually a fairly simple task, but it can make a room look much cleaner. Consider washing your sheets if they look especially dirty.
 Pile all the clean clothes on your bed to fold later. Make sure you don't mix up your clean clothes and your dirty clothes.
 Do this neatly so that when you need them, you don't have to look everywhere.
 We will tackle this later on. You could do this by picking up the first thing that catches your eye, then do so again and again until you're finished.
 You can do this with any type of window cleaner, such as Windex. It's surprising how much fresher this can make a room feel.
 Remember that pile of things on the bed? Let's clear that up now. If anything in that pile is broken, throw it away. If there are scraps of food, throw it away. If there is stuff you don't want but is still valuable, give it to charity or a brother/sister.
 This will remove the dust, wrappers, and other stuff that is too small and tedious to pick up and throw away.
 Check under your bed and it's more than likely that you'll find long lost toys, disgusting food, and probably things that you didn't even know existed. Follow the same steps in step #6 to finish this step.
 Is there anything we missed? Is there anything we forgot to tell you? If there is, add to this article! It will help all the other people in this wonderful world!

, In the future, try to keep your room clean.

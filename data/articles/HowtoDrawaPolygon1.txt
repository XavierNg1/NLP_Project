 There are many different types of polygons. Polygons are usually classified by the number of sides they have.For example, a pentagon has five sides, a hexagon has six, and an octagon has eight. Mathematicians use the term "n-gon" to refer to a polygon with "n" sides. There is no end to the number of sides a polygon can have, and a polygon can be a simple polygon, meaning that its sides don't cross one another, or a star polygon, meaning that they do., A regular polygon is one where all the angles are equal in measure and all the sides are equal in length. While most people may think of polygons in this way, not all polygons are regular. Drawing a regular polygon is more challenging than drawing any old polygon; if you want to make one along these lines, you can learn more at How to Construct Regular Polygons Using a Circle

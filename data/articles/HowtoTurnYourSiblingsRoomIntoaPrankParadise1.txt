 Secrecy is crucial to make this work as intended. If you get caught in the act, laugh a little and explain the prank you were nabbed preparing for. Make sure that that is the ONLY prank you explain. You can't give up all of your secrets. Don't act nervous or feel guilty, because this is all for laughs. Keep your head tilted up, your brow relaxed, and pause to look amused after they start yelling at you (which they hopefully won't do- it is advised to pick a victim with a large sense or humor!). Collect your thoughts and remain calm, saying how "you thought that they would be okay with it because of their big heart" or something.
 You will need to leave the room exactly as it was before you worked your magic. Many a good prank are spoilt with messy cover ups, keen eyes, and flaring suspicions.

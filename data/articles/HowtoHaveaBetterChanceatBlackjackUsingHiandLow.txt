 Learn the basics of blackjack. You start with two cards face-up(the dealer has one face-up and face-down).You try to get close to 21 without going over it(called bust). On your turn you either choose to get another card(hit) or keep the same amount of cards(stand). After everyone is done, the dealer flips up his own card and he keeps hitting until he gets to 17 or up.;
,,,, Start laying down cards and value the pile(for example one 7, three 5's, two A's, and two 10's are worth -1)

,, And lower the value the more of a chance you get 2-6

, The book was based on his experiences working as a "big player" (BP) on Al Francesco's teams. In big-player blackjack teams a number of card counters, called "spotters", are dispatched to tables around a casino, where their responsibility is to keep track of the count and signal to the big player when the count indicates a player advantage. The big player then joins the game at that table, placing maximum bets at a player advantage. When the spotter indicates that the count has dropped, he again signals the BP to leave the table. By jumping from table to table as called in by spotters, the BP avoids all play at a disadvantage. In addition, since the BP's play appears random and irrational, he avoids detection by the casinos. The spotters, who are doing the actual counting, are not themselves changing their bet size or strategy, so they are relatively inconspicuous.

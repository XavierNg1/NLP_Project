 Set a tall pot on the stove. Secure a steamer inside of it. Your steamer may be a rack that rests across the length of the pot or a basket that sits inside the pot. As long as it can hold the crab and has holes in the bottom to let out the steam, it will cook the claws.Two-piece crab steamer pots also exist. The inner pot is the same as a steamer basket.;
, Add about three cups (710 mL) to the pot. You don’t need much water for boiling, so don’t let the water level reach the inside of the steamer. Use the bottom edge of the steamer as a guide.
 Turn up the heat under the pot. Wait for a little while for the water to boil. You may use this time to wash the crab, but stay aware of the water.
 Pass the claws under running water to remove debris. Do this for about two pounds (.45 kg) of Jonah crab claws. Drop them into the steamer., Place a lid on the pot, which will allow the steam to cook the crab faster. After about four minutes, the claws should be warm and have turned bright red with white-colored meat inside.You may steam the claws without a lid. It can take up to ten minutes for the claws to cook through, but you’ll be able to keep an eye on them., Remove the steamer from the pot. You can rinse the claws under running water or allow them to rest in the basket for a few minutes to cool them. Crack open the claws and eat the meat plain or serve it with melted butter or a cocktail sauce.

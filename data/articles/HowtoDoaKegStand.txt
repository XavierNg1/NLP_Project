 You'll feel better about the task at hand and it tests how well you tapped the keg before you put your face near it.;

 Don't worry, this is easier than it sounds because you have help. The lifters should help you get into said 'hand-stand' position by lifting the legs in an arc and guiding you up. Once there, hold steady. Once you are up, the valve operator will release the valve and hence the beer into your mouth.

 When the stop signal is given the lifter should stop counting. The lifters should then help you back into the standing position and the valve-operator should stop the flow of beer.
 You did it! Switch-up and lift for your friend!

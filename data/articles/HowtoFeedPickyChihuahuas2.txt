 Chihuahuas have a low tolerance for food that is high in preservatives, by products, and artificial coloring. Many low-quality, cheap commercial brands contain these elements. Artificial coloring and preservatives can trigger allergies and cause digestive issues.Instead, choose a high-quality commercial brand that is a little more expensive. These brands are less likely to have fillers, such as by products, and preservatives. They are more likely to have ingredients that promote health, such as chicken, fish, eggs, vegetables, and fruits.
 Another option is to make your dog homemade meals. This way, you can control what your dog eats and you can offer your Chihuahua a nutritious diet. When cooking home meals, meat should be the priority at 40%, followed by vegetables and fruit at 30%, and carbohydrates at 30%. Some of the best ingredients to use are:Organs: kidney, liver, and brain organs.
Lean meats: hamburger, white breast chicken, and fish.
Vegetables: potatoes, baby carrots, broccoli, spinach, and zucchini.
Fruits: blueberries, raspberries, and apples (make sure to remove the core).
Carbohydrates: white or brown rice, and pasta.
 Expired food could also be a reason for why your Chihuahua is being a picky eater. Therefore, always be aware of the expiration date of your dogâ€™s food. If the dog food is expired, it is time to buy a new bag of food.Stale food is also unappealing. If your dog is not finishing its meal, decrease the amount of food you put out.

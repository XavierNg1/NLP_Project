 Sitting in the same spot too often can cause the cushions to become uncomfortably soft. This will also cause one area of the sofa to collect more dirt. Instead of sitting in one spot continuously, shift where you're sitting each time you use your sofa.


If you live with family or roommates, encourage household members to do the same.
You should also limit the amount of time you spend sitting on the sofa overall. In addition to keeping your sofa more firm, moving around more often will be good for your health.
 To fluff the cushions of your couch, simply prod and poke them. This will move the stuffing around, preventing it from clumping and becoming hard. This is the same thing you would do to a bed pillow that has flattened out., If your cushions are removable, periodically flip them. You should do this every two weeks. This will help maintain the shape of your cushions and also assure both sides wear down evenly. If you don't flip your cushions regularly, one side of the cushion may become very worn down.

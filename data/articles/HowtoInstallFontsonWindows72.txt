 This is a program that lets you "create" a portable program, which will allow you to install fonts without having to have administrator access. This is great for schools or work environments where you can't bother IT every time you want to use a new font.


You can download Platform from portableapps.com/download.
 Normally, you'd need administrator access to install programs, but you can set Platform to install to your user folder so that you can bypass this restriction.
 Select your desktop, as you don't need administrator access for this personal location. You can also use your "My Documents" folder.
 Open the "PortableApps.com" folder and then the "Data" folder.
 There may already be a Fonts folder. If there isn't, right-click and select "New" â†’ "Folder". Name the folder "Fonts".
 You can copy and paste them or click and drag them from your Downloads folder.


Only download fonts from trusted locations. If you intend to use the fonts for commercial purposes, they must be licensed for free use.
 Restart Platform as soon as it closes.
 Your new fonts should now appear in any program that supports new fonts. You can add new fonts to the Fonts folder in the Platform directory whenever you want to add more.

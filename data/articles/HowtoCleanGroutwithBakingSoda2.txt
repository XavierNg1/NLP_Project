 In a bowl, combine two parts baking soda to one part hydrogen peroxide. Mix the ingredients together to form a paste that can be easily applied to the grout., Again, you can apply your cleaning paste with the same brush youâ€™ll use to scrub the grout later. Specialty grout brushes can be purchased at home improvement stores, but you can also use other stiff-bristled scrub brushes, a sponge with a scouring side, or an old toothbrush., Give the paste up to five minutes to soak into the grime. This should make scrubbing out tough stains, including mold and mildew, easier., Use your brush to work the cleaner into the grout. You should see the stains begin to lift. Continue to scrub any stains by hand until they are removed., Use paper towels to pick up excess paste and any grime removed from it. Substitute in old rags if you wish to avoid wasting paper., Optionally, mop the floor as you usually do. This will remove any dirt and paste you missed as well as give your floor a nice shine. For grout you cannot reach by mop, dampen a rag in clean water and wipe.

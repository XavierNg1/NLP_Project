 You usually won't be able to tell whether or not a contact has blocked you by sending a text message, so you'll need to call them., If the call ends after one ring (or, in some cases, half of a ring) and you are diverted to voicemail, you are either blocked or your contact's phone is dead.Depending on your contact's carrier, you might hear a message telling you that the contact can't be reached. This generally applies to AT&T and Sprint, and it means you have been blocked.Of course, if the contact answers your call, you haven't been blocked.
 Sometimes a call will divert to voicemail even if the line is clear and your phone unblocked; calling again will confirm the call's ending.


If your call still ends after a ring or less and diverts to voicemail, your contact's phone is definitively dead or blocking your calls.
 You can do this by typing "*67" before their phone number. While you can't feasibly expect anyone to pick up a call from a restricted number, calling in this way will verify the contact's phone status:


If the call goes through like usual--e.g., five or more rings--then your contact has blocked your number.
If the call still stops after a ring or less and diverts to voicemail, your contact's phone is dead.
 If you've determined that you're blocked but would like verbal confirmation, you can ask a friend to call your contact and talk to them about the situation. Keep in mind that, as tempting as this may be, doing so might harm your friend's relationship with the contact who blocked you.

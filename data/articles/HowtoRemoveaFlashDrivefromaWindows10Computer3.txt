 Quick Removal is a Windows service that formats your flash drive for a no-eject removal, meaning you can simply unplug the flash drive when you're done with it. To enable Quick Removal, your flash drive must currently be plugged in.


You can't set up Quick Removal for an SD card.
 It's the Windows logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Doing so will invoke a pop-up menu.


You can also hold down âŠž Win and tap X to bring up the pop-up menu.
 This option is toward the top of the pop-up menu.
 The Disk Drives section is toward the top of the Device Manager window. Clicking the arrow to the left of it reveals the list of your computer's disk drives, which happens to include your currently attached flash drive.
 The flash drive's name will vary, but you will usually see "USB" in its title.
 This option is at the bottom of the right-click drop-down menu.
 It's a tab at the top of the "Properties" window.
 It's near the top of this window.
 This will enable Quick Removal for this specific flash drive. When you're done using the flash drive, you can physically remove it from your computer without going through the "Eject" process.

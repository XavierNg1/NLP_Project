 Download your skin .png file.
 Close your internet connection.
 Search for "%appdata%" and go to "/Roaming/.minecraft/versions" and choose the version you want.
 Open that folder and find the .jar file (may be executable). You will need winRAR to open this file.
 Copy and then delete the meta.inf file. Put the copy somewhere safe, where you won't lose it.
 Go to "assests/minecraft/textures/entity" and rename the image "steve" into "steveZERO".


You don't want to delete the file because if you want to play online, Minecraft will crash.
 Rename the image you downloaded to "steve" (so that it matches the file name of the original Steve skin), and place it in that same location (entity folder).
 Close the folders and start the game.
 You will see yourself there! Just remember: This skin just works offline and if you go online it doesn't work. The holes in your skin will appear black on multiplayer. This is because people can cheat in games by blanking their skin and making it invisible.

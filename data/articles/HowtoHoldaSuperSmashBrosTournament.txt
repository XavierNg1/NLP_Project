 Plan out which game you're using (it could be 64, Melee, Brawl, or even a fan hack such as Project M or Brawl Plus), the rules of the tournament, where the tournament will be held, the time and date of the tournament, the tournament's structure, and the prizes for winning.;
, At the very least, you'll need the console and game, controllers (you'll only need two to four at a time, though you may want more as backup in case a controller breaks), and a television.
 You can advertise it on social media, through fliers, or anything else. If you're using fliers, be sure that your flier looks attractive so that people will notice it. Be sure that you explain how to enter the tournament.
 It's a good idea to provide food and drink so that people don't get hungry or thirsty. Plus, it may make people more likely to attend your tournament.
 You want everything ready before the tournament starts.
 Whether it's a tournament that's serious or just for fun, the most important thing is to have fun. Once the tournament is over and the victor(s) have been decided, give out the prizes.

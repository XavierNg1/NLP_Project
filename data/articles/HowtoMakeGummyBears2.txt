 Making candy is as much science as art. To get perfect, store-boat texture and taste in your gummies you'll need a few harder-to-find ingredients as well as high-end gelatin (known as 250 bloom). Most ingredients are weighed out to prevent measurement errors instead of being scooped. Weigh them out in advance and have them on hand to be quickly mixed in -- timing in candy making is key.


70g Gelatin, 250 bloom
140g Water
225g Sugar
22.5g Sorbitol Powder
245g Glucose syrup
15g Tartaric acid, or citric
12g Essential Oil, any flavor

, You can mix them together with a whisk or, like classic candy makers, in a water bath. To do the second, warm a large bowl of water up so that it is hot, but not boiling. Mix the 70g gelatin and 140g water in a Ziplock bag and let it rest in the water bath for 30 minutes.









The bag should be free of lumps or streaks when it is fully mixed.
 Stir the ingredients well so that they're properly mixed up, but not boiling or bubbling. If you have a candy thermometer, get them to 150 degrees Fahrenheit.
 With the heat still on, mix in the gelatin and water mixture from earlier. Stir until it is all completely mixed, then turn the heat off and move quickly to the next step.
 This might be essential oils, like cherry, citrus, etc, or tartaric/citric acid for sourness. You can also add 1/3 cup of well pureed-fruit like strawberries, or fresh lemon, lime, or orange juice.









This is also the time to add any food coloring., You can use a light coating of cornstarch to prevent them final gummies from sticking, but many gummy-making pans are already non-stick. Simply pour the mixture into the mold then freeze for 4-5 hours, or until the gummies are firm and completely set.

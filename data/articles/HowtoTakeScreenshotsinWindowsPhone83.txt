 You can capture anything on your screen, from a game to a video.
 You'll hear a click when the screenshot has been captured, and the screen will flash. This was changed to allow devices not made by Microsoft to take screenshots in Windows Phone 8.1.Note: This also works for Windows 10 Mobile.
 Like in Windows Phone 8, your screenshots are saved to the "Screenshots" album in your Photos app. Connect the phone to your computer to sync the screenshots.

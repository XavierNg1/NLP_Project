 Plans are subject to change for many reasons. Create alternative plans in case their chosen profession doesn’t work out for some reason. Alternate plans in the same field, or a closely related field, are less costly and more time efficient. This way your child is well prepared if their chosen profession doesn’t work out as planned.


Your child might be interested in becoming a physician. It is a good idea to also come up with alternate plans in the same field. They could also become a high school biology teacher or a nurse.
 Understand the prerequisites needed to be accepted into that educational or training program. It is also important to know the costs of the education or training and develop a plan to pay for or finance it. It might be a good idea to ask people who are currently training in that field and talk to them about what their day to day life is like.Schedule a college visit with your child or take your child to see a vocational training program.
 Networking and experience are just as important as education and training. There are several ways to gain experience and contacts in a particular field including volunteering, shadowing, and internships. Explain to your child that the more leadership they take, paid or unpaid, the more seriously they will be taken in the future by employers.


Teens should start building their resume as early as possible.

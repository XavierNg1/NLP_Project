 If you have met his family, think back on how their interactions were. If you have not met them, perhaps he has spoken to them on the phone while you were around. If he is kind and loving with them, then you likely have a good man on your hands. However, if he is harsh, be careful.Before you judge, however, know at least some of his history with his family. For instance, if they have been abusive or neglectful in the past, this could explain why he is cold to them.
 If you are serious about this boyfriend, plan some time for him to meet your family. Bring him over for Sunday dinner or invite him to go to a family event with you. Notice how he interacts with your family, if he is friendly or more reserved or if he is rude. Ask your family what they thought of him later.
 In addition to learning more about your boyfriend, allow your friends to do so, as well. They will often pick up on things that you might not notice. Go out to dinner with him and some of your friends or out bowling. Ask them what they thought of him soon after.


For instance, your boyfriend might have done something nice for your friend while you were in the restroom that they will want to tell you about.

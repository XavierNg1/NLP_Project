In another separate bowl, pour in the rice flour., The chicken should be cut into bite-size pieces. First, cover the pieces in the rice flour. Then, dip the chicken in the eggs. Last, thoroughly coat the chicken in the cereal crumbs.Put each piece of coated chicken onto a large plate until you are ready to cook them. Do not stack the pieces on top of each other.

Begin to add the nuggets to the skillet., Cook each side of the chicken for 2 or 3 minutes. The juice running from the chicken should be clear, and the inside should no longer be pink when the nuggets are finished. Serve warm with the dipping sauce of your choice.

 The electric bunching technique is easy to form but hard to predict. After dyeing the fabric, you should be left with several "shocks" of color dispersed at random through the cloth., You'll want to do so in small, random portions. Use one hand to hold your bunch together so they do not come loose and then draw the entire piece of fabric together into the shape of a ball. Keep as much of the cloth "face," or outer side of the fabric, exposed as possible.
 With one hand, hold the ball of fabric together. With your free hand, wrap several rubber bands around it to hold it together. You could also use twine or string to fasten your ball together, but in both cases, fasten your ball loosely.


Fastening your ball too tightly can make it difficult for the dye to work its way into the core of the bunched fabric. This can create gaps in your dyed design. Use the minimum number of fasteners secured as loose as possible while still retaining the ball's shape.
If you plan on using twine or string, it may be easiest to have a friend help you hold the bunched fabric while you tie, or vice versa. If no friends are available, lay of the string on the surface, set your ball atop the middle of the string while still holding the ball together with one hand, cross the ends of the string at the top of your ball, and use your free hand to tie a simple knot.

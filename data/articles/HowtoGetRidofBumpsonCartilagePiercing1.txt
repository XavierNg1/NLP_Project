 Shake a quarter to a half a tablespoon of coarse sea salt into a shallow bowl, then pour in about eight ounces of water. Stir the mixture together until the salt is completely dissolved. You can use this salt water solution to clean and soothe the pain of an irritated piercing.The water should be warm enough to dissolve all of the salt without leaving behind any small particles.
Give the salt water a taste to make sure it’s the right strength—it shouldn’t be much saltier than your tears.;
, Dip the cotton ball into the salt water and make sure it’s thoroughly saturated. Shake off the excess solution, but don’t wring out the cotton ball. There needs to be enough water moisture to seep into your skin below the surface.For especially small or hard to reach bumps, try using a cotton swab instead.
 The warmth of the water will promote blood flow and decrease swelling, while the salt dries and shrinks the size of the bump. Apply enough pressure to the bump to keep the cotton ball in place, but not so much that it’s uncomfortable.Salt is naturally good for killing germs, so it will also help sterilize the piercing as a bonus.Your skin may be a little dry after the salt soaks, but resist the urge to use a lotion or moisturizer. These products may just make the irritation worse.
 Soak painful, enlarged bumps twice a day until they begin to show signs of improvement. After each treatment, rinse your ear with warm water and a gentle antibacterial soap. This will remove any traces of salt and keep germs from building up around the piercing.Space out your soaks so that you’re doing one in the morning and one later in the evening or just before you go to bed.
If the bump isn’t looking better after about a week, schedule an appointment with a dermatologist.

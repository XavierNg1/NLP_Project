 First, select the den you want to do it in. Enchanted hollows, Treehouses, Volcanoes, and even Fantasy castles work well providing they have Spiderweb flooring, Night sky wallpaper, and Sol Arcade Music;
, Now that you have your den, you need to decorate it. Put a Space Ship Command (in Epic Wonders for 5,000 gems) for Mission Control/Command Center, speakers to hear transmissions, and chairs. You also might want to use a Rectangular Coffee Table, and a laptop (to study and record). Also: use a Full Moon Window (from the Wolves Only Party), and make a lounge room. After all, being an astronaut and practically living in space sure is hard work! And to decorate the walls and floors: Use Lava/Coral Canyons floors, and of course Starry Walls.
 Once you're all set, dress like an astronaut or transmitter. To be an astronaut: Be white, with any color Astronaut Helmet and Camouflage Boots. To be a transmitter: Wear any color Tuxedo Jacket and Headphones (to speak to fellow workers). Then, head out to Jamaa Township and advertise. Dance or play and say things like, "SPACE SHUTTLE MY DEN! Workers needed, please come!" or "Jamaa Space Exploration at my den, grand opening!" Once you think you've advertised enough, go back to your den and see if anyone's there.
 Do background checks, assign their rank and job, and tell them what missions are going on (if any), what they will do in the missions, and what missions may come in the future.
 Most importantly, have fun in your new shuttle!

 Before you go, call your friends and tell them you're leaving right now.
 Don't forget to take the shopping list that you copied if you don't have yours at this moment.
 See who can get all the items the fastest. If you're not allowed running around a big store by yourself then play school supply basketball! Throw it in the basket/cart or if it's breakable just gently place it in.

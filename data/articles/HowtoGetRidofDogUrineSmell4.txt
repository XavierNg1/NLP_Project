 If your dog is not getting walked frequently enough, they may feel the need to relieve themselves in the house. Ensure you are taking your dog out to pee at least four times a day, but more frequently if your dog is very old, young or infirm. If need be, hire a dog walker to come by your home so you can meet your dog’s needs., Some dogs, whether due to a lack of training as puppies or past abuse, never get properly trained to use the bathroom outside. If you suspect this may be the case of your dog, particularly if your dog has an unknown history, call a dog trainer. Many trainers do in-home sessions that can address your dog’s specific problem behaviors.Trainers can also diagnose whether your dog’s urination in the house may be due to an underlying behavioral issue such as separation anxiety.
 If your dog’s urination problems persist despite walking your dog frequently and employing a trainer, you may want to take them to the vet. Some health problems, such as neutering complications or urinary tract infections, can cause your dog to pee more frequently, including inside the house.Make a note of where your dog goes in the house, how often, and when your issues started so you can relate them to your veterinarian.
 Certain repellent products, such as Four Paws Keep Off! and Nature’s Miracle Pet Block Repellent, can discourage your dog from urinating in the house. Test your materials for colorfastness, and then spray the repellant thoroughly on the area your dog urinates.

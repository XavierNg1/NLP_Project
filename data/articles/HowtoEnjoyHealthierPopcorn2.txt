 Add 1 teaspoon (5 g) melted unsalted butter and ¼ teaspoon (1 ml) of hot water to a clean spray bottle. Shake the bottle vigorously to mix the two together.The water doesn’t need to be boiling. Hot water from the tap is warm enough.
Don’t substitute margarine for the butter. It had a tendency to clump up so it won’t spray well.
 Take 8 cups (64 g) of plain, air-popped popcorn, and place it on a cookie sheet. Be sure to lay the popcorn out in a single layer.You can also spread the popcorn out on a large piece of foil.
 Once the popcorn is spread out, lightly spray it with the butter and water mixture. Be sure to spray evenly so the butter flavor is evenly distributed. Transfer the popcorn to a bowl, and serve.You can sprinkle some salt over the popcorn after you spray it. However, don’t use too much or the popcorn will have too much sodium.
You can also sprinkle the popcorn with a lighter seasoning after spraying it for extra flavor.

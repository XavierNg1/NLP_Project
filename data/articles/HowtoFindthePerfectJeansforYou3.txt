 Different designers size their jeans in different ways, which means that your size may fluctuate between brands. Moreover, every designer has a different idea about how styles should look. One pair of flare jeans may only flare out a little, while another pair from a separate designer may flare out a great deal.
 Try on as much as you can and study yourself in the dressing room mirror to get a thorough idea of what reflects your personal style and flatters you most.
 Think about where you normally like to go and what you normally want to do. Are you more active in your jeans? Do you only wear jeans with a pair of ankle boots and a fancy top? Do you constantly alternate between dressing up and dressing down your jeans? Consider where you wear your jeans and what you typically do while you’re wearing them to decide which styles to gravitate towards.

Walk around.
Jump up and down.
Sit down.
Bend over.
 Some brands cost more than others. Know your budget before you shop, and pay attention to the price tag on a pair of jeans before you try them on and get too attached.

 Photographs can be damaged from exposure to water, sunlight, heat, and moisture in the air. Humidity can cause photographs to stick together, while high temperatures cause photographs to become very brittle. Store your photographs in an environment that has low humidity, is not exposed to direct sunlight, and does not experience extreme temperature fluctuations. Ideally, the temperature should be below 75Â° Fahrenheit.Do not store photos in a hot attic or in a garage or basement where the images may come into contact with water. Keep your photographs in a temperature-controlled section of the house, like a bedroom or hallway closet.
 Archival boxes and albums provide a safe environment for your photographs that keep out humidity, pests, and dust. You can find these items from online vendors and from a stationery or office supply shop. When browsing for archival boxes or albums, be sure that they are intended for photo storage and are free from acid and PVC, or polyvinyl chloride.Place a silica gel packet in the box to help offset any excess moisture.
 If an album or storage box is packed to the brim with photos, it may not close properly, leaving the photos susceptible to environmental damage. A box that is not filled enough may also cause damage to the photographs. When there are only a few items in the container, the images may slide around, causing damage to the edges. Be sure that the photographs are secure and that the storage bin can properly close.

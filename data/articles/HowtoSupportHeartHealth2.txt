 Even if you're eating healthy foods, you can damage your heart health by eating too much (or too little!). To eat proper portions, pay attention to your hunger. Start yourself off with small servings, and only return for seconds if you don't feel sated.Consider the size of your plates. The bigger the plate, the more likely you are to over-serve yourself. Purchase small plates and bowls to encourage small serving sizes.
Serve yourself the low-calorie healthy foods first. Fill half your plate with salad and vegetables before you go for the heavier items.
 You are more likely to make healthy choices if you plan your meals ahead of time. On the weekends, or whenever you have time off work, make menus and plan your week out in advance. Make a grocery list of everything you'll need before you shop, and beware of impulse purchases.Try cooking ahead for yourself so you don't have to stop and cook every meal. Make food so that there will be leftovers, and keep track of when you made them so things don't go bad.
Balance your weekly diet so that you don't eat too much of the same thing all at once. Try making two to three main dishes at a time so that you can alternate.
 Stressing out about your food choices will not support your heart's health. As long as it's not a daily habit, it's okay to eat the occasional handful of chips or slice of birthday cake.However, once it is a habit, try to control and alter it as soon as possible. For instance, you may choose not to keep chips in the house if you're always reaching for them.
If you eliminate one unhealthy snack, try to replace it with something healthier that you like â€” for instance, if you get rid of chips, try keeping some nuts or cut-up vegetables around for snacking.

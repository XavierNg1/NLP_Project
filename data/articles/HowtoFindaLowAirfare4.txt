 It’s often cheaper to buy an air/hotel package rather than airfare alone. By “cheaper”, this means that the total package with hotel is often less than the airfare without the hotel component.


Site59.com is the online leader in this field. Travelocity owns Site59, so you’ll often see “TotalTrip” options on Travelocity just above the airfare-only search results. Don’t ignore these deals! Usually, they work best only if there are two of you traveling, since the hotels are based on double occupancy. They’re especially useful for last minute travel.
Tour operators and your local travel agent also sell packages that might save you money, although not necessarily on last minute deals.

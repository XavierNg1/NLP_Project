 You can use a brioche recipe, canned dough, or a pizza mix. Follow the directions on the package or the recipe.;
, This will keep the dough from sticking, and make your job much easier. Be careful to not get flour everywhere!

, Separate these pieces, and place three off to the side, leaving one in front of you.
 Use a medium sized plate, unless you are making a GIANT star bread. Do the same with the other pieces. Use the same plate.
 You can also take some out into a bowl and microwave it in a safe bowl for 10 seconds (depending on your microwave).
 Of course, you could use the commercially available Nutella spoon, but a knife will work just as well, if not better.
 Repeat this process until you have used all your pieces. You can try to have more layers, but four work the best. Carefully transfer it to a baking sheet.
 First, divide it into fourths (1/4), then divide each of those in half (1/8), then divide each of those in half (1/16).
 Pair each piece with another, and twist one clockwise, and the other counterclockwise. Flatten out the edges slightly.  You can see it's starting to take shape now.
 Going around, take the pairs that are twisted the opposite way and stick the ends together.
, Following the directions on your oven, heat it until it is warm enough.
 Using a brush, sponge or other spreader, put a very thin coat of the egg whites.
 When it is nice and golden, take it out.
 This recipe is great for sharing, and can serve 5-9 people.

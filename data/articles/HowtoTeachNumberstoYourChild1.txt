 The first step in learning numbers is hearing numbers and remembering their order. The numbers one through ten are important to learn first. In order to help facilitate this process, begin counting toys and pieces of food with your baby when they’re about a year old.For instance, count their blueberries out loud as they eat them. Simply say, “One blueberry, two blueberries, three blueberries, four…”
Similarly, count as you put away their toys together. For instance, “We put one block away, now two blocks, three blocks…”;
, There are all sorts of number songs you can find online and sing with your child. You can even make up your own counting songs. The more playful and memorable, the better.For instance, sing, “Five enormous dinosaurs, letting out a roar, one went away, and then there were four,” while playing with your child and their toys. Continue with, “Four enormous dinosaurs, crashing down a tree, one went away, and then there were three,” and so on.
Rhythm and rhyming helps children remember numbers and their order.
Be sure to go from 1 to 10 and from 10 to 1 in different songs.
 Another great way to expose your child to numbers is by reading them books that contain numbers. There are countless examples available for purchase online or from your local library.Examples of recommended counting books include Eric Carle's "1, 2, 3 to the Zoo: A Counting Book" and Jane Yolen's "How Do Dinosaurs Count to Ten?"

, While saying or singing numbers or number songs, use items or your fingers to provide a visual indication of each number. This will help your child learn what each number represents and begin to help them recognize the concept that some numbers are more or less than other numbers.

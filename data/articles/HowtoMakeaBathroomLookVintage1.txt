, Like detached tubs, detached pedestal sinks recall an era before the widespread use of indoor plumbing. Select a curvy design to give your bathroom a Victorian look or a straight-edged, boxy design if you want to give your bathroom a Craftsman look, which is the style that immediately followed the Victorian era. If you don't want to lose storage space, consider retrofitting an antique dresser into a bathroom vanity.
 The earliest toilets did not have a built-in tank. Instead, the tank and the bowl were separate, and the tank usually hung on the wall high about the wall. The handle was attached to the tank by a long metal chain.
 Chrome and other shiny metals tend to create a modern ambiance. For a vintage style, opt for dull metals instead, like copper, wrought iron, nickel, and oiled bronze.

 You do not need a separate room in your house, but space for a desk and a computer is necessary.


Find a place that is free from distractions. It will be hard to work from a desk in front of the television, or surrounded by children and pets.
 Most of your work will be done online, so accessing websites and email quickly is essential.
 An all-in-one printer, copier and scanner will be helpful when you need to print and scan documents for clients.


Buy other equipment and supplies that will make your work more efficient. You might want a fax machine, a land line telephone and a variety of files and folders to keep your printed materials. Have pens, pencils, envelopes and other office supplies available.
 It might be necessary to send an email or schedule a meeting while you are away from your office. You need to be mobile.

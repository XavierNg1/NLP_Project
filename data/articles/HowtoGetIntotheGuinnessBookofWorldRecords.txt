 Some records are easier to break than others. Do you have an unusual type of body? Are you particularly good at a certain talent? Even your huge collection of comics could be a record breaker! Records in the GWR (Guinness Book of World Records) book have been beaten tons of times. Look in the book and see if there's a record you think you could beat.;
, They have an "APPLY NOW" section where you can write what type of record you are interested in. You will probably have to wait a very long time until you get a reply (it could be longer than three months). Remember, there are hundreds of people just like you who want to break a record.
 Make sure you read through them carefully.
, Get a camera or video camera and film the entire thing. Whatever this thing may be. But don't let the witnesses leave right after that! You'll need them to sign witness statements.
, And if your record was impressive and cool enough, then they'll put it in the Guinness book of world records!

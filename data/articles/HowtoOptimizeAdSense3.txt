 While you canâ€™t control every aspect of the ads, there are some things you can do.


While the most popular link color is blue, you may find that more people click on the ads if you use a link color that matches the other links on your Web site.



Some AdSense users recommend using no border around ads when you use a light-colored background. When you use a darker background, the consensus is to border your ads.
Additionally, using borders for in-text ads can distract visitors, while bordering ads on the sides of your page can draw positive attention to the ads.

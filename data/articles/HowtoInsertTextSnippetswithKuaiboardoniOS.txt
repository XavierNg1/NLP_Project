 Locate the app on your iPhone or iPad and tap on it.


If you don’t have KuaiBoard yet, you can download it from the App Store. Once installed, enable it by going to Settings >> General >> Keyboard >> Add New Keyboard. Select KuaiBoard, and then tap on KuaiBoard – KuaiBoard under the existing keyboards section.;
, A text editor screen will come out.
 At the top of the text editor screen is the Label field. Type in the name of the text clip here.
 It can be just a single phrase or several sentences or lines.
 It’s now ready for use, and it will be added to the list of text clips available under the All Text Clips menu.
 For example, the Messages app or the Mail app.
 Your default keyboard will appear.
 Stop when KuaiBoard appears. You will know as your keyboard will be replaced by the text clips or snippets you created.


All available text clips or snippets will be displayed as part of the keyboard. The space for the keyboard may get expanded up to accommodate the text clips or snippets.
 The contents of the text clip or snippet will immediately be pasted on your message or text editor.


You can switch between KuaiBoard and an ordinary keyboard by tapping on the world icon, in case you need to type something outside the text clips or snippets.

 Try to make friends with people that make you feel good, but keep in mind that difficult conversations within relationships are sometimes necessary. However, if you frequently feel unwelcome or unappreciated around someone, do not try to build a friendship with them. You are under no obligation to befriend anyone who makes you feel bad.Ask yourself after having spent time with someone “Did I enjoy myself?” If the answer is yes, spend more time with them. If the answer is no, spend less time with them.
 Sometimes old friends change, or we change and they remain the same. When this happens, your old friend may make you feel bad. This can range anywhere from feeling guilty about your success to being uncomfortable with the situations you end up in with that friend. When this happens, you should let go of that friendship and allow yourself to move on to friendships that better fit your needs.For example, you might tell your college friend “I know we used to have a lot of fun partying, but now I have responsibilities that I take seriously. I am not interested in living the same lifestyle that you live.”
If a friend is engaging in irresponsible behavior without acknowledging a need to change, then it may be time to let go of that friendship.
 People abuse relationships in many ways. Your friend might constantly borrow money off of you and never pay it back, they might call at all hours of the night for emotional support but never answer your calls, or they might be physically abusive. Regardless of the type of abuse or manipulation, friendships aren’t meant to operate this way. Both sides should be giving and receiving emotional and other support.If you are being abused or manipulated, you likely won’t enjoy the time you spend with that friend anyway.

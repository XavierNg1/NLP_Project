 The most important element of a diet aimed at building muscle is protein. Aim for about 1.7-1.8 grams (0.06 oz.) of protein for every kilogram (pound) you weigh. Get this protein from lean meats such as chicken and fish, or vegetables like peas, hemp, or spinach., In order to make your protein consumption effective, eat it soon after you work out. This will allow the protein to target and build up the muscles you’ve just worked out., Don’t undereat! You’re working out and sweating, which means you need lots of nutrition. The average woman should get about 2,000 calories per day. If you want to cut that number down, keep track of signs that you’re not eating enough, such as:Fatigue
Low motivation for workouts
Extreme soreness after workouts
Increased moodiness and/or depression

, Not all carbs are bad! Carbohydrates are actually a key source for the production of insulin and glycogen, both critical to your health. Get carbs from healthy sources such as whole-grain rice and pasta and quinoa.While there’s no precise amount of carbs needed for bodybuilding, start with about 3 grams (0.11 oz.) per kilogram (pound) per day. Adjust this number by listening to body, checking your energy levels, and monitoring any weight gain or loss.
 Fats that come from unprocessed foods are critical to your overall nutrition. Eat eggs, nuts, and avocados to add these essential fats to your diet., Many bodybuilders take a daily powder supplement of whey protein. Taking this supplement in moderate, recommended amounts can aid weight loss while also promoting the building of lean muscle.Be sure to follow the instructions for dosage. If you take very high doses of whey protein, you could experience nausea, stomach pains or cramps, headaches, and fatigue.
Protein supplements aren’t necessary for bodybuilding, and they can’t replace natural sources of protein.

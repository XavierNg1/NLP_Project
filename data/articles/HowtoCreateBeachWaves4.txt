 If you have curly or frizzy hair, you simply need to elongate your existing curls. To do so, get your hair slightly damp. Wash your hair as you normally would and pat it dry with a towel until it's damp., The right styling products for frizzy or curly hair vary by your hair type. Choose a styling product that generally smooths out your curls and allows you to mold your hair. You can try things like mousse, gel, or hairspray. Apply about four pumps of any given product to your damp hair.If you don't normally use hair product, you may have to experiment with several different styling products before finding one that works for your hair type.
 Gently massage the product into your hair. Pull your hair downward as you go, stretching out your curls into long waves. Keep massaging and stretching out your hair until you have long, casual beach-like curls., Do not dry your hair if it's frizzy or curly. This can cause your beach waves to come undone. Instead, let your hair air dry to so the beach waves set.

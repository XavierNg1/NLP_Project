 A health professional should be able to give you detail about the particular birth defect your baby has and can refer you to important resources for babies with birth defects. He or she will also have to make preparations to be able to properly care for your child.


Your obstetrician or the pediatrician may refer you and the baby to a surgical, gastrointestinal, heart, or nervous system specialist to learn more about the condition or coordinate treatment for the baby.
Most physicians will be able to answer your questions about the likely severity of the birth defect, the likely adaptations you will have to perform to make life comfortable and safe for your child, and what to expect in terms of caring for the baby.
Most physicians can refer you to programs that may help cover treatment costs, education expenses, and other unanticipated changes in living costs.;
, Every birth defect – from Down syndrome to congenital heart defects to Spina bifida – has a significant body of research and information compiled online and in medical publications.


Read only information on birth defects from credible sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control, the March of Dimes, or the National Library of Medicine.
Do not expect that you will remember and understand everything you initially read on your baby’s birth defect. It will take time to learn the ins and outs of the condition and the details on management and care for your child.

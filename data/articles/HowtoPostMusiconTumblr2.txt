 Tumblr has partnered with Spotify and SoundCloud to make some of their music libraries free for your blogging use. Simply enter the song and/or artist name into the search bar and select the file that you want.


All of the files that come up are by artists who have agreed to let others post their music for non-commercial purposes through Spotify or SoundCloud, so you won't be held responsible for any copyright infringement allegations. Spotify compensates artists for the license to let others use their music, and SoundCloud artists can decide how they would like to protect their music when they upload it.;

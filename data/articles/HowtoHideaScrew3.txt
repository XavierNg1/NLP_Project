 If necessary, mark the location where you need to drive your screw. Take a 14 mm chisel and place it about 1.5 cm away from your mark with the bevel facing down. Curl up a thin strip of wood until the strip is about 5 cm in length., Attach a twist to your drill with the same diameter as your screw shank. Drill a pilot hole for your screw under the curled strip of wood. Then drive your screw so it’s flush with the wood surface under the curled strip., Apply carpenter’s glue to both pieces, and use a bit more if your curled edge incurred any splits or cracks when you chiseled it.Clamp the curled edge to the surface and let it dry for about 60 minutes.Place a piece of scrap wood between your project’s surface and the clamp. Tape over the surface of the scrap piece that comes into contact with your project to avoid sticking.  

, Use medium to fine grit sandpaper to finish your project. Letting the area dry for 60 minutes should leave you with dry but slightly tacky glue. That way, when you sand it, the dust and glue will combine to fill any cracks and further hide your work.

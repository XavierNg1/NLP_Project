 It is Misty, so be ready for a Staryu and Starmie.;
, Charmander would not be a good choice, as Misty is a water Pokémon trainer. It is an obvious type of disadvantage. Did you pick up a Pikachu in the Viridian forest? If you did, this gym will be easy; water conducts electricity. For pickers of Bulbasaur, this one will be easy as well.
 The higher they are, the better.
 Outside of Mt. Moon you may have noticed two people. One teaches your Pokémon Mega Punch, the other Mega Kick. These are great moves to use against Misty.
 Be sure to make full use of the mega moves, especially if using Charmander.

 Using a search engine, find "download program for MySpace music"


Some examples of good download programs include: FreeMusicZilla, Audacity and Musicjacker. For this article, we will download a song using Musicjacker.
 Musicjacker currently offers a free trial, but to download several songs you have to purchase the $4.99 full download.
 Once you've installed the program and opened it, you'll see two tabs at the top of the screen - Musicjacker and Musicscraper. Musicjacker is the tab you'll use to download music from Myspace.
 Beneath the Musicjacker tab is a search bar with a globe at the left. This is the Media Finder. Paste the address of the artist's Myspace page into the Media Finder and click Find Music.
 The Media Finder will bring up a window listing all the songs on that webpage. Check the ones you want and click Download.


Listen to a song before downloading. You can double-check that Media Finder has listed the songs you want by double-clicking on an item.
 In the large white box, you'll see the song pop up and begin to download. When the percentage bar on the right reaches 100%, the download is complete. You can highlight the item and click Clear to remove it from the queue.


Change where your songs go. The Output Path beneath the download box indicates where your downloads are going. Unless you specify otherwise, Musicjacker should send files to C:\Users\\Documents\Music. Click the Options button to put files in a different location.

 These cylinders are the centrifuges. The centrifuges are assembled in both series and parallel layouts.
 The centrifuges use centripetal acceleration to send the heavier 238U-bearing gas to the cylinder wall and the lighter 235U-bearing gas to the center.
, The 235U-rich gases are sent to a centrifuge where still more 235U is extracted, while the 235U-depleted gas goes to a different centrifuge to extract still more of the remaining 235U. This enables the centrifuge process to extract much more 235U than the gaseous diffusion process can.The gas centrifuge process was first developed in the 1940s, but was not brought into significant use until the 1960s, when its lower energy requirements for producing enriched uranium became important.At present, a gas centrifuge processing plant exists in the United States in Eunice, New Mexico.In contrast, Russia currently has four such plants, Japan and China have two each, while the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany each have one.

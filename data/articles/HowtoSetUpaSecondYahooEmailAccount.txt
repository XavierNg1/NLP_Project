 Visit Yahoo Mail from any web browser on your computer.;
, Enter your Yahoo ID, or username, and password into the fields provided. Click the “Sign In” button, and you will be signed into your Yahoo Mail.
 Click the gear button on the upper right corner of Yahoo Mail. This will bring down a menu. Click on “Settings” from here. The Settings window will appear, and all of the settings menu or options can be found on the left panel.
 The settings for Accounts will load on the right panel.
 Look for the “Extra email address” option and click the “Create an extra email address” link. A new tab or window will open for the “Create an extra email address” page.
 Type in the email address you want for your second email address. No need to input “@yahoo.com” as this is automatically given. Click “Check Availability” right under the field to check if your email address is still available. If it’s unavailable, try another email address. You can use characters from a-z, 0-9, underscores, and a single dot.


Be sure you’re comfortable with the second address you’ve entered. You can only change this second email address twice within 12 months. This is Yahoo’s policy to prevent spam.
 Before Yahoo Mail creates your second email address, it needs to verify that you’re not a robot.
 You will be brought to a verification page where you will be shown a random sequence of characters. Input these characters into the text field, and click the “OK” button below.


Be sure to enter the characters as how you see it.
 Once Yahoo Mail finishes creating your second email address, you will see a confirmation page. Click “OK.”


You can now use the second email address, just like how you use your primary one.

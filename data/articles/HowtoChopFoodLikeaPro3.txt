 If you're just learning to chop, the cross chop is a great and safe technique. Place the food you want to chop on your cutting board and hold your chef's knife with your dominant hand. Open your subordinate hand and lay the palm where it meets the fingers on top of the blade. Keep your fingers open and out while the other hand rocks the blade to roughly chop the food. Continue to chop the food until it's the size you want.








The cross chop is good for chopping foods that will cook down, since the pieces may not be uniform.
 If you'd chop something into slices, hold the item steady with the thumb of your subordinate hand. Extend your fingers towards the end of the food where you'll begin slicing. Curl those fingertips in to protect them from the blade. Raise the blade straight up and bring it straight back down to make a slice. Continue to slowly bring the blade up and tap it back down as you walk your fingertips back.








Keep your thumb away from the blade and continue to hold the food steady.
You won't be rocking the blade as you tap chop.
 To finely chop or mince fresh herbs or small items (like garlic), chop the food for a few seconds, so it's roughly chopped. Gather the food together and lay the fingertips of your subordinate hand on the end of the blade. Use the handle of the knife to rock the blade up and down. The subordinate hand should steady the blade as it rocks. Keep scooping the food into a pile, so you can rock chop it until it's as fine as you'd like.








The rock chop works well with a chef's knife because the blade is slightly curved. This makes it easy to rock the blade as it chops.

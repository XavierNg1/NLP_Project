 Wash and dry the strawberries. Hull (remove the stems) and cut them in half.;
,, When the strawberries reach a smooth consistency, rub them through a fine sieve placed over a bowl. This way will ensure the seeds are removed.
 Add icing sugar, if you are using it in your recipe. Stir until dissolved. If you're also using liqueur, add it to the strawberry mixture at this stage. Keep in the fridge until required, if the coulis is too thick, thin it down with a little water.

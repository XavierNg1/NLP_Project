Lightly press this note to obtain concert A.;
, If they are not the same pitch, then the D string will be flat or sharp. Adjust accordingly until they are in tune., The G string harmonic producing a D3 is found in the same place as where you lightly pressed the D string. All you need to do is to play that harmonic a string down., When these harmonics are in tune, then your cello should be in tune and ready to go.

 Disclose your feelings about anger to your loved ones. Talk to them about the strategies you’re using to minimize angry outbursts and use effective assertive communication. You might be able to develop a system with those close to you (particularly your partner) whereby if you feel as though you are losing your temper, you can use a code word or signal that lets them know you need a break from the conversation or situation you’re in.
 Medication alone may not be the best approach to solving an anger problem, but combining medication with other methods to regulate your emotions might help you gain control over your anger. Medications are often prescribed when the anger problem accompanies another disorder, such as bipolar disorder or depression. The specific medicines used to treat anger depend on the source of the anger. If the anger accompanies generalized anxiety, likely medications may include SSRIs and SNRIs. If the anger accompanies depression, an antidepressant such as Prozac may be prescribed.If you have a problem with addiction, be sure to discuss your history with your physician. Some mood-altering drugs are addictive and should be avoided in cases of past substance abuse.
 If you want to avoid anger management courses, working one-on-one with a qualified therapist who specializes in anger issues can be the best route to anger management success. A therapist can give you additional relaxation techniques to use in situations that make you feel angry. She can help you develop emotional coping skills and communication training. Additionally, a psychotherapist who specializes in helping resolve problems from someone’s past (such as neglect or abuse from childhood) can help mitigate anger tied to past events.

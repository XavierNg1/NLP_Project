 First, set your oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius). While that preheats, line your baking sheet with parchment paper. On the paper, trace a circle roughly nine inches (23 cm) in diameter., Crack your eggs and remove the yolks. Add the whites to a large mixing bowl and beat them. Add one tablespoon of sugar and mix it in as you continue to beat your egg whites, then repeat until youâ€™ve added all your sugar. Once the mixture turns thick and glossy, fold in your vanilla extract, lemon juice, and cornstarch., Use a spoon to transfer the meringue to the circle that you traced on your parchment paper. To start, keep the bulk of it toward the center. Once all the meringue has been transferred, use your spoon to spread the meringue from the center out toward the edges. Continue to do so until the edges are higher than the center. Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for one hour., Once the meringue has finished baking, transfer it to a wire rack to cool off. While it does, beat your heavy cream in a small mixing bowl until it turns into stiff little peaks on the surface. Peel and slice your kiwi as evenly as possible. Once the meringue has cooled, transfer it to a serving plate, fill the center with with your whipped cream, arrange your kiwi slices on top, and serve.

 Canaries with diarrhea may have intestinal issues due to a dirty cage. Take the canary out of the cage as well as any accessories like perches and swings. Vacuum the bottom of the cage to remove any stray food. Remove any droppings in the cage. Use hot soapy water to wash the entire cage.Allow the cage to air dry in the sun.
Make sure you also vacuum and wash any accessories in the cage so they are clean.
 Canaries can contract intestinal bugs due to dirty water and food dishes. To make sure the canary’s diarrhea does not get worse, remove the water and food dishes from the cage. Mix dish soap with one part bleach and nine parts water. Clean the water and food dishes well in the solution.Make sure you rinse all of the bleach solution off the dishes well with running water.
Let the water and food dishes air dry before putting them back in the cage.
 Get in the habit of cleaning the canary’s cage once a week or several times a week. Cleaning the cage, as well as the cage accessories and the dishes, will ensure the canary does not contract any intestinal bugs or digestive issues. It can prevent the canary from getting diarrhea again.

You may set up a cleaning schedule for the cage so you clean it regularly.

 Once you've had chance to thoroughly examine the cover, carefully open the book to examine the pages. For very collectible books, the use of tweezers is recommended to minimize contact with harmful skin oils. Your first step is to count the pages.


Make sure there are no missing pages in the comic book. Missing pages severely impact a comic's value., With older comics, it is common for the center-fold pages (and sometimes other page as well) to become detached from the staples.Make note of how many pages (or "wraps") are detached, either fully or partially.
 In addition to damage caused by readers, paper stored improperly can easily degrade. There are several common problems with the pages you should watch out for and make note of:Tears, creases, or cuts (such as clipped coupons)
Tape, glue, or other attempts to repair pages
Writing or other soil to the pages
Water damage, often leading to a stiffness or rippling of the paper
Staple migration, a condition that occurs when the rust from staples stains the paper around it

, Today's comics are printed on a higher-quality paper that withstands aging reasonably well. With older comics, this is not the case--the quality of the paper is likely to have degraded some from age.Look for discoloration or brittleness. Especially in comics from the 1980s and earlier, the paper can become yellow or tan as it oxidizes, and loses some of it's structural integrity.
A certain amount of discoloration is expected and acceptable in very old comics, but the less the better.

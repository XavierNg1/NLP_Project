 Annuities are financial investment options for those who want secure, steady, and guaranteed income during their retirement. An annuity is an illiquid asset, meaning that it cannot easily be sold or exchanged for cash.When you cash out of your annuity, you have the option to take a lump-sum payment, or you can choose to have guaranteed payments that are scheduled for a set period of time.;
, In the U.S., you do not pay taxes on your contributions to your annuity. Once you begin to receive your annuity payments, they are taxed as ordinary income.It is important to research the tax rules for your country, as they may vary elsewhere.


It is important to remember that there are penalties for drawing out all your cash from your annuity prior to age 59 Â½. In the U.S., you may be required to pay an additional 10% penalty tax on your annuity payments if you withdraw early.
In the U.S., annuities also have a state premium tax, which varies from state to state. The amount you originally deposited into the annuity is taxed, and it can range anywhere from .25% to 2.50%. This information is not often disclosed and should be discussed with your insurer or financial investor., There are two types of annuities: a deferred annuity and an immediate annuity.


An immediate annuity will allow you to receive payments as soon as you make your initial investment. Individuals close to retirement often choose an immediate annuity.A deferred annuity will accumulate wealth over time, and you will not receive payments until an elected time period.This payment period can last for the remainder of your life, or it can be distributed for a set period of time.These payments are taxed as ordinary income.In some annuity plans, you can choose a death benefit option, which means that your beneficiaries will receive a payment from the insurance company.

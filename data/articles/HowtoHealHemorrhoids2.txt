 Preventing hemorrhoids from cropping up in the first place is a good way to avoid having to treat them. Try practicing all of the methods below in order to prevent hemorrhoids from afflicting you.


Drink 8 glasses of water per day.Drinking lots of fluid will help.
Eat a diet rich in fiber, especially fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, in order to ease bowel movements.
Don't be afraid to use stool softeners if necessary.
 Hemorrhoids can be caused by excessive straining during bowel movements. Try to let the bowel movement pass without straining or forcing, as this can cause an unnecessary pressure buildup and worsen hemorrhoids.
 If you sit for long periods of time, get up and move around. Constant pressure can cause and/or worsen hemorrhoids.
 If the area with hemorrhoids itches, apply a bit of witch hazel. When wiping, don't use tissue to itch the area.


Use softer, non-aggravating toilet paper. Avoid toilet paper that is colored and/or perfumed.
 Cotton undergarments are very breathable fabrics. They also have the benefit of being softer and less irritating than other non-natural fabrics.

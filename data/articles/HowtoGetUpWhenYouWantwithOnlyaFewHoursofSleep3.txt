 Later in the day, try to lie low and not engage in activities that require a lot of mental processing. If you have work or school, this may be difficult. Try to reschedule meetings or phone calls at work if possible. Limit interaction with others as people running on low sleep tend to not pick up on non-verbal social cues. Go easy on yourself for the day. Keep in mind everyone has off days. If you're not functioning your best for one class period or one work day, you can always do better tomorrow., Your memory is impaired if you're running on little sleep. Multitasking at work and school is a bad idea. Try to stick to one task at a time if you're running on little sleep., If you periodically have mornings when you're running on low sleep, look for long-term solutions. Try to improve your sleep hygiene so you'll fall asleep easier and have a high-quality rest each night.


Go to sleep and wake up at roughly the same time each day. Your body functions on a natural circadian rhythm. If you go to sleep at 11 PM and wake up at 8 AM each night, your body will naturally adjust. You'll feel tired before bedtime and energetic in the morning.Keep your sleeping and waking life separate. Do not keep electronics in your bedroom and do not engage in activities other than sleeping (or sex) in your bed. You want your body to associate your bedroom with sleep time so your mind will be geared for rest when you get in bed.Have a relaxing bedtime ritual. Before bed, engage in a calming activity like meditation, reading, or taking a warm bath. Having nightly rituals you engage in before bed helps signal your body that it's time for sleep.

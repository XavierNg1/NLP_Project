 The simplest way to use water to de-clump mascara is removing the wand and dipping it in hot water. Leave the wand in the hot water for a few minutes. Then, remove the wand and place it back into your mascara. Do not pump the wand. Simply place it back in the container. If successful, your mascara should be less clumpy the next time you apply it.You can use your mascara right away after using this method.;
, If simply dipping the wand in hot water is not successful, you can try a more intense method. Boil a pot of water big enough that you can completely submerge your sealed tube of mascara in the water. Let the water come to a rolling boil before reducing the heat to a simmer.Place the mascara into the simmering water. Allow it to sit for a few minutes.
Take out the mascara using tongs. After the mascara has cooled to the touch, check the mascara to see if it's more liquid-like and does not clump as much.
 If your mascara is still a little clumpy after being submerged in the water, add a few drops of olive oil in the mascara tube. This should loosen up the mascara further and restore it to its original consistency.

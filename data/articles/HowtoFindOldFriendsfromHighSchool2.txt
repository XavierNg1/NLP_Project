 Memories can fade over time, so make sure you double check your friendâ€™s name and any other relevant information before you begin your search. Bring out all of those old high school yearbooks if you can't remember the full names of your friends. When trying to find your high school friends, it's considerably easier if you know both their first and last names.Also, by looking through your yearbooks you might remember another friend that you'd like to get together with sometime.
 Consult other people who might have known the person and ask if they have any information that might be helpful for you in your search. Ask people you know from high school that you still keep in touch with if they know how to reach your other friend.Perhaps they will know if your friend got married and changed their name, or if your friend moved to another city or works at a certain place. These are all important pieces of information that could help you find your friend.
Try asking your parents or other family members if they remember anything else that might help you find your friend from high school.
 If your old friend ever gave you their home phone number, their cell phone number, their email address, their home address, etc., consider calling them, emailing them, or going over to their house to see if they'll respond.Although most times your friend will have moved out of the house that they lived in during high school, talk to their parents or the current owners of the home and try to find out where your friend lives now and if they'll give you any updated contact information.
 If you are desperate to find a friend from high school and none of the other methods have worked, you could consider hiring a private investigator. A trained professional may have better luck tracking someone down for you.This will cost money, so keep that in mind before deciding to go this route.

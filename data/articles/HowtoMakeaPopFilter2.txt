, A sewing or embroidery hoop is a simple hoop made from metal and/or plastic that holds a piece of fabric in place when you're sewing. Any size hoop will work, but a hoop of about six inches across will be the same size as most pop filters.


Embroidery hoops usually have a fairly simple latch on one side. Undo this latch and slip the fabric over the inner hoop so that it stretches beyond its edges on all sides. Seat the inner hoop back inside the outer hoop and close the latch, keeping the fabric tight. See our embroidery hoop article for more help.
 It may seem counter-intuitive, but stiffer fabrics tend to make better pop filters. If you have the tight metal or plastic netting that's usually stretched across the open spaces of screen doors, this works especially well.Simply stretch it across the embroidery hoop as you would with the embroidery fabric.


Screen door mesh can be found at most large hardware stores. It's cheap, but you may be forced to buy a roll of the material, rather than the small amount that you actually need., Now, all you need to do is move your new pop filter into position. As in the section above, one easy way to do this is to tape, glue, or clamp the outside the hoop to a free mic stand. You can also attach the hoop to a stick or a straightened-out coat hanger and then attach this behind the microphone.


Sing or talk through the filter and into the mic as normal. With this method, the filter is only one layer thick, but this is OK. It should work just as well.

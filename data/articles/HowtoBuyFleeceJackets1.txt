 Lightweight fleeces have low bulk and allow for moderate airflow, which means that your skin can still breathe. This makes it the perfect choice for runners and other cold-weather athletes who exert high amounts of energy.;
, Hikers and individuals performing other mild aerobic activity may want to upgrade to a mid-weight fleece, especially as the temperatures really start to drop. While mid-weight jackets are not as breathable as lightweight ones, they often work well for people generating mild to moderate levels of body heat.
 These jackets are often worn as a mid-layer between base and shell layers during extremely cold weather--e.g., between a t-shirt and an outer coat.
 If you plan on wearing your jacket toward the end of autumn or the beginning of spring, when the temperatures are cold but not freezing, try wearing a mid-weight fleece for your outerwear. This thickness often provides enough airflow to prevent you from overheating, but still keeps the harshest of winds from chilling you.
 These jackets work especially well for activities like easy skiing and camping. Heavyweight fleece provides a thick layer of insulated warmth that can easily protect you against the cold as long as no precipitation is present.

 If the problem is asking you to determine how much of something is left, or to decrease an amount, or to find a discount, you will first multiply to find the fractional amount, then subtract the fractional amount from the original whole number. If the problem is asking you to determine how much of something there is after an increase, you will first multiply to find the fractional amount, then add the fractional amount to the original whole number.For example, a problem might ask, “If you have $294{\displaystyle \$294}, and you give 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}} of it away, how much money do you have left?” In this case, you will multiply, then subtract.
 To do this, turn the whole number into a fraction by placing it over a denominator of 1{\displaystyle 1}.

For example, to find 294×56{\displaystyle 294\times {\frac {5}{6}}}, you would change the problem to 2941×56{\displaystyle {\frac {294}{1}}\times {\frac {5}{6}}}.
 This will give you your new numerator.

For example, 294×5=1,470{\displaystyle 294\times 5=1,470}.
 This will give you your new denominator. Rewrite the new fraction.

For example, 1×6=6{\displaystyle 1\times 6=6}. So the new fraction is 1,4706{\displaystyle {\frac {1,470}{6}}}.
 First divide the numerator by the denominator to see if the result is a whole number. If the result is not a whole number, you should reduce the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor. For complete instructions on how to reduce a fraction, read Reduce Fractions.

For example, 1,470÷6=245{\displaystyle 1,470\div 6=245}, so 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}} of 294=245{\displaystyle 294=245}. This is the fractional amount you are decreasing by.
 This will give you your final answer.

For example, 294−245=49{\displaystyle 294-245=49}. So, if you have $294{\displaystyle \$294}, and you give 56{\displaystyle {\frac {5}{6}}} of it away, you have $49{\displaystyle \$49} left.

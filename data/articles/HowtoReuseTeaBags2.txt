 Active compounds found in tea are a natural alternative to harsh chemicals commonly found in store-bought dish soaps. Help degrease especially problematic dirty dishes by adding old teabags to a sink full of warm water and soaking them for a while before trying your hand at scrubbing them again., Set two or three used teabags in your toilet and let them sit for several minutes. Flush the toilet, then scrub the bottom of the bowl to help remove pesky stains at the bottom. Be careful, thoughâ€”leaving the tea in the toilet for too long can actually cause more staining due to the tannins, so it might be better to use a lighter-colored tea for this purpose., Wipe your mirrors down with wet used teabags and then buff them dry with a soft cloth. The natural, active compounds in the tea help to break down scum, and making sure to dry the mirror in circular motions will help you achieve a streak-free shine., Split open your used teabags and wait for the tea leaves to become mostly dry. Then, sprinkle them all over your carpet or rug and wait until they are completely dry. Vacuum up the tea leaves, and not only will you have a cleaner carpet but your vacuum cleaner will smell better, too!

 There are other sources of funding available in addition to collecting donations from individuals. Grants are a popular way of funding overseas volunteer opportunities. Some of these are funded by the government, while others are privately funded.Once you've chosen a volunteer program, ask if they know of any grant opportunities. They will likely know of some funding sources.
Read the guidelines carefully. Each grant will look for specific qualifications. Carefully fill out each application exactly as specified.
 Scholarships are also available for overseas volunteers. Many volunteer organizations will help you find scholarships. You can also do a search online, using specific terms such as "volunteer" "health care" "Uganda", for example.Some programs will give the scholarship funds directly to the volunteer program. The funds are then used to pay for housing, travel, etc.
Scholarships vary in amount. Apply for as many as possible, so that you can increase your chances of funding your entire trip.
Be prepared to write an essay for a scholarship application. You should discuss your goals and your passion for the cause, and why you want to work in that specific country.
 Websites are a very popular way to raise funds. You can set up a personal site that explains why you are collecting donations. Donors can simply click a button to donate to you. Popular sites include Gofundme, IndieGogo, and Kickstarter.Include personal information, such as the story of what inspired you to volunteer.
Ask your friends to link to your website on their social media accounts.

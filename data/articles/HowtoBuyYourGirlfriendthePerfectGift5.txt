 Instead of giving her something she'll set on her shelf, try giving her something you can go out and do. Whether it's something you both love or something you don't like as much but she does, it will make an unforgettable gift.For instance, try getting tickets to a musical or play. Alternatively, you could buy tickets for a local symphony., For instance, try getting her into a painting class if she's always loved painting. Alternatively, you both could try a beer-brewing class together if she loves beer, which could turn into a life-long passion. Just make sure it's something she's passionate about, which you should know from paying attention to what she says and does.
 Even a short jaunt to a cabin nearby can be romantic under the right conditions. It doesn't have to be super expensive, as long as you think about what you your girlfriend likes. For instance, if she isn't super outdoorsy, take her for small getaway in a nearby city or quaint small town.For an even smaller getaway, try staying one night at a fancy hotel in town.Another option is a "staycation." Basically, you both take a day off from work and make fun plans in the city you live in. For instance, you could make her a picnic and go to a park or go to a concert at the botanical gardens.

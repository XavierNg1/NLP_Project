 If someone is having serious problems, whether they show it or not they're probably already judging themselves really harshly. Everything you could say to them they've probably already thought about. This means that one of the most productive ways to help them is to just listen to them. Be their sounding board. They may just talk themselves into whatever you were trying to get them to do!

, Show them that you care. Don't judge or shame them. Sympathize and let them know that you understand that the mistakes they made were only human. They need to see that you are on their side, even if that side turns out to be doing the opposite of what they want to do.
 People who make continuously bad decisions tend to think very little of themselves. Generally, if you've made some really poor decisions, you know it, right? Sometimes their poor opinion of themselves even causes them to do bad things to begin with. Build their sense of self-worth by showing them all the incredible things they can do and you'll find that they may start fixing their own problems.
 Some people think that they can't overcome obstacles because they have too many faults. Help them to understand that everyone has faults and that we all have to work around them or overcome them. Show them that perfection isn't necessary but that effort counts for everything.

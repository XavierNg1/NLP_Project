, In this case, 6*4 is greater than 10 (24).
 Just as above, cross-multiply the ones with the opposing tens and add them together. In this case, (2*4) + (6*1) = 14. Write 14 underneath 24 one space to the left (ending on the tens column) If you're struggling with keeping the numbers in the right spot, you can put 1 zero before your cross multiplication product.
 Multiply the tens. 2*1 = 2. Place this product another space to the left, in the hundreds column as shown. Again, you can also put two zeros before it to help you keep the numbers at the correct place value.
 Add the three rows as you would in a normal multiplication method. The sum of the three rows you created equal 364, our answer.

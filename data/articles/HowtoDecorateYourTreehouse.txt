 Will you paint them or leave them wooden? Wood gives a real natural feel, while paint will make you feel like you are in an actual house. Different kinds of paint have different feels. Black will feel like this is your little dark hut and bright colors will feel like you are in a house full of sunshine.;
, Do you want to leave it wooden, or use carpet? Fluffy or flat? Carpet gives the room a cosy feel and a wooden floor is like a little den. Tiles aren't very popular, though. They would be used for a kitchen or a bathroom.
 Windows can be wide, narrow, tall, or short. They can also be square, heart, circle or star shaped. It's your choice. If you want sunlight to shine into your room and make it warm, you have to have windows. Or, if you like, no windows at all. Add curtains, too.
 If you want a spiritual feel, add an idol or two, like a fairy or animal. It would also be cool to have a wind chime.
 You can use couches, little tables, beanbags, paintings, a computer and a desk, lights, or anything else. You can choose a cosy feel, dark feel, sunny feel, etc. The list goes on.
 This can be a television, Nintendo, radio, or even calculators; anything that you can use to entertain yourself when you are bored. For Nintendo try to use it as a laptop and camera if you have the DSi. You can hook up internet to that, which would allow Youtube in replacement for Radio. Try keeping a bookcase in there to hold everything on.
 Rain will soak through wood and we don't want it to wet your furniture or electronics! Try to cover it with moss, tree bark, waterproof blankets, or anything else to keep it out!

 The name is a little misleading, as dry cleaning products aren’t actually “dry.” They’re liquids — but they don’t have any water, like water-based solvents do.You may be able to find dry cleaning solvents in the cleaning aisle of the grocery store.
If not, you can purchase it easily online.
 Dry cleaning solutions have a very strong odor, so open any doors and windows in the area to let the smell escape and let clean air in. Turn on a ceiling fan or set up a floor fan pointing toward the window or do to encourage the fumes to leave the room.
 Rather than applying the solution directly to the couch, you want to apply it to a rag that you’ll blot against the stained portions of the fabric.These solutions tend to be very strong, so remember that a little goes a long way. Follow the guidelines on the packaging for the specific product you purchased.
 Rub the rag on a small, little-seen area of the couch. Wait 10 minutes and check to see if there has been any discoloration on the sofa fabric. Press a paper towel against the wet area to see if any dye comes off. If not, move on to the next step.
 You don’t want to rub the stains — just to press the rag with dry cleaner on it against them. This might take a long time, but don’t get impatient and apply too much dry cleaner to the stain. This might harm the fabric.


Take breaks and allow the solvent to dry from time to time for heavy stains that require a great deal of treatment.
Reapply dry cleaner to the rag as necessary, but remember to show restraint.
 If you let the chemicals sit on your stain for too long, they can leave discoloration on your fabric. To remove the dry cleaner from the fabric, moisten a new clean cloth with water. It should be damp, but not soaking wet. Blot it over the stains, re-washing and wringing it out as necessary.


Once you’ve finished, let the couch air dry.

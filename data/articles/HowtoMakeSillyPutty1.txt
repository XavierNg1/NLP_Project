 Purchase a 5-ounce (147-milliliter) bottle of clear school glue. Unscrew the cap and pour the glue into a mixing bowl.For interesting silly putter, use the type of school glue that already has glitter in it.
For opaque silly putty, use white school glue instead.;
, This will give your silly putty extra color. Stir in a few drops, then add more if you want a deeper or darker color. If your glue already has color and glitter in it, skip this step.Don't use acrylic, tempera, or poster paint. It's too thick.
 How much glitter you add is entirely up to you. For best results, use the extra-fine scrapbooking glitter, and not the chunky craft kind. If your glue already has glitter in it, skip this step.For metallic putty, try mica powder instead.
 Keep stirring until the color is even and the glitter is spread throughout the glue. You can do this step with a spoon, fork, or even a popsicle stick., Pour in 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of liquid starch, then give the mixture a stir. Keep adding starch and stirring until the glue and starch comes together and forms a putty.Plan on using ½ to ¾ cup (120 to 180 milliliters) total.
Avoid using too much starch, or the silly putty will turn gooey, like slime or "Gak."

, At one point, the putty will clump together and become difficult to stir. Once that happens, take the lump of putty out of the bowl and knead it until it turns firm. There may be some liquid left in the bowl, which is fine., Silly putty is similar to slime or Gak, except that it is more firm. You can stretch it and bounce it. When you are done playing with it, put it into a plastic, zippered bag. You can also use a plastic box with a tight-fitting lid.

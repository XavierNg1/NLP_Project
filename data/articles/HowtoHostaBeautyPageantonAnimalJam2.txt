 Decorate your den with fancy lights and furniture, prepare a room for the princesses, as they will be staying overnight for the different rounds (if you're having a around the world tour use different dens). Also, put in a runway and don't forget the wallpaper and floor, as this will help to impress the pageant princesses.
 Buy tiaras or a prize for the winner. If you can't buy a tiara, buy something else that is glamorous most preferred- clothing. Prepare some questions for the contestants.
 Go to Jamaa and announce your Beauty Pageant. Make it sound exciting, so that you get more people.
 Get everyone to sit around the room and call out the first person. Ask them questions such as: What do you want in the world? What do you like about being in pageants? Whats' your favorite outfit?

, However, use different questions.
 Get everyone to line up with their talent, whether it's singing or dancing, or something else. Let everyone perform this one at a time.
 This can include: Evening Gown or Swimsuit.
 Have Queen as a title, and a Lady Royal title. The Queen title is the highest one, so choose wisely, depending on which contestants have made the best efforts.
 Thank everyone for coming.

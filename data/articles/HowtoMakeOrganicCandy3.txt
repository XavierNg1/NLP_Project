 The measuring cup must be heat-resistant., Add a few inches (7 to 9 cm) of water to a small saucepan. Place the measuring cup inside, and heat the two together over medium heat until the coconut oil is warm and mostly melted., Pour the coconut oil into the food processor as well as the cocoa powder, coconut/palm sugar, salt, and vanilla. Process the ingredients together using a slow to medium speed until well combined., Plastic wrap will also work. Make sure that the bottom and sides of the pan are covered., You may need to scrape it out using a rubber spatula. Use the spatula to smooth the fudge out evenly., Fold the sides of the paper over the top of the fudge. Press down, gently, to even out the thickness., Do not remove it from the parchment paper yet, however. Keep it wrapped in the parchment paper as it cools., Keep it in the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes until it sets., Unwrap the fudge and use a sharp knife to cut small squares. You can get about one dozen moderately-sized squares from this, or you can get up to two dozen squares if you cut the fudge smaller.

 It's the grey gear icon likely found in the App Drawer.
 This option is in the "Device" section.


On some Androids (such as the Samsung Galaxy), you must first tap Device before you can tap Apps.
 Doing so will open the "SD Card" page, which displays your currently used hard drive space in the bottom-left corner of the screen and your total storage space in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
 Doing so will open the "Running" tab which displays your currently-running programs.
 There are three values at the top of the page that will show you your Android's RAM usage:



System - The number of gigabytes currently used by your Android's operating system.

Apps - The number of gigabytes currently used by running apps.

Free - The number of free gigabytes of RAM.

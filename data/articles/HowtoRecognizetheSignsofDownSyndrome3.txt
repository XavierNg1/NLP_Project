 Many people with Down Syndrome are described as having flat, rounded, wide noses with small nasal bridges. The nasal bridge is the flat section of the nose between the eyes. This area can be described as being "pushed in.", Those with Down Syndrome usually exhibit round eyes that slant upwards. While the outer corners of most eyes usually turn downward, those with Down Syndrome have eyes that turn upward (almond shaped).In addition, doctors may recognize what are known as Brushfield spots, or harmless brown or white flecks in the iris of the eyes.There may also be skin folds present between the eyes and nose.These can resemble eye bags.
 People with Down Syndrome tend to have smaller ears that are set lower on the head. Some may have ears whose tops fold over slightly., Due to low muscle tone, the mouth may appear to be turned downward and the tongue may protrude from the mouth.Teeth may come in later and in a different order than usual. Teeth may also be small, unusually shaped, or out of place.An orthodontist can help straighten crooked teeth once a child is old enough. Children with Down Syndrome may wear braces for a long time.

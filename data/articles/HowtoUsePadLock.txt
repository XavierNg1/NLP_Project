 It can be found at http://kitchenbudapest.hu/en/projects/padlock. Your Mac will need to have OS X 10.6 and it must have built-in or external loudspeakers.;
,,, Removal of these devices from either end of the USB cable will activate the alarm.
 If you wish to unplug the devices without setting off the alarm, or you need to turn off the alarm, go to the software window. Press "unlock" and the alarm will cease.


Re-plugging in the removed i-device will also inactivate the alarm.
 Although this alarm is handy, it doesn't stop theft, it merely alerts you to the possibility. When in public places, be sure to:


Keep an eye on your i-devices at all times. This includes those times you think it'll be all right to leave your gear unattended, such as getting up to pay for a coffee or getting a book from the library shelf!
Use a Kensington or similar physical lock for your laptop if at a public library, cafe, etc. (unfortunately, the iPad currently doesn't have a locking port).
Always know the whereabouts on you of your iPhone and iPod; keep well secreted in a bag or enclosed pocket.
Relying on this software when traveling is foolhardy. While you might live in a high trust suburb, city, or country, when traveling, you simply won't know until you've lost something whether you can be as relaxed with your i-devices as you are on home territory. Always assume the worst and guard well!

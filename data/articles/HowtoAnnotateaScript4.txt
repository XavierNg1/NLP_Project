 When you annotate a script, it is a good idea to use a pencil rather than a pen. This is because you may develop new ideas as you familiarize yourself with the character and story. Using a pencil makes it easy to erase a note if you change your mind about it and write in a new one., After you have finished annotating your text, make sure that you review your annotations. Take time to read through all of them and make changes or additions to your annotations if you have developed new ideas about something.


You can use what you have written to help guide your actions, tone, and gestures during rehearsals. For example, your notes on your characterâ€™s intention can help you to decide how to stand, how your face should look, and what tone to use when delivering your lines.
 Your director and fellow actors can help you if you have unanswered questions or if you are struggling with something within the script. Bring up any unanswered questions that you have during rehearsals and listen to what your director and fellow actors have to say.


By collaborating with others, you may gain an even deeper understanding of your character and use this knowledge to improve your performance.

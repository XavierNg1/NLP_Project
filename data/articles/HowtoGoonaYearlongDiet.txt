 Prepare meals together, work out together, and give each other moral support.;
, It's easier to diet when your well-meaning friend isn't offering you batches of her homemade butter cookies!

, If possible, seek a healthy and satisfying alternative. For example, if you love cheeseburgers, grill up some garden burgers with low-fat cheese and fresh spinach instead of Iceberg lettuce and ground beef. If there's no substitute, work out ways to treat yourself. For instance, if you adore chocolate cake, make chocolate cupcakes for your office, and give a single cupcake to everyone.
 This will help you see patterns in your eating habits, and help curb mindless snacking.
 Take small bites.
 For example, if you usually have a morning donut fix at the office, bring yourself some toast topped with low-fat ricotta cheese and cinnamon, or some apple slices drizzled with vanilla yogurt.
 Prep ahead of time on the weekends. If possible, pack up whole meals so you have ready-to-eat home-cooked food on hand.
 Check out seasonings and dishes from exotic cuisines. This also gives you a way to eat healthily when you go out.
 Offer to host holiday potlucks at your house, and encourage your guests to bring healthy treats. For instance, instead of chips and dip, get whole nuts that your guests can crack and toast themselves, or offer a veggie tray.
 For example, try a family snowball fight, or host active party games.

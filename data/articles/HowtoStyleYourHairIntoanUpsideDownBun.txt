 To do this, simply tie a low ponytail. Then, directly above the elastic, create two sections of hair. Pull the ponytail through the gap that has been created.









As you're doing this, keep a hair tie on the wrist of your dominant hand.
,, Winding the twist around the base of the ponytail, pull to the left, then finally upwards. Continue until the bun is drawn together tightly.
 With your other hand, bring down the hair tie you placed on your wrist at the beginning and firmly wrap around base of the bun. You may find it easiest to use two hair ties to secure the bun for physical activities, like running. However, for most non-strenuous activities, the bun should hold with a single tie.

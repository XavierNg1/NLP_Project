 This is a fun and advanced kiss that you should try with someone you are comfortable kissing. During this kiss, one person should suck on a cinnamon candy and the other person should suck on a mint. Begin to French kiss. Slowly switch the mints and the candy in your mouths.

Switch the mint and the candy back and forth until you need to come up for air or until they have dissolved.



 


You can do the trade-off kiss with any small candies or mints, but be careful not to choke on them.






If you're nervous, start the kiss by practicing trading just one item between your mouths to get the hang of it.

, First, put a piece of long-lasting gum in your mouth just before you and your partner French kiss. While you're kissing, pass the gum back and forth, and see how long it takes for the flavor to run out!


Choose a gum with a sexy flavor, like strawberry or winter mint.
 Take a sip of your favorite drink, which could be either something alcoholic or sweet. Begin to kiss your partner, and when your lips meet, pour the drink into your partner's mouth. Take a very small sip of the drink to avoid spilling it.


Your first attempt should be with a clear substance so you don't end up spilling it everywhere.
 Take a few sips of an ice-cold drink or chew on an ice cube until your mouth is freezing. Then, kiss your partner and graze your tongues. You will feel a sexy chill if you do it right.
 Pour a little bit of Pop Rocks into your partner's mouth and then begin to French kiss him.


Both of you will feel a playful tingle in your mouths.

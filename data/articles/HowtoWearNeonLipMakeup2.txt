 If you love pink neon lips, they can easily look sloppy without lip liner. After adding pink to your lips, choose a complimentary liner. Keep the pink lips contained by drawing a thin line of lipliner over your lips.
 Lilac shades do come in neon, but tend to be lighter than other shades. While most neon lipstick is applied in a light layer, with lilacs you should lay the color on somewhat thick. Add a couple of layers until the lipstick is bright and noticeable.








If you wear eyeliner, lilac shades pair well with brown eyeliner.
 If you want neon lips for multiple occasions, go for a red orange shade. Red orange tends to match with a variety of skin tones and works in a variety of settings. If you, for example, are going into the office and then out with friends afterwards, red orange is a great color to choose.








Another perk of red orange lipstick is that it does not require lip liner. This saves you some time when getting ready.
 Peach liner looks somewhat unnatural, which is okay if you're going for a fun, bold look. To make your peach liner more defined, black lip liner works well. It accentuates the peach color and makes your lips look neat and contained.








Peach neons are best if you're going somewhere like a club or a bar. They don't work as well for an every day look.
 Neon reds can be incredibly bold. Even if you want a very noticeable look, it's a good idea to tone reds down slightly. Add a light layer of powder over your red lipstick. Your lips will still look noticeable, but they won't be overwhelming.

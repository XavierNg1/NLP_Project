 This should be sufficient to clean up stains from washable markers. Rub gently in a circular motion. Consider placing a towel on the ground to prevent water from dripping on the ground., If a baby wipe does not pick up the stain, spray it with hairspray. Then rub the stain with a paper towel or soft cloth. Wipe gently in a circular motion. Look to see if any of the stain was removed. If so, repeat until the surface is clean.

You may need to repeat this step several times to remove the stain.
 If none of the previous steps have worked, try using toothpaste. Cover the stain in toothpaste and let it sit for ten minutes. After ten minutes, wipe the surface clean with a soft cloth.

 iTunes can do this. You can select all of your music files, right click, and click "Create AAC Version." However, this option converts your music files and moves them to a different folder which you will have to hunt down. I would suggest downloading a different software, such as RealPlayer Converter, which is free, to convert the files to .m4a files. Make sure you convert the files to a separate location from your old music files and make sure you can access the new folder.;
,, In the File menu, click "Add Directory" and choose the folder in which you put the converted music files.
 Select them all (Ctrl + a) and right click. On the list of options, you should see an option named "Extended Tags." Click on that option.
 Type in "ITUNESADVISORY" in the "Field" box in the new window that pops up and "0" in the "Value" box. Click "OK" on both windows.
 Click "Customize Columns" and click "New." Type in "iTunes Advisory" for "Name" and "" for "Value." Click "OK."

, The column may be all the way to the right, so make sure to check there.
 If a song is explicit, type in a "1" in the "iTunes Advisory" column. If a song is clean, type a "2" instead. If the song had no profanity to begin with, leave the column a "0" (or you could leave it blank).
, Your old music files are still there. Select them all and press delete. Drag the new files in. Your explicit songs should now have the "Explicit" tag and your clean songs should now have a "Clean" tag.

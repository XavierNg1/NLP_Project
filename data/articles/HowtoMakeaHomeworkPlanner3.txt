 When you pick a binder, remember to consider size. You could save space with a .5-inch binder, but you may find that you require more planning space, so using a 1- or 2-inch binder may be ideal. You can recycle an old binder or purchase a new one.


To avoid adding bulk to your backpack, print out calendars and weekly planning templates and put them in your regular binder. That way you can easily track your assignments without worrying about juggling an extra notebook.
 Most planners include sections for monthly calendars, weekly planning sheets, and to-do lists. Since youâ€™re using a binder, it will be easy to add new sections later if you decide you need additional planning materials.
 Using either a template or your own design, print out the sheets you will need for each section. This will include blank calendars, blank weekly planning sheets, and your favorite to-do list organizer. You may choose to use regular notebook paper for your to-do lists.
 As you put in your planning sheets, you will want to separate them with standard index dividers for binders so that you can easily flip between sections. Using index dividers will also allow you to label each section for easy organization.


Open the rings on your binder and first insert your to-do list paper. Place an index divider on top of the stack.
Add your monthly planning sheets, followed by the index divider for that section.
Finally, add your calendars, and, if you like, an index divider for that section.

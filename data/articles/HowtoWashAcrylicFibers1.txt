 You can’t rely on detergent alone to get out a big stain on your acrylic clothes. Hit the spot with a spray stain remover and rub the remover in with your fingers so you know it’s really worked in the fabric.Don’t forget to spray the stain remover on the inside of the clothing too.
If it’s a really old or stubborn stain, try scrubbing the remover in lightly with an old -- but clean -- toothbrush.;
, Washable acrylic fibers aren’t very fragile so you don’t need to use a special laundry detergent for them. A basic all-purpose formula will do the trick just fine.All-purpose detergent works for pretty much all washable acrylic fibers but you should always check the care label for any special instructions.
 Acrylic clothes can get hard and crunchy if you wash them in cold water. Whenever you’re washing a load with acrylic fibers, hit the button for the warm water setting to keep your stuff soft and fresh.Whatever you do, don’t use hot water on acrylic fibers. You’ll wind up shrinking them.
 Even with warm water, your acrylic clothes can get hard and stiff if you wash them a lot. Keep them nice and soft by adding some fabric softener to the wash just before it goes into the last rinse cycle.Don’t pour the fabric softener right on the clothing or you can wind up with stains. Add it to the water in the washer instead.

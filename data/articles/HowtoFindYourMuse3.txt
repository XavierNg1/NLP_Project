 A great way to find a muse or inspiration is by socializing with a variety of people. Surround yourself with several personality types in your daily life and observe how each of them respond to both normal and unique situations. These observations can help to inspire creative stories. For example, think of a time when your friend did something that was hilarious or interesting. Can you find inspiration in these stories? There are unwritten tales all around you.


You may find inspiration in stories about people overcoming adversity.
You could also find inspiration in stories of hardship and loss.
 Often people will find a muse in other creative people who inspire them by creating art. For example, if you are a musician you may get inspired by other musicians who are creating new and unique sounds and music. Try seeking out and surrounding yourself with other creative people. Ask them where they get their artistic inspiration from and how they create art on a daily basis.Collaborating with other artists, writers, or musicians can also help to inspire you. Sometimes your muse is a person with similar interests to yourself.
Family and friends can also provide you with inspiration when they achieve success.
 Sometimes you will find a muse in a complete stranger. Make sure that you are present when you are out in public. For example, avoid spending too much time on your phone. Instead, look around and watch other people as they go about their daily lives. What motivates them? How do their lives differ from yours?

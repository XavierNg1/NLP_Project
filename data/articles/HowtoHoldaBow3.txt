 Rest your hand on top in an open "handshake" position, with your palm resting lightly on top of the frog.


The "frog" refers to the enclosed mechanism that holds and tightens the bow hair.
A "handshake" position simply refers to the sort of position you would hold your hand in if you were preparing to shake hands with someone.
Note that this method is one of the most common ways to hold a German bow, but it is not the only way. If you want to explore different techniques, talk it over with a bass teacher or with a more experienced bassist.
 Gradually turn the bow sideways, drawing the frog further into the palm of your hand and pointing the bow inward toward your body.


The tip of your bent thumb should just barely touch the tip of your index finger, and both should rest lightly on top of the bow.
Do not pinch the bow in between your thumb and index finger. They should only rest on top of the bow and should not grab onto it directly.
 Position your middle finger so that it rests directly next to the index finger. The ring finger should rest next to the middle finger, and the pinky should rest beneath the frog.


Your pinky should touch the outer part of the ferrule, the silver part of your bow.
Essentially, the bow will be cupped gently inside of your hand and held in a horizontal position as you play.
 Keep your hands relaxed and flexible to allow for movement, but not a loss of control, as you play. The wrist should bend slightly as you play downward in order to keep the bow straight across the strings.

Similarly, the fingers will straighten a bit as you play, but be sure they do not hyperextend, which will reduce your control and make your transitions difficult on the backstroke.

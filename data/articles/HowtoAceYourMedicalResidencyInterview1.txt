 Though you probably won't know who's going to interview you, log in your program's website for clues before the interview. Find out who the program director is, who the major faculty involved in the program are, and who the current residents are. Chances are, those are the faces you'll see.


Be sure to note what their research interests are. What's their take on their specialty? What have they accomplished? All of this information is fodder for your upcoming interviews. You can talk about that cardiac or heath care policy research paper that they wrote. Even just 10 minutes of background research goes a long way in forming a vague idea about who's in the program and what it's all about.;
, Remember that this is a big decision, so you should have questions. Avoid questions that could be easily found on the program's home page. Instead, use this opportunity to ask about the inner workings of the system. How many months in the ICU? When is the in-service exam? How important are the in-service scores? How are residents evaluated? Use this opportunity to find out if the program is a good fit for you. This is also the time to ask about logistics like parking, ARMs, where you'd eat, where you'd sleep, what are the support services and so on.

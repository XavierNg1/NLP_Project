 This will give you lots of hiding places for your candy. It's even better if the jacket has pockets on the inside, as your parents won't be able to spot the bulges from the candy so easily.
 Wear the jacket to a store or your kitchen and once you have the candy, quickly slip it into your hidden pocket and close the zip.


If you got a receipt from the store, make sure to throw it away so your parents don't find it!

, Once the candy is safely hidden and you arrive home, tell your parents that you really need to go to the bathroom -- no time to take your jacket off!


Then, run to your room and quickly remove the candy from the hidden pocket. Put it somewhere safe, like in your pillowcase or in your underwear drawer.
Don't forget to actually go to the bathroom -- if you don't your parents will know you were lying and up to no good! For best results, flush the toilet as if you did go and turn the sink tap on for a bit as if you're washing your hands.
 Wait until a good moment before you go back to eat the candy -- like when your parents are asleep or entertaining visitors, then they won't be checking in on you!


Just be sure to clean your face before you see them again, you don't want any tell-tale signs of chocolate or stickiness on your face!

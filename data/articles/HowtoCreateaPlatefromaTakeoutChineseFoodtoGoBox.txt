 You will be unfolding the box while the food is inside, so consider how packed the box is and what is inside. Messy sauces or over-packed food containers may end up being a bigger mess when the box is converted into a plate. So size up your meal first.;
, Open top of the box and hold open container in one hand. Gently pull one side of the handle from the box until it is dislodged. This may take a little twisting and turning but it will free itself with a little coaxing.
 (Or just leave the other side of the handle in place. You need to be able to collapse the box and the handle helps to hold it in place.)

, You should see either a staple or flaps holding the box together.
, Open the second side in the same way you opened the other folded side of the box. You now have a flat surface or makeshift plate.

 If your blinds have just a thin layer of dust, a feather duster will be sufficient to clean them. Open the blinds and run a feather duster between each blind, to pick up the dust on both sides.;
, If you're looking for a method that will let you clean in hard-to-reach corners, find an old sock or glove and put it on your hand. Spray Windex on a section of the blinds and run your covered hand along it to pick up the dust. Repeat on every blind.


Windex is safe to use on most blinds, but if you'd prefer a natural substance, use a solution of half water, half vinegar.






For an even quicker cleanup, open your blinds and use your glove or sock-covered thumb and forefinger to pinch one blind at its edge. Run your fingers the length of the blind to pick up the dust from both sides at the same time. Repeat for every blind.
 In many cases, vacuuming the blinds with be sufficient to clean them. It's also a good way to prepare extra dusty blinds for the next stage of cleaning. Start with closed blinds.


Attach your vacuum's hose attachment to its base.






Turn on the vacuum and run the hose attachment over each individual blind from side to side or up and down, depending on what type of blinds you have.






Repeat the process with the blinds turned in the opposite direction to clean the other side.

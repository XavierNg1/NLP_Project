 In order to tape your breasts in this fashion, you are going to be creating a shape similar to a bra. You’ll need four pieces of tape for the base and two pieces as straps to help give you some lift. This is a great option for extra support and for an open back top. Also, it sits lower than the previous method if you have a lower top., Take your tape and stick it on the bottom corner of your left breast. It should be anchored at the top of your ribs. Anchor it well, by sticking it down with both hands. Hold this part of the tape firmly with your left hand.
 Once the tape is secured, use you left hand to pull your right breast toward the left one. Once you find a good amount of cleavage, finish laying your first piece of tape across your right breast.
 Grab your second piece of tape and anchor it on the bottom of your right breast. Holding your breasts together with the desired cleavage, pull this piece of tape across and tape it beneath your original piece of tape. Make sure to pull tightly to keep your desired amount of cleavage.
 Now you’re going to create straps. These straps, however, will reach just below your collarbone, rather than over your shoulder. Take a piece of tape and anchor it below your left breast. Pulling upwards, lay your tape from here to your collarbone. Do the same on the right side. This adds lift and makes your breasts look bigger., Use you final pieces of tape to secure everything. Make sure you tape over your straps, and close any gaps in the tape. Pull them tightly to give added support.

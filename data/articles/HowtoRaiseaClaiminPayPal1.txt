 Before triggering the PayPal resolution process, try to come with an agreement with the seller first. Most times, the seller will gladly work with you to resolve the problem. If you and the seller don’t agree, then proceed with raising it to PayPal.;
, This is the item you’ve purchased online using PayPal against which you want to raise a dispute, either because the item didn’t arrive or the item wasn’t as described.


You can only raise a dispute on PayPal until 45 days after the purchase date.
Make sure you’re covered under the PayPal Buyer Protection.
 Head to PayPal’s website: https://www.paypal.com/ and log in using your e-mail address and password.
 Click "View All of My Transactions" under "My Account."

, Click on "Details" to see the transaction details. Verify that this is the correct transaction you want to dispute.
 Copy the unique transaction ID number. This is needed when raising the dispute with PayPal.
 Click on "Resolution Center" under "My Account" on the menu.
 On the Resolution Center page, click on the "Dispute a Transaction" button.
 On the Report a Problem page, select "Item Dispute," then click the "Continue" button.
 This is the transaction ID from step 5. Enter it under Transaction ID and click the "Continue" button when you’re done.
 Review the transaction information and make sure this is the correct seller, the correct amount, the correct item, and the correct transaction date.
 Choose between “Item not received” or “Item not as described.” Click the "Continue" button.
 Select from the drop-down list the category of the item you purchased. Compose a message to the seller. Details of the dispute will be sent to the seller for transparency.


Stick with the facts, and provide a detailed account of the transaction and the events.
Click the "Continue" button.
 You and the seller can exchange messages directly from PayPal’s Resolution Center. Whatever exchange you have here can be viewed by PayPal when the time comes.
 If you and the seller come to an agreement, you can close the dispute. Otherwise, proceed to the next steps to raise a claim.


You have 20 days upon opening of the dispute to raise it to a claim.
 By triggering this, you are saying that you and the seller can’t come to an agreement and are asking PayPal to investigate and intervene on your behalf. PayPal will then review the case and decide the outcome.


PayPal may seek additional information from you, so make sure you respond on a timely manner to avoid getting defaulted and losing the case.
 While the investigation is ongoing, PayPal will hold all funds related to the disputed transaction. Once PayPal has released its decision, you can no longer dispute against the same transaction and the case would be closed.
 If PayPal has decided on your favor, you will see the money refunded to your account.

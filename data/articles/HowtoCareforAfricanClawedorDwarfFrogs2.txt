 How often you should feed your frog will vary depending on the species. ACF tadpoles should be fed daily, while adult ACFs should be fed every 2-3 days. As ADF frogs are smaller in size, they must eat smaller quantities of food more often. Both ADF tadpoles and ADF adults should be fed 1-2 times per day., In general, ACFs and ADFs can consume the same diet. The only major difference is that ADFs must have their food broken down into much smaller pieces for them. Additionally, ADFs will consume much smaller portions.There is not an exact science to portion sizes for frogs.
Start with a small amount of food at each feeding, and gradually increase until you have an understanding for how much your frog likes to eat.
 Both ACFs and ADFs can eat pellet food for aquatic life. You can find this pellet food at any pet store. Pellet food is particularly important for tadpoles of either species, but it should also be a staple component of adult frog diets. Simply sprinkle a small amount in your frog’s tank at each feeding.You will want “sinking pellets.”
Do not feed your frogs “flake” fish food.
 Bloodworms, brine shrimp, and mysis shrimp are other staples in the diets of ACF and ADF frogs. Look for these items at your local pet store. You may find them fresh, dried, or frozen, all of which are good options for your frogs. If you have ADF frogs, be sure to break up the food into small pieces.When using frozen food, be sure to thaw beforehand.

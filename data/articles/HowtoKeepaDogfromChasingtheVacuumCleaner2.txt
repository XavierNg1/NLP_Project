 Use obedience training like the “stay” command to get your dog to stop chasing the vacuum cleaner. Tell your dog to stay in another room. Reward them with a treat when they sit and stay. Have them stay while you vacuum. Reward them again if they stay in place and do not run or chase the vacuum cleaner.


You may try having your dog “stay” outside with a treat or behind a gate or fence indoors. This may reduce the temptation for them to chase the vacuum cleaner while it’s running, even while they are sitting and staying.
 Another way to neutralize your dog and get them to stay calm while you vacuum is to instruct them to “lie down” in another room. Reward them with a treat when they lie down and tell them to “stay.” This will ensure they do not get up and chase after the vacuum cleaner.


You can also give your dog a bone to chew on while they lay down so they are not tempted to get up and chase the vacuum cleaner.
 If your dog knows the “go to your place” command, use it when you vacuum. Your dog may have a designated place or spot that they go to to relax and calm down when someone is at the door or there is commotion outside. This could be their bed, a spot on the floor, or a spot by the door. Reward your dog with a treat once they go to their place and instruct them to stay there until you call them.


This obedience trick is a good option if your dog is already comfortable with the “go to your place” command and you want to keep them away from the vacuum cleaner while it is on.

 It could also be argued that it's much more extensive than looking in a music store, you'll be able to find old single CDs as well as just albums. So, for starters, you'll need to find a trusty website to begin with. It could be best to begin with Amazon, eBay, HMV or even the artists own website.;
, Get down to actually searching for the Music CD. This is an easy task on most websites, whereas eBay (for example) may be a bit trickier as there are various sellers instead of just one company offering a CD for sale. If you're unfamiliar with eBay, you may want to read this article or simply just search elsewhere.
 This is optional because you may not find it necessary, however, if you want a bargain then you can search other websites and compare the prices. Don't forget to look at shipping prices. Is the delivery free in your region or does it double the price that you would have to pay for the CD alone (e.g. CD is £4.99, shipping is £4.95)? Find a deal that's right for you.
 If not (you haven't received the CD), you may want to deal with it appropriately depending on the payment method you used and who you bought it from.

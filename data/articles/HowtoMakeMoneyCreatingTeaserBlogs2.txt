 Traffic is key to making money creating teaser blogs. The best way to generate it is by publishing a lot of blog posts and using keywords that people search for on the Internet. This will enhance the chances of readers selecting your blog post when they're looking for information.


You can find out what keywords are popular by generating a word search on Google Adwords to find out how often they're searched. Use words that relate to your blogs.
 The companies that pay best are the ones that offer the highest amount per view or per click. You can review the pay amount, as well as the number of visitors to a site by checking your account information on each company's affiliate page. This way, you're maximizing the time you spend on selecting topics to write about and pages to link to.
 Though you might see some income in your first month, you'll probably have to blog for at least 6 months to see any real returns.
 Networking with other bloggers is a great way to generate more visitors, as bloggers often exchange links to send traffic to each other websites.

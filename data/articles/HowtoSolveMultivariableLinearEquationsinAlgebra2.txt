 In order to solve the problem, you will need to familiarize yourself with the components of the equations. Let’s use the following example to learn how to eliminate variables:


8x - 3y = -3
5x - 2y = -1

, To eliminate a variable, the numerical coefficient (the number in front of the variable) of a variable must be opposite to one another (for instance 5 and -5 are opposites). The goal is to get rid of one variable, so that you can solve for the other variable by eliminating one through subtraction. This means making the coefficients of the same variable in both equations cancel each other out.For instance:


In 8x - 3y = -3 (equation A) and 5x - 2y = -1 (equation B), you can multiply equation A with 2 and equation B with 3 so that you get 6y in equation A and 6y in equation B.
This would look like: equation A: 2(8x - 3y =-3) = 16x -6y = -6.
Equation B: 3(5x - 2y = -1) = 15x -6y =-3

, Now that you have a variable that can be eliminated, you can do so by adding or subtracting. Whether you add or subtract will depend on how you will be able to remove the variable. In our equation we would subtract, because 6y is in each of the equations:


(16x - 6y = -6) - (15x - 6y = -3) = 1x = -3. Therefore x = -3.
For other cases, if the numerical coefficient of x is not 1 after we add or subtract, we must divide both sides by the numerical coefficient to simplify the equation.
 Now that you have found what ‘x’ equals, you can plug that number into one of the original equations to solve for ‘y’.When you know that it works in one of the equations, you can try plugging it into the other equation to make sure:


Equation B: 5(-3) - 2y = -1 so -15 -2y = -1. Add 15 to both sides so -2y = 14. Divide both sides by -2 so that y = -7.
Therefore x = -3 and y = -7.
 Once you have found your variables, plug them into the original equations to make sure they are correct. If one of the equations doesn’t work with the variables you have found, you will have to try again.


8(-3) - 3(-7) = -3 so -24 +21 = -3 TRUE.
5(-3) -2(-7) = -1 so -15 + 14 = -1 TRUE.
Therefore, the variables we have found are correct.

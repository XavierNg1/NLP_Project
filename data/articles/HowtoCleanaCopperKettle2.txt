 Pour equal amounts of vinegar, salt, and lemon juice into a mixing bowl. Stir to combine thoroughly. The salt must be dissolved.









If your kettle is made of especially fragile copper or has a lacquered surface, omit the lemon juice. Its low pH might damage these surfaces., Allow the cloth to soak up the solution completely. This will ensure that the kettle is cleaned thoroughly.
 The cloth should be saturated but not dripping. If it is dripping, wring it out into the mixing bowl.
 Rub gently in sections, using circular movements. Make sure your movements are with the grain of the metal.
 Use warm water for rinsing off the cleaning agent and grime. Simply put the kettle in the sink, and allow the tap water to run over the surface.
 Use a soft dry cloth or a paper towel. Finish the cleaning, and dry the kettle.

 In the morning, splash your face a couple of times before applying a good cleanser, rinse, and then apply your moisturizer. Most skincare regimes are more advanced. Ensure your moisturizer has at least SPF 15 to keep your skin young and healthy.;
, For school, a light liquid foundation or powder-based foundation is good for natural looking skin. If you don't have spot-prone skin, or you don't feel you need foundation, apply a light powder to areas which are the oiliest or most problematic.
 Apply this with a large brush to matt all areas of the face well and to avoid patchy skin.
 You can buy these at drugstores, and if you would prefer not to use a (sometimes) expensive primer, use a concealer of similar colouring to your skin tone and blend well into the lid. You can also apply this to your under-eyes if you tend to suffer from dark circles.
 Apply loose powder gently over your primer/concealer, then take your highlight colour and apply lightly beneath your eyebrows. Then take your crease or brow bone colour and apply it lightly where you would like to have definition, and blend. I recommend a coppery brown colour, depending on your eye colour but it tends to go well with all eye colours.
 Taking the curler, clamp softly onto the base of your lashes, and repeat three times. Again at the middle of your lashes, and at the tips.
 Wipe off any excess on a tissue and wiggle at the base of your lashes, then swipe upwards for definition and separation. Apply two coats and lightly define your lower lashline with the mascara.

 Apply layers of paper towels as soon as you discover the urine stain. Stand or walk on the paper towels to increase absorbency. Try to soak up as much as possible before moving on., Mix a solution of one part white vinegar to one part water. Transfer the mixed ingredients into a spray container or cleaning bucket. Spray or pour the solution onto the area. If the area is carpeted, apply a generous amount of cleaning mixture.


You want to use enough solution to soak into all areas of the urine stain. You must be careful not to let the solution sink into the subflooring., Wait 10 minutes. Return and blot the area again with paper towels. If you have ample wash cloths, you can use these as well. It isn’t advised to use many washcloths because the ammonia can be difficult to remove., Let the area dry until it is slightly damp. Sprinkle the area with baking soda. Let the baking soda sit for 15 minutes. Baking soda is a mild alkali that dissolves dirt and grease with water effectively.Put a laundry bucket over the area while the baking soda is cleaning the area. This will prevent your pet from messing with the area.
 You should have removed the majority of the urine, which causes the release of ammonia. If the odor still smells, then you will need to treat it again to remove the remaining area or use a commercial product., The key to a commercial product is to make sure it removes the smell. Cats, especially, will urinate in the same location if they smell their urine. Buy a product that caters to your pet specially, instead of buying an "all pets" stain remover. Try to use natural products that won't be damaging to your pet or yourself.


Apply the cleaner according to package's directions. Repeat as necessary. Read the safety measures to ensure the product doesn’t contain hazardous materials.

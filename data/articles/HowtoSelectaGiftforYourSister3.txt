 Jewelry is a classic gift, as are perfumes, skincare items and clothes. Try to find out what kind of jewelry and clothing are her style, first.
 Try to hang out with her and chat, or at least ask her what her plans are. Some ideas are listed below.


Cooking: a cookbook, a gourmet hamper or a cooking gadget
Sports: a jersey of her favorite team
Gardening: a beautiful new plant
An actor: one of their movies

, A mature sister (of any age) will appreciate a heartfelt gift because of the time, thought, and love that went into making it. Perhaps you could make her a scrapbook, paint her a picture, or sew her a decorative pillow. Look on Pinterest for more ideas.
 If you're too anxious about whether your gift will be perfect or not, give her a gift card. If it is accompanied it by a nice card and a heartfelt note, even better.

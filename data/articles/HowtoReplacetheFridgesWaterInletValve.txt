 Before messing with the back, be sure to unplug the refrigerator and turn off the water supply.
 Locate the screws in the upper right hand corner of the refrigerator and use a nut-driver to remove them.

Depending on your model, there will probably be two or three screws.
When removing these screws, make sure that you don't lose them. It's highly recommended that you place them in a small plastic container.



 



, You should now be able to locate the water valve. Using your quarter-inch screwdriver, you will want to remove the machine screws that are holding the water valve to the cabinet. Once these screws have been removed, you should be able to pull the valve outside of the cavity, allowing access., Each harness will have two different pin sizes. When the pins have been removed, slightly pull the tubing out. When doing so, it's normal to see some water spill out.
 Clean up the rough edges of this tubing by cutting a bit of it off. To cut it, use a block of wood and putty knife on the floor. (Try to trim it and avoid cutting too much off.) Set this tubing aside.
 You may notice an extra piece on it; depending on the model of your refrigerator, you may or may not need this piece. If your existing piece had that additional part, keep it on. However, if it didn't, it's okay to snap it off.
 Lightly push it in to make sure that the new tubing snaps into place. When inserting the tubing, just make sure that it's firmly in place and doesn't move around when you poke at it, and that it is snug., Each pin will be a different size, so it will be impossible to mix up the connections.
 Turn on your water supply to make sure there are no leaks. If there are no leaks, you can safely put the back cover back on using those screws you set aside in the plastic container., Push into place and your water inlet valve should be working like new.

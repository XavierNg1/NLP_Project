 Pour a small amount of coconut oil into your hand. Rub the substance onto your skin gently, right over the glitter, using circular motions. The sparkly bits will loosen and dislodge. Soak a large cotton ball with water and run it over the same area of skin. This will remove the oil and get rid of any remaining pieces of glitter on your skin., Hop into the shower and pour a liberal amount of high quality olive oil into your hands. Massage the oil into your hair, taking care to work it all the way down to the scalp. Leave the oil on your hair for at least ten minutes, then rinse it out thoroughly. The glitter will wash away with the oil and your hair will feel silky smooth.If you have oily hair, apply your regular shampoo, work it into a lather, and then rinse the oil and shampoo from your hair thoroughly.
 If you’ve dropped glitter onto your carpet, get out your vacuum cleaner and use the hose attachment to suck up as much of it as possible. Do not use the attachment with the brush on the end, or the glitter will become embedded in the bristles and spread around your home.


Follow up with strips of tape to get the stubborn pieces out of the carpet.
 Get as much of the glitter up as you can by using your broom. Be sure to rinse your broom bristles out later – otherwise, the glitter will spread. Then soak a cloth with water and wipe down the flooring. The glitter should stick to the cloth. Run it under the tap to rinse the glitter off, then continue wiping the floor down until you’ve removed all of the glitter.You can use the tape method for any stubborn pieces of glitter that remain.
Use a cloth for this – don’t use your mop. The glitter will embed itself into the mop fibers and can be difficult to remove.

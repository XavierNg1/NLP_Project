 Choose two contrasting colors of duct tape to make your bow.
 Before you make the bow itself, it is a good idea to cut out a small strip of duct tape (about 0.25 inches, or about 0.64 centimeters, in width) for the centerpiece. This will make it easier to secure the bow later. Stick the strip of duct tape to the edge of a table where you can easily grab it.
 Taking the second roll of duct tape, cut out a piece 18 inches (45.7Â cm) in length. Fold it neatly in half (lengthwise), sticky sides together, leaving just a small strip of adhesive exposed at the end.
 Take both ends of the strip of duct tape and curl them upwards, to form a circle. Stick the ends together, using the small strip of adhesive that you left exposed earlier. The duct tape should now form a circular shape, like a cuff.
 Flatten the circle of duct tape and pinch the edges together, in the center, to form a bow shape.
 Take the small strip of duct tape you cut out earlier and wrap it tightly around the center of the bow to secure.
 Stick it to a headband or barrette for a funky hair piece or attach it to bags, clothing, hats, etc.

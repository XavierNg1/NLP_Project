 This is a must before you attempt the ruthless Triple Tickle. You want your opponent to have no chance of fighting back.
 Sit on his/her chest and pin down his/her arms.
 Release his arms as you do this.
 Tickle his left armpit with your left hand and his right armpit with your right hand. Remember to act quickly so your opponent doesn't have time to fight back with his free hands. He should be so weakened that he doesn't even remember that his hands are free.
 Remember that this is pretty intimate, so you shouldn't try this tickle move on someone you don't know very well.


If your opponent is shirtless, try a raspberry on his stomach.

 Prior to steaming, always wash your spinach. You want to make sure you get off any contaminants prior to consuming the plant. Place the spinach in a colander and run it under tap water until it's slightly damp. If you don't have a colander, you can simply add the spinach to a bowl and swish it around as you run water over it.Afterwards, you can pat the spinach dry with a clean paper towel. You don't need to get the spinach completely dry, but you should make sure it's not dripping wet.;
, Do not add more than two tablespoons, as there will still be droplets of water on the spinach. Make sure you choose a saucepan that can contain all your spinach. You should not have to cram the spinach into the saucepan. A saucepan that's too small will cause your spinach to not cook evenly throughout.Set the saucepan over medium heat to cook your spinach.
If you can't find a big enough saucepan, you may have to cook your spinach in two batches.
 You want to cook your spinach until it's just slightly wilted and soft. This generally takes around five minutes, but may take more or less depending on how much spinach you're cooking. Once your spinach is limp and bright green, you can remove the pan from the heat.You do not need to cover the spinach while it cooks. However, you should toss it with a pair of tongs to make sure it cooks evenly throughout.
Use a slotted spoon to transfer the spinach to a colander.
 Gently shake the colander over the sink. This should dry out any excess water. If you want, add seasonings to the spinach. Some herbs and lemon juice taste good with steamed spinach. Steamed spinach can work great as a side dish to most meals, and may pair well with something like meat if you need a vegetable.


Leftover spinach can be stored in the fridge.

 The program that TED uses for translating and subtitling, is called Amara. Amara is run on a nonprofit basis, and while it is used by TED, it is available for all types of video subtitling. Amara is designed to be easy to use, with the combined length of all four training videos clocking in at less than five minutes. The videos will explain to you how to type, sync, review, and translate, and they are located at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NxoPqYwVwo&index=1&list=PLjdLzz0k39ykXZJ91DcSd5IIXrm4YuGgE.
 There’s no limit to how many TED talks you can transcribe or subtitle. However, you can only transcribe or subtitle one at a time, and you need to finish each TED talk you translate within 30 days. Also, you have to translate at least 90 minutes of material before you can review and grade other translator’s material., TED translation is an open-source project. That means, like Wikipedia.org or wikiHow.com, that anyone can participate, and correction is outsourced to the TED translation community. So while you can submit anything you like, it is subject to review. Expect to be corrected on your mistakes!

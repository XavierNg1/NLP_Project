 Powdered eyeshadows packaged in compacts and pots are by far the most popular formulas. Because of this, powdered formulas will provide the widest range of shades and colors. If you have oily skin, or if you want to experiment with a lot of different highlighter looks, try a powdered eyeshadow formula first.
 If you have dry skin, the last thing you want to do is make it even drier. Powdered eyeshadow, just like regular face powder, can dry out your skin, emphasize wrinkles and create the least natural-looking results. Creamy eyeshadow formulas will glide onto dry skin easily and provide a natural-looking glow.








Unlike powder, cream formulas won’t collect in wrinkles and folds, which tends to emphasize these imperfections.
 Liquid eyeshadows have a similar consistency to foundation and, in some cases, may be even thinner. These formulas glide on with very little effort. They are often sold in metallic shades that can create a very dramatic highlight. If you want to create an intense glow, opt for a liquid eyeshadow formula.









Look for names that reference metallic substances, or use words like “glow” “moondust” or “glitter” on the packaging.

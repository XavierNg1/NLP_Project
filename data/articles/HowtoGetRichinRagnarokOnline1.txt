 Travel to dungeons and kill as many monsters as you can. Monsters drop Zeny when they get killed, so killing as lots of monsters could earn you hefty amount of money.;
, Monsters, when killed, can sometimes give out rare items. These items are considered rare due to their low drop rate and can be sold for ridiculous prices. For example, Poring Hats dropped by Porings (found all over the map) are often valued from hundreds of thousands, to even millions due to their low drop rate. Depending on the drop rate of the server you’re playing on, you may have to kill thousands of Porings before you get a Poring Hat. Hunting for rare items can be very tedious, but can easily give you an quick ticket into getting rich.
 Not all high-valued items are rare. Some items that are worth a ton of money have a 100% drop rate. While the item can easily be dropped, the monster that carries them rarely shows up and are very strong. Monsters like the Doppelganger, which resides inside level 3 of Geffen dungeon, only spawns once a day. The item it drops, called the Doppelganger Card, can be sold for at least a million Zeny. If you’re character is strong enough, loiter around high-level stages of dungeons and you’re sure to find some rare enemies that drop off expensive items.

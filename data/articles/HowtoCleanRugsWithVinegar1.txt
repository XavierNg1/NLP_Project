 Thoroughly vacuum both sides of the rug (front and back) to remove loose debris and dirt.;
, Combine warm water, mild dish soap and 3 to 4 cups (.7 l to .9 l) of white vinegar in a bucket.



Dip a soft cloth, soft brush or non-shedding sponge into the vinegar solution.
Scrub the pile of the rug gently, using linear motions in the direction of the nap.
Clean the fringes of the rug as applicable. If the rug has fringes along the edges, gently scrub them using a laundry brush and the vinegar solution.
 Rinse it with running water or gently wipe the surface with a clean cloth dipped in water.
 Squeeze out the excess water from the rug.


Use a window squeegee to remove excess water if the rug is too large or heavy to lift. Press the squeegee against the rug and pull in the direction of the nap until most of the water is removed.
 Allow the rug to dry outside in the sunshine. When the nap feels dry, turn the rug over to allow the other side to dry.


Allow the rug to dry under a fan If the weather doesn't permit outdoor drying.

 If an enlarged heart causes severe heart failure or significant arrhythmia your doctor may suggest you get an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The ICD is a matchbox-sized device that helps the heart maintain its normal rhythms through electrical shocks.


Your doctor may also suggest a pacemaker to help coordinate the contractions of your heart., If an impaired valve caused an enlarged heart, then your doctor may suggest replacement surgery as an option. During this procedure, the surgeon removes the narrowed or damaged valve and replaces it with another one.


These valves can be a tissue valve from a deceased human donor, a cow, or a pig. You may also receive an artificial value as well.
Surgery may also be necessary to repair or replace a leaky valve, also known as valve regurgitation. This condition, which also contributes to an enlarged heart, causes blood to leak out through the valve backwards., If your enlarged heart is due to diseased arteries you may need to have coronary stents or coronary artery bypass graft surgery to fix your heart. If you have experienced heart failure due to your enlarged heart, your doctor may suggest you have surgery to implant a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). This device will help your weak heart pump properly.


The LVAD can be a long term treatment for heart failure or as a life saving measure while you wait for a heart transplant.
Heart transplants are considered the last resort for an enlarged heart and are only considered when all other options have been ruled out. It is not easy to get a heart transplant and the waiting process can take years.

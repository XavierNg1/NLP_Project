 Separators are usually not in for long. You will usually have your separators removed at your next orthodontist appointment, when your braces will be put in place. Up until this time, you should brush your teeth back and forth after eating. Brushing your teeth up and down can easily dislodge separators., Separators should not come undone during routine brushing. However, flossing can very easily dislodge a separator. After you eat, avoid flossing in the gaps between your teeth filled by a separator., You may feel some soreness after eating when using separators. You can manage pain with over-the-counter painkillers like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and naproxen. Take the recommended dose on the bottle. This should take care of some of the pain., Separators sometimes fall out. This can be normal. Remember, separators serve to create space in your teeth for braces. If a separator falls out on its own close to your braces appointment, this means the space has been made. However, if a separator falls out 4 days or more before your appointment, call your orthodontist's office. Losing a separator this soon means you likely accidentally dislodged it via flossing, brushing, or eating. You may need your orthodontist to add a new separator.

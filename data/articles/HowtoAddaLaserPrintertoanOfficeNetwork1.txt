 Before the laser printer can be added to the network, a connection between the printer and the router or hub is needed.


Reference the operations manuals for both the laser printer and the hub or router in order to determine the connection options provided for each device.
Plug one end of the USB or Ethernet cable into an empty USB or Ethernet port on the router or hub. Insert the opposite end into an empty port on the laser printer. The Ethernet and USB ports will typically be located on the laser printer's back panel.;
, Laser printers with built in wireless technology can connect to the network without a physical connection. The name of the network and the network password will typically be required. Contact your network administrator if this information is unavailable prior to attempting to install any new devices on an office network.


Locate the laser printer's control panel. The location of the printer's control panel will vary depending on the model and the manufacturer, but it is typically located on top of the device or on the front panel.
Access the network. Locate and press the setup button on the control panel. The setup wizard will open on the control panel screen displaying the list of available wireless networks recognized by the device.
Select the correct network from the list, and use the keypad to enter the required information when prompted. Click OK to exit the setup wizard when prompted.

 At least one tab should be present to be able to reopen the accidentally closed tab.


If you close the last tab, the browser will also automatically close.
 The closed tab will reopen in a new tab window for you to view once more.


Unlike Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer, Safari will only reopen one tabâ€”the latest that you closed.

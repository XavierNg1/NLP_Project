 When someone does notice you, you want it to be for a positive reason, not because you smell bad or haven’t shaved in weeks. Try to shower and wash your hair regularly, wear deodorant, and try to look generally presentable. You don’t need to wear makeup everyday, but it’s good to put in a little effort.
 The person you like is much more likely to notice you if you’re wearing clothes that compliment you. Wearing baggy sweatpants might not be the best idea every single day. However, if they are into the sporty type maybe that is a good way to get them to notice you. Regardless, it’s a good idea to wear clothes that you think you look good in. This will make you more confident and therefore more attractive.
 For better or for worse, many people are more attracted to people who are in good shape. You don’t have to be as skinny as a super model or as muscular as an NFL player, but you should look like you take care of your body. Try to eat healthy and exercise regularly. This will have a positive impact on your general health, your confidence, and your ability to get this person to notice you.

 It may sound simple, but this is the barrier between you, your family, and potential harm. Keep your doors locked even when you’re at home, and don’t open the door unless you know who’s there.
 If you ever feel scared or like your life may be in danger, leave immediately. Don’t make the mistake of confronting an addict who is using or trying to make them see reason. Get to a safe place, call the authorities, and readdress the situation at a later time., If you notice the drug addict fighting or arguing with someone, do not intervene. Instead, call the authorities. You don’t want to unintentionally place yourself in danger.
 Don’t leave expensive items in your car or outside. While drug addicts are not necessarily thieves, many will take expensive or resalable items in order to get money for drugs.

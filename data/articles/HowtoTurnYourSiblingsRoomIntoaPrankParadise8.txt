 Several hours before, fill an ice tray with water, then drop Mento pieces into the puddles. Freeze.
 If they don't except, tell them that you "just want to spend some time with them over a coke, is that to much to ask?" When they agree, act excited and hurriedly prepare their drink. ALREADY HAVE YOUR COKE READY. They will be uncertain why you used different ice cubes, so already have your coke prepared.
 Like the effect of when you shake an unopened can, but bigger. It's hilarious!

 You may not think about your broom very much, but it's worth getting a good one.







A broad end will make for faster sweeping, since you can cover more ground in one stroke.






For outdoor jobs, especially large ones, consider using a push broom. You can cover more ground with the broad brush, and the bristles are often designed to work on outdoor surfaces, such as concrete.






For large, indoor floors, such as a gymnasium, store, or office building, try a dust mop. Available in many widths, dust mops can thoroughly clean a large area in a single pass.






Whatever implement you choose, try it out to make sure the handle length, weight, and balance work for you.;
, If you can remove furnishings, throw rugs, or other obstacles, do so. If possible, also close it off to foot traffic., Pull the broom against the floor in one direction and lift it back to that edge in the other direction.,, It helps to be systematic, working generally from one direction to another.

When sweeping outdoors, try as much as possible to sweep downhill and with the wind. It will help to avoid breathing the dust created if you are allergic or sensitive to it. If possible, avoid sweeping when it is too windy.
 Use a dustpan and either the broom or a brush. Sweep the debris into the dustpan and dispose of it in the trash. If the dustpan leaves a line right under the rim, move it back and sweep some more. When the line doesn't seem to be getting any smaller, you can either sweep that part under the rug or pick it up with a damp cloth or other means. Outdoors, you may prefer the grass catcher from a push mower, an outdoor dustpan, or a shovel or rake to collect debris.

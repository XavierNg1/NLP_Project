 A warm, friendly tone will put the potential customer at ease and help them see you as a person, not just a business transaction. If they like and feel comfortable with you as a person, they'll be more interested in doing business with you.Be sure to thank them for their offer, and speak positively about their project. Avoid making negative statements or implying that their job will be challenging or difficult for you.
 The customer typically isn't interested in the exact process or things you need to do to achieve their objective â€“ they're only interested in the finished product. Keep your language focused on the result, not the process.This is important when you're describing the work to be done. To continue the previous example, you might describe the deck-building work as "materials for new deck" and "installation of new deck." This keeps your potential customer's attention on the final product, not the work that will go into it.
 Typically potential clients want the work done sooner rather than later. Since many clients end up working with the first contractor they hear back from, you want to get your estimate into their hands as soon as possible., After you've delivered your estimate to the potential client, you may hear back from them immediately. However, you should plan to call them within two or three days after they've received the estimate to find out if they've made a decision.Keep in mind that often people who hire one contractor won't bother to call any others and tell them they've decided to go with someone else. So this follow-up is as much for you as it is for them. Knowing whether you've got the job can help you plan your work time and manage your staff efficiently.

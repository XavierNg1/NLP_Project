 Hang up black sheets on the walls using gorilla tape or tacks. There's no need to cover the ceiling, because you can turn the lights off and put up strobe lights. Get fog machines for added creepiness. You can cover your furniture with black sheets and sprinkle flour on them to make the room look old and dusty.;
, Put 1 or 2 CD players hidden behind the sheets, with creepy sound effect CDs in themâ€”no one will know where the sound is coming from. Also, to kill two birds with one stone, get sound strobe lights.
 Hallways are best for extra effects, because you can split them up into 3 or more sections, such as the effects room, spider room, skeleton room, and just plain creepy room. Or you can mix it all up to be equally creepy.
 Hallways are also useful because they're normally at the front of the house. One person can lock the door at the end, and keep it closed for a while, then let them the guests in, where the party is just starting!

 Place the lid on the blender.


You can add more ginger ale, grape juice, and ice later if desired. For now, start with the smallest suggested amounts. It is easier to add more of a flavor than it would be to subtract it.
The white grape juice is a substitute for the vodka in a traditional Wallaby Darned. The ginger ale is a substitute for the champagne.
Also note that you will use a greater amount of peach nectar to the drink than you would with a traditional Wallaby Darned. This is to make up for the lack of peach schnapps in this non-alcoholic version. Make sure that you use peach nectar and not peach juice.
 Turn the blender on, setting it to a high speed. Blend the ingredients for about 30 seconds or until the mixture becomes evenly mixed and smooth.


If large chunks of ice float to the top of the mixture, turn the blender off and use a spatula or spoon to push the chunks down toward the blades. Cover the blender before turning it on again.
 Use a straw or spoon to sample the Wallaby Darned. If you like the taste and consistency, make no further adjustments. Only add more of an ingredient if you want to make changes to the drink. After adding your adjustments, blend them in until smooth.


Add up to an extra 0.5 oz (15 ml) of white grape juice and an extra 2 oz (30 ml) ginger ale.
If you want a thicker drink, add up to another 1/2 cup (125 ml) ice.
 Once you achieve your desired flavor and consistency, pour the non-alcoholic Wallaby Darned into one or two serving glasses. Enjoy the drink immediately.

Place a straw in each serving glass.
If you do not drink this as soon as you make it, the ice can melt, and the drink will become too watery.

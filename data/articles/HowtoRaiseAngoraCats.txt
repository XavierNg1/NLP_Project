 If an Angora has one or more blue eyes, that means they could be deaf. If its right eye is blue, that means it could deaf in its right ear. If both eyes are blue, it could be completely deaf. So if your cat has blue eyes, take them to the vet to get a check up on their sight, so you can cope with the kitten accordingly.;
, Your kitten will need his first set of shots by eight weeks, and the second set three or four weeks later. If an initial veterinary exam was not done at the time of his adoption (highly recommended), he should also be tested for worms. Topical flea treatment can be started safely at eight weeks.
 The angora cats usually have medium length fur, and need to be groomed at least 3-4 times at week. This does not include bathing, you should only bathe the cat if it gets specially dirty, or for a show.
 The Angora is a lively cat and will require approximately 80 Kcals. of food per kg body weight per day (the kitten needs more). This type of cat rarely overeats and will soon let you know how much it requires each day.
 Your kitten can, and should, be spayed or neutered between three and six months. Cat's sexual maturity can vary, and both female and male kittens as young as four or five months have been known to become sexually active.
 The Angora can be very talkative, even noisy, and also very affectionate, loving to chat with its owner. Angoras are born show-offs, and love approval. They become bored easily, so need toys to occupy them, and plenty of owner participation in their games. These cats crave company; ideally this would be another cat, but otherwise from their owners, so if you are away from home for most of your day, you should ensure that your Angora has another cat for company.

Most primers are oil-based, so plain water won't be effective against them. As oil-based products, though, they are oil-soluble and can usually be lifted with the use of additional oil.
A little will go a long way, so you may only need 1 to 3 Tbsp (15 to 45 ml), even when you need to remove a large primer spot.
Vegetable oil isn't your only option, either. Most cooking oil will work just as well. Try using coconut oil, olive oil, or canola oil if all-purpose vegetable oil isn't available.;
, Mix the two oils together using your finger or a plastic spoon.


This step is not strictly necessary, and you should be able to remove primer from your skin with only vegetable oil and no essential oil. The lemon oil can make the process slightly more effective, though, since the mild acid in the lemon oil can help cut through the primer without harming your skin.
 Pour the oil mixture directly over the primer spot on your skin. Use your fingers to scrub the area until you see the oil mixture turn white.


The oil mixture will turn white when it has picked up most of the white primer.
You could also use a clean rag to apply the oil mixture and scrub away the primer, but be prepared to sacrifice the rag since you won't be able to remove the primer from the cloth if it stains.
 Rinse away the whitened oil mixture, then wash the spot thoroughly with soap and water.


The soap should help attract any additional oil-based residue left behind from the primer and the oil-based cleanser.
Scrub well until you no longer feel any oil on your hands. Rinse once more, then dry your hands.
 Usually, most of the primer will be gone after a single round of scrubbing with this oil-based cleanser. If some stubborn stains still remain, though, simply go through the process again to remove them.

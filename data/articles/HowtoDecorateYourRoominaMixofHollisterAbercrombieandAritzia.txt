 If your parents decide to walk into your room and it's completely different, they probably won't like it. This would also be a good time to figure out your budget.;
, If you can/want to, put in dark hardwood floors.
 Abercrombie's walls are gray/black. Hollister's are brown, and Aritzia's vary from store to store, although they're usually darker colours.
, If not, try to get a dark wood bed, desk, and side table.
 It'd be nice if it had wood or leather, but it doesn't really matter.
, Also, add on between 4 and 10 pillows onto your bed and seats, if applicable.
 You could put in artwork similar to the art in Aritzia (nature-y things. eg. wooden mushroom stools, flower paintings), a collage of the Abercrombie bags (the ones you get when you buy something- shopping bags), or cut up the totes from Hollister and frame them. Something to really make your room look like a store would be to buy a mannequin

, You can find this on their website.
 Add in some things that you like, such as pictures or trophies, as well as a mirror.
 What a lovely room you have!

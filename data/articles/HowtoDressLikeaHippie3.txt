 Though hippies made a point of going barefoot, they often wear flat sandals when this isnâ€™t practical. After all, no shirt, no shoes, no service.


The sandals most often associated with hippies are Birkenstocks. They have cork bottoms and leather upper material.
Try also leather flip flops. They're easy to put on and pull off and look great with dresses and skirts.
 Especially in colder weather, or if you want to dress up your outfit, you can try on some boots. Hippie boots are generally suede or leather and could almost pass for booties in a pinch.
 Any style of moccasins will work, but they should be comfortable. Many moccasins will have bead work on parts of the shoe.

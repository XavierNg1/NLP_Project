 The starting position is also known as the catch. In this position, your arms should be straight out in front of you and your shoulders should be level. Lean your upper body forward but keep a straight back. Bend your knees and keep your shins as vertical as possible., Push off with your legs and use them to propel yourself backward. Once your legs are extended, bump your hips up. Pulling with your arms in the beginning of the drive will make your rowing less efficient and you'll get tired faster., Bend your arms and pull your hands back to your chest while leaning back so that you can get the most power out of your drive. This is called the finish position.Your hands should come to the bottom of your chest at the end of each drive.
 After the finish, you enter the recovery stage. Don't rush your recovery by aggressively pushing forward. Instead, concentrate on developing a healthy pace rather than expending unneeded energy. Calm your muscles and allow your body to return to the starting position.It's called the recovery stage because you should be exhaling and resting your muscles for a short period.
The idea behind getting faster is setting a good pace, not frantically trying to pull back as fast as you can during every stroke.
 Make sure to inhale during this time and exhale as you pull backward. Taking short breaths will cause you to become tired faster, and will reduce the speed of your stroke over time. Regulate your breathing by inhaling deeply through your nose and exhaling out of your mouth.

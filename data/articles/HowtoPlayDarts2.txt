 Leaning forwards or backwards is tempting, but offers the thrower less stability than if he/she were to stand upright.


For right-handed players, keep your right foot in front and your left foot in back. Most of your weight should be resting on your right foot, although you don't want to be leaning forward excessively.
For left-handed players, keep your left foot in front and your right foot in back. Most of your weight should be resting on your left foot, although you don't want to be leaning forward excessively.
 You will want to keep your balance throughout the throw. Otherwise, you may pull or push the dart off in an unintended direction.
 Take the dart in your dominant hand's palm and run it through your fingers until you find the center of gravity. Put your thumb a bit behind the center of gravity while placing at least two, and possible four, other fingers on the dart. Do what feels comfortable for you.
 Any extraneous movement here means that the dart will not fly straight.
 Do not throw too hard, it is unnecessary and dangerous.


Darts do not need a great deal of force to stick into the dartboard. Remember, the goal of the game is to score points, not determine who is strongest.

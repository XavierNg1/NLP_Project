 Studies show that when an employee feels excluded, they may engage in acting out behaviors to get noticed. Examples might include cutting co-workers out of projects, cheating, lying, or aggressively competing. If you are tempted to behave this way, think about the possible repercussions first. Acting out will only make you feel more excluded, and it could jeopardize your job too., Chances are you could be disengaged from work because you no longer feel challenged. Simply because your job description doesn't entail any lofty accomplishments or goals doesn't mean you canâ€™t strive for them. Create your own personal goals to work towards. This could be just what you need to feel passionate about your work and reconnect with the group.


For example, you might aim to get so many reports done by 5pm each day. Or, you might develop a track to move towards a promotion or transfer to a new company.Try to focus on what you can control and avoid trying to control things that are outside of your control.
 If the work you do and the people you do it with leave you feeling lackluster, you could be in the wrong career. If you have to change the way you act, undermine your values, or fantasize about leaving your job each day, pay attention to these cues.The culture of your workplace is just as important to your satisfaction as the actual position and salary. It may be time to quit. Re-examine why you got onto this career path or took this job.

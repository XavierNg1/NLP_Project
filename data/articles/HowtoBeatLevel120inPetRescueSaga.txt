 If you really want to start strong, use some boosters. On the pre-game screen, select the boosters you want to equip for the game.


You may have to shell some gold bars if you don’t have a particular booster you want to use.;
, Once you’re in, analyze how your board is laid out. Locate the pet. Identify the key’s location. See how the bomb can be used. Look for long connected blocks of the same color for huge points.
 You won’t know how your board will look like after several moves. However, you have control over your first few moves. Plan them out properly to get huge points and to bring the pet down several rows. Make use of the key and the bomb available in this level.
 This isn’t a time-limited level, so you don’t have to hurry. Take a good look of the whole board before each move.
 You start the level with just the one pet. Work on getting it lower by clearing out the blocks under it. The pet sits on top of a metal box, so you have to bring both of them down.
 Bring down the glass case that holds the key by clearing out the blocks under it. Bring it to the ground to free the key, but don’t use it yet.
 This level has some infected blocks in play. The infected blocks grow after each move, converting another block near it to be an infected block as well. Take them all out at once for some huge points.
 Bring the bomb to the bottom as well. It should be located right beside the pet and the metal box. Clear out the metal box by using the bomb at this point.
 At this point, the pet should be sitting on top of a locked block. Use the key you freed up from Step 2 to break the locked blocks. The pet will fall to the bottom and you’re done.

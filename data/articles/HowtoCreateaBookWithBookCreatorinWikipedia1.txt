 Choose your native language. You could also choose a language that you're good at.
 Note that it's also possible to create a book without having an account.
 Click on "Print/export". Then, click on "Create a book".


If you don't want to create a book anymore, click on "Cancel".
You will be redirected to the page you were on before. This time, the book creator tool will appear on the top. You can click on several things:





If you want to save the page you're at to your book, simply click on "Add this page to your book".
If you want to see your book, click on "Show book (__pages)". The number before "pages" show how many pages you saved to your book.
If you want the tool to suggest you pages, click on "Suggest pages". It won't work if you haven't added any pages yet, because the suggestions are based on the set of pages you choose to save in your book.
If you were on a page that linked to another page, you could add this page to your book quickly. Hover on that link, then a small box will pop up with "Add linked wiki page to your book". Click on it, and it will be saved to your book.

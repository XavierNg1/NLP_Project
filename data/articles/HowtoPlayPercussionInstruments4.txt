 The proper grip for mallet percussion instruments like the marimba, the xylophone, and the glockenspiel is a variation on the matched grip. Instead of pinching the mallet between your thumb and forefinger to create the fulcrum, squeeze the butt of the mallet gently with your ring finger and pinky. Your other 3 fingers are then wrapped loosely around the mallet to provide extra control., Each mallet percussion instrument requires a different type of mallet to sounds its best and remain undamaged. The marimba is played with soft yarn mallets, the vibraphone with hard yarn mallets, the xylophone with rubber or plastic mallets, and the glockenspiel with plastic or brass mallets., Unlike other percussion instruments, whose parts are not duplicated in the rest of the ensemble, mallet percussion parts often duplicate passages that are being played by wind or string instruments. For this reason, it is important to listen carefully to the ensemble and try to blend well with the other instruments playing your part.

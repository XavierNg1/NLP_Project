 Avoid distractions and focus on the taste of your food. Eat slower to allow your brain plenty of time to receive the signal that you are full. It can take up to 20 minutes for your brain to send out this signal.If you're full you'll snack less and eat smaller portions., Studies show that you can slow down your eating by setting down your fork and knife between every bite. You might even consider the SmartForks, a new electronic fork that tells you how long it took to eat your meal, the amount of “fork servings” taken per minute, and the intervals between “fork servings.”, Chewing your food many times will make you feel fuller. Eating slower gives your food more time to break down and release more flavors. Chewing also aids digestion. Chew more, eat slower, and soon you’ll be snacking less.

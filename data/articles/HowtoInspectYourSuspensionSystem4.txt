 In order to conduct a bounce test you need to remove any variables that could affect how the vehicle recovers from being bounced. Soft or uneven ground can affect how the vehicle sits, giving you a less reliable outcome.Blacktop or concrete are the preferred surfaces to conduct this test on.
An uneven surface will shift the weight of the vehicle, causing the suspension to respond differently than it would otherwise.
 The bounce test requires that you compress the suspension of the vehicle and assess how it recovers. In order to do so, place both of your palms on a stable part of the front of the vehicle (the hood will suffice) and press down with all of your weight. Take your hands away and watch the vehicle as it rises again.Press on the hood near the very front of the car to prevent putting a dent in it.
If you are unable to put enough pressure on the vehicle to compress the suspension, ask a friend to help.
 After releasing the vehicle, it should bounce back up and right itself in a single bounce. If it bounces a few more times as it settles, the shock absorbers in the front of your vehicle are likely bad.Even if you push down on the hood several times before releasing it, it should still right itself with only one bounce.
 Once you have assessed the front suspension, move to the rear of the vehicle and repeat the process by pressing down on the trunk lid. Like the front, the rear suspension should be able to right itself after a single bounce.If the vehicle bounces a few times before settling again, take it to a professional to have the shock absorbers looked at.
Do not press down on spoilers or fins, as they are often made of fiberglass and will break under pressure.

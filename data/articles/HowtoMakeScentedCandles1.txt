 There is a wide variety of choices, but not all of them will align with your personal preferences. Some are commercially produced from chemicals, some come from plants, while others are based on essential oils. The origin of the scent may impact your choice to use it, especially if you're concerned about chemicals in your home environment. Typical sources of scenting candles include:


Commercial candle making scents: These are in liquid form and are available from most stores that sell candle making supplies. The strength of the scent will vary from brand to brand and whether or not you have access to a full list of ingredients will depend on the manufacturer's willingness to provide this. Expect to use about 1 ounce of liquid scent to every 2 pounds of melted wax.
Fragrance oils: These are 100% synthetic and are not specifically made for candles but usually still work for scenting them. The same issues as the commercial scents apply. Most are highly concentrated, so use of these should be sparing. Expect to use about 10-15 drops of fragrance oil per 1 pound of melted wax.
Essential oils: These are produced naturally from plants such as herbs and flowers. They have specific properties, which can be found by doing an online search or using a book on essential oils. Not all essential oils will work well with wax, so you may need to do a test first. Expect to use about 10-15 drops of essential oil per 1 pound of melted wax.
Natural sources of scent: This covers such things as crushed or powdered plants, spices and herbs, finely ground zest, etc. Some work really well with melted wax, such as ground cinnamon, crushed lavender flowers or finely ground lemon zest. Others may not meld as well though, or can stop the wax from turning hard or prevent the wick from burning, so do your research first. Expect to use about 1 teaspoon of ground spice, herb or zest per 1 pound of wax.;

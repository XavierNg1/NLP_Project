 If you ask for a real egg (the egg used in their McMuffin sandwiches) you can instantly improve a regular breakfast item that would normally come with something inferior without having to pay the extra money.
 Say you would like the value item prepared in the manner of the entree it's supposed to mirror. Although you may have to pay extra for the added toppings, it will still come up as less than what you would have paid for the real deal.



The most well-known value item stack is the "McGangbang", a McDonalds item where you place a dollar menu Junior Chicken inside a McDouble.
 By customizing your order, you can help ensure that your meal is as fresh as possible.
 Fast food joints salt their fries by default. If you specifically ask to have them without salt, they'll have to make a fresh batch specifically for you. Because fry batches are typically left in a warmer, getting fresh fries is an easy way of improving your dining experience without paying anything more. You can always add salt to the fries manually if you want them.


Keep in mind that this won't get you in the good graces of the restaurant staff, especially if you come in and do this on a regular basis. It means more work for the staff, so only do this if you're really intent on fresh fries.
 "Hacking" the menu like this means you can create a ton of combinations on your own, like egg on a cheeseburger.

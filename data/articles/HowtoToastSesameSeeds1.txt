 If you don't see any dust or small pebbles in your sesame seeds, you can put them directly in a skillet or frying pan. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for two to three minutes or until the seeds turn brown, glisten, and occasionally pop or jump.Do not add oil to the skillet.
For a nuttier flavor, try the longer thorough toasting method instead.;
, Alternatively, you can preheat the oven to 350ºF (175ºC), and spread the seeds onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake until lightly browned, shaking the pan gently every few minutes to spread the heat more evenly.This typically takes eight to fifteen minutes, depending on how thick the layer of sesame seeds is.


Use a baking sheet with deep sides to avoid spilling.
Sesame seeds can burn very quickly if the heat gets too high. Stay in the kitchen and don't forget to check frequently.
 Once the seeds are done toasting in either method, transfer them to a cool baking sheet and let them cool to room temperature. They will cool faster on metal than plastic or glass surfaces.

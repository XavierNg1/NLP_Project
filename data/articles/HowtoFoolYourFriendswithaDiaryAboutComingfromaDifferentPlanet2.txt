 School, your friends house, the movies, etc. Your friends will wonder why you take it to so much places.
 Leave the key there if it has to be unlocked. They may read it.
 Such as, "I hope you don't find out about the plans," or, "Yes, Flame? I mean, (your friend's name)?" If they press at it, ask them if they read the diary and to please tell the truth. If they said yes, sigh and say, "Thank you for telling me the truth." and hold your diary with you. If they say no, say, "Oh thank goodness!"

, Keep trying for at least 2-3 months. If they don't, say, "It may be time for you to know." Hand them the diary and let them read it. If they laugh at you, take your diary and leave. No need to say goodbye. They'll know they hurt your feelings, if you leave. If they act serious about it, start talking about your planet. If it goes way too far though, or if your friend is scared and crying about the Magnolians, tell them it was a harmless trick and no one is coming to Earth.

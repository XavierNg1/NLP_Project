 When first meeting a girl, a handshake is enough. Don’t crowd up against her, bring your face near hers, or touch inappropriate areas such as the face. As you build your relationship, use your judgment as to how much physical contact is welcome. Start with gentle hand and shoulder brushes during conversations and standing close during opportune times such as parties and concerts.If you desire a relationship, ramp up your contact as you go. Then you can try hugging and flirting if she is okay with it.
Never touch a girl when this is unwanted. Respect her personal boundaries and pull back when she is uncomfortable.
 Behave with grace around girls. Inappropriate actions including swearing, farting, or telling rude jokes are sure to make a girl not want to be around you. In addition, hold open the door and say please and thank you to show respect.
 Talk to everyone — boys, trans people, and so on — the same way you’d talk to a girl. Show everyone respect and kindness and you listen to what they have to say. Avoid starting fights. When girls are around, they’ll see this and consider you to be a mature and genuine person.This is hard to do when arguing or encountering someone you don’t like, but try to avoid outbursts of emotion. Breathe deeply and control what you say.
 Talking badly about someone who isn’t present has the same effect as an unpleasant confrontation in-person. Avoid gossiping. Sharing negative information will make you look immature to girls and cause them to wonder if you talk about them too when they’re not around. Continue to be respectful as much as possible.


In return, don’t speak negatively about girls or share their secrets with your friends. This information may get back to them and give you a bad reputation.

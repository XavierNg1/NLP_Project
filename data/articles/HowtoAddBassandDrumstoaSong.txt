, Do this by counting the beats in the bar. Most songs are written in 4/4(you can count to four in a musical bar), or 3/4 (three beats).
 It is not very important to have the exact chord(E9 instead of E11 for instance), as long as you know the tonic (or main chord tone). This tends to be the lowest note in the chord, and the chord is named after that tone. For example, the tonic of an E Major Chord is E.
,, If you don't play drums yourself or don't have recording options nearby, use a drum machine (you may find free software on the internet which imitates a drum machine). Either you can use pre-programmed beats, which often works very well, or program it yourself. Most songs favor drum patterns which have the bass drum hitting on beats one and three, snare drum on beats two and four, and hi-hat or ride cymbal on all four beats, often doubling the hits for more rock-influenced music.
 Do this by using either a bass guitar or a keyboard on the darker half of the keys. If you want it simple, the best approach would be to let the bass play the tonic of the chord, if you like to spice things up, you can use notes from whatever chord being played at that beat. The rhythm of the bass is crucial, beyond telling people what chords they are listening to, the bass usually plays together with the drums to establish the groove. A simple way is to let bass play at the same beats as the bass drum. Another is just playing 8th notes(two notes per beat) for Ã¥ more driving groove.
 Find out how the rhythm section of the song should affect the grove and feel. By using dynamics and spicy notes, one can create songs that have depth of dimension just by adding very basic elements.

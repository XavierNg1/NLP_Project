 Relationships go wrong for a whole lots of reasons. Take an honest look at yourself and see what part you played the first time you met him. If it was your fault that things went sour, go ahead and try to get him back. If he never treated you well, why do you even want him back? Maybe you really are better off without him.;
, O.k., you've thought it through and you can't live without him. Somewhere along the way he lost interest in you. Were you mean to him? Maybe you were too nice.

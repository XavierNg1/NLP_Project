 You want to be 100% that the car is unable to move before you start working.
 Use a flat-head screwdriver and lightly pull at certain spots until you feel the cap wiggle loose.


If something feels like it will break or snap, stop and move to another spot.
You may have to loosen a few areas to get it off.
 Keep prying to pop the old hubcap off.
 Line it up with the old one, noting where the little whole or cutaway is for the valve stem.
 It will not be secure yet.
 Lightly tap it into place, working all the way around the rim to perfect it. You should here light "clicks" as it pops in.

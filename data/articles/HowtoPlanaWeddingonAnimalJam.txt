, Try to get bridesmaids, and a best man. If you have parents, invite them.
 This could be nature, fanciful, glitzy, romantic, wintry, summery, etc.
 Also you might want a big, but not too big, den like the restaurant or the tree house.


Make the den pretty with flowers, ponds, pets, and white decor. Use wallpaper and floor (if possible).
 Trade a cake like item or you could trade for the second birthday cake.
 For girls, designer skirt and a flower crown or tutu and flower crown will be better. For boys, camouflage boots and a tuxedo and maybe even a hat with a feather.


If you're a girl and a nonmember, choose a head flower, lei( any necklace), star cap and patched shoes.
If you're a nonmember boy choose chained necklace, patched shoes, old blanket (any nm blanket) and knight helmet. For boy\girl members wear a tuxedo, earrings, and type of shoes, designer skirt, and any necklace or hat.
 Golden ones work best.
 Wait until at least all your friends and family members arrive before doing anything.


If it is a public wedding, go to Jamaa township and yell, "wedding! my den!"

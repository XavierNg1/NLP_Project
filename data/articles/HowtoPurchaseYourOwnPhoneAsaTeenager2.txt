 Go onto your best local service provider's website and search for a phone. Make sure the phone suits all of your needs, and has any functions that your parents request. Maybe you're busy with an internship and need blue-tooth for hands-free calling, you travel a lot and need GPS, or your parents have requested parental controls - make sure the phone you want has these.


The advanced search option found on most sites can help you find a phone in your price range, and the type you want (flip, slide, touchscreen, etc).
 Find more information about the phone, such as features, versions, model, size, quality, battery replaceable, etc. It can also be of great help to check owner reviews, unboxing videos, hands-on/first impression reviews, and in-depth reviews.


Keep the size of the phone in mind - a man can fit most sizes in his pocket, but a woman who doesn't wear a purse will have to pick a phone that fits in hers.
 Make a checklist of features and functions you want, and make a mark for every one the phone has. This will be great for the presentation of the phone to your parents. At the same time, write down other features and functions that you hadn't thought that would be useful in your phone.


Depending on how tech-savvy you are, the ability to use a phone varies. You might want a simple Nokia phone or an iPhone, depending on how well you think you can adapt to using it.
 Keep in mind 1) the price of the phone and 2) the cost of data. Depending on the phone, a phone can cost anywhere from 20 dollars to 600 dollars, and data can cost a ton! If you use lots of data, you may want a cheaper phone and vice versa. However, remember that not only will you have to pay for the phone, but you might have to pay for the data as well. Find a cost that's right for you.

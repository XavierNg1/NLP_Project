 The double/triple stake method is useful for trees with balled or burlapped roots to prevent it from rocking back and forth in the wind. You’ll need 2-3 stakes of the same size. They should be roughly ⅓ of the height of the trunk. Acquire 2-3 ties that are broad and smooth for attaching the tree to the stake., Place your stakes at an angle about 15–18 inches (38.1–45.7 cm) from the trunk on opposite sides. Make sure that the stakes are buried deep enough in the ground that they do not give when pushed against.This will help to keep the tree stable in poor weather and storms.
 Attach each tie about ⅓ of the way up the stem so the tree will have some flexibility to give in response to the wind.You want the tie to be firm, but with some give to it.
 Make sure to remove the stakes after one growing season. If the tree’s root system moves in the soil when you remove the stake system, leave it in for an additional season.

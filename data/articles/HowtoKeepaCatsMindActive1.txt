 Cats thrive on routine, and physical activity is strongly linked to good mental health. By making play an important part of your catâ€™s daily routine, you increase the chances of them staying active later in life. Keep your cat physically active and mentally engaged from the time they are a kitten.Aim to play with your cat for 30 minutes, ideally at the same time each day.You might try:


Dangling some string.
Tossing jingly balls for your cat to chase.
Dragging a ribbon on the floor.;
, An unorthodox, but effective, option is to walk your cat outdoors on a leash. This provides your cat with quality exercise, while stimulating their visual, olfactory, and aural senses. Although some cats will not cooperate with leash-walking, others take it to it very well. Try putting a harness on your cat and taking them for a walk!If you can is unwilling to walk, don't force them.
If you cat grips the ground, meows incessantly, or seems otherwise stressed, bring your cat back inside and try again another day.
 Overweight cats are less likely to engage in both mental and physical stimulation as they get older. As such, it is crucial to try and keep your cat at a healthy weight. To encourage exercise and problem-solving at the same time, try placing their food bowl at the top of the stairs or at the top of a cat tree.Always select the food appropriate for your cat's age. Your vet can help you decide.
For every 8 lbs. of a cat's weight, they should eat 4/5 of a cup of dry food per day.

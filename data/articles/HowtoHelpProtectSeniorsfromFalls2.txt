 If you are in a snowy or icy environment, make sure sidewalks and steps are cleared of snow and ice as much as possible, and salted heavily to help provide better traction. Senior individuals living independently can request the service of neighbors, loved ones, or their city to help keep their outdoor environment clear.If you help care for a senior individual, offer to come over and help them clear areas such as their sidewalk and driveway and put down salt during the winter.
 The proper shoes and canes or walkers can help keep a senior citizen more stable when they are out of the house. Make sure that walkers and canes have rubber bottoms to help keep traction, and that the senior individual wears rubber-soled shoes with grips.Applying tennis balls to the front two legs can help the walker slide across carpeting without sticking, and potentially unbalancing the user.


Quality rubber soled shoes can often be found for a reasonable price from many shoe stores, and are often sold as work shoes.
Ask a doctor or medical professional for recommendations on proper walking assistants for outdoor use.
Visit a medical supply store for more ideas and suggestions on products that could be used.
 If there is an area that is known to have a great number of cracks, potholes, or other uneven surfaces, seniors should be advised to avoid that area until it is complete. Major hazards should be reported to the city for immediate repair.If a nearby park or walking path is not suitable for the safety concerns of a senior, help them find a new outdoor area that they can easily access on foot or through provided transportation.
Report any major potholes or tripping hazards near a senior citizenâ€™s home to local government immediately and request that the area be repaired as soon as possible for the safety of the senior resident.

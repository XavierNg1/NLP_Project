 Singing to your baby will not only improve your baby’s mood, it will also strengthen your bond and aiding in your child’s development. Don’t be shy to sing to your baby. They cannot tell if you are a bad singer or tone deaf.Never use headphones on your baby.
 When you are trying to sooth your baby through bouncing and rocking, try hushing or “sh”ing your baby. These noises simulate the noises of the mother’s womb and can provide your baby a lot of comfort.
 White noise also reminds babies of their mother’s womb. Your baby was used to hearing noises, like a heartbeat and people talking, while they were in the womb. It can be difficult for some babies to fall and stay asleep when it is completely quiet. White noise machines can also block out any other noise that may jar your baby.Do not turn up the volume of the machine too much. Also, make sure that the machine is not within reach of your baby’s crib.

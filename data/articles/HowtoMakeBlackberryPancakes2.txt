 Separate the yolk from the white. Beat the egg white until it's stiff. Then set aside.
 Set aside to cool just a little.
 Add the blackberries when the batter is formed, doing so gently to avoid breaking them up too much.
 Stir through quickly.
 Cook over medium heat.


Alternatively, use a non-stick pan and cook without any added fat.
 When browned, remove from the heat.
 Add a dollop of whipped cream or ice cream and a few uncooked blackberries. Or, pour over a favorite syrup (and still add the uncooked blackberries).

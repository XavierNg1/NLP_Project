 Buy them fresh and without signs of wilting any time soon so that your Valentine can appreciate them more.
 Make sure you sign it with your name if you want your Valentine to know you sent it because otherwise they might think someone else sent it. To make that amazing person feel even more special, get a card that is personalized. You can get personalized cards on the Internet and in certain shops that sell them, but make sure you do this at least two days in advance. You don't want your Valentine to be getting a card a week later!

, You don't want the flowers being sent to their grumpy old neighbour! Try to do this in such a way that they don't suspect your plan. Act naturally as you ask them for it by saying that you could drop over at their house at the weekend or something along those lines.
 Alternatively, you could get a friend or family member to turn up at their house. Choose anyone so long as it isn't yourself. The appearance of you at their house is too obvious and clichéd. You could be watching the delivery from nearby but to add that romantic feel, don't let yourself be seen.
 They might call you first. Ask them if they liked your present and be prepared for their smile to be lit up as they thank you for your lovely gift.

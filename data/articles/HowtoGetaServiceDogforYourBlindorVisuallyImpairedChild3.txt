 Your new service dog will need a space in your home when it becomes a member of your family. You should buy the dog a bed, food and water bowls, a collar, and a leash. You will need to set up the dogâ€™s bed in the same room that your blind or visually impaired child sleeps.
 Service dogs, also referred to as guide dogs, are bred and trained to assist blind or visually impaired people. However, they must exercise their skills daily or they can lose them.These tasks can include crossing the street, locating objects, and alerting the child to danger such as a moving car.
The child will need to perform these tasks with the dog whenever possible.
 A service or guide dog requires daily care. You and your family will need to be able to dedicate ample time for feeding and grooming. The dog will also need regular daily exercise. This is especially important if the dog is an active breed like an Australian Shepherd or Border Collie.

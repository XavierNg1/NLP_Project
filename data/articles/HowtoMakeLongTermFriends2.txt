 This is important since some people approach you based on your looks. If you seem clean and tidy, your classmates won't hesitate to talk to you.
 It'll help her/him feel more comfortable when talking to you. It'll also show that you are a friendly person.
 That way people will trust you and not look at you as some stalker.
 Ask questions and give some information about yourself. Keep the conversation light and friendly so that people find you easy to talk with. Keep it short unless you really have the conversation going, to avoid awkward silences.

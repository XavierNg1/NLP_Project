 No matter what, just that one lens. Make it work. If it's a zoom, pick a focal length and stick with it. You will learn that focal length and a lot more about composition. (If you can't do it for the weekend, try it for a day).;
, It will help, considerably, to use Aperture Value or Aperture Priority (or whatever they call it).
, Stay completely out of any of the programmed modes., (You might want to make sure your vision is good or your diopter is set correctly.)

, If you have a backup, or one that you don't use often, use it. (This is really only helpful if you also shoot with film).
 Some rules are:Rule of Thirds
Balancing Elements
Leading Lines
Symmetry and Patterns
Viewpoint
Background
Depth
Framing
Cropping

, Get some practice in. Something like panning or freezing action, etc.
 Practice using it with various subjects and angles.

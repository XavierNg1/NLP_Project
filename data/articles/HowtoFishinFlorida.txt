, The Florida panhandle's gulf coast offers good fishing in the spring for cobia, red fish, Spanish and king mackerel, and pompano, while the flats near the Florida Keys offers year round fishing for bonefish, and nearby inshore waters offers great snook fishing. Other species and fishing opportunities are:


Catfish can be caught in freshwater canals, rivers, creeks, and lakes statewide, and year around.
Largemouth bass are usually sought in rivers and lakes in warm weather, so fish the southern part of the state year around, and the panhandle from spring through fall.
Bream and other panfish can be caught in almost any body of water where sufficient food and oxygen are present.
 Florida requires either a saltwater or freshwater fishing license for persons 16 years old or older. Exemptions are for those over age 65, military personnel on duty in Florida less than 6 months, and disabled individuals. These people should get a free fishing permit from an office of the local tax collector prior to going fishing. You also will not be required to have a fishing license if you are fishing from the bank on freshwater lakes and streams that are not in a state management area, using a cane pole.
 Once you have selected the type of fishing you plan on doing, get the bait and tackle you will need to go fishing. You can find out specific suggested methods from local bait and tackle shops, or look for advertisements from guide services in the area you are planning to visit.
 Some larger lakes and rivers are more easily fished using a boat. There are special regulations for operating a boat in Florida, including limits on where gasoline motors can be used and safety equipment requirements.

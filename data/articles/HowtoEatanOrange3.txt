 The water in the orange will help re-hydrate your body, while the carbs and potassium will help restore energy.Consider pairing the orange with a hard boiled egg. Eggs contain fatty acids that prevent and reduce inflammation damage.
 Oranges are high in vitamin C, as well as other vitamins. They help improve your immune system, and protect you against viruses and infections, including the common cold.
 Oranges help build collagen, which helps make your skin more elastic. This, in turn, helps reduce wrinkles and make skin appear younger. It also helps even out skin texture.
 Oranges are low in fat but high in fiber, making them the perfect diet food, as well as an ideal snack for those struggling with high cholesterol and diabetes.
 While eating is good for you, eating too many is not. The more you eat does not mean that you will lose weight faster, or get over a cold faster. Limit yourself to one orange a day. Eating too many oranges can lead to digestion problems, including stomach cramps and diarrhea.

 Scour the entire area of the PVC pipe to roughen up the slick exterior. This will help color settle into the plastic more easily. Use a consistent pressure and stroke length to get an even finish.








Think twice before using an electric sander. This can shave away too much of the PVC.
 Clear away as much dust and grit as you can. Let the acetone dry for 20-30 minutes. Be sure to wear gloves and work in a well-ventilated space during this part.









Rewet the cloth as needed to cover the area you sanded.
Try not to oversaturate the PVC. Too much acetone may eat away at the plastic, weakening its structure., Brush on a light layer of primer, working lengthwise from end to end. Primer is indispensable for encouraging paint to stick to surfaces that are otherwise too smooth to hold it. A single coat should be enough to do the trick.








Look for primer in a basic matte white. This will be versatile enough to make any shade of paint show up clearly and vividly.
 Once again, apply the paint in long, smooth strokes from one end to the other, the same way you did the primer. Turn the PVC as you go, painting overlapping stripes until you you’ve covered every edge.








Use a small, soft-bristled brush not much wider than the pipe.
Look for paints that will mimic the waterproofing effect of PVC, like a semigloss satin, latex or acrylic., You may need to layer on multiple coats before the color really starts to show. The color will darken and deepen with each subsequent coat. When you’re done, leave the PVC to dry for 24-48 hours. Afterwards, you’ll have a vibrant, resilient section of plastic piping to put to use in just about any project imaginable!








Most paint jobs will require an average of 2-3 separate coats.
Be careful not to apply the paint so heavily that it creates visible drips.

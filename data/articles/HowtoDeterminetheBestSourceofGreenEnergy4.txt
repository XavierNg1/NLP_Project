 This is basically about harnessing the heat from under the Earth and people have been using it for thousands of years, such as through hot springs. Heat pumps can be used to bring heat back up from the Earth and back into it to warm and cool your house.
 It can be done in many places of the world, but not everywhere is suitable, so you'll need to find out about your own area first. Realize that the initial set-up will likely be costly but with free heating and cooling thereafter, from a very reliable source, it may well work out to be ideal, especially if you plan on living in the same place for a long time.

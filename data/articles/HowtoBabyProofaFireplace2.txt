 If you have a hearth that extends past the fireplace exterior, you will need to purchase a larger fireplace gate than if you did not have a hearth.


Fireplace gates ensure that your child is unable to reach the hearth where they can be seriously injured if they fall, especially on the sharp corners of a raised step hearth or fall on the hard material of a flat hearth. .
 If you have a hearth with a raised edge you will need to baby-proof the hard corners and edges of the ledge.A hearth pad is made of flame retardant material that runs along the corners and edges of the entire hearth. Hearth pads are usually attached to the hearth with glue or double sided tape, often referred to as hearth clamps., If you have a flat hearth, you can use interlocking floors, like those many parents use for play areas, to soften the hard stone and brick.


You should avoid using interlocking floors on the hearth when the fireplace is in use unless the floor material is flame retardant and does not retain heat.
The foam of the interlocking floors can help soften a child's fall on to the hard stone or brick of a flat hearth.
 If you do not use your fireplace you can add cushions or padding directly on top of the stepped or flat hearth to soften the area.


Never use hearth cushions if the fireplace is in use, as this is a serious fire hazard.
Hearth cushions can be a decorate way to hide the stone or brick of the hearth and to make it more comfortable for a child to sit on.
Do not encourage your child to sit on the hearth, as this encourages them to treat the hearth and fireplace as a play area when it really is a dangerous place to play.

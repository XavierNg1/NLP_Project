 In order to help your stomach digest the food you eat, try to chew your food as thoroughly as possible before swallowing. Softer foods are easier to digest. While there is no magic number for how long you should chew food for, you should try to chew your food until it is almost completely broken down before swallowing., Six small, frequent meals can be easier on your stomach than three large meals a day. When you eat smaller meals, your stomach produces less hydrochloric acid, which means that it has to exert less energy., Since gastroparesis impairs the stomachâ€™s digestive function, it is important to consider foods that are easily digested.Some foods are more simple than others, so they are able to be broken down more quickly and efficiently. Easy-to-digest foods include:


White bread
Soup
Watermelon
Peaches
Pears
Fruit juices
Potatoes
Apples without skin
Mushrooms
Lettuce
Yogurt

, When you lie down right after eating, your stomach has a harder time digesting the food that you have just put into it. When possible, try to eat at least two or three hours before getting into bed for the night or taking a nap.
 After you eat, go for a walk. Exercise helps to boost metabolism, which aids your stomach in digesting food. Gently walking can help your stomach process your meal more quickly than if you just sit quietly after a meal.

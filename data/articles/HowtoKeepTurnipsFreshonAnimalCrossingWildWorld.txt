 Joan comes on Sundays from 6 am to 12 pm through your town gate to sell them. She only has one packet a week of red turnips, but you can buy as many white turnips as you want. There are two types of turnips


Red turnips. Price: 1,000 Bells each
White turnips. Price: usually 70-150 each.;
, After you have bought your turnips, you can plant them. It would be a good idea to plant them near your home, so you can easily water them everyday. Maybe you can clear an area near your house and use it just for turnips.


Red turnips. You have to water red turnips EVERY day. If you miss even one day, they will wither and die. You would have lost 1,000 Bells in the process, too.
White turnips. You don't have to plant them, just keep them in your inventory and check Tom Nook's store often. He sets 2 prices every day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, so it is a good idea to check twice. Try to sell your turnips for more than what you pain to make a profit. If you do not sell them in a week, they will rot and you might as well throw them away or recycle.
 Buy a table and put it in your house. Place your white turnips on the table and wait until Nook has a good buying price for turnips (i.e. over 100 Bells). This will NOT work with red turnips.

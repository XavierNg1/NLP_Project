 There should be a trademark made of paper on the side of the shoe. There should be another, printed on the plastic on the back of the shoe. There should be one last trademark on the insole.
 The logos should all be spelled correctly. Compare the font on the logos to the font on other Vans shoes that you know are real.


The color the trademark is printed in can vary, but the font should always be the same. The “V” should have a long line extending out of its right edge. The “ans" should be under the line., On many fake Vans' shoes, the logo on the insole will be faded. The real one will be well colored in, bright, and easy to read.

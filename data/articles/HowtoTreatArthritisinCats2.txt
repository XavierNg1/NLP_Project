 Nutraceuticals are food supplements that have a drug-like action. Nutraceuticals are usually side-effect free and safer than pharmaceuticals. Another advantage is that they are available without prescription.


Two nutraceuticals relevant to joint health are chondroitin and glucosamine. These two molecules are "synergistic", which means they have a greater effect when given together, than either does by itself.
 The theory behind glucosamine and chondroitin is that they provide the building blocks for cartilage repair and also improve the quality of joint fluid.


The aim is to nourish cartilage and optimize its health to protect against further chips and damage. They also work to increase the viscosity (or thickness) of joint fluid which makes for better lubrication.
There is a great deal of debate among veterinary scientists as to whether chondroitin and glucosamine can live up to these claims. However, a lot of animals do seem to benefit, and since the supplement is unlikely to do any harm (and if cost is not a factor) there is nothing to be lost by using this supplement.
 Chondroitin and glucosamine are marketed in palatable veterinary formulations, though human supplements are also suitable for use in the cat.


A typical dose is 500mg of glucosamine and 400mg of chondroitin, daily. For arthritic animals, the nutraceuticals must be taken for life.

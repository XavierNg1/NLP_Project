 Position the cap so that it is centered directly over the inner pipe of the chimney. Push down on the cap, using your body weight to apply extra force, until the cap slides into the pipe.Continue pushing until the solid part of the pipe is completely hidden inside the chimney. The netted or cage-like portion should be elevated above the chimney top.
Technically, the installation can stop here. Round chimney caps are primarily held in place by friction and pressure.;
, If your chimney is made of metal, you should not apply caulk. On the other hand, if the pipe is made from another material, like clay tile, you should seal the joint with weather-proof silicone caulk.


Apply a thin, even strip of caulk around the entire perimeter of the cap, filling in the seam.
The caulk helps to secure the cap and further prevents moisture from getting inside.
 While not always necessary, some prefer to secure a chimney cap to a metal pipe using pressure screws. Do not use pressure screws when working with materials other than metal, though.


The manufacturer's instructions that come with your cap will usually specify whether or not you should use pressure screws.
Use pressure screws that are 1/4 inch (0.64 cm) in diameter and 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 inches (3.8 to 4.4 cm) long.
Twist these screws into the holes along the side of the cap until they stop turning.

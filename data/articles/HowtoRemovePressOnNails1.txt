 Soaking your press-on nails in a bowl of warm soapy water may help to loosen them. Mix some warm water and add a few drops of hand soap in a small dish. Place your fingertips in the water and let your nails soak for about 10 minutes.


You can try to rock the nails back and forth slightly while they are soaking then the soapy water. This might help to get some water to the adhesive and loosen it.
After about 10 minutes of soaking your fingertips, remove them from the water and see if you can peel off the nails.;
, Cuticle oil may also help to loosen up press-on nails.Apply a few drops of cuticle oil to the areas just under the press-on nails. Then, let the oil soak in for a few minutes.


After a few minutes, try to rock the nails back and forth to see if they are loose enough to pull off.
Don’t try to force off the nail if it will not come off easily.
 You can also use a cuticle pusher to get underneath the nail and slowly work it off. Use the pointed end of a wooden cuticle pusher to get between your natural nail and the fake nail. Then, slowly start rolling the cuticle pusher back and forth to loosen the nail.








Roll the cuticle pusher down from the cuticle towards the tip of your nail. Don’t start from the tip and work backwards.
 After you have taken off all of the nails, go back over your nails and peel off any remaining adhesive. You can also use the cuticle pusher to help you scrape this adhesive off of your nails.








If the adhesive does not seem to budge, then you can try soaking your nails in warm water or applying a bit of nail polish remover with a cotton ball.

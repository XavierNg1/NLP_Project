 Another option is to showcase your “baby hair,” a popular look in the 90s.Hold your hair up loosely with one hand as you craft one of these looks with your other hand. Then finish the rest of your hair with a ponytail or updo.For the loose strands look, pull a couple of locks from the front to hang down by your cheeks.
For the “baby hair” look, use a toothbrush and some styling powder to pull down the fine hair around your hairline., Put your hair in a high or side ponytail with a single fabric scrunchie. Alternately, go for the three scrunchies look! Pull half of your hair up in a scrunchie. Add a second scrunchie halfway down your half ponytail. Then secure all of the hair hanging down with a third scrunchie in a low ponytail.


You may want to wear hair elastics underneath the scrunchies, since fabric scrunchies have a tendency to slide down.
 Wear a jeweled comb headband…especially 90s if you wear it with spiral curls! Or, try pulling up small sections of your hair and securing them with mini butterfly clips.

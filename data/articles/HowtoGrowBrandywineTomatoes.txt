Place potting soil in shallow containers.
Set the Brandywine seeds into the containers, about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) deep.
Fill a pan with water and place the containers in the pan until the soil has soaked up all the water.
Place the containers in a warm location, ideally about 75 degrees F (24 degrees C).
Move your containers to a warm, well-lit location as soon as the seedlings pop up (about 5 or 6 days). Keep them there until the last frost, when you are ready to plant.;

Check your soil. Brandywines prefer a soil with a pH of about 6.5, with less nitrogen. Too much nitrogen will encourage more foliage on the tomatoes and less fruit. Make sure the soil is well draining and supplemented with organic material.
Choose a location with lots of space and full sun. Because of their heavy foliage, Brandywine tomatoes need extra space to grow.
 This is to allow the small plants to acclimate to the weather, and it is often called "hardening."

, Dig a hole large enough to accommodate the root ball of each small plant using a trowel. Place the plants in the holes and cover with the dirt. Space the tomato plants 18 inches (46 cm) apart.



Press a wooden or metal stake into the ground at the base of each tomato plant.
Tie the main stem of the plant securely to the stake.
 Pull off any suckers that attach from the leaf stem to the main stem. Thin out any heavy areas of foliage to allow the plant to receive more nutrients.
 Make sure you water only the base soil, not the leaves of a plant. A garden drip system is best for tomatoes, as it will provide steady moisture to the soil, but not wet the entire plant.

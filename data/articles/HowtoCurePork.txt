 The meat should be fresh and chilled.;
,,


Mix together 2 oz. (56.69 g) of salt, 2 tsp. (9.5 g) of pink curing salt, 4 tbsp. (56.7 g) of black pepper, 4 crumbled bay leaves, 1 tsp. (4.8 g) of nutmeg, ï¿½ cup (56.7 g) of brown sugar, 5 smashed cloves of garlic, 2 tbsp. (28.3 g) of crushed juniper berries, and 10 sprigs of thyme.



Place the meat onto a clean, dry surface.
Pour half of the dry mixture onto the meat. Turn it over and pour on the rest of the rub.
Flip the meat over and make sure the entire surface is covered with the rub.



Place the meat into an airtight plastic bag and into the refrigerator where it will not be disturbed.
Remove the bag and rub the pork after 3 days. Juices will have leaked into the bag as the salt dries out the meat.
Replace the meat in the refrigerator for another 4 days.



Choose an area with good air circulation and a temperature below 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.55 degrees Celsius). The room must be clean and dry. It should have an apparatus or fixture for hanging objects. Rafters and ceiling basket hooks both work.



Take 2 lengths of butchers twine and wrap them around each side of the belly 2 to 3 times.
Knot the twine close to the meat.

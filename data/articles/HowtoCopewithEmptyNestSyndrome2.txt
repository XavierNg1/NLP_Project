 You are not just a parent, and you are not defined by that role. You wear many hats every day. You should figure out what other roles you are outside of a parent. Make a list and figure out which roles are important to you and what you can work on.For example, you may be a wife or husband, sibling, daughter or son, friend, owner of a business, career professional, pet owner - the list can go on and on.
Figure out which of these roles you’d like to expand. Put more time into relationships, focus on your career, volunteer, or become active in your community.
This time of your life can be exciting. Do something for yourself, such as taking a vacation or starting a new hobby.
 You may be tempted to make major changes to compensate for the empty nest you now have at home. You should refrain from making these types of changes for awhile after your child leaves home. This helps you not make any rash decisions before you can think about it or cope. A good time to wait is between one and two years to adjust to your new life.For example, avoid selling your house, moving, or changing careers.
 It is okay to be upset and grieve for your loss. There is nothing wrong with being upset when your children leave. Allowing yourself to express your feelings can help you process and move on past it.Talk to others about your feelings. Talking through what you are feeling can help you accept and move on from your feelings.
 You should give yourself time to adjust to your new life. Your child leaving home is a big change and adjustment for you. You may have to relearn how to focus on yourself, figure out what to do with your day, and learn how to fill the silence. Give yourself a few weeks or months to adjust to your new living situation.Don’t be too hard on yourself. You shouldn’t expect yourself just to suddenly be fine or bounce back immediately. It’s okay to need time to process and adjust.
 Sometimes, something as simple as writing in a journal can help you grieve, process, accept new changes, and move on. Your journal is a safe, private place where you can be honest, angry, sad, or any other feeling you want.Consider writing in your journal every day to get out those day’s feelings. Don’t be embarrassed or worried about writing what you feel. No one has to see it, and all of your feelings - even negative ones - are valid.
 As you work through the months after your children leave home, you should make sure to take care of yourself. This means getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and exercising regularly. You may feel too upset to keep up with your routines, but try to keep active and putting yourself first.If there are days you can’t really get motivated, that’s okay. You can allow yourself a few days to be lethargic. However, you should aim to eat balanced, healthy meals every day, keep up with sleep routines, and exercise three to five times each week.
 When your child leaves home, you should accept that they are now independent and about to embark on their own experiences. Let your child know you are proud of them, let them make their own decisions, and support them when you can.


Try not to compare your child’s experiences or timing with your own, or being upset if they left earlier than other children or you left home. Avoid making your child feel guilty for leaving or not visiting as often.
You should try to help your child in any way that you can to succeed.

 Keep your head up so you know where your opponent is and you don't let the runner juke you. Keeping your head up also 'locks' your helmet into your shoulder pads and help to prevent neck injuries. Breaking down is a lot like coiling and striking similar to the way a rattlesnake strikes.;
, If you don't break down first, you won't be able to get a nice low tackle. If you don't wrap up, unless you are considerably larger than the person you are trying to tackle, they will get away from you - it's their job. A one arm grab isn't a tackle and most likely will just spin you around and make you look silly.
 Try to pick them up if you can (using your legs like you do when you squat at the gym), a back can't run if their feet aren't on the ground. If you can't lift them up then continue to drive as hard as you can until help arrives.

 It will be surrounded by sizing handle dots.
 You'll choose "Flip Horizontal" to flip the graphic side-over-side (around its vertical axis) or "Flip Vertical" to flip the graphic top to bottom (around its horizontal axis). Where these commands are located depends on your version of Publisher.


In Microsoft Publisher 2003 and 2007, select "Rotate and Flip" from the "Arrange" menu. Select "Flip Horizontal" or "Flip Vertical" from the "Rotate and Flip" submenu.
In Microsoft Publisher 2010, select "Flip Horizontal" or "Flip Vertical" from the "Rotate" dropdown in the "Arrange" group on the "Home" menu ribbon.
When flipping a graphic, consider any details that may be reversed when you flip it. Items such as reversed text or even the way clothing wraps around a man's or woman's body can make a flipped graphic look "wrong."

 If someone is lying to you, there’s a good chance that electronic proof exists. People often log their locations and activities on social media. Texting and instant messaging also make up a large portion of person to person communication. If you can gain access to someone’s phone or social media account, you will likely know who they are talking to and what they have been doing., If you believe someone is lying about where they are going, you can find out with a simple stakeout. Go to the place that they claim to be and keep yourself out of sight. Watch closely to see what time they arrive, what time they leave, or if they were even there at all. If their story checks out, they were telling the truth. If not, you have proof that they were lying to you., If you suspect someone is lying to you, you can always ask other people they know. You can ask bluntly if you are comfortable doing that. If not, you can try to get the information you need through casual conversation.

For example, if you were going to ask bluntly you might say something like, “Were they really with you last night?”
If you were going to try to be casual, you could ask something like, “Did you two have a good time last night?”

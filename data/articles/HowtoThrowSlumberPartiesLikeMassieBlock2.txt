 Smile, and tell them to have a good night. Look them in the eye when you talk.
 Make sure there is no drama and that everyone is happy. Make sure nobody is ever bored and that you're all participating in every activity (have a list handy in case of mind-blanking).
 you should go to bed at this time so you can wake up early and be happy-cheery. Plan a vibrating phone alarm in your pocket (or nearby in your sleeping bag if there is no pockets) so you can get up first to put breakfast on plates and make sure you are presentable. If someone does not want to sleep at this time or can't sleep, let them watch TV or listen to music. Make sure they don't disturb the early sleepers.
 You should be up first, by at least 30 minutes. Wake at 8:00A.M and do your makeup. Get dressed, then head to the kitchen. Make breakfast or get it ready and put it on a serving tray. If you are allowed to eat outside of the kitchen, take it the sleepover- room. If not, set out the appropriate silverware and plates for the meal and put it all on the breakfast table. Go wake up everyone else if they aren't already awake. Make sure you're in a different outfit than yesterday and that you didn't reuse ANY part of it. Shoes + Designer bag included.
 Make sure that you're not just sitting around waiting for them to leave! Either be on Facebook as a group, gossiping, on a Wii, or something else. Most importantly, you should be doing something fun and easy. Don't have many crafts in the morning, as they will be tiresome and messy.
 You should have party favors of some sort, whether it be store bought, like lipgloss, or not, like a craft you made. As the parent/guardian/driver comes to pick everyone up, walk your guests to the car and wave/hug goodbye to each.

 One way to lift your friend’s spirits after a breakup is by complimenting them. Do this by telling your friend three things you love about them. Send it in a text message, write it down and photograph it, or make a video and attach it to the message.For instance, you might text, “You are an awesome friend. I love that you have a great sense of humor, you’re always there when I need you, and you make a mean ice cream sundae, too. Hope you feel better (-: ”

, Going through a breakup can be devastating. Many people often react by living in sweats, eating lots of junk food, and hiding out in their rooms. Help your friend get out of the post-breakup funk by challenging them to get dressed up.


You might say, “No more sweats! I need you to look in your closet and put on your favorite outfit. Do your makeup and style your hair. Then, send me a pic of the transformation.”
Even better, tell your friend to get dressed so the two of you can go out for lunch or see a movie together. Getting out of the house might make them feel better, too.
 GIFs are like animated memes. They are a perfect way to express your feelings through text. If your close friend, sibling, or other family member is down on themselves after a breakup, look through a GIF library and find the right animation to cheer them up. Find a GIF from a favorite movie or TV show relating to a breakup. It’s a great way to make them smile.


A great library for GIFs is GIPHY. You can find the application in your phone’s app store, download it, and then attach the GIFs directly to text messages., Different online websites offer cards that you can send through text message. Browse the website and find a funny ecard about breakups. Someecards.com, for example, lets you search for ecards about breakups.


For example, one funny card says, “It’s better to have loved and lost than to live with a psycho for the rest of your life.” Such a card is sure to remind your friend that they are probably better off without their ex.

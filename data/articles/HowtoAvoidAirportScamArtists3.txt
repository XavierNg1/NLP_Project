 If you are being picked up at the airport, always check the ID and credentials of the person picking you up. Even if they are holding a sign with your name, it is good to double-check. Some scam artists will copy the signs of legitimate services and pick up their clients, only to take them to expensive hotels, where they force them to pay higher rates.You should ask, “Are you from the pick-up service? Do you mind if I check your ID?”

, Taxi drivers can sometimes work a number of scams. They might try to take you on a longer “scenic” route. They may try to convince you that their meter is broken, charging you an extremely high rate once you reach your destination. To reduce your chances of these scams, you should only take licensed taxis with working meters from the airport.Wait in the official taxi line, even if there are other taxis without a line. The taxi driver should have their license displayed on their window or by the driver’s seat.


You can ask, “Do you mind if I see your taxi certification?” In most places, they are required to show you it.
If you can’t find a cab with a working meter, agree on a price before you or your luggage goes into the cab., If you are going to a hotel from the airport, tell the taxi driver exactly where you want to go. If they try to tell you that the hotel is closed or overbooked, insist to be taken there anyways. The taxi driver may be trying to convince you to go to a different hotel where they receive a commission. These hotels often are scams in their own right.If they say, “That hotel is closed. Let me take you to another one,” you should say, “No. I want to see for myself. Take me to my hotel.”
If you are worried, you can call the hotel on your way. Use the number on your confirmation receipt; do not let the driver call on your behalf. Ask, “My driver says you are closed. Is that true?”

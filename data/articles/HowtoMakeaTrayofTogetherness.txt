 The container should be shaped as a circle or an octagon. A flower variation of the octagon is acceptable. Any containers with slightly raised sides that can be divided into eight equal portions is ideal, such as a large shallow bowl or a round tray or platter. Platters that are already divided in this manner can be purchased from Asian gift or grocery stores and are usually made from ceramic, rosewood, glass or plastic.


If giving as a gift, the best container is one with a lid so that the goodies don't tip out. This container must have separate compartments inside, preferably eight because this represents the Eight Immortals. A good place to look for such a container is in an Asian grocery store.
A container with a lid is also useful for keeping the treats fresh overnight and for keeping away insects.;
, For example:


Lychee nuts: for close family relationships
Red melon seeds: for happiness, truth and joy
Peanuts: for a long and happy life
Candied melon: for growth and health
Coconut, fresh or dried: for unity and friendship
Lotus seeds: for fertility
Longan: for many good sons
Kumquat: for prosperity
Other suitable sweets with appropriate meanings that bode well for the future.
 Then close the lid.
 If preparing for your own home, place the tray of togetherness out for guests to enjoy at will.


Keep refilling the tray during the period of Chinese New Year celebrations.

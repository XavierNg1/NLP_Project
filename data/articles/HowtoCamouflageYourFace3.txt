 You could buy a camo pattern, a printed leaf and grass pattern, or a plain color like olive green. Choose the color based on your surroundings. For sufficient material to make a bandana, be sure the fabric is at least 2 feet (0.61 m) by 2ft. Consider using fabric that is 100% cotton or polyester for breathability. You can buy fabric at your local arts and crafts store or on Amazon for around $10., A standard bandana is 22 inches (55.9 cm) by 22 inches. If you want a larger one, you could make it 27 inches (68.6 cm) by 27 inches. To keep the bandana from unravelling, you can sew a hem around the outside. Simply fold the fabric in about an inch and stitch around the outer edge., You can add more camouflage or contrast to your bandana if you would like. Use spray paint in tan, green, and black and add splotches to your bandana. You could also use fabric paint or markers. Feel free to decorate it how you see fit. You could add some stripes to simulate grass or blotches to look like leaves. You can also fasten foliage to your bandana.
 Fold the fabric in half diagonally and wrap it around your face with the large part in the front and the narrow part in the back. The bandana should face down, forming a “V” shape towards your neck. Cover your nose and mouth but keep your eyes uncovered. Tie a double knot in the back of your head with the ends of the fabric. Secure it tightly so that it stays in place, but not too tight where it is uncomfortable.

 Watching people's faces while they talk is a good way to pick up on sarcasm. Often a sentence that may sound completely genuine can be intended sarcastically when accompanied by a specific facial expression.


Lifted eyebrows, rolling eyes and smirking mouths are some common tell-tale signs of sarcasm.Also look out for other facial expressions which indicate disgust, irritation or apathy., Although gestures such as head nods, body leans and thumbs-up signs may not be sarcastic in themselves, when combined with other verbal and non-verbal cues they are highly likely to indicate sarcasm.

 One way to honor your loved one is to set up a photo station at your wedding reception. You could do a collection of photos, along with a short description of who the person is or a quote that reminds you of them.For instance, you could write, "In loving memory of Kasey's mother, who we know is with us in spirit today."

, Another way to include your loved one is to use something they gave you in your reception. For instance, maybe your grandmother gave you a cake serving set that you love. Consider using that to serve at your wedding., Generally, the best man and maid of honor give a toast at the wedding, but that doesn't mean you can't give one to honor the person you've lost. You can take a moment to remember them as a way of including them in your special day.Consider including a personal anecdote about the person to really keep their spirit alive.
For instance, you could say, "At this time, I'd like to give a toast for my mother, who passed away two years ago. She would have loved to have been here today. She was always up for a celebration, and she would have been overjoyed to see me marry the love of my life. She was a kind and gentle woman, and all she ever wanted was to see her children happy. However, I know she is here in spirit. Please raise your glasses in memory of my mother, Rebekah Jones."

, Traditionally, the couple gives out a small favor near the end of the wedding for the guests to take home. Instead of doing that, you can make a donation in your loved one's name to a charity they would have liked and hand out small cards explaining the favor.The cards could read, "Instead of providing a wedding favor, we have made a donation to in memory of the bride's mother, Rebekah Jones. Mrs. Jones passed away in 2010."

 You can only move and reposition the taskbar if it is set to the "unlock" position.


Right-click in a blank spot of the taskbar to display the taskbar dialog box.
Click on the checkmark next to "Lock the taskbar" to unlock the taskbar. If the taskbar is already unlocked, there will be no checkmark icon present.



Click directly on the taskbar, then drag it to the section of the desktop you want it to reside. The taskbar can be moved to the left, right, top, or bottom of your desktop.
Release your mouse after you have placed the taskbar in its desired position.
 This procedure will prevent the taskbar from accidentally being repositioned or moved after you have placed it in its desired location.


Point to an empty space in the taskbar, then right-click your mouse to pull up the taskbar dialog box.
Click directly on "Lock the taskbar." A checkmark will now display next to this option to indicate that the taskbar is now locked.

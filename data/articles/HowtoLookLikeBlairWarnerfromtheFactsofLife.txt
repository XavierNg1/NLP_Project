 Warner's hair in real life is naturally dark. Get your hair to be a shoulder-length or longer, but no more than 8 inches (20.3Â cm) long.


Wash your hair with a good shampoo that will give you that lush shine and bounciness. You can try using Pantene Pro V or Herbal Essence produces. You can also just choose products that is best for your hair type.
Use a volume spray and spray it on your wet hair. Don't use spritz though, you want a bouncy look, not a stiff one.
Take a round brush and a blow dryer. Take the brush, roll, and blow each section as you go. Continue this until you get everything rolled. The round brush should help curl out the ends. When you're done, use lots of oil sheen and spray your hair. Aqua Net is the best hair spray to do this with.;
, Warner always wears one and it helps to avoid dryness or breakage in your hair. You can get bonnets at beauty supply stores or at local drug stores.
 Get Proactive Skin Solution to achieve a blemish free face. Depending on your skin type and how oily your skin is will depend on the kind of product to use; no one's skin is the same. Get tans on a regular basis or use a self tanner. Be careful when using tanners and try to avoid those orange and streaky looks. You'll also want to achieve a natural looking tan, something that doesn't look like you have tried to get.

For olive tanned skin: peach, coral, light brown, berry wine color, terracota, or mauves.

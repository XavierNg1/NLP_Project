 You can use your usual dish washing detergent to clean a nonstick wok. Place your wok in the water and let it soak if there's a lot of food debris on the wok.The sooner you wash your wok, the easier it will be to clean. Avoid letting your wok sit for long periods of time with food remnants crusted on it.
 Use a soft sponge, scrubber, or wok brush to gently clean any food debris. Avoid using abrasive sponges, like steel wool pads, since these can destroy the nonstick coating.If you don't get the pan completely clean, a layer of oil may bake on the wok making the wok become sticky over time. To remove the sticky layer, simply scrub the wok well.
 Rinse the wok with cold water and check to make sure that you completely removed all traces of food debris. If not, wash the wok and rinse it again.


If there's a stubborn bit of food sticking to the wok, soak it in the hot soapy water for a few minutes before scrubbing it again.
 Wipe the wok dry with a soft cloth and store it until you're ready to use it again. If you can, hang the wok. If you need to stack other pans inside your wok, take care that they don't scratch the nonstick surface.Unlike uncoated woks, you don't need to season or dry your wok over the stove after cleaning it. The nonstick coating will protect the metal of the wok.

 If they're trying to get to sleep, they'll be really annoyed that you're not letting them sleep. If they're already asleep, they'll be annoyed that you woke them up for no reason.


When your sibling is sleeping, put your face right on top of theirs, stare at them, breathe hard, cough on them, or sneeze on them.






If your sibling is sleeping, go get some make-up and paint a clown face on your face(if you don't have makeup, use non toxic markers!). Then, get a flashlight, and wake him up. As he opens his eyes, shine the flashlight on your face. He'll see the clown face and get really scared.






If your sibling is trying to get to sleep, keep asking him or her a ridiculous question like "Where do frogs come from?" over and over again. Keep asking the same question until your sibling wants to scream.

, Call your sibling nice things, then ask them to read in their room because it's a nice spot. You can also read over their shoulder. This is very annoying, especially when they're reading a book they don't want you to see. When they're gone, move some of their stuff and read one of their books. Make sure there are other people around that could have moved them, so there are more suspects. If they blame it on you, say something like "I didn't mean to" or " I looked at them, and forgot where they went."

, If they win, then say "I win! I win!" and keep on saying it. When you beat your sibling at your favorite game, shout "You lose!" repeatedly.


Whenever you're playing a game with your sibling, take the game very seriously when you are winning. Whenever your sibling is winning, act like you don't care. Don't make a big deal if your sibling loses interest when you're winning â€” they want you to get upset!







, Pretend to be in an invisible box, then if someone else comes in the room, act normal. If your sibling calls you names, do something random that fits what they said and point at them. Get in their face to creep them out.

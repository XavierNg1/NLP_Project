 Recent banknotes have very advanced security features that can include hologram strips or patches, Motion (TM) strips (strips of micro lenses which produces 'moving' images when tilted), and even a silver coating on the reverse.;
, Many banknotes, including older ones, have watermarks that can be seen when the note is exposed to bright light.
 Microprinting is a common anti-counterfeit technique that involves printing very very small text, usually too small to read with the naked eye. They can be hard to copy using regular printers.
 In some banknotes, Braille raised dots are available to guide the blind to identify certain banknotes. Be aware that not all raised dots are Braille, but most can help you determine the authenticity of a banknote.
 The serial number is usually printed twice on the note, but the two numbers can sometimes be different. Refer the central bank (or the bank which issues the banknotes) for more information.
 Polymer banknotes usually have a see-through, transparent (or partly translucent) window.
 Hybrid banknotes are made of both polymer and paper, or paper with polymer elements inserted into it. These are usually hard to straighten due to the manufacturing process, even with uncirculated banknotes. The paper-polymer interface is usually invisible.
 Genuine banknotes look almost perfect even when they are heavily used. Banknotes are engineered to last a long time, and some banknotes have a life expectancy of up to 10 years.
 Some genuine banknotes will glow in only certain parts.


This step is often the last step in ensuring that a banknote is genuine.

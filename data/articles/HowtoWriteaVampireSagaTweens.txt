, Make them bloodthirsty, cruel, violent, or romantic, sweet, only feeds when needed.
 Act as they would, eat as they would, speak as they would, be them. This will give you a good understanding of how others will act towards them. That way you could improve the novel.
 Like the graphic organizers people use. Then you are ready.
 Length doesn't matter as much as the content Edit any mistakes and make it perfect.
 I'd suggest friends so you could surprise your family when it is over. Let them criticize you. It is good for your story.
 Try a nice one such as McGraw Hill, or Harper Collins. You could even self publish it at Lulu.com. Send it in. If you do not have the faith, give it to a friend that has faith in the story.

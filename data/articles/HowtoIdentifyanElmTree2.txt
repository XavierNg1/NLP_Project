 Many animals, bugs, and birds share the ecosystem with elms. For instance, the American elm attracts birds and mammals (mice, squirrels, and opossums) that feed on its buds.Deer and rabbits will chew the bark and small branches of younger trees.If you see a host of animals and bugs hanging around a tree, it could be an elm.


Caterpillars might be found munching on the leaves.
Woodpeckers, raccoons, squirrels, and chickadees are commonly found living in elms.
Slippery elms also attract birds, who like to snack on the treeâ€™s fruit and buds., The base of an elm is reinforced with a visible, shallow root system with a broad reach.The bark of the roots will have the same general texture and color as the bark on the rest of the tree. While it might not be present in young elms, look for roots that are visible along the ground.
 Elm trees are commonly afflicted with Dutch elm disease. As its name implies, the disease only affects elm trees, so if you see a tree with the symptoms of Dutch elm disease, you can safely conclude it is an elm. Look for:Dead leaves that have not fallen off the tree
Yellowing or other discoloration in fall or spring
Wilting leaves and young shoots present at the same time

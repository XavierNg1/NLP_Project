  Choose an object that has meaning to you, and can be attached to a string, allowing for easy, smooth, swinging movement. 


You can also purchase a pendulum if you prefer, but be cautious about choosing one made up of stones.  It is better to choose one that is made of brass or other metals.  Stones have their own energy which might interfere with clear movement.  Sit at a table or have a flat surface on your lap. ;
, See yourself having a conversation with someone who has passed to spirit.  Someone you love would be ideal, for instance. 


Holding your pendulum still in front of you, ask your spirit messenger to indicate a "yes" for you and notice the movement of the pendulum. 
Gently tap the pendulum on the surface in front of you and say "thank you".  Do the same process again for "Yes" and "I don't know, or wouldn't want to say at this time".
 Once you are centered and know the movements of the pendulum, that will indicate "yes", "no" and "not at this time"

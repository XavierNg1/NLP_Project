 Find a local GED testing center and sign up for a time that is available to you.


The GED must be taken at a testing center in person. It is not available online.






Make sure that you give yourself enough time to adequately prepare for the test. You may want to schedule the test several months in advance.
In some cases you can pre-register online or download forms to print, fill out and mail in.






If you have special needs, be sure to indicate that on your registration form. Your needs will be accommodated by your testing center.
 Arrive promptly on testing day and use the techniques you practiced to take the complete test.


If you arranged to take the test on several different days, make sure you complete each portion of the test.
Follow the test administrator's instructions closely so you don't disqualify yourself from taking the test that day.
 Every testing center handles giving out scores differently. In some cases you may have to contact the testing center to receive your score, and in other cases it may be sent to you.
 If you didn't pass, you may take the test again after a specified waiting period. Check your state's requirements and ask your testing center when you may schedule a second test time.

 To open Link’s bag (your character’s item inventory), simply press the “Start” button on your game controller.
 Look for the sword on your item inventory list using the arrow buttons on your controller. When you find it, press the “Action” button on your controller where you want to assign it. Press the “Start” button once more to go back to the action phase of the game.
 One difference when using the sword on the 3D environment is the capability to aim. Press and hold the Aim button on your game controller to keep a steady focus at your target.
 Doing a slash attack on 3D environment is the same as how you would do it on 2D—while pressing the Aim button, just tap the Action button to make Link do a quick slash attack.
 Press and hold the Action button and wait for the wooden sword to light up. Once it does, release the Action button and Link will do a 360 degrees sweeping motion with the sword.
 This attack is only available in 3D versions of the game. While keeping your finger on the Aim button, tap the Jump button to make Link leap into the air towards your target. While in mid-air, quickly press the Action button to do a jump attack. Link will slash the target as he lands.
 Just like the jump attack, stab attacks are only for 3D versions. While keeping your focus on the target, press the Arrow buttons to move forward. While Link is moving towards the target, press the Action button and link will thrust the wooden sword into your enemy.

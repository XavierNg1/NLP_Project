 Yes, believe it or not, there is a medical supply website that has created an ultimate scented pad.


The goal of the Flatulence Deodorizer is to camouflage the bad smells that might come out of your body.You wear the deodorizer like you would a sanitary napkin, but it’s scented. The same company produces scented pillows.
 You could just douse the smell the old-fashioned away with perfume, cologne, deodorant, or room freshener – if you’re able.


Even if you’re in a school classroom, you might be able to subtly rub some perfume on your wrists. Buy a small roll-on perfume stick you can keep in your purse.
Too much perfume doesn’t smell very good, either, but it’s a lot better than people smelling your farts., Obviously, don’t light a match if this will get you in trouble at school. Playing with fire is serious business, and you shouldn’t do it.


However, if you’re able, lighting a match will cover up a fart smell. The reason is that the smell from a fart comes from hydrogen sulfur.When you light a match, you’re igniting phosphorus. This will ignite the sulfur in the air, and mask it.

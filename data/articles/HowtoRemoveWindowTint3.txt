 Leave for about an hour (whilst the paper is up, reapply the soapy water to the paper every 20 minutes or so to keep the moisture seeping through).
 Just simply reapply the soapy about half an hour if the top layer doesn't come off in long strips.
 It just comes off without any effort at all. It should come off as your spray it, without any scraping whatsoever from you.

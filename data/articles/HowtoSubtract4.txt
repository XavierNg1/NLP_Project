 Let's say you're working with the problem 13/10 - 3/5. Write down the problem so that both numerators, 13 and 3, and both denominators, 10 and 5, are directly across from each other. The two numbers will be separated by a subtraction sign. This will help you visualize the problem and reach a solution more easily.
 The lowest common denominator is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by both numbers. In this example, you'll need to find the lowest common denominator of the numbers 10 and 5. You can see that 10 is the lowest common denominator of both numbers, because 10 is evenly divisible by both 10 and 5.


Note that the lowest common denominator of two numbers isn't always one of the numbers. For example, the lowest common denominator of the numbers 3 and 2 is 6, because that's the smallest number that is evenly divisible by both numbers.
 The fraction 13/10 can be written the same way, since the denominator, 10, goes into the lowest common denominator, 10, exactly 1 time. However, the fraction 3/5 needs to be rewritten because the denominator, 5, goes into the lowest common denominator, 10, 2 times. So, the fraction 3/5 needs to be multiplied by 2/2 in order to have 10 in the denominator. therefore, 3/5 x 2/2 = 6/10. You've created an equivalent fraction. 3/5 is equal to 6/10, though 6/10 allows you to subtract the number from the first number, 13/10.


Write the new problem like this: 13/10 - 6/10.
 Simply subtract 13 - 6 to get 7. You should not change the denominators of the fractions.
 Your new numerator is 7. Both fractions have the denominator 10. Your final answer is therefore 7/10.
 If you want to make sure that you subtracted the fractions correctly, just add up your answer and the smaller fraction to make sure that your answer is the larger fraction. So, 7/10 + 6/10 = 13/10. You're all done.

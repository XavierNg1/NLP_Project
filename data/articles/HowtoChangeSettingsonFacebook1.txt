 It's a dark-blue app with a white "f" on it. If you're logged into Facebook, opening it will take you to your News Feed.


If you aren't logged into Facebook on your iPhone, enter your email address and password and tap Sign in to view the News Feed.;
, This icon is in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
 You'll see this option toward the bottom of the screen. Doing so will prompt a pop-up menu with the following settings options:



Account Settings - Most of the settings you will feasibly want to change live here. You can change anything from your name to your account's security settings.

Chat Settings - Slide this switch "On" or "Off" to toggle whether or not you show up as online while using the Facebook app.

Payments Settings - View your current balance and cards, add or remove payment methods, and see your payment history. You can also set up Touch ID and other security measures here.

News Feed Preferences - Change the kinds of posts you see in your News Feed, unfollow friends, and customize your prioritization settings.

Activity Log - View all of your activity, including likes, comments, and posts. You can delete or unlike items directly from within this menu.
 This will open the respective menu, allowing you to view--and, if needed, alter--the settings in your selected menu.


In some cases, you will need to tap a confirmation button of sorts (e.g., Save or OK) for your changes to take place.
You may need to close and restart Facebook for some changes (e.g., name or other profile changes) to display.

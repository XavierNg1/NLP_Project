 “Catch-22,” “Jurassic Park,” and “War and Peace,” for instance, should all be enclosed by quotation marks. Use quotation marks to indicate the titles of movies, too. “Star Wars,” “Hannibal,” “Superman,” and other films need quotation marks around them.


Other literary names and titles -- including poems, articles, chapter titles, and plays -- should likewise be surrounded by quotation marks. “Romeo and Juliet” and “Howl,” for instance, are the correct ways to refer to those works.
 Do not enclose band names in quotation marks. Treat these as you would proper names and use appropriate spelling and capitalization.
 Sculptures, however, should not be enclosed in quotation marks, though their titles are capitalized.

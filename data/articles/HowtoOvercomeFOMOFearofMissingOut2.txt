 One of the best ways to overcome FOMO is to begin to truly appreciate what you value in your life. Make a list of all the things that are important to you, including people, jobs, possessions or experiences. Spend some time reflecting on these things and expressing gratitude for them., After you make this list, develop a plan to do a better job of taking care of and appreciating the things that are important. Become a better parent, spouse, employee and friend. Work to find value in the things you have (like your job), even if they are not what you would like them to be.Reach out to your mom and tell her you love her.
Arrive to work on time and complete all assignments before they are due.
Give your car a good wash and wax.
 Spend some time each day engaging in the activities that you feel you are missing out on in some way. Even if you canâ€™t travel, you can still revisit old pictures of you on vacation, or pictures of you and your spouse when you first met.

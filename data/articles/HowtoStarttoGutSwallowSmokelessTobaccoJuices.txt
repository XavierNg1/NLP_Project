, Wait until the juices build up in your mouth with your saliva. Spit out the first couple of build ups. The first three or four should do.
Â Grab a bottle of water or a soft drink of your choice and take a sip, swallowing the built up juices with the drink. When taking the sip of water/soda, roll you lip over the dip to keep it in place.
 Let the juices build up, then wash them down with a sip of your drink until you are done with the dip. Then take it out.

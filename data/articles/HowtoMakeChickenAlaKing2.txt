 Place 1 cup (28 g) dried of porcini mushrooms in a medium-size bowl, and pour 1 cup (235 ml) of boiling water over them. Allow the mushrooms to soak in the water for about 20 minutes.Make sure that all of the mushrooms are covered by the water so they all soften.
 While the mushrooms soak, use a sharp knife to finely chop 5 sprigs of fresh Italian parsley and 1 bunch of fresh tarragon. You’ll need 1 tablespoon (15 g) of each when you’re finished chopping. Place the chopped herbs in a small bowl and set aside.The best way to chop herbs is to gather them up in a tight ball. Hold the ball with your non-knife hand, curling your fingers underneath to keep them safe, and balance the knife against the knuckles on your non-knife hand. Move the knife in a rocking motion to chop. You’ll need to go over the herbs several time to get a fine chop., Take 8 ounces (224 g) of cremini mushrooms that have been cleaned and trimmed, and chop them into ¼-inch (6 mm) thick pieces. Place them in a medium size bowl and set aside. Next, finely chop 2 medium shallots, and place them in a small bowl to set aside.You can substitute your favorite type of mushrooms for the cremini or use a mix of mushrooms if you prefer. For example, you might use shiitake or a mix of cremini and shiitake.
 After the 20 minutes are up, take the porcini mushrooms out of the water. Set the water aside for later use. Transfer the mushrooms to a cutting board, and chop coarsely. Place them in a small bowl and set aside.It’s best to remove the mushrooms from the water with a slotted spoon. That ensures that you won’t lose any of the mushroom liquid.
 Add 2 cups (470 ml) of low-sodium chicken stock or broth to a medium-size bowl. Take ½ cup of the mushroom soaking liquid, mix it into the chicken stock, and set aside.When you’re measuring the mushroom soaking liquid, make sure not to include any of the sediment that may be at the bottom of the bowl.

 However skilled a very young musician may be, they are not the ideal candidate to buy a cello for. Young children are known for going through very rapid growth spurts: as elementary school students, they'll grow about 2½ inches in just a single year.Part of what determines the cello you should buy is your size, and fractional size instruments are notoriously difficult to resale.


To avoid having to buy a brand new cello again within six months or a year, consider renting a cello instead for those who need anything up to a ¾ size.
 Are you brand new to playing the cello? Are you sure you plan to continue playing the instrument in the years to come? Will playing the cello be a hobby for you, or do you have plans to pursue it professionally, or even semi-professionally? If you aren't sure if you will continue to play the cello for many years and do not intend to take it at least semi-professionally, then you may be better off renting a cello until you're sure.
 Cellos are extremely expensive: for a good fractional, teachers advise students spend no less than $700; a good, full-sized cello for an adult will be at least $2000.Anything less expensive than that is not a good instrument and should be avoided. If you cannot afford to spend that much on buying a cello, renting is the better alternative.

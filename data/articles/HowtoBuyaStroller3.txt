 Before you even leave your home, have an idea of what you would like to spend on a stroller. Strollers can range from $20 to $1000, so have an idea of what features you would like to have, how durable a stroller is expected to be, and what you are comfortable spending. , Make sure it feels stable under your hands and maneuver through aisles and around corners. Add weight, such as a bag, to ensure that the performance will not significantly change as your child grows. , A good stroller should be able to be opened with one hand and a foot. This enables you to keep one hand free to hold the baby as needed. At the same time, check the latch on the stroller to make sure that it is sturdy - some strollers have collapsed when this latch comes undone.
 Steering is much easier with a full-length bar across the top than with two handles. If a single bar stroller is not an option, look for a stroller with very strong handles that are comfortable to hold. In both cases, adjustable handles are a good option if you are taller or shorter than average. , To ensure that brakes are easy to use and make for a smoother, controlled, and safer ride, practice braking with the stroller up and down aisles. If the front wheel is maneuverable, test the locking mechanism to see if it dramatically impacts your ability to steer the stroller., Nothing worse than a stroller that you cannot lift and fit into the back of the car! Ensure that you are comfortable with the stroller's weight and that it fits in your car or in your designated storage space.
 If you do not anticipate having more children, you may want to sell your baby products after your child has grown. In this case, you may choose to invest in higher-quality merchandise that will retain value. Check websites like Craigslist to see what used strollers are selling for.

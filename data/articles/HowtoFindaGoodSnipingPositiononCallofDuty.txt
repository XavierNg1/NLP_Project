, If you're behind a bunker, but you can not see through it however, then what's the point in it? So make sure your bunk has some sort of "foxhole" or where you can see over it.
 A covered corner is an ideal spot for sniping.
 This is a differentiation type problem. Some people like to be a ground sniper, while others prefer to stay inside building, while some off balconies, and some on top of vehicles. So if you're one who prefers to be in a higher position, make sure you go onto somewhere where there is a wall that you can keep safe behind, but be careful, sniper bullets can pierce coverage. Now, if you're more of a low level sniper then you'd want a spot that is covered where you could go prone, or a cornered position.
 The wider the better.

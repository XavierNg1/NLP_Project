 Printing things from the Internet and putting them in your carry on isn't that bad an idea. Since you are probably under 13, you sometimes get a little bag filled with goodies like a pack of cards, so that probably would also have little puzzles.;
, In your carry on, pack the essentials. iPods, Nintendo DS, a companion (yes, we all have one, whether it's a blanket, Mr. Snuggles or Suzy), wet wipes, a good book, gum, a light jumper, capris and items you printed off the Internet earlier. Put all of it in a small library bag or backpack.
 A clean shirt and clean pants will be good enough. Make it loose and long, plane seats rub the skin raw on your legs, and you can change in the bathroom on the plane to your capris if you get too hot.
 This is great for last minute snacks at the airport or a mad libs book.

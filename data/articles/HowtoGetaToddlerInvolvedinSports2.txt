 If you do want to start your toddler on a group sport, look for teams in your community that are aimed for toddlers and young children. This team may still offer unstructured play while teaching your toddler specific skills. These may be called “pee wee” or “munchkin” teams.


A good pee wee team will not be focused towards competing with other teams. Rather, it will start to instruct your child in a more toddler-friendly version of the sport.Check your local YMCA or recreation center to see if they offer toddler sports programs.
 In the summer time, you may be able to find a variety of sports programs tailored to toddlers. These will often be unstructured sports that encourage your child to run, race, and play with other kids. This type of play can help the child develop social and physical skills that help them become athletic when they are older.


These programs may be sport-specific, such as gymnastics, or they may be advertised as just a "sports" program, which will offer general athletic activity.
Schools, parks, community centers, and recreation centers often offer youth summer programs.
 You do not have to enroll your child in sports to foster a lifelong love of them. Invest in a child’s basketball hoop or a t-ball pole. Play the sport in the backyard with your child, encouraging them to run, throw, and catch.Some games you can play with your child include:


Tag
Hide and go seek
Race
Red Light, Green Light
Duck, Duck, Goose

, Your child can also be active playing alone. Buy toys that will encourage motor skills and physical activity.These are toys they can play with outside. Always supervise them when they play. Some good toys include:


A large bouncing ball
Bubbles
Inflatable pool
Small hula hoop
Small trampoline

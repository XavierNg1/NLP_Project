 The straight, flat-laced look is classic Vans, so donâ€™t let your laces get sloppy or it won't look right. If you want your vans to look crisp and new, keep the laces as straight as possible.









Every time you pull your laces through the eyelets, make sure to flatten them out and keep them from twisting up. Go slowly.
Don't over-tighten the laces, which can cause them to bunch up and look uneven, if they're actually pretty straight.
 It's a lot easier to lace up your sneakers when they're on the ground, with the toe facing you, instead of the other way around. If you want them to look right, take them off and turn them around.
 Vans white laces are usually the best laces for Vans, but any variety of white sneaker lace would be fine. In general, skate laces are pretty puffy and white, whereas some basketball laces can be really thin and cylindrical, or other sneaker laces can be kind of lighter.









You can use any color, of course, but new white laces are the most commonly associated with Vans.
 Having a fresh set of laces always looks cool. It's a good idea to change your laces every couple of weeks, especially if you're skating regularly and breaking laces, or scuffing them up.
 To get the most life out of your shoes, it's a good idea to alternate between the styles you use when you lace your shoes, so that they won't wear from repeated lacings.









If you bar-lace your shoes, cross-lace them every now and then to keep them looking new
If you cross-laces your Vans, change the direction of the crosses, so that the right side isn't always over the left, or vice versa. This will help to keep the shoes from wearing unevenly.

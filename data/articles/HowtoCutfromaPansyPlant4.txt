 Although most gardeners treat pansies as annuals (plants that only live for one year) these plants actually have a slightly longer lifespan than that. To get your pansies to behave more like perennials than annuals:


Plant them in a sunny spot. Although pansies prefer a cooler temperature, they like direct sunlight. Your plant is more likely to produce larger and more plentiful flowers if it gets the full sun it loves.






Consider the soil where you are planting your pansies.These plants aren’t especially particular about soil type but, like most plants, they prefer a well-draining, rich soil.
 An all-purpose water-soluble feed is a good choice for pansy fertilizer. You’ll also want to keep your plants well supplied with water during dry periods.


To know when to water your plants, check to see how dry the ground around them is. You should water your plants when the soil is dry to the touch.
 Like most flowering plants, removing dead flower heads and emerging seed heads can help to prolong the flowering period. ‘Deadhead’ withered flower heads by snipping the stem away just above the next leaf set. Remember to use a clean sharp blade to do this.


Remove seed pods as they develop. Seed production draws energy away from flower production so you’ll get more flowers if you remove the seed pods.
 Hot weather may cause your pansy to look lackluster. If you’re in a warm climate and expect a hot summer, move your pansy into a cooler location out of the sun, if you can, for the next few months.

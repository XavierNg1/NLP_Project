 In addition to setting a regular time that you will meet with your group, you can begin to structure your study sessions by imposing a time limit. Setting a time limit will help you stay on task. A good mark to shoot for is two hours, and any more than four hours is too long., The best way to make your study sessions productive is to determine what you’d like to get out of the experience. Determining the overarching goal of your group will keep everyone on the same page, and help you set smaller goals to meet during your session.Are you preparing for a particular exam, or trying to work through the basic concepts of a course?
Do you want to use this group to outline each chapter, or are you trying to complete a specific group project?

, Depending on the length of your session, you could begin by spending about half an hour reviewing what you learned that week. Rather than wondering where to begin, this provides a really good place to start, and helps to clarify what direction the session should go. Furthermore, this gives everybody a chance to ask questions and get some clarity on anything they didn’t understand., You can study more effectively if you know you will get to take a break, so it is a good idea to factor some breaks into your study session. After all, what is the fun of studying with friends if you never get to chat or gossip? Set a timer for 50 minutes and study without breaking your focus until the timer goes off. Then reset the timer for 10 minutes, during which members can talk, grab a snack, or use the restroom.
 It is a good idea to use the last 10 minutes to do a quick review of the session itself. If you plan to study together again, this can also be a good time to think about what you’d like to cover during the next session.

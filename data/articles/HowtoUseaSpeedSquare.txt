 Use the speed square to mark lines on wood at exactly 90 degrees to the wood's edge. Hold the tool against the end of the board. The lipped edge on the speed square will help line it up. Use the side of the square to mark the needed lines on the wood. Use the square to locate and mark studs, positioning floor joists, and laying out stair stringers.;
, When building cabinets, boxes, or other furniture pieces, hold the speed square against the wood to measure angles before cutting or attaching pieces of wood.
 Put the square firmly against the board and mark the location of the diagonal edge to create a 45 degree line. As an isosceles triangle, the square's diagonal edge is exactly at 45 degrees angle.
 Look for the pivot point at the corner of the speed square. Each line along the diagonal edge represents 1 degree, and they go from 0 to 90. Hold the pivot point against the board, and adjust the square until the degree gradation needed is aligned with the edge of the board. Use a pencil to draw a line along the square.
 Press the square against the edge of the wood and place a pencil tip into the notch that measures the number of inches needed. Slide the square along the wood with the pencil in the notch. This will produce a straight line that runs parallel to the edge of the wood.
 Position the square flatly on the board to be cut. Slide the saw shoe against the square, and cut. The saw will cut steadily and accurately because the speed square is thicker than a framing square or combination square.

 If you don’t know anyone who is currently using or who has used a water mattress, you can find reviews online. In some cases, water bed owners will even include videos of themselves getting into and out of the bed, and discussing their comfort levels. If you’d like to ask questions, you can try reaching out water bed owners via online question and answer forums like Yahoo! Answers or through the comments sections of various online water bed retailers.
 It’s important to tryout any mattress prior to investing in it. However, this becomes even more important when choosing a new water bed, especially if you’ve never had one before. Look for furniture stores that carry water beds or water bed specific suppliers in your area.


Search online for furniture retailers. If water beds aren’t listed, call to ask if they carry them.
Search online for mattress retail locations in your area, and call to see if they carry water beds.
If your local furniture or mattress retailers do not offer water beds, they may be able to direct you to a location where you can test out or purchase a water bed.
You may want to consider ordering a water bed online, but make sure they allow in home trials and returns as you won’t be able to test the mattress in advance.
 Once you find a location where water beds are sold, you’ll want to go to the water bed store to try out the available types of water beds. Call ahead to make sure the retailer has water beds available for you to try. Even though they sell water beds, the store may not have any on display. However, some locations are willing to set up water beds for you to try.


There are some online and in store retailers who will allow you to test water beds in your home and return them if you are unhappy.
Even if you are able to test a water bed mattress in a store, ask about return policies and at home trials. A mattress that seems comfortable for a few moments in a store may not seem as comfortable after several nights of sleep.

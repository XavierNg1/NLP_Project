 Airless sprayers don't use compressors. A pump forces the paint through a high-pressure hose and out the nozzle. Although they produce less overspray than a compressed air sprayer, an airless sprayer will produce paint mist that can travel on air currents to areas you don't want to paint.;

Use a nail to punch a hole in the rim of the paint can. Paint tends to collect on the rim of the can after it's been poured. When the lid is closed, paint seeps outside the can. Creating the hole in the rim allows the paint drip back into the can.
Place the lid back on the paint can, drape a cloth over the can and tap the lid down with a hammer. This keeps excess paint from splattering as you tightly close the lid.
 Accidents will happen, but their effects can be ameliorated if you act quickly.

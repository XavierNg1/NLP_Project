 Corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory medicines are the most common medications for LCM. They do not kill the LCM virus, but they sometimes help with symptoms and some of the more serious consequences, such as encephalitis.


Common corticosteroids include prednisone and methylprednisolone.Ribavirin has been studied as a treatment for LCM, but the results are mixed, and there are side effects.
Always use medications as directed.
 If your LCM has developed into hydrocephalus, you’ll need to get a shunt. A shunt or shunt system is a surgical device that diverts cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain or spine to another part of the body, usually the abdomen, but sometimes the lung or heart.Shunts may need to be replaced if they fail or become obstructed.
Potential side-effects of shunts include infection, over draining (removing too much CSF from the brain or spine), and under draining (not removing enough CSF from the brain or spine). You’ll likely need to make frequent follow-up trips to the doctor to ensure your shunt system is operating properly.
 Anyone can catch LCM. Pregnant women are at special risk because the infection can spread to the fetus and cause severe problems. Everyone should take special care to keep mice and other rodents away. Use mousetraps and block up potential points of entry into your house by mice and rats. For instance, plaster over any cracks in the walls where rodents may have access.


"Keep food in sealed containers. Clean areas contaminated with mouse saliva, urine or droppings carefully, using a face mask or covering, gloves, and disinfectant.
Laboratory workers who handle or are surrounded by mice and rodents in their work are also at higher risk for LCM than the average individual.Maintain excellent hygiene and follow laboratory protocols to ensure you do not contract the disease. Re-test rodents periodically to ensure that they do not have LCM.

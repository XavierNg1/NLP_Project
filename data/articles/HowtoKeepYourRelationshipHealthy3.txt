 Do not assume you and your partner have the same idea of what trust means. It is good to establish what each of you would consider a violation of trust. Some, for example, would see physical cheating as a breach of trust but not emotional cheating, whereas others believe that emotional cheating is as bad as physical cheating., Set certain boundaries and parameters for your relationship. These can sexual, personal, social, or financial. Both partners should agree on these boundaries and respect them. By talking through such limits, you will avoid conflict, and if someone does cross the line, you will have established a basis for discussing it. By respecting your partner’s boundaries, you are signaling that you trust them completely to act on their own without betraying you.


Common boundaries include understanding each partner’s expectations and limits on intimacy, public displays of affection, and confidentiality.
 Even small “white” lies can create a rift in your relationship. Start a habit of being completely honest with your partner. Even if you don’t want to bother them with your problems, it is healthier in the long term to be upfront. Encourage them to be just as honest.
 Holding onto anger or conflict only worsens the problem. If they did something to you months ago, you should forgive them for it and move on. Don’t use what they said or did in the past against them.If you having trouble letting go of something that happened in the past, remind yourself of the good things they are doing now. Purposely focus on the nice and pleasant things they do instead of the things that annoy you.

 Iron the collar by flipping it up spraying with starch, and ironing the wrong side and then the right side. Finish by folding it desired position and ironing the crease.
 Iron the rest of the shirt, moving from the front panel on one side to the front panel on the opposite side. The neck of the shirt should always be at the narrow end of the board.









Don't forget to spray the shirt with starch as you go!

, There are often pleats at the top of the back of dress shirts. These can be tricky to iron if you've never done it before.









Begin by flattening out the pleat as much as possible, getting as close to the seam as you can. Iron all of this area flat.
Next, fold the pleat completely closed and touch just a bit of the end around the first inch or so from the seam, to reform the pleat.
 When you iron around the buttons at the front of the shirt, it can be tricky. Just use the narrow point of the iron to work in between the buttons and remember not to iron on top of the buttons themselves.









Ironing this area from the underside first can make it much easier.

 For five, you just add the thumb.

Now, here's the tricky part!!! 6 is thumb and pinkie, seven is thumb and ring finger, eight is thumb and middle finger, 9 is thumb and index finger. Letters are for each set of a finished count through each cycle. Here is the progression...

Finger Binary 1-31ASL Numerals 32-40A 41Finger Binary 42-73ASL Numerals 74-82B 83 Finger Binary 84-115ASL Numerals 116-124. The Progression goes on and on in the same pattern like this, you won't need a chart.
The counting happens only on the Earth hand unless there is a decimal, then the Heaven hand becomes the Earth hand and the Earth hand becomes the Heaven hand.The Heaven hand is the “hand of multiples” and the right hand is always the decimal hand.

, You will also need to practice and study your terminology. To learn about abacus terminology learn it for future reference so you have a basic idea of how to use an abacus and how it translates to your hands. Terminology is used to teach you the basic functions and equivalences between an abacus, and the best manipulative, your hands.,, This means challenge yourself without making your head hurt., Do any and all math in this system, you can count in it, and you are comfortable in it enough to rely on it.,,, This is not to say you can't use the system, this is to say that you should only use this trick to speed up your mathematical side of your brain that deals with logic by using it more and more. ,, This is so that you can read them if you forget them., If don't always get the correct answers, that means you have to practice, practice, practice, because practice makes perfect.

Remember, if you flip the symbols upside down, you get even more to work with.
Remember to make three stops across your body for each section you're counting in. Counting in reverse will give you 12 times the total of the end you're working with.If you pivot your hand in all six directions, you get 72 more directions to work with. 93,450,240,000 is the total possibility to count up to with just one hand. 186,900,480,000 is possible with two hands, so in that case, keep the multiple in your head.

To do that, keep it 65 based to succeed in all your math. Every time you pivot your hand, the factor goes up that much more to multiply by, just be aware of that. 161,482,014,720,000 is the absolute ceiling for mathematical problems to be worked out on two hands.


If you use your feet, then you get 322,964,029,440,000 as your ceiling for counting/math.

 Some people find that trying to crack their jaw helps ease pain from TMJ or other jaw issues. To do so, relax your jaw and let it drop so that your mouth is open slightly.;
, Position your palms flat against each side of your face. Your thumb and index finger should make a “U” shape around your ear when you do this.
 Press your palm against your jaw, moving it to one side and then the other. The goal is to wiggle your jaw back and forth until you can get it to crack or pop back into place.
 In addition to moving your jaw side-to-side, you can also try moving it forward, backward, up, and down. Everyone is different so you might have to experiment with what works for you to be able to crack your jaw.

Use a roll of duct tape or stuff towels, blankets or sheets under the door and in the cracks of the door to keep the smoke out.
Cover all the air vents and heat units to prevent the smoke from entering the room.



Provide the exact address of the fire.
Tell the emergency response operator how many people are inside the burning house and the exact location. This should include whether you are on the first or second floor and in the back, side or front of the house.



Wave something out the window to attract attention or shine a flashlight to alert help.
 Smoke and heat rise, so be sure everyone stays low.

 Wash the squid thoroughly and remove the spines and beaks. Cut each squid into 1" pieces, separating the heads from the tentacles.


Do not remove the ink sac, as this will add flavor.
To see how to prepare squid, see this guide. However, since these are very small squid, it's not necessary to cut them up so much.
Frozen squid can be used if fresh squid is not available.
 Use a 4 ½ qt. cooking pot with a lid and a heavy base.


Mix to combine all the ingredients and coat the squid thoroughly.
Cover the pot, but leave the lid ajar to let some of the steam escape.
 Stir occasionally to make sure it doesn’t burn.
 This particular recipe has no sauce to accompany it.
 In a large frying pan, preheat the oil over medium-high heat, then add the squid.


Move the squid around the frying pan, pushing on them gently to make sure all the ink sacs are broken.
The squid should be tender, so watch carefully to make sure the squid doesn’t overcook.
 This is usually eaten with steamed white rice.

 Place a large pot of water on the stove, add a pinch of salt, and wait a few minutes for the water to boil.
 Run the Brussels sprouts under cold running water, and peel off any yellow leaves.
 Cut them in half from the top to the stem, and make a 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) incision in the stem.
 They should just begin to go soft. Then, drain them.
 Add 2 tbsp. of butter, 1 tsp. of salt, and 1 minced clove of garlic to a pan. Wait 1-2 minutes for the ingredients to heat up and for the garlic to become fragrant.
 Gently stir the Brussels sprouts to mix them with the other ingredients. If the pan gets too dry, add another tablespoon of butter.

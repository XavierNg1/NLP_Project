 Many people use plastic sheeting to preserve their furniture. However, this method is often viewed as pointless or inconvenient due to noise, discomfort, and opacity of the plastic.


You may also consider spreading out an old towel or blanket where your dog likes to lay. You can wash the towel whenever you like, and you can put it away when guests come to visit.
If your dog tends to climb on one particular piece of furniture and lay in the same spot, you may be able to keep hair off that furniture by protecting the spot. Some pet stores sell furniture covers specifically made for dogs.
 Consider brushing your dog more frequently, giving it haircuts, and giving it baths. Use a grooming brush to comb away loose hair.


Brushing your dog about two days a week dramatically cuts down on the amount of fur tumbleweeds rolling through your living room.
Give your dog a haircut once a month. It may stop shedding so much fur if you take control of the process.
Give your dog a bath once or twice a month, or as frequently as you like. After the bath, let it stay outside for about an hour to dry off.
Consider putting a stocking or thin sock over the vacuum hose, and then vacuuming your dog. You may not be able to get him or her to stand still.
 If your dog won't stop climbing all over your bed or couch, try training your pet to sleep on the floor instead. Scold your dog when it climbs on the furniture, and make it clear that it's wrong. If you are firm and persistent, you can retrain your dog and keep hair off of your furniture altogether. Bear in mind that if your dog sheds a lot, you may still need to vacuum frequently to keep dog hair off of the floor.
 If you think your dog might be losing hair for a medical reason, consult a vet for help. Your vet may prescribe hair-loss medication, or may be able to identify some other treatable condition that is causing the hair-fall.

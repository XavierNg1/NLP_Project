 Aereo is a service that streams your local channels to your Android device. You can watch these channels live or you can set your favorite shows to record so that you can watch them later. Aereo only works for over-the-air local channels, not cable subscription channels.


Aereo costs about $8 per month, and is not available in all areas.
You can sign up from the Aereo website.
 once you've signed up for Aereo, you can download the app for your Android device. Open the Google Play Store and search for "Aereo". Select "Aereo (Beta)" from the search results and install it on your device.
 You will be asked to log in with your Aereo account information. once you are logged in, the guide for your channels will appear, displaying the programs that are currently broadcasting.
 Tap the program that you want to watch. After a few moments of buffering, your show will begin playing from the beginning. You can pause and rewind the show as much as you'd like.


Aereo only broadcasts the individual shows, not the entire channel. This means that if you want to keep watching the same channel, you will need to select the next show on the guide.

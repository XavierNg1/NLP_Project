 It is quite expensive to paint a whole car, and usually not worth it for an everyday driver. Most whole body paint jobs are the result of some kind of special customization or restore. With this in mind, you want to know a little bit about the car you intend to paint and make sure that you choose a color scheme that suits your car. often this means sticking with a vintage color ― something that might have been on the car when it was new. Other times, it means a color scheme that brings out the best features of the car, even if that color scheme was never an original from the manufacturer.An example of a paint job that isn’t likely to flow would be restoring a ‘69 Chevelle, having a supercharger sticking up out of the hood, and painting it pink with purple polka dots.
 The great thing about restoring or customizing a car is the opportunity to truly have whatever you want. The end result should be something you are proud of, so naturally it has to be something that you like. Envision exactly what you want your car to look like., Whether you know what you want or not, an open dialogue with the painter is never a bad idea. They can help steer you toward the paints that will give you the look your heart desires. A professional artist/painter can also help to expand on your ideas if you get stuck at any point.

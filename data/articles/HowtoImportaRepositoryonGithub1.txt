 To use the Importer, you'll first need the URL of your desired repository.
 This should be in the upper right-hand or left-hand corner of your screen; clicking it will prompt a drop-down menu., This will take you to the import menu., You'll need to do this in the field under the "Your old repository's clone URL" heading., These include the user account with which the repository is associated and a name for the repository., Public repositories are available to the entire GitHub community, whereas Private repositories are restricted to you and any collaborators with whom you choose to share., This should be in the lower right-hand corner of the Import menu.

You may have to enter the account credentials associated with your repository if it's being imported from an account with password-protected attributes.
In the event that you have multiple projects saved at the target URL, click your desired file name to import that repository.
 If you are importing numerous files, you can choose to include or exclude large files from within the repository. Click "Continue" to finalize this process.

Importing large files can cost extra, so review your payment plan if you're uncertain about the implications of importing large files.
 GitHub will send you an email at your registered address when the process is complete.

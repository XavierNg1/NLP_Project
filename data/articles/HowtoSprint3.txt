 In general, you will want to begin a sprint crouched behind the starting line with your fingers on the ground and your legs positioned one behind the other. There are three types of starting positions: bullet or bunch starts, medium starts, and elongated starts. The type of start you choose depends on how far apart you want your legs to be when you begin your sprint. The best way to determine which starting position works best for you is to try each one several times. Regardless of your leg position, your arms should be about shoulder-width apart.


In a bunch start, the toes of your back foot are almost even with the heel of your front foot. Your legs will be very close together, making you look bunched up - hence the name, "bunch start."
In a medium start, the knee of your back leg is even with the heel of your front foot, putting more space between your legs.
In an elongated start, your back leg is stretched back considerably further than the heel of your front foot.
 Before taking off, lift your hips slightly in preparation for a burst of movement.
 In competitive sprinting, reaction time is crucial to achieving the best sprint time. Aim to launch from your "set" position instantly. It helps to have a timer close by or a friend to shout out an audible starting command; this is why they use a starting gun in competitive sprinting.
 You want your upper body to gradually rise from its starting position as your legs create the speed. It helps to look at the ground and concentrate on pumping your legs as quickly as possible.
 Try to do this as gradually as possible, creating a fluid motion that helps you accelerate.
 Maintain this speed until you reach the finish line.

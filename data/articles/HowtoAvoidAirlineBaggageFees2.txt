 Airline credit cards often offer free checked bags as an incentive. If you fly frequently and donâ€™t mind signing up for a card, this can be an option for you.Typically, you have to use this card to purchase your tickets in order to have your baggage fees waived.

 Most of the time, first class tickets are automatically bundled with a free checked bag. These tickets can be much more expensive than those for economy seats, but if you just want to avoid the trouble of paying separate baggage fees, you can spring for first class.

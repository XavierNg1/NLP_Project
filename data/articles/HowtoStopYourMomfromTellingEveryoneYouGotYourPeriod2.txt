 Grab a journal, diary, or notebook and sit down with it for at least 15 minutes. Think about your mom telling other people you got your period, and write down your thoughts.


For example, if your mom told your sister, try writing, “When my mom told my sister I got my period it made me feel…”
You could also write, “I don’t want other people knowing my private business because…”

, Make a list of the things you want to tell your mom during your conversation. Look over the feelings you wrote down earlier and let them guide you. You can take this list with you when you sit down to talk to your mom.
 Knowing where and when you’re going to talk to your mom will help you prepare mentally. Having the conversation as soon as you can means you’ll be closer to solving the issue sooner. Waiting too long can cause anxiety and might result in your mom telling more people about your period.


Do you usually have some alone time with your mom after school, while cooking dinner, or when she is driving you home from soccer practice? These could be great times to talk with her.
If you don’t have regular one-on-one time with your mom, ask her if there is a good time the two of you can sit down and talk privately. Try saying, “Mom, there is a private issue I’d like to talk to you about. Can we schedule some alone time to discuss it?”

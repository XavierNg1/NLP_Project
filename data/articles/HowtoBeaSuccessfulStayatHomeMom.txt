 Our society downplays the stay at mom, but you know that your childis your greatest masterpiece. Feeling inferior will only sabotage your efforts to be successful in the home. You are the queen of your home. Act like one!;
, As a stay at home mother, you are your own boss. Only you will decide if things get done or not. A daily schedule and to do list are very important. Have a basic schedule in which you make time for housework, meals and snacks, naps, play time, study, and personal time. Each morning list five things to accomplish that day. More than five tasks can be overwhelming and create a sense of failure if they aren't completed. Any uncompleted task can be moved to the next day's to do list. Important note: be flexible. Stay at home moms are subject to many interruptions. Maintain routine but make room for changes if they arise. Set aside a nap time, that will help a lot.
 Too many stay at home mothers do not take care of themselves as they should because of their many responsibilities. Schedule in bubble baths, putting on makeup, hair appointments, anything that you need to work at your optimal level. Don't forget some girl time. Staying at home with kids all day can be overwhelming. You always need adult time. A happy, pampered mom is a better mom!

, Children need the security of a loving and firm mother. Requiring obedience from an early age will keep you from unnecessary conflicts and stress. Giving your children age appropriate tasks around the house teaches children to be assets to the family and to society. And it is giving them a sense of responsibility.
 Being at home does not have to limit your development! Learn something new everyday. Schedule in time to read, study, exercise, or write that novel. Be the best example of intelligence, character, and discipline to your children that you can be. You are their primary example.

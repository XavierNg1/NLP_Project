 This quick and easy dessert pizza is a great summer treat and makes use of all the delicious fruits in season. Feel free to add or take away any that you don’t like – it’s a very customizable recipe.

This fruit pizza will take you about 30 minutes to put together and 15 minutes to cook.
The simple dough is made with store-bought sugar cookie dough (16.5 ounces/468 grams).
 Remove the sugar cookie dough from its packaging and press it out flat on a 6-inch round pan. Once the oven is preheated, bake the crust for about 11 to 15 minutes. It should be firm to the touch when it’s ready.Remove the crust from the oven.
Allow the crust to cool while you finish preparing the rest of the dessert.
 Once completed, put the sliced fruits aside. Mix 8 ounces (230 grams) of softened cream cheese and 1 cup (100 grams) of confectioners’ sugar in a medium-sized bowl until it is well-blended.The cream cheese should be softened so that you can easily spread the mixture over the sugar cookie crust.
 Wait until the cookie crust is cool to the touch, then spread the cream cheese sauce thickly over it. Take the fruits you’ve prepared and sprinkle them over the top. Arrange the fruit slices in whatever way that appeals to you. Kids love this part! Reserve a small amount of berries to add last.Drizzle over the fruit with chocolate syrup and sprinkle the remaining berries on the top.
Use a pizza cutter to slice the dessert into wedges and serve immediately.

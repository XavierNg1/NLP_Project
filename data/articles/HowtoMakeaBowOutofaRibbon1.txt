 Make sure it's long enough for making the bow. Always allow extra for easing the bow into shape and leaving a long enough tail.Lay the ribbon length down on a flat surface.;
, Overlap them and you'll have created two loops and two tails. Shape the loops if they're not evident.
 This means checking that both the loops and the tails are the size/length that you want them to be and that they are symmetrical.
 Take it around the back and through the center hole. Pull tightly at the center.

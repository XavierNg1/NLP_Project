 Runecrafting can make you over 500k per hour at high levels.), or buy from mage stores or other players. Or, you can use staffs, but you can only hold one, so choose the staff that needs the most quantity runes (if you are casting a spell that requires 3 fire runes, 4 air runes, and 1 law rune, use an air staff).;
,, Don't waste runes and/or time on chickens, rats, or ducks unless you have a Level 3 character. Be aware that the higher combat level a monster is, the more runes you would need to kill it.
 Unless you have a lot of GP to buy laws(or a very high runecrafting level) it's not recommended to use laws as a method to get your mage level up. If you're saving GP or laws, just walk from place to place.
 Even players with a few combat levels lower than someone else can kill them; what the person wears, their prayer level, mage level, and what spell they use on their victim are all factors.
 Same rule as laws, don't use them for smithing iron unless you're prepared GP or amount wise.

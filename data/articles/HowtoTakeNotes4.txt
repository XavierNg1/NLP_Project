 As with other subjects, you should keep a running (but separated) list of terms with which you are unfamiliar. Define them and, if desired, list pages on which they appear or are particularly relevant. This will help you go back to the text later for clarification if you become confused.
 On another page, you may wish to give brief outlines of important concepts. This will help you by keeping track of ideas which play a significant role in the text you are reading. It can also help you to simplify complex ideas.


Give a detailed explanation for all concepts. List how they arose, important people attached to them, and events in which they played a significant role. If the ideas changed over time, list this and briefly outline how.
 Begin with a general idea of what you’re trying to learn. Use a copy of your lecture outline or an outline of the paper you intend to write. When you see information in the text that is relevant to a topic in your outline, write it down and take note of the page number.


Taking note of the page numbers from which you pull information is very important, especially when writing papers. This will keep you from having to dig back through the text later in order to properly cite your information.
 Color coding your text is probably the easiest way to take notes, though it requires almost no writing. This method will help you to clearly visualize and organize the information. It can easily be adapted into an outline as well, for use in writing papers.


If reading on the computer, you can use highlighting tools to color block sections of information. Assign one color to each of the topics in your outline and then, when you find relevant information in the text, mark it with that color.
If you’re reading from a physical book, you can certainly mark text with a highlighter. It may be easier, however, to use color-coded tabs. These colorful stickers can help you to navigate the pages and find exactly what you’re looking for.

 EHB typically nest in dry, aboveground cavities. If you see an underground cavity brimming with bees, it is likely an AHB hive as they can tolerate the conditions better. Furthermore, EHB rarely nest in exposed areas whereas an AHB nest may be out in the open, such as hanging from an exposed tree branch. AHB usually nest in much smaller places than EHB. For example, a typical EHB hive is a cavity around 10 gallons (38 L) large. For AHB the cavities are 1 to 5 gallons (3.8 to 19 L) in size. This also makes it more difficult to see AHB nests and they are usually only seen once they are provoked.
 AHB will nest in many places regular European honey bees won't. Other possible nesting sites include empty containers, water meters, abandoned vehicles, old tires, lumber piles, outbuildings and sheds. , The best chance of identifying AHB is during their swarming season, which is March through July. Bees swarm as a means to reproduce their colonies. Worker bees will follow the queen from the hive during a swarm.

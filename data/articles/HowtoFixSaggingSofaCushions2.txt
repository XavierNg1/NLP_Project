 If the cushion does not unzip, open it with a thread cutter. Take out all of the stuffing inside the pillow and set it aside.
 Sew the four buttons onto the sofa cushions, two on the front and two on the back. Use the same piece of thread to sew on all four buttons, so that all four buttons are cinched by the thread.


You can also use more or fewer buttons depending on the size of the pillow. A throw pillow might require just two buttons, but a large sofa cushion might
Retrace the thread several times over. You want the cinching to be strong between the buttons so that it lasts a long time., Feel free to also add more polyester fiberfill or quilt matting if you desire. Make sure that the padding is evenly and thoroughly distributed inside the cushion.
 Sew it back together, if you used a thread cutter to open the cushion. Fluff the pillow and put it back on the sofa.

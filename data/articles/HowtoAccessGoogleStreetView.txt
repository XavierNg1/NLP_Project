 Open a web browser on your computer and visit the Google Maps web page.;
, Click on the text field on the top left-hand corner of the web page and type in the name of the location you’d like to see in Street View.


Note that Street View is not available for every location. You can only use this feature on popular places like well-known cities, landmarks, and tourist spots all over the globe.
 On the bottom right-hand corner you’ll see a small human icon. Click on this icon and drag it across the screen onto the place on the map you want to see up close.


If Street View is available for the location, the web page will change into a panoramic picture of that area. As you drag the icon on the map, you’ll see a blue dot appear. This means that a Street View option is available for that place. If the feature is not accessible, the human icon will just go back to its place on the corner.
 Click on the screen and drag your mouse up, down, left, or right across the screen to move around the panoramic picture and see the place in a complete 360-degree view. You can also zoom in and out of the view by using the scroll of your mouse, or by pressing the “+” or “-” buttons on the lower right-hand corner of the screen, respectively.
 To go back to the aerial view of the area, simply click the Back arrow on the top left-hand corner of the web page and you’ll exit Google Maps’ Street View.

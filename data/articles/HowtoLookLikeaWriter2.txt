 Look like you've 'just thrown something on.' Wear things like .. blazers, long scarves, enormous dark sunglasses, dark denim, gray and navy, baggy tops with wide belts, striped things, the whole romantic-gothic look works.


Make sure it's flattering.
If you're a female writer, wear red lipstick, smoky eyes, or just foundation and run.
 When you get to the last strip, decorate it and wear it. Take whatever you have and just make jewelry that looks funky, stylish and original. What's more, it saves materials.

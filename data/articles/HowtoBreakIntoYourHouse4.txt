 You may have a spare hanger in your car or in outdoor storage, but if not you’ll have to go door-knocking until you find a pleasant neighbor who can give you one. Really, any piece of sturdy yet moldable wire will do.


Even thin wire, like the kind use in electrical work, can be doubled up for improved stiffness and used to open your garage door., The rod needs to be as long as possible. If you find that the reach of your hanger is insufficient, wrap the non-hook end around an extension, like a branch.


If possible, double up the wire of the coat hanger to make it sturdier. This may only be possible if you have an extra hanger or leftover wire.
 For some garages, this may be impossible. But if your garage has a gap at its top, you should be able to snake in the rod hook-end first.


You may find it easier to insert the rod from the sides, but it’ll need to be in the center of the door to disengage its lock.
Be careful when doing this if there is a soft plastic molding around the door. Inserting your rod between the molding and the door could cause damage it, which can be expensive to replace., The manual release latch is located just below where the arm for the opener attaches to the garage door track. Maneuver the hook around the latch and pull with firm, steady pressure until the latch disengages. Now you can slide the door up and open.Many garage door releases have a string attached so you can pull and disengage the release from inside the garage. Use this string as a point of reference when looking for the release.
If you can't see into your garage, feel along the door's metal track toward the opener motor. When you feel a ridge poking out of the track to the rear of the motor, you’ve found the release.

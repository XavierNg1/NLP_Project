, While you’re in line, check ahead to be sure other guests have no issues with safety harnesses and belts. If you observe any complaints of loose restraints or dissatisfaction, you should skip the ride. If it comes to be your turn and everything you’ve seen so far checks out, make sure your own restraints fit snugly and lock into place., When you harness yourself in, be sure you fit into the ride’s seat and the harness locks around you comfortably. Pay particular attention if your proportions are especially large or small. If you have any trouble at all, be sure to shout out for assistance to the operator before they start the ride., Avoid rides that specify proportions that aren’t right for your body.

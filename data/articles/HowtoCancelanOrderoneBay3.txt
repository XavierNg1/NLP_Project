 Under normal circumstances, eBay does not allow you to retract a bid on an auction. Placing a bid is considered a commitment to buy if you win the auction. There are a few cases where you may be able to get your bid retracted:

You entered the wrong amount (e.g. $100 instead of $10) due to a mis-type. Changing your mind doesn't count.
The item's description has undergone a significant change since you placed your bid.
You are unable to contact the seller.
 The amount of time left in the auction determines your eligibility for a bid retraction, provided you meet one of the reasons above:

More than 12 hours - You are allowed to retract your bid. All bids you've placed will be removed.
Less than 12 hours - You can only retract bids made within the last hour. Only your most recent bid will be removed.

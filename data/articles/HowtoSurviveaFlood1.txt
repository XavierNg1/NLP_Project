 Sit down with your family to establish a plan of action. Pick several meeting spots in case you need to leave home, such as a friend’s home in a safe town or a shelter in your area. Make sure everyone in the family knows where these locations are and how to get there. Make sure the shelters and the routes to them are through high ground.Call your local Red Cross chapter, emergency management office, or planning and zoning department. These coordinators will have designated shelters, such as schools or stadiums.;
, Print out blank plans on fema.gov. Write down contact information, neighborhood meeting spots, and personal identification details. It’ll make everyone easier to find in case of an emergency.

It’s better to text during the flood. Texts have a better chance of getting through and don’t tie up lines needed for emergencies., Ready a kit that includes basic necessities. A good kit will have enough food and water for everyone for at least three days. Pack at least three gallons of water per person so everyone can drink a gallon a day. Bring a week’s worth of any special medications your family needs and a first aid kit. Pack at least one clothing change for each person. Include warm clothing and rain-resistant gear.Remember to check your food supplies every year. Replace expiring food.
Bring personal identification documents such as passports, driver’s licenses, birth certificates, and bank account numbers. Also pack some extra cash. Store these in a waterproof container.
Think of what you and your family will need to complete your kit. You may include items like a can opener, duct tape, pet supplies, baby supplies, and sanitary items.

 The altered artboard color will not appear in any printed versions of your work. Select “File” and choose “Document Setup” from the drop down menu.This change only exists within Adobe Illustrator. When you print or export your project, the artboard will revert to its original white color. To change the background color permanently, you need to create a separate background layer.
 Locate the “Transparency” section. Check the box next to “Simulate Colored Paper.


The “Simulate Colored Paper” feature mimics actual paper. The darker the paper, the darker your artwork will appear. If you set the background color to black, your artwork would disappear because it would not be visible on real black paper., Within the “Transparency” section, locate the white rectangle. Click on the white rectangle to open up a “Color Palette” dialogue box. Select a color from the palette and click “Ok.” To save the changes you made to the artboard, click “Ok” again.Even though you saved the changes, the new artboard color only exists within Adobe Illustrator. If you print or export your work, the artboard will revert to its original white color. Creating a separate background layer is the only way to permanently change the background color.

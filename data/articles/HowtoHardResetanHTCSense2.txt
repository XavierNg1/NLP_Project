 Long press the Power button until you see the power off message. Slide your finger down to completely shut down your device.


If you can’t use the hardware buttons because your device is frozen, simply remove the battery of your smartphone. Wait a few seconds before reinserting the battery.
 Do this until you see a screen with three different sections appear.


The Volume Down button is found at the left edge of the phone while the Power button is located at the top right of the phone.
 Scroll down the list and select “FACTORY RESET.” Use the Volume buttons to navigate the menu and the Power button to select.


Wait for a couple of minutes and your HTC Sense smartphone will complete the hard reset process.

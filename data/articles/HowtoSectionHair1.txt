 The standard parting method taught in cosmetology schools requires diving the scalp into seven sections: top, right side, left side, right crown, left crown, right nape and left nape.You'll also pull out a half-inch band of hair around the perimeter of the hair line.;
, Use a comb or pick to part your hair beginning at the point on top of one hear, and part across the top of your head to the same point above the other ear. Comb the section forward to separate it from the rest of your hair.
 Separate the top third of the hair you just combed forward.


Fasten the section by twisting it up into a knot and securing it with a medium-sized butterfly clip.
 Clip the remaining right and left thirds of the hair you combed forward.
 Start at the point just behind your ear on one side and part across to the same point behind the opposite ear. The top layer of hair will be used for your crown sections.
 Part the crown section straight down the middle of your head. Clip each half separately.
 Extend the crown part down the middle of your head to divide the nape into right and left sections. Clip each section separately.
 Using your comb or pick, release the strip of hair from one section at a time, around the perimeter of your head. Be sure to follow the perimeter around the front, the sides and under your hair.


Cut the hair. The order you will cut the sections will vary based on the style you are trying to achieve. Some require you to cut from the back up, while others may dictate you cut from the front to the back.

 One advantage of pasta is that it freezes well, whether it’s been combined with sauce or not. Make sure to press all excess air out of the bag before sealing it.The thin material of plastic freezer bags makes them better for freezing than thicker containers.
Drizzle the past with oil or butter before freezing it. The added fat will come in handy during the reheating process, serving to break up frozen clumps.
 Once it’s frozen, the leftover pasta will be preserved for three months or longer. However, you should aim to eat the leftover pasta within one to two months for optimum freshness and flavor. When left frozen for too long, high water content foods like cooked pasta can become freezer burned, which will ruin the flavor and make it difficult to reheat properly.Mark frozen leftovers with the date so you’ll remember to use them before they expire.
 Rather than attempting to thaw the frozen pasta at room temperature, transition it to the refrigerator. This will allow it to reach a mild temperature much more gradually, preserving the flavor and texture. The pasta can then be heated in boiling water and combined with sauce, while sauced pasta can be reheated in the oven.The pasta will likely require a few hours in the refrigerator to thaw completely.
Pasta that has been thawed in the refrigerator will usually be edible for another 3-4 days.

 Your comfort is your top priority. Avoid wearing anything that is tight around your stomach while you are having contractions—this will only increase the pain. Tight clothing can also keep you from finding a comfortable laboring position, and it may make it even harder to change into a nightgown if you are having strong contractions.
 Make sure that it is not too long—knee-length is good. A long gown can become a problem during labor and delivery: it could get in the way of your fetal monitoring or the birth of the baby. Also make sure that any gown you choose is not too short. The A-line dress is very popular for labor; momos, maxis, and nighties also work well.


While you are still in the early stages of labor—before you actually start the delivery process—you may want to stay covered up so that you don't feel exposed.
If you plan to breastfeed right after the birth, make sure that your nightgown buttons down the front at least enough to fully expose your breast.
 This may be loose and comfortable, and it can give you extra emotional support. Make sure that it's an old shirt, or something non-essential—there's a chance that you will stain or rip any clothing that you wear.
 This will allow you to move around between contractions to maximize comfort and support effective breathing. As labor drags on, you may want to remove your bottoms to allow for examinations and fluid discharge.


Wear something that you don't care too much about. Things could get messy.
Remember that other people will be there. Consider how much skin you are comfortable showing., Many women prefer to go bare, especially for water births. You may find that you feel more comfortable and less restricted without clothing sticking to your sweaty body. You don't need to decide right away. You can always remove your gown or your bottoms as your labor progresses.

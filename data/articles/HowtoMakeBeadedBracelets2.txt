Fold the 19 inch strand in half and place it on top of the 26 inch strand. Pull one end of the 19 inch strand down so that it aligns with the two ends of the 26 inch strand. Tie a knot in the two strands approximately ½ inch from the top of the loops. Cut off the short end of the 19 inch strand so that there are three even strands remaining., In order for this bracelet to maintain its shape, you must create a tight, traditional 3-strand braid.

 Pour ¼ cup (2 ounces) of ammonia into a bowl and then fill it the rest of the way with clear, warm water. Be careful not to splash the ammonia out of the bowl – it can burn your skin., In a separate bowl, mix warm water and a few squirts of dish soap. You’ll need this to wash your earrings after they’ve been in the ammonia., Place your earrings carefully in the bowl with ammonia in it. Don’t drop them, as this can cause splashing. Let them soak for twenty minutes.
 You should wear rubber gloves – the kind you use for housecleaning are fine – when dealing with ammonia. After you put on a pair of rubber gloves, carefully remove your earrings from the bowl of ammonia. Then place them in the second bowl with soap and water.
 Swirl your earrings around in the soap and water mixture and then gently scrub with them a toothbrush. Make sure you clean both the gemstones (if there are any) and the metal of your earrings.
 Once you’ve cleaned your earrings, rinse them in warm water, either under a faucet or in a bowl. Then lay them out to dry.

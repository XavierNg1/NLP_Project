 You are a part of the family now. Your husband chose you to be his wife. You have every right to be included as a part of this new family. Building a relationship with your in-laws is very important so do make the effort to visit often and get to know them and allow them the opportunity to get to know you. Do not allow your brother-in-law's wife and her rotten attitude stop you from becoming a member of this family. Do not feel intimidated by the fact that she has been around longer than you. If she cannot handle the fact that there is a new girl in town then that is just too bad for her. You cannot control her thoughts and emotions.;
, You and your husband should invite his brother and sister-in-law over for dinner or set a date to go out on a double date (go bowling, see a movie, or meet for coffee). Use the outing as an opportunity to break the ice with your brother-in-law's wife. After all, she is your husband's "sister" and it would be nice if you could get along with one another. Allow your brother-in-law and his wife to see that you are a real person with only the best intentions. Make them aware of how important it is that everyone get along. Open up about how you felt becoming a member of this new family.
 Give them some time and space. Realize that you have given it all you have and that there is nothing left to give. You can only try for so long before your patience runs out. It is not fair to you to be treated that way so do not send out anymore dinner invitations. If they wish to meet with you then let them come around with an invitation.
 Your brother-in-law's wife goes out of her way to make you feel very uncomfortable. She rolls her eyes at you, she avoids conversation with you, and she gossips behind your back. The best thing to do is ignore this behavior during the first few months. Give her a chance to settle in with the reality that she now has to share the spotlight. If this crude behavior continues then you can either a.) ignore it b.) set up a family meeting to discuss the ongoing problem or c.) begin treating her the same that she treats you (eye for an eye).
 Let him know that you are aware that his sister-in-law does not like you. Also, explain to him how much it hurts you that she goes out of her way to make you feel uncomfortable. He does not have to "fix" the problem for you but he should be supportive and understanding. He may try to argue that his brother's wife is so "nice" and "sweet" but explain to him that her actions are different around you. She does not act in the same way. Luckily, your husband will not be so defensive.
 You have every right to build a relationship with your mother-in-law and father-in-law. Do not be intimidated.
 Let her know that you are aware of how she feels and that you do not appreciate her approach on the situation. Make it be known to everyone in your husband's family that they can talk to you about anything and that going out of their way to make you feel uncomfortable is completely unnecessary.
 If anyone in your husband's family is purposely excluding you from family events, especially for the sake of his sister-in-law, then show up with your husband anyway. Let them know that you are a couple and that you will not tolerate separation.

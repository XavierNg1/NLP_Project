 These are the metal pieces on the outside ends of the handlebars. Depending on the model of your motorcycle, you can either pop them off or unscrew them with a flathead screwdriver.






;
, Use a razor blade or a hacksaw to cut the grips lengthwise and pull them off of the handlebars. As you're cutting, apply enough pressure to slice through the grip, but not so much that you scratch the metal handlebar beneath it.









Be careful not to cut through any wires on the handlebar. Take your time when you're slicing off the grips.
If you want to save the grips, you can blow them off with compressed air. Most people don't have compressed air available at home, so you'll likely have to take your motorcycle to a mechanic to have this done.
Another method to try for saving the grips is slipping a flathead screwdriver between the grip and the handlebar and using it to work the grip off. If there's a lot of adhesive holding the grip in place, this method is difficult.
If you have chrome grips, skip the razor blade and simply unscrew the bolts at the ends of the grips and slide them off.
 Use rubbing alcohol or adhesive remover and a rag to remove remnants of the previous grips. Make sure the grips and the adhesive that attached them to the metal is completely gone before proceeding.









Don't attempt to use any type of oil-based cleaner or lubricant to remove the adhesive. In order for the new grips to stay firmly in place on the handlebars, the metal must be completely free of residue. Using lubricant may cause the new grips to slip, which could result in a dangerous situation on the road.
Make sure the handlebar is clean and dry before proceeding.

 Plant your hibiscus in a pot that is at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) in diameter, or twice the size of the root ball. The container should have drainage holes.;
, Choose a soil that is loamy and well draining. A mixture of 2 parts potting soil, 1 part river sand and 1 part peat moss works well, as hibiscus prefer to be well-drained and aerated.
,, Frequency will depend upon placement of your plant and how much sunlight it receives. Some experts recommend a drip-feed watering system to regulate the moisture.
 Use a 7-2-7 fertilizer, as hibiscus plants prefer a lower amount of phosphorous and only slightly acidic soil. Fertilize once every 2 weeks. Container plants require extra fertilization due to a smaller absorption area.
 Remove all yellowed leaves, and trim back any leggy or sagging branches with pruning shears.

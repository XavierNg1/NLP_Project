 Do this by pressing the Alt key and while holding down the Alt key, pressing the Tab (⇥) key. Thumbnails of all open windows will appear in the middle of the screen. Do not release the Alt key yet. You will notice that one of the thumbnails is highlighted (that is, it is surrounded by a white outline). Press the Tab key again and again until the application window you want is highlighted. Let go of the Alt key and the window you want is selected.
 This means that you press Windows key (the key with the Windows logo in it located at the bottom left side of the keyboard) and then press the right arrow (→) or the left arrow key (←) while holding down the Windows key. This will snap the chosen application window to the right or left half of the screen, respectively.
 Snap Assist will then be activated when you release the Windows key and arrow key. The thumbnails of other open windows will appear on the leftover space. You will notice that one of the windows will be highlighted (surrounded by a white outline). This indicates that this particular window is selected to be snapped to the leftover space when the Enter key is pressed.


If you want another window to be snapped to the leftover space, navigate through the thumbnails by using the arrow keys (or you may just click the window you want snapped in the leftover space to save up on all those keystrokes).
 Press the Enter (↵) key to snap the highlighted window to the leftover space.

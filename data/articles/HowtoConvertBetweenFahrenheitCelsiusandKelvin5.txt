 One of the most important things to remember while converting between Kelvin and Fahrenheit is the rise ratio. Since Kelvin has a 1:1 ratio with Celsius, it has the same ratio to Fahrenheit as Celsius, which is to say that for every 1°K, Fahrenheit changes by 1.8°F., In order to correct for the 1K:1.8F scale, the first step in converting Kelvin to Fahrenheit is multiplying by 1.8.


Let’s say you're starting with a temperature of 295°K. Just multiply that number by 1.8. 295 x 1.8 = 531.
 Just as we must correct for the starting point of the scale by adding 32 when converting Celsius to Fahrenheit, we must also do the same when converting Kelvin to Fahrenheit. However, 0°K = -459.7°F.Since the number we have to add is actually a negative number, that means we must simply subtract the number.


Just subtract 459.7 from 531. 531 - 459.7 = 71.3 °F. Therefore, 295°K = 71.3 °F.
 If your conversion doesn't fit between two lines of this table, try again. You may have made a math mistake, or forgotten to multiply before subtracting.


If you start with an integer value of kelvins, your answer in degrees Fahrenheit will end in the decimal .67 (if ºF is negative) or .33 (if ºF is positive).

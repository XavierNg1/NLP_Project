 People often carelessly chalk their cue over the top of the table, but the fine grittiness of chalk can slowly wear away the felt. Keep the table top clean by always chalking your cue off to the side of the table rather than over the table’s surface.Don’t be afraid to tell guests that you don’t want them to chalk over the table. They won’t think about it if you don’t tell them, and it’s your table so it’s okay to have rules.
 Pool table felt attracts animal hair from shedding pets. Dirt and dust get into the felt, so keep it covered whenever you aren’t using it to prolong the life of the felt.Pool table covers are often included in the purchase, but if you don’t have one, it is a worthwhile investment to protect your table.
Even if you don’t have a cover and don’t want to buy one, lay a clean sheet, tarp, or blanket over the table which will still keep it cleaner than being uncovered.
 Never set food or drinks on the table. Never hold cigarettes or cigars over the table. Place some stools, tables, or shelves near your pool table to avoid setting things on the table. Set ashtrays near by if you have smokers playing on the table.This rule applies to anything that does not belong on the table, including but not limited to messy kids toys, pets and pet supplies, chemicals and cleaning products, and dirty clothes or shoes.
Preventative measures will keep the table clean so that you don’t have to do more work than necessary.

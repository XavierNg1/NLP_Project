 You can start casually, but be sure to leave the impression that you're going to have ask something, so that the person don't think you are just chit chatting. Avoid being too affectionate, that would maybe scare the person. But don't be too casual, or else when you ask him, he might be shocked and so confused he might immediately disagree to the idea.;
, Be sure you both have the time to talk together. It wouldn't be an appropriate time to ask if the person is in a hurry. Then he might feel forced to give an answer without thinking about it. Also, don't make it too obvious or oblivious that you are going to ask them out, you don't want them to say no before you have asked or wonder why you ask.
 This is probably the hardest to do. What you should do is, just get it out. Ask, without being overly confident, but not too shy either. If you are to confident and make reasons why, he might reject you.
 Well, good for you! Now, plan where and what you are going to do, and have a good time! And if you stay together, don't cheat!

, Move on. Maybe try again after a good time (a couple of weeks) if you feel like it. Don't be mad, and if the person doesn't explain the motive, then don't ask. Don't seem desperate, just let it go, and be happy.

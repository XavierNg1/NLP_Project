 Buy the cheapest stove or grill and have a Sim with low cooking skill try to cook with it. Alternatively, place flammable objects near a fireplace, and have the Sim stoke the fireplace repeatedly. Sims on fire for one game hour die and become red ghosts.


Some Sims have hidden traits that allow them to survive three hours on fire. Firefighters cannot be killed by fire.
The expansions add many, many other ways to start fires. These are not listed below, since they don't give any unique results.;
, Have a Sim with low Handiness attempt to repair or upgrade an electric device several times. The first accident will "singe" the Sim, and the second will kill him if the singed moodlet is still active. Increase the odds by standing in a puddle, and trying to repair expensive, complex devices. Your Sim's ghost will be yellow.


A Sim with the Handy trait cannot die this way. A Sim with high handiness is unlikely to die this way.
The Sim needs at least 1 Handiness to have the option to tinker.
 Remove fridges, oven, stove and phone so that your Sim has no way of getting food. You could also wall your Sim up in a room. After about 48 game hours, the Sim will die and turn into a purple ghost.
 Pools were infamous in earlier Sims games, since the Sims wouldn't climb out if you removed the ladder. They've become smarter in Sims 3, so you'll need to build a wall around the pool edge instead. Drowned Sims leave behind a blue ghost.

 Foam mattresses should not be exposed to excessive water, so you need to take a cautious approach when spot cleaning stains. It is easy to get too aggressive when removing stains from a foam mattress, which can have the unintended effect of either pushing stains deeper into the mattress or getting the mattress too wet. If the mattress gets wet, it could easily get mildew.


Never saturate the mattress with water or a cleaning agent.
Instead of using a steam cleaner or a wet rag, you should use a spray bottle. You are less likely to get the mattress excessively wet if you mist the mattress with a small amount of water using a spray bottle., To get stains out of a foam mattress, you will need vinegar, baking soda or an enzymatic commercial cleaner. Enzymatic cleaners work very well, but vinegar is a trusted option that is also inexpensive.You can use a mix of half white vinegar and half water in a spray bottle.
You can sprinkle baking soda directly on the stain.
Follow the directions on the bottle of enzymatic cleaner.
 After spraying a moderate amount of cleaning agent on the stain, let it sit for five minutes., After the cleaning agent has had a chance to break down the stain, use a clean rag to remove it. Use a dabbing, up and down motion, as opposed to a circular rubbing motion.If you rub the cleaning agent around too much, you could end up spreading the stain.
 Let the baking soda sit on the stain overnight. In the morning, vacuum up the baking soda. This process should help remove any odors associated with the stain., Since foam mattresses do not do well when they are wet, you need to get your mattress dry as soon as possible. If you have access to an outdoor area and it is good weather, you could let the mattress dry out in the sun. If the weather is not amenable, you could set up a fan in your room to let the mattress dry out.

 If you are insured, you are at least partially covered for substance abuse treatment. The Affordable Care Act of 2008 requires that insurance providers offer similar coverage for substance abuse treatment that they do for other medical conditions. The Affordable Care Act also stipulates that insurance companies cannot deny you coverage because of your addiction. So, you if you can afford it, try to obtain insurance coverage before entering treatment to help offset your out-of-pocket costs. When you call your insurance company, have your card and membership information available. Take notes on what the representative tells you and get their name in case you have to follow up at a later time.
Ask questions like, “What levels of care are covered?” and “What are my co-pays or deductibles?”
Ask how they determine whether treatment is medically necessary.
 Depending on your age and income level, as well as other factors, you may be eligible for these federal programs.


Medicaid, which provides coverage for some low-income people and those with disabilities, is one of the largest payers for substance abuse services in the country. Medicare coverage is for those who are age 65 or older and have fulfilled certain requirements, such as paying into the Medicare pool during at least 10 years of work.Substance abuse services, such as inpatient treatment, are covered by Medicare.
 Each of the 50 states offers substance abuse treatment funded by government money.

After contacting your state agency, you will have to provide proof of residency, income information, and other data that will help them determine whether you are eligible for free treatment.Since state funding is limited, you may have to be placed on a waiting list before receiving treatment.

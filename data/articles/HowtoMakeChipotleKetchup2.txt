 Pour a 12 ounce (355 ml) can of whole tomatoes into a food processor. Puree the tomatoes until they reach a smooth consistency. Then, strain any liquid from the tomato puree. Discard the liquid and put the pureed tomatoes aside for later use., Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a saucepan on the stove over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add a diced yellow onion. Cook the onion until it becomes soft and translucent., Add two tablespoons of brown sugar to the onions. Continue to cook for an additional two minutes. The brown sugar should coat the onions., Then, add the tomato puree, two minced chipotle peppers, two tablespoons of cider vinegar, two teaspoons of tomato paste, and two teaspoons of coriander. Stir the ingredients in order to fully combine them., Let the ingredients simmer on the stove until the sauce thickens. This will take approximately 25 minutes, but could take longer depending on your desired thickness. Once the sauce is ready, add salt and pepper to taste and then let it cool before serving., After the ketchup has cooled, place it in a tightly sealed container and store it in the refrigerator. This chipotle ketchup will last in the fridge for approximately one month., You can include additional spices in this recipe in order to gain a more complex flavour.

 Light cottons work perfectly for most occasions. Nicer fabrics like chiffon work well for dressier occasions, and lightweight linen makes a nice choice for casual days.
 Blouses with a loose fit and "breezy" feeling pay homage to warmer weather, helping you look stylish and feel comfortable. Loose-fitting garments do not mean oversized or baggy, however.
 Delicate floral prints look especially nice and pay tribute to the blooming flowers outdoors. Many other prints may also work well, though. Look into polka dots, paisley, and navy stripes.
 If the weather is just starting to warm up, the maxi dress may help you regulate your body temperature. Breezy cuts and designs keep you from overheating, but the length of the skirt also prevents your legs from getting too cold.
 Knee-length dresses are classic and flatter nearly any figure. This length also helps you to stay cool once the weather really starts getting warm.
 Think floral prints and pastel shades like buttercup yellow or sky blue.
 Choose a short-sleeve, tailored design in a light color. The polo shirt is a smart wardrobe piece for semi-professional dress and other occasions that require a little more structure in you apparel.
 You can layer them beneath other clothing while the weather is still cool, or wear them on their own if the temperature starts climbing early.
 Fitted t-shirts are incredibly versatile. Wear them on days you feel like being casual, or dress them on days you feel like being more stylish.
 A tunic is a loose-fitting garment that comes down to your mid-thigh. They are often made of cotton or some other lightweight material, making them perfect for spring weather. Choose one with short sleeves or three-quarter-length sleeves to keep yourself feeling cool.

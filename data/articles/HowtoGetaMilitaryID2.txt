If, however, it is not completed, retirees must still fill out the form to be part of the DEERS database., Depending on your military involvement (i.e. Active Duty, Reserves, National Guard), or the level of your service-related disability, there are two possible options for retiree ID cards. Either of these forms can be filled out beforehand, or when you arrive on site.



DD FORM 2 – A blue ID card is issued after filling out this form. Those who may submit this form are the following former military members:

Retirees who are receiving retired pay, or are entitled to retired pay
Former service members who are on the Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL)
Former service members who are on the Permanent Disability Retired List (PDRL)DD FORM 2A – A red card is issued after filling out this form. The DD FORM 2A is specifically for people under the age of 60 who are retired from the Reserves or National Guard., Most military bases will allow someone on post with a temporary pass if they don’t have a military ID. You’ll need a valid reason to get through the gate, but if you tell them you need to get your retired ID card they’ll most likely let you through.


Be sure to get directions to the MILPO location and head there directly. You will only be permitted to go to the locations you’ve been authorized.
Your car will most likely be inspected prior to being allowed on post. Be sure to remove firearms from the vehicle beforehand.
Bring your proof of retirement from the military, along with the aforementioned forms.
Once you present all the appropriate forms, you should receive your appropriate retiree ID card.

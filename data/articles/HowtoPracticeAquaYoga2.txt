 Anytime you're going to a new fitness class, consider getting there a little early. This can help you get acquainted and be more prepared for the class.


If you've never done aqua yoga before, get to your class about 10-15 minutes early.
Use that time to get acquainted with the instructor. Let them know this is your first class and ask where the best spot is in the pool and if she has any tips for beginners.
Also use that time to set up your station or area. You'll need to have your water bottle and towel close by.
Many aqua yoga classes also use some equipment - like pool noodles and kick boards. Getting there early allows you to get all the right equipment ready at your station.
 Aqua yoga does require some specific clothing. However, it's most likely things you already own and use on a regular basis.


In general, because this class is taught in a pool, a swimsuit is the best and most appropriate attire for this class.However, if you're very uncomfortable in a swimsuit, a fitted topped and shorts are also appropriate.
Remember, that during aqua yoga, the majority of your body (especially your lower half) will be completely submerged in the pool, so there's no need to feel overly self conscious.
 Fortunately, aqua yoga doesn't require a lot of specialty equipment or yoga gear. However, there are a few things you should bring with you.


For starters, you'll definitely want to bring a towel. A large beach or pool towel is best.
Also, consider bringing an extra set of clothing. That way, after class is over, you can head to the locker room and change out of your wet suit or clothing.
Even though aqua yoga is a low intensity and low impact exercise, you will be moving for 45-60 minutes. A water bottle to help re-hydrate you is essential as well.

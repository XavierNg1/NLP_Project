,, Or maybe I'll do that for you. You will need these things to become a free traveler.


passport
a car
a car roof rack for storing supplies
small light backpack with thermos holder on it
guides and road atlas's of were you are going
a pen to mark locations on road atlas
a heavy duty water thermos
heavy duty flashlight
pocket knife or survival knife (survival knife recommended)
a heavy duty lighter (be sure its not one of those tiny little cheap ones)
cargo (food, water)
a tent (heavy duty! If sleeping somewhere dangerous you don't want poisonous spider's sneaking in and biting you in the middle of nowhere)
blankets (to keep things compact and small keep it with the tent)
a checklist (so that you can plan future travels and budgets)
backup travel money for emergencies (I suggest keeping about 200 dollars on you at least. But that doesn't mean you have to spend it)
if wanted A PARTNER! to keep you company!
a liking for people. Just in case you pick up a small job at a local restaurant or something of that sort for extra money
a compass or tracking GPS

, when you become a free traveler you need to be able to respect and understand all cultures and all people and if your nice enough you might get paid along your journey.
, to agree to go on this journey with you.
 Know were to camp, know were to eat, know were to sleep!

,, Save that money and then once having enough go over sea's! well then I predict pretty soon you will have covered much of the earth.

 First off, make sure you are kissing for you, not because your friends dared you to, or you have been dating so long you are far past the make out point. Do this for you, so make sure you are ready to kiss him, both physically and emotionally.;
, Have a fresh breath, soft lips, look nice, and make sure that the "touch barrier" has been broken with hugs, and flirtatious gestures.
 This task is harder than people think, if it's hard to get into a place that is private, then the school might be the best place there is for now, just make sure that you aren't being watched by a teacher or any other unwanted viewer.
 If it's the end of the day, and you both are about to go your separate ways, then now is your chance, give him a hug and hold it for about 5 seconds, then pull back a bit, but don't move your arms.
 Forget about being nervous. Think about this going great, because if you do this step properly, kissing will be the easiest thing in the world. Look into his eyes, tilt your head just a bit to avoid colliding, and lean in and gently close your eyes, and kiss him.
 Hold the kiss for about 10 seconds, keeping your eyes closed, after about 10 seconds, pull away, smile at him, and be happy for the rest of the day.

 Have some spares to cope with the possibility of messing up.;
, Markers of good quality can also be used in place of paint but will require more layers and trial and error than paint.
 If you are using paint, this is an essential step.
 Add the features that you would like to see on your soldiers. Surf the internet for images, or borrow a suitable book from the library with pictures of the military uniform you wish to copy.
 If they don't turn out like you hoped, either paint over them, or they can be blown up in a movie of the army men. The more soldiers that you paint, the better you will become at recreating the ideal uniforms.
 You can go beyond the uniform to create a range of other painted effects. For example, to make them look like war victims, get a small pocket knife and carefully cut off a limb or two. If you would like two warring parties, paint different uniforms for each half of your set. If you need some civilians, paint ordinary clothes on a few.

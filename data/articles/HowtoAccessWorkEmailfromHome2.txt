 Different businesses have different company policies for accessing email outside of work. Your IT department may also have special instructions you'll need to follow while getting your connection to your email account configured.
 If your business uses Exchange or Office 365 for Business, you can add the account to Outlook on your Windows or Mac computer.
 This will display account information for your current accounts.
 This will let you add a new account to Outlook.
 Outlook will automatically detect the type of server that you are connecting to. You'll likely be prompted for your password again during the setup process.


Note that Outlook 2016 only supports setting up Exchange accounts using the automated system, and your Exchange administrator will need to have configured your server to allow this. Outlook 2016 does also not support Exchange 2007 servers., After you log in with your account, you'll be able to send and receive work email using this Outlook client. Just select your work inbox from the left navigation menu.

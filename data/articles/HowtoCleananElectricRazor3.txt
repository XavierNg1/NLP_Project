 Switch the razor to the “off” position and disconnect the power cord from the wall outlet. Remove the protective cap, snap off the cutting head and disconnect any other removable parts, such as an additional lubricating strip or length guard.Assuming you don’t own a self-cleaning model and it’s been awhile since the last time you gave your razor a thorough cleaning, your best bet will be to break the razor down and manually clean every accessible part.
 Add a few drops of mild liquid soap to a sinkful of hot water. Take a brush to the cutting head and other removable parts of the razor, then swish them through the soap solution to fully clean them. Afterwards, run each piece under a stream of hot water to rinse them.Cleaning the blades with soap will help cut through the congealed oil and skin residue that has a tendency to accumulate inside the cutting mechanisms.
Avoid getting any pieces that are directly connected to the battery or electrical input wet.
 Wet a washcloth with warm water and wring out the excess. Go over any parts of the razor that aren’t directly washable but might contain traces of hair and debris, like the edges of the frame and the collar that holds the cutting head in place. Immediately dry any standing moisture with a towel.Use a corner of the washcloth to scrub the edges of the frame beneath the cutting head.
Remove as much debris as possible. Any particles left behind could be pulled back into the blades once the cutting head is reattached.
 Pat each piece gently with a towel, then set them aside to finish air drying. This should only take about half an hour or so. You should not attempt to reassemble or turn on your razor until it has dried completely.Avoid using a hair dryer or any other artificial means to speed up the drying process. This may result in irreparable damage to your razor.

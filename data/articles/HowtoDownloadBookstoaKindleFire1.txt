 This is the page that you will see by default when you turn your Kindle on. Just remember that before you can download books to your Kindle, you'll need to connect it to WiFi and to register it., This option is on the top of the screen, next to Newsstand and Music. This will take you to a "shelf" where all of the books you have received or downloaded will appear.
 You can find this option in the upper right hand corner. It will have a little arrow pointing to the right.
 Check out all of the available books in the Kindle store. You can browse by category such as "bestsellers" or "non-fiction" by tapping "Browse books" or you can search for specific titles by typing the name of the book in the search field.


You can also search "free books" for a list of available free books.
 Tap on the book and you'll be taken to a screen that lists the price of the book, its rating, cover, and description. If the book is available as a rental, you'll see a "Rent now with 1-Click" button. If the book is available as a sample, you'll see a "Try a Sample" button. Trying a sample first is a free and easy way to see if you'd like to read the rest of the book., If you're an Amazon Prime member, then you'll be eligible to "Borrow for Free" if this is an available option. The "Buy" option will charge the default 1-click payment method to your Amazon.com account. Then your item will begin downloading to your Kindle Fire.


If you aren't logged in, you may be asked to enter your username and password to proceed.
Wait for your book to finish downloading. Once it's done, you'll see a "Read now" button.
 Click on your "Books" tab again and select the book to start reading.

 Allow enough time for rest stops. Two hours of car time, then a break, makes a good pattern.;
, Also, pack some new wrapped surprises for little kids. But don't give out all the loot at once!

,, Bring story for the whole family on the car stereo system, or bring individual players for your kids. Play pint-sized board-games. Clue, Sorry, Trouble... are oldies but goodies.
 Burger King and McDonald's have great playrooms on major highways. Let the kids burn off energy while you order their food "to go" to eat later in the car.
 Every school and most parks have them! Little limbs need to shake, rattle, and roll.
 Buy the fixings' at a deli or grocery store, and find somewhere scenic where the kids can run around. You save money, too.
 it's worth bringing a training potty, if your child has need-to-go-NOW emergencies; although if they're older, then they'll have to hold.
 Kids fall asleep easily in the car, and a snooze can be a great way to let the miles fly by. Just be sure to allow lots of wakie-wakie time. Rousing a child from deep sleep because "we're there now" is tough.

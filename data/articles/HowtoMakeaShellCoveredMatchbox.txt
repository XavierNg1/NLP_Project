 If you live near a beach, take a walk and collect some pretty small shells. If you don't have a beach close by, look in craft stores or online for small shell collections. You'll also need a matchbox or two.;
,, The color can match the shells or be in contrast with them.


Don't glue the paper or cloth over the matchbox drawer. You need to be able to access this still. Instead, cut out small pieces of paper or cloth the exact size of the drawer ends and glue at each end separately.
 You can add shells to just one surface, or to the top and sides, or all over. You can create a pattern, or simply add the shells randomly.
 Glue each shell to the top (and any other part of the box). Leave to dry before gluing shells to additional sides or the base of the box.
 These could be beads, costume gems, glitter, lace, ribbon, bows, etc. Decide whether these will form part of the pattern or will be additional decorative elements on top.
 It's useful for keeping pins and needles in a sewing basket, paperclips on a desk, earrings/rings, etc. on a dressing table and tacks in the kitchen, etc.

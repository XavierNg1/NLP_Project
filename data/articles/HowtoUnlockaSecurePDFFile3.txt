 This site will remove the owner lock from PDF files that are 5 MB (or less) in size for free.
 You can do this by dragging the PDF into the PDFUnlock window and dropping it there, or you can select the My Computer option to open the PDF from your system.


If you select Dropbox or Google Drive, you will need to sign into your respective account in order to select the file you wish to convert.
 If your file is eligible for unlocking, PDFUnlock will do so and then automatically download the unlocked PDF to your computer.


If the PDF is also user-locked, you'll need to enter the password in PDFUnlock's provided field before you can click Unlock!.
 You should now be able to edit the PDF's information.

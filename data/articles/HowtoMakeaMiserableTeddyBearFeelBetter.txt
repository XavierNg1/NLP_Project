 If it doesn't tell you, it may be too stressed out, annoyed or doesn't really want to tell you cause it might be about you, so be gentle and kind. Tell the bear that it'll be alright. It might actually tell you at this stage, but if it doesn't, just take care of it some more and forget about asking him/her.


Do not pressure the bear, or it may get even more upset. Simply comfort it by giving it a cuddle, making it a warm drink or reading a story to it.

, Don't smother your bear, give it its own space to think about what's wrong. In time it may realize that the best thing to do will be to open up and tell you so that the problem can be sorted.
 This should at least make it smile. If it smiles, that's good! That means the bear's already on its way to feeling better.
 If the bear is too big to be cradled, just put it on your lap and stroke it gently. If you like, you can give the bear one of its favorite toys.
 Your bear will feel much happier (and sleepier) afterward.
 If it's near feeding time, feed it breakfast, lunch or dinner. Just make it feel comfortable.
 Your bear might forget all about it if you do something fun enough.
 If you neglect your toy, that may be the reason why it is miserable. Try to spend as much time with the bear as you can, and try to take it everywhere you go, but be careful that it doesn't get lost!

, If it's bedtime, tuck the bear in and tell it that things will be better in the morning. Read or sing to the bear until it falls asleep.
 It may only be tiredness that's making your bear grouchy!

, Never yell, or neglect your teddy bear and it should feel better.
 Keep your bear happy.

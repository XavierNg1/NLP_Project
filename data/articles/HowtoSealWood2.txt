 Pour your polyurethane over the end grain of your wood piece, and let it run down the sides smoothly.


Wet a clean rag with polyurethane, and smooth it around the face of the wood.
Polyurethane is self-leveling because it is thin enough to spread out on its own, meaning that you should not have to worry too much about achieving an even coat.
 Use long strokes with a clean brush or rag (a rag with wipe-on polyurethane is the easiest method) to spread out the polyurethane.


Make sure to use extra polyurethane for the end grain (the exposed, cut part of wood on the end of the piece), because this is the most absorbent part of the wood.
Work from one side to the other, trying to keep the distribution of polyurethane on the surface of the wood equal and smooth.
Wear gloves during this entire procedure to avoid staining your hands.
 Apply several coats of polyurethane to the surface of the wood, waiting for each coat to dry in between applications.


Keep an eye out for any polyurethane drips, and smooth them out to avoid a bumpy finish.
Sand between coats to smooth out any uneven areas.
Reapply coats of polyurethane until your desired finish is attained.
Use fine steel wool after the last coat to take away dust particles and buff out the last coat, but don't do this if you are using a glossy polyurethane.
Drying time varies, so make sure you read your polyurethane's instructions and keep an eye on the ambient temperature and humidity.

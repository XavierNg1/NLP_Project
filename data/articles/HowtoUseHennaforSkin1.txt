Will the weather permit me to reveal more parts of my body so it can be shown?
Do I have any formal events to attend in the next couple of days that may call for location discretion?
Questions like these can help narrow down what part of your body you want the henna to be drawn. Popular locations are the hands, arms and feet.;
, Choosing a henna design can be a little bit overwhelming. Henna designs are unlimited, even within the traditional realm.


Picking a design is easy if you have a visual representation of what you want to do; you can also play around with you own design.
Go on the Internet and look up “henna designs” in your search engine. There are many different foundations that you can choose from.
Most people like floral designs; some people like paisley designs, or free hand patterns.

 Sealing your granite countertop every couple of years is a good way of making sure that you don't have to clean very much. A granite countertop is properly sealed when water splashed on the surface beads up. When water no longer beads up on the surface of the countertop, it's time to give it a good seal.
 You can make one of your own, as you might have in Method One, or you can buy one from a specialty store.
 Give the granite a good 10 to 15 minutes to make sure all moisture has evaporated before moving on to the next step.
 Make sure the sealant covers each area of the granite. In order to ensure this, it's best to use a sealant that has been transferred to a spray bottle.


Do not wipe the sealant into the granite. Wiping the sealant with a cloth or paper towel absorbs the sealant into the cloth, not into the stone. For best results, resist the urge to wipe the sealant. Let it do its own thing.
, If you see a haze effect on the surface of the granite, be aware that it cleans off â€” it won't be permanent. Your granite countertop is now expertly sealed!

 It usually features the artwork of the legendary Pokémon in that game. Do you want Arceus, Groudon, Lugia, or Rayquaza? Perhaps you'd like to sport Zekrom or Giratina.

 It can be a painful decision if your favourites are split across different versions, but you might find someone to trade with later on!, In Pokémon Black, for instance, you have access to Black City (for your reference, this is a city containing a bunch of tough trainers with Pokémon from levels 50-65), a couple of rotation battles, and an opportunity to make the occasional 10,000 coins. Pokémon White allows you to enter the White Forest, where you can catch old favourites from the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions, all at level 5. There are some trainers to battle, too. Don't worry, though: with 'game sync' you can access the other version (if you have Black 2, you can connect with White 2 via Game Sync) as long as you have a friend with the other version.

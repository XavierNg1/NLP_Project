 Microwave presses are available for purchase, but you can easily make one yourself. Press the flowers between two ceramic tiles held together with rubber bands.









Don't place a regular flower press in the microwave. This could start a fire.
You may microwave a book flower press, but only if you're sure the book does not have metal parts.
 Use printer paper or a coffee filter if you wish.









Since the flowers will dry quickly in the microwave, there is no need for extra blotter paper in this method.
 Using the directions outlined above, choose flowers to lay flat or arrange artistically. You are only limited by the size of the tile.
 Add a second sheet of paper on top of the flower arrangement, followed by a piece of cardboard, followed by the second tile. Secure the press with two rubber bands.
 Start by microwaving it on low for a minute, then open the press and check the results. Continue microwaving in short increments until the flowers are completely pressed and dry.

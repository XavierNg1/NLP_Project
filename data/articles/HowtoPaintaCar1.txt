 You will need a place with excellent ventilation, minimal dust, good lighting, electricity, and lots of room to work around the vehicle. Residential garages are not usually suitable because of the presence of water heaters or furnaces that may cause ignition of paint fumes which can accumulate during the painting process.
 See "Things You'll Need" for a complete list, but here is a general outline:

Painting equipment
Paint
Sanding and polishing tools and supplies
Safety equipment

,, Much of the body panel moldings used on cars can be snapped off and snapped back on easily, but if a gentle attempt to remove it is not successful, do not try to force it off. Some stores sell tools that aid in the process of removing trim.
 How much you choose to sand is up to you, but the best results will require removing the paint down to bare metal, re-priming the surface with an automotive primer, and then applying your finish paint.
, Make sure that there are no holes in the masking tape and paper that will allow overspray to get through.

Covering your garage with plastic is also a good idea to avoid permanently coloring the room

 If you turn up your blow dryer to the hottest setting, you may be making your hair greasier. The heat causes the scalp to produce more sebum and oil, so your hair looks greasy. Instead of using heat, use the cool setting on your blow dryer when you need to dry your hair.To make it easier to dry your hair with cool hair, gently towel dry it to remove some of the moisture and then allow it to air dry for 10 to 15 minutes before using your blow dryer.
 If your hair is greasy and flat between washes, dry shampoo is your new best friend. It soaks up excess oil at your scalp and adds volume, so your hair looks fresh. Apply dry shampoo whenever your hair looks oily, and it isn’t time to wash yet.To use the dry shampoo, hold the bottle 10 to 12 inches (25.2 to 30.4 cm) from your head, and spray it on your roots. Use your fingers to work the dry shampoo into your hair so there’s no powdery residue. Brush and style your hair as usual.
 The right hairstyles can help conceal the fact that your hair is oily. Pulled back styles, such as a ponytail or top knot, are ideal because they’re meant to have slick look that the oil in your hair can provide.Brush and pull your hair back as tightly as possible for a pony or bun to create the sleekest look for your oily hair.

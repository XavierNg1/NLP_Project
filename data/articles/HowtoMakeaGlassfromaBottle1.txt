 They are available for $18 to $50 on Amazon and other online retail websites. Choose a model with a base that holds the bottle in place.;
, Clean them out and leave them to dry overnight.
 Decide how tall you want your glass to be by adjusting the base of the cutter.
, You should hear the blade scraping against the surface of the bottle. You should feel when the blade reconnects with the original starting point.
 Heat the scored line above the heating element. Turn the glass constantly and allow the flame to just lick the surface of the glass.
 Once you feel it is fairly hot, it is time to change the temperature on the surface of the glass.
 Move it horizontally. If the change in temperature is great enough, you should hear the glass click to indicate it is breaking along the score line.


If it does not click, return it to the heating element for a few more minutes.
 If an area of the glass is thicker, you may need to place it over the flame for a little while longer, and then apply ice across the line.
 Move gently and slowly to reduce the risk of vertical cracks and uneven edges.
 If the cut was extremely even, you can reserve it as a funnel for future craft projects.
 Pour some silicone carbide dust onto the glass. Wet it with a tsp. of water.


Silicon carbide is the dust used to make emery boards.
 Move the top of the glass in a circular motion against the silicon carbide. Do this for one to two minutes.
 File down the edges further with fine-grit sandpaper.

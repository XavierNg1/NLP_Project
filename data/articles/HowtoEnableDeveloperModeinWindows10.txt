, When you are downloading apps from third parties, your personal data and device could be at risk. Microsoft has a host of different protocols that apps are required to meet before they are put up on this Windows Store. They also have various ways of detecting unwanted software before it is installed on your device. So when they warn you, make sure to take it seriously. With all of the major security breaches in recent years, it is all the more important to remain cautious.
 For those of you who are concerned about license renewal, you don't need to be. There is no longer a 30-day limit to your developer license in Windows 10. Yet another reason to upgrade! No more tweaking the registry either. Finished.
 In Windows 10, there is a simplified settings menu that any user can understand. Click Start >> Settings to open it. You should now see a series of 9 different categories available to you.
 From the list given, click the “Updates & Security” option. You should now see a new page with a series of 6 different menu options down the left-hand side of the window. Click “For developers.” It should be the very last option on the bottom.
 You should now see a series of 3 different options with fill circles to the left of each. The top “Don’t use developer features” option should be selected by default. The bottom option is the option that you are looking for. Click to fill the circle to the left of “Developer mode.” Once you click it, you should see a little box pop up with a warning that says that installing third-party apps could expose personal information and device to security risks. If you are alright with that, go ahead and click the “Yes” button to continue. Developer mode is now enabled.

 Talk with your spouse about what faith means to each of you, where your faith came from, and what role it plays in your life. Stay open and non-judgmental. Work on understanding your spouse better, not turning the conversation into a debate.For example, you might say, "As a Buddhist, I am driven towards finding peace in my everyday actions. My spirituality isn't just a set of rules but a way of living and being."
It’s a good idea to have this conversation on a regular basis, since people’s religious beliefs and perspectives often shift throughout life.
 Talk with your spouse about where you want your life to take you, how you want to develop your faith, and where you see your marriage fitting into your plan. Ask your spouse to share their hopes and expectations, too. Together, develop a plan that works for both of you.You might ask, for example, "How will we celebrate religious holidays since we have separate faiths?"

, If you and your spouse keep running into the same conflicts or incompatibilities, don’t ignore them – figure out how to fix them. Think about where you can give a little ground, and offer to compromise however you can. Don’t set your beliefs aside to keep the peace, though.Make sure your compromises are a joint effort. If not, you or your spouse will end up feeling resentful.
For example, you might go through the calendar and decide how you will celebrate different holidays or holy weeks. Some, you might celebrate together, while you might choose to celebrate others separately.
 For interfaith couples, marital counseling can be a good way to learn better communication and conflict resolution strategies. Consider seeing a counselor to keep your marriage strong, healthy, and mutually respectful.You don’t need to be having marriage problems to see a counselor. Counseling can help prevent major problems from occurring in the first place.

 There are several ways to play a D major chord on the guitar, but this version is the simplest. Learn the fingering, and then practice your strumming until you can play the chord clearly. Press the strings firmly, but try not to tense up!

, Put your index finger on the second fret of the third (G) string. Place your middle finger on the second fret of the first (high E) string. Then, place your ring finger on the third fret of the second (B) string. Leave the top three strings open.








The index finger is forming an A note. The middle finger is making the F# note. The ring finger is creating D. Together, these three notes make up the D major chord.If you are playing a regular guitar, you will finger the chord with your left hand. You will use your right hand for strumming.
 Once your fingers are in place, use your right hand to strum downward from the D (4th) string. Only play the highest four strings: D, G, B, and high E. Do not touch the low E or the A string.Keep practicing the chord until you can generate a clear, crisp-sounding chord.

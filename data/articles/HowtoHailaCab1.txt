If there’s no one around you, try looking it up online using your phone. Go to the official website for the city you’re in and look for tips on hailing a cab.
 Once you've spotted an available cab, step off the curb to make yourself more visible. Don't step out too far into the street, and make sure you look out for oncoming traffic., Be firm and confident so the cab driver knows you want to be picked up. Raise your arm up high to make it more visible to the driver.

A cab driver that feels confident you need a ride is more likely to pull over., Politely tell the driver the address of your destination and then get in the backseat. If you’re hailing a cab in a busy area with lots of traffic, hop in the backseat of the cab before you tell your driver your destination so cars aren’t lining up behind you.

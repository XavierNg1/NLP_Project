, You'll go through several levels of time and date setting including the settings, hours, minutes, month, date, year and vibe. If you see the Beep option on the top level, you know you've gone too far and you must back out (save, as described later, and begin with holding set button in and continue from there once again) and back into this again or go around the dial until you reach this option.

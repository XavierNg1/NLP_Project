 A clove is one of the small, wedge-shaped pieces that make up the entire "head" of garlic. Simply pull one off the cluster with your finger tips.


You can cut away the papery white skin as well to make this easier.;
, If there is a hard, thin brown "top" on the clove. Slice it away with your kitchen knife. This makes peeling slightly easier, but it is not strictly necessary, and some cloves will not have much of a stub to remove.









You can also cut the clove in half. This may make it easier to ultimately remove the skins., Lay it flat side down, so that the part of the clove that was nearest to the center of the head faces away from you., You want a quick, firm strike with the heel of your hand. You'll hear a light crunch. Remove the blade to see the skin detached from the clove.
 You may need to practice a bit to learn how much pressure you can apply, but when you lift the knife you'll find that the skin comes right off.
 Your clove is now ready for cooking.

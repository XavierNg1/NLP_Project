 If you struggle to feel secure in a relationship, practice good communication skills. Ask people to speak directly and honestly to you without using sarcasm. When you speak with others, put most of your energy on listening to what they say and understanding them. If you’re unclear about something, ask a question. Overall, be curious in your interactions and avoid jumping to conclusions.If you start to doubt what the person is doing or saying, ask a question. However, don’t be accusing. For example, if your partner is going out and you’re feeling suspicious, ask, “Do you know what time you’ll be back? I was hoping we could spend some time together tonight.”

, If you generally tend to be untrusting toward people, this likely affects your ability to have friendships and relationships. While it’s true some people shouldn’t be trusted, it doesn’t mean that everyone is not trustworthy. Think about what it costs you when you doubt someone; their time, their presence, their love, and perhaps even their friendship.


For example, if someone calls and says they will be late, then it simply means they are running late and nothing more. Even if there is a pattern of lateness, it doesn't mean they're up to something else based solely on this one trait, however much you dislike it.
If you’re having a hard time believing someone, say to yourself, “I am choosing to believe they are telling me the truth.”

, Maybe an ex cheated on you and now you’re wary of dating or being with someone new for fear they may also betray you. Living in the past is not a healthy way to direct your present and future behavior. Avoid letting past bad experiences cloud your present judgment, and learn how to stop yourself from falling into automatic suspicious responses whenever a similar situation arises. Rebuilding trust starts with you, not anybody else.Learn from your past experiences and improve your resilience, but use the past like a stepping stone rather than a weight dragging you down.

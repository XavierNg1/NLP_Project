 The American Dental Association recommends using dental floss at least once every day, but especially when you know there is debris stuck between your teeth.This may also include soft debris, which can include bread. The starch will turn into sugar and bacteria will grow.


Try to work the floss as close to the gum as possible between the teeth where the popcorn is stuck.Form the floss into a c-shape around one tooth, then around the next tooth.Work the floss back and forth or up and down keeping contact with your tooth to loosen the popcorn.
Rinse your mouth out with water.;
, Take great care to avoid stabbing or otherwise injuring your gums.


Insert the flat end of a toothpick between your teeth at the site where the popcorn is lodged.Gently work the popcorn out from between your teeth, moving it either upward or forward.If this doesn't work or if the toothpick doesn't have a flat end, use a pointed end and gently work the toothpick along your gums. Use extreme caution to avoid injuring your gums or the poking the inside of your mouth.If your teeth are too crooked, then you may need to look for a strong fabric wire that can act like a floss.
 Brushing is highly effective at removing dental debris like popcorn.Wet the bristles of your toothbrush.
Toothpaste is optional for removing debris, but the foaming action may help. Squeeze out a pea-sized blob of toothpaste onto the bristles of your toothbrush.
Hold the toothbrush at a 45 degree angle to your gum.Try to work the popcorn out from between your teeth using the bristles in various strokes and movements. Once you remove the popcorn, rinse the bristles of your toothbrush to avoid reintroducing the debris into your mouth.

 In late spring, carefully lift a plant, preserving as many roots as possible. Cut the creeping rhizome into sections and discard the old center of the clump. Once it has flowered, it won't do so again.


When cutting, ensure that each section has its own fan of leaves and a growing point (bud or shoot). Make the cuts at the narrow spots where the rhizome changes growing direction.;
,, The soil should be well dug over and this plant prefers a deep, fertile, and well-drained soil. Ensure that the position has full sun.
 Place them 35cm (14") apart. They should be planted half above and half below the soil. Any deeper and there is a tendency for the rhizomes to rot.
 Orris root does not tolerate prolonged dry periods.
 Add a complete plant food when planting but there is no need to feed again. Old rotted manure or compost can be used as a mulch.
, To get the orris root for home use, lift out the orris root in autumn. Remove soil and any debris and hang them to dry in a warm place.


If you're wanting to replant some and use others, lift them out in early summer and put the younger pieces back into the soil to keep growing, while drying the rest.
The root can be dried in the sun before storing in a jar.
 The fragrance of dried orris root takes about one year to develop. Keep it in an airtight jar.

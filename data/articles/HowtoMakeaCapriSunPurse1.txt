 Take out the straws after you drink them. Rinse the juice bags thoroughly with soap and water.;
,, Put strips of duct tape on the inside seams, as shown:

,, Lay the two parts together, face down, so that their side edges are aligned with each other and touching. Tape the two sides together. You should have one long strip of bags now.
 Fold this long piece six juice bags in half, and duct tape the ends together so that the whole piece forms a ring. Do this part carefully so that the duct-taped lining doesn't show on the outside.


Flip the bag inside out, so that the inside is now on the inside.
 Press the circle of bags down so that you now have three juice bags on one side, three juice bags on the other.
 Duct tape the two parts of the purse together on the outside at the bottom.
 Cut desired lengths of duct tape for handles and fold them in half lengthwise carefully. Make sure there are no bumps. Attach them to the purse with more duct tape on the inside so that people cannot see the taped lining. Make the curved handles even in length and symmetrical when they're attached to the bag.

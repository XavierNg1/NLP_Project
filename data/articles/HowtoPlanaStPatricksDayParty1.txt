 Before you can plan the finer details of your St. Patrick’s Day part, you’ll need to decide who you want to invite. You might want to invite friends, family, neighbors, and/or coworkers.Plan on inviting about 20% more people than you can accommodate, since many people might not be able to attend.;
, Your St. Patrick’s Day invitation should include some sort of appropriate graphic. For instance, you might choose an invitation bearing a four-leaf clover or a leprechaun (a mythical creature associated with the holiday).You could buy invitations or make them at home if you have appropriate software and a color printer.
Place the invites into green envelopes and add some green confetti inside for a fun surprise when they’re opened.
Send the invites out at least two weeks prior to the party.
If your party is more spontaneous, just send out email invitations to everyone, and try to include a green graphic in the email body like a shamrock or leprechaun design.
 Let your guests know where the party will be held, what time they should arrive, and what sort of activities will be at the party. Encourage party guests to wear green and to RSVP.

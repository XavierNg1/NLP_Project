 Use a saucepan with a lid so it can be allowed to simmer later. Move your butter around while it melts to avoid burning. You can increase the amount of butter you make by adding more sticks and ground marijuana in proper proportions.


Alternately you can use a slow cooker to cook your butter and marijuana. With this method, cook for 8-24 hours stirring occasionally.
 For each stick of butter you will need at least a quarter of an ounce of ground pot. Remove the seeds, leaves, and stems and focus on the flower buds. Grind the dried flower bud in a coffee grinder or food processor. Finer grinding may be done with a mortar and pestle.


If you are a medical patient you may want to double your dose to ensure the better results with less butter., Keep the temperature at low. Stir the ground pot into your butter until it is evenly distributed. If your butter starts getting too hot, add a little water to reduce the temperature.
 Cover the top with cheeseclothfor straining. Use a rubber band around the top of the container to hold the cheesecloth in place. Pour the mixture through the cheesecloth into the container. Squeeze the solids to get as much butter out as possible. Store in an airtight container in your fridge for later use.


You may also use a wire mesh strainer.If you used less finely ground marijuana, the wire mesh will catch the large solid pieces. Squeeze the solids by pushing on them with a metal spoon to get excess butter from them.
 You can substitute the entire recipe amount with marijuana butter. If you find that you are not getting the needed medicinal effect, consider increasing the amount of marijuana per stick of butter to a half an ounce. Alternately, you can use a different method of cooking with marijuana.

 They don't call it an "introduction" for nothing. If you are writing to a college, include what school you attend and what year you are.


If you're applying to a business, name the career field or organization/employer with whom you are interested in applying to and for which quarter.

Personalize the letter. Make sure the letter of intent addresses the specific institution or organization to which it is being submitted. If it is a letter for graduate school, note why that school is the right choice for you. If it is a business proposal, highlight something that you have done which demonstrates a specific skill set that will apply to that company or organization.
 Here's where your letter starts getting good. You need to sell yourself and show adequate knowledge of the program. The next few paragraphs should be dedicated to this.


Describe why you are writing the letter. Describe how you first learned about the internship or job position and why you are excited about it. Why are you interested in it and not their competitors?
State your credentials. Don't be shy! Tell the reader why he should consider you for this school/program. Use specific examples of technical or general skills, knowledge, experience (paid or unpaid), languages, and computer software that are relevant to the field. This can be in paragraph form or a bulleted list of your accomplishments. Be specific and be honest.
Say some good things about the school/program. Flatter the reader, but do not overdo it. Describe why you find the position appealing, and how your strengths and interests would be a good fit for the position.
 Express your desire for an interview. Make sure that you include all of your contact information in the letter so you can be contacted for the interview.


You may have to follow up as well, depending on the policy of the organization. It's best to cover all your bases.

 To create your collage, you can use cutouts from magazines, fabric, or other sources as well. In the example provided, you'll use one of the prints/paintings to form the background, then cut features out from other prints/paintings to add to this background. Altogether, you'll need:


Old paintings (or prints; several)
Glue
Pliers (optional)
Screwdriver (optional)
Scissors

, Use your hands to release the fasteners holding each painting in the frame. If the fasteners are old and difficult to manipulate, you might need to use a tool, like a screwdriver to pry the fasteners open and remove the painting.


Some of your paintings may have a rigid protective backing made of cardboard or card stock. Remove this along with the painting, if necessary.
Use pliers to remove nails from paintings that are nailed into their frames. Do this by gently pulling and twisting the nails free with the pliers., The background you choose is purely a matter of taste. When deciding your background, however, think about what aspects of the other pictures you want to use, and how these might influence the end result.Unexpected combinations can really spice up peaceful paintings. For example, you might add army men or a killer robot to a pastoral scene., Take your scissors and cut out the images from other paintings that you wish to add to your background. Add a thin layer of glue to the back of the cut-outs, then stick them into place on your background.After cutting, arrange the images on the background to see how it looks before gluing.
Allow your glue to completely dry for the time indicated on its label. For many glues, this will only take a few hours.
 Slide your upcycled painting into the frame. If there is rigid backing, place this behind the painting. Close the fasteners on the back of the painting and hang your brand new, upcycled painting.

 Only put a few bratwurst in at a time. This will ensure that each wurst has enough room around it to cook thoroughly.
 Fill the dish with enough lukewarm water to cover them. This will ensure that the bratwurst don’t dry out as they are cooking. The water will boil while it’s cooking, so you want to make sure you have enough that it won’t boil away as you’re cooking.
 The microwave will cook the bratwurst very quickly, but you won’t be able to adjust the heat while they are cooking. Cook the bratwurst for 2 minutes only so that they don’t burn on one side.


Cook according to your microwave’s manufacturer instructions. Some cooking times may vary depending on the microwave.
 Use tongs to grab the bratwurst and turn them over. Space them out so they have enough room to thoroughly cook. Cook on a high setting for 2 more minutes.


Be careful, as the dish may be very hot. Use oven mitts to take the dish out of the microwave.
 Use a meat thermometer and poke into one bratwurst so that the tip of the thermometer rests in the middle of the bratwurst. It should reach 160 °F (71 °C).


Alternately, you can cut into the bratwurst with a knife to check if it’s done. If it is still pink, put it back in the microwave for one more minute on a high setting.

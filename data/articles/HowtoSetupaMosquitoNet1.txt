 Find a flat, dry area that is several yards from any open water. Self-supporting nets are like tents, so you can find a spot that you would feel comfortable setting up a tent on.If you’re inside, find a spot where you will feel the most comfortable and that has enough room for the net.;
, Remove the net, as well as any rods, strings, and stakes, from its bag. Separate the net from the other parts., Spread the net over the area you have chosen. Pull the stake loops on the ends of the tent out to the corners of your sleeping area.If your net has a base, it will be easy to tell if you have it right-side up. If not, check to make sure any zippers are on top of the net.
 The poles will be broken into small sections that are connected with an elastic rope. Connect the sections together to form the full length of the pole.If you have polls of different lengths, separate them so you don’t accidentally start to use a short poll where a long poll is needed.
 Depending on the particular net you have, there will either be fabric sleeves or clips that hold the polls in place. The polls will extend from one stake loop, over the top of the tent, and connect to the stake loop on the opposite side of the net.If you have a rectangular net, you will most likely have two long polls that cross each other in an X shape at the top of the net.
On more elaborate nets, there may be a space for a smaller poll that holds the entryway of the net up.
 Using the included stakes, or sticks if no stakes are included with the net, stake the tent to the ground by hammering the stakes into each corner of the net. There will be loops on the corner of the tent that the stakes pass through.If you’re inside, you don’t need to stake the net to the ground.
 Keep it away from the edges of the net since mosquitoes can bite through the net if your skin is touching the edges., Make sure every zipper is closed completely. Otherwise, smaller mosquitoes may be able to get through.

 A huge cause of stress is any social media, whether it be your phone or facebook account. Try to spend some time away from these things to help reduce your anxiety.


Turn off your phone or leave it in your car for a bit so that you don’t run the temptation of obsessively checking it every few minutes.
Leave your laptop closed and turn off your desktop so that you are not tempted to check your online media accounts.
If social media is a big enough stressor in your life, consider removing it entirely for a period. Deactivate your online social accounts for a few weeks or months until you feel that it will no longer cause a problem for you.
 TV is full of bright colors, busy images, and constant noise which help to raise stress levels.
 Often the people around us cause us the most anxiety, so make it a point to spend some time with just yourself.


Take time off work to catch up on rest and alone time. Try taking a weekend retreat to a local town or nature reserve where you can have some time to think.
Cancel plans with friends if you overwhelm yourself with a too-packed schedule. It is important to have time with just yourself before sharing it with others.
Find time away from your family. It doesn’t matter how much you love them, everybody needs a bit of time separate from their family in order to keep a healthy mindset.
 If you know that an upcoming test or meeting is what is causing your stress, try to spend time away from it to prevent additional anxiety.


Set firm boundaries for times in which you are willing to deal with these stressors, if they are work or school related. Promise yourself only to work on your homework until 8pm, after which you will spend time debriefing and letting go of stress.
If a certain person or activity is responsible for your anxiety, avoid them for a bit. Spend time thinking about why that thing, in particular, bothers you so much, and a solution to the problem.

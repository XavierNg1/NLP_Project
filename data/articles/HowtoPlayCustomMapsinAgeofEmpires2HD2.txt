 AoE2HD custom maps are files of the extension *.rms. These files can be downloaded from the Internet. A couple of sites from where you can get them is IGN’s File Planetor Mod DatabaseAlso, if your friends have custom maps that you would like to use, ask for a copy of the .rms files from them.
 Once you have the custom map files, move the it into the “Random” folder of your AoE2HD installation. The “Random” folder will typically be found here: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires II HD.


To access the “Random” folder on a Mac, open the Applications folder from your Dock and then open the AoE2HD folder. All resource files for the game, including the “Random” folder, are stored therein.
 Run your AoE2HD game, and on the Game Settings page on any game mode you chose (whether multiplayer or single player), choose “Custom” from under Map Style. Your custom map, which bears the name of the *.rms file you put in the Random folder, will appear in the Location drop-down menu. Select it, and click “Start Game” to play!

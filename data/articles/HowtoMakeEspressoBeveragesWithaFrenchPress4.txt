 For those who would like to use whipped cream, this is a basic recipe:


1/2 pint heavy cream, chilled
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoons powdered sugar

, Using a stick blender or whisk, whip the cream in a large bowl until soft peaks form.


It sometimes help to whip the cream and get a fluffier consistency if you use a metal bowl and whisk. Place the cream in the bowl with the whisk and let it sit in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes.
You may also want to add some sugar before you start whisking. the sugar will help the cream to clump and form.
 Continue to beat the mixture until it reaches the consistency of whipped cream.


You can place your bowl back in the fridge to cool if you are still brewing your beverage.
 While the cream is cooling in the bowl, make your espresso using the first method.


You can then finish making your whipped cream while your beverage steeps, if you haven't yet. Make sure that you've whipped your mixture so it's fluffy and not runny.
 Once you have your desired consistency, add a dollop to your beverage.


You can also stir the whipped cream into your beverage if you want more of a FrappuccinoÂ® drink.

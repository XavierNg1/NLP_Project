 Aerosols will kill some bees, but cause the rest to be confused and spread out in the wall so the problem becomes more extensive.
 If new bees come around, they need to be able to determine that the cavity is repellent, so they give up and go away. If they can't get in to where the powder is, they become more determined and will enter the wall further away, and walk along leaving the scent marker as they go. A new colony might set up just outside the range of the powder.


Also, the wall still needs to be able to ventilate itself so it doesn’t become musty. So many houses are damaged with materials such as foaming resin and silicone that have been used to block bees. This almost always encourages bees to try again.
 Many people blindly assert that feral bees should be “saved." This is not a very sensible idea. After all, bees only live about 8 weeks,and all their characteristics are fixed at birth. It takes that long for the colony to be rehabilitated with a new queen to produce more useful brood because the old bees have to die off first. It's far better to accept that to control the spread of disease, some bees have to be eliminated to protect the healthy colonies under good management.


One of these well managed colonies can easily be divided and made productive in only a week or so to make up for the loss of a bunch of ferals. It’s the same as having problems with cattle that have serious illness; you just don’t go and put them in with the healthy cows.
 Our lives depend on food crops pollinated by healthy bees. It is much better to call on an experienced person who knows what he or she is doing with bees. Accept that if there is expertise and or chemicals involved, they will need to be paid fairly, as you would pay any professional.

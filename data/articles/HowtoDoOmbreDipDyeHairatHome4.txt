 This is going to be the last bleaching process, and probably the most important bleaching step. Open up each foil.
 We already bring the color up before in the second bleaching process, but we are going to bring it up about 1.5 inches (3.8Â cm) higher. As before, make it a little messy so it looks more natural.
 You basically repeat the whole process, but don't leave this step to process as long as the first and second bleaching. Try leaving it for about 10 minutes, but check the foil every couple minutes because if it gets too light it is going to ruin the ombre hair effect. When its light enough, open your foil and be ready to rinse it off.

 Keep in mind though that not all battle fields have an MC. Knowing the location of these gravity lifts will help you in a firefight whether you are retreating or joining in.;
, If the MC is pointing off to the left, you will go left. This is the same with all other directions.
 Take Valhalla for instance. The center MC of your base (the two towers on both ends of the playing field) will take you to the center ridge (the middle of the map). On this ridge is a Spartan Laser. The first to get to the laser is most likely the guy who will get the first kill.
 On the map called Narrows, the two M.C.s (one positioned in both bases) are used to send the player to the enemy "fortress." Once done, you can proceed to massacre the hostile until then flee to safety with the second MC.
 Grenades and equipment are used with an MC to attack enemy players without your player going into the heat of battle. The preferred equipment item to 'give' to your enemy is the Power Drain. Once your enemy's shield is drained, you can proceed to pick him/her off with a scoped weapon. You can also try to send vehicles over and attack your opponents. To do this, drive a ghost or mongoose into the MC and it will hurl you across the field. As you kamikaze your way towards your opponent, be sure to have a friend ready with a Sniper Riffle in case you miss your target.

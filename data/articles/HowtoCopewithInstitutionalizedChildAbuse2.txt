 You are not a bad person, you are not weak, and you are handling this as well as you can. It is not right for adults to hurt or neglect children. Any mean words from them are not an accurate view of you as a person.
 Even if they try to control your body, they do not control your mind. It may be necessary to obey them as you seek help. Imagine yourself as an undercover agent or science fiction hero if it helps make it more bearable.
 Could you hide without getting caught? Would you be able to run away to the nearest gas station or other building to get help? Where is the nearest phone to call the police?

, Arrange a visit, call them, email them, or contact them via social networking. Explain what happened to you and how you are feeling. They may pick you up right away, and talk about involving the police to keep the other children safe too.


Unfortunately, sometimes your parents may not believe you. (This is especially likely if they are the ones who sent you to a conversion camp.) If this is the case, call the police or Child Protective Services. This is serious and you deserve help.
If your parents will not listen about abuse, and you worry they will send you back, call Child Protective Services.

 Place the divisor, the number you'll be dividing, outside the long division bar, and the dividend, the number that you'll be dividing it into, inside the long division bar. Remember that if you want to do short division, your divisor can't have more than one digit.








518 ÷ 4

, 5 ÷ 4 = 1 R1. Place the quotient, 1, above the long division bar. Write the remainder above the first number of the dividend. Place a small 1 above the 5, to remind yourself that you had a remainder of 1 when you divided 5 by 4. 518 should now look like this: 5118








, The next number is 11, using the remainder of 1 and the second number of the dividend. 11 ÷ 4 = 2 R 3, because 4 x 2 = 8 with 3 left over. Write the next remainder above the second number of the dividend. Place the 3 above the 1. The original dividend, 518, should now look like this: 51138








, The remaining number is 38 -- the remainder 3 from the previous step and the number 8 as the last term of the dividend. 38 ÷ 4 = 9 R2, because 4 x 9 = 36, which is 2 short of 38. Write "R2" at the top of the division bar.
 You can find your final answer, the quotient, at the top of the division bar. It's 518 ÷ 4 = 129 R2.

 If you’re connected to your broadband via Wi-Fi, try to connect directly using a LAN cable instead.
 Connect your computer directly to the router using the LAN cable.
 Find out if doing the previous steps has resulted in a restored connection.
 If after the direct LAN cable connection you still don’t have Internet connection, the problem isn’t with your Wi-Fi. The problem may be outside your own home or with the service provider. It can also be the router itself.

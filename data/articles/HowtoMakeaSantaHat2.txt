The color doesn't have to be red and white. You can choose other colors, such as green or royal blue. Make it festive!

, With the square of felt lying flat, first fold it into a cone shape. Bring the upper left corner over to the right lower corner. Pin the edges in place.
 The pinned edges are now on your left rather than pointing right. Fold these pinned edges to the right side. Fold this into a complete cylinder shape.
 Start cutting where the corner meets the folded red felt. This should be about 60 percent below the top point of the cone.


You will be cutting four layers in total, right corner to left, straight across.
 Take the red felt and measure that length across the bottom, starting in the lower left corner, and mark it.
 Hold the back of the white fur against the red felt material and trace the shape of the red material onto the white material. Cut approximately six inches (15cm) high, starting an inch below the traced line.
 Matching the two materials, stitch a seam, attaching the white fur to the red material.
 Pin in place inside and sew a seam. Make sure that all of the edges are aligned and stitch them together, all the way from the top of the hat to the base at the bottom.
 Use the shears to snip off extra material. Turn the hat inside-out.


Get creative! Customize the hat to a person's liking by adding their name. A fun idea is to let a child decorate it with craft supplies such as non-toxic paint and glitter glue.
Make sure the hat is thoroughly dried before wearing it; this may take a while.

 Before trying to access your work email from home, contact your company's IT department to make sure that it is allowed. Many larger companies prohibit accessing work email outside of the office for security reasons. Your IT department can also point your in the right direction for getting access to your email.;
, Depending on the Microsoft products your business is using, there are a couple of different ways you may be able to access your email from a web browser. If your company uses Office 365 for Business or has an Exchange server configured for web access, you can use Outlook Web App (Formerly Outlook Web Access) to view your work emails.
 If your company does have Outlook Web App, you can access the login page depending on how your company's email service is configured:


Office 365 for Business - Visit portal.office.com.
Exchange server - Visit the login page for your Exchange server. For example, if your company is called "Interslice," your Exchange login page may be mail.interslice.com.
 Enter your Office 365 for Business or Exchange email address and password. If you don't know these, contact your IT department.
 After logging in, you'll be able to open your account's inbox. The process is a little different depending on if you're using Office 365 for Business or an Exchange server:


Office 365 for Business - Click the app launcher button (it's grid-shaped) and select "Mail."
Exchange server - Click the "Mail" option in the navigation bar.
 Once you've opened your inbox, you can view, reply, and compose messages much like you would with other mail clients and websites. Your folders will be displayed on the left side of the screen, and your messages in the middle. Selecting a message will make it appear in the right frame.

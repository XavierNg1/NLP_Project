 The Pocket Edition is sold through Google Play, the Apple App Store, and the Amazon Store. Even if an update is available for one, it can take days or weeks for the same update to show up in another store. Visit the store that your device can access, and look for an Update button.



Connect to the internet if possible, since your phone's basic data connection may not be fast enough to download the update in a reasonable time.
 Your phone, tablet, or other device might not meet the minimum requirements to play the newest version of Minecraft. Search online for your device's technical information, and compare it to the requirements listed at the online store where you bought Minecraft Pocket Edition. Here's how to check the requirements for version 0.9.5:


The iOS version requires iOS 5.0 or later, and works on iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch.The Android version (including for Amazon Kindle) will tell you whether your device is compatible if you log into your Google account and visit this page.
 It can take several hours to download a large Minecraft update over some devices. This is especially true if you are in an area with poor internet reception.
 If you still can't update, ask for assistance from the tech support connected to the online store you bought Minecraft from, such as Google Play, the Apple App store, or the Amazon Store. You can also try asking for help from the community on the Minecraft Pocket Edition support forum, or submit a bug report.

You can buy shelves from your local bike shop or online. They range from $20 to hundred of dollars.


If you want to easily store items like bike tools, panniers and cleaning cloths along with your bike, buy a shelf with extra hooks or cubes.






If you want to display your bike inside your home like a piece of wall art, get a decorative shelf that is beautiful as well as sturdy.

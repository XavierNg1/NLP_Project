 Take a month to note down where you spend all of your money. You can use a smartphone app to help with this project, or you can rely mostly on your bank account if you don't use much cash.Separate out what you spend into categories. For instance, you can have categories such as "groceries," "gas," "clothing," "eating out," "entertainment," "rent," "bills" and "fees." You could also separate your bills into two categories: ones that are absolutely necessary, such as insurance, and ones that you may want to reduce or remove, such as cable and your phone.
 On a spreadsheet or app, identify what percentage of your money is taken up by necessary items, such as rent and bills. Also, use your last month's spending to see how much you spend on gas and groceries. Determine how much you have leftover for discretionary spending., If you are starting a new hobby, some money must come from other areas. For instance, you might want to cut down on other entertainment or stop eating out as much. Maybe you could spend less at the grocery store. How much you allocate depends on what hobby you choose, as some are more expensive than others.
 You have a number of options available to you if you need a cheaper hobby. For instance, you could read or write, take up running, or try gardening or camping.

 Don’t just start going straight into the meat of your speech. People expect a small preamble, and it’s good to get your voice working first anyways. Address the crowd and say good morning, good afternoon, whatever it may be. For example, say something like "Good morning/afternoon/night to the faculty, our trustees, and of course my classmates"

, It’s probably a good idea to address the head of the school by name. You could also address your parents, or maybe a specific teacher as a joke, or someone who helped you write the speech. This is always a good way to start a speech and it helps you warm up as you get into it.


For example "I'd like to thank my Grandparents for traveling all the way down from Alaska to be here today."

, Remember, you’re just getting started. You’ll definitely be nervous, and nerves inevitably will cause you to speak faster than you think you are. Consciously slow yourself down. Take pauses, observe the crowd. Even though it might be terrifying, understand that everyone is on your side. This is a once in a lifetime moment, but there’s no pressure! Appreciate the experience for what it is. Don’t rush.


Rushing will make your speech harder to understand and sound worse. Pauses can make a good speech sound great, speeding up can make a good speech sound awful.

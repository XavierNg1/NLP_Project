 Pluck the feathers, and skin the bird. Cut off the head and feet. Clean out the intestinal cavity.


Place the bird in a large pot of boiling water, if you have not used the other method to clean your bird. There should be enough water in the pot to keep the bird submerged, but not too much to boil over. This method will soften the feathers to allow them to be easily plucked. After boiling the bird until it's softened, cut off the head and feet and then clean out the intestinal cavity. There is not an exact boiling time, as this will be determined by the size of the turkey.;
, This will help the meat to stay tender. You can either fry or bake your wild turkey. There are a variety of wild turkey recipes available.
 The additional basting liquid will prevent the turkey from drying out, which will help tenderize the meat. An ideal baking temperature is 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Cook the turkey for approximately 15 minutes per lb., or 30 minutes per kg. The turkey is considered done when the internal temperature, which is measured with a meat thermometer at the thickest point of the bird, reaches at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsius).
 This is ideal if you don't like the idea of baking the turkey. The fat and oil from the fryer will help keep the turkey moist. Deep frying should never be done inside due to the risk of fire. Pay special attention to the oil levels, as you do not want the oil to spill out of the fryer once the turkey has been added. Cook the turkey at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) for 3 to 3.5 minutes per lb. (6 to 7 minutes per kg) or until the turkey has a golden brown color.

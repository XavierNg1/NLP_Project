 Allow your plants between one and one and a half inches of water per week. Broccoli likes moist soil.


You can use a rain gauge to see how much water the plants are getting naturally, and make up the difference with irrigation.
Make sure not to get the budding broccoli crowns wet when watering. Doing so causes them to mold.
In particularly hot or dry conditions, increase the amount of water you feed your plants.
 Use an organic, nitrogen-rich fertilizer when your broccoli plants begin to form new leaves. Fish emulsion works well for fertilizing broccoli plants. You can continue to fertilize the plants about once a week until they are ready for harvest.
 Broccoli plants have very shallow roots. If you disturb the soil you may accidentally break roots and damage your broccoli plants.


If weeds develop around the plants, suffocate them with mulch instead of plucking them from the ground to avoid disturbing the roots.If you choose not to grow organically, you can also use a chemical pesticide to remove unwanted weeds from your garden without disturbing the broccoli roots.
 You want to harvest your broccoli crowns when the buds are tightly closed and dark green. Avoid waiting until the buds begin to flower into light green or yellow flowers. Cut the crown where it meets the stem using garden shears.


See "Choosing a Variety" above for exact growing times for specific varieties.
Avoid breaking the crown off. A clean cut will better encourage new growth.
With a healthy cut, the broccoli plant should grow small shoots from the side of the stem. You can continue to harvest the small shoots, and the plant should produce more.

 A cardboard box, drawer or similar item is ideal. Some people recommend using a toy chest. Empty the box, drawer, toy chest or whatever you are making into a soft cave of all its contents and place it on the floor with the open side towards you.;
, Bathroom soft furnishings, especially rugs, make the 'best' teddy bear soft cave floors. Using anything else such as a towel, old sweater or small blanket as the floor will not create an optimal end result. Put the bathroom rug on the bottom of your cave.
 Neatly put them on top. You can put them on top of the cave or on top of the bathroom rug, which ever you think best.
 Throw for best results, don't simply place or arrange. If you have pillows in cave or stone colors, they'd be perfect.

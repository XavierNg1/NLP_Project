 A chamois leather is a cloth traditionally made from the hide of a chamois, which is a European antelope. Today, chamois leather may also be made from the hides of goats or sheep, or it may be made from synthetic, non-animal material.A chamois leather is ideal for drying off a dog quickly and easily because it is absorbent and soft.


You can purchase a chamois online directly from manufacturers or sites such as ebay or Amazon, or you can purchase one at automotive supply stores. Many people use chamois leathers to dry their cars.
The natural oils in natural chamois leather will help make your dog's coat shiny., For a dog with long fur, gently press the excess water from the dog's coat before rubbing. You can rub vigorously and quickly, but do not rub too hard.
 Wring the water out of the chamois leather periodically before continuing to press the water out of the dog's coat. Chamois leather, once wrung out, will feel almost dry and will be able to absorb water again., As you rub, be especially gentle around the dog's chest, neck, ears, and paws.

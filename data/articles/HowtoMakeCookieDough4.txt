 Use an electric mixer to beat the butter and sugar together at medium speed.


The butter and sugar should be fluffy and well-combined.
Make sure to use softened, room temperature butter when starting.
Mix the ingredients in a medium bowl.
 Add these ingredients to the butter mixture and stir with a mixing spoon until thoroughly combined.


Add the vanilla and salt to taste. Since there are no eggs in this recipe, you can add these two ingredients slowly and taste after each addition. Stop once you achieve a flavor you enjoy.
 Add the chips to the dough and mix well with a mixing spoon until evenly distributed.


At this point, the dough will still be fairly thick.
 Add cold water to the dough 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time, stirring well after each addition to incorporate it.


Continue adding water until the dough reaches standard dough consistency. If you plan to add the dough in chunks to ice cream or other desserts, use less water for a stiffer dough. For a dough you can enjoy by the spoonful, add more water.
 Since this dough is eggless, it should be enjoyed raw and is best when served immediately.


To save the dough, place it in a resealable glass or plastic container and refrigerate it for up to 1 week.

 What kind of tablet do you want to invest or spend on? This can be a variety of answers. And don't be afraid to spend a little more than you bargain for; in the end, you will most likely enjoy your tablet... a lot.


Want to do work and play at the same time? Choose the iPad.
Need to design artwork, Photoshop? Choose the Wacom brand.
Want to use a stylus with your tablet? Just go to the electronics store.
Want to just play (games, books, shopping)? Choose the iPad.;
, That will make both of them much more useful., Never buy a tablet for over $1,000 if you just intend to spend less than a couple of hours on it.
 How much storage do you plan on using? In most cases, when the storage (example: 16GB) goes up then the price goes up about $150 every time it doubles. If you're planning on having a low storage, a 16GB (gigabyte) storage is fine. If you plan on using a whole lot of storage, such as playing games or just using it for a while, try 32GB to 64GB. Having anymore than that would just cost more money, and you're probably not going to use it all.

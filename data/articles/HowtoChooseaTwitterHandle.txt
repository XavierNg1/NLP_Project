 One or two-word handle names are very easy to remember. Usernames like “@johndoe” is much easier to remember than “@misterjohnathandoe.”


Twitter also limit tweets to 140 characters at max, so if another user tweets something on your account, your handle will also use those 140 characters, leaving other users very few characters to write tweets with.;
, Think of a Twitter name that’s easy to remember even if you’ve just heard it for the first time. Putting an adjective before your name is a great way to make it sound unique and catchy to the ears.


In example: “@CoolCarlson” or “@AwesomeAnna”

, If your Twitter account’s all about food, dining, and eating, don’t use something that’s way off the relativity chart, like “@HotRod” or “@CoolCat.” Use something relevant like “@CoolChef” or “@AwesomeDining.” This way, other users can easily figure out what your tweets are about even before they start following you.
 Twitter names are not the same as email addresses. Although it’s very tempting to just put in numbers after your name, it’s really not recommended, especially if you want to make your account as unique as possible. Using “@john1000” as your Twitter name may be much easier, but expect that there are 999 other “John” users on Twitter that can be mistaken for your account.
 Unique doesn’t mean you have to be complex about it. Avoid using deep words like “breviloquence” when all you really mean is “short.” Instead of using “@impressiveconceptualizations,” why not just use “@CoolConcepts” or “@CoolIdeas.” Not only is it short and catchy, it’s simple enough for users to describe you.

 Cleaning grill grates can get messy. You should do so outside. Lay down several sheets of newspaper on a flat surface, such as your deck or garage. Then, place the grill grates on the newspaper., You should clean cast iron grill grates while they're slightly warm. Before beginning the cleaning process, turn on your grill and preheat it. When it's done preheating, you can switch the grill off and begin the cleaning process. You may want to wait a few minutes for the grates to cool off if they're very hot. Make sure to use gloves when handling the grates., Use a paint scraper and wire brush. Scrape off excess food from the grates, as well as any set in grease or debris. Make sure to get as much debris off as possible before proceeding., Use warm, soapy water to clean your grates. You can use a scrub brush or sponge for this. Wash the grill's gates down to remove any layers of grease or dirt. You should also get out any bits of food you could not remove earlier., Mix half a cup of vinegar into a large bucket of water. Use a clean sponge to rinse your grates. Make sure to get all the soap off. Keep rinsing until water from the brush runs clean. You do not want to leave soap residue on cast iron gates.

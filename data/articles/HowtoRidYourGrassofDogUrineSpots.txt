 After he finishes up, use a pet waste bag to grab any feces, and then give the grass a quick spray with a hose to diffuse the nitrogen-containing urine. If you don't have a garden hose, just use a bucket of water.;
, As natural omnivores, dogs eat high amounts of proteins, and nitrogen is the by-product of their body's protein breakdown process. Dogs better digest high-quality proteins. Since your dog uses less effort to breakdown these better proteins, he produces less nitrogen. By reducing the amount of lower-quality proteins in your dog's diet, you can reduce the amount of nitrogen he deposits in your yard.


Replace one of your dog's meals every day or every other day with high-quality canned food. The extra water in the canned food will dilute your dog's urine, and therefore reduce the potency of the nitrogen he deposits.
Leave water out all the time to encourage your dog to drink more water. Use an automatically refilling water bowl if you have a hard time remembering to refill your pet's water bowl.
 After you've started dispersing the nitrogen in your dog's urine with water, you'll notice the process not only keeps the grass from burning, but actually improves the area and surrounding grass's appearance. This accidental lawn fertilization results in a bright green, lush lawn section that still doesn't fit in with rest of the yard. Applying fertilizer to the remainder of your lawn can merge the two areas.



Water the area generously to dilute the salts that accumulated in the grass's root zone.
Pull up the dead grass and break up the soil with a small spade.
Mix equal parts, about a handful each, of potting soil, grass seed and the soil you just broke up. Put the mixture over the bare area, and lightly pack it down.
Water the packed mixture right away. Check the soil for moisture and water the area whenever the soil dries. When seedlings appear, resume normal watering.

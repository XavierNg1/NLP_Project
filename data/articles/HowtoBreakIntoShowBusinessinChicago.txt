 The cost of living is actually extremely reasonable, so your survival on a meager income is not as daunting as it may seem. Definitely invest in a good winter wardrobe, it's freezing most of the time.;
, It's going to be expensive, but there's no way around it. You never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
 Try to find pieces that not only highlight your strengths, but are a little outside the norm. Directors get tired of hearing the year's "Top 10" over and over. The same applies to songs, if you're auditioning for musicals.
 If you can't find one, tape yourself and try to direct your own performance. Practice in front of a mirror, just as you would for dance.
 You can work one day, audition the next and never have to worry about your day job interfering with your dream job.
 You can audition at least once a day. To find out where, check the Classifieds in local newspapers, hang out where actors hang out and call audition hotlines. Hotlines may charge a small fee, but it's worth it.

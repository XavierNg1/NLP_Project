 Wash your carrots if they need it. Some baby carrots are pre-washed. You can cut them in half, if you wish, or leave them whole. Dry them off a little before moving on to the next step., Place the carrots, oil, and seasonings in a plastic bag. Zip the bag up, and shake it thoroughly to coat the carrots in seasonings and oil.You can also simply mix them up in a bowl.
Use a spoonful or two of oil (olive or vegetable) per two pounds (0.9 kilograms) of carrots. Use a dash or two of each seasoning, making sure you have enough so that each carrot has some.
 Use whatever method you prefer to grill the carrots, stirring them occasionally. They'll need about 20 minutes over medium heat, and they should be fork-tender when you're done.

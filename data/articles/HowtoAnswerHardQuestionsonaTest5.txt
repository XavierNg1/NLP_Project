 If you are asked to identify the author's “purpose,” “intent” or “main idea,” try looking closely at the first sentences and the last sentences. If they seem to closely relate to each other, this is a good indication of the main idea the writer was trying to get across.Main idea questions usually contain words and phrases, such as emphasizes, focuses on, is primarily concerned with, or the essence.
 Note key words as you read, and pay attention to words or concepts that are mentioned more than once, or in great detail.Also look for words like although, but, except, unless, and yet, because these words highlight a key idea that the author believed needed to be qualified or clarified.
 Certain answers you can rule out right away, and then focus on the remaining choices.The answer is too broad in scope, or too narrow, to fit the passage. For example, if the reading concerns college students in France, an answer describing all the people of France is too broad. An answer that only pertains to female college students in France would be too narrow.
 If an answer says something that is clearly different from something the author said in the passage, you can rule that one out right away., If there are facts specified in the answer that are not included in the written passage, you can rule out this answer as well., If an answer contains a word that has the same meaning as a main idea in the text, focus on that answer first to see whether it is supported by the reading.

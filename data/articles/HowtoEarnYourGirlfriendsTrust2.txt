 Understand that some things fall beyond trust, including putting yourself into tempting situations.
 Actions like that paired with your consistency in following through with your words will help her slowly but surely develop trust in you.
 As the boyfriend of someone who has trust issues, it is not your job to fix her or her situation. Instead, it is your job to play a supportive role.Ask her for her story and listen to her fears. From a place of concern ask her: “I know you’ve been hurt before, can you share with me what exactly happened?”
Suggest that she see someone professionally or read books to help her with coping strategies and to assist her in discovering why her past plays such a huge role in the present relationship you have with her., Your girlfriend is more than likely trying just as hard as you are to get over her lack of trust, so trust her and the process. Asking her to trust you is not going to create trust. Instead, rely on patience to be your guide in helping the relationship rise above trust issues. The road to trust is a long process that will encounter setbacks and obstacles along the way. It is a slow process as well, so don’t expect an overnight turnaround in her ability to trust you more.
If it takes her a while to take down her guard for you, be understanding and patient about it. Encourage her to share more parts of herself by sharing more personal details about yourself.
 Make time for your relationship. Give her love, appreciation, and support in some form or other daily.Ask her how she is doing or about her day. When she is feeling distant or withdraws out of fear, ask her gently how you can help: space, closeness?
Treat her with soft kisses, sweet compliments, and romantic date day or date night excursions.

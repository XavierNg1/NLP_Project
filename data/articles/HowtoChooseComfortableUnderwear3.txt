 If you tend to sweat a lot or are prone to rashes or chafing, boxers allow for better airflow. For the best fit under clothing, choose a pair that has shorter, slimmer legs and a stretch-band waist.Boxers aren’t the best choice if you wear a lot of slim-fitting pants, such as suit trousers or skinny jeans.
Boxers offer little support, so be sure that’s not important to you before choosing them.
 If you have thicker thighs, underwear styles with legs, such as boxer or boxer briefs, tend to ride up during wear. That can cause rolls that show through your clothing. Instead, choose briefs to keep the extra material away from your legs., A cross between briefs and boxers, boxer briefs offer a slim fit and more support than boxers. They are especially comfortable for a larger backside because the stretch allows them to provide more coverage than briefs do so you won’t be tugging at your underwear all day.Boxer briefs are also a comfortable option if you are tall because their higher waistband doesn’t slip down beneath the waistline of your pants when you bend over.
 Boxer trunks, or hipsters, are a shorter version of boxer briefs, which usually sit at the mid- to upper-thigh. They are a comfortable option if you have a slim build because there isn’t much bunching under your clothing.If you have thicker thighs, boxer trunks aren’t usually a good option because they can ride up as you move.

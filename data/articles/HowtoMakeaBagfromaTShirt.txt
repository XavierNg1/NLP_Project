, This space will ensure that there is enough room for straps.
 Sew across the bottom to seal the base of the bag.
 Cut the gardening thread/thick thread to about the length that you'd like the bag to flow down your back––measure how long you'd like it to hang when the strap is on your shoulder.
 Measure the strap length and cut the length leaving about one inch (2.5cm) extra at each end to attach to the bag. Use a sturdy stitch and plenty of thread––the straps will take all the strain of whatever you're carrying in the bag and you don't want this to unravel or break.


Making a strap: You can use more T shirt fabric. Use a strip of fabric about 5 inches (12.5cm) in width and fold each edge to the center. Stitch down the center to create the strap, then add to the bag. Or, as shown in the image here, you can add something different from the bag material, such as leather strap or strong, wide ribbon.

 A wine glass with a nice stand is ideal, but all you will be doing is painting a swatch of chalkboard paint on the glass so your guest can write his or her name. Highball glasses are fine (you can paint a swatch along the bottom) if you don’t want to use wine glasses.


Go for a durable glass. Wine glasses can be delicate and can break easily if you don’t purchase a decent grade of glass. For this project, go for quality so that you won’t go through the effort of painting them only to have them break.






Plastic glasses can work for this project. Make sure the glasses are completely clean and free of dust and debris.;
, You will need special paint designed specifically for chalkboard creation, typically found at the local home improvement or hardware store.


Purchase paint brushes that will allow you to paint a small area and make precise strokes.






Grab painter’s tape, which will allow you to make clean and distinct lines on the glasses.
 Tear off a piece of painter’s tape and mark the area where you will paint. Create squares, rectangles or mark off the area along the base of the wine glass for painting.


Inspect the glass to ensure it is clean and the area to be painted is free of dust and debris.
 Consider applying two coats of paint, waiting an ample amount of dry time between coats. Paint evenly as you will be writing on the painted area once it’s completely dry.
 Instead of using a wine charm, provide each guest with a piece of chalk that they can use to mark their drink.

 Go with this to enjoy all the amenities of your classic luxury cruise ship, including room service, dining facilities, and spacious cabins. However, be aware that luxury ships are generally too big to actually land on Antarctica, so only decide on this if you’re content with just seeing it, rather than setting foot on it.In the meantime, enjoy lectures from experts on the continent and its wildlife to complement the breathtaking vistas., Obviously, traveling by plane isn’t what most people think of when they hear the word “cruise.” However, when travelling by boat, anticipate a two-day journey each way across the Drake Passage, which can be exceptionally rough even during mild weather. If your primary interest is actually visiting Antarctica, consider a roundtrip flight if you are prone to seasickness, phobic about rough seas, or simply pressed for time. Once there, you can stay on land or take a shorter cruise just offshore in milder seas., Choose a cruise ship that both sails to and around Antarctica while landing at points of interest along the way. Such ships hold no more than 200 passengers, which means they are small enough to “land” and allow passengers onshore. However, be aware that “landing” is a relative term, which here means that you will simply transfer to smaller inflatable craft to reach the shore, so keep in mind that you may get wet., Once you know which type of cruise you’d prefer, research the options offered by cruise operators. Expect individual cruises to vary by length and destination(s). If you’re already thinking about a trip to Antarctica, you probably have a good idea of what you hope to see and do there, so find a specific cruise that matches your interests. For example, if you love seals and penguins, make sure to book a cruise that visits South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, which both animals frequent in abundance.

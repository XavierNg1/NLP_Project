 These exams are definitely not a walk in the park. The IB is hard for most people (even geniuses like us) so prepare for it! And when — not if, when — you pass your exams, smile and be thankful that it's over. Help the first year students.
 Work through as many past I.B exams as you can possibly handle! The questions in your textbook or those which you are completing in class may be drastically easier than the actual exam.

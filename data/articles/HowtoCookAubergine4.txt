 Put it on medium heat with a grill rack on top. If you’re using a charcoal grill, get the coals going nice and hot.


Make sure your grill is clean before you use it. Put some vegetable oil on a paper towel and wipe down the grate, one by one. Using oil can also help to prevent sticking.
 You can also halve small aubergines lengthwise instead of slicing vertically. Brush slices on all sides generously with olive oil, melted butter, or cooking oil. This adds flavor and keeps them from sticking to the grill rack, too.


Alternatively, you can grill eggplant whole or sliced in half over a medium to hot flame for 15 to 20 minutes until the skin is blackened. Pierce the skin when cooking aubergines this way to get heat into the center.
 You can also brush the aubergine with oil-based marinade instead of the oil or butter. Any marinade that works on other vegetables will work on aubergine, too.
 If you’re working with small slices, lining the grill with foil will be best to keep the slices from falling through the grate. It also keeps the oil on top and redistributable.


Pierce a few holes into the foil to allow the heat to transfer more quickly.
 For both a charcoal and gas grill, place the aubergine on a rack directly above the heat. A gas grill should be covered; a charcoal grill should not.


When finished, turn off the heat, leave the foil, and transfer the aubergine to a plate. Give both the aubergine and the foil a few minutes to cool down before either are touched.
The aubergine is now good to be added to a salad or a stir fry, or even eaten alone with your dipping sauce of choice. It can even be kept for later as part of a soup or stew.

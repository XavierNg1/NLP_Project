 If kids are coming with you, have them at your side at all times. Children get lost very, very easily at these things and your child/children getting lost can be a very traumatic experience. But if you do get lost, make sure you report it to one of the festival tents; these should be located in several places around the grounds. Also, a good tip is to write your mobile/cell phone number on your child's arm so if someone can ring you if they find your child.

 Mac OS X will unpack a .gz, .tar, .tar.gz, or a .zip file automatically.
 In your Utilities folder, find the Terminal application and launch it.


Change the directory to where your .gz file currently resides. If you saved it to the Desktop, for example, enter at the Enter gunzip -d and the name of the file, including the extension. This will extract and overwrite the .gz file, so consider making a copy of the compressed file before unzipping.

Note: there are other commands in addition to -d that you can use. They are listed below in Tips.
 There are many free or inexpensive utilities for the Mac. We'll use GUI Tar as an example.


Download GUI Tar from MacUpdate.com. GUI Tar Extractor makes it easy to uncompress and extract files from archives. The following files can be opened by Extractor: .7z, .tar, .tgz, .tar.gz, .dmg.gz, .svgz, .gz, .tar.z, .z, .Z, .tar.Z, .taz, .tbz, .tbz2, .bz, .bz2, .rar, and .zip.
Launch the GUI Tar application, and press the Extractor button
Select your file, and click Extract. Your file will be extracted into the same folder as the original file, deleting the .gz file.

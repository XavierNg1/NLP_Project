 Sheets can be folded until layers are 48 pieces thick to save time.
 Cut out the circles through all the sheets. You will be left with stacks of 48 paper circles. (Note: Less paper can be used to make fewer flowers).
 Secure the pieces with a paper clip and puncture two holes in the center with a sharp point, such as a large sewing needle.
 After pushing it through one hole, curve it and push it back out the other hole to form a loop that secures the paper. The pipe cleaner will also serve as the stem.
 Gently pull each sheet toward the center of the flower and firmly crinkle the base of each piece to hold the flower shape.

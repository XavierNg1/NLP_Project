 Brush or comb out any knots. Wash your hair, and continue on to the next step while it's still wet.
 Use an old cotton T-shirt instead if you have fragile hair.
 Bend forward, concentrating all of your hair onto one place at the top of your head. Touch the top of your hair to the towel.
 Gather the towel on your left and right and twist inward. Keep twisting until all your hair is twisted in the bundle.
 Once finished, the top and bottom edges of the towel should be compressed against your forehead and the back of your head. Your hair should sit in a pile on top of your head, underneath the towel.
 Make sure your two "towel pigtails" stay twisted. Wrap them around each other at the base of your neck or your forehead, whichever you find comfortable. Secure them in place with a hair clip, or by tying them in a knot.
 Sleep with the towel over your hair. Remove the towel in the morning and watch those gorgeous locks tumble down!

 Open your inventory by pressing Start and selecting “Inventory.” Make sure you have the items you need to create a new piece of armor. You will typically need some ingots, a “style” gem, and a “trait” gem (if you wish to add a researched trait)., You will see it as a black anvil with the words “Blacksmithing station” over it when you look at it., Select the station with the A button, and a list of blacksmithing options will appear on the screen.,

You can select whether you want to make an armor or weapon by cycling the right and left bumpers.
 Look at the four boxes on the screen from top to bottom. The first box is where you select the type of weapon or armor you want to make. Cycle through it with the left and right keys until you find the piece that you want to create., Select the appropriate ingot from the box below the type of weapon or armor. Scroll through using left and right until you find the type you would like to use., Every race has its own style of weapon, so you’ll need to pick the appropriate material for the right style. For example, Khajit uses the moonstone as their style gem., You can research traits, such as Durability, and then put those traits into weapons you want to make. Every trait has a special gem that it uses. For example, the Charged trait requires 1 Amethyst., Hit the A button and your weapon or armor will be created and placed in your inventory. Once you create the weapon or armor, you will see your blacksmithing experience increase.

 Feel around pipes and seals attached to the toilet and sinks in your bathroom for leaks. Make sure to do this regularly, because time makes all the difference when trying to prevent mold growth.If leaks are present, contact a plumber to repair them or take matters into your own hands by fixing them yourself.
 Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, washcloths and similar items can give mold a potential place to hide.Wipe these items dry or squeeze all of the water out after each use and store them in a towel closet or somewhere else dry between showers.
 After each shower, go over the walls of the shower in a vertical swiping motion with a squeegee so that you can quickly and easily get leftover water into the drain instead of allowing it to cling to the walls. Keeping shower walls dry contributes greatly to creating a low level of moisture in the bathroom., Apply a standard grout sealer to the spaces between your bathroom tiles each year to waterproof them.If at any point you have a particularly difficult time keeping your grout mold-free, you can also scrub it with bleach and a toothbrush or replace it completely by scraping it out with a flat screwdriver.

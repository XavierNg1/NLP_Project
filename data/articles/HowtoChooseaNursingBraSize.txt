 Non-breathable materials will trap moisture next to the breast and encourage bacterial growth and soreness.



Avoid bras that expose the breast entirely when opened, especially if you will need to feed the baby in public occasionally. These types of bras make it difficult to be discreet, although they may be used in private without much difficulty.
 Wait, however, until you find a style that is entirely comfortable and convenient for you to use.



Avoid bras with underwire unless you absolutely must have the extra support. Underwire bras can block the milk ducts in the breast, cause the milk ducts to become infected, and lead to mastitis.

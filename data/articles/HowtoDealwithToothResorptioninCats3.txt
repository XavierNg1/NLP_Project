 If your cat has to have their teeth removed or filed because they have teeth resorption, you should feed them only soft food for a while. Your vet will tell you the best type of food for your cat and how long they should stick to that diet., Some vets may prescribe medication for your cat post-surgery. If your vet does prescribe meds, make sure you carefully follow the directions that come with the medication.
 If your cat needs to have surgery for tooth resorption, try to prevent them from playing too rough in the weeks after their procedure. You can do this by putting away any toys that get them too riled up and playing with them more gently. Avoid letting them chase or jump to catch toys.
 Most cats who experience teeth resorption once are likely to experience it again. Schedule dental cleanings and check-ups for your cat every six months to make sure their teeth are okay.

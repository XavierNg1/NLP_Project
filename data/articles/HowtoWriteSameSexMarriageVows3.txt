 Of course, your wedding is an important day, and you're making an important promise. However, it's okay to make your vows personal, even a little silly, to help you let the other person know how much you care about them.For example, you can promise that "I'll always walk in the rain and splash in puddles with you."
You could also say that "I promise I'll always ask you to dance when our favorite song comes on the radio, even in the middle of a restaurant."

, Marriage vows take time. They come from the heart, and sometimes figuring out exactly what you want to say to the person you love on your wedding day is a daunting task. If you start the night before the wedding, you won't have time to really figure out what you want to say.Start writing your vows at least a month in advance and have a solid draft at least 2 weeks before the wedding. That way, you'll have time to make tweaks.
Practice saying your vows to friends and family to ease the stress during the ceremony. You'll feel more confident and less nervous if you've practiced them beforehand.
 You probably want to memorize your vows, but it's okay to have a backup in case you forget. Give a copy to one of your wedding attendants, so they can have it ready in case you stumble. It's a big day, and you're sure to be a big bundle of nerves. It's okay if you forget a little, as long as the sentiment is there.

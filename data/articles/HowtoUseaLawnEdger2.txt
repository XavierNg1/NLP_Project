 To create a new planting bed, you first need to decide where to put it.


Make sure you aren't going to be digging where there are power or water lines or where there needs to be manhole access to sewer pipes.
It’s best not to site a plant bed in a marshy area where puddles form and don’t easily drain away after rain. If you have this poor drainage issue, you’ll just need to improve the soil or raise the bed before putting a bed there.
 Mark out where you want your bed to go using string and pegs (this is best for square or oblong beds), chalk, or a spray can of paint.


Use your lawn edger to define the edges of the bed and make it easy to start digging it up. Start on the outside of the area you have marked.
Following the instructions provided in the section above for using your edging tool, use your lawn edger to define the edges of the new bed.
 Once you've cut and made visible one full line of the bed’s edge, return to the start of your turf cut. Now you want to make another cut about one inch inside the area of the new bed.


Make the second cut at a slight angle towards the first cut you made. The idea is to make a thin strip of turf for easy removal.
 Once you have cut the whole length, get down on your knees.


If you've made a severing cut through the turf, you should be able to pull up the long one inch wide strip of turf easily.
Now take a spade and remove the remaining turf from inside the new bed area. You’ll need to dig over and improve the soil ahead of planting.

 Purchase a day planner that allows you to write down your assignments. Write down assignments as soon as they are mentioned in class. Write down all details, including the due date, page numbers, and requirements for the assignment. Review your planner every day before you sit down for your daily homework time., Don’t wait until the last second to finish big assignments. Set goals in your planner, like when you want to complete research, an outline, and a draft of your paper. Try to arrange your schedule so that you complete drafts for papers several days before they are due. That way, you can go back and edit them with fresh eyes. The stress of completing a paper at the last second can also be debilitating.


Sometimes we procrastinate because we are afraid of failure. You need to conquer these fears. Even great writers have terrible first drafts. The process of editing is how bad writing becomes good. If you are too afraid of failure to start early, failure is precisely what you will get.
If procrastination is a problem, consider creating a designated work space, free of distractions. Leave your books and other work material around. If your environment is telling you to work, your brain might just get the message., So that you don’t lose your assignments, keep a separate homework binder for all of your completed assignments. Keep notes and other course materials in their own binders for their respective subjects.

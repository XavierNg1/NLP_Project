 The Angerthas ("long rune rows") Daeron, also known as the Angerthas Eregion, was used for Sindarin. However, by this time, the Sindar had been introduced to the Tengwar. The Angerthas Daeron was mainly used in places where the Tengwar were inappropriate (such as carvings - the Tengwar had curved shapes, making them harder to carve)., The Angerthas Daeron has many more runes than the previous Cirth forms, so it may be a bit trickier to learn.

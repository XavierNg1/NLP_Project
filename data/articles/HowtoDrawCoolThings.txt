 It may seem elementary, but basic shapes are critical to developing the skill you need to succeed at drawing.;
, This is another simple shape, but this time you'll be adding craters and shadows to provide texture to your picture.
 Although this step departs from the more realistic boundaries you've been working with so far, you should know how to employ a little suspension of disbelief when drawing, in order to make your art as fantastical as possible.
 The shapes themselves shouldn't be too difficult, but making them proportional and positioning them so they work together will take some effort.
 A snowflake like this is made up of many straight lines and exact angles, which should be a slightly bigger challenge for you.
 While the previous shapes were all symmetrical, these crystals are notâ€”you'll have to figure out how to work with that.
 These will help you get a sense of objects in motion, and what it looks like to capture that motion in a single frame.
 Unlike the explosions, however, this will be a more frenzied motion that you have to attempt to draw. Do so by surrounding your tornado shape with short, round lines, as shown.
 You're ready to draw a recognizable international monument. Use short lines, careful shading, and photographic references to get it exactly right.
 There are several ways to do this, but the point is that you'll be incorporating almost all of the techniques you've learned so far: three-dimensional shapes, shading, coloring, etc.

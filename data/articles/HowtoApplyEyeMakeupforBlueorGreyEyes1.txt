 Bring out the blue in your irises by choosing eyeshadow colors with subtle or bold orange tones present in them. This could be any eyeshadow in bronze, copper, gold, terra cotta, orange, brown, peach, or salmon.


Makeup with orange tones work well with blue eyes because orange is the contrasting color of blue on a color wheel. The contrast makes the blue “pop” and appear more vivid.In general, use at least three shades of the same hue of eyeshadow to create a blended gradient on your eyelids that goes from lightest in the inner corner to darkest in the outer corner.
These colors can also be used as eyeliner for the top or bottom lash line by applying an eyeliner pencil in the same hue, or using eyeshadow on a thin brush to create a line.;
, Use purple tones for eyeshadows to complement blue eyes. While purple shades won’t provide as much contrast for blues as orange tones do, they offer a subtle accentuation to the color.


If you don’t want to use bright purples as your main eye shadow color, try using amethyst and royal purple shades as eyeliner for a smaller pop of color.A dark plum that is almost black is also a great color for lining the eyes that is a slightly more neutral and understated way to bring in some color.
 Opt for a warmer smoky eye with brown shades rather than cool black and grey, as this can drown out your blue eye color. Use browns, golds, and light pinks for eyeshadow.








A typical smoky eye is achieved by first applying a light shadow across the eyelid. In this case, a taupe or gold color would be great. Then apply a dark brown to the outer “V” of the eye, just above the crease and down along the lash line. Blend together with a soft brush and add a little light pink to the inner corner and brow bone.
You can also use a dark brown eyeliner or even brown mascara instead of black for this look. This keeps all the eye makeup on a warm, softer palette that will not detract from the blue of your eyes.

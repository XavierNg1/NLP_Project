 Measuring correlation is a fairly standard calculation for statisticians. The calculation can become very tedious if done by hand for large data sets. As a result, many sources have made correlation calculators available online. Use any search engine and enter the search term “correlation calculator.”
, Carefully review the instructions on the website so you will enter your data properly. It is important that your data pairs are kept in order, or you will generate an incorrect correlation result. Different websites use different formats to enter data.

For example, at the website http://ncalculators.com/statistics/correlation-coefficient-calculator.htm, you will find one horizontal box for entering x-values and a second horizontal box for entering y-values. You enter your terms, separated only by commas. Thus, the x-data set that was calculated earlier in this article should be entered as 1,2,4,5. The y-data set should be 1,3,5,7.

At another site, http://www.alcula.com/calculators/statistics/correlation-coefficient/, you can enter data either horizontally or vertically, as long as you keep the data points in order. 


, These calculation sites are popular because, after you enter your data, you generally need only to click on the button that says “Calculate,” and the result will appear automatically.

 Stuffing only needs to be done when you’re weathering an object that may lose shape, such as a shoe or bag. Fill the item completely with old newspaper. Lay other leather objects flat on a table., Get some rubbing alcohol from the self-care section at a drugstore or general store. Load the alcohol into a spray bottle and lightly coat the leather. The leather should be damp, not soaked.If you don’t have a spray bottle, use an old toothbrush to spread the rubbing alcohol.
Acetone also works. It may help remove dye, but acetone can be dangerous and you may need a lot of it., Use the brush on the areas you wish to weather. To get the most authentic look, give extra attention to exposed areas like seams, edges, elbows on jackets, straps on bags, and heels on shoes. Do this while the leather is damp with rubbing alcohol to speed up aging.Any abrasive object, such as pumice stones or sandpaper, can be used. Sandpaper is very abrasive, so use it as a last resort.
 Once the rubbing alcohol is dry, apply shoe wax to give the leather protection You can use your finger, a cloth, or an old toothbrush to spread the wax over the leather. Work in as much wax as possible and wipe off the excess. Finish by buffing the leather with a brush.

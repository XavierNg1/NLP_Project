 Cut out small strips of fabric. Glue them onto your eggs to create stripes and other patterns. You can also use stencils to cut fabric into small shapes and glue to your eggs. If you want, try covering the entire egg in a Easter-patterned fabric., Take bakers twine and hot glue one end to the bottom of the egg. Wrap the twine around the egg, pausing now and then to hot glue a small strip down to keep it in place. Keep wrapping the twine around the egg until you reach the other end. Cut the twine with a pair of scissors and secure the other end with bakers twine., Glue a button on the bottom of the egg so it sits flat on the ground. Discard the top of the egg. Attach a ribbon in a loop to the side of the egg, so it looks like a little handle. You will be left with cute plastic teacups.If you want, you can decorate your teacup using paint, glitter, or markers.
 Cut pieces of orange or yellow felt into the shapes of bird wings. Cut another piece of felt into a small triangle to use as the beak. Hot glue the wings on either side of the egg. Hot glue the beak towards the center of the egg. Then, use a permanent marker to draw two eyes on your bird.If you want, you can attach a ribbon or string to your birds so you can hang them in your home.
 Cut out pieces of a cardboard egg container, cutting them into shapes of cracked egg shells. At one shell to the top of your egg and one shell to the bottom. Glue on googly eyes and felt or cardboard beaks. You will be left with what looks like chicks emerging from their eggs.It's best to use yellow plastic eggs for this project.

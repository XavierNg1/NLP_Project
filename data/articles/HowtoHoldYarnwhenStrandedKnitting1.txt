 One common method of holding your yarn while stranded knitting is to loop the strands over your non-dominant finger so that you can easily choose the strand that you want to use.The downside of this option is that your strands may get tangled from time to time, or they may slip off of your finger.;
, If you are concerned about your strands getting tangled or about getting mixed up and choosing the wrong one, then you can always hold one (or more) strand in each hand to keep them separated. Hold the yarn you are currently using in your non-dominant hand so that it will be easier to pick up., Another option for holding your yarn while stranded knitting is to use multiple fingers of the same hand to manage multiple strands. For example, you can loop one color over your index finger and another color over your middle finger.This option works best if you only have two colors that you are working with because you will need your ring and pinky fingers to grip the knitting needle.
 You can also let the strands that you are not currently working with hang freely behind your work. Letting the strands hang means that you will frequently be stopping to switch strands, which can slow you down.However, this may be a good option if you do not have to switch strands too often, or if you are just learning how to do stranded knitting.

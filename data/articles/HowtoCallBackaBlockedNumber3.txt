 If your iPhone has an iOS greater than 8, you can block any number or contact. Open the "Phone" app and tap the circular symbol with a lowercase "i" to open your contact's information. Swipe to the bottom and there should be an option to "Block this Caller". Tap to block the contact.


Manage your blocked contacts by going into "Settings" > "Phone" > "Blocked". From there, you can add more people to block or tap "Edit" to remove them from your list of blocked callers.
 There are several ways to block calls on an Android device. The easiest way is to open the "Phone" app and go to the keypad screen. Tap the three dot icon, select "Settings", and tap "Call". On the next screen, tap "Call Rejection".


Tap "Auto reject mode" to activate blocking for all calls on your reject list.
If you don't have a list of blocked calls already, tap on "Auto reject list" to input these phone numbers.
 Activate call blocking by swiping to your "Start Screen" and selecting "Settings". Tap on "call+SMS filter" and enable "Block call+SMS" so the bar is green.


Block specific contacts by going to your call list to find the number you want to block. Press and hold the number for a couple of seconds until a small menu appears. Select the "Block Contact" option.
Manage your blocked numbers by going to "Settings" > "call+SMS filter" > "blocked contacts".

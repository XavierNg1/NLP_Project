 Massage your scalp with warm coconut or castor oil twice a week. Leave it overnight and shampoo the following morning with a natural sulfate free shampoo. Massaging the scalp stimulates growth which can lead to potential hair growth.
 Brushing wet hair is a big no no when it comes to hair. Never use a brush on wet hair as it will only tear it out. Instead use wide toothed comb, make sure to comb your hair from bottom to top not top to bottom.
 Purchase products from a local drugstore to help with your lice. Visit a doctor you trust if the problem gets worse. Use home remedies such as applying the juice of basil leaves to your hair, leave overnight, and then wash off.

Kies is a Samsung software catered especially for their mobile device users. Make sure your device is running the official Samsung ROM (if you don’t know what a ROM is, you can assured), as Kies specializes in backing up the data from the official Samsung apps such as Contacts, Messages, Gallery, and more.;
, You will see a couple of versions available for download. Click the link for version 3 if you have a device running Android 4.3 or later, and version 2.6 for devices released before September 2013.


If you’re uncertain of your Android version, go to Settings > About Phone/Device > Android Version on your Samsung Galaxy.
 Once you’ve clicked the version of Kies for your device, wait for the download to finish, and install Kies by clicking the download at the bottom of your browser window.


Since default settings are enough for your purposes, just keep hitting “Next” until the installation finishes.
 Open Kies by double-clicking its icon in your desktop.
 Do this by plugging it in with the USB cord provided in your device’s packaging.


Kies should detect the device, indicated by the Connecting animation on the first row in the left panel, and you can click the device name when it finishes detecting.
 You will see some tabs in the main panel of Kies. Click on the “Backup/Restore” tab.


Here, you will be able to select the data you wish to backup. Simply tick the boxes to the left of the items (Contacts, Schedule, etc.).
Once you’ve selected the data you want to backup, click the “Back up” button in the bottom of the backup section.
Kies should begin backing up the data you select. Please do not disconnect your device while Kies is doing so. It should take a few moments, depending on whether you selected media items like Photos and Songs, so leave your device while it is backing up to prevent failure.

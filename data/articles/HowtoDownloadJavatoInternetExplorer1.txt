 Java is a computer programming language developed by Oracle that is widely used on the internet and in a variety of devices. Many websites will not function properly without the latest version of Java installed on your system.;
, For the average user, Java occurs only in the background. Installing Java allows you to run Java scripts in webpages. Most browsers will ask you if you want to run the Java scripts that are on the page you are visiting. This is because java can be used for malicious reasons. You should only run Java programs from websites that you trust.
 Oracle regularly updates Java with stability and security fixes. These updates keep your Java installation running smooth, and also protect your computer against possible malicious activity.

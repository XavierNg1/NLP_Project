 Your backpack, work bag, or purse is likely to be the place you store the belongings you use most often. After all, you carry it with you most of the day, so it must be storing the important items. That being said, most people have a way of stuffing items in there and gradually accumulating junk. So start by emptying the bag out, completely. Dump everything out on the floor, bed or table and go through all the items one by one. Throw out the trash, put away anything that can be stored at home instead of your bag, and make a pile of only what you really need.;
, Being organized and being clean go hand in hand; you probably don't want to stick your hand in your bag and end up covered with sticky old juice or crumbs or something similar. Clean your bag, and wipe down the items you're storing in it, if anything's become dirty over time.
 Chances are you have some main, big, important items to store in your bag: your notebooks or textbooks, a computer, or your wallet. Make sure that gets its "home" first.
 If you've got secondary pockets for other items, that's even better. Slot pens in where they fit, put personal items in their own small pocket, store any valuables somewhere they're not easily found if someone comes across your bag, and so on. If you've got anything that might leak (water bottles, soda bottles, lip gloss, moisturizer, etc), try to store it by itself in its own pocket so that nothing else gets damaged.
 Once you've got a system going, try to stick to it. Don't jam trash in there even when you're busy; throw it out, instead. Clean out your bag every week or so to make sure it stays organized and clean.

Many people choose to bring their dogs with them on car trips. This is fine, provided that your dog is properly secured in the car. It is safest to place the dog in a dog carrier or portable kennel that is large enough for them to turn around and lie down in. There are also varieties of seatbelt-like harnesses that you can use to secure your dog to a seat. There may be laws about how to transport a dog in a car depending on where you are travelling.



You may never need them, but having the dog's immunization records with you might prove helpful if the dog is in an accident or if it gets into a fight. Some dog-friendly hotels may also ask to see the dog's immunization records.

 You frost cookies and cupcakes, so why not frost your brownies? You can whip up some homemade frosting or buy a tub of store-bought frosting. With vanilla frosting and a little food coloring, you can even create colorful brownies with designs.


Frosting is a perfect way to transform normal brownies into festive brownies for any occasion. Write “Happy Birthday” or “Congratulations!” on a pan of brownies, and they’re instantly more special.
Experiment with different kinds of frostings to find your favorite. Try decadent frostings like German chocolate or cream cheese frosting. Add a bit of fruitiness to your brownies with a raspberry frosting. Add lemon, lavender, or honey to a vanilla buttercream frosting to create all sorts of brownies.
 Chocolate and fruit are a traditional dessert combination, after all. Top your brownies with your frosting of choice, and cut them into squares. Then, top each one with a raspberry, a strawberry slice, or whatever fruit you want to use. The culinary combination is great, and the box mix brownies immediately look more sophisticated., Anything you used as a mix-in can be used as a topping as well! While the brownies are still warm, top them with crushed candy, nuts, mini marshmallows, or any other sweet or crunchy treat. As the brownies cool, the toppings will meld to the tops, so they won't be messy. This is great for easily adding color or texture to your brownies.
 As soon as you pull your brownies out of the oven, toss a layer of your favorite chips on top. You can use dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate, or even peanut butter chips. The warmth from your brownies will melt the chips to the surface of your fresh brownies. When the chips are soft, you can spread them along the surface of the brownies with a knife or leave them as they are. Enjoy!

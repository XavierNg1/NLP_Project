 To prevent burning, you want to be able to add everything right when it is needed. The only way to do this is to pre-measure your ingredients.


The amount of sugar, anywhere between 1/4-1/2 cups (60-125ml), is up to your personal taste. For beginners, it's not a bad to split the difference and use 1/3 cups (80ml) sugar.;
, Put the burner on medium-high heat and cover while it warms. Once one of these three kernels pops you'll be ready to make your popcorn.
 As you do, keep an ear out for your test kernels to pop -- this is your indication to start cooking.
 This is your clue that the oil is the perfect temperature. Note that you only need to wait for the first kernel to pop -- don't worry so much about the other two.
 The hot oil is only half of the cooking equation -- you also need the steam to help pop your corn. Mix everything up so the sugar and oil are well-distributed around the kernels and then replace the lid., Early on this should only be occasional -- every 15-20 seconds or so. Use a potholder to hold the lid down snugly without burning your hands., As the pops become more vigorous, start shaking the pan more and more frequently, occasionally placing it back on the heat for a few seconds to stay hot.
 If the interval between pops has dropped to the point where there's only one pop every few seconds, cut the heat. Your popcorn is done.


While you'll always have unpopped kernels, waiting too long in an attempt to pop them all will lead to burnt kettle corn.
This whole process, in general, should only take 2-3 minutes., The hot pot's residual heat will cook and burn the popcorn if left in for too long. Sprinkle it out on the baking sheet and spread so that you only have one layer, helping the popcorn cool evenly.


Spreading it out helps the popcorn dry as it cools instead of becoming soggy.

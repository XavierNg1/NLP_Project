 Check that the material it is made of is non-toxic and won't break up when chewed. Choose an item that is small and lightweight enough to be used as jewelry. If the toy is for a child, be sure that the item is not small enough to be swallowed. Many types of rubber, plastic, and stones like amber can be safely chewed.;
, There are many types of string, ribbon, and chain that can be used as jewelry. When choosing a holder, check that it is non-toxic and will not fray or break when chewed. The texture of the holder is just as important as the chewable object. Some people might prefer a silky ribbon, while others will want a clunky chain. Feel free to test out different materials.
 You can attach the item by drilling a small hole and threading the string or chain through it. You can also use a wire cage hanging from a necklace or bracelet to have an easily removable chewable. Another option is to use a knotting method to form a tiny net around your object.
 Decide whether you want a necklace, bracelet, anklet, or some other item. If you are using chain, you will need to learn how to change the length of a jewelry chain and how to add clasps to the ends. If you are using string or ribbon, you can simply cut the ends to the length you want and then tie them together using a square knot.

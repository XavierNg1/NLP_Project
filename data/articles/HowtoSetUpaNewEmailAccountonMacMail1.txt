 Click the Mail icon in your dock, which is the postage stamp with the bird on it. This should open up Mail on your computer.;
, The first thing you will see upon first opening Mail will be a list of common accounts that you can set automatically. You can choose between iCloud, Microsoft Exchange, Google, Yahoo!, AOL and Add Other Email Account. Choose one mail account to initiate automatic setup.


Hit “Continue” when you’re done.
 You will be taken to a Sign In box where you enter your email details like Name, Email Address, and Password for that email address. Key in the info, and click “Set up.”

, The next page will ask you which services you want to use with that email account. The list will have services (like Calendar, Contacts, Messages, and Notes) that are compatible with your email account, and you can simply tick the boxes if you want Mac Mail to import those services over.
 Once you have made your choice, click “Done,” and you will be taken to the application window. At first, the application will not populate, but changing to a different screen or reopening the application will make the application populate.

 It is best to put on sunscreen every hour, you will get a nice tan without burning. To help you remember, you could set a timer on your phone. Apply sunscreen as soon as you get there. Use your Sun Screen as directed on the packaging. Sand and water can make Sun Screen less effective. Be sure to consider this. Obviously, the beach isn't exclusively a hot weather destination. You can skip the sun block if it's the middle of winter, unless you live somewhere that has high levels of UV Sun light all year round.;
, Having the sun constantly shining down on your head can make you feel really ill and lead to heat stroke or sun stroke. Again, not required on a cold, but sunny, bracing winter beach walk.


Be sure to buy waterproof sunscreen if there is any chance that you will enter the sea.
 If you're all planning on having a picnic at the beach, you need to keep you and your drinks and food cool. Use a cool box or chilly-bin to keep your food and drink cool and help avoid food poisoning.

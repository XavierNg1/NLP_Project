 With black dry erase marker, color in the tab so that it appears to be opened. You want to give the illusion that the tab of the can has been opened. Any other easily removable ink is also a good choice.


The black coloring on the tab will be wiped away as part of the act, so make sure the ink can be wiped away quickly and easily.
Markers labeled with a "W" denote they are water washable, and will more easily be removed from the can.
Paint pens are also widely available and can easily be removed, depending on when they were applied to the can.;
, Using a tack, needle, or other pointed object, punch a small hole in the can. Drain the soda through the small hole until roughly half of the contents remain.The soda will naturally drain to below wherever you placed the hole, so make sure you place the hole high enough to properly pour out the can when performing the trick.
If you place the hole too low, position the can such that the can does not leak when you get ready for the trick.
 Give the can a used, beat-up look by slightly crushing the sides of the can. Make sure you can crush the sides without soda draining out of the hole.


Donâ€™t crush the can too hard, as this can make restoring the can more difficult.
 Put the can somewhere that gives the appearance that it has been used and emptied. The trash bin is a good spot, but the recycling bin or simply laying around in a messy room is a good idea as well.


Make sure to place the can down so that the remainder of the soda does not leak out through the hole you created.
The soda should stay carbonated for a long period of time, provided the can is not jostled or moved too much prior to performance.

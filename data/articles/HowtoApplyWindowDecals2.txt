 Take the decal and slowly remove the white paper back from the sticker and clear plastic transfer tape. The white paper should come off without any sticking.








If the white paper sticks to the sticker decal, replace the white paper carefully. Use the credit card again to remove any air bubbles.
 Position the decal exactly how you want it on the window. If there is a specific place you want the decal, you may want to mark the top edge or middle with tape before trying to place it. That will help you get the right spot.








Slowly and carefully place the decal on the window. Use the credit card or other object to rub over the transfer tape to securely adhere the decal to the window.
 Leave the decal on the window with the transfer tape still attached for around 24 hours. This helps ensure that the decal sticks fully to the window. If you don't let the decal set, it may not adhere to the window as strongly.
 Carefully take one corner of the clear transfer tape. Slowly remove the tape, making sure to peel it at an angle from the corner. Use gentle pressure so you donâ€™t remove the decal.








If you remove the decal, reapply it to the window.

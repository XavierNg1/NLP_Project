 A toolbar acts as a folder and you are able to choose from presets or a specified folder of your choice. Right click on an empty space on the taskbar then click on “Toolbars.” Select one of the presets or choose “New toolbar” to browse for a folder on your computer. Browse for a folder you would like to convert into a Toolbar then click on “Select Folder.”There are also specialty toolbars including the address bar. The Address toolbar acts as a shortcut for opening your default web browser and allows you to type in a URL then press ↵ Enter to open your desired web address.

 This wrapping method gives you a wonton that looks a little like a grocery bag with its handles stretched tight. Begin in the same way as you did for the method above. Lay your wrapper down flat in your work area and add about one teaspoon of filling in the very center.
 Next, grab one of the wrapper's corners and fold it over your ball of filling. The tip of the corner should be at (or even slightly past) the center of the wonton. Moisten the top of this corner of the wrapper with warm water after you've folded it.


You don't need to moisten the corner's bottom edge. It will naturally adhere to the filling somewhat, but even this isn't essential for a wonton that holds together.
 Next, grab the corner that's opposite the one you just folded - in other words, the corner diagonally across from it. Take this corner and gently fold it over the top of the filling and the other corner. The tips of the two corners should overlap slightly.


When you fold this second corner over the top, it should gently adhere to the corner underneath because of the water you used to moisten it.
 Next, you'll need to fold the two remaining corners (the other set of diagonal opposites) together. Moisten one (not both) of the remaining corners with warm water. Then, take each corner and fold it neatly over the filling. Bring the two corners together so that they come together flat against one another. The end result should be that these two corners are stuck together pointing roughly upwards over the filling, which is gathered in the bottom.


If you need to, you can lightly pinch the two upward-pointing corners together to help them adhere to each other.
Congratulations! You're done.

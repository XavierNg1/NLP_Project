 Use a soft brush attachment on your vacuum cleaner and vacuum the entire surface. Pay particular attention to seams and hard to reach areas. Dust, dirt, and crumbs can collect in these crevices and scratch the material if they are not removed., If you are cleaning a leatherette wallet, shoes, or purse it may be difficult to vacuum it to remove dust or crumbs. Instead, you can dust the surface using a dry cloth. Wipe the entire leatherette surface so that there is no dust or dirt remaining.
 It is a good idea to routinely clean leatherette using a damp cloth. This will help remove any spills that may have occurred and can help to keep the surface clean after general use.

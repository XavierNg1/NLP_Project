 Have students enter the site, then let them spend about 15 to 20 minutes browsing some of the articles. You may want to make a class list of some of the more interesting or esoteric titles the students find in their searches so they understand that there is a lot of latitude for subject matter.;
, Give students two "wikiHow Evaluation Worksheets" to fill out, one for each article they've chosen. The wikiHow site offers a very helpful primer which can be reached at www.wikihow.com/Writer's-Guide; the criteria for evaluation of an exemplary wikiHow article are all there; simply use these to set up your evaluation sheets. (They're also helpful for creating a final evaluation rubric for your students' postings.)

, Encourage students to write about something they are really interested in; this is a big factor in successful completion of the assignment.
 They should conduct a search on wikiHow to make sure that there is not already an article on wikiHow that is written on that particular topic. If they find an article on their topic, they can come up with a different topic or they can be encouraged to improve the existing article based on the critiquing skills developed in previous steps.


It's very important that the originality of the topic is verified before the student writes the article because it can be very disappointing to see their article get merged or deleted as a result.
 Simply click on the "create an account" option. Tell underage students to create a username code that protects student identity -- for instance, use their first name and a class code -- and record this and their password for future reference and access to their articles.
 It's important to know that the title cannot easily be edited later, so have students proofread this carefully for typos and spelling errors.

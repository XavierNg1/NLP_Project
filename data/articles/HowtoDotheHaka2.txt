 This person will not stand in formation with the others in the group. Instead, the leader will shout out some of the lines, giving direction to the group. The leader reminds the group how to conduct themselves during the Haka. A Haka leader should have a strong, fierce voice and speak clearly and forcefully.This leader may be the leader of your sports team or group.
 Often, sports teams perform the Haka together before beginning a match. There is not a particular number of people you need to perform the Haka, but if the group is larger, then the effect of the Haka is more intimidating and impressive.
 If you want to perform a Haka with your sports team before a match, make sure you have alerted the game’s officials and the other team.


If your opponent is the one performing the Haka, watch respectfully with your team.
 The Haka will look fiercer if your group stands in a formation of some sort, as though you are going to set off into organized battle. Walk from a bunched group into a few lines of people. Give yourself lots of arm room, since you’ll be swinging your arms around.

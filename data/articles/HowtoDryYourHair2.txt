 If you can, try to get one with long sleeves. Any t-shirt will do, but if you have thick or long hair, you may want to get a larger t-shirt.


T-shirts are made out of softer material than towels. Because they are so smooth, they snag on your hair less. This will help minimize rips, tears, and frizz.
 The best time to add hair products to curly, kinky, or textured hair types is when the hair is still soaking wet.


If your hair is tangled, you can gently comb it at this point. Use a wide-toothed comb, and work in small sections, starting from the ends first. Never use a brush.
 The arms and neck hole should be facing you, and the bottom hem should be facing away from you.
 Try to get your hair as centered as possible. Your hair should be right between the shirt and the top of your head. You want your head very close to the shirt and your plopped hair, but not actually touching it.
 Pinch the hem between your fingers, and lift it off the table or chair. Bring it over towards your neck, and let go. The hem should be covering the entire back and nape of your head.
 Take the shirt by the shoulders and pull it up and against your forehead. Slide your hands along the sleeves, and hold them tightly.
 Pull the arms towards the back of your head. They should cross right over the shirt hem. Tie them in a tight knot. If the sleeves are long enough, you can wrap them back around your head, and tie them in a knot right above your forehead.


The sleeves of the shirt will hold your shirt-turban in place.
If the sleeves are too short, try securing them with a bobby pin or a safety pin.
 This may take around 20 minutes, depending on how thick or long your hair is.Some people, however, like to plop-dry their hair before blow-drying it the rest of the way.

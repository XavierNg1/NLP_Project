,  Even if the car ride isn't much more than one to the store or school, it's going to feel different to the kids.
  It may seem nice to tell them to just follow the instructions, especially if they're over 10, but the instructions might get confusing for even you, and your kid is going to have trouble focusing.
  Even if your kids seem really enthusiastic about hiking, swimming, or fishing, they may start to get bored.  Keep things fast-paced so you're constantly having fun.
  You may want your kids to start eating squash and rice crackers instead of hamburgers and cookies, but if you want them to like camping, right now isn't the time to crack down.
  It's going to be scary for them, especially one the first night, so give them plenty of time to settle down before they really need to be asleep.
  It's nice to go camping for 10 days, but you need to be ready for your 7-year-old to get sick or freak out and decide she's not camping for more than two days.

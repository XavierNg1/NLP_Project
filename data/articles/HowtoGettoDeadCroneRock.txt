 Open your map and select Markarth, a pop-up screen will ask if you want to Fast Travel there. Select “Yes,” and you’ll instantly get to Markarth from wherever you were.


Once you get to Markarth, head out of the city through the main gate at the south. Right outside Markarth, you’ll see some stables. This will be your starting point.;
, Head south from the stables, either on foot or on horseback. Head past the stone bridge and follow the stone road.
 After a couple of yards, you’ll see a path on the right that leads off the stone road. Travel down this straight path, past a stone bridge, up to Dushnikh Yal.


Dushnikh Yal is an Orc stronghold surrounded by wood/log fences.
 Once you’re near the Dushnikh Yal gate, get off the path and head to the right. You’ll see another path here. Follow this winding path up until you’re in Purewater Run, a cave on the side of the road.


You may need to get off the path you’re on to discover this, or you can continue on your course.
 As you travel down the path, through Purewater Run (you don’t need to go inside the cave), you’ll eventually come across another stone bridge. Cross this bridge and continue down the path until you see some shadows of tall stone formations on the horizon.
 Head towards the stone formation and you’ll reach Hag Rock Redoubt. Behind the rock formations, you’ll see a watchtower. A Forsworn will come out and attack you.
 Kill the Forsworn and enter the watchtower. Once you get to the top, you’ll see a stone bridge that leads to an open area. Cross this bridge and follow the path, killing enemy Forsworns as you walk and climb staircases.
 At the end of this path, you’ll find a small wooden door that opens to a dungeon. This is the entrance to Dead Crone Rock.

 People with asthma and other health conditions should not be exposed to second hand smoke.


You, as the host always have the option of not allowing any smoking on or around your premises. However, you may want to make this clear before the party.
Smokers will usually be happy with an outdoor space such as a balcony, porch, front steps, or garden.
 If you know your friends fairly well, you will likely know if people are vegetarian, or on a low-calorie diet, or allergic to peanuts.


Label items. Make labels to sure your friends know which one is the vegetarian chili. An ingredient list can be helpful, too. You may not know a person has an allergy.
Leave labels out. It allows the person to be able to make more informed decisions. It is easy to overlook ingredients, additives, and so on.

If you have store-bought items, it can be a good idea to cut out the ingredient label and any allergen warnings and have it near the food items.
For informal parties, having chip bags and drink bottles out allows people to easily look up this information


Offer vegetable plates, fruits, low-fat dips, and low-calorie options. These are all normal party food items which allow those watching calorie intake to gracefully bypass the chips.
Ask those with special food requirements what works for them. Not sure what to have for food for your co-worker who eats a Kosher diet? Or your friend who is gluten-free? Or your niece who is severely allergic to eggs? Sometimes all it takes is a quick e-mail or phone call. Sometimes such people are happy to bring a dish to share.

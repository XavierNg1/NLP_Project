 There are many possibilities for how this happened. Were you born one? Was a spell cast upon you? Did you fall into a secret moon pool? Use your imagination, and do some research if you wish to be as accurate as possible.;
, Be creative, and come up with a believable, magical place. You could come from a secret planet, or you could live in a palace in the ocean.


An example would be, "I was born on the Planet Corasoa, the Realm of the Wind."

, Explain who your ancestors are and whether you are of royal blood or not. You could claim that your father was a sea god (ex: Poseidon). Make it as interesting as possible, but be careful about exaggerating too much. Don't forget to include siblings and close relatives, such as aunts, uncles, or cousins.
 There are many different types, so do your research and choose the one that appeals to you the most. Common mermaids are:


Sirens
Encantados
Naiads

, Mermaids have many different abilities. Some can charm humans with their singing, and others have the ability to communicate with animals. Certain types can control nature (ex: the wind, moon, waves, weather, etc.).


Limit your powers. Make sure you choose only three or four. If you have too many, it could seem unrealistic.

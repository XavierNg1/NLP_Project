 Before you bring your senior dog around children, you should have some sense about your dogâ€™s experience with children, and whether or not your dog likes kids. The degree to which your dog has been socialized plays a major role in how they act around children. If you have acquired your senior dog late in life, try to find out all you can about their previous owner(s) and how much time, if any, they have spent around children.Speak to the shelter where you acquired your dog.
Talk to you vet about any history they may know.
If possible, speak directly to a previous owner.
 Certain breeds of dogs have more patience with children than others. This is true in senior dogs, as well. Beagles, labs, Newfoundlands, and English bulldogs, for example, are known for being great with kids. Weimaraners, rottweilers, and terriers, on the other hand, are not known for their patience. Take this into consideration when you bring your senior dog around children. Dogs with a lower tolerance for child behavior may become frustrated more easily and act out., Anytime you bring your senior dog into a new situation, particularly one involving kids, you need to watch out for signs of stress or discomfort. Your senior dog may become frightened, feel threatened, or be in pain. This could cause them to act out or even bite.Prior to acting out or biting, your dog may:


Emit a low growl
Show their teeth
Perk up their ears
Lift their tail up, possibly wagging stiffly

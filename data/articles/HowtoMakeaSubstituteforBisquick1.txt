 In a large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together. Use a whisk or a large spoon to get a nice even mixture.


All-purpose flour works best here. However, alternatives are possible. For example, to make gluten-free pancakes, substitute buckwheat or almond flour.;
, Shortening, oil, and other fats are sometimes tricky to mix evenly into dry ingredients like flour. Using a technique called "cutting" can help. To cut the fat in, put or pour it onto the dry ingredients, then use two knives to distribute it in a "criss-crossing" motion. Continue until it is well-combined and the mixture naturally forms blueberry-sized clumps.If using melted butter, disperse the butter as evenly as possible before mixing. It's a little harder to get butter to mix evenly than it is when using the other ingredients.
 If you want a mix that's guaranteed to be even or you're having trouble cutting in solid fat like shortening, consider using a pastry blender. Some recipes even call for for this handy kitchen tool specifically.Simply the pulsing the ingredients together a few times until they're well-combined should be enough to achieve the desired consistency. If it has a "cut" setting, use this. If not, any general "combine" setting should be fine.

, For 2 player (unless your friend is playing) select a random character, kart, & drift.
 Go to the nearest item boxes. Normally when in first place, you get bananas or green shells. After getting bananas, continue racing.



Often, other players try to get behind you when you're in first place in order to slip-stream you. This can be avoided by swerving, but you might crash.
Pick up an item box & hope you get a banana. If you do, carefully watch the person behind you.
Wait till they're right behind your kart, then activate the banana, causing them to spin out.
 When in first place, you often get lots of bananas. One of the ways you can make use of them is to carefully place the bananas across the road. If driving on a curvy track with not much room, simply drop the bananas. If the track is straight, slowly move to the left or right, dropping bananas as you go to create a 'wall'.
 In the game, red shells are often thrown at you. If you have bananas, hold on to at least one, and drop the others. However if someone has a red shell shield, keep all 3 bananas. If not, throw all bananas back except one.
 When driving, carefully drop a banana into an item box (so it's hidden). Usually the 2nd & sometimes (if not to far apart) 3rd place racers see you, and avoid the box. However not everyone sees you do it, and some racers may hit the box. If you have a lead, this trick is more fun.

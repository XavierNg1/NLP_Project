 Search online or call the local information hotline if you’re not sure what cab companies are near you. Most cab companies are available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, but double check before you call., Give them your address and ask how long it will be until your driver arrives. If you’re in a busy area, ask what the company’s cabs look like so you can spot your driver quickly., You may have to wait longer when ordering a cab over the phone. If you have a long wait, hang out inside your hotel room or go to a nearby cafe to pass the time. Make sure your phone’s on in case your driver tries to call you.

Go outside 10-15 minutes before your scheduled pickup time in case your driver is early.

 The easiest way to add PDFs to your iPhone is to sync them using iTunes. If you don't have iTunes, you can download it for free from apple.com/itunes/download.
 Once iTunes is open, click the "..." button at the top of the window. Select "Books" from the menu that appears. This will display your iTunes book library.
 This tab appears when you open the Books section of iTunes. This will display the PDFs that are currently in your iTunes library.
 Click and drag the PDF files and release them in the iTunes window to add them to your iTunes Books library.
 It will appear in the top row of buttons after a moment. If this is your first time connecting your iPhone to your computer, you'll be taken through a brief setup process, which won't affect the data on your iPhone.
 Highlight all of the PDF files that you want to copy in the "My PDFs" section of your iTunes Books library. You can press Ctrl/⌘ Cmd+A to highlight all of them, or hold Ctrl/⌘ Cmd and click each one you want to select.
 You'll see a sidebar appear on the left side of the iTunes window.
 This will immediately start copying the PDF files to your iPhone's storage. You can monitor the progress at the top of the iTunes window.
 Once the PDF files have finished copying to your iPhone's storage, click the Iphone button at the top of the screen and then click the "Eject" button. You can then safely disconnect your iPhone from your computer.
 After the files have copied, you can find all of your PDFs in the iBooks app.

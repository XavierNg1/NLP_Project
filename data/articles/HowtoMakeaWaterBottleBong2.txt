Remove the lid from the bottle and discard it.
 Any plastic pen that can be taken apart to leave a hollow cylinder will work.
 Your pen shaft will extend at an angle into the water.
 If the hole is too big, it will be hard to get a tight seal.


If it turns out that your hole is too big, you can still salvage the bong. Just place pieces of tape where the pen shaft meets the bottle to make a tighter seal.
 On the opposite side of the bottle, make another small hole (about the size of a pencil eraser).This will be used as the carb when you are smoking.
 Affix a metal socket to the outside end of the pen shaft. Use another few layers of duct tape to make a seal. The socket is your bowl.


You can use any sort of metal socket that is the right size. Look around your house for a suitable object. If you can’t find anything, visit a hardware store, where you’ll find lots of possibilities.
 Pour water from the top of the bottle into the bottom of the bong. Fill it approximately 1/5 full.
 Don’t overdo it; you can always add more later, but you don’t want it spilling over the sides.
 Place your mouth at the top of the bottle, where the lid was. Tip the bong so that the bowl is facing away from your body.
 Using a lighter, ignite your herb and begin to suck in slowly to force the smoke through the water. Make sure to place a finger over the carb hole while doing this.
 Set the lighter down when the bottle is filled with smoke. Remove your finger from the carb hole. Suck the smoke in deeply through the top of the bottle.

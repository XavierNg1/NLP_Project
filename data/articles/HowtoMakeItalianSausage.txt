 (2.2kg) of pork shoulder. Cut it away from the bone if it is not cut already.


You can also make Italian sausage that is part beef and part pork. Replace 2 lbs. (0.9kg) of pork shoulder with ground beef to adjust the recipe.;
, Ask whether the casings should be soaked beforehand or not.


If the sausage casings require soaking, place them in a bowl of orange juice and salt for 1 hour. Keep them moistened before using them.
 Grind the pork (and beef) together using a meat grinder or a meat grinder attachment on your stand mixer.
 Add the beef, if you are doing a mixed meat sausage.
 You will need to decide if you want a sweet or hot Italian sausage.


If you want to make a traditional hot Italian sausage then add 2 tsp. (4g) of crushed fennel seed, 1 tbsp. (18g) salt, 1 tbsp. (6.9g) of black pepper, 2 tbsp. (10.8g) of hot pepper flakes and/or cayenne pepper, 1 tbsp. (1.9g) of parsley leaves and 2 to 3 tbsp. (13.8 to 20.7g) of paprika.
If you want to make a sweet Italian sausage, then do not add hot pepper flakes, cayenne pepper or the whole measure of black pepper. Add the full 3 tbsp. (20.7g) of paprika.
 Knead the spices into the meat until it is well combined.
 Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
 This will help to make the meat move evenly through the attachment.
 Place it at the bottom of your stuffing attachment.
, Try to fill well, so that there are not too many air bubbles.
 If you are using a traditional intestinal casing, you may want to tie with a string.
 Twist the sausage several times at intervals between 3 and 8 inches (7.6 to 20cm), depending upon how large you want your sausages to be.
, Freeze them immediately.


Make sure you cook your sausages well before eating, since they are not pre-cooked like many store-bought varieties. Boil them for 10 minutes or grill until the internal temperature is 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65.5 degrees Celsius).

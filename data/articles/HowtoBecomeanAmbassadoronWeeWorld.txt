You need to be nice and help everyone around. When a Weemee asks a question be helpful and supportive to them. Don't be a bully; be fair to others

Many new Weemees come on the site and are sometimes lost. It's always nice to help them around. Just show them everything they need to know.



Most people just become an ambassador for the fame. You need to make sure you are comfortable with being one. It takes lots of hard work to be one. Just be yourself and find your own style when you help. You can have a laugh once in a while, though; no need to be a robot.



Weeworld has its own term of conditions and you need to follow them. Make sure you don't break them and if you do it might lower your chances of being an ambassador.



You need to know many things about the sites to help Weemees. Usually you need to be higher than level 10 to be an ambassador but the level doesn't really count. Just make sure you can answer questions. You really don`t need to know all the answers. Make blogs or helpful guides.

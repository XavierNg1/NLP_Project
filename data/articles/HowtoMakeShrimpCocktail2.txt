 In a medium bowl, mix together ketchup, chili sauce, horseradish, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and salt. Stir until evenly mixed.
 Allow to chill while the shrimp cook.
 While fresh shrimp are superior in taste and texture, frozen shrimp can be perfectly acceptable if that's all you got. Just make sure to factor in extra cooking time if you do decide to use frozen shrimp.
 It's a little bit of hassle to peel the shell from the shrimp at the end of the day, but the taste makes up for it. Shrimp with their tails and shells still on are said to taste better.Another option is to cook your shrimp with shells and tail on, and then peel them after cooking is complete.
Look for shrimp that are "ready to peel." This simply means that they've been de-veined, so that you don't have to go through the hassle of removing their guts. If you want to de-vein shrimp yourself, check out this handy tutorial.
 How you cook your shrimp will depend on two things: whether they are fresh or frozen, and how large they are.


Fresh jumbo shrimp will take about 5 minutes to cook. Once they turn from translucent to opaque, they're ready to take out.
Frozen (uncooked) shrimp generally take a bit longer. If you put them in the water, wait for the water to come back to a boil and then test one; they're usually finished when the water has returned to a boil. You can also defrost your shrimp first in cold water to make the cooking process go faster.
 Shocking shrimp in the ice bath will halt the cooking process and keep them from becoming rubbery.
 Make sure the shrimp aren't wet before you assemble them.
 A classic placement is to surround your cocktail sauce with shrimp and lemon wedges on a bed of ice.

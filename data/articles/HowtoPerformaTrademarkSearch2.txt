 Adopting this approach, the attorney will also be able to render a professional opinion as to whether your trademark is viable


An attorney may have access to additional resources for performing a trademark search or simply be more experienced with analyzing the results of a search.
If you find that your initial trademark search results in a number of similar businesses using a similar trademark as you wish to use and you would prefer not to change your trademark, it is a good idea to talk with a lawyer who can determine whether your trademark would be valid.

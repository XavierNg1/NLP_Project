 It's surprisingly fun. Turn up the difficulty for some added risk. You'll never get bored exploring your huge infinite world!


Gathering resources is an incredibly relaxing thing for some people.
 Open a Superflat world. Make sure you are in survival, with monsters on. The difficulty doesn't matter, as long as it's not peaceful (but if you get tired of all the slimes, peaceful's okay.)


Immediately run to the nearest village. Make sure generated structures is on.
Chop some logs from the houses, and maybe some of the wheat. Craft them into planks, and make a crafting table.
Make a wooden pickaxe, and get some cobblestone from the houses. Don't take too much, though, as if you take too much the villagers won't even recognize the house anymore.
Make some stone tools. Make 1x pick, 2x axes, 3x shovels and 2x swords. Also look for a blacksmith, if there is any, and check the chest for anything good. If there are saplings, that is really good because then you can make your tree farm.
Keep trying to survive.

 The colors and sizes of your materials will be dependent on what the decorations will be used for. The feathers should be purchased in the ideal color, but butterfly bases can be painted before you begin or adorned with beads and jewels later.









In this tutorial, a card image of a butterfly body has been cut out to the exact shape and the feathers have been glued to the back of the card design. In this case, you have less room to change the colors but it will provide a sophisticated look at the end.;

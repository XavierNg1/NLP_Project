 While the benefits are countless, this is one of the hardest things to implement into your daily routine. Water lowers body fat, flushes cellulite, improves digestion, gets rid of dark circles under the eyes, and makes you feel full. These are just a few of the benefits of drinking the required 2.5 liters/quarts of water per day. Break the amounts down into manageable amounts:


Keep a bottle of water beside your bed. Before you go to sleep drink 1/2 the bottle (Note: this will most likely increase the need to urinate during the night) and as soon as you wake up (before your feet touch the floor) drink the remaining 1/2 bottle.
Before each meal drink a half a bottle of water.
Carry water with you and sip it throughout the day.;

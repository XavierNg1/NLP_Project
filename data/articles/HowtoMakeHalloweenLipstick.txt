 Do you want your lips to be the same color as the costume or perhaps more representative of the color of the original character's lips? Whatever the reason behind the color choice, settle on a desired color.;
, Visit a dollar store, drugstore or a craft supplier to see what they have in their range.


If the exact color isn't there, you might be able to mix two shades or mix a white or black in with a color to achieve the desired color.
One way to know whether something really matches with another is to think about contrasting and comparing colors. Use colors that are the opposite or similar to the original color, not the in-between colors.
 If you need to mix colors to obtain the desired color, now is the time to do that. Pulverize the eyeshadow or chalk into a powder, if it isn't already. It shouldn't have any lumps, so stir and press until it forms a powder. A mortar and pestle can be helpful for this but don't use a porous one as it'll stain.
 Mix it in the same bowl as the eyeshadow or chalk powder.
 This will give the lipstick a nice flavor.
 Use a cotton bud or similar to apply the homemade lip color to your lips. After wearing, wash it off and/or use makeup remover if it stains your lips and won't come off.

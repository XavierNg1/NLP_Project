 Espresso beans are roasted specifically for use in espressos, and will likely produce better results than ordinary coffee beans. While there are many, many varieties and blends of espresso bean, the most basic distinction is between the lighter Arabica and darker Robusta. While espresso is more concentrated and dark than regular coffee, this does not mean it needs to use blends high in Robusta beans. A blend with as little as 10-15% Robusta will produce a dark, "biting" espresso without additional, potentially unpleasant flavors from overuse., Find a dark spot at the back of your cupboard or pantry, not the fridge where it can pick up food smells and moisture. Use any container with an airtight, watertight seal. Even when stored this way, beans tend to lose quality rapidly after one or two weeks.Freezing may or may not affect the taste of espresso beans. Opening the container of frozen beans, however, causes harmful moisture to condense on the beans. Divide the espresso beans into multiple containers to limit the number of times each one is opened. Pack tightly to remove most of the air., Espresso will stay freshest as whole beans, not grounds. Try to use up all your grounds within a few days after they are ground for best results., If you are switching to a new coffee beans or blend and want to get a pure flavor, run a few beans through the grinder first to remove most of the coffee grit from the last variety you used. You can use this for espresso if you don't mind a mixed cup, or simply toss it in the compost or trash.

 When many people think about dancing for stress relief, they think about blasting loud music and bouncing around to the beat. But you can attain similar stress relief benefits by slowing things down and connecting with your body.


Dancing slowly will help you connect your body with your feelings and allow you to express yourself, perhaps in a way that more energetic dancing will not.Slower movements will help you stretch out and increase your flexibility.Slower dancing will help you focus on your breathing, which can help you relax., If you are dancing to relax and de-stress, you may want softer music, dimmer lights, and lots of room to stretch and express yourself.


Pick a few good songs. Suitable songs will have an easy-to-follow tempo, they will just be slower than the more energetic numbers. You might consider classical, ballads (slow songs), slower folk music, or Celtic music.
You might wish to find music with lyrics that have a message that match your mood.
Dim the lights if possible.
 Use stretching movements with your arms and slow bending exercises to release the stress of the day from all parts of your body. Slowly move to the music. Think of stretching, expanding, and breathing.


Forget the problems that caused you the stress. Focus on the music and the movement of your body.
Breath deeply to aid in relaxation.
You might wish to try this before bedtime to help you stretch, relax, and fall asleep faster. Keep the lights dim and the music slow and soft.

 Tie it onto a thin dowel or long matchstick and dangle it down into the glass candle jar.;
, Peel off their covers. Break each crayon into four pieces, if they're not already stubs.


Sort into their respective colors.
 In each cup, put the four pieces of crayon of the same color. Then, fill up each cup with the candle wax.
 SetÂ the time for 2 minutes and 20 seconds. Do the same with the rest of the cups.
 It will be very hot and hot wax spilled on skin can burn, so take great care. Stir the mixture with a craft or popsicle stick.
 Check that the wick has stayed centered.
 Do the same with the other waxes, adding the next layer after the former one has properly set. As you go, each layer will form a beautiful layered effect, creating a rainbow style candle. Once you have added all of the wax and the layers are stuck together, the candle is almost ready.
 Discard the leftover wick piece.
 The candle can now be used or given as a gift.

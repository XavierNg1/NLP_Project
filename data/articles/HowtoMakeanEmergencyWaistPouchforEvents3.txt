 Have it match the pattern of your pouch, preferably stretchy and about 5 inches (12.5cm) wide., Sew along the long edge, transforming it into a tube., Scrunch up the fabric and move the pin through the tube until it pokes out the other end, then pull it out, bringing the fabric with it and folding the tube right side out., If you need a waist pouch, sew the tube onto the sides of your pouch and make it about the size of your waist. If you need a cross-body bag, sew the tube onto the top and sling it over your shoulder. You choose!

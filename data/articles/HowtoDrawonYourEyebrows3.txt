 The first thing you should do to fix over-plucked eyebrows is to stop plucking and waxing. The best way to achieve a good brow shape is to let them grow out for about a year or so.


Using a brow razor to shape will help stimulate growth.If you absolutely can't stop tweezing, let your brows grow for at least three weeks before plucking again.Too-frequent plucking can damage your follicles, causing permanent damage., Many people have small bald patches within their eyebrows, but chronic over-tweezers may find them particularly worrisome.









Use an eyebrow pencil or dust on powder with an angled brush. Pick a pencil or powder that is close to the same shade as your natural eyebrows. Layering with both can create a more natural look.
When using a fine pencil, fill in with multiple light strokes to mimic the look of individual hairs.
Delicately brush off excess pigment with a clean makeup brush.
Add another layer of pigment and do another brush-off. Repeat this process until your eyebrows are as dark as you'd prefer.
Set your brows with gel to keep the makeup from rubbing off as you go about your day., Just like mascara for eyelashes, brow mascara (sometimes called brow gel) enhances eyebrows by coating individual hairs, making them appear longer, darker, and more defined. Pick a gel that's closest to your natural hair color, and brush it on going from your nose to your arch. Brow mascara also works to shape your eyebrows and keep them in place all day.

 To make the game more fun, you might ask them how many times per week they would like to have ice cream, go out to eat, or something similar. Once they have a number in mind, ask them to announce it.Say that they choose the number 6. This will be the example used throughout this method.;
, You can do this math by hand or your friend can use a calculator for the rest of the trick. Explain to your friend that they must hit the equal (=) button after each instruction you give.


Example: 6 x 2 = 12.



Example: 12 + 5 = 17.



Example: 17 x 50 = 850.
 If their birthday has passed already, then tell them to add 1767 to the prior result. If their birthday is coming up, then ask them to add 1766 to the prior result.


Example 1: (with prior birthday): 850 + 1767 = 2617.
Example 2: (with upcoming birthday): 850 + 1766 = 2616.
Be aware that the numbers are for the year 2017. If you are performing these calculations in a later year, then you would use the numbers 1768 and 1767 for 2018, 1769 and 1768 for 2019, and so on.



Example 1: 2617 - 1981 (year of birth) = 636
Example 2: 2616 – 1981 (year of birth) = 635

, The first digit, the one in the hundred’s place, will be the original one chosen. The remaining two numbers will reveal your friend’s age.


Example 1: The answer is 636. 6 was the original number chosen. 36 is the current age.
Example 2: The answer is 635. 6 was the original number chosen. 35 is the current age.

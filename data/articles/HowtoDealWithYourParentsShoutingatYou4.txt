 Often, you will already know why your parent is shouting at you. If you didn’t clean your room, acted in a disrespectful way, or did something wrong, identify the behavior. Sometimes, you genuinely won’t know why your parents are shouting, so try asking.


Say, “Can you tell me why you are shouting?”
Ask, “What did I do wrong?”
Get advice: “How can I change my behavior?”

, Once you figure out why your parents are shouting at you, before shouting is necessary, change your behavior so your parents approve of it. This is the safest tactic and the most beneficial in the long run. Most parents will appreciate you trying to act differently.


For example, if your parents shout when you don’t do your homework, do your homework every day.
Clean your room if they are shouting about you being messy.
If your parents say you have an attitude, try to be more respectful.
 If your parents shout about something you really do not want to change, just compromise with them. They might shout about the way you dress, the color you want to paint your bedroom, or even the food you eat.Compromising a little bit can go a long way.


Tell your parents something is important to you: “I really want to paint my walls red because I think the color is beautiful.”
Offer a compromise: “Ok, what if I eat healthy for two meals a day instead of only one?”
Ask them to meet you in the middle: “I really don’t want to wear baggy jeans. Can’t I wear tight jeans some of the time?”

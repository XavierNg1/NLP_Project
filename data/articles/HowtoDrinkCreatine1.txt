 Creatine powder usually comes in a large plastic container with a scoop inside for measuring out the correct dosage. Go to a nutrition store or health food store and select a powder to use.


Some creatine comes in pure form, and other powders are mixed with sugar so you can create a sweet energy drink.
Avoid liquid creatine. Creatine begins degrading the moment it is mixed with water, so packaged liquid creatine is actually creatine waste. Manufacturers of such products are pulling a fast one on consumers.
Creatine has been tested in multiple studies and is considered safe to use, but since it is a supplement, it has not been formally approved by the FDA. Check with your doctor if you're taking medication or have a condition that might be affected by taking a supplement.;
, Creatine manufacturers recommend starting out with a high dosage of creatine and gradually waning to a "maintenance" dose to maintain creatine levels in your body. It is also common to forego the loading period and base your dosage on body weight.


Loading is said to be safe for the body and help the consumer see results - bigger, stronger muscles - in just a few days.
Creatine may affect insulin levels, so if you have a condition related to high or low blood sugar, use caution when taking high doses. You may want to consider the more moderate body weight-based method., It doesn't matter when you take your creatine; whether you consume it in the morning or at night, it will have the same effect on your body. However, for best results, consume it at the same time each day so that your body has time to process one dose before you consume the next one.


Some people like to take creatine right before a workout, but its effects aren't instant, so it doesn't actually provide an immediate energy boost for weight-lifting and other exercises.
If you want to take creatine on the go, bring a separate water bottle and store the creatine dry. If you premix it, the creatine will degrade.

 Ammonia can damage cares with tinted windows. Almost all household glass cleaners contain ammonia. Look for a glass cleaner which is labelled “Safe for tinted windows” if you have tinted windows. These are readily available at auto stores.Plain water is a great windshield cleaner. However, it does not contain the same compounds as commercial glass cleaner, and is somewhat less effective. If you want to use water as a glass cleaner, you should definitely use it in conjunction with a microfiber towel to ensure your windshield is scrubbed clean.
Keep in mind that ammonia is very harmful to a variety of materials. Ammonia can also be hazardous to your health, so be wary of using it on the interior of you car.
 If you’re applying wax or polish, or repainting your vehicle, ensure you do it before you begin cleaning your windshield. Otherwise, you might end up getting a bit of polish or other undesirable substance on your windshield after it has already been cleaned. If you’re cleaning the windows on the interior of your car, do them before cleaning your windshield from the inside so as to avoid getting the cleaning agents on your clean windshield., Park your car beneath a shady tree or in your garage before beginning a windshield cleaning.
 Obtain a high-quality microfiber towel to clean your windshield. Ensure it has a weight of at least 300 GSM. These towels can hold up to eight times their weight in water and are gentle on the smooth finish of your windshield. Further, they prevent scratches by inducing electrostatic attraction in the particulate affixed to your windshield. The matter is thus lifted from, rather than dragged across, your windshield.Microfiber towels are readily available at your local auto care shop.

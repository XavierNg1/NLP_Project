 Look for the Google Earth app on your mobile device and tap on it. The app icon has a blue sphere with white lines on it.


Once launched, you will see a beautiful 3D rendition of our world.
 You can use the location button on the header toolbar to set the map to your current location or you can use the search box beside it to find another place on the map.


Finding your current location—Tap the compass button on the header toolbar. The map will adjust based on your current location. Your current location will be identified by a blue dot on the map.
Finding another location—Use the search box and type in the location you want. A shortlist of possible results will drop down. Tap the location you want, and the map will automatically draw to the location you’ve set. A red pin will drop to identify it.
 Tap the Pegman found on the top right corner right under the compass. The areas on the map that have Street View will be highlighted. Drag and drop the Pegman onto the area of the map with Street View. The map view will be changed to Street View.
 Swipe around the map to navigate through the Street View images. Arrows will appear on your screen to help you navigate through the streets. You will feel like you’re walking or driving down the street as you view the images of that location. Once you’ve found the exact image you want to be removed, stop.
 Tap the menu button found on the top left corner to bring down the app menu. Tap “Settings” from here, then “Send Feedback.” A small window will appear with the feedback form. The Street View image you’ve last visited will be included in the report.
 Fill up the form with the required information. Be as detailed as you need to be to indicate which part or parts of the image you want to be blurred and for what reason. You can indicate that you want your face, your car, your house, or another object blurred. Tap the “Send” button on the lower right corner of the window to submit the report to Google.

 Develop your child's curiosity in order to develop his creative writing skills. Ask your child questions about the world around you in order to spark his curiosity and creativity.Having interesting, thoughtful conversations in the home will help your child develop the curiosity and vocabulary necessary to becoming a creative writer.For example, you might:


Ask your child to look out a car window and think about where people on the sidewalk are headed
Point out animals while you're walking and ask your child to think about what the lives of these animals are like
Ask your child to come up with a new name for his favorite park
Ask your child what his favorite building is and why he likes it so much

, Sometimes children might not be able to come up with completely unique characters, settings, and plots. In order to get them to practice writing creatively, consider having your child write a new version of an old classic, such as a fairy tale.What would your child change about the story to make it his own?

, An effective writing prompt can be to pick a sentence out of your child's favorite book and asking her to write a story around that sentence.See if your child can come up with a story that departs from the original source material to teach her how versatile creative writing can be.
 Wordless books can be an excellent way to have your child practice coming up with story ideas. These books have intricate, whimsical pictures that can allow your child to brainstorm an infinite number of new stories and ideas.Check out or purchase a few wordless books and ask your child to figure out what the words might be.

, Use a regular plastic-tooth comb and make sure you can run it through your hair from root to tip without resistance before you begin.
 If your metal hot comb is larger or smaller, you can adjust the size of each section, making sure the hair easily fits through the comb. Keep each section together with a hair clip.



If you bought a hot iron comb product, use the electric heater or cord that came with it. To heat a hot comb on a stove top, hold it over a medium flame until it is hot to the touch.
Test the metal hot comb before you use it by setting it on a paper towel. If the towel turns brown, your hot comb straightener is too hot and will damage your hair. Let it cool and test it again before using it in your hair

Remove a clip at the back of your head. Give that hair section a quick comb-through with a normal plastic-tooth comb before using the hot metal comb. This prevents getting the hot comb stuck in your hair.
Hold the section of hair at the nape of your neck with one hand.
Use the other to gently pull the comb all the way from the root through the ends of the hair in one quick motion. Start as close to the roots as you can without burning your scalp. Avoid keeping the hot iron comb in one spot for too long, or you could scald your hair.
Continue hot combing, working your way from the back of your head to the front.
 Place it back on the burner, but remember that it is already slightly hot so it won't take as long to warm back up.


Remember to test the comb on a white paper towel each time you heat it up to make sure it isn't too hot for your hair.

 Using Table A, Unified Rate Schedule in the instruction booklet for the year of death:Locate the range between columns A and B which includes the taxable estate you calculated above.
Subtract the number in column A from the taxable estate.
Multiply the difference above by the percentage in column D.
Add the result above to the number in column C. This number is the gross estate tax.
 These credits include the basic exclusion, unused exclusion for deceased spouse, credits for foreign death taxes paid, etc. The basic exclusion is based on the year of death and can be found in the instructions for the estate tax form, IRS Form 706. For 2014, it is $5,340,000.In addition, there has been a relatively recent change in tax law that allows a deceased spouse's unused exclusion amount to be transferred to the surviving spouse. Before this change in the law, a spouse was required to use their lifetime exclusion before or at death. If that exclusion was not used, it was lost (i.e., before the law changed it could not be transferred to the surviving spouse)., This will be the amount of estate tax due. Not all credits are refundable, however, so if this amount is less than zero, this does not necessarily reflect a refund.

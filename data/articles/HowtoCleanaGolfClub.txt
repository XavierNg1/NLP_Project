 The water shouldn't be too hot or it might cause the ferrule on the gold club to loosen up, making the club head less stable. The bucket should also ideally be big enough to fit in as many club heads as necessary at once.


Only use enough water to barely cover any clubheads that you'll be submerging in the bucket. You don't want the warm water to come up all the way to the ferrules of the club.;
, For normal wear and tear, 5 minutes in sudsy water should be enough. For particularly dirty clubs or vexing stains, 10 minutes might be necessary.
 Being gentle with the clubheads, Start cleaning the the face first, then the back and finally the top and bottom.


Never use a wire-bristle brush for your cleaning, as this can damage the face of the club and potentially affect its performance.
Do not submerge any woods in the warm soapy water.Instead, simply wash off the clubhead with a damp towel as much as possible. Get inside the grooves on the face of the club with a toothpick or a similar instrument.
 Remember to try to avoid getting the ferrules wet, although a little moisture won't be the end of the world.
 Make sure the entire club is clean and dry upon inspection.
 Never put a wet or damp club back in your golf bag. Dry fully with a cloth before storing.

 Don’t waste your time trying to spray down range on your way, just get to cover as soon as possible.;
,, That is, travel in a group of two so one person can cover the other while they move from location to location. This is one of the most effective strategies for a game of this nature. It affords a certain adaptability from a pre-game plan that is vital in effecting a decisive victory.
,, Have as many of your teammates as possible do so. It’s a huge advantage if the opposing team is unaware of who has the flag and where that person is once it has been removed.
 If there are only a few opponents left then a flat out run towards the base is advisable (zigzagging the entire way). If there is a strong opposing force left then this would be impossible and one’s movements must be covered by teammates. The flag could even be handed to a teammate to throw off the opposition.
 Needless to say this will require you and your teammates to be more brazen in your movements. If it’s a small course a center third of your team should fire on the enemy positions while the other two thirds charge down the flanks. If it’s a large course then it’s likely that a team member located on the flanks of the field can snipe the runner if they make a break for it.
 Better the loss of half of your team than the loss of the game.
 Chances are the opposition will be too shocked to react immediately. There’s still a chance you can win the game by eliminating the other team.
 When playing 2v2 or 3v3, make sure one person is always covering the extreme sides of the course. If you get flanked, you are done for.

Take a large sheet of cardboard. Cut out a large picture or photo of a Halloween witch and glue it to this sheet. Or, draw a large witch if you prefer. The witch must be seated on a broom; add an image of a broom if she is not. The cat will need to be able to "sit" on this broom, so have it sticking out a bit behind the witch.
Cut out a black cat for each guest playing the game. Put a blob of blue-tack on the back of each cat.
Hang the witch and broom picture up on the wall. Choose a space with plenty of room to move around in.;
, Have each player take a black cat. Choose the order of play (youngest to oldest is often a good choice).
 Turn the player around three times and direct the player in the direction of the witch. The aim is to get the cat sticking on the witch's broom.
 Play through until all the cats are seated on the picture. The winner is the player whose cat is sitting the best on the witch's broom.
 If a group of young children are playing, have a prize for every child.

 One of the easiest ways to customize paint is by using a stencil. Lay the stencil down on the stone you wish to paint, and then paint over it. Any area uncovered by the stencil will be painted, and any area covered will not.The contrast between the painted and not painted areas will give your stone a clear, visible design.
 If you are making concrete stones, you can place things in the concrete. As the concrete dries, it will harden around these objects. Once the concrete has fully hardened, the objects you added will be held in place.You can place things like small pebbles, trinkets, small yard decorations, or personal items in the concrete.
 While the concrete is still soft, you can use an object to indent the surface of the stone. This will leave an impression in the concrete and create a cast. Most commonly, this is done by placing your hand in the wet mix and creating a stone that has a cast of your handprints.

 To do so, get your Nook’s data cable, connect it to the micro USB port on your Nook, and plug the other end to a USB port on your computer.


Nook generally supports ePub, CBZ, and PDF eBook file types. Loading such files to your reader requires only a basic copying process.;
, The procedure for doing so will slightly vary depending on whether you’re using Windows or Mac:


For Windows computers, open “My Computer” from your desktop. Click on “Removable Disk” on the left menu panel of the My Computer window to access your Nook’s contents and to open it on a separate window.
For Mac computers, a Nook shortcut icon will appear on your desktop once your gadgets are connected. Double-click on this icon to access your Nook and to open its contents on a new window.
 Afterwards, drag them to the open Nook window. This will copy the files to the storage media of your Nook.
 Do so once the transfer is done, so you can start reading the eBooks you’ve just loaded.

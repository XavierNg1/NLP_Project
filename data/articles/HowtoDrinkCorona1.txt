 You can place your beer in the freezer, fridge or cooler. Depending on the method and the initial temperature of the beer, it could take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to cool the beer - so in deciding which method to use, consider how soon you want to open your first beer.


Be careful not to leave your beer in the freezer for more than 30 minutes, as it may explode.
Using a cooler with ice water is the fastest method to cool beer (it transfers heat more quickly).With this method, allow the ice to settle inside the cooler for an hour or longer. Once the ice melts a little, place the Corona beers inside the cooler.;
, Use a bottle opener to remove the bottle cap from the top of the beer - as all Corona bottles require a bottle opener.
 Sprinkle the rim of the bottle with a little sea salt, Lucas or salt-based seasoning of your choice. Place a lime wedge over the opening of the beer bottle and squeeze the lime juice into the bottle. Push the lime wedge into the bottle to flavor the beer even more.









If you'd like to mix the drink more completely, try putting your thumb over the top of the beer and slowly turning it upside down a few times. Be careful: Turning the beer upside down at a fast rate will cause the beer to release carbonation and explode.
 But remember to drink responsibly.

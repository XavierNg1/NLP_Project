 You must be at least 21 years old, with a personal license and personal auto insurance. You must own a car, and you must have a clean driving record. You must own an iPhone (4S or newer) or Android (2013 or newer), or rent a smartphone from Uber. Your vehicle must be a 2000 make or newer; it must have four doors, and it may not be salvaged. If you don't have a vehicle, Uber can help you get loans and discounts.;
, It should come as no surprise that the money you will earn as an Uber driver will be directly impacted by how expensive it is for you to maintain your vehicle. As such, you should:


Apply with a car that gets a large number of miles per gallon.
Apply with a car that is new and in good condition and unlikely to need frequent repairs resulting of several hours on the road each day.
Keep in mind, however, that there is a tradeoff between an expensive car that is cheap to maintain and an economical car that requires a lot of maintenance.
 If you have a car that qualifies for one of these services, you can claim a higher base fare rate and claim a higher price per mile and per minute when giving rides to customers. Such cars include (but are not limited to):


Acura RDX/MDX/TLX+

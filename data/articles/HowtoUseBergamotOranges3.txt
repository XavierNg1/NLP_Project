 Use a citrus zester or grater to peel and finely grate the rind of a Bergamot orange. Place a quarter ounce of zest in a mortar.To make one batch of essential oil, you'll be using a ratio of a quarter ounce (7 g) of zest to one cup (240 mL) of carrier oil. Grate as much zest as you'll need for the number of batches you want to make, and separate them into quarter ounce portions.
 Pour enough carrier oil into the mortar to cover the grated zest. Use a pestle to grind the zest and oil together. Continue for 15 to 30 minutes, then add the rest of the oil to the mortar.Your carrier oil should be a neutral oil, like jojoba or grapeseed. Avoid olive oil, which is too viscous and fragrant.
If you don’t have a mortar and pestle, you can use a plastic baggie and mallet to break down the zest.
 Tightly cover the mortar with plastic wrap. Let it stand out of direct sunlight for at least two days.If you’re making more than one batch of essential oil, transfer the zest and oil to a lidded container so you can use the mortar for the next batch.
 Secure cheesecloth to the top of a jar with a rubber band or string. Leave enough slack so the cloth can catch the zest when you strain the oil. Uncover the oil after it’s rested for two days and pour it slowly through the cheesecloth into the jar.After straining the oil and collecting the zest in the cloth, unfasten it from the top of the jar, keeping the zest in the cloth. Squeeze the cloth over the jar to extract as much oil as possible from the zest.
 To intensify its fragrance, you can repeat the process by using your essential oil as the carrier oil. If you don’t want to repeat the process, just keep it tightly sealed when you’re not using it. Use your Bergamot essential oil for personal fragrance, add a few drops to a bath, or fill a fragrance diffuser with it.Freeze batches that you don’t plan on using with one month. Store frozen batches for up to six months.

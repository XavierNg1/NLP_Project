 Whether or not you’re using a shower that you’re familiar with, turn on the cold water first. Then, mix in hot water until the water reaches the temperature you desire. Use your hand to test the temperature of the water before you jump in the shower. This will keep you from being scalded by overly hot water, or shocked by water that’s too cold., Once you begin taking a shower, keep in mind that your other senses will guide you. In particular, use your sense of touch to help you determine how much of products like shampoo and body wash to use, and to check for areas that need to be cleaned or rinsed, etc.For instance, while you may not be able to see exactly how much shampoo is coming out of the bottle, you can distribute it from the bottle into the palm of your hand so that you can feel how much is there. That way, you won’t use too much or too little.
 Designate places for things like shampoo, body wash, washcloths, and your towel. Be consistent about putting these things in the right place before, during, and after your shower. That way, you won’t have any problems finding what you need, and showering will be more streamlined and comfortable.Hanging a shower caddy is an easy way to gather all of your showering products into a single place.

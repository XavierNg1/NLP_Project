 Locate the stain in your purse, and gently wipe it with the cloth to get rid of the stain. This method will work for the following purse collections:


Hamptons Suede
Hamptons Mosaic
Soho Suede
Chelsea Nubuc
Don't overdo it with the vinegar. Suede does not react well to too much liquid.
 Use a new clean cloth to dab the moist part of the purse.


Let it air dry in a cool dry place. Avoid the sun or any place that is too hot.
 Gently rub the eraser over the stain until it disappears.
 If the part that you cleaned now looks flat or lacks texture, apply a small metal brush to the surface in a circular motion to get it back into shape.

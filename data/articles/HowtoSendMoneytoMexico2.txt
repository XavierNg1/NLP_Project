 If you choose to have money deposited directly into the recipient’s bank account, you may send the remittance online or in person. In order to do so, you’ll need your credit card, debit card, or the name and address of your bank, along with your bank account number and routing number.If you wish, you can also go to a physical Western Union or Moneygram location, pay cash, and have it deposited into the recipient’s account.
 Any international monetary transfer requires certain information from the recipient. In order to send money via a bank to bank transfer, you’ll need the recipient’s account information, including their full name, account number, routing number, and the name and address of their bank., Pick a service to use based on location, speed, and price. Deposits into a bank account always take longer than cash pickups, but making the deposit using a debit or credit card is quicker than doing a bank-to-bank transfer (one business day vs. five business days).If you’re sending more than $500, Western Union’s transfers into bank accounts are free. If you are sending less than that, the charge is anywhere from $1.00-$7.00, depending on the amount and form of payment. Remitly never charges for a transfer from your bank account into the recipient’s bank account (no matter the amount), but charges a flat fee of $3.99 for using a debit card. All of the other services charge anywhere from $3.00-$104 depending on the amount sent and the method of payment, with Ria’s fees for credit card payments being the highest.
 Once you’ve picked a service, register for an online account. If you are doing a bank-to-bank transfer, you’ll need to verify your account. The verification process usually involves the company making a small deposit into your account and you confirming the amounts of the deposits. Once you've verified your account, all you need to do is give final approval to the transfer.

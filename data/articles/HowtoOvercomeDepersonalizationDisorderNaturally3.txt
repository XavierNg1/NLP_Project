 If you have started meditating or practicing other relaxation techniques to reduce stress, make use of them when you're having an episode. Practice deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, or any other activity that helps you feel centered and calm.
 If you choose to consult a doctor or therapist about your condition, he or she will want to know about the circumstances that may trigger your symptoms. This information is important to develop an effective treatment plan. When you have an episode, document the time of day, what you were doing, and any emotions you experienced before the onset of symptoms. Also document the time when the symptoms subside.If you are keeping a journal, this is good information to include in your daily entry. If you are not journaling and have a smartphone, consider creating notes on your phone to keep the information handy.
 Various therapeutic modalities may be beneficial, so explore various options. Psychodynamic and cognitive behavioral individual talk therapies have been shown to be successful treatments for depersonalization/derealization disorder. If conflict contributes to your symptoms, consider couples or family therapy in addition to individual therapy. Joining a support group may be helpful if you are experiencing feelings of isolation.Be sure to tell your counselor or therapist you want to avoid medication.

 Sometimes simple things possess great complexity. Here complexity means undefined beauty. We need to observe these things. Simple changes in life can produce great effect. Many tough problems have a simple solution but we spend time thinking and making them tougher. For example, what we can do with a needle, we can't do with a sword.;
, These are the things that were not there before and might not be there forever. So savour the beauty hidden in these things, which are vanishing with passing time. Before they vanish, observe and understand the language that they speak. A river can give you moment to enjoy. You can have trip friends around them, or can just have a silent night out remembering greatest moment of your life. You can throw stones and observe the waves or count the number of dips that stone made before finally sinking down.
 We are born alone and die alone. But still in life we meet many people just because the world is too vast. We can find different kind of people in a city. But to find the person of our king we need to explore the city, or even a small place. This world is full of varieties.
 Loving nature is of it's own kind. When we die our body resolves into the nature. Experiencing the beauties of mountain, forest, ocean, fauna opens your heart and let you become a human who can contribute to every species in making their life a success. We have the ability to understand such things, so nature has given us many beauties, by loving them we can return a small part of their contribution back. The sunrise, the sunset, the fountains, the showers, glaciers all are something that we could not have imagined. The creatures who always come out as a symbol for innocence. Who understand nothing except one language that's LOVE. And they are there making our life a bit special, adventurous, and awesome. We must pay gratitude to them.

,, Once you let go of the mouse button, you will see the dotted rectangle appear over a portion of the image.
 This will remove all parts of the image that are outside of the rectangular selection.


You can resize the cropped area as you would any image.
If you don’t want to save your changes, press ⌘ Cmd+Z to undo them.



If you want to save the cropped area as a brand new file (and keep the entire image from which you cropped it), Click “File,” then “Save As,” then choose a new filename.
To revert the image to a previous version after saving, click “File,” then “Revert To,” and select “Browse All Versions…” Now, choose an older version of the image.

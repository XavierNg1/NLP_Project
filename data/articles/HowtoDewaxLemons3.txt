 Pour three parts water and one part white distilled vinegar in a spray bottle. Close the bottle, then shake well to combine.A commercial fruit and vegetable wash could be used instead of a homemade one.
Another possible fruit and vegetable wash can be made by mixing 1 Tbsp (15 ml) fresh lemon juice, 1 Tbsp (15 ml), and 1 cup (250 ml) lukewarm water. Mix these ingredients together in a spray bottle., Thoroughly douse all sides of the peel of each lemon with the vinegar cleaning solution.


Allow the solution to sit on the lemons for two to five minutes before continuing. The acidity of the cleansing solution needs several minutes to weaken and dissolve the wax.
 Scrub the lemon peels with a vegetable brush under cool, running water, applying gentle yet firm pressure.


The temperature of the water is not as significant for this method since no heat was used previously, but lukewarm to cool water is still recommended since it is the least likely to alter the internal temperature of the lemon.
Avoid using brushes or sponges that were previously used in soapy water.
Each lemon only needs to be scrubbed briefly.
 After you finish scrubbing the lemons, rinse each one under the running water to remove any remaining wax residue.


If you see any wax debris, you can use your fingers to lightly brush it off while rinsing the fruit. Do not use the brush during this step, however.
 Quickly dry the lemons by wiping off any water using clean paper towels.


If desired, you can let the lemons air dry instead of drying them with paper towel.
Do not store dewaxed lemons that are still wet.

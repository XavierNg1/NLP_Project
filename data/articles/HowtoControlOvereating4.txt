 Sometimes interpersonal issues can be related to overeating. Interpersonal therapy, a type of treatment that helps reduce overeating, focuses on your current social relationships and how they affect your eating behaviors.Surround yourself with individuals who love and respect you for who you are, not people who judge you based on what you look like or what you weigh.
Ask yourself if certain people in your life hinder your ability to stop yourself from overeating. Is there someone who does negative things which make you feel depressed? Does this contribute to your emotional eating?

, Social norms play a strong role in maintaining eating behaviors. This is why it is crucial to get support from people who love you or are on the same healthy eating path that you are on.Social support can include being involved in a weight-loss center such as Jenny Craig or Weight Watchers. Oftentimes, these types of agencies have mentors or classes you can attend.
Another option is to join Overeaters Anonymous, a 12-step program, which is available in many countries.When you have a craving to eat food that isnâ€™t healthy or you want to binge, you can call a specific person.
 You may have an issue with overeating or a Binge Eating Disorder if you find yourself eating unusually large amounts of food regularly and you cannot stop yourself.Psychologists and therapists that specialize in food-related issues can help you better develop a personalized plan to reduce your overeating.
 Medications like phentermine (Suprenza), naltrexone (Vivitrol), dexfenfluramine, and anti-depressants such as fluoxetine (Prozac), desipramine (Norpramin), fluvoxamine (Luvox), and sertraline (Zoloft), and imipramine (Tofranil) have been implicated in reducing overeating behaviors.Discuss possible medication options and side effects with your doctor (general practitioner) or psychiatrist.

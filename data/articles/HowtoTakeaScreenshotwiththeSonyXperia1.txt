 When you screenshot a page, everything on it that isn't a phone menu will be captured.
 Both the Power button and Volume Up are on the right side of your Xperia's casing. Doing so will take a screenshot of your selected screen.

This method works on most Android phones.
Screenshots are saved to the "Screenshots" folder in your Pictures app.

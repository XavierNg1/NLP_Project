 Many carpet cleaning machines say that you should use their highly concentrated cleaner when steam cleaning your carpets. However, using plain water in these machines will get a large amount of dirt and grime out of the carpet, and it won't leave any residue or chemicals behind.This method will not work on hard to clean stains. However, it is a good way to give your carpet a general, all over cleaning.;
, A natural soap, such as liquid castile soap, can be a great product for cleaning carpets. It has stain and dirt removing properties but it is not toxic or dangerous to use in your home. Combine a few drops of this type of soap with warm water and scrub your carpet with it.Carry along a dry towel with you as you clean, so that you can soak most of the water and soap out of the carpet as you go along.
If you have your own carpet cleaning machine, you can also use a few drops of this type of soap in it instead of more traditional carpet cleaning solutions.
 There are more and more commercial cleaning products available that are natural and non-toxic. Look for this type of product at your local natural food store or online through natural product distributors.


When considering using a commercial cleaner, look at both the ingredients and the rest of the label for safety information. With a truly natural and non-toxic cleaner, you are likely to find labels that certify it as a "green" product.
To find a non-toxic, natural carpet cleaner, you can look for product safety lists from organizations concerned with providing information about natural products, such as the Environmental Working Group.

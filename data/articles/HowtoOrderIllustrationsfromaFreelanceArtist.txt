 You may find one through telephone book listings, advertisements, or through friends who have contacts with one.;
, If the need is for fliers or brochures, you wouldn't go to a classical portrait artist. You may go to a graphic design studio, or to a freelancer who specializes in artwork similar to what you require.
 Don't waste the artist's time while you flounder. You can ask for some input but you should know your purpose before you call.
 Airbrush work, screen prints, computer generated images, hand drawn or painted work are all completely different both in appearance and the amount of labor involved.



How many illustrations would you like to start with?
Size and weight of the stock (paper, fabric, or plastic) you will use.
Color, and if so, color quality, black and white, glossy or matte finish, etc.

Example of the format for instructions, for illustrations, such as:

a baby tiger sitting, looking forward, no background, black and white art
an adult lion, standing, with a tree to his left and a rock to the right, color art
a human adult hand, no background, b&w
a rose, on a stem, no background, b&w
a pig wearing a straw hat, running down a lane, towards the reader, past a small house, color
maze of hedge rows seen from above, dog walking through maze, b&w
a manâ€™s face, Japanese features, short hair, facing front, b&w



, Giving thought to these considerations prior to engaging the artist will speed the process up greatly.
 A full time, professional freelance artist will usually have a set rate for their services, and their method of pricing their work may vary from one artist to another.

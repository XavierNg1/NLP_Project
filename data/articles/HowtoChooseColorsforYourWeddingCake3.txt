 You can choose a fancier wedding cake with vivid colors if you want to allocate the funds to this. However, a simple cake with only one or two colors can look quite elegant, so don't stress out if you cannot afford one that you see on television or advertised in a magazine., The taste of your cake is just as important as the look, so be sure to take flavor into consideration. Decide if you would like the flavors of your cake to influence the colors you choose.

A rich chocolate cake will be brown in color, but you can still choose any color for the frosting, icing, or decoration.
A delicately-flavored vanilla sponge cake might not suit dark purple frosting with bright orange sugar flowers, for instance, but the choice is yours., They will let you know which colors they have available. Be as specific as you can about your vision of which shade of the colors you would like to choose. If they can't make you a cake in the exact shade you want, you may want to choose another wedding cake maker, or compromise with the closest shade possible.

Ask for a cake consultation in advance of your wedding. The baker will inform you about prices, let you sample various flavors, and discuss color options for your cake. Consultations typically run from 20 minutes to an hour and can cost around $50., Remember that you don't have to be wildly extravagant. There's nothing wrong with a traditional rich fruit cake, decorated with white icing with sugar flowers that match the bride's bouquet, for example. Consider colors that are traditional to your country or culture, or research various types of wedding cakes from around the world.

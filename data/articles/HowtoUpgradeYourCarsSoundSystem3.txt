 The amplifier has a specific power rating and impedance rating. The speaker load needs to fit within these ratings or you will blow your speakers and/or burn up your amp. You need to understand the basics of wiring speakers before your start the job., No matter how much you are spending on an amp or a head unit, if you have low quality speakers, you will get low quality sound. Speakers come from 1" tweeters to 15"+ subwoofers. Generally, a smaller speaker gives clearer highs and bigger speakers give deeper lows. Mid-range speakers come in 2 way (plays high and low) and 3 way (plays highs mid and lows)., Speaker placement is important to consider. The difference in distance between the listener and one speaker as opposed to the others will change the perceived sound. It is recommended that speakers go in the kick panel when possible.However, it is sometimes necessary to put them in other locations, such as the trunk, for space purposes.
 As described in the “Upgrading by Installing an Amp” section, you will need a spool of wire to run from the speakers to the amp (unless you are replacing a pre-existing speaker and the wire is already there). Your wiring will differ depending on whether you are wiring in series or in parallel.

 Cats will not like to dig in rough surfaces. You can cover areas of your yard with a thin layer of safe materials like:Rough-textured mulch
Prickly pinecones
Pebbles and stones;
, If cats do not have enough room to move around, scratch, and dig, they will seek another area for a litter box. Inserting plant stakes, chopsticks, or similar materials (approximately ten inches in length) every eight inches in the soil will thwart cats.Make sure that the sticks or equivalent materials are inserted to a depth of a few inches into the soil so that they will stay upright.
 Some evidence shows that cats do not like certain smells, and will avoid areas that smell offensive to them. Choose a safe, preferably organic material to sprinkle throughout your yard to discourage cats from using it as their litterbox (reapply weekly, if necessary). Do not use materials such as mothballs or poisons, as these are toxic to cats, dogs, children, etc. Good, non-toxic options include: Citrus rinds (lemon, orange, grapefruit, etc.)Garlic
Onion
Anise oil
Eucalyptus oil
Tea leaves
A mixture of two parts cayenne pepper, three parts dry mustard, and five parts flour. You can also add some lion dung (you can purchase lion manure). The lion is an alpha predator and is scary to the cat. Cats won't risk visiting in case they bump into him.
 If you have a particular area that cats are using in your yard, you can deter them by covering that area in standard chicken wire (available from hardware stores).The chicken wire will be soft enough not to hurt the cats, but strong enough to discourage them from digging.


As an alternative to chicken wire, you can lay plastic sheeting designed for use in gardens.This method works best if there are only a few particular areas of your yard that cats are using as a litterbox, since it is not convenient to cover large sections of your yard in chicken wire.

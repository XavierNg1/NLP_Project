 Not a problem; you can fashion a key from many small, wire-like materials. Look for one of the following:


A paperclip. This is probably the easiest item to use for a homemade handcuffs key, and the easiest to come by. Straighten it out so you can bend it into a key-like shape.






A hairpin or bobby pin. Again, you'll need to straighten this before you can use it. If it has a plastic covering, remove it before using.
A length of stiff wire.;
, Find the keyhole on the handcuffs and place the straight piece of wire inside of it.
 With the wire placed inside the keyhole, bend it about 70 degrees.
 Put it back in the hole and bend the end again. You should end up with an angle shaped like a squiggle.
 Find the hole again and wiggle the bent part into the hole so that it points toward the locking arm. It should be at a 90-degree angle to the keyhole., Just like you would with a key, twist the piece of wire. It should lift the locking device inside and click the cuffs open.


You may have to practice twisting the key in both directions before it springs open. Be patient.






If you're unlocking the cuffs from behind your back, be very careful not to let go of the pick you're using.

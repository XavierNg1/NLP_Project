 Unfortunately, Microsoft has never issued a full version of any part of Office for free, not even very old and outdated versions. The best you can do without pirating the software is to download a free trial version. Microsoft releases trial versions of Office in the hopes that if you like it well enough, you will be willing to pay for the full version, which costs a minimum of $139.99 (or $109.99 for the Word application alone).;
, Microsoft Office is available on a subscription basis, and you can get a free month's subscription by visiting the official Microsoft site. Click the green button that reads “Start your free month” to begin the process.


The trial month of Microsoft Office includes a full-featured suite of programs, plus some other perks like 60 minutes of free Skype calling time to any phone. If an update to the software is released during your trial, it will apply to your version of Office automatically.
 Like many subscription services, an Office subscription will start to cost you money every month (either $9.99 a month, or $99.99 at once for an entire year) if you don't cancel it before the trial ends. Make a note somewhere you'll see it, and be sure to cancel at least a full day ahead of schedule to avoid any complications.

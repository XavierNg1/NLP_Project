 Gently comb out any tangles, then blot your hair dry with a soft towel. Let your hair dry until it is damp. Do not apply serum or leave-in conditioner.
 Start at the neck and use a scissors to cut all the way down to the hem. Continue until you've made as many strips as possible from the body of the t-shirt.Discard the sleeves, since they're too short to make long hair strips.









Make the strips as wide as you want your curls to be. For tiny curls, make them 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) wide; for bigger, looser curls, make them up to 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) wide.
If you don't have an old t-shirt, you can use long socks, dish towels, other items of clothing, and even paper bags. Just make sure the length of the strips is a couple of inches longer than your hair.
 Use a comb to separate a small section of your hair from the rest. Line up the bottom of a t-shirt strip with the end of your hair. Roll your hair up toward your roots, keeping the t-shirt strip in place the whole time. When you've rolled your hair and the strip up to your scalp, tie the ends of the strip to hold the rolled hair in place.








If you only want to curl the ends of your hair, stop rolling halfway up your head and tie the strips at the place where you want the curls to stop.
Roll your hair under, rather than up, for curls that curve toward your neck rather than curls that bounce outward.
Secure your hair with a hair clip or bobby pin.
 Wait several hours or go to bed with your hair rolled into strips. When your hair is completely dry, untie the strips and loosen your hair.Do this gently if you want tight curls. For looser curls, run a wide-toothed comb through your hair to separate the curls into waves.

 The most common medical cause of regurgitation in cats is a disease or problem with the function of the esophagus. If your veterinarian finds that your cat has an obstruction or malformation in its esophagus, then they will suggest treatment options for your pet.Common causes of regurgitation associated with the esophagus include foreign body obstruction, strictures, vascular abnormalities, or tumors.
Tumors will likely need to be treated with surgery.
Antibiotics can be used to clear up some abnormalities that are caused by infections.
 There are some medications that can be given to cats that will reduce their regurgitation. Your veterinarian may prescribe one for your cat. Remember, however, that these medications will treat the symptoms but will not eliminate the underlying cause of the regurgitation.Medications that can by prescribed include cimetidine or any other anti-emetic drug that is approved for use in cats.
 When your cat regurgitates, it is possible that it will inhale some of the food and liquid into its lungs. If that happens, it could cause the cat to get a cough or even pneumonia. If your cat does develop a cough or pneumonia, these problems should be treated by a veterinarian.Treatment for pneumonia in cats usually includes giving it a broad spectrum antibiotic and antifungal or antiviral drugs. Additionally, your cat may need supportive care in for the form of oxygen, fluids, and nebulization, which keeps the lungs moist.

 If your municipality does not allow the use of water softening systems, or if you are simply considering other options, buy a salt-free water conditioner, often mistakenly referred to as a water softener. These scale-control devices can reduce scaling in pipes but they are not proven to remove calcium. Salt-free conditioners require much less maintenance than regular water softeners, cost less to run, and often yield a better return on investment., To soften water in your shower directly, buy a water softening shower head online or in hardware stores. These shower heads use replaceable filters to soften water as soon as you install them, and cost very little in comparison to larger water softeners. Read reviews online and be sure to choose a model that comes with a warranty., Aluminum sulfate can cause the minerals in hard water to clump and settle. To prepare soft water to wash with, add one tablespoon (0.5 oz.) of aluminum sulfate to a small bucket of water. Once the minerals have settled to the bottom, skim water off of the top with a small cup or bowl. Use it to wash your face, take a sponge bath, or rinse your hair.

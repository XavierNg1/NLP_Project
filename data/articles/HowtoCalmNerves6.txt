 Going for a run, doing some jumping-jacks, and lifting weights all help relieve stress by releasing endorphins—brain chemicals that elevate mood, beef up our body’s immune systems, and ease feelings of physical pain.Exercise also allows us to feel like we are in control of our situation, even though we may not be in control of things that cause us stress.
 Eating the right foods can not only make us feel good and satisfied, but can also help elevate our moods. When we are stressed our bodies secrete hormones that affect mood. Foods that contain vitamin B and folic acid help fight stress as those minerals are needed for the production of serotonin—our brain’s happy chemical. Try eating some of the following superfoods for a little mood boost:


Blueberries are high in vitamin C—a major stress-fighter. Try them in a smoothie, on top of some granola, or even on their own.
Gnawing on some raw almonds may help get some aggression out. They are also a rich source of vitamin B2 and E, which, like vitamin C has been shown to fight free radicals associated both with stress and disease.
Asparagus is high in both vitamin B and folic acid. This high-fiber green is great in salads and pastas, and makes a great side dish simply steamed with a squeeze of lemon and dash of salt., Dehydration can cause your body to function less productively, and it can increase the possibility of anxiety or even panic attacks. Consume 9-13 cups of fluids per day. Some of this fluid can be attained from fruits and vegetables with high water content., Your body needs time to restore itself and to allow muscles to fully relax. Getting enough sleep every night will fend off stress that leads to jangled nerves. Try for 7-8 hours of sleep every night.If you have trouble getting to sleep, try taking a warm bath before bed or listening to some calming music.

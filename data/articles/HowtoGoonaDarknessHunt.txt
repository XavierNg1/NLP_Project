 Is it because you can't see anything? What about the fact that something could be watching you?;
,, People can be awake, just tell them to go into a room, with the lights off and not talk for awhile.
 First, go through the house with the lights on, noting what you see and what you hear. Say you hear a ticking noise or a thumping noise. Look around for an explanation. Is the clicking the furnace turning on? Is the thumping your cat paying with a string? Once you have the sounds and explanations noted, you can really begin.
 Go through your house and keep the phone on you. The phone is there just in case you're convinced you hear an intruder. As you're walking through the house, listen for noises. Do you still hear that clicking noise and your heart begins to race? Remember: It's the Furnace! Your eyes go wide as a short, black object darts around a corner. Follow it! Chances are, it's your cat! Once you're sure of that, you can go up a level.
 Remember: You're passing the same things you did last time! The clicking; the furnace! The thumping; your cat! All these things are the same thing you saw/heard earlier!

, You're now ready for the dimmest flashlight yet! Go through your whole house again, noting what's different this time.
 NO cheating and turning the porch light on! It's fine if you bump into things. Don't freak out thinking you just ran into an armed intruder. If you feel like you're being watched, it may be your cat. Never think you're alone if there is a cat or a living thing in your house. Even if it's a fly, there is other life. To feel braver, think someone you look up to is watching! If you like Lady Gaga for example, pretend she is watching you. You will feel braver and stronger. Remember, all noises you hear are normal. What if you hear scratching at the window? Go over to it. See, it is just a branch! The dark isn't as bad as you thought!

, It will soon be very easy.

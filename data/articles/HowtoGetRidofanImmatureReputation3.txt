 Because it involves a group's shared opinion of you, reputation change will take time. If you find yourself struggling with patience as you work to change your reputation, remind yourself that your reputation isn't either mature or immature like a light switch is on or off, but is instead on a continuum that varies in maturity, like a light dimmer switch that goes from very bright all the way down to off., If you did something regretful that is contributing to your immature reputation, say sorry and mean it; this will help you repair your reputation.When you apologize, do not over do it. Focus instead on actively showing, through your improved behavior, how you will fix the situation you regret or otherwise avoid it in the future. In other words, when making an apology, don't just tell, also show that you are sorry. , It is possible that someone is leaking information about you that you do not want others to know. Find out who this individual is and ask them not to do so. If they are saying things about you that are inaccurate or entirely untrue, ask them why they are doing that, let them know it is damaging to you, and if they do not stop, seek outside guidance, such as from a parent or teacher. Let others know they are spreading false information about you.To figure out the source, try asking others who they heard particular information about you from.
 One drastic but effective way to change your reputation, which can be paired with your changing the behaviors you have identified as problematic, is to hit the reset button and change social groups entirely.By starting afresh, your reputation now has a clean slate and you can be seen as mature through your new found behaviors, thoughts, and emotions, more easily.

 Wash the sediment and dirt from your sorrel by immersing it in a tub of water. Run your fingers across the leaves to wash them before removing them from the water., Press down on the sorrel with paper towels and try to absorb as much moisture as you can.
 Folding the sorrel in half makes it easier for you to cut both sides of the stem.
 With the sorrel leaf folded, make an angled cut to take off the hard stem of the sorrel. The cut should run about two-thirds up the stem of each leaf., If you plan on preserving your sorrel for later use, wrap them in a damp paper towel and place them in your refrigerator. Sorrel will become soggy very quickly and will wilt in a day or two. Wrapping them with a damp paper towel will slow the speed at which the leaves turn brown and wilt.

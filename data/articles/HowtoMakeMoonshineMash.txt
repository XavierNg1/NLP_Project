 Place the pot on the stovetop, and heat the water to 120˚ F (48.9˚ C).


A large and sturdy outdoor stove may be used if indoor space is limited.;
, Pour the cornmeal in slowly, roughly 1 lb. (453.6 g) at a time. Stir occasionally to dissolve the cornmeal evenly.
 Stir in the sugar slowly, adding 1 lb. (453.6 g) at a time. Maintain the temperature of mixture between 120˚ and 145˚ F ( 48.9˚ and 62.8˚ C) for 30 minutes.


Avoid scorching the mash by maintaining recommended temperatures, otherwise too much heat will prevent starch from converting to sugar.
 Cool pot by carefully placing in sink or sturdy outdoor tub partially filled with cool water.
 The mash will begin to thicken as the fermentation process begins and the yeast consumes sugars to produce alcohol and carbon dioxide.You can add a small amount of warm water if you wish to thin out the thickened mash at this point.
 Place a thin cloth over the vessel to keep out insects, dirt or other undesirables, but allow for the introduction of wild yeasts and air circulation.


Fermentation requires oxygen and produces carbon dioxide so you don’t want to seal the vessel completely.
Alternatively, you can attach an airlock to the lid of the vessel, which will allow carbon dioxide to escape, but prevent contamination from the air.A foamy head will develop on top of the moonshine mash. When the froth stops growing the mash is ready for distillation.

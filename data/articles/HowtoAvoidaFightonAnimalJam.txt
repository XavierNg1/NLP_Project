 You are less likely to meet someone who is in the mood for a fight when it's less crowded.;
, Even though you're role playing an animal, there's no need to be on the offensive. Don't bite, scratch, or hurt anybody. That sort of behavior starts fights.
 Sarepia forest is a common fighting ground. Only visit it to buy flags, complete your journey book, and watch Sarepia theater videos. Do not linger there for any other reasons or you may end up in a fight.
 If someone tries to start a fight, ignore them. They are less powerful with you ignoring them. If they try over and over and it irritates you, go to your den, which should be a no-fight zone (see next).
 Here is how. Lock it up. That allows no strangers inside your den––only buddies.


Memorize the username of the fighter, just in case they try to come into your den by switching animals and buddying you. If they ask, decline their request!
If a buddy starts a fight with you, go to your den as usual. If they leave you alone, it's okay to keep them as a buddy but if they continue the fight in your den, unbuddy them.
 If they are a real life buddy on Animal Jam and they start a fight, unbuddy them for a bit, to allow the two of you to cool down. Then add them back. If they continue the fight when you add them back, get offline and ask them to please stop in real life.
 Everybody in warrior clans prepare for battle.


Warrior clans have a lot of fighting involved, and therefore should be avoided.
If you do get into a clan fight somehow, just switch lands or worlds.

 Classes will help you learn shorthand in a structured setting, and you will meet other students with whom you can practice and test your knowledge.
 If you prefer one-on-one training, a private tutor is a great option. Though it can be expensive, working with a tutor is one of the fastest ways to learn a skill because you will get immediate feedback on your mistakes.
 There are many shorthand courses available online, some of which are free of charge. Many of them include interactive elements like practice tests, chat rooms, and study rooms that will facilitate your learning experience. Search the internet to find a reputable website that suits your needs.
 This step is crucial, since learning shorthand depends so heavily on memorization. Whether you have decided to take an online course or use a private tutor, make sure you are practicing shorthand multiple times per week. If your class or tutoring session meet only once a week, devote time outside of class to practicing and studying.

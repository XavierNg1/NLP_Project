 Warm up your face with a cloth drenched in hot water. Wash it with an acne cleanser. Exfoliate, steam, tone, and make the facial mask. Mix honey and a banana and smear on your face. Leave it on for 15 minutes. Rinse it off with cold water and massage your skin after applying a moisturizer.
 Exercise every morning. Go on the elliptical for 30 minutes in the morning. Do 30 squats, 30 lunges, 30 seconds in a wall sit, 30 calf raises, 30 leg raises, 30 bicycle crunches, 30 crunches, 30 oblique crunches, 30 seconds in a 6-inch, 30 pushups, 30 tricep pushups, 30 side pushups, and any other exercises you want to do. Stretch out your muscles and drink 2 glasses of ice water.
 Exfoliate with a body brush before entering the shower. In the shower, use an exfoliating scrub. Wash with a body gel and a loofah. Rinse with cold water. When you get out, apply a moisturizing lotion. Get a massage machine or get a professional massage at least once every 3 months.
 To maintain that exercise routine, you will need to follow this meal plan. For breakfast, eat a small bowl of oatmeal, a spoon of peanut butter, a slice of cheese, and a glass of orange juice. For lunch, eat a half sandwich made of lettuce, meat, one slice of cheese, and no mayo. Also eat a bag of assorted raw veggies. You can also eat another piece of fruit. For dinner, eat whatever your parents cook, but in small portions. For your morning snack, eat 5 crackers. For your afternoon snack, eat 10 slices of dried fruit or a slice of turkey meat. For dessert, eat a small bowl of yogurt with peanut butter mixed in. By eating this diet, you should also do a sport daily in addition to the morning exercise.

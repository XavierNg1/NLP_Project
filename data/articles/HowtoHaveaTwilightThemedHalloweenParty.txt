 Your friends are coming, of course - but what about that new girl in your class you've seen poring over "New Moon"? The neighbours who you raced to the bookstore to buy "Breaking Dawn"? Ask them along too!;
, and a time. Then send out Twilight-themed invitations - you could photocopy one of the book covers, or print out pictures of the cast. Just be creative!

, You can get together some of your Twilighter friends and assign "characters". Girls can be Alice, Rosalie, Esme, Renesme or Bella; boys can choose between Edward, Carlisle, Emmett, Jasper and even the wolves. Or why not be the Volturi?

, Choose Debussy or something else classical, to go with the theme.
 Okay, real vampires don't eat, but you're not a real vampire, are you?! Get cranberry juice to drink as "blood", and, of course, anything with eggs in it - Bella's favourite food.
 Traditional skeletons and witch posters might not be suitable for a Twilight Halloween - go for a more creepy old mansion feeling with scene-setters, wall-hangers, cobwebs and chandeliers.
, When everyone has arrived, introduce one another - as your characters. (So not "Hi, I'm Katie Jones" - say "Hello, I'm Rosalie Hale", etc.)

, Good examples include pin the tail on the shape-shifter; Edward and Bella's wedding dance; "hunting" (hide some toy animals around the room, and have your friends search for them in the dark); The Volturi Are Coming (like wink-murder - but anyone who is killed has to shriek and "burn").
 Offer prizes for those with the most correct answers.

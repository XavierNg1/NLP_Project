 Each state has a department of insurance, commerce, or other agency that looks into allegations of health insurance fraud.This agency detects, investigates, and prevents insurance scams and fraudulent activity within your state.
 Once you determine which agency in your state investigates fraud, find out if they have a form or a hotline for reporting your suspicions anonymously.Insurance fraud agencies typically have phone numbers for citizens to call with tips about scams or suspicious activity.If you thought you bought health insurance, but now the company you bought the insurance from won't answer the phone and your medical bills aren't being paid, you may be the victim of a fraudulent health insurance scheme. These sort of fraudulent activities should be reported directly to your state's insurance fraud bureau., If you suspect a doctor or medical professional of engaging in fraudulent activities, you can report that to the state board in charge of licensing and discipline of medical professionals.Licensing boards handle problems involving the professional conduct of doctors and other licensed medical professionals. If a doctor is defrauding an insurance company, the board will file charges, conduct a hearing, and impose penalties if the doctor is found guilty., If your billing discrepancy or other fraud suspicions involve a hospital department or employee, you may be able to report your suspicions to a state association that regulates hospitals.The American Hospital Association website has a list of state, regional, and metropolitan hospital associations in the United States.

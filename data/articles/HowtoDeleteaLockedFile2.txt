 Turn off your computer, place the Windows reinstallation disc into the optical drive, and then turn the computer on. Windows will boot from the disc instead of the hard drive.
 Recovery Console is a troubleshooting application included with Windows. When the "Welcome to Setup" screen appears, press the "R" key to enter the application.
 When the Recovery Console loads, navigate to the locked file's location just as you would using the command prompt (using the instructions in the above section). After deleting the file using the "del" command, type "exit" to exit the Recovery Console and restart the computer.

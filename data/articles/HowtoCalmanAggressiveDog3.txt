 Both dogs and people can be sensitive to the others moods. If you sense a potential outburst, or if your dog is already displaying aggressive behavior, stay calm and respond quickly. Restrain your dog on their leash or grab their collar and redirect them if they start displaying aggressive behavior.Ask the individual to slowly back away and re-approach once your dog has calmed down.
 Standing in front of your dog and blocking them from approaching others will keep their aggression at bay. Your dog's line of vision will also be blocked, which may relieve them of their trigger entirely. Remember, you know your dog better than anyone else so it is your responsibility to mediate for them.If you have enrolled in behavioral classes use some commands or directives to relive your dog of tension.
 Many dogs are aggressive toward new people. Introducing them slowly will help your dog gradually become used to their presence and curb aggressive behavior. If you are trying to introduce your dog to someone specifically set up regular play dates where your dog can continually get used to the individual.


Have the individual slowly extend the back of their hand and offer it to your dog to smell. This will help them become familiar with the individual and will allow for them to approach your dog.

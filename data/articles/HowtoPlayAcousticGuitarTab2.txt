 If you see the "P.M." followed by a line over the top of the tab, this tells you to palm mute. Palm muting is when you place the fleshy part of your palm just over the strings, right at the bridge (far-right, for right-handed guitarists), so that your strings sound a little chunky and muted.









You palm mute all the notes underneath the P.M. line, then stop when it ends.
 This just means to play a dead string. To do so, use your fretting hand to dampen the string, not fretting a note but not letting it sound out openly either. When you pick it, it should have a percussive, "chick" sound instead of a clear note.
 There are two different types of bends in tablature. Professional tabs have a curved line, like the video, telling you to go up. A full-step means you bend the notes enough it sounds two frets higher -- a half-step is one fret higher.









You might also see a b, such as "A|------2b3------|." This means you bend the second fret up so it sounds like the third fret.
If you see a downward arrow after the bend or a "2br3," this is a "bend and release." Simply return to the first note, before the bend, after getting up.
 If you see a slash going from one note to the other, it means you need to slide from one note to the other. So, if you see "D|-----3/5-----|" it means you slide from the third fret to the fifth.









If there are parenthesis around a number, like "(3)/5," it means the note is a grace note. You want to be sliding off of it right when you pick it, so you never really hear the full 3rd fret.
There might also be a line above the tab, connecting all of the notes in the slide. This is called a "slur," telling you to play every note smoothly together.
 Hammer-ons and pull-offs are essential for speedy playing and are noted in two ways. First, a slur (or curved line above the numbers), tells you to play the notes smoothly together, hammering and pulling off for every note under the line. The other method is through an h and p for hammers and pull offs, respectively.









If you were to alternate two notes, it might look like: B|-----2h-4p-2h-------|


, Vibrato is simply a rapid, short bend back and forth over a note. Some professional tabs may even have thicker lines telling you how quickly to bend the note -- thicker lines mean more vibrato. It may also be noted by:









A "v" before or after a note.
A series of "~" in place of the normal hyphen between notes. Hold the vibrato as long as there are more 20:14, 15 February 2016 (GMT)~ in the tab.
 Most tabs don't use stroke indicators, which just tell you how to strum. However, there are some songs where this information is essential to get the right sound, and composers feel like they must add them. They will be above or below the actual tab. All it means is that, when you get to the note lined up with the indicator, you strum that note or chord the proper direction:









An upside-down "U" means you want to strum downward.
A "V" shape means you want to strum upwards., The best way to learn tab is to use it for songs you already know, helping you get used to the system -- not the song itself. Simply search online for "Song You Want to Play" + "Guitar Tab." Once you know tablature well, you can then use it to learn new songs. Try to practice on a classic -- like this riff from "Sweet Home Alabama.":E|-------------------------------------------------||

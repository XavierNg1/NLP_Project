 Vegetable dehydration is common with gardeners who like to preserve the excesses of their harvest for the winter months.;
, Use a mandoline or a meat slicer to achieve this easily. It is important to have uniform slices so that they take the same amount of time to dry.


Many vegetables need to be pre-processed in order to avoid a change of color. Steam broccoli, eggplant and carrots for a short time.
Blanche summer squash, cauliflower, potatoes, sweet potatoes or carrots until they are soft but still crisp. To blanche means to plunge something in boiling water for a few seconds or minutes, then put them on ice. This locks in enzymes and starches so it will contain the same enzymes and be nutritious when it is rehydrated. You do not need to pre-process zucchini. Spray lemon juice on carrots to keep the color.
 Dehydrate using temperatures between 130 and 145 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 63 degrees Celsius).


To create roasted flavors in your peppers, cut them in half, broil them until they start to blister, cool and then dehydrate them skin side down.
 Other vegetables will absorb the flavor if you dry them together.

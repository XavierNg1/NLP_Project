 Don't be afraid to take your time and decide carefully. Examine your married friends' hands when you're with them. If you start paying attention to people's Jewish wedding ring designs, you will probably get a clearer idea of what you want. You might even ask them where they got their rings.;
, According to Jewish tradition, a Jewish wedding ring should be solid all around, with no gems, and nothing cut out of it. Anything may be engraved on it on the outer band, as long as the band is solid (the inner band may not be engraved). This symbolizes the wholeness and eternity of one's commitment to one's spouse., Some popular verses from the Song of Songs that are in vogue right now are "Ani L'Dodi v'Dodi Li," which means, "I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine." This is a very beautiful statement of your love for your partner. Other phrases are things such as "Ze Dodi Veze Re'ei" (This is my beloved and this is my friend). Another is "Matzati Et She'ahava Nafshi" (I found, him (her) whom my soul loves). Also, from the Book of Ruth, "Ba'asher Telchi Elech" (Where you will go, I shall go)., Look at various wedding band designs to determine which ones you would like to purchase. Try it on, to see if the band or the inscriptions look good on your hand.

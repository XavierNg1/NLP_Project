 It should be in between the two cups of the bra. Generally clasps are plastic or metal pieces where one side fits down into the other side. When the clasp is flattened, it snaps in place and locks together.
 Lift the edges of the bra up and toward you so that the clasp unlocks. You should see the two metal or plastic pieces unsnap.
 Bras vary on which side of the clasp will go up and which will go down. If you find resistance when you pull one side up, try the other side. The two pieces should come apart so that the bra can be taken off.

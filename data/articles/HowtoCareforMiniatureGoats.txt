 Although they do not need as much space as their larger relatives, they do need at least 6 metres x 6 metres / 20 x 20 feet and should be fenced off to prevent roaming. In addition, keep the fencing at least 1.5 metres / 5 feet high to prevent predators entering, such as dogs or foxes.;
, Goats do not like being wet or windblown and should be given a good shelter to get out of the elements. Any small type of shelter should be suitable, provided that you allow enough room for the amount of goats you have. Keep the interior clean and use fresh straw as bedding inside.
 Good pasture is a priority and should be supplemented with hay, grain and vegetables.Keep hay feeders above the ground to prevent infection from parasites. You may also want to keep the grain in a large garbage can, preferably metal, as rats or mice may get into the grain.
 As with all animals, fresh water is important part of a daily diet.
 Miniature goats are very affectionate. They enjoy interacting with humans and are commonly found in zoos owing to their love of being around people and getting lots of pats! In particular, miniature goats enjoy being brushed.
 Trim hooves at least every four months.

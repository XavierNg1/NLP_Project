 While your hair is wet, add in some of your favorite styling product. Use something that will add moisture and help control frizz. The right choice for you will depend on your hair type and your individual preferences., To get a sleek look, you need to use the proper technique. Place a round brush under a small section of your hair and slowly pull it down towards the ends while you use your other hand to hold your blow dryer at an angle against the brush.

Pull the brush down straight. If you turn it, you will be creating new waves in your hair instead of blow drying it straight.
Be gentle when brushing, especially if you have tangles. You don't want to cause any damage to your hair!
Heat will help you achieve the sleekness you want, so set your hair dryer to medium or high heat.
 Wavy hair tends to get frizzy when allowed to dry naturally. If you want a sleek, straight look, you need to make sure you get it 100% dry.

If you don't want to subject your hair to this much blow drying, you can let it dry naturally for 10 to 15 minutes and then start blow drying. This will not cause frizz, as allowing your hair to naturally air dry all the way probably will., This is not required, but if you want some added sleekness, you can finish your look with a flat iron. Run it carefully over your strands, pulling them out and around your face to avoid making your hair totally flat.

If you want stick straight hair, just pull the flat iron straight down without angling it towards your face at all.

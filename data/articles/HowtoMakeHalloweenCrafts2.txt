 Tall, white candles quickly take on a creepy appearance when you melt a red candle or crayon over the flame, leaving trails of red "blood" running down the side., Take a large glass jar and glue a thin circle of Styrofoam in the underside of the lid. Stick twigs in the Styrofoam to make trees, and decorate with moss, grass, or stones. To make the ghost head, draw a face on a cotton ball or ball of paper about the size of your thumbnail. Wrap the head in cheesecloth or gauze and fold a rubber band at the ghost's neck. Let the rest of the gauze dangle down to make a spooky, drifting body. Stick the ghost on a twig and add a green LED light for maximum effect, then put the jar upside-down over the entire scene and tighten the lid.


You can cut out the Styrofoam circle from a Styrofoam cup or food tray. It should be thin enough that the lid can still attach to the jar.
 Scrub the label off any glass jar with soap and water, and fill it with water and a few drops of food coloring in any color. Leave some space in the jar so you can drop in seed pods, pine cones, or other small plant parts to create a laboratory of preserved specimens., A few black and orange pipe cleaners are all you need to make easy decorations. Try covering the front steps with spiders and worms. A dab of white glue and a couple googly eyes makes these little creations cuter.
 Start with a black paper or plastic plate, or color a white one black with markers. Drizzle white glue in a spiderweb pattern over the plate, then sprinkle glitter over the glue to make the web stand out.

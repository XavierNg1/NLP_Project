 Perhaps one of your children wants to watch one movie and your other child wants to see another. See if they can work together to come up with a movie that they both want to see. If not, allow one to see the movie they want and the other to pick the following week.Teaching your children how to compromise will be very useful to them later in life. It is an important life skill.
 The sibling relationship is one of the most important relationships that they will ever have. They are the only other people who have you as a parent and have the same upbringing. Long after you are gone, they will only have each other to remember their childhood and you as a parent. Remind them of this and encourage them to spend time together, bond, and get along. Having regular family time can be a good way to go about this. Go on family outings, camping trips, and visit theme parks. This will ensure time to create lasting memories and bonding experiences.
 In order to further affirm their individuality, give them their space. If possible, give them their own rooms. If not, then help them to establish boundaries in their room so that they can both enjoy and decorate their spaces., As siblings, it will be important for them to employ conflict resolution skills like taking turns, sharing, and communication. Step in when necessary to help them use these skills and then rely on them to continue their use later.Perhaps, though your children have differing personalities, they donâ€™t fight often. This is great, but you can still teach them these valuable skills.
 Though your children are different, they likely still have some similarities that they can draw upon to create fun memories and experiences together. Give them a monthly budget to use to do activities or go to events together. Encourage them to choose things that they both enjoy rather than taking turns deciding.


Avoid forcing your children to spend time together. They may not want to spend too much time together due to differences.

 Mix equal parts of water and vinegar in a spray bottle. Thoroughly spray the dented or flattened area of carpet. Make sure to cover the whole area with liquid, but don't saturate the carpet so that it’s soaking wet.Make sure the spray bottle is clean and free of other cleaners or chemicals before you use it.;
, Give the mixture time to work on the fibers of the carpet. Depending on how deep and flat the dents are, adjust how long you let the mixture work. Give it at least ten minutes, or wait about half an hour for deep impressions.


Vinegar is often used as a cleaning solution, so the area you spray may end up cleaner than the rest of your carpet.
 Grab a clean, white towel and gently press it into the wet carpet. Blot at the carpet until the majority of the liquid has been soaked up. Don’t press too hard or you’ll flatten the carpet out again.


It’s important to use a white towel so that you don’t bleed any color onto your carpet.
 Hold a spoon so the edge is against the area of carpet you’re fluffing. Pressing the spoon into the carpet, scrape it across the carpet in straight lines. This will cause the carpet fibers to spring up straight again.If a spoon doesn’t give you the results you hope for, try combing the carpet with the tines of a fork.
Also try a brush with stiff but non-metal bristles to even the carpet out when the dent is gone. A boar's hair brush works well.
 After you’ve fluffed the carpet, make sure you don’t walk on it before it is dry. Also be sure not to put any furniture back on the spot while it is wet. This could take 2-3 hours or more depending on the size of the area.

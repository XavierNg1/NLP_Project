 You can use any type of shampoo you want, but thicker shampoos work better. Choose a color and fragrance that you like.
 This will help make your slime thicker. Use equal amounts of shampoo and body wash. Stir the two together until there are no more streaks.








Make sure that your body wash and shampoo are similar colors, or your slime will end up muddy.
 There is no set amount for the salt, as each brand of shampoo reacts differently with it. Simply add in a pinch of salt, then give the slime a stir. Keep adding salt and stirring until the shampoo turns into a glob.
 Once you have your glob, place the bowl into the freezer. Leave it there for 15 minutes., Once the freezing time is up, the slime will have set and is ready to play with! When you are done playing with it, put it into an airtight container. You may need to re-freeze (15 minutes) it if it becomes too runny.

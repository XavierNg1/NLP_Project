 Create a new Excel spreadsheet. Click Insert on the top menu or ribbon menu, then Shape. Choose a rectangle, oval, or any other shape.
 Click and drag in the spreadsheet to "draw" the shape. To make it a perfect circle or square, hold down ⇧ Shift as you drag., Click on the lowest shape and type your name. Adjust the font size, color, and other styles if you would like before moving on to the next step.
 Select the shape you just drew and copy it with Ctrl+C (⌘ Cmd+C on a Mac). Paste as many copies as you need by pressing Ctrl+V repeatedly.
 Click and drag the shapes into a family tree layout. Typically, you would put one shape at the bottom of the sheet, two in a row above that, two more above each of them, etc. Click on each shape and type to write in the name of each relative.
 Return to the Insert Shapes menu and select a zig zag line. Click and drag in the spreadsheet to draw a line connecting a shape with the two shapes (parents) above it. As before, copy-paste to create new lines and drag them into position.
 If you like, you can include birth dates or notes below each name. You can either add this inside the shape itself, or click on spreadsheet cells right below each name and type the info there.

 It shouldn't look or sound like your camera's been run over by a truck! If you are planning on making videos such as a webkinz Pool Party, you may want to invest in a good underwater camera. You can also use your phone's camera, if it has good sound and video quality.;
, Why would we be kinztubers without the webkinz? Most kinztubers don't show their faces, and are represented by their webkinz, so pick your favorites!

, If it is, make your voice a little softer! It doesn't have to be really high-pitched! You want to sound happy and definitely not bored.
 No one wants to watch videos of endless talking. Do an original stunt or an experiment! Some people make videos of their webkinz when they go to the store or the park.

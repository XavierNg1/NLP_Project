 Just because a wedding is outdoors, keep in mind that it is still a very important event. It is better to be overdressed than underdressed for such an occasion, especially as you will likely be photographed.If choosing between a knee-length dress or floor-length gown, go for the gown. If you are torn between loafers and dress shoes, go for the dressier and more formal shoes.
 Do not show up wearing jeans, sneakers, shorts, or a T-shirt. Remember that this is a family event, so choose a classy and dignified look instead of a scandalous one. Never wear white to a wedding, as you do not want to steal the bride or groom's show., Not only will this give you a more relaxed and sophisticated vibe, but it will also make dancing much easier.There is no need to overdo your look with a hat or armful of bracelets. Go for the simplest options, as this will allow you more freedom and comfort.

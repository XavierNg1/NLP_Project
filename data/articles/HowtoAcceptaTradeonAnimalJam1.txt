 Everyone will want them and you will get lots of trades, but don't put items on your trade list that you want to keep. Putting items on trade that you want to keep causes problems as people may want that item and you're declining their trade. People will become very annoyed with you -- especially if the item they are trading is good. Don't put items that you can buy from Jam Mart on trade as they are accessible by everyone.;
, Say something along the lines of, "Trade me, I have amazing items on my trade list!" Be sure to dance, hop or play in a nice spot where everyone can click your name tag. This will get people's attention, and draw them to you.
 If you want the items they are offering, press OK âœ“, and if you don't want the items they are offering, press No X. After clicking one of the options, another window will appear and ask if you are really sure that you want to accept or decline this trade.
 If you trade a lot, you will get lots of items!

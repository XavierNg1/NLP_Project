 This ensures that there is no additional grease, dirt, or grit to further damage your car's finish. Use soap to break up grease that is not water soluble.;
,, This will help prevent debris from getting onto your existing paint, and also helps protect the paint from overzealous sanding.
 If you're using sandpaper, push only with your index finger. If you're using a sanding sponge, or block, then only use a corner. Use moderate and controlled pressure. The goal is to remove the rust, not damage the metal underneath.
 Don't sand away metal or paint unless it is necessary to remove the rust.
, If you still see rust, repeat sanding and wiping until the rust is gone. If you wind up with uneven spots or even holes in your metal, consider applying auto body putty to even out the area. Let the putty dry. Sand until smooth and the entire area is even.
, Exposed bare metal will only rust again, so don't skip this step or you'll be back where you started in a few weeks.
 Now you're ready to move onto the next rusty spot on your car, or begin painting the car so your repair can truly look "as good as new".

 If you see or hear domestic violence, then you should call 9-1-1 to report it immediately.You may state that you are reporting the violence anonymously and withhold your name.


Do not give your name or any other identifying characteristics. If someone on the other end asks how you know violence is occurring, say, “I heard it.” Don’t say, “I live next door and can hear it.” That detail can give away your identity.
Instead, simply state the address, details of the abuse, and a description of the abuse you witnessed.;
, The National Domestic Violence Hotline is free and confidential. They can connect you with local programs and national resources that may be able to help you.


To reach the hotline, call 1-800-799-7233. It is available 24 hours.
 If you have reported domestic violence anonymously and the victim continues to stay with the abuser, you may want to introduce yourself. When the abuser is away, stop by with a gift of some sort and introduce yourself. Ask if you can visit. As you talk, try to raise the issue of abuse in a kind manner.You might want to bring pamphlets or phone numbers for domestic violence shelters or hotlines to share.If you are scared of the abuser, then refrain from telling the victim that you were the one to call the police earlier.
 If you are being abused, you can seek a restraining order. If you know of someone who is abused, then you may help them get the restraining order. The order will command the abuser to stay away from the victim and not make any contact.Any violation can result in getting picked up by the police and potentially held in contempt of court.


To get a restraining order, you will need to go to your county court and ask for forms. There should be no charge for filing the forms.

 A problem involving a monomial and a binomial will involve one polynomial that only has a single term. The second polynomial will have two terms, which will be separated by either a plus sign or a minus sign.


A polynomial problem involving a monomial and a binomial will look something like: (ax) * (bx + cy)

Example: (2x)(3x + 4y)

, Rewrite the problem so that all the terms are separate by distributing the single-term polynomial to both terms in the two-term polynomial.


After this step, the new rewritten form will look something like: (ax * bx) + (ax * cy)

Example: (2x)(3x + 4y) = (2x)(3x) + (2x)(4y)

, The constants refer to the numerical digits in the problem. These are multiplied as they usually would be according to the standard times table.


In other words, during this part of the problem, you are multiplying a, b, and c together.
Example: (2x)(3x + 4y) = (2x)(3x) + (2x)(4y) = 6(x)(x) + 8(x)(y)

, The variables refer to the letters in the equation. When you multiply these variables, different variables will simply be combined together. When you multiply a variable by a like variable, though, you raise that variable by another power.


In other words, you are multiplying the the x and y portions of the equation.
Example: (2x)(3x + 4y) = (2x)(3x) + (2x)(4y) = 6(x)(x) + 8(x)(y) = 6x^2 + 8xy

, This type of polynomial problem is also simple enough to usually avoid the need for combining like terms.


The result will look something like: abx^2 + acxy

Example: 6x^2 + 8xy

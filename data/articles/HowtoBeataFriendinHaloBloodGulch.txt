 Do it as quickly as possible.;
, Standing still or walking in a straight line makes you an easy target to a player with any level of skill.
 They can be extremely powerful, but you can easily be sniped so I would be careful.


A banshee is not recommended if your opponent has a tank, as unless you are an exceptional flyer you will be an easy target. If you are using the banshee, when you are trying to splatter them watch out for people with rockets or nades.
 Don't stop firing the machine gun because it has unlimited ammo. Aim carefully at your enemy and fire the main gun. It should kill in one shot.
 If you only it's back to the enemy you are no longer a sniper target and can kill them easily.
, Use the hilly terrain to your advantage. Try not to get trapped in a corner of your base.
 There is also an overshield inside the cave along with a flamethrower, so if you are doing slayer or infection hide in there.

 Olive oil makes up the base of this all natural nail polish. Heat up three tablespoons over low heat in a small pan.








The oil just needs to be slightly warm, not hot. Remove it from the heat once it is warm.
 Charcoal can provide the color for your natural black nail polish or you can also use some natural black eye shadow, if you have some. Stir the charcoal or eye shadow into the olive oil until they are well combined.









You can also use ½ teaspoon of alkanet powder if you want to make a natural red nail polish. If the charcoal or eyeshadow does not fully dissolve in the olive oil, then you may want to strain the mixture through a cheese cloth to prevent a gritty texture. However, if the powder seems to have fully dissolved, then you can skip straining it.
 Beeswax will help to ensure that your nail polish will stay put on your nails. Stir ¼ teaspoon of beeswax into the olive oil mixture and return to the heat for a few minutes until the beeswax melts.
 Finally, you can finish up your natural nail polish by adding a few drops of vitamin E oil from a vitamin E capsule. This will add some extra moisturizing properties to the nail polish.Puncture a vitamin E capsule with a pin and then add a few drops to the other ingredients.









Stir the vitamin E oil in with the other ingredients until well combined.
 It may not be as black as traditional nail polish, but it is much easier on your nails.


Wipe away any of the natural polish right away if it gets on your skin. It may stain your skin.

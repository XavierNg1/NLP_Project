 Learn to recognize signs of flare ups. If you start to feel ill, try to figure out what is causing it (sun? stress? working too hard?) so that you can avoid it. Also, if you recognize that you are having a flare, you can tell your doctor so that it gets under control before it gets out of hand.
 If you have questions or concerns, call your doctor. Don't worry about "bothering them over something minor", you have a serious illness and it's their job to help you with your health. It is better to ask too often than not enough.

 It is common that people have a hard time understanding that you are ill. Try to educate them about lupus. Send them a link to a lupus website or give them a book about lupus to read.

 The regional offices do run different deals for seniors or military personnel at certain times of the year.


Some regions or states may partner with Comcast to provide you with a discount if you meet certain eligibility criteria.
 If you are purchasing services from Comcast on their website, you can enter coupon codes at the time of checkout to receive various discounts.


Perform an Internet search using keywords such as "Comcast coupon codes" to locate websites with valid coupon codes. You can also visit the "Retail Me Not" website featured in the Sources section of this article to review a list of Comcast coupon codes that provide various discounts.
Beware some of these "coupon" sites. Many are really just advertisements for companies, and the "special" offers are no different than those available directly through the company.
 In particular, look for things such as back-to-school deals, holiday promotions, and anything tied to an event throughout the year. August is moving season for many people, and so that is another great time to look for deals that Comcast is running for the higher than average number of people moving during that time. They have typically run summer deals on one portion of the company website.

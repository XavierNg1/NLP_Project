 Collies come in two different varieties, the Rough Collie and the Smooth Collie. The coat of the Smooth Collie is short, dense and flat. The Rough Collie has a long, well-fitted coat that feels a bit more harsh. The Rough Collie has a thick long coat all over it body, save its head and legs.Both varieties have a soft, profuse undercoat.
Keep in mind in the United States, many breeders will cross the two varieties together. But in England, the two varieties are considered separate breeds and cannot be interbred., Collies are known for the distinct coloring on their coats. There are four different colorings, with the most common being the sable color. The sable coloring can range from light golden tan to dark mahogany.The second most common coloring is the tricolor, which is a mix of black, white, and tan. The third most common coloring is Blue Merle, which can range from a pale, silvery blue to a darker gray, with or without black body spots.
The fourth most common coloring is white. A white Collie may have a body that is mostly white, with tricolor or blue markings, usually on their head.
 Nearly all Collies, no matter the variety or coloring, will have certain breed markings on their coat. They will have a white collar, chest, legs, feet, and tail tip. They may also have facial markings that are white, called a blaze.

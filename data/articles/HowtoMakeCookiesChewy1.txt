 Adding a tablespoon of molasses (21g) to your cookie dough will increase the cookies’ moisture content, giving them a soft, chewy texture. If you’re not fond of molasses’ deep flavor, try a tablespoon of honey.Don’t add multiple tablespoons of liquid sweetener like the ones listed because they will make your cookies runny and too sweet. One tablespoon is enough to make your cookies softer but not disrupt the integrity of the dough.;
, Brown sugar is more moist than white sugar, so using it gives a chewier result. Replace the white sugar in your recipe 1-1 with brown sugar. This will also give your cookies a deeper, more caramelized flavor., Butter contains fat, milk solids and water, whereas shortening is 100% pure fat. Using butter in cookies (due to the water) actually creates steam during the baking process, drying your cookies slightly. Shortening will create a chewier, more tender result. If you want to replace butter with shortening in a recipe, do so with a 1-1 ratio., This means that for each egg a recipe calls for, you would use two yolks instead. Yolks have more fat than egg whites, increasing the fat content of your cookies and keeping them moist., Baking powder is more acidic than baking soda, which means your cookies will spread less. This will prevent excess moisture loss as the cookie thins.

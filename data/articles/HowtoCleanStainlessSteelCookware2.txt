 Heat your stainless steel pan on the burner over a medium-high heat, until the pan is very hot. This should only take about 1 to 2 minutes.
 Once the pan is very hot, take it off the burner and add a tablespoon of oil (olive, coconut, peanut - whichever you prefer) and swirl it around the pan until the fat melts.
 Continue to heat the oil until it begins to smoke. As the pan heats and the oil melts, the molecules on the surface of the stainless steel will expand and the fat from the oil will become embedded into the pan, thereby coating the pan with a non-stick surface.
 Once the pan begins to smoke, turn off the heat and allow the oil to cool completely. Once the oil has cooled and the surface of the pan becomes reflective and mirror-like, the pan has been properly seasoned.
 When the pan is seasoned, pour the cooled oil off the pan into a jar or cup. Wipe any excess oil from the surface of the pan using some paper towel.
 As long as you do not wash your pan with dish soap, the non-stick surface should last for some time. You will still need to use a little extra oil when cooking though, to prevent the existing oil from burning.








Once the surface of the pan begins to turn brown or yellow, you can re-season the pan using the same method.

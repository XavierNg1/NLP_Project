 You will need the following:Cherries.
A knife.
A cutting board.;
, If there are any bruises, splits, or patches of mold then dispose of it and pick another one. If it is fine then continue.


Wash the cherries in water that is roughly 10 degrees (Fahrenheit) above room temperature in order to prevent damage to the fruit., On every cherry there will be a little line that is shaped a bit like a small valley. We will call this "the mark". Place the cherry mark side up on the chopping board.
 Stop when you hit the pit.
 You should end where you began, making a straight cut along the mark and around the other side. Gently twist both sections until they come off from the pit.
 Repeat the process until you have as many cherries as desired.

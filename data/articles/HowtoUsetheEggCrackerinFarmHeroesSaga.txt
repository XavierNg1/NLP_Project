 The eggs will appear together with the other cropsies. The Egg Cracker booster can be accessed from the top right corner, together with the other boosters., Tap or click the Egg Cracker booster from the top right corner. The button has a cracked egg icon on it. The booster is not unlimited, and the number of it you have is clearly indicated on the button.
 The booster will pass through the whole board cracking all the eggs on it. The eggs can’t be hatched by this though, as they need to be cracked several times then matched before getting the creature inside. You can use the Egg Cracker multiple times in a game, as long as you have it.
 Cracked eggs can be matched in groups of at least three before you can get the creature inside them. Once you’ve matched three or more cracked egg, a chick or dragon (depending on the egg) will pop out.

The button has a cracked egg icon on it. A window will appear with the chosen booster and its corresponding price in gold bars. Tap or click the “Buy” button to buy the booster.

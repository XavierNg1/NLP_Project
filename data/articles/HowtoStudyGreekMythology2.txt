 If you are not already in a class studying mythology, you can try taking one at the nearest university or community college. Greek mythology is a popular course, and many colleges offer it in both the spring and fall semesters, as well as over the summer. Courses typically cost from $100 at community colleges to over $1000 at universities. In the U.S., senior citizens can often take classes for free at community colleges.
 If you cannot make it to a university to class, you can take a course online instead. Many universities offer online courses, while you can also find them offered by for profit companies or even for free.



University courses – Universities such as Oxford, Duke, Brown, Harvard, and Yale offer online courses on Greek myths and heroes. Some of these, such as Harvard Professor Nagy’s course “Concepts of the Hero in Greek Civilization” are offered for free. Nagy’s course is available at http://kleos.chs.harvard.edu/?p=220.

Paid Online Courses – The most well-known series of for-profit courses online are offered by The Great Courses at www.thegreatcourses.com.

Free Online Courses – There are a variety of sites that bring together free mythology courses from across the web, including www.mooc-list.com (for courses from the Massive Open Online Course project) and oedb.org (Open Education Database).

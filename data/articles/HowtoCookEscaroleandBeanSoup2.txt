 Pour 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of olive oil into a saucepan. Turn the heat up to medium and let the oil get hot. Cut the pancetta into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) cubes and add it to the pot. Sauté it for 5 minutes.If you can't find any pancetta, you can use prosciutto instead.
 Use a slotted spoon to remove the pancetta from the saucepan. Set the pancetta aside on a plate. Leave the oil in the saucepan., Chop up the onion and add it to the saucepan. Sauté it until it turns golden in color. This will take about 10 minutes., Continue sautéing for 3 more minutes. If you can't find any rosemary, you can use thyme instead., Continue cooking everything for 2 minutes. Stir the mixture often with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula., Give the mixture a good stir, then bring it to a boil over medium to medium-high heat. It is best if you use vine-ripened tomatoes. If you can't find any, use chopped canned plum tomatoes instead; be sure to drain them first, however., As soon as the soup comes to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer over low heat. Cover the saucepan with a lid. Allow the soup to cook for 10 to 15 minutes., Once the soup is done heating, take it off of the stove. Stir in the sautéed pancetta. Give the soup a taste, then add some more salt and pepper, if needed., ladle the soup into serving bowls. Top each soup with 2 teaspoons of extra-virgin olive oil. If you want to, add a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese. Serve some crusty bread on the side, if desired.

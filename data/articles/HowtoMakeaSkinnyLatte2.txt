 Add ½ cup (118 ml) of non-fat milk to a jar that has a lid. Close the lid, and shake the jar vigorously until the milk becomes frothy and doubles in volume, which should take approximately 30 to 60 seconds.Make sure that the lid is on the jar tightly before you shake it so you don’t wind up spilling milk all over your kitchen.
 Once the milk is frothy, remove the lid from the jar and place it in the microwave. Heat it on high for 30 seconds.In addition to warming the milk, the heat from the microwave helps stabilize the foam.
 Fill a wide, shallow coffee mug with approximately 1 cup (237 ml) of hot espresso. Pour as much of the milk into the espresso as you’d like, using a large spoon to hold back the foam.Lattes are traditionally made with espresso, but if you don’t have an espresso machine or moka pot, you can make an extremely strong cup of regular coffee to use.
 Once the espresso and milk are combined, use the spoon to add some of the milk foam to the top of the latte. You can also garnish it with ground cinnamon or nutmeg for added flavor.

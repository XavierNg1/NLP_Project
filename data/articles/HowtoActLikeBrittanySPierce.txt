 Brittany's act is totally innocent. She's so clueless to everything around her. Be somewhat innocent, speak softly, laugh softly, even sneeze cute.;
, Brittany excepts everybody, and in return everybody loves her back! Who wouldn't love her?

, Brittany's passion is to sing and dance. She's also on the Cheerios. Try to get on your cheerleading team, or take dance classes. Bonus if you join show choir!

, Brittany occasionally states the world is going to end, or something's gonna happen. When it's over, (and nothing had happened), it'll be a cute mistake, just say "oops!" throw in a cute giggle.
 One liners are important. Brittany's are the absolute best. Weird ones, but with a hint of cute. Like, "My cat's been reading my diary" or " I get my information from Woody Woodpecker cartoons" Those are just some famous one liners. Make your own!

, When Brit wasn't on the Cheerios, she made some serious trends. Show people that you can work the most odd things. Like, leg warmers on your arms.
 Also try to get a pet, just like Brittany. It doesn't have to be cat, his name doesn't have to be Lord Tubbington, and he can be a she. Just be close to your pet, but claim your pet smokes, or is in a gang.

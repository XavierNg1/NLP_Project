 While heat alone probably won’t completely destroy data, turning your platters into liquid piles of molten goo is pretty effective. This will be particularly fun if you’re the sort of person that the local fire department knows by name. Whatever method you choose, make sure you’re doing it in an area with some pretty serious ventilation, because a melting hard drive will give off fumes that can possibly kill you.


Use a standard fire. Be it in a fireplace or hobo barrel (preferably the latter), you may be able to get a normal fire hot enough to liquify your hard drive. Toss it on and leave it because it’s probably going to take a while. Fun level: 3
Use a blow torch. Put on some protective gear, hold the platters at a distance with some kind of heat resistant tool, and watch it melt. Make sure the floor below can take a beating. Fun level: 5
Use thermite. For the more adventurous hard drive destroyer, you can seriously overkill the task by filling a large container with sand, placing the platters on the sand, and then lighting a container of thermite over the platters. This is science at it’s best and creates a chemical reaction which produces a lot of heat and a small explosion, so be really careful. Do not use this method indoors. Or near a forest. Or near small children. Or near yourself, really. Fun level: 11
Use sugar and saltpeter. Mix sugar and saltpeter in a soda can and place it over a hard disk in a bucket of sand. This is basically a small bomb, so be really, really careful about where you set it off and where you’re standing when it goes off. Fun level: 11

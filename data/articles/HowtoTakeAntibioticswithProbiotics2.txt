 Prebiotics contain a type of soluble fiber that bacteria can digest. Prebiotics often contain inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), which are present in many prebiotic supplements as well. Eat one type of prebiotic food every day and you should get enough prebiotics in your diet without the need to use supplements. Foods that are high in prebiotics include:Chicory root
Jerusalem artichoke
Dandelion greens
Garlic
Leeks
Asparagus
Wheat bran
Baked wheat flour bread
Banana

, You should eat vegetables every day, especially leafy green vegetables. These vegetables support the growth of healthy bacteria. They contain substances that bacteria use to produce anti-inflammatory substances and may even help prevent cancer. Include cruciferous vegetables such as:Broccoli
Brussels sprouts
Cabbage
Cauliflower.
Kale
Spinach
Swiss chard
Greens from mustard, collard, beet, and turnip plants

, Beans contain lots of fiber, but they also release short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). These SCFA strengthen and support gut bacteria. The SCFA also support the lining of your gut and improve the absorption of many nutrients. They may also help with weight loss.Include beans in your meals three to four times a week at a minimum.
 Some types of foods contain prebiotics and probiotics. Try to get four to six servings of these foods every week. These foods include:Sauerkraut
Kefir
Yogurt
Aged cheeses such as Roquefort, Bleu, Brie, Feta and Gruy√©re.
Curtido (a fermented salsa)
Kombucha
Kimchee
Pickles fermented in brine

, Diets high in certain types of foods can harm the gut bacteria and alter the numbers and types of bacteria in the gut. Evidence is growing that this sort of alteration of the gut bacteria, often called dysbiosis, may lead to all sorts of health issues.Foods to avoid include:


Animal fat
Antibiotic-fed meat and poultry
Sugar
Processed and packaged foods that include additives, preservatives, and sugar

 Cydia apps cannot be uninstalled like traditional App Store apps. The quickest way to uninstall apps that have been installed with Cydia is to delete them through Cydia's package manager. To do this, you will need to open the Cydia app from your Home Screen.


See the next section if Cydia will not open.;
, This is located on the bottom toolbar. Tapping the "Manage" button will open a menu with three options: Packages, Sources, and Storage.
 This will open Cydia's package manager, where you can add or remove programs, or "packages", from your iPhone or iPad.
 You will be shown a list of all your installed Cydia packages in alphabetical order. Scroll through the list until you find the program that you want to uninstall, and then tap it to open the details.
 This will open a small menu that allows you to Reinstall or Remove the package.
 You will be taken to a Confirm screen. Tap the "Confirm" button in the upper-right corner to remove the package. If you want to delete multiple programs at once, tap the "Continue Queuing" button and add more packages to the Remove queue using the steps above. When you are finished building the list, tap the "Confirm" button to remove all of them at once.

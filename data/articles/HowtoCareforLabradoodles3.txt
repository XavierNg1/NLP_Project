 Your Labradoodle needs high quality food to be healthy and happy. Look at the labels of the dog food you buy him. The first two ingredients should be meat and vegetables to ensure that it is a high quality food. Make sure to avoid food with meat by-products in the first few ingredients.If you aren’t sure which brands to feed your dog, ask your vet.
 Since your Labradoodle is more prone to conditions that can cause arthritis, be more conscious about how much you feed him. If he gets overweight, his bones will have undue stress on them, which may make these conditions more possible. Look on the back of his food bag or can to see the serving suggestions for his weight.


You should also avoid feeding him too many treats throughout the day. The calories in them can add up over time and cause him to gain weight.If you want to reward him, try baby carrots or canned, no salt added green beans.
 If you aren’t happy with the commercial food you find for your Labradoodle, think about a raw diet. This is a diet you make yourself at home. Never start this diet without first consulting your vet and an animal nutrition expert. Your Labradoodle has specific nutritional needs that will not be met if you aren’t aware of how to balance his diet, which can lead to serious illness.


There are some web resources that have many different raw dog food recipes created by nutritionists, but always ask your animal nutritionist or vet first.

 To make a simple, creamy eyeshadow using all natural colors and ingredients you will need:


Arrowroot powder and refined shea butter -- these ingredients form the base of the eyeshadow.
Naturals coloring agents -- depending on what color eyeshadow you want, you can use cocoa powder, turmeric, dried beet powder, allspice or nutmeg.
 Depending on the quantity of eyeshadow you want, place 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of arrowroot powder in a small bowl.









Add your chosen coloring agent (the exact quantity will depend on how deep you want the color to be) and mix with the arrowroot powder until you achieve an even, consistent color.
Add the shea butter to the bowl and use the back of a spoon to cream the powder and shea butter together until soft and creamy.
Transfer the eyeshadow to an empty lip balm container and tightly replace the lid.
 Although each of the coloring agents described above will create a pretty eyeshadow on its own, you should also try experimenting with mixing different colors to create an eyeshadow with more depth.


Mix cocoa powder and dried beet powder to make a pretty pale pink eyeshadow.
Mix allspice, cocoa powder and dried beet powder to create a deep mauve colored eyeshadow.
Mix nutmeg and turmeric to create a warm golden brown color.

 Food is important for the survival games. Loot chests for food and if you're lucky enough, you'll find some food. If players are nice, they might even give you some food! Some great food is cake, mushroom stew, pumpkin pie, steak, and beef. You can eat cake numerous times and they refill your hunger quickly. Mushroom stew is really easy to make in survival games. Pumpkin pie does a huge refill on your hunger. Steak and beef also add food to your hunger bar.
 Plan your kill so that you don't end up being killed. For example, you can devise a plan to sneak up on them or hit them all the way until they're at a cliff and eventually fall to their doom.
 A great way to progress in the survival games is to ally with someone that won't stab you in the back. Give a peace signal and offer something generous showing that you want to team. Or type in 'Team ?' in the chat and see if they say anything back. Also, once you have a team, let them give you gear and if you get a chance kill them(if it is a team of 4 or more, do not try to kill them).
 At some point of the game, the chests will refilled with all sorts of new treasure and goods. Run back to the center and browse the chests for items that are important and essential and who knows? You might find some diamond!

, If you find some wheat you want to craft into bread, head to the center and craft it! You can be able to craft a diamond sword also and fight off the remaining!

, You might come across a lever and then flip it. The lever would activate and it would be bad.

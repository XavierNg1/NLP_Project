 You can go to any drugstore and buy a blood sugar testing kit. Most kits contain lancets (testing needles), a lancing device, testing strips, and a meter to read the results.


Many insurance companies will pay for your meter and test strips if you obtain a prescription from your doctor.;
, Familiarize yourself with all the functions of your blood glucose meter, how much blood is required for testing, where you insert your test strip, and where the readout will be. Look at the pictures and read the instructions thoroughly, and if you have any questions or concerns then contact your doctor before trying to use the machine.
 Most glucometers include a way to test to make sure they are reading correctly. This could be in the form of a premade test strip or a liquid you place on a test strip. These are inserted into the machine and the reading should be within acceptable limits, which the instruction manual will provide.

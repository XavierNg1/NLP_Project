 Playing with a stuffed animal is entertaining.
 Give your toy lots of play time so they don't get bored.
 Read them stories, watch movies with them, share meals, etc. Also, don't forget, even stuffed animals are a little afraid of the dark, so they might want to cuddle with you at night.
 Your friends most likely have some stuffed animals, too, so your toy can make some new friends at a party.

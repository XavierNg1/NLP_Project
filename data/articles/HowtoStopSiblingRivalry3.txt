 Children need to be taught what will be tolerated and what will not. Avoid straying from what constitutes a broken rule as much as possible. Children learn early on how to manipulate and are great at twisting words to benefit themselves.
 Children will test how far they can push the limits so expect some resistance and stand firm.
 All actions do not warrant the same consequences but children can easily learn what to expect from different actions.
 It is often difficult to determine who is to blame for an incident because generally those involved are all to blame to some degree. Once a rule has been broken, always enforce the consequences.
 Age differences should be taken into consideration sometimes. Chastising a 10 year old with the same consequences given to a 3 year old is just not practical.

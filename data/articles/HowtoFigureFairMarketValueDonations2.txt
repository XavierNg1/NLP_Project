 The Internet has numerous used-car valuation guides that you can use to determine the fair market value for most cars. There are also several printed car valuation guides that you may find in the reference section of your local library. Select one guide, or try several different sources, to compare the assigned values for your vehicle. One of the most popular and universally referenced guides is the Kelley Blue Book (or KBB).
 Used-car valuation guides, whether online or in print, are organized by car make and model and listed by year. Find the exact match to the car that you are donating.
 Valuation guides generally provide a range of values, from low to high. Lower the fair market value if your donated vehicle has higher than average mileage or is in poor condition. You should also discount the fair market value if the vehicle is not operational, has damage to the exterior or interior, or has excessive wear on tires or other parts. , In order to claim a donation of more than $500 for a single vehicle, you must obtain a written acknowledgment from the donee organization at the time of your donation. This written statement must include a description of the car and the valuation agreed to by the organization. You will need to attach this acknowledgment to your tax return. , When you submit your tax return, you are eligible to deduct either the agreed value of the car as shown in the doneeâ€™s acknowledgment statement, or the amount that the donee later gets when reselling the car, whichever is lower. If the car is not sold but is used by the charitable organization, you may deduct the estimated fair market value.
If the value of the vehicle is $500 or less, you do not need to deduct a sales price. You can deduct the estimated fair market value.

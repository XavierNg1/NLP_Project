 You need something to act as the drum body. If you want a temporary solution because you're making the drum for a small child, use something like a metal soup pot (two handles instead of a one handled saucepan). If you want a drum for an older child or something that your child can have for a longer period of time, you can use PVC pipe or a cardboard shipping tube (both will need to be cut to size).
 You'll need balloons in a few different sizes, because the opening of your drum body will be different and you don't know what will really make the best sound until you try it. Once you have the balloons, cut off the necks., Stretch the balloon over the opening of the pot or drum body. This will probably be challenging, but don't give up. Try different balloons to get different sounds during this part of the process.
 Using a strong tape, like duct tape, tape the edges of the balloon to the side of the drum, helping to hold it in place. Make sure there are no air leaks.
 Enjoy your new drum!

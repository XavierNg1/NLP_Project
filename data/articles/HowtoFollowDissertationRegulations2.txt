 Your university will have created very specific (and unbreakable) guidelines for formatting your dissertation. This will include specifics about margin size, font size, acceptable font, the way figures or images are titled, numbering and pagination, order of front matter (approval page, table of contents, acknowledgements, etc.), and other specifics. You must first determine all of these specific requirements. Search on your university’s website or speak to your dissertation advisor to obtain this information., Once you are aware of the specific guidelines for formatting your manuscript, begin moving down them one by one. It is a really good idea to familiarize yourself with these requirements before you even begin writing, and to start your document with the right dimensions, font, etc. from the beginning. If you have not done this, that’s OK. Simply move down your list of formatting rules and make changes where you need to., Most schools will have individuals who work as “thesis or dissertation reviewers.” You can make an appointment with one of these people and they will sit down with you to make sure that your dissertation is formatted in the proper way. Some of the guidelines can be confusing (especially in regard to pagination), so it is a great idea to seek out this resource and take advantage of it at your school.Be sure to bring in a formatted version of your dissertation!
Do your best on your own, and then head to your appointment with questions.

 Place it in the fridge, or better yet, submerge it for an hour or two in a wine bucket with plenty of ice and a little bit of water.;
, Polish with a tea towel (dish towel) or linen napkin to remove any water marks and dust. Milk is your worst enemy for fizzy drinks so make sure you never use milk in your champagne flutes or glasses, or wash it in water where milky substances have already been washed.
 White linen napkins look best but may not capture your drips as easy as a soft tea towel. This prevents the ice water or condensation from dripping and also makes the bottle easier to hold with one hand if you choose to do so.
 Make sure to keep a hand on top of the cork as they can 'pop' prematurely.


Gently twist the bottle to ease the cork from the bottle. The bottle should not make a "pop" sound but "sigh contentedly". Making the bottle "POP" is a sure fire way of reducing the carbon dioxide content of the champagne making it feel "flat" when you taste it.
 Do not put the glass in one hand and the bottle in another, unless you have the strength to hold the champagne bottle with one hand.
 This will stabilize the bottle for accurate pouring. If you have a very steady pouring hand, you can skip this step.
 This way, when you pour the champagne, the champagne will hit the side of the glass, reducing the speed at which it hits the base of the glass, thus maintaining the bubbly texture.


Pour the wine onto the side of the glass, not onto the base.
 This may take up to 4 or 5 pauses in a champagne flute or may be achieved in a single pour if using a traditional champagne "Marie Antoinette" shaped glass.


Twist the bottle as you remove it from the side of the glass to remove any remaining champagne on the edge of the bottle.

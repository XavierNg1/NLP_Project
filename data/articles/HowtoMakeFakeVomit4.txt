 You can use a decoupage glue, like Mod Podge, or white school glue. Plan on squeezing out about 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 120 milliliters).Use a cup that you can throw away, like a paper one.
 You just need a tiny drop of brown food coloring, water color, or paint. The vomit will look light tan now, but it will get darker after it dries., You can use just about anything to stir: a plastic spoon, a popsicle stick, a toothpick, etc., Place the parchment paper onto a baking sheet first. Next, pour the glue onto the parchment paper into a vomit shape. Save the rest of the glue for later.You can also use a sheet of wax paper or even plastic wrap.
 A handful of dry cat food or dry dog food will look gross. If this is human vomit, you could try a handful of dry oatmeal or granola. Put most of the chunks in the middle of the glue puddle, and a few bits on the edges., Simply pour the rest of your colored glue over the vomit puddle. Make sure that you cover all the chunky bits you added in. This will help seal them in., The glue will turn clearish once it dries. This may take a few days. If you get impatient, let it dry for about 48 hours, then bake it for about 10 minutes in the oven at 275°F (135°C).If you want to bake it, open up a window. It will stink!
Don't put wax paper or plastic wrap into the oven. If you used those, you'll have to let it air dry.
 The glue will dry semi-flexible, but be careful not to bend it too much. Leave the vomit some place for your victim to find, like the floor or their pillow. Because this vomit is made from glue, it should last a very long time.

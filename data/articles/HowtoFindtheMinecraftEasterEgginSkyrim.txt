 The Minecraft easter egg is located in a place that can only be accessed if you have the “Clear Skies” shout, a dragon shout that calms harsh weather and wind. You can get this shout by completing the “Throat of the World” quest.;
, The Throat of the World (should not be confused with the quest mentioned earlier) is the highest peak in Skyrim. To get to this peak, head southeast from the city of Whiterun for a couple of miles and you’ll see a snowy mountain peak on the horizon. This is the Throat of the World.
 There are a few broken staircases and rocks placed along the sides of the mountain that you can use to climb the Throat of the World. You need to get to the very top of the mountain to find the easter egg.
 As you get near the mountain top, the wind will start to get severe. When it does, open your in-game menu, select “Magic,” and choose “Shouts” from the menu panel on the right-hand side of the game screen. Select “Clear Skies” to calm the weather and make it easier for you to walk.
 Once you’re on the highest point of the Throat of the World, look behind some stones and you’ll find an axe called Notched Pickaxe, named after the creator of Minecraft. Pick the axe to add the easter egg to your inventory.

 If the room is still a functioning garage and you haven’t removed the garage door, the room will be subject to more moisture than if it were a fully enclosed part of your home. Thus, you’ll need to pick a desk that is uniquely suited to the environment in your new office.


Try to go with a glass-topped metal desk. It will be less susceptible to the elements.
If you pick a wood desk, avoid something cheap like particle board – which will warp when exposed to moisture.
 The unique environment of your office, if unconverted, should also influence the type of computer you use. This is important, as your computer is possibly the most expensive part of your home office set up.


Think about purchasing a laptop. This way, when you close for the night or aren’t at home, you can move the laptop inside or take it with you., Because of its location, your new office won’t likely be wired for internet. Thus, you’ll have to install internet. Fortunately, there are several ways you can do this:


Run an Ethernet cable from your router to the garage. If you have a crawlspace, you can drill a hole in the router’s room and run it under the house.
Set up a wireless router. This could be tricky, as many routers may not be able to deliver internet long-range. Thus, you may need to purchase a new router that has a longer range.
Use range extenders to extend the range of your wireless router.
You should also consider adding a phone line, whether it be a traditional phone or a voice over IP phone., If you're still using your garage as a garage, you'll need to make sure your electronics and important documents are secure. If they're not, you could wind up losing valuable equipment or personal information.


Install a safe to store important documents, like tax documents.
Purchase Kensington locks or similar devices to secure your computer and electronics to your desk.

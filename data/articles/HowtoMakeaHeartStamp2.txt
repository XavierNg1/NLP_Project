 You can use a pen or marker for this. This will create a rustic-looking stamp with lots of texture.You can also use this method on a much smaller scale on a pencil eraser. Make sure that the eraser is new and flat.You can also use this on a potato. Cut the potato in half first. Keep in mind that the potato will not last long.
 Try to cut about ⅛ to ¼-inch (0.32 to 0.64-centimeters) deep.Don't worry if your knife slips outside of the heart.
 As you cut, the negative spaces around the heart should fall away.
 If there are still some chunks around the heart, slice through the sides of the cork again, then cut away the negative spaces. Don't worry if it is not perfect; it's part of the rustic charm of this stamp., Tap the stamp into an ink pad or into some acrylic or tempera paint. Press the stamp against your desired paper, then carefully lift it away. If you need to, make any adjustments by carving back into the stamp.

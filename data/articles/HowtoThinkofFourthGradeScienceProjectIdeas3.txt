 A quick and simple way to introduce young kids to density is to fill two glasses with water. In one glass, add a teaspoon of salt. Put an egg in both glasses, and the egg in the salt water will float while the egg in the plain water will sink.You can explain to your students that this happens because the salt water is more dense than the plain water.
 A simple experiment for fourth graders is to mix vinegar and baking soda. The reaction produces carbon dioxide gas, which can be captured in a balloon to show the experiment is working., You can use anything from paper mache to a coconut to serve as the mountain. The real fun is in making lava erupt from the top of the volcano. Add 1 tablespoon of baking soda to 1/2 cup of vinegar inside the volcano. These chemicals will react and cause an eruption from the top of the volcano. If you want to change the color of the lava, you can add food coloring to the vinegar before reacting.

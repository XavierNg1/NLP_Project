 There is no crafting recipe for obsidian. Instead, any time flowing water hits a stationary lava "source" block, the lava turns into obsidian. You can find stationary lava in the following places:Lava is easiest to find as "lava falls" in caves and ravines. Only the top block is a source block.
Lava is very common in the bottom ten layers of the map. Dig down diagonally to avoid falling in it.
Rarely, you can find lava lakes on the surface, but never more than about twenty blocks above sea level.Some villages have a single smithy with two blocks of lava, visible from the outside.;
, Craft a bucket out of three iron ingots. Use the bucket on the lava to scoop it up. You can only scoop up stationary blocks of lava, not flowing lava.


In the computer crafting system, arrange the iron in a "V" shape.
 Make sure the hole is contained, and that nothing flammable is within two blocks in any direction. Wood, tall grass, and many other objects will catch fire near lava., Remember, only stationary (not flowing) lava will turn into obsidian. This means you will need one bucket of lava for every block of obsidian you want to make.


Remember, without a diamond pickaxe you cannot mine the obsidian without destroying it. Make sure you want obsidian in that location before you continue.
 Use your now-empty bucket to scoop up water. Bring it to the lava pool you created and place the water above the lava so it flows down onto it. When the flowing water hits the lava, the lava will turn into obsidian.


It's a good idea to build a temporary, non-flammable structure around the lava pool to prevent an annoying flood.

 With your hot glue gun, attach a half-inch (1.25 cm) white pom-pom to the bottom side of a one-inch (2.5 cm) white pom-pom. Add three more half-inch pom-poms to the same side to create the baby bearâ€™s legs. Once attached, the legs should support the larger pom-pom and hold it off the ground., With a pair of scissors, cut a three-inch (7.6 cm) piece of chenille stem. Bend the stem into a heart shape, with the ends curling in towards each other. Glue the heart-shaped stem between the front end of the body and a half-inch (1.25 cm) sparkly pom-pom to create the head., Glue a mini black pom-pom to the lower front section of the head to make a nose. Attach two mini-black pom-poms slightly above the nose to create the eyes. Cut a half-inch (1.25 cm) piece of white chenille and glue it to the back of the body to serve as a tail.

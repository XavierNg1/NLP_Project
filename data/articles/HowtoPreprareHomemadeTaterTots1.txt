 Wash and scrub the 2 pounds (908 grams) of potatoes, then use a potato peeler to completely peel them. Dispose of the peelings and place the potatoes in a large pot., Fill the pot of potatoes up with cold water until the water covers the potatoes by about one inch (2.54 cm). Then turn the heat to medium high., Cook the potatoes over medium heat until they reach a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low., Cook the potatoes for about 6-7 minutes, then poke one of the potatoes with a fork. If the fork can pierce the potato fairly easily but still meets resistance in the middle of the potato, the potatoes are done parboiling. If the potato is still difficult to pierce, cook until they are done.This process of cooking the potatoes before frying or baking is called parboiling. Partially cooking the potatoes ensures that they will be light and crispy when fried or baked instead of dense or mushy.
 Once parboiled, pour the potatoes into a colander to let the water drain away. Pat the potatoes with a paper towel, then place them on the counter to cool.

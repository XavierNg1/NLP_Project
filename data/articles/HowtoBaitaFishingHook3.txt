 A bridle is tied between the hook and the bait fish in order to keep the bait fish alive for a long time and to increase the chance of a good hook, since it is difficult to pull the bridle off.


Bridling is most often used in saltwater fishing to catch larger fish, since the proportionally larger bait fish is less replaceable and more easily manipulated.
 A thick cord of Dacron (also called Terylene or Lavsan outside the U.S.) works well.Don't use thin cord as this can cut right through the bait fish.
 Make a loop with 1/4" to 1/2" (6mm to 12mm) ends, or "tags", sticking out.
 Yank both ends of the loop to fasten the knot as tight as possible without pulling the tags through.
 Hold the lighter flame over the two ends until they are melted enough that they cannot pass through the knot.


Pull your loop as hard as you can to make sure it doesn't come apart.
 Place the fishing hook on top of your bridle, resting on a flat surface. Follow the next few steps to secure the two together if you don't know how to tie a "cow hitch".


The knot end should be positioned a short distance above the bottom of the hook's "J" shape (or the base of the "O" for a circle hook), with the rest of the bridle passing underneath the hook and extending below the J.
 It should pass above the J bend of the fishing hook and between the two sides of line next to the knot end.
 Pull the slack out of the line so it is tight against the J bend of the fishing hook.
 Loop the side nearest to the hook end over the hook point and pull it tight against the knot. This keeps it from sliding along the hook.


Make a second "hitch" like this if you want to make it extra secure.
 Many fishermen prepare bridles and hooks of several sizes so they are prepared for any size bait fish they happen to catch. You can also bring your own in a bait tank or practice on dead bait to get the hang of it.

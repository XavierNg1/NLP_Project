 Most banks now offer the ability to check your account records online or even by telephone. Many banks provide an app for use on most smart phones, so you can check your balance in the palm of your hand., Banks can use one of two different methods to determine whether to apply a minimum balance charge to your account. If you are aware of these methods and keep track of your accounts, you should be able to stay a step ahead of the bank and avoid incurring any minimum balance fees. Banks commonly assess fees based on either your daily or monthly balances. You should ask the bank officer which system is used when you set up your account:A daily balance system checks your account balance at the end of each day.
An average monthly balance system measures your account balance each day, and calculates the average balance at the end of the month.
 When you know your bank's system for measuring your balances and assessing fees, you can correct your balance to avoid those fees.If your bank applies the daily balance system checks, you will need to be aware of your balance each day. If you know that you have dropped below the minimum balance with some transaction during the day, you should add money to your account by the end of the day to avoid the fee. Using online banking or your cell phone app should help with regular daily balance checks.
If your bank applies the average monthly balance system, then as the end of the month nears, you will need to check your average balance. You can either get a printout of the month's activity, and then calculate the average yourself, or see if your account report will include a running monthly average.

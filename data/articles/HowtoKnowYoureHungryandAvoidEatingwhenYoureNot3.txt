 A emotional eating food journal is a great tool to help you become aware of and manage your emotional eating. You can use it to see where or when you eat and what types of foods seem to be craving or comfort foods. Write down what you eat, when, and how much.


Also take note of any emotions you may be feeling when you eat. This may help you gain insight into what emotions trigger you to eat certain foods.
Purchase a journal or download a journaling app on your smartphone. Track as many days as you can â€” both weekday and weekend days. Many people eat differently on the weekends so including both weekend and weekdays is important., These health professionals can help you manage emotional eating. If you're having difficulty managing your eating or it's taking a toll on your health, plan to meet with both a registered dietitian and behavior therapist.


A registered dietitian is a nutrition expert that can help you understand emotional eating, talk to you about true physical hunger and provide you with alternative food choices. They can even help you create a meal plan.
A behavior therapist will help you understand why you emotionally eat and give you ideas for changing your reaction or behavior to certain emotional triggers.
 No matter what health goal you have, having a support group in place is key for long-term success. This is especially true for emotional eating. Having a support group when you're feeling low or stressed can help you feel more relieved without the use of food.


Whether it's your spouse, family, friends or co-workers, a support group are your cheerleaders that will motivate and encourage through your progress.
Also try finding an online support group or a local group to meet up with. Email new friends that share your long-term goals.

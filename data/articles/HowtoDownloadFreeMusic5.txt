 There are a variety of sites and blogs that offer free MP3 downloads. Some blogs offer entire albums before they’re even released. Besides general music sites, there are a wide array of blogs dedicated to specific genres of music.


The vast majority of these sites operate in a legal gray area. For truly legal, free music, look for sites that release music under the Creative Commons license, or host music in the public domain.
 Browse the songs on the front page, or enter a song or artist name into the search bar at the top of the screen to search for specific tracks.


Don't click any of the advertisements. These ads tend to be misleading and can lead to dangerous or intrusive software downloads. Very rarely do they lead to more free music.
 On most sites, song data will be displayed next to each result. Some of the files will display a play time, file size (in Mb), and bitrate. Choose one you like.


Bitrate reflects the audio quality of the file. Generally speaking, mp3 files range from 60 to 320 Kbps, with higher numbers meaning higher quality. CD quality sound is 256 Kbps, radio quality is 192 Kbps.
Lower bitrates will lead to smaller file sizes. This is useful for users that don't have a lot of storage space on their computer or MP3 player, but want to have as much music as possible.
 Click the “Play” link underneath the song title to hear the song in your browser and make sure it's what you want.
 When you're ready to download the song, right-click the “Download” link underneath the song title, and choose “Save as....” Choose a location on your computer and save the file there.


Some sites will link you to download services instead of downloading directly from the website.
 Find the file on your computer and double-click it to open it. Check to be sure the file has downloaded properly. Once you're satisfied, file it and add it to your music player of choice.

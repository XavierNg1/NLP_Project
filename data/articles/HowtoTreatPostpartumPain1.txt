Don’t be embarrassed about carrying it around with you.;
, Place a cool pack or bag of ice over the wound to reduce swelling and improve pain. If you use ice, wrap it in a clean towel first – don’t press the ice directly onto your skin.Try dampening a clean cloth or pad with chilled witch hazel.

Be sure to discuss this with your doctor or OB/GYN first, and let them know if you’re breastfeeding or if you have any medical conditions.Do not take aspirin if you are breastfeeding.

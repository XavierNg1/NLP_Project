 This opens Control Center., It's an icon of two theater masks located below the "Silence" option. The icon will turn orange when enabled, and a smaller version of the icon will appear at the top of the Apple Watch screen to indicate that Theater Mode is active.

All sounds will be disabled, as will the "Raise to Wake" function.
Notifications will not activate the screen when Theater Mode is enabled.
To deactivate Theater Mode, open Control Center and tap the masks icon once again.

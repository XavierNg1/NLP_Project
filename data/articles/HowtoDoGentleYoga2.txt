 Restorative Yoga is a gentle style of yoga practice that aims to provide deep relaxation for the mind and body. Restorative Yoga often uses “props” (such as yoga blocks or bolster pillows) to aid in the process., Restorative yoga often uses a yoga mat, blocks, bolster pillows, eye pillows, and/or blankets to help you get comfortable, relax and release your muscles. For this restorative practice, you will need a mat (or blanket) and a block (or a rolled up bath towel)., The first step in this short restorative practice is to get in touch with your breath. Lying on your back, take deep breaths in through your nose, and out through your nose.
 For this pose you will need your block (or rolled up bath towel). Come to a kneeling position, and sit back onto your heels. Place the block (or towel) in front of you. Walk your arms forward and bend down to rest your forehead on top of your block (or towel). Stay here for 2-4 minutes.
 Now reposition yourself so that you are close to a wall. Place your rear end as close to the wall as possible, bring your back to the floor, and lengthen your legs up the wall. In this position, work to lengthen your inhales and exhales. Stay here for 5 minutes.
 When you feel sufficiently relaxed, allow your legs to come down from the wall and roll onto either side, using your arm as a pillow. Stay here for as long as you like.

 Negative thoughts are often a contributor to self-doubt. They can change how you perceive yourself and cause you to misjudge those around you. The next time this happens, change the negative into positive.


For example, if you think, “I’m terrible at cooking dinner. My partner is going to hate it,” change it to, “I’m an excellent cook. My partner is going to love this.” Altering your thinking to this could take a lot of work. However, eventually it will become easier and will hopefully replace your negative thoughts entirely.;
, Write down something positive about yourself daily. Start your day by noting something you love about yourself in a journal. Then refer back to it throughout the day to remind yourself of what you like.


Write down what you are grateful about at the end of the day. Here you’ll want to focus on what you have and what you have accomplished, rather than what you want and past failures. Read this every night and you may find that you have a more positive image of yourself and have feelings of gratitude., Anxiety and self-doubt can cause you to behave selfishly. You often focus on your needs instead of partner’s, which can cause problems in the relationship. Instead, talk to them about your feelings of self-doubt and let them know what you need from them to help them subside.


For instance, say, “I’m feeling really insecure about our relationship right now and it’s because of my self-doubt. Please reassure me that we are good.” Then tell them what kind of reassurance you need. Doing so may help them understand what they need to do to make you happy. Knowing your insecurities may prevent them from leaving the relationship.

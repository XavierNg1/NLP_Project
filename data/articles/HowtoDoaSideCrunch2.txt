 Lie down on a fitness mat on one side of your body. Your legs should be stacked on top of each other.Bend your knees.
 Place your upper arm’s hand (arm furthest from the mat) behind or at the side of your head. Place your lower arm’s hand either extended straight out from your body, or on your thigh or abdomen., Exhale and contract your abdominal oblique muscles to lift your upper body off the mat and crunch.Try to crunch to your side as high as possible, aiming to get your elbow as close to your thigh as you can.Pause and hold the crunch for a brief moment before inhaling and coming back down to your starting position.To make this exercise more challenging, lift up your knees simultaneously as you crunch. To make it even more challenging that that, you can straighten out your legs and simultaneously lift both of them up as you crunch., Once you have completed about one set of crunches (about 10–15 reps), flip over to lay on the other side of your body. Get into the same starting position you did before, with your knees bent and your arms in place, and complete a set on this side of your body.


Do 1–3 sets of 10–15 reps on each side of your body. Try to do these crunches about 2 or 3 times a week.

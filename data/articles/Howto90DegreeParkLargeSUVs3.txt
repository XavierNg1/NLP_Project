 Many SUVs are equipped with backup cameras. While this technology allows drivers to see what is behind their vehicles, it should always be used in combination with your side and rearview mirrors. You can use this feature when you are backing into a parking space, straightening your forward 90-degree parking job, or backing out of a parking space. To activate this feature, shift your vehicle into reverse. As you park, straighten, or leave a space, use the monitor and your mirrors to safely execute the task.


The process of parking, straightening, and leaving a parking space does not change with the use of the backup camera., SUVs are challenging to park. When the space you intend to park in is flanked on each side by other vehicles, the challenge increases. Minimize your risk of damaging other vehicles and your SUV by parking on the outskirts of lots or the top floors of a structures.
 Backing out of a parking spot in an SUV is very difficult—SUVs have several blind spots. It is always safer to pull out of a spot because you can clearly see oncoming traffic, pedestrians, and other potential obstacles. When you have the option, always back into a parking space or pull through a parking space.
 Like all cars, SUVs have blind spots. Unlike small vehicles, however, an SUV’s blind spots are much larger. When parking, use your mirrors to compensate for your SUV’s blind spots.

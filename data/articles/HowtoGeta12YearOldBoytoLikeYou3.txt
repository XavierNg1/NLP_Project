 Tell him about something going on with a group of people, like a movie, a party, or a game that week, and drop the hint that he should come. If he goes, you can hang out with him without the pressure of a one-on-one hangout or date.


Try chatting with one or more of his friends first and inviting them to the group activity too. That way, when you talk to the guy you like, you can tell him that his friends are going too and he will be more likely to say yes.
 Find him before he leaves the classroom if you have a class with him, or chat with him at his locker between classes.
 Sit next to him or just at the same table as him in the cafeteria at lunch. This is an easy and casual way to spend some time with him during school hours.
 Show up to a sports game that he’s playing in or watching, join a club he’s part of, or hang out at an arcade, bowling alley, or mall where he and his friends like to hang out. Make eye contact and strike up a conversation when you’re there.
 Get close to his friends to show him that you’re the type of person he likes to hang out with. You’ll get the opportunity to spend more time with him and learn more about him through his friends.
 When you’re ready to make your move, ask him out! Choose something as casual as going for a bike ride after school or something more formal and traditional like dinner and a movie. Do whatever makes you comfortable and lets you talk and get to know each other better.


Try a super spontaneous and casual date by saying something like, “Oh man, I’m really craving ice cream right now! Let’s go get some!”

That means that you shouldn't just try to become friends with the popular crowd if you don't like them at all. You don't have to hate them either. It is not attractive if you try too hard to be someone you are not. Be confident in the things you love, your talents, and the things you are successful in. If you make a mistake, laugh it off and try to do better next time. Remember all those who love you, and remember that everyone makes mistakes.

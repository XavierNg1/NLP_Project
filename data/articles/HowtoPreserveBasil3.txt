 Sprinkle 1cm or half an inch of salt into the base of a clean and dry crock, jar or ceramic storage container with lid.
 Make sure they're clean and dry.
 Sprinkle a light layer of salt over each layer of basil leaves. Continue this way until all the leaves have been added.


About every 10 or so layers, press down gently to slightly firm but not crush the layers of leaves.
 Press firmly but gently. Finish by pouring in a lot more salt to compact everything down.


Shake and jolt the crock a bit to help ease the salt into all the cracks and crevices between the layers.
 Place the crock in a cool and dry spot. The pantry is often ideal, or a cellar. Leave as long as you like.
 Shake the salt off the leaves then cook with them as usual.

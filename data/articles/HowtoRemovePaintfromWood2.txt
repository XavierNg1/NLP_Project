 Position the heat gun 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) above the painted wooden surface after you switch the heat gun on.Use an electric heat gun or electric paint remover. A blowtorch will also provide the necessary amount of heat, but blowtorches come with a greater risk of scorching or setting the wood on fire, so they are not recommended.
Wear protective gloves and goggles as you work with the heat gun.
Do not let the heat gun come into contact with the wood or come too close to the wood. Doing so may result in scorch marks or fire.
 Pass the heat gun over the surface of the section of wood you are currently working on. Continue passing it side-to-side and up-and-down without ceasing.


Do not let the heat gun linger in one spot for a prolonged period. Doing so will cause the wood to burn and potentially catch on fire.
 Once the paint begins to bubble and wrinkle, immediately scrape the paint up with a broad paint scraper.


If possible, continue to heat the paint with the heat gun in one hand as you scrape up bubbling paint with your other hand. If you have difficulty balancing both tasks, though, switch the heat gun off temporarily and scrape up any heated paint immediately.
 Even though it is possible for the wood to catch fire, these fires are usually small at the start and can be put out safely as long as you think clearly.


A small flame can usually be put out by smothering it with the flat side of your paint scraper.
Keep a bucket of water nearby as you work. If a fire starts to catch and cannot be smothered out, quickly soak it with the water.

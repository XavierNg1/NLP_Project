 If you are crafty in any way, or you have a friend who is, designing your own invitations can be cost effective and reflect your personality. Design the invitations either by hand or on a computer using a desktop publishing program.


Consider photo "Save the Date" invitations and wedding invitations. Although these are not traditional wedding invitations, they can be perfect for an informal or creative wedding. Typically, they are far less expensive than traditional engraved invitations.
Purchase paper and envelopes at a paper supply store or art supply store. These stores typically have a large selection of paper colors, weights, and finishes., Instead of including printed out maps, lists of hotels or other pertinent information for guests, put this information on a blog. Then include a link to a website in your invitation. You can cut down on some of your invitation costs this way.


You can also request people to RSVP by sending you an email, rather than returning a card. This will eliminate the need to include stamped return envelopes with the invitations you send out.
Remember that not everyone has e-mail or access to the internet. Great-Grandpa may need someone to help keep him in communication about the wedding.
 For less formal weddings, you might choose to move everything online and send invitations online. Design an invitation and send it from your own email address, or use an invitation site like Evite.


Using an invitation website like Evite can help you keep track of RSVPs, since guests will RSVP through the website.
Not everyone has e-mail! Elderly relatives, especially, may not have e-mail or use it infrequently.

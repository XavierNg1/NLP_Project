 If she keeps fidgeting and doing small things with her hands (Playing with a cell phone, checking her nail polish), or more physical touching (twirling her hair, scratching her nose, rubbing her leg, licking her lips) that means she wants to gain your attention or she may be nervous. However, it may be unconscious preening too.;
, For an example, if she asks you, "Can I use your pencil sharpener?" and she's using a pen, it's obvious; she adores you.
 For example, if she laughs hysterically or gives you a warm, welcoming smile after you say a rather awkward or not-at-this-time joke, like 0 telling 8 it has a belt.
 If you catch her staring at you and she glances away quickly on more than one occasion, this is a sure sign she likes you. If you're looking at her and she's still looking at you, smile or wink. You don't want to turn this into a staring contest!

, If she knows a lot about you, she may seem to ask you about things not many others know about. You may see her around a lot more than other girls and/or she might talk to your friends to get your attention.
 This includes laughing, also, check for changes in her voice... it may be softer or happier when she is talking to you.

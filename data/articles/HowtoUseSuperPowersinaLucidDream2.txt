 You have to clearly have a goal in mind so that you can focus on it. Concentrating on your goal in a sort of meditative practice helps you control your dream.


You can be anything, but many people enjoy becoming something that will allow you to experience the universe differently, like an alien, bird, or fish. You can also use shape-shifting to confront your fears: for instance, if you have a phobia of spiders, you can shape-shift into one and experience life from its point of view., A clear pond, window, or anything else that gives you a good reflection will also work.


Stare at yourself and will your skin to change and form into the shape you desire. You can also start at one end of your body (for instance, your feet) and consciously think of each part changing.
Some lucid dreamers like to walk through the mirror at this point, fully embracing the alternate persona., This is another method if you don't prefer to use a mirror or if you find it hard to visualize a mirror. Simply behave as if you were the thing you want to become. .


For example, if you want to shape-shift into a dog, go down onto your hands and knees. Start barking, and wag your tail. Pretty soon you'll feel your hands turn into paws and your face change.

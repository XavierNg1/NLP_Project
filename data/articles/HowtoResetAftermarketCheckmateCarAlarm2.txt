 Usually the battery is located under the hood or in the trunk. Occasionally it can be found other places, such as under a rear seat.
 This will cut power to the entire car. The ground is the cable connected to the negative battery terminal and is usually black.
 Lock all passenger doors from inside the vehicle and the driver's door from outside with the key (you wonâ€™t be able to use the remote).
 This is only necessary if the battery is under your hood.
 You must hold this down when you connect the battery. Note that your alarm may not be equipped with a hood position detector. The detector looks like a plunger switch pointing upward. It will be pressed down when hood is closed, telling your alarm that nobody has tampered with the hood. The plunger will usually be enclosed within a rubber boot.


If your battery is not under your hood, it is not necessary to have the hood open and manually depress the hood position detector. You can simply close the hood.
 This will restore power to the vehicle with all doors locked, trunk locked, and the hood position switch held down. Having everything closed and locked up will signal to your alarm that no intrusions have taken place, and this should reset your alarm.


If all is well the horn will be silent, and the headlights will stop flashing.
The car is ready to start.

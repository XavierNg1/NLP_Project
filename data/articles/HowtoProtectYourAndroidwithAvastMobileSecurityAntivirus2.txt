 Find the app on your Android device and tap on it. It has the Avast logo on it.
 Tap “Wi-Fi Security” from the main menu on the main screen. You will be brought to the Wi-Fi Security settings.
 The network where you’re currently connected to will be displayed. Tap the “Run Scan” button on the bottom of the screen to scan this network for any vulnerabilities. The scan will check your connection, Wi-Fi, encryption, and router. You can monitor the scan progress on your screen as it scans each one.
 If your network is secured, you will get this notification. If problems are found, they will be listed. Since network issues cannot be controlled within your device, you have to fix the network problems separately. You may need to check your Wi-Fi settings, encryption, and router configurations. You may refer to your router’s user’s manual for troubleshooting or call your service provider for assistance.

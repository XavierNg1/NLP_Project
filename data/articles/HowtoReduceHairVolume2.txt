 Select a shampoo that reduces your hairâ€™s natural volume. Choose a dense, moisturizing conditioner that will weigh the hair down, creating a more sleek appearance. Look for products with natural moisturizers, like avocado or almond oil. These products will hydrate your hair, weigh it down, and produce a sleeker look., Shampooing strips your hair of the natural oils that form on your scalp. Since it takes longer for these oils to spread through and down the shafts of your thick head of hair, you should not shampoo your hair every day. Wait 2 to 4 days between shampoos to reduce frizz and poof. Apply the product directly to the scalp, avoiding the ends of your hair.
 After shampooing your hair, always apply conditioner. Run the product through the shafts of your hair, avoiding the scalp. In addition to using a rinse-out-conditioner, apply a leave-in-conditioner too!

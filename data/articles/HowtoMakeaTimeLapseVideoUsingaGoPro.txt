 This is important with a GoPro especially as there are multiple makes now. If you're using a GoPro Hero 4, put it into time-lapse mode with an interval of 5 seconds (you might want to do more or less, depending on what you're shooting). Use the highest Megapixel setting to get the best quality.;
, This is to ensure that the images for the time-lapse are always in the same frame and make it look smoother. Overall this will improve the image quality.
 This is so you can do longer time-lapses without having to stop half way through to change the battery or give it some more memory.
 Make sure what you want to capture is in shot.
 It will start taking pictures at the intervals requested; all you have to do now is wait until you have taken enough pictures. Try not to knock the tripod, as this will cause a jump in your time-lapse.
 To do this, take the micro SD card out of your GoPro and use and adapter to plug it into your computer.
 It would be best to make a folder for your particular project, as there could be thousands of images. Put all the files into one folder so you can find them all later.
 Once imported, select all the images and adjust their display time down to below 1 second. It's up to you on what looks best.
, Choose some audio that you have and just import it in the software over the images. This will give people watching it something to listen to so it isn't just silence.
 When fully completed and you have exported the video, you can upload it to any social sharing site, so other people can enjoy your creation.

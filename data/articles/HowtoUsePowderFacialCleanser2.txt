 In order to you use powder facial cleanser as a facemask you must first create a paste. Just as before, the exact recipe will vary from product to product (read instructions), but a good place to start is to mix 1 tsp. of powder with 1 tsp. of water. You will want to create a slightly thicker paste., Spread this paste over your face and neck. Create a thin layer of paste, but be careful to avoid the sensitive area around your eyes., The amount of time this takes can vary from product to product (or even in different climates), but in general, this should take around 10 minutes. Leave the mask on until it is dry.


For a longer treatment, simply spray the mask with a little water and allow it to dry again.
 To remove the mask, begin by rehydrating it. Splash water on your face until the mask become a paste again. Then rinse it off with cool water.Repeat weekly.
 Once again, it is important to follow any cleansing regimen (such as a mask) with a light moisturizer. Be careful not to overdo it, as too much moisturizer can clog your freshly cleared pores.

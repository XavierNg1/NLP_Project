 If your state does not offer online SNAP (food stamp) services, contact customer service and have them check your balance for you, or give you advice on how to check it in your state. You can find toll-free numbers to call listed at the USDA website, along with websites that may include online customer service.


Call the number listed under "Client" to ask about your balance. The number listed under "Retailer" is for stores who accept food stamps as payment.
 Search online for "EBT contact" and the name of your state. The number listed should be the same as the one you've already called, but the information may also include a physical office look-up, or contact info for a related service that may be able to help, such as the Women, Infants, and Children program (WIC).
 Your remaining balance is typically printed on your receipt when you pay with your benefits card. If you do not have this, make a small purchase using your benefits card, and ask the cashier for the receipt.


The receipt may print this information under "EBT balance," "SNAP balance," or the name of the state-specific program (such as Quest or CalFresh).
 The amount of time it takes to receive your first SNAP (food stamp) payment depends on your state. You should always receive it within 30 days of your application being filed, or within 7 days if your income is low enough to qualify for rapid assistance.Your caseworker, or person who filed your SNAP application, should be able to give you more information on its status.
 If you want to find out whether this months' food stamp balance has been distributed, you can check the schedule online without an account. Visit the federal SNAP website and click the name of the state that issued your benefits card. Typically, states assign benefits between the 1st and 10th of every month, depending on the number written on your benefits card.

, Choose ones in colors that match or complement the flip flops. It's a good idea to use large buttons on the middle of the flip flops where the straps meet, and place smaller buttons along the straps.
 Larger buttons go in the middle, smaller ones can surround the larger ones and weave on down the straps.



Keep a few spares aside for buttons that get knocked off and lost. It will likely happen!

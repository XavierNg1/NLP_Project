 For this method, you will need the following supplies.









Grapevine wreath form
Small and medium sized pine cones of any kind
Hot glue gun and glue sticks
Paint in a color of your choice (optional)
Craft glue (optional)
Glitter (optional)
Paintbrushes (optional)
Ribbon for hanging

, Before you begin, it's a good idea to think about how your want your finished wreath to look. Sketch it out if you like, for reference.
 Using your hot glue gun, apply a small dab of glue to the back of a pine cone and press it onto the wreath form in the desired location. Continue doing this until you have covered the form. There is no special order in which to attach the cones, but you might find it easier to start with the larger ones and use the smaller ones to fill in the gaps. Allow the glue to dry thoroughly.
 When all the glue has dried, you can paint your wreath if you like. Use a paintbrush to paint a coat of paint over all the pine cones on your wreath. Allow the paint to dry thoroughly.
 For a festive, holiday touch, add some glitter to your wreath. Using a clean paintbrush, dab some glue on the pine cones. Sprinkle glitter on the wet glue. Allow to dry thoroughly.
 Pass a length of ribbon through the center of your wreath. Tie a bow at the tip of the ribbon loop. Your wreath is now ready to hang.

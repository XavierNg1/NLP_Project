 Do this by sketching a cube or a standing-up shoebox shape, as shown in the example. Your birdhouse can be as tall or as short as you like, but try to keep the proportions realistic.
 Connect them to one another with straight horizontal lines., Draw a thin cylinder just under that, sticking out from the side of the birdhouse to serve as a perch., These can be the initial form of the house, wood grains, or any other designs that you have in mind. (You can add an extra room or even another floor! Just use your imagination.), Finish it up with colors of your choice!

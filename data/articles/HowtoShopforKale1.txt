 After kale has been picked, it starts to degrade. To ensure that you are getting the freshest kale possible, make sure that the kale you are purchasing has been refrigerated or that it has just been picked.Look for kale in the refrigerated section of your grocery store. Don’t buy kale that is not refrigerated.
Ask farmers when the kale was picked and if it has been refrigerated. If it has been more than a few hours unrefrigerated, then you might want to pass on that kale. However, if it has been kept refrigerated, then it should be fine.;
, Kale that is sold in grocery stores has been widely tested for pesticides as part of the Environmental Working Group’s annual “Dirty Dozen” test and it tested positive for insecticides that are human nervous system toxins.For this reason, it is best to buy organic kale. This will help to ensure that the kale you are eating is as safe as possible.


Check the packaging for the words “certified organic” to determine if the kale you are buying is organic. If your store’s produce section has an organic section, then look for loose leaf kale in this area.
If you are shopping at a farmers’ market, you can check around to see if any of the farmers are certified organic. However, keep in mind that most small farms are not certified organic, even though they may use organic practices. Ask the farmers what they use for pest control and whether they use organic practices.
 The leaves and stems on fresh kale should be firm and not limp or wilted. If the kale you are looking at is limp, floppy, or wilted, then do not buy it.Most grocery stores mist their fresh produce to prevent them from becoming limp or wilted, but it is still a good idea to check.
 The leaves and stems should be a dark green or light green color, depending on the variety of kale you are looking at. Steer clear of any kale that has brownish or yellowish looking leaves. This means that the kale is starting to go bad.

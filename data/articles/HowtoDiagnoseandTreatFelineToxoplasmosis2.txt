 Always consult your veterinarian first before giving your cat any type of medication. Your vet will be able to prescribe an appropriate treatment regimen for your cat based on its symptoms and the severity of the disease., Your vet will most likely prescribe an antibiotic in the form of a pill. In order to administer the antibiotic, open your cat’s mouth and quickly place the pill in the back of its mouth. Do not let your cat go until the pill is swallowed. Reward your cat with a treat afterwards for good behavior.Alternatively, you may be able to grind the pill and mix it with a small amount of your cat's food. However, make sure to ask your veterinarian if it is safe to do this with the medication that has been prescribed to your cat.Give your cat the correct dosage per your vet’s instructions, and make sure to finish the entire course of antibiotics.
Antibiotics such as Clindamycin, pyrimethamine, and sulfadiazine are typically used to treat toxoplasmosis.
 Place your cat’s bed, food and water bowls, litter box, toys, and other possessions in a separate room. Keep your cat in this room during the first week of antibiotics. This way, you can prevent the disease from spreading to your other pets.Make sure to check on your cat regularly.
You may want to take your other pets to the vet to ensure that they do not have the disease as well.

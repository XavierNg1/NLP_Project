 To determine the exact length of irrigation tubing you need to construct your hula hoop, stand up straight and measure the distance from your feet to your chest (or anywhere between your belly button and your chest). This measurement is the diameter of your ideal beginner hoop if you have a normal BMI. If you are overweight or obese you can calculate your ideal hoop size by multiplying your waist in inches by (1.2). (39"x1.2=45" hoop). You then need to calculate its circumference to know how much tubing you need. (circumference = pi (π=3.14) times the diameter: c=πd).


The average diameter of an adult hula hoop is 40”, so the circumference is 40 x 3.14 = 126”.
The average diameter of a child’s hula hoop is 28” making the circumference about 28 x 3.14 = 88”. ;
, You'll need three things, all of which can be found in the plumbing section:


¾" (19mm) 160 psi for a weighted hoop, 100 psi for a medium weight hoop (or any other pressure rating) irrigation tubing
A PVC pipe cutter
One ¾" (19mm) barbed coupling plastic pipe fitting
If you don't want to buy a PVC pipe cutter, you can use regular scissors. However, scissors require more effort to cut the PVC pipe.
 If you have one already and you are handy with it, a hacksaw is another option – you just may need to debar any sharp ridges using sandpaper or a utility knife.


In which case, you'll need sandpaper or a power sander. If you use a power sander, you'll need goggles to protect your eyes. As you can see, a pipe cutter is the easier way to go.

 These options are good for hanging pictures that are 20 pounds or less.









If you are using a nail and hammer: Select a 1 ½-inch (4d) or 2-inch (6d) nail. Place the nail in the center of the pencil marking that you made in the previous step. Drive the nail into the wall at a steep 45-degree angle. The 45-degree angle gives the nail much greater strength than simply driving it straight into the wall.If you are using a drill and screw: Drill a hole in the center of the pencil mark you made. Screw the screw into the hole.If you are using a traditional picture hook: Insert the nail through the sleeve on the hook. Hold the hook against the wall at the desired height (where you made the pencil mark) and tap the nail into the wall (the hook will hold the nail at a 45-degree angle automatically). Be carefully to only tap the nail and not the hook, as the hook could cut your wall., Heavier pictures call for more durable hanging devices. Choose between a spiral anchor or a toggle bolt.









If using a spiral anchor: This method is the easiest way to hang heavy pictures. Drive the spiral anchor into the wall with a screwdriver. Drive a screw into the anchor with a screwdriver. Some spiral anchors come with special picture hanging hooks.If using a toggle bolt: Drill a ½-inch hole into the wall. Align the metal channel along with the straps and slide the metal channel into the hole. Hold the ends of the straps with your thumb and forefinger. Pull them toward you until the channel rests flush against the backside of the wall. Slide the plastic cap along the straps until the cap is flush against the wall. Push the straps side to side and snap them off when they are level to the cap. Insert a bolt over the cap and insert the bolt. The package that the toggle bolt comes in will have specific instructions for your individual bolt.

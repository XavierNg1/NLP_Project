 You'll want to visit a surf shop if you don't already own adequate gear. Planning ahead can save you time and money, and can help prevent injuries.


Choose comfortable swimwear. Some experts recommend wearing swimwear with minimal drag, like brief-cut swimming trunks, to cut down on the resistance your body will have in the water.The less resistance your body has, the faster and smoother your body will cut through the water. But water resistance isn't the only factor to consider.;
, Unlike a typical outdoor outing, where the air temperature is the most important factor, body surfers need to take the water temperature into account. For this reason, you may want to wear a wetsuit to stay warm when the water is cold.


Choose the right wetsuit for your environment. There are many cuts and styles of wetsuits available, and where and when you will be body surfing will determine what kind of swim wear you'll need. The most important factors to consider are the thickness of the suit and the sleeve/leg length. These vary from short sleeves and legs, three-quarter length sleeves and legs, and full-length suits. , Unlike traditional surfing, which uses a floatation device like a surfboard, body surfing uses only the surfer's body to ride waves. But that doesn't mean you have to navigate the waters without any assistance. Many body surfers wear fins that strap to the feet to help cut through water faster and ride waves more efficiently.


Find the right fit. Try on different pairs by different brands to find the pair that fits you best. You don't want fins that are too big or too tight. It may be helpful to think of fins as a natural appendage. They should move with you comfortably and help you swim more fluidly, rather than hinder you.

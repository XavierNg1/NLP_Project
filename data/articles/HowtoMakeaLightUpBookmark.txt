 To do this, measure a rectangle on your blue piece of fabric that's 19.5 cm by 6 cm. Lightly mark it in pencil and then cut the felt along the lines you created.
 Put the first piece of blue felt on the second piece of blue felt and trace the shape onto it. Cut the second piece so its measurements are the same as the first piece of blue felt., For example, you might make a rocket ship or similar easy-to-cut shape. Design it as you please., Make sure it's centered and includes space in the desired location for your light-up feature.,,,, Make sure it connects all three of the previous components that you stitched to the piece of felt. Start at the Lily Tiny going all the way from the switch to the battery. When you're done stitching, test your light to make sure it works., For a more polished look, stitch the second blue piece of felt from earlier to the first piece of felt along the outlines. This will hide the messy stitching that will appear on the back side of the blue felt piece, giving a more professional feel to the product.

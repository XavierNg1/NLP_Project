 Cut pieces of yarn to the same length. Decide how many strands of yarn you want to put together. Fold your pieces evenly. Insert your crochet hook into the first loop from the bottom up of the shawl.Take the pieces of folded yarn with your crochet hook and hook them through the loop.
Push the pieces of yarn through the loop created by folding the pieces in half. Pull taut.
Continue until you've added as much fringe as you want.
 Tassels look particularly good on triangular shawls, because you can add a thick one to each of the corners that hand down. Tassels are made in the same basic way as the fringe, only you add more pieces of yarn to each bundle.Cut the pieces of yarn for each tassel the same length. Fold them over evenly.
Insert your hook into the stitch where you want to place the tassel or fringe. Insert your hook into the middle of the folded-up lengths of yarn, as you would to a loop when you were crocheting.
Pull the pieces of yarn through the stitch. Wrap the other side of your yarn around your hook and pull it all through the loop. Tassel completed.
 Shawl pins are a great way to add a little character to your shawl. You can make them very easily from a dowel, some wire, and beads that you enjoy. You can even paint the dowel if you're feeling really creative!Cut a dowel about six inches long and drill a small hole in one end. Sharpen the other end in a pencil sharpener
Slip a wire, about eight to ten inches long, through the hole, and twist to form a loop large enough to move freely in the hole.
Thread beads onto each wire end until satisfied and then cut excess wire. Twist the wire into a tight loop.

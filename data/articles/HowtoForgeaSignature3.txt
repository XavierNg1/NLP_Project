 Many first-time forgers pay too much attention to the original signature and forget to pay attention to what they're writing. If you're looking at the signature instead of your own pen and paper, your forgery is going to come out shaky and strange-looking. That's a dead giveaway that you've just signed someone else's signature.


If you don't have a lot of time to practice a signature before signing on the dotted line, your best bet is to first study the signature, taking note of all the important elements, and then sign it as naturally as possible while actually looking at what you're doing.
 Another big clue that a signature has been forged is when it's apparent that the signature was retouched. Think about it - do you go back and adjust your letters after signing your own name? No, you're probably fine with a slightly sloppily crossed "t" or a half-formed "b." It's abnormal to see spots where these natural errors have been painstakingly corrected.
 Again, think about how you sign your own name. You do it in one smooth motion, keeping your pen to the paper the whole time. A signature with little gaps indicating the person signing paused, picked up the pen, then started again is a big sign that it was forged. When you're forging a signature, avoid this big mistake and sign it as naturally as possible., People don't sign their names the exact same way every time. It's easy to spot forgeries when you see a series of signatures on many different documents that all look exactly the same. This is a problem you can run into if you're using tracing paper to forge signatures. Be sure to do something a little different every time to make the signatures look authentic.Â

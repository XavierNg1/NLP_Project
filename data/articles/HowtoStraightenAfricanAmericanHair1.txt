 Silicone creams and other hairdressing products are made with oils like petroleum and lanolin or silicons like dimethicone or cyclomethicone. This may be the simplest method for straightening your hair, but it's important to pick out the right product. Some creams and hair-dressings make your hair look weighed down or greasy. Read some reviews before you decide which product to pick up at the store.


Oil-based products are easier on your hair than products with silicones, but all creams and hair dressings will wash out with shampoo, and they won't cause long-term damage like other straightening techniques.;
, Creams and hair dressings should be applied to damp hair for best effect. Shampoo your hair, rinse it out, and pat it dry with a towel to get it ready for the cream application.
 Depending on the length of your hair, pour a liberal amount of cream or hairdressing into the palm of your hand. Rub your hands together and then apply it to your hair, working from the roots to the tips to ensure every strand gets covered.


As you put the product in your hair, use your fingers to pull the strands straight down. This will help your hair lose its curl as the product gets to work.
Use a wide-toothed comb to help pull the cream or hairdressing through your hair.
 There's no need to use a hair dryer or straightener; the oil or silicones in your hair product will keep your hair from curling up as it dries. Let your hair completely air dry, then style it as usual.

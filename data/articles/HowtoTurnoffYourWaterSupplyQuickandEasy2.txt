 This is usually a brass valve which has a round handle. In the majority of homes is located near to the point where the water pipe makes its way into the property - often in the kitchen, downstairs WC or even utility room. In warmer areas this valve may be found outside, in colder climates it will be inside the home., This will cut off the stream of cold water into the home. All appliances that use water will no longer work until the water is turned back on.
 Run your sinks and showers until the water stops flowing. Turn off the faucets. Now you can begin your plumbing repairs safely. When you are finished turn the valve counterclockwise to restore water.

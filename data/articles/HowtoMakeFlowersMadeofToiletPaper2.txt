 Simply place a few drops of color with a 2 tablespoons of water in a shallow dish. The more drops of food coloring you use, the more vibrant your dye will be. To keep it more natural looking, stick to one drop of food coloring with your water., Carefully dip the tips of your flower into the dye. Keep it upside down until your petals dry. This will take anywhere from 5-30 minutes, depending how heavily you dipped your flowers.


Because you’ve used toilet paper, it will soak up the dye very, very quickly. Remember this when dipping the tips of the petals. You barely need to touch the dye to add a lot of color quickly to your petals.
 Use different dishes to use multiple colors for your flowers. Once you’re comfortable enough dipping them, you can even use different colors per flower. To do this, simply roll the outside tips gently through the dye and then dip the taller petals into your second color.

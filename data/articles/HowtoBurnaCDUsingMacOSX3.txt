 After you drag the file into Disk Utility, click on the image in the sidebar, and then click the Burn button at the top of the window.
 Once you click Burn, click the arrow button in the corner of the Burn window to open the burn options. Make sure that “Verify burned data” box is checked. Click Burn to start the burning process.

 It takes a little while for the body to get accustomed to a new mattress, so start really paying attention to the way it makes you feel after about three days. Think about these questions:


How many hours of sleep do you get on the new mattress?
Do you toss and turn or sleep soundly?
Do you feel achy or sore during the day?
Does your back feel supported, or do you sink into the mattress uncomfortably?
Do you feel well rested, regardless of how much sleep you get?

, If you aren't sleeping well on your new bed, it's best to return it. Start the process of choosing and buying a mattress again, taking into account the factors that made the old one inappropriate for your needs.

 You should add several drops of each type of oil to a spray bottle filled with water and a few squirts of dish soap. Shake the bottle to stir the elements together. Then spray the areas of your house that seem to attract wasps, including under eaves and on porch roofs.Don’t spray the whole area, as this would require more than one spray bottle of solution and can be very expensive. Focus on spraying where there have been other nests on your home.
You can also buy wasp repellent in home improvement stores if you’d prefer not to mix your own.
 There are some plants that keep wasps away because they don't like the smell. Planting a few of them near where you spend a lot of time - the front porch or your backyard - can help keep wasps away. Mint, thyme, eucalyptus, and citronella will all repel wasps, and they'll also make your yards smell great!, Since wasps are territorial, they won’t build a nest within 20 feet or so of another nest. Hang one decoy on each side of your house to keep wasps away from the whole house.

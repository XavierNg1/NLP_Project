 Even though Cleo is a bit spoiled and mean, she does have a big heart of gold. You can act like a rich girl, but don't be mean to anyone or boast about your royal heritage. Be a good leader (Cleo is captain of the "Fearleading" Squad) and help your friends when they need help. Never take advantage of your brainy friends (Ghoulia), but you can have a study-buddy if you like., Cleo is a true Egyptian princess. You can dress like Cleo by wearing lots of gold jewelry and tight clothes. For her basic look, wear a sparkly blue shirt with beige leggings and a gold necklace with jewels on it. For the Dawn of the Dance Cleo, wear a blue or teal off the shoulder dress, brown leggings and gold and turquoise jewelry. For her Gloom Beach look, wear a leopard or tiger print bikini with a blue or teal beaded bikini bottom with a see through wrap.
 Cleo has brown and black hair with gold highlights, you can get some golden clip-on highlights if your hair is dark and some black highlights if your hair is light. Wear your hair loose with a shiny headband.
 Use gold eyeshadow and purple smokey-eye. Wear blush, lipstick and lip gloss. Don't forget her signature blue jewel on her right cheek!

 The common gauges are 10, 12, 16, 20, 28, and .410. 28 is smaller than 20 which is smaller than 16. The larger the gauge, the smaller in diameter the shell is .410 is an odd exception, just remember it is the smallest.
 If it is, you can only shoot slugs - preferentially "sabot slugs". If your barrel does not have grooves in it, you can shoot everything, including sabot slugs - though the slugs won't be very accurate.
 Not only are they the cheapest shells available, but they are gentler on your shotgun and (generally) your shoulder.
For larger small animals, such as ducks up to large geese, you should buy shotshells with somewhat larger shot, say #5 up to #2.
For larger animals, such as coyotes or deer, it is best to use slugs - the largest round available in a shotgun shell.

Alternatively, you may choose to buy slugs for shooting large animals. Remember, sabot slugs for rifled barrels, "rifled" slugs for smooth barrels.


To fit a shotgun, Hold the shotgun with your dominant shooting hand with the barrel pointed up, rest the end of the shotgun stock in the crook of your arm, where your elbow is bent, if your trigger finger can reach the trigger comfortably then the gun fits your arm and fits you!

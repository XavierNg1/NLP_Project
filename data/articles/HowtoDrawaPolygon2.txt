 A polygon doesn't have to be regular to be a polygon. If you want to keep your drawing process easy, just use a straight edge and pencil and draw several line segments that interact to form a closed shape. In itself, that's a polygon!While most people think of regular polygons when they hear the terms "hexagon," "octagon," etc, these terms don't always indicate that the polygon is regular. A "hexagon" just has to have six sides; a "regular hexagon" has to have six sides of equal length, with equal interior angles.;
, Whether you decide to do a simple polygon or a star polygon, the segments do have to be in a circuit, meaning there's no opening on one side. Keep it closed, and keep every line straight, and you're good to go!, If you want to know more about your polygon, you can take it a step further: find the perimeter or the area of your polygon.

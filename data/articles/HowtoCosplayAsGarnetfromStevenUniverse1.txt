 Garnet has two-toned pants in the pilot; you can create this effect by replacing the right leg of a black pair of leggings with a leg from a dark gray pair. If you're not into sewing, you could simply cut off the right leg on the black leggings and wear them over the gray ones.;
, Garnet's shirt in the pilot is a little elaborate, but you can start off by buying or making a magenta crop top and wearing a black tank top underneath, since Garnet's pants actually cover her entire waist.


Sewing will probably be necessary to create the semi-star pattern near the top of her shirt. A dark purple arch goes on the outside, with a stripe of the shirt's color within and a pink triangle at the center.
A strip of golden ribbon and a matching star pin should go on top of the shirt.
Styrofoam or something similar might be necessary to recreate the shape of her sleeves.
 You'll need to cut the gloves up a bit, too: they end at the wrist, save for a strip of fabric that goes up and covers the middle finger, leaving most of the hand exposed.


However, you could also leave the palm of the gloves intact to attach gems to. This is possibly the only safe way to include Garnet's gems in this cosplay.
 Any shades will do fine, but Garnet's specifically are very angular, basically consisting of two overlapping triangles. They have a dark magenta tint and are dark enough to conceal her eyes.
 Garnet's hair in the pilot is shoulder-length, with blunt bangs over her forehead.
 Garnet's outfit is basically a jumpsuit, so she doesn't technically wear shoes. Jumpsuits like this are rather hard to come by, though, so you'll be best off wearing black boots.

 Whether you're in the classroom or on the bus or at work, always find a way to sit beside him or get close, that way you can talk with him whether it be about the weather or a sports team. Just get to know him better!;
, If you've chatted before he will recognize you and most likely accept the request; a friend request is one of the most common and nonchalant things today, so don't dread or be afraid they have connected the figurative dots and know your crushing; this fear is equivalent to worrying people thinking you odd for, say, breathing. If you're good friends already send him a message or give him a poke!

,, Guys love it when girls smile as it's a sign of friendliness and makes you more approachable. More than likely he'll think your smile is cute also!

, After general chatting with him everyday on the bus for 3 months you're probably wondering, "what next?!" Well, naturally, you'll be friends by now and will talk about other things but if you're really stuck, why not talk hobbies? Find out what he likes and if you like the same ... viola!

, After you're past the general chatting stage and you've become good friends ask for his cell phone number or he might ask you for yours, but make sure you know him well enough!

, If after all this you want to meet up with him after work or school for some relaxing time as friends why not go to the cinema, park, seaside or shopping mall? If you get the feeling he won't go if it's just the two of you then invite more friends, some of yours and some of his and everyone will get to know each other more!

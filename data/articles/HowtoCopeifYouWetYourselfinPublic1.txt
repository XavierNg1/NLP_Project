 Find materials on and around you that will make the wet spot less visible. Don't be afraid to get a little creative.


Use a sweater to wrap around your waist, or place a purse/bag/hat in the right area.
Use your body. Change up your posture or fold/place your hands over the most visible areas.
If there are other liquids around (juice, soda, etc.) spill them on top of the wet spot. This will cover up any smell or stain, if any, and provide a credible excuse. Only use this method if you are aware it will wash out of your clothing, or if you do not care about staining your clothing.
Wet the entirety of your bottoms, weather permitting, to even out the color. This may be a tad uncomfortable, but it will be less obvious that you have wet yourself.;
, The truth is never a bad option, especially if it’s obvious what has happened. Otherwise keep your excuse simple and believable.


Don’t ramble. The more explanation you provide, the more questionable it will seem.
Use excuses like, you sat in something or spilled, and find a bathroom if you haven’t already.
 Draw attention to something that is away from you and make your escape.


Ask the people around you what you think is happening across the room, or make an outlandish statement that will require them to look away before they answer.

What kind of food are they serving?
Why are Anna and Ben hugging? I thought they got a divorce.
Look, Jennifer Lopez's new music video is on!
That guy really doesn't know how to play basketball.

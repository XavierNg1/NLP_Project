 This method will require more work but less expert timing. Begin by using a spade to cut a 6-8” radius trench around the entrance of the ant hill., Once you finish creating the trench, start shoveling out the area inside the trench, which will be comprised of the majority of the ant colony., You will need to dig up quite a bit of ground to reach all the various chambers of the colony, so keep two five-gallon buckets on hand and shovel the soil into them.Try to keep the clumps of earth as intact as possible so as not to collapse every tunnel as you dig the colony out.You also want to make sure that you cover each bucket as you will it to stop any queens from potentially escaping.
If you use this method on a brand new colony where the queen has just mated and is still digging out her nest, then you won’t have to dig very far, and you won’t have much to sift through to find her.Telltale signs for this type of brand new colony include a very small entrance hole with a small heap of fresh dirt beside it that hasn’t yet been formed into a mound., They can be hard to identify while working quickly, but you should especially follow chambers and tunnels in the soil as you dig out the colony. Keep collecting samples until you see very few ants left in the hole., Once you have collected the colony, you will have to sort through the buckets manually to find the queen. Use a spoon to sift through the dirt and separate ants.You may want to transfer the ants into smaller jars as you separate them and the soil.
For obvious reasons, you probably don’t want to do this inside your house.
 It will be a painstaking process, but you should eventually locate the queen as you go through the colony. If you are unsure of what exactly you are looking for, the queen will be the largest ant in the colony, and her middle section--the thorax--will be especially pronounced.

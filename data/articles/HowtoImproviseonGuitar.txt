 In the best case scenario, either a bassist or other guitarist will play rhythm while you play lead, and you can switch off every several measures. This will really help with your rhythm.;
, Your playing should reflect back to the song.
 Basic knowledge of music theory is essential for successful improvisation. The more you know, the easier it will be.
 Are you improvising to a 12 bar blues? Is it a salsa piece? Or funk? Swing? Knowing what rhythms are distinctive for each genre of music will help you express the piece, and also help you get into the piece yourself.
 When playing in E minor you could play part of "Mary Had a Little Lamb." Audiences love to hear traces of a well known song mixed in with a surprising and new beat. In fact, there is a Latin version of "I've Been Workin' on the Railroad." New takes on old ideas are always good.
 What are you going to play at the chord switch or the turnaround? Be prepared for every subtlety, and know what to do at every switch.
 You don't have to shred for the full solo; in fact (in most cases), you shouldn't. Blues pieces often require slow, smooth licks more than tremolo picking.
 If you are playing jazz, chances are there's a "head," or main theme that you will refer back to after the solos. Make sure your notes sound good with the background parts, especially if you're playing with a big band (which might consist of trumpets, trombones, saxophones, drums, bass, and guitar). Also, it's good to incorporate different genres of music into your solos, but maybe that Phrygian scale you just learned sounds horrible with the rhythmic funk that your band is playing.
 Just let it rip, baby!

, Every soloist has hit a bad note; it's how you learn what sounds good.
 It's good to experiment with what sounds good on your own, but after practicing improvisation with other people, you should become fluent enough in music theory, scales, and chords to know what will sound good. At some point, everything should just come naturally. You don't want to be surprised by anything while performing.
 Have one for each genre that you're interested in improvising with, and make sure it's adaptable for new songs. It's perfectly acceptable to play a blues scale if you're improvising over a 12 bar blues; just make sure your rhythms match what everyone else is doing.
 If you followed these steps, they may even say yes.
 Audiences love to see a soloist having a good time while improvising. Music is fun![[Image:Improvise on Guitar Step 14.jpg}}

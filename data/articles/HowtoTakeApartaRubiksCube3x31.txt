 Hold the cube flat in your hand and grab the top layer. Turn it so that its corners are sticking out over the middle squares of the second layer. Leave it in this position for the next step.;
, To be clear, you want start by prying up the middle piece on the top layer, not one of the corner pieces. Use slow, steady pressure to pry it up without breaking it. Once it is out of place, wiggle it while pushing on the back of the piece to get it to pop it out.


This will be easiest with a tool like a flat head screwdriver. Use the screwdriver like a lever, putting the skinny flat end under the middle piece and pushing the other end down.
There are recommendations for other tools below if you don't have a screwdriver handy. In a pinch, you can use your thumb, but this is harder.
 Now, there should be a gap where the middle piece was. Take out the adjacent corners by sliding them into the empty gap. Rotate them side-to-side slightly as you pull them out. It may be a little difficult to get the internal locking mechanisms to slide out, but with gentle, persistent pressure the pieces should come out easily.
 You should now have three pieces out and the cube's top layer still at a 45 degree angle. Take out the middle edge piece right below the row you've removed.


The pieces should come out easily without the layer above to hold it in place, but you can use a lever here if you need to.
 At this point, it should get easier and easier to remove each successive piece since they are no longer held in place by the ones around them. There's no "right" way to proceed here â€” simply pull pieces out as you wish, sliding them to the side as needed until they come out easily. You can also try turning the remaining layers so that you can pull pieces out at different angles. The last few pieces should come apart with very little effort.

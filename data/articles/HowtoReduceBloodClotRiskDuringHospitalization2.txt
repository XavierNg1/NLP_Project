 Maintain a balanced diet and cut down on fatty foods and sugar. Without putting your health at risk, get as much exercise as possible or as recommended by your doctor. Go for light forms of exercise, like a half hour long walk per day.Exercising will help you lose weight, reducing the pressure on the veins in your legs and pelvis. This decrease in pressure can reduce blood pooling, which makes it less likely you will experience a blood clot.
 Smoking is bad for your overall health and puts you at a greater risk of developing a blood clot. Try to quit smoking before your hospital stay and discuss a smoking cessation plan with your doctor.You won’t be able to smoke in the hospital anyway, so cutting back or quitting beforehand will help reduce nicotine cravings during your stay.
 Prior to your hospital stay, develop a prevention play by talking to your doctors about your family and personal history with blood clots. Discuss your lifestyle and health with them, including how active you are, whether you’re on birth control or other medications, your age, whether you smoke, and whether you have chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes.An inactive lifestyle, many medications, heart and lung conditions, being over age 55, and smoking can all increase the risk of developing a blood clot.
Ask your care team about your risks and options before hospitalization. Ask, “Am I at a greater risk for developing a blood clot or bleeding problems? Do I need blood thinners or other anticoagulants? Which medications are best for my particular needs?”

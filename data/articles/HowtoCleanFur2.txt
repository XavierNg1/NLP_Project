 To do this, mix one-part vinegar with two-parts olive oil and mix thoroughly. The oil will recondition the skin of the coat and help prevent it from drying out and becoming brittle.Flaxseed oil will work as well.
 You will be applying the conditioner directly to the skin or pelt, so you will need to remove any lining that may be on the inside of the coat.Typically, these linings are made from leather.
 Using a clean cloth, dab the solution onto the inside of the coat one section at a time, directly to the skin of the fur. Coats that are dry and brittle may need to be conditioned several times. If the skin hasn't been dried out too harshly, you may be able to restore it's soft texture.


Do not apply to the fur.
Make sure the liner is removed.
 Continue using a clean cloth to rub the conditioner into the skin. This will help the coat absorb the oil. Do not overwork areas that are particularly dry. Instead, try conditioning the area again once the coat has dried.


Coats that have not been conditioned may be stiff and brittle.
 It will take a few days before the vinegar has evaporated and the oil has properly been absorbed by the skin.When the coat no longer smells of vinegar, it is ready to be worn.


Remember, furs should always be hung on broad, padded hangers to prevent the shoulders from losing their form.

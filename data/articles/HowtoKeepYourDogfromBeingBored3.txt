 Dogs, like humans, are social animals who enjoy spending time with others within their species. Allow your dog to play with other dogs by creating opportunities for such social interaction., A companion animal (e.g. a trained dog) for your dog can provide an array of benefits, which include encouraging exercise and physical activity, relieving loneliness, and providing affection and companionship to your dog.
 A good way to create opportunities for your dog to enjoy time with other dogs is to arrange play dates with friends or family with dogs.Doing so will allow your dog an opportunity to socialize with other dogs and will also allow you to catch up with friends and family at the same time.
 You can also take your dog to a dog park or dog daycare to allow her time to socialize with other dogs. You may not have the time or the financial means to take her to daycare everyday but try doing so at least a few times a week if possible.

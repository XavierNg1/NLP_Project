 You may need to get icing or fondant color, and you won't need much of it at all., Add a tiny amount and stir it in with with your drink., Dip a straw or stirring stick into the liquid to get a tiny amount, and mix into your beverage. Or, add less than an eighth of a teaspoon of dust and stir.

You can also use silver or pearl icing mist, but it just ever so slightly effects the flavour. It's not terrible, so if your drink has a good amount of flavor, it shouldn't be noticeable at all, but remember that if you use the icing mist, you must let the drink sit for a little while. When you spray it in, it may splash a bit. When you have enough in, let it sit for about 20 seconds or so, then stir in like normal.
 Watch your friends accuse you of witchcraft.

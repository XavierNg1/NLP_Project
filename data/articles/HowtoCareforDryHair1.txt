 Use shampoos and conditioners that contain natural oils, like olive and argan oil, glycerin, sorbitol, and shea butter. Shampoos and conditioners that contain keratin or plant-based moisturizers, like phytobalm, are super hydrating as well.In general, try to avoid products that contain mineral oil, petrolatum, sulfates, silicone, and alcohol such as stearyl, cetyl, and cetearyl alcohol. These substances can exacerbate dryness.;
, If you wash your hair daily, gradually reduce the frequency with which you wash your hair. Start by washing your hair every other day for a month. After a month, reduce the washing to every three days. You should observe a noticeable difference in the texture of your hair after two to three months.Washing your hair every day strips it of its natural oils.
Use dry shampoo to touch up your hair in between washes.
 If you have long or thick hair (or both), then double the amount. Try to avoid using too much shampoo since this can further dry out your scalp and hair. Additionally, when shampooing, focus on the roots of your hair near your scalp., Even if it is not time to wash your hair with shampoo, you should wet your hair and apply conditioner daily. Focusing on the middle of your hair and the ends, apply the conditioner. Leave the conditioner in for five to ten minutes, then rinse.Use a deep conditioning treatment once every seven to ten days.
You do not need to apply too much conditioner to the roots since the natural oils produced by your body will moisturize them.
 Do this after shampooing and conditioning. The cold water will close the hair follicles, enabling your hair to trap in the moisture.Additionally, if you have color treated hair, rinsing with cold water will help preserve the color, reducing the amount of touch-ups needed to maintain your look.

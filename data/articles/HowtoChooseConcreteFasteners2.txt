 This will depend on how heavy of an object is being fastened to concrete.


Use a 3/16 inch (0.47 cm) or a 1/4 inch (0.63 cm) fastener for smaller, light objects that can be held while you fasten them to concrete.
Use a 3/8 inch (0.95 cm), 1/2 inch (1.75 cm) or 5/8 inch (1.6 cm) diameter fastener on objects of medium weight, that require assistance from others to fasten to concrete.
Use a fastener with a 5/8 inch (1.6 cm), 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) or 1 inch (2.54 cm) for heavy objects that must be mechanically fastened to concrete.
 For example, a fastener with a 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) diameter will need to be screwed or drilled deeper than a fastener with a 3/16 inch (0.47 cm) diameter for proper holding.

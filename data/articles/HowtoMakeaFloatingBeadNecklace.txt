Slide a crimp bead and the clasp onto the string.
Push the short end of the string through the crimp bead to form a loop. Pull it tight.
Using flathead or crimping pliers, crimp the bead so the clasp is secure.
Cut the excess string using wire cutters.
 To mark the location of the beads, use White-Out or a similar correction fluid to make small marks on the string.
 Flatten the crimp bead with your pliers.
, Make sure the glass bead is secure between the two crimp beads, and then flatten it with your pliers.
 Leave about two inches of string at the end to attach the other part of the clasp.
 This is what you will attach the clasp to in order to close the necklace.

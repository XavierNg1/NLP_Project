If you have perfectly proportioned hourglass curves, look for a dress that has ruffled trims along the collar, sleeves, and bottom hem to avoid throwing your curves out of proportion.
If one area of your body is smaller in proportion than another, look for a dress that places ruffles over that portion. For instance, if you have a small bust and wide hips, look for horizontal ruffles that add volume and detail to your bust.
 Some women may be able to pull this look off, but for many, the ruffles are bound to cross over a problem area they would rather mask. If you have a rectangle body type, however, a tiered ruffle dress may provide a welcome increase in volume.
 Ruffled dresses can look girlish, but a sultry high heeled sandal may give your look the spice it needs to boost it into womanliness.
 Many ruffled dresses have a naturally sweet appearance, and a cute flat or kitten heel can coordinate well with that sweetness without pushing the cuteness over the top.
 A ruffled dress may put even more ruffles on your body than a blouse or skirt. Avoid embellishment overkill by sticking with one or two extremely simple pieces of jewelry, like pearl post earrings or a delicate choker necklace.

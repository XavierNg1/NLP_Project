 For a little help on getting started, you could order a klutz book. Many have crafts you could sell in them, though you'd have to save up because most of them cost around $20 to make.
 Find a really pretty feather. Pick it up with a tissue or something then clean it off good. Find a nice string and tie it on. Add beads or anything you like to make it look better. Voil√†! You've got a pretty feather necklace that old people will love to buy, maybe.
 Find some fishing line and a hook and really anything else around the house. Get creative! Add bells, beads, anything that doesn't get damaged in water!

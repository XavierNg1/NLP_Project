 This method works best if your hair already has a bit of natural curl. Let it air dry a little bit; when it's about 50% dry, it's ready to be diffused.
 Most blow dryers come with a diffusion attachment that you can apply to the barrel to disperse the air flow.
 Use mousse or gel for optimal hold. For a more textured look, use a sea-salt spray.
 Set the blow dryer on cool. With your free hand, gently bring a section of your hair up to your scalp in a claw-like grip with curved fingers. Aim the blow dryer through the gaps between your fingers. Maintain this position until the section is dry; repeat on other sections.


For the sections on top of your head, bend over at the waist and flip your hair upside down for easier access.
 Your hair won't need much tousling if you diffuse it - the waves will already be loose and natural-looking.

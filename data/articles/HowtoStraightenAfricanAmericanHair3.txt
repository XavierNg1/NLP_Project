 Hair straightening irons are particularly damaging to hair, because they apply direct heat. That means you've got to start conditioning your hair a few days or even weeks in advance to get it ready for the hot iron. Use a good conditioner in the week or two beforehand when you wash your hair, and do a deep conditioning treatment a few days before straightening day to make your hair soft and ready for heat.


If you want, you can deep condition on the day you want to straighten your hair. Just make sure to rinse it all out before you start the straightening process.
You can also blow dry your hair before straightening if your hair is extra kinky. Follow the steps in the previous method and skip straight to the flat ironing technique., Go ahead and wet it so you can dry and straighten it at the same time with your flat iron. If you used the blow dry method first, don't wet it again.
 Work it in from the roots all the way to the tips, since using direct heat on your hair can cause damage. Products made with Moroccan oil and argan oil are great for your hair and result in a sleek, shiny finish.
 Choose a small section that you want to straighten first. Use a comb to comb it out straight, then smooth it out with your fingers.
 Close your flat iron around the section of hair at the roots. Pull it down the shaft of the hair until you've straightened and dried it all the way to the tips. If the hair is still curly, go over it once more with the straightening iron.


You can apply more heat protectant serum as you go if your hair looks like it's getting dried out.
Don't go over the same shaft of hair too many times. This can make your hair start to get brittle.
 Doing a little at a time gives you control over how much heat you're applying to your hair, reducing the risk of damage. Take your time and go over each strand of hair until your entire mane is straight, sleek and glossy.

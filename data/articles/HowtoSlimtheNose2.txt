 If you're conscious of the size of your nose, drawing attention to your lips can be a great way to train someone's eye elsewhere. Bright reds or darker shades will draw attention from your nose to your mouth.
 Start at the side of your nose and brushing up over your cheekbone toward your eyes. This will put the focus on your cheeks and eyes instead of your nose.
 This is another trick that when combined with the others can draw the attention away from a large nose. You don't have to go too heavy, but just using a basic dark mascara and liner will give you a dramatic and sophisticated look.
 If you find any blemishes, use a bit of spot touch-up make up on the nose so they donâ€™t draw any more attention to the size. Pimples and acne can draw attention toward your nose even more.
 If you pull your hair back and part it on the side, or style your hair in another asymmetrical way, you can get other people to look toward the side of your face, rather than the middle. This helps to draw attention away from the size of your nose.
 This is very important when trying to achieve any desired makeup look. By filling is your eyebrows a bit closer together will instantly make your nose look much more slender than before.
 If you tilt your head back and keep your head held high, your nose will appear somewhat smaller that it will with your chin pointed down. This can also apply to everyday life. Walk with your head up!

 Wash it in hot, soapy water. After rinsing the jar, place it wet on a baking tray and dry it for 15 minutes in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F (175 C).You’ll need two jars for this process, one for letting the honey steep and one for storing it in.
 The proportion should be roughly 1 part herbs for every 10-12 parts of honey. Place the dried herbs in the bottom of the jar, and pour the honey over the top. Screw the lid tightly.Some of the herbs that go particularly well with honey include elderflower, rose, mint, sweet basil, lavender, thyme, sage, star anise, and rosemary.
Honey is a good medium for infusions because it has healing properties in itself. Use raw honey if you’d like to take advantage of its antibacterial qualities.
 Keep your sealed jar in a warm place away from direct sunlight. After a week of steeping, taste your honey every few days until it is flavored to your liking. You can let it rest for up to four weeks.If you want the process to go faster, steep your honey in a hot water bath. Place the sealed jar in a large bowl so that it’s completely submerged in water. Add freshly boiled water several times to the bowl over the course of two days., Once your honey is infused to your liking, strain out the herbs using a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth. Store the strained honey in a freshly sterilized jar.Keep your herbed honey in a cool, dark place. It should last as long as the shelf life of your honey.

 Open the call by saying, “Hi" or "Hey, how are you doing?" Use words that conjure up friendship rather than love interest. Depending on the culture of your area “friend” terms might include mate, pal, best friend, chum, etc.
 If she calls you pet names such as “baby” or “sweetie” you may have to tell her that you are not comfortable with that. One way you can do this is via humor. You could say, “Hmmm, I'm not really ready for sweetie. Just Mark is good for me.”


Some girls will assume that “hanging out” actually means dating, so be cautious when you use that phrase.Avoid using the word “date” in any context. For example, instead of saying, “It's a date” go with,"Sounds good. See you in a bit."

, If she asks if you are setting up a date, tell her “no” in a gentle way. It is best to be straightforward early on in your friendship about each of your expectations. Tell her, “It's my loss. I’m just not interested in us being more than friends.”, Be careful giving compliments and don’t talk about overly personal topics such as the body, dating, etc. Again, this sets the boundaries of your friendship within platonic subjects like sports.

 Go out to watch at midnight or later. The pre-dawn hours are usually the best for viewing because the side of the Earth facing the sun allows more meteors to be visible., Mittens or gloves and a warm hat are also a good idea for those who feel the cold at night.


Bring a reclining chair if you don't fancy lying on the ground or holding your head tilted back all night.
 Planning a camping trip at this time is a great option.
 If you are unsure of your orientation, use your compass or an app to get your bearings and determine which direction is northeast.
 The meteors can be seen using the naked eye.

For closer views, use binoculars or a camera with a telescopic lens. You don't have to use these to appreciate the meteors, however, and these can limit your field of vision, causing you to miss the ongoing show if you don't know where to look.
 The stars of Perseus form somewhat of a "Y" or "V" shape and the meteors will seem to shoot outwards from a central point in this constellation. They will be visible, however, all over the sky.


Perseus can be found by following the bottom left star in Cassiopeia (the W constellation) down and to the left. There is a double cluster that appears the meteor shower is coming from.
 The tripod is important to provide stability during long exposures and limit the camera movement when you take the photos.


Put the camera focus on "infinity" and use an open shutter over a period of minutes if your camera has this capability.

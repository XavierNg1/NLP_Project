 This method is only available for Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10. If you are using one of these operating systems, begin the easy Tor installation by downloading BlackBelt Privacy at this link. The download is about 20 megabytes, so it will finish with a couple minutes over most internet connections. You should then ensure Firefox is installed because the BlackBelt Privacy installer will look for it and use it set up a Profile for browsing over Tor.


If you are using a different operating system, use the instructions for setting up Tor manually instead.;
, Open the file you just downloaded. A prompt should appear asking you to select how you'll be using Tor. If you don't know which one of these to choose, one of the following three options are probably what you're looking for:Choose "Tor Client Only Operator" if you want to use Tor's network without joining it yourself.
Choose "Censored User" if you are living in a country that censors internet traffic.
Choose "Bridge Relay Operator" if you want to both use Tor, and help other people stay private by relaying through your computer.
 The software will automatically quit your Firefox if you have it open, and change its settings to give you a new Tor Firefox Profile Icon on your desktop. Use this icon to switch to the Tor mode for Firefox.
 Once it's complete, open Firefox.You should now be able to browse using the Tor network.


If you have problems with the installation process, try contacting a BlackBelt administrator for more information.
 As long as you are connected to Tor, it will be much harder for other people to access your personal data. However, using Tor with Firefox is not the most secure way to browse, especially if you do not alter your browsing habits. For greater security, follow the advice in the section below on becoming more secure.

 Carefully push the legs of the cage into the soil, centered over the tomato plant. Stop once the cage is firmly fixed in place. If you feel any resistance, pause, and readjust the position of the cage before continuing. Pushing down too recklessly can damage the roots.
 This serves as a defense against insects like tomato worms and stink bugs. Wrap the netting around the entire cage, holding it on the cage with clothespins or other sturdy clips.
 Do not allow the soil to get soggy, however, since this much water can drown your roots and cause them to rot. During dry, hot weather, you may need to water once a day.
 They need a minimum of six hours per day, especially during late spring and early summer when temperatures are still moderate.
 Excessive sun and heat can cause the container to heat up, drying out the soil in the process. Pin a shade cloth to the lower part of the cage using clothespins. The shade cloth should extend a foot above the top of the pot.
 Mulching is another technique used to keep your plants from drying out too fast. Spread a little mulch over the top of the soil and around the stem of the plant.
 Apply a water soluble fertilizer after you water your plants in the morning. Follow label directions concerning application.
 Even when you use netting, there is a chance that some pests, like aphids and flies, will get through. If an infestation occurs, use neem oil or a safe-for-humans pesticide to ward off the bugs.
 The fruits should almost be completely red, with only trace amounts of green remaining. Ripe tomatoes can be plucked or snipped off their branches.

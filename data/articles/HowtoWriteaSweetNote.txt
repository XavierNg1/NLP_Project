 In order to be sweet you have to be real, so it helps if you really enjoy the person. Such as your parents, your best friend, your girlfriend/boyfriend ex.;
, Even if it's just for no special occasion, it's better to specify as opposed to getting an anonymous card!

, Instead of something such as "You're so nice!", be genuine. Say things like "You are always fun to hang around with and you make me feel like I'm..."

, They can see right through you if you lie, and what's the point of getting a nasty card. Only write this if it's from your heart.
 Even if you have to write this on the computer, make such your grammar, punctuation, and spelling is 100% perfect.
 Make it personal and only for them.
 Use a normal piece of paper folded in half. No one cares if the card is sparkly and store-bought, it's what you write. So be sure to have lots of room.
 When you do, smile. Or leave it in a sweet place, like on their bed or their desk. If it's your crush or boyfriend/girlfriend slide the card through the vents in their locker.
 They are usually the right things to say. Just write it as you think it, that goes a long way

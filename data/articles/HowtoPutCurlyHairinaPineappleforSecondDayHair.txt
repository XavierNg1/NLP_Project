 To get good second day hair, or even third day hair from your natural curls, you need to start off with a good hair day on your first day.
 You want to use something that won't leave a ponytail indent on your hair while you sleep.,, Depending on how thick your hair is, you will only want to wrap it once or twice. The ponytail needs to be loose so it doesn't indent the curls. Don't worry if it's loose.


Note: If you have short curly hair you may want to do two pineapple pigtails instead of one. Otherwise, most of your curls won't make it into the pineapple!

,


Clip it: If your hair is very long, it is probably flopping around in your face by this point. Take some medium sized claw clips and clip the pony to the top of your head. This will keep the hair from flopping around while you sleep.

Wear a sleeping cap: Another option is to just pull a satin sleep cap over your pineapple. This will keep the curls in place and protect your hair from frizz while sleeping.
 The pineapple should be comfortable to sleep on. If your hair is not inside a sleep cap, you may want to sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase to minimize frizz., This is different for every head of curls. You may want to spritz with a refresher spray and walk out the door, or spray some water on and use a little light gel to finger curl your hair until it's as you like it.,

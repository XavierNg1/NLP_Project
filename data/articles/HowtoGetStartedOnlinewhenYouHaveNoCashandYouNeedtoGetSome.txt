, I will concentrate on blogger. Setting one up takes less than 15 minutes.
 Now FYI, if you post more than 3 per day you will need to implement a code given to you by google. This is to prevent people from creating spam blog's like used to be done a few years back.
, You'll notice things like google news and links one your blog. Remove them by going into the html option in your dashboard. Simply find the line of code and erase it and save it, you're done.
 Sign up. Google will review your blog and more than likely accept your site as long as you are within the Terms of Service.
 Don't bother buying them, Google's team of experts in your adsense profile will show you everything you need to know. Best of all it's free and much more helpful than any of those useless adsense ebooks. Moving on, make sure your ads go with your colors and blend in. The ads placed will go with the theme of your website so all you need do after you have been accepted is add the code in the page elements tab found in your dashboard.
 Go to pingoat.com and fill in the blanks. Do that every time you post an article.
 If you need more go to google and search Ezine submission service or something like that.
, Rinse and repeat. In other words create more blogs on informative subjects. Within a matter of days you will start to see traffic to your site and some cash. How much you make depends on what you do.

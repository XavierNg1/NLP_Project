 Chances are that most sites that list available proxies are also blocked at your school. Building a list at home will help you find more sites to use.
 A proxy site is a site that fetches the blocked website for you, and displays it through the proxy site. This means that the filter software never actually sees you going to the blocked site (YouTube), just the proxy site.
 Your search result should list quite a few sites that index available proxy sites.
 Your school's network administrators actively block new proxy websites as they appear, meaning that a large number of the sites you find will already not work.


Grab sites from multiple different proxy lists.
 You just need to be able to access your list from the school's computer.
 If it is blocked, move on to the next site until you find one that is unblocked.
 Click the button to open the site.
 A proxy will increase the amount of time it takes for sites to load, since the traffic has to be routed through the proxy server. This means videos will take longer than normal to play. Also, make sure that your proxy doesn't block scripts, or else YouTube won't load.

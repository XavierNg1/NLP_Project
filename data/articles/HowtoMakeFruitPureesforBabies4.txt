 Along with all of the foods listed in this article, you can also begin to feed your baby finger foods when she reaches this age. Finger foods include pieces of apples or bananas, as well as cookies or crackers. Feel free to feed your baby one cup of fruit spread out over the course of three feedings per day., Mangoes are a tropical fruit that you can slice up and feed your baby. You can also make them into a puree. Ripe mangoes give off a delicious scent and give when you squeeze them.

To make mango puree, wash the mangoes and then slice through the thickest parts as close to the pit as possible. Continue until you have sliced off as much of the flesh as you can. Scoop the flesh off of the skin and put it in a food blender. You can mix the blended mango with yogurt.
 Ripe papayas can be mashed or blended for your baby to enjoy. To prepare a papaya, slice through the whole fruit and scoop out the seeds that are located in the middle. Slice through the peel to remove the skin and then place the fruit in a food processor.

Keep in mind that you must use papaya the day that you puree it, as it will not keep like other fruits will.

 Choose a fair concealer that matches your skin’s undertones. Apply the concealer with a light hand to avoid a cakey look, and leave freckles uncovered.
 Many powders and concealers have an orange tone which can look odd on fair skin. Make sure you find one that matches your undertone or opt for a translucent powder that won’t add any artificial color to your face. A large, rounded kabuki brush is best for this, as it covers a large surface area and distributes powder evenly.
 Choose a blush in your color family, but make sure it is light. Smile to locate the apples of your cheeks and apply blush in a circular motion using a small powder brush.
 Opt for clear or brown mascara if black is too strong a look for daytime.
 White liner makes your eyes appear bigger and makes you look wide-awake.
 Choose a shade in your color family appropriate for day. A pale pink is always flattering.

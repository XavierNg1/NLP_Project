 Mix 5 cups of milk with 2/3 of sugar in the pan, stirring frequently until the sugar is dissolved. You don't have to worry about preheating the pan, it can start cold as the sugar dissolves.;
, Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the pan to prevent burning. You want the mixture to turn into a thin paste, bubbling and simmering all the while.The liquid will reduce, meaning dissipate until there is not much left, throughout this process.
Do not turn the heat up to try and speed things along -- you'll just burn the sugar.
 Add two tablespoons of butter and 3/4 a cup of powdered whole milk and mix it well. Let the final "dough" cook for another few minutes, until it pulls off the sides of the pan in one big chunk.Cut the butter into small pieces to help it melt faster.
 The paper will prevent the dough from sticking to the surface as it cools. When it is cool enough to handle, move on.
 The dough should be between 1/2-1" thick. For this recipe, you should end up with 35-45 individual pastillas de leche., Lay some white sugar out on a plate and roll the candies in the sugar to coat them completely. They are ready to serve!

, Try mixing up your pastillas with a little something special. Add ingredients with the butter and mix them in well so that there are no "unflavored" patches. Some to try include:


Zest from a lime, orange or lemon.
1 teaspoon vanilla, almond, or peppermint extract.
1 teaspoon cinnamon or pumpkin spice.

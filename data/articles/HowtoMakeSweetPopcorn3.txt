 You can use the stovetop as described above, or zap a bag of unflavored microwave popcorn.
 Put 4 oz (110g) dark chocolate chips or finely chopped dark chocolate into a microwave-safe container. Add ½ tsp (2.5 mL) salt. Heat in 10–15 second intervals, stirring after each one, until melted. Chocolate burns and separates easily, so take care not to overheat.
 Spread out the popcorn on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper.Pour the chocolate over it.
 Leave the chocolate at room temperature for about one hour, or until it forms a hard shell. Eat, sprinkling on more salt if desired.

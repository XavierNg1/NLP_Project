Songs in your iCloud Music Library will be completely deleted from all of your libraries, and will not appear on any of your connected devices.If the song was purchased from iTunes and downloaded, you'll just delete the local copy. You can choose to hide the song when deleting it, which will remove it from all of your connected devices.
If the song was purchased from iTunes but not downloaded, you'll be prompted to hide the song when you choose to delete it. Purchases are only hidden, never completely removed from your account. See the Unhiding Your Purchases section below to find your hidden purchases.

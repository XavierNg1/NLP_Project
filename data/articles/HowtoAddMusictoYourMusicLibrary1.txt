 After the CD loads, your computer will bring up a menu with several options. These include "Burn," "Play," "Add to Playlist," and "Rip."


If you have set Windows Media Player to rip audio CDs automatically, it will open the program and begin ripping the CD immediately.
To change whether Windows Media Player automatically rips CDs or not, open the program, right-click on empty space in the tab bar, and go to "File," "Tools," "Options," and "Rip Music." Then select "Rip CD when inserted." You can choose to always automatically rip CDs or rip CDs only when the "Rip" tab is open.;
, This brings up the "Rip" tab in Windows Media Player where you can select and deselect tracks for ripping from a list.


Ripped songs will automatically appear in the Windows Media Player library list and your "Music" folder. If you retrieved information on the CD from the Internet (Windows Media Player automatically searches for it) the audio files will appear in a folder that designates the artist's name and a sub-folder that designates the album's name.

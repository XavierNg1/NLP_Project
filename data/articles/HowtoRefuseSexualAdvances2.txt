 Don’t accept a drink from someone who is making unwanted advances, even if they order and pay for the drink anyway. They are trying to obligate you to give them your attention, and you don’t have to accept that pressure.


Say, “Thanks, but I’m not interested.”
If they buy the drink anyway, say, “I told you that I’m not interested. You can give that drink to someone else.”

, Don’t try to be nice by dodging the question or giving an indirect response. Using a serious tone, tell them that you aren’t interested.Don’t say “Oh, tonight I’m focusing on my friends.”
Do say “No, thanks. I’m not interested.”

, Support your statements with your nonverbal gestures. Back away from the person, and put your hand up as if to say “stop.” Keep your body rigid and your face stern. Maintain your personal space.
 Minimize your contact with the person. After you tell them no, walk away and put distance in between you and the person making the advances. Focus your attention on who you came with or enjoying the atmosphere of the place.
 Your friends can help you monitor the situation and avoid interacting with the person again. They can also help you in the event that the person decides to harass you.


Say, “That guy over at the bar just asked me to go home with him. I said, ‘No,’ but could you guys let me know if he starts walking this way?”

, The staff can help you if the individual persists, especially if the behavior turns into harassment. They may even be able to remove the person from the establishment.


Call a taxi, driving service, or friend if the situation escalates so that you don’t have to go home alone.

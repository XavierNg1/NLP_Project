 Get your pita bread and place it on a plate. SpreadÂ tomato puree or sauce over the top, leaving a gap round the edges. Use a spoon or butter knife to spread thoroughly.;
, Lightly place a slice or layer of cheese on top. Use any cheese you like, its all up to you! If you would like, you can try sprinkling shredded cheese on top.
 Lightly sprinkle ham or chicken pieces on top. Use different types of ham and chicken for a fun twist to your pita pizza.
 Preheat your oven on medium heat. Place the pita pizza in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the bottom is a dark tan and the cheese is melted.

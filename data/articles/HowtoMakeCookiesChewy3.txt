 Before storing your cookies, allow them to cool completely on the baking sheet. Then, store them promptly once they reach room temperature. Leaving them out will encourage them to dry out., To keep your cookies their most chewy and moist, store them in an airtight container such as a cookie jar with a lid or a Tupperware. If you don’t have either of those, a Ziplock bag will do just fine.


Make sure your cookies are not hot when you store them. Storing hot cookies in an airtight container will cause the cookies to fall apart., To keep your cookies chewy and moist longer, add a slice of fresh sandwich bread to your storage container with the cookies. This will add moisture to the container, which the cookies will absorb. You’ll know the method is working because the next day your slice of bread will be dried out like a piece of toast, and your cookies will be soft and chewy.

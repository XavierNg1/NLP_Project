 Some games are more complex than others. Some games are set in fantasy worlds, some are more realistic. Some are even futuristic. If there has been a book or a movie written about it, fiction or non-, you can probably roleplay it.;
, Roleplaying is generally a social activity, so once you've decided what you want to focus on, it's time to find two or three other people interested in the same thing.
 It will most likely be whoever knows the rules of the game best.
 Just what a "character" means will depend on which game you end up playing, but in most games, there will be a myriad of character types you can choose from. Your "Character" will be your means of interacting with the game, with you (as a player) making all the decisions as to the character's actions. You decide what actions your character will take and which they won't. This is often one of the most rewarding experiences of the game, seeing the consequences and rewards of certain choices and their effects on the character and his/her friends and environment.
 Having fun, after all, is the main point. If your character doesn't last, you can always make a new one. The Gamemaster will describe the settings and will play the parts of the people your characters will meet and interact with. The players will state how they interact with the environment and how they react to situations the Game master presents.
 So every monster you face, every merchant you buy things from, every rebel commander, will be acted out by the Gamemaster. If it sounds like a tough job, it is! But being the Gamemaster can be very rewarding.

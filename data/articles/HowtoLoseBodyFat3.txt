 Before starting any type of intensive weight loss program, it's a good idea to meet with your doctor to discuss what's healthy for you.


Make sure that losing body fat won't affect any preexisting conditions you may have.
 Taking your doctor's advice and your knowledge of your own body into account, write down some goals. It may help to plot out a fat loss schedule that you'll follow over the next six months. Set up some milestones you aim to reach along the way, to provide motivation for your weight loss journey.


Aim to lose 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) per week if you are of average weight. Losing more than that can be damaging to your body.Set goals that are reasonable and achievable. If you try to lose too much fat too fast, or more fat than is practical for you to lose, you'll end up feeling disappointed.
 Losing fat requires a lot of time, energy, and difficult choices. There will be times when you'll feel deprived of foods you love, or tired of feeling sore after exercising. Mental commitment is one of the most important factors in successful fat loss. Without it, you'll lapse into old habits, and you may even end up gaining back more than you initially lost.


Take a positive view of your body. Think of yourself as a strong, capable person with a body you can use to experience the world. Being thankful for your body's strengths will help motivate you to take good care of it.
On the other hand, if you tend to internally berate yourself for not looking the way you want to look, it's going to be harder to give your body the care and attention it needs to shed fat.

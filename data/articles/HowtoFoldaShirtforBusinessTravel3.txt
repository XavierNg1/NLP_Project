 Wrinkles in your shirt and other clothes are caused by friction between it and other items in your luggage. To minimize friction, save the plastic pouch that your shirt came in or any dry-cleaning bags. Once you’ve folded each shirt, slip it into a bag. Plastic limits the amount of friction created between two objects, so limit yourself to one shirt per bag, since two shirts rubbing up on each other will defeat the whole point.To reduce friction even further, use plastic when folding, too. Lay one dry-cleaner bag (or similarly sized sheet of plastic) over the back of your shirt before you begin. Then, once you finish folding your sleeves, lay another bag or sheet over them before you fold the shirt in half.For extra insurance against other items in your luggage, pack all your belongings in resealable plastic bags to protect your shirts and other clothes from friction, dirt, and spills.
 The longer a shirt is folded, the more time creases and other wrinkles have to set in. When packing ahead of time, hold off on your clothes for as long as you can without having to rush it. Once you arrive at your hotel, unpack your clothes and hang your shirts up on hangers first thing.To avoid packing in a rush, do a practice run before you clean and iron your shirts. Fold and bag them as you would when packing for real. Gather everything else you’re bringing with you and figure out the best way to arrange them in your luggage so you know exactly what to fit where ahead of time.
 Prevent your shirt and other items from flopping around inside your luggage by filling it all the way. If necessary, roll up extra t-shirts, socks, or other soft items to fill empty space, even if you won’t be needing them.At the same time, be careful not to cram too much in, since overstuffing will cause your packed items to squish into each other.This is another reason for doing a test-run with packing before cleaning and ironing your shirt.

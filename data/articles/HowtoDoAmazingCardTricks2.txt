 You will need a deck with two Jokers in it. Before the trick has begun, find both of the Jokers and place one on the top and one on the bottom of the deck. Now the trick is ready to be performed!, Ask a member of the audience to pick a card anywhere in the deck. Once they pick a card have them memorize the card. Ask them to show others, but tell them not to show you. Have the audience member place the memorized card on the top of the deck., Fan the deck out and ask the participant to tell you when to stop. When they say stop, split the deck. From whatever part you stopped at, take the bottom half and place it on top of the deck. Now their card is between both Jokers., Ask the contestant to wave their hand over the deck and say "Jokers find my card." Now flip the cards over and fan the cards out. Their card should be right in between the Jokers.


Pick up their card and ask if this is their card.

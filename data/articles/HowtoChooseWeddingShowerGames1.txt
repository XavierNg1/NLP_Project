 Create and print grids of 16 squares on card stock or sturdy paper, and then choose 24 words to randomly write on the cards. These words will answer questions you will ask about the bride or groom. Whoever gets four in a row wins! You can ask questions like:Where did the couple meet?
What did the groom study in college?
Where will the couple go on their honeymoon?;
, This game works like classic charades, but guests will mime classic wedding movies. Label blank cards with wedding movies and divide the group into two teams. Players take turns choosing a card and then acting out a scene from that film while being completely silent. Their team will have three minutes to guess the film their team member is acting out. You can include movies like:The Wedding Planner
Runaway Bride
My Best Friend's Wedding
Bride Wars
My Big Fat Greek Wedding

, Write wedding-related phrases, like tossing the bouquet, going on a honeymoon, removing the garter, on slips of paper. Place the slips in a bowl and position a whiteboard in the middle of the room. Divide the group into two teams. Each team’s appointed artist will pull a phrase from the bowl and have sixty seconds to draw it. If their own team can’t guess the correct phrase after sixty seconds, the other team gets a chance., Divide the guests into three groups. Give each group three rolls of toilet paper. Ask each group to appoint a dress model. Give each group fifteen minutes to create a wedding dress on the model. Let the guest of honor choose the winner.

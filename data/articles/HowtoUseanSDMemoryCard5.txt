 Your Windows Phone will prompt you to select where you want new files to be saved if you are inserting a new card.
 You can use Storage Sense to choose which apps you'd like to store on your SD card.

Tap "Apps + games".
Tap "Select" and then select all of the apps you want to move to your SD card.

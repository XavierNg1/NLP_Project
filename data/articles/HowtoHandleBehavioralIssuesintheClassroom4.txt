 This strategy should be used while students are misbehaving, or even after a lesson if approaching the situation would be even more distracting and is inconvenient in the middle of a lesson. It is important to not overreact during these situations, because that may cause students to enjoy the attention and continue the action for more attention.
 Move closer to the student or making eye contact directly with the student and use a signal such as a finger to the lips to signal to be quiet or to shake one's head back and forth (Evertson 137).Â This strategy is effective because it avoids confronting the student in front of the whole class abruptly while still providing a reminder for that student to get back on task.
 For example, "Thank you for getting out your books so quickly." The students will self-evaluate whether they are doing this or not, and the ones who aren't may decide that they should do so.
 Children may misbehave because they don't know how else to get what they want. Tell them what you'd like them to do instead, and why this is a better idea, and they may meet your positive expectations.


"You must keep your hands to yourself. It's rude to touch other people without their permission. If you need to flap your hands around, keep them to yourself, or go pick out a stim toy from the bin."
"It's not okay to scream indoors. Some people have sensitive ears and your screaming hurts them. If you want something, please take some deep breaths and ask for it with your words or with the picture binder."

, Tell them that you appreciate it, and that you are happy to see them communicating well. "Thank you for telling me that you need a drink so calmly! I'll go get you a cup of water."

, If you know why they're doing what they're doing, you can meet the need and teach them to communicate better. Once the children sense that you care about what they have to say (whether they say it "correctly" or not), they will open up.

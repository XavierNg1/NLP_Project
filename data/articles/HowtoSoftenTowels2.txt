 Ideally, do this on a cool day with a light breeze. Once the towel is dry, knead it with your hands as though it is a piece of dough or a hunk of meat. This should help to loosen up the stiffness.
 High heat will certainly make your towels fluffier, but it may also damage the integrity of the fabric. You can also alternate between air drying and high-heat tumble-drying. Try partially drying towels on the line, then finishing them up in the dryer for extra warmth and fluff.After drying, put the towel in for another round â€“ but select the wrinkle-free option, if available. This will fluff the towel, which should help soften the fabric.
 Give each towel a thorough shake when it comes out of the wash, and also when it comes out of the dryer. This should help keep the fabric fluffy.
 When you tumble-dry your towels, pop a few clean tennis balls or dryer balls into the mix before closing the door. As the dry cycle rumbles, the balls will bounce around and pummel your towels. This should work the fibers and help soften up the stiff bits.

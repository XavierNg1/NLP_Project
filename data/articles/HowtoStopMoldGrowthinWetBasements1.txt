 Moisture control is the key to solving mold problems.If you have a wet basement, you will need to find out what is causing the water issues before you treat the mold problem. Common culprits include:Defective gutters
Groundwater seepage
Poorly designed window wells
Ineffective subsurface drainage system
Cracks in a houseâ€™s foundation
Internal sources of humidity like humidifiers or frequent cooking;
, The mold problem in your basement may be the result of internal sources of moisture, rather than moisture entering the basement from outside. Remove humidifiers from the basement, and do not cook in the basement unless absolutely necessary. Make sure other sources of moisture, like the clothes dryer and bathroom, are properly ventilated., Your basement could be wet due to a leaking pipe, sink, or toilet. Carefully examine these potential sources of moisture. If you discover a leak, fix the problem as soon as possible. If necessary, seek professional help., After removing internal sources of moisture, evaluate the gutters, downspouts, and surface grading around the house. If it appears that moisture is entering the basement from these places, contact a professional to evaluate and correct the problem., After you address underlying issues, remove any remaining moisture. If there is standing water or a puddle, you can remove it with a utility pump, air mover, and/or mop. You can also use a dehumidifier to help remove excessive moisture from the air. Make sure you remove as much moisture as possible before treating the mold.

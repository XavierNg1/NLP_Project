 Jorrvaskr is the headquarters of the Companions. It’s the largest building found on the eastern side of Whiterun.;
, Go inside Jorrvaskr and head to the other end of the hall where you’ll find a door leading to the basement. Inside you’ll find an old man with long white hair and beard. Talk to him and he will introduce himself as Kodlak, the head of the guild. After introducing himself, tell Kodlak that you want to join the Companions.
 Before Kodlak accepts you, you must prove yourself first. Another Companion member with long dark hair and shadowed eyes will approach you and tell you to follow him. This is Vilkas. Follow him to the training grounds outside Jorrvaskr.
 In order to prove yourself, you must defeat Vilkas in a fight. Take out your sword or axe, and take a swing at Vilkas. Do not use any other weapons like bows and arrows, or magic spells because this is against the rule of the fight.
 After a few swings at Vilkas, he will give you his sword and ask you to have it sharpen. Take the stairs on the right side of the Jorrvaskr (right beside the training grounds) all the way up to the forge where you’ll find an old man named Eorlund Gray-Mane.


Give Eorlund Vilkas’s sword to have it sharpen, and he will hand you a shield and ask you to take it to a member named Aela.
 Go back to the basement of Jorrvaskr where you’ll find a female Companion member walking around the hallway. This is Aela the Huntress. Talk to her and hand over her shield back to her.
 After giving Aela her shield back, she will call another Companion member named Farkas to escort you to your room. Follow Farkas to the other end of the basement where your room is. After showing you your room, Farkas will congratulate you and welcome you to the Companions.

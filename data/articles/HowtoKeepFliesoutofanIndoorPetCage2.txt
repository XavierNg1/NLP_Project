 Especially if your pet eats fruit or veggies – or mammals, for that matter – keep these foods and the materials your use to prepare them away from your pet’s cage. Keep fruit in your kitchen, where you’ll be able to keep it fresh longer, and dispose of any fruit that you don’t refrigerate as soon as it shows signs of age.Be careful to remove and wash dishes with which you feed your pet a short time after feeding. This is somewhat dependent on the type of food you pet eats, but fruit in particular calls for cleaning later that same day.
 Flies are out there, lurking in the wild just beyond the walls of your home, and waiting for a chance to enter. Stay diligent about keeping access points closed from disallowing the entrance of flies into you and pet’s domain. Alternatively, if you prefer to have windows and doors open, keep your pet in a room that will always be sealed from the exterior, at least via entirely undamaged screens.
 In general, the cooler and drier you keep an indoor pet cage, the fewer flies you'll get. If it's especially warm in the room where you keep your pet, consider keeping the pet in a different room or doing what you can to cool the room where they live.
 It’s a well-known fact that flies are attracted to garbage. Keep garbage receptacles in different rooms, to prevent flies that are attracted by garbage from occupying your pet’s tank as well. Relatedly, dispose of fruit in particular by either bringing it outside or putting it in a garbage disposal.

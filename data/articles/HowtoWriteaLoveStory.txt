 Uniqueness is like salt. Just enough can perfect a dish, but too much can ruin it and make you regret even making it. Creativity on the other hand is fine. But save the fear factor for your horror stories, unless you can work the violence seamlessly into the romance.



Do not match personality. There can be some similarities between the two lovers, but don't overdo it. If they are too similar, the reader will began to regard them more as siblings or close friends than lovers.
Anger, rivalry, and love? Both anger and love take a lot of passion and in the end they can spawn off each other. In the beginning stages of your story do not be afraid to let them loathe each other, just subdue the fire before it escalates.
Combinations. We have all heard of the epitome of "unique" lovers: mean/hotheaded guy and nice, plain girl or vice versa, and smart guy and empty headed but cool girl or vice versa. Try to go beyond that. Make two lists of all the personalities you can think of, one for the girl and one for the guy. Then chose a random trait from each list and see if can make a story off that.
 Symbolism is a difficult art to master, but if you can represent your characters' love through a material object, the readers will enjoy it. A common example is a rose, but try to venture into some more unique objects. Think of why your characters love each other and focus in on those reasons; maybe you can come up with the ideal symbol.
 What do an envying ex, a malicious villain, and feuding parents have in common? They are all classic examples of the romantic equivalent of an antagonist. An antagonist can provide strife, angst, and even comical relief. They are very rewarding and enjoyable to create. Who doesn't want to make the perfect villain?

 Add some of your dish soap to the can and rinse it out well with water. This helps remove any of the sticky residue from the can’s contents. After you cut off the top of the can, you’ll have a chance to check for any leftover food or drink and wash the can again.;
, To make the candle, you need to remove the top part of the can. One way to do this is with a pointed or sharp kitchen knife. If it’s a drink can, place the point in the groove between the rim of the can and the opening.Keep the can on the table and the knife pointed into it to avoid getting poked. Children should have an adult do this for them.
Larger aluminum cans are often open enough that you can fit in the candle and avoid cutting.
 Use a household hammer to gently tap the knife and force it into the aluminum. Repeat this around the edge of the can until you can remove the can’s top. If there are sharp edges, use the edge of a knife or sandpaper. Rub the knife or sandpaper over it to smooth down the edges.


Another way to cut the can is to make a slice on the outside using an x-acto knife and then cut around with scissors, but beware of sharp edges.
 A can used for a candle can be decorated in many ways. One way is to first poke holes in a pattern using a nail and then coat the can in spray paint. You can then drop in a small candle to get a patterned light. Another option is to cut the can into a large circle and smaller petals, gluing them into a flower. This kind of decoration can be used as a base to hold a candle.Use a tea candle or LED light to avoid heating the can while in use.
Cans with the tops cut off and decorated can also be used as pencil holders.

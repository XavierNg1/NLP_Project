 Traditionally, people make syrniki from a fresh, soft cheese sold as "tvorog" in Eastern European delis (or simply "syr," meaning cheese). In Western grocery stores, the closest option is usually a firm "curd cheese," "farmer's cheese," or "quark." In a pinch, you can use ricotta or dry cottage cheese. You can even make your own cottage cheese and press out the moisture to get tvorog.Tvorog tends to be a little tangier and less salty than Western curd cheese.Skip the extra salt in this recipe if you're using a salty cheese.;
, Mash 1 cup (240 mL) cheese with a fork or pulse in the blender until the curds are in small pieces., Beat the egg in a large bowl. Add the cheese, 6 tbsp (50 g) flour, 3 tbsp (40 g) sugar, Â½ tsp (2.5 mL) vanilla, and a dash of salt. Mix thoroughly until the ingredients are well mixed and the batter holds together in a loose lump, similar to thick pancake batter.








You may need to add extra flour if using a wet cheese.
 Heat about 1 tbsp (15 mL) of oil in a medium sized skillet over medium high heat. The oil is hot enough when it makes a sprinkle of flour sizzle., While waiting for the oil to heat up, separate the batter into balls that fit on your palm. Coat each ball in flour and flatten it gently into a thick, round patty, similar to an American pancake., It only takes a couple minutes on each side to cook these pancakes. The outside should be golden brown and slightly crispy from the flour coating, while the inside stays soft, fluffy, and cheesy.









Add a little more oil to the pan between each batch of syrniki.
 Serve the syrniki hot and enjoy with a garnish of sour cream, fruit jam, fresh fruit, applesauce, or honey.

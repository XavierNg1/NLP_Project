 Most businesses are generally either arranged horizontally or vertically. Horizontally means the structure of power is spread out among employees. A vertical structure means that the power in the company is primarily hierarchical, moving from general employees to middle managers and then to top managers.In a horizontal system, more employees are empowered to make decisions. It can lead to more mistakes, but decisions also happen more quickly. In a vertical system, you must go up the structure of power for a decision to be made.;
, One way to organize your chart is to arrange it by department. It doesn't matter whether your company divides into departments by products, functions, or locations. You can use the major departments, then sub-divide into divisions within those departments., Another way to arrange an organizational chart is by your employees. Use your employees' names, and organize your chart by the connections they have to one another. This type of chart works well for both horizontal and vertical power structures, as you can draw lines to show relationships however you want.Keep in mind that you can also use a hybrid of a departmental and employee chart. Make the chart fit your needs.
 If you're doing an employee-based chart, you'll need the names of employees, their titles, and their relationships to one another. Add their employee number if you'd like. For a departmental chart, collect the names of all the departments and how they relate to one another.

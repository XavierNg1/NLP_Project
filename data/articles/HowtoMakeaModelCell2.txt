 To make a cell out of jello, you will need:Lemon flavored jello, or unflavored jello
Light colored fruit juice (if using unflavored jello)
Various candies and fruits, such as: raisins, gummy worms (plain and sour), gumdrops, jelly beans, grapes, mandarin orange sections, sprinkles, M&M's, jaw breakers, dried fruit, and/or hard candy. Avoid using marshmallows, as they will float on top of the gelatin.
Water
A large plastic resealable bag
A spoon
A large bowl or container
Access to a stovetop or microwave
Access to a refrigerator

, This will make the jello stiffer and make it easier for the cell parts to stay in place.Heat the water to boiling, using Â¾ of what is called for in the instructions. Dissolve the gelatin in the hot water and stir it carefully. Add the same amount of cold water to the mixture.
If you are using unflavored jello, add fruit juice to the jello in place of water so the jello is a light, bright color.
The jello will represent the cytoplasm of the cell.
 Slowly pour the cooled gelatin into the bag.


Make sure there is room in the bag for all the cell components that will be added in later.
Seal the bag and put it in the refrigerator.
 Then, take the bag out of the refrigerator and open it.
 Make sure you use candies that are the right color and shape to match the components of an actual cell.


Keep in mind that if you are making a plant cell, you will need to add in a cell membrane around the jello with candy such as Twizzlers or Pixie Sticks.
 You may want to make a card with a piece of each candy glued to the card, or you can create labels by writing or typing the name of the cell part and attaching them to each candy.
 This will allow the jello to fully set, creating a sturdy cell model.


Feel to free to take a picture of the jello model, and then eat it!

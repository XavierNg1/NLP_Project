 If your dress was bought off the rack, is there a label? What does it suggest? Alternatively, return to the store where you purchased the dress from and ask them for their specific advice about your dress. Most contemporary, modern wedding dresses are fine being dry cleaned and in fact, should be dry cleaned prior to storage.;
, If you've inherited a vintage or antique wedding dress, be aware that it is very unlikely to be suitable for dry cleaning. Fabric weakens with time and exposure to the elements, especially air and dampness. Moreover, older fabrics were not made to withstand tough chemical cleaning processes and tend to be delicate. Unless you know the quality of the fabric can withstand dry cleaning, err on the side of hand and spot cleaning instead.


If you have an antique gown, speak to a conservator about its care and cleaning.
 Embellishments on modern wedding dresses tend to be glued on unless the dress is very expensive or only contains a very small portion of embellishments. Glued-on items can easily loosen or pull away with the heat and chemicals of dry cleaning. Yet, even if the embellishments have been hand-sewn on, the nature of the decorations may not be able to handle the chemicals of dry cleaning solutions, which act as solvents.


Embellishments include beads, pearls, sequins, buttons, etc.
 Your dry cleaner may be able to suggest options for your dress that you're not aware of. On the whole, most wedding dresses can be dry cleaned but it's better to know than to ruin a beautiful dress.

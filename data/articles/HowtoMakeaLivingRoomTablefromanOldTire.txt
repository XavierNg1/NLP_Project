 While the tire treads will have no bearing on whether the tire will make for a sturdy base, you will want to ensure that the tire is intact and has no large rips or holes.


Scrub well with dish soap and a scrub brush. Consider doing this outside, preferably near your garden hose.






Hose off soap and debris.






Repeat if necessary.






Allow time for the tire to dry completely before starting your craft.

, Use your measuring tape to obtain the measurements of the tire opening to ascertain the plywood size. You will be cutting out a circular piece for the top.


Mark the measurements directly on the plywood using a pencil and then use the jigsaw to cut to fit. Don’t forget to wear your safety glasses when using the jigsaw.
 Instead of designing the bottom to match the top exactly, take the measurements of the tire’s diameter and then subtract 2 inches (5.1 cm). You will be creating a circular piece for the bottom as well.


Cut piece from the plywood and set aside.
 Using the plywood bottom, determine the spacing before you secure them in place. Position the legs in different areas of the tire bottom to see which placement has the best balance.


Use wood glue to secure the legs to the table bottom. Make sure wood glue has completely dried before adding screws.






Secure by drilling the legs to the plywood bottom and then secure them with L brackets.



Start with the bottom piece and use an ample amount of glue for both pieces.
 All wood pieces should have a few coats of stain or paint. Now is a good time to get a little creative and you can apply a variety of paint and stain techniques to the wood or just add a few smooth coats of stain to create a refined look.
 Apply construction adhesive to a small section of the tire and then (working quickly) wind the rope around the perimeter.


Wind tightly so you can no longer identify the base as being a tire.

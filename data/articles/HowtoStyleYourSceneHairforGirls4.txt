Use a comb to pull your bangs up and out for a little extra volume. #*Spray when necessary to keep it in place.
 Starting from near the scalp, take sections of hair along the side of your head and tease them a little so they don't lay flat.



Tease your hair so that each piece puffs out differently.
Use your hands and a comb to sculpt each piece separately.
Don't be afraid to play with each piece and redo them if you're not happy with the results.

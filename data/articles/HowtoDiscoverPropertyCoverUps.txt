 Not many people look at their roof on a regular basis so watch for rusty metal that has been painted, tiles patched with lead or damaged roof framing propped up in the roof space.
 Check for damp that will affect timber sub-floor or stumps, or floors that are temporarily propped to prevent bouncing.

 These need to be professionally checked and replaced or repaired immediately.

 You may want to look for a ribbon that matches your outfit or has an interesting texture like velvet or a raised pattern.






;
, To make a standard size bow, use about 12 inches of ribbon. If youâ€™d like to make a smaller or larger bow, use less than 12 inches or a bit more than 12 inches of ribbon.
 You may want to tie your hair up or back with a hair tie to make sure your hair is secure.









Feel free to also create two braids on either side of your head and add ribbons to the ends.
 If you used a hair tie, slip the ribbon around the hair tie so it is covered with the ribbon.
 Pull both sides of the ribbon so there is a tight knot in the center of your hair, or in the center of the hair tie.
 Similar to how you would tie your shoe laces, create two loops and tie them together to form a bow.
 Check that the loops are the same size on either side of the bow and that it sits straight on your head.









Apply hairspray or hair gel to get rid of any fly aways and ensure your hair looks sleek and tidy.
 Bows can be difficult to keep in place, especially if you're dealing with a fussy child who doesn't like anything on their head. Try placing a dab of KY Jelly or Karo syrup under the center tie of the bow to secure it.








You can also try placing a dab of the jelly or the syrup in the middle of the knot before you tie the bow.

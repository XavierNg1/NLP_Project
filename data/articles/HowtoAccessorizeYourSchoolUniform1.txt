 Earrings can draw attention to your face and are a fun way to differentiate your uniform’s look. Experiment with different styles, such as studs, chandelier-style earrings, hoops or geometric earrings. You can also play with different materials, such as metals or acrylics, or different colors, to find the perfect combination that suits you.Select earrings that match your personality. If you are loud and love to make jokes, maybe bright color hoops, such as neon pink, would suit you.
If you’re a romantic, perhaps lace-appliqué earrings would best showcase who you are.;
, Layer lots of thin bracelets in different metals to add texture to your look. Wearing multiple chunky jewelry pieces can make your appearance seem sloppy. Opt for thin bracelets you can mix and match in silver, gold and bronze tones.A three-quarter sleeve uniform top could be matched with a thin gold finger bracelet and lots of bangles for a pretty and unexpected look.
 Wear a statement necklace with a shape that mimics that of your uniform neckline. If your school uniform has a blouse with a round collar, for example, try a statement necklace with a rounded shape. Whether you prefer a statement necklace that is thick, very colorful, or both, opt for just one rather than layering several, which can be distracting.A navy V-neck sweater could look nice with a V-shaped statement necklace in gold.
A khaki uniform dress with a square collar might look nice with a bib necklace in olive green.
 Use the face or strap of a watch to highlight a color in your uniform. This will make the whole look cohesive but also more interesting. Or, if your uniform colors are very drab, add some pop by selecting a watch in a fun color you love.If your uniform skirt is a green, blue and red plaid, you could wear a watch with a red strap to highlight that tone.
If your uniform is white and tan, you could choose a watch with a purple face to provide interest and contrast.

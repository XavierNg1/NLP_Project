When you are not distracted by the demands of others on your time, your mind opens up to greater possibilities.Being alone is a great time to brainstorm a new business idea, write a novel, develop a new song, make pottery, improve your photography skills, and so on. Even if you do not work in an obvious creative field, you can still benefit from this creativity boost.
 Although you can pursue passions and interests with others, you can also have fun pursuing them alone. Whatever it is that makes you feel relaxed and happy, do it by yourself. This brings with it the added value of allowing you to relax and de-stress on your own. You can also do things that maybe your friends or partner are not interested in or do not have time to join in on.

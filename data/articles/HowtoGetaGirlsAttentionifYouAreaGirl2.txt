 Tell a slightly inappropriate joke about gays or lesbians and watch for a reaction (don't get too nasty, you're just trying to gauge the response). What you're trying to do is determine if she's bigoted or has a negative feeling about gays in general, or if she seems to be okay with everything. Be sure the joke is funny so you both can laugh over it if there's just a neutral response from her.;
, Approach her often, spur conversations in that direction (girls with girls) and let her know, "That sounds like fun." Or, the ever-popular, "I've never tried it but it doesn't sound bad".
 Ask or tell about your current girlfriends. This requires you to come out and identify yourself as bisexual or lesbian.
 Ask her if she has a girlfriend or if she's ever had one. If she corrects you ("You mean "boyfriend?"), then say "Oops - what did I say? Silly me." and smile.

 Choose a spot that your dog is familiar with, and that has very few distractions, to start training.Start with short, fifteen minute sessions to avoid overwhelming the dog. Illustrate commands with gestures and reward your dog's success at following commands with praise, treats, and other positive reinforcement., Once your dog is skilled at a few basic obedience commands (e.g. "sit", "stay" and "lie down"), practice these commands in areas with more distractions. This may seem repetitive or unnecessary, but it is an important step to ensure that your dog understands these commands beyond the environment it learned them in. For obedience training that is environment-specific (i.e. staying seated in the car), it is important to practice with your dog in that specific context., Discouraging bad behavior is important, but it is more important to avoid instilling fear or distrust in a dog. Avoid any measures that use intimidation or harm to get a dog to behave (e.g. hitting it, dragging it by the leash, using a shock collar).To convey your disapproval, use a strong, firm tone of voice and employ low-stress negative reinforcement - as a punishment, take something away from your dog, like a treat or toy. Dogs naturally seek guidance, which is better conveyed by confident leadership than by aggressive reinforcement., Dogs learn through the repeated process of commands and consequences, so it is important to stay consistent on this front. Commands, non-verbal communication, and rewards should stay the same to create a foundation of trust and obedience. Always be as clear and direct as possible, and try to establish a regular schedule and procedure for training, eating, grooming, and so on.

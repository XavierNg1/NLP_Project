 Its maybe time to involve ebay?

, Contact Seller and ask (only if you are uncertain about places they will ship and uncertain of shipping cost and combined shipping as well. Providing your address ans Zip Code,Postal code should make it clear to the seller.Once you receive your quote save it in your mail if you win they need to honour that quote.At least this way you,ll know where you stand and you won,t get hit with extremely high shipping fees.Example {if you win a .99 item or a very low cost item you won,t get a surprise shipping fee of $65.00 U.S. for a few pieces of jewelry) this happens frequently.Needs to be reasonable shipping and if it does happen to you report it to EBAY.

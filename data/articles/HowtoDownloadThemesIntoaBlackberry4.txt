 You will need to download the theme creation program, which is available for free. Be aware that the program does not support all devices. Check the website to make sure that your device is compatible.


The Theme Studio will allow you to customize the background, icons, fonts, and much more.
 Click File, and then select New. Give your new theme a name, and select the model BlackBerry that you are creating the theme for. Click the Create button.
 Once you have started your project, you will be greeted with a picture of the phone you are theming, a list of icons representing the various aspects of the interface. Clicking each button will open the editor for that section.
 Use the editor to add new backgrounds and icons, as well as change fonts. You can customize the battery indicator, create animations, and much more.


Icons and backgrounds will need to be specific sizes, otherwise the theme may not work on the phone. Inspect existing images to use as guidelines for your image sizes.

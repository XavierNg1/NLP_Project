 The calming back-and-forth motion that a rocking chair or glider affords is a nice addition to any nursery. Make sure you take the time to visit a store and find one that’s a good fit for you and your baby., When seeking out a rocking chair or glider, go for one that is constructed of solid wood. If your budget allows, go for a hardwood option like cherry or walnut. These woods are durable and will stand up to regular rocking and gliding., A dense cushion means it’s less likely to lump up after regular use. Aim for cushions covered in dark, woven fabrics that won’t fray. Make sure the back cushions, seat cushions, and arms are supportive and high-padded.Opt for easy to clean cushions and wood finishes.
 Many rocking chairs and gliders are custom made. This means they often are not available for immediate shipment. Make sure you place your order at least ten weeks, preferably more, before your infant is due to arrive.

 Try a bead on a string. Sunflower seeds work well too. Just wave the bead/food around your budgie and they will try to catch it. When they do, give it a treat.;
, Don't expect the bird to catch a fly right away! Just try using food or the bead!

, Don't give them a big one, give them one they can eat.
 If their wings aren't clipped, that is a good thing as they will chase it around. If they have been clipped, they will just walk around chasing it.
 Seed works well, but they will eat the fly.

 This expansive genre encompasses a huge range of topics. A Gothic poem can be about anything. It's just a dark twist. Stereotypically, Gothic poetry is about pain, death and tragic love. This isn't always true. So don't let yourself be fooled by stereotypes.;
, The title is one of the most important parts of Gothic poetry. It helps the reader gather the emotion of the poem before they read it, and to understand the poem while reading it. A good title will catch the person's eye. Just make sure you can keep their attention afterward. It's a good idea to keep the title short, either words or syllables.
 Anything goes in this step, as you'll soon revise it. Keep it consistent with the title. Then add some supporting verses after you know what your outline might look like. A short example: "my twisted soul can no longer fly/darkness rips at my blinding eyes"

, Some poems actually come across stronger when words aren't capitalized except for the names of God, people, and places.
 Another stereotype is that punctuation is absent from Gothic poetry. But that's not true. Any poem, no matter the genre, would do well with punctuation.
 If you wish to rhyme then great! Don't TRY to make your poem rhyme though. The rhyming should always come by itself. Trying to rhyme is forcing it to rhyme, and the poem won't flow and it'll be... well not a good poem. If you want it to rhyme but have to force rhymes, then do so, but revise revise revise!

, Do what you wish with the design of the poem. But make sure it's comfortable to you and you can work with it. Remember: free verse has little or no rhyme!

, It doesn't matter how long a poem is, but it does matter how you shape it. A most preferred style is column. You can also make it the left or right side of your page.

 Keep the same colors together to prevent the Play-Doh dyes from mixing and forming a brownish color. Play-Doh is mostly made of flour, water, and salt, so adding life back to the hardened dough can be as simple as adding back the water that’s evaporated.


If your Play-Doh has been out for an extended period of time (more than a couple months) and has fully hardened, it may not be possible to revive it.;
, Massage the wet ball in your hands, working the water into the dough. Continue sprinkling the ball with water and massaging it., Once the dough has absorbed a sufficient amount of water and has become moist and malleable again, knead it on a countertop for a few minutes, until it has returned to its original form. Sprinkle it with more water as you’re kneading, if necessary.


Try kneading one-half teaspoon of glycerine into the Play-Doh to help moisten it further., Play-Doh will dry out when it’s exposed to air, so store it in an air-tight container. Consider wrapping it in a re-sealable plastic bag first.

 For this recipe, you'll need a big bowl, a fork or wooden spoon, a saucepan or a stew pot, and something to put your fritters on.;
, You'll need vegetable or canola oil, Krusteaz buttermilk pancake mix, milk, an egg, and any chopped fruit or spices you want.
 There isn't really a specific ratio or measurement for the mix and milk, it depends on how many fritters you're making. You want the dough to be much thicker than pancake batter (think biscuit dough), so keep that in mind and don't worry too much, go with your instincts.
 Now is the time to stir in any apples, berries, cinnamon, or nutmeg in your fritters. The possibilities are endless, so feel free to get creative.
 You want your pot or pan about 3/4 full of oil. Get it on the burner and bring it to a slow, rolling boil.
 Get some dough in a ball about 2 to 2 1⁄2 inches (5.1 to 6.4 cm) around. It doesn't have to be smooth and perfect, in fact it shouldn't be. It should look like a sticky, spiky ball of awesome dough.
 GENTLY put the dough ball in the oil (you can fit about 3 at a time in a saucepan, more in a pot). When it floats to the top, turn it over. The fritters are finished when they are golden brown.
 Boiling oil is dangerous, so use tongs and be very, very careful, because it hurts really, bad to be burnt by that stuff.
 Fritters are delicious, and something that definitely should be shared. Get some friends or family around and make fritters together. They're guaranteed to help bonding. No one can stay sad or angry when they're eating fritters.

 Squirrels usually would chew through roof vents, exhaust pipes, roofline, side vents, and soffits. Check these areas first. When you find the entry hole, make note of its location.

If you can't find the hole or a part of the roof is inaccessible, check inside the attic during the day. You would usually see the light shining in through the hole on the roof.;
, If there are any babies, place them in a box and place it outside close to the entry hole (they will be reunited with their mother later), Removal Kits come with S33 one-way exit door, protective screening (16 gauge galvanized steel mesh), exit door replacement screening, zip-ties, screws, washers and instruction manual., Cover the entry hole with the protective screening. Use the screws and washers to fasten it. Cut a 3" by 3" hole exactly over the hole and install the one way door over it using the zip ties. You have done most of the work. Sit back and watch as the squirrels leave and cannot get back in. During baby season, place the box containing the babiesâ€™ right by the hole. This will allow the mother squirrel to find and relocate her young to a secondary den. Give it anywhere from 24 to 48 hours for the removal process to be complete., A day after you installed the kit, it should be all quite. You should not hear any scratching or running noises. This means that the squirrel has left. After you confirm the squirrel is gone, replace the one way door with the replacement screening provided. This secures the area against animal re-entry. Congratulations, you have successfully removed the nuisance squirrels without having to come in contact with them.

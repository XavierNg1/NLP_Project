 Purchase loose white face powder, talcum powder or cornstarch. Pour the powder into a bowl and dip a makeup sponge or brush into the powder., Begin graying your hair by brushing the hair along your temples with the sponge or brush, reapplying the powder when needed. Even though the powder is white, the natural color of your hair will come through to make your hair look like itâ€™s gray.If you want a subtly older look, just brushing the powder at the temples is enough to make you look older and grayer, since people tend to go gray first around the temples.
Focus on working the powder from the roots of your hair up, especially around the hair that frames your face. Since hair naturally greys from the roots up, this will give it a more realistic appearance.
Make sure to avoid getting powder on your face. Brush away powder with a wet cloth if you get it on your forehead or neck.
 If you want a dramatic, all-over white look, sprinkle powder over your hair. Do this by leaning back over the sink and sprinkling a pinch of powder over your hair. You may want to drape a towel around your shoulders, as this can be a messy process and powder will likely fall onto your shoulders., After you sprinkle the powder on the top of your head, use your fingers to work the powder through your hair, starting at the top of your head and spreading the powder down your hair shaft.
 Once you have finished working the powder through your hair, spray your hair liberally with hairspray to set the powder.White powder should wash out after a thorough shampooing of your hair.

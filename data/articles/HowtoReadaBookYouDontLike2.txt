 Consider only reading a portion a day if you have time. This will allow you to learn a little each day with fewer days of non-studying to forget what you learned.


When you go back to reading, plan to review. Take a few minutes to look back at what you read previously to remind yourself what you learned last time. This will help you avoid getting stuck by forgetting previous material.
 The last thing you want to do is push yourself beyond your limits. If you find your pacing is too quick, take a break. Work these breaks into your pacing if possible. Maybe take a day or two off during the week instead of reading every day.
 Sometimes what is important is not to read word-for-word but to understand the concepts. If you focus on reading word-for-word you may sometimes miss the overarching themes. Skim the material and focus on learning concepts and themes when possible.
 One of the best ways to avoid this is to take copious notes. Write out definitions and concepts. Memorize them in your spare time.


Most textbooks will provide a Glossary with definitions for key terms and concepts. Use this Glossary whenever you run across a term you are unfamiliar with. If you find yourself forget that term frequently, make a flash card and quiz yourself until you know the term's meaning by heart.
 Finding a study group can be a boon to your understanding in a class. Where you fail to understand a topic, they often can help you out. Likewise, when they do not understand, you can teach them. This will help both of you to better understand the material.

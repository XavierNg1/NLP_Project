 Locate the app on your home screen or app drawer and tap on it.
 After the app loads, it will ask the user to either sign in or create a new account. Tap “Register,” and finish signing up by filling in the required fields.
 A small pop-up box will open and ask you to agree or disagree to the Terms and Conditions. Tap “I Agree” to continue.
 The next screen will have a search bar on it. Type in the first 3 digits of a local area code and the search will do the rest. Once the search is complete, select a number by tapping the option all the way on the right of the number you want.
 After selecting a number, all calls going out from the device will appear as the number that had been selected from the search list. Immediately after this page, the application will take you to a simple dial pad. Enter in a number, and hit the gray phone icon in the bottom center of the page.


To use the contacts list already on the device, select the “People” tab at the top of the page. Tap on a contact and hit “Dial” to call.
Once you’ve finished the call, just tap “End.”

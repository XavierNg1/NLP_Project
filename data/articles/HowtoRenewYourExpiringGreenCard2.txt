You are eligible to apply for a Permanent Resident green card within 90 days of the 2-year expiration date., Do not use Form I-90. If you are a permanent resident who was granted conditional permanent resident status, you need to file a petition to remove those conditions.If your conditional status was based on a marriage, file Form I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence.If your conditional status was based on being an investor or entrepreneur, file Form I-829, Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Status.Filing instructions and forms are available on the USCIS web site at www.uscis.gov.
If you do not file the petition to remove the conditions before your card expires, you may lose your permanent resident status.

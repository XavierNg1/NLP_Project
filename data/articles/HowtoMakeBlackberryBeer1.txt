 Easily the most popular beer style to brew with berries is hefeweizen. The mild, yeasty flavor of this wheat-based beer make it the ideal backdrop for the bright, sweet flavor of blackberries. Other wheat styles, such as Belgian whites, also work well.;
, Blackberries also work well in rich, roasted beer styles like porter and stout. The smoky, chocolate flavors of these beers pair effortlessly with fresh berries, just as you might combine these flavors in a dessert.
 Note that adding fruit to a beer will impair its visual clarity, which is another reason why thick, cloudy hefeweizens and stouts make good pairings. Adding blackberries to a crystal clear pilsner, for example, will mar its appearance.

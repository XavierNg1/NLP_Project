 Itâ€™s the yellow icon with a white ghost on your home screen (iPhone/iPad) or in the app drawer (Android).
 This is where your Snaps wind up when you save them.
 A menu will appear.,, The sharing options vary by device, but you should see any social media apps you have installed, email, and messaging apps, plus the option to save to a cloud account (like iCloud, Dropbox, or Google Drive).


Selecting a social media app (e.g. Facebook, Instagram) will open that app. Use its tools to post the Snap as a photo or video on your feed.
Select your email app to attach your Snap to an email message, or your messaging app to include it in a text message.

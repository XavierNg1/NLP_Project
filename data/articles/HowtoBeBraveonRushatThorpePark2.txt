 This enables you to get massive airtime on the peaks of the swings, where you drift weightlessly in your seat.
 If you look at it, the arm nearest the entrance tends to swing lower and less then the other. Ask the ride host to go on the further arm.
 This makes your body easier to move round in the seat, again, giving you more airtime.
 When you are facing down, look down. This gives you a nervous sensation of adrenaline through your body and makes the ride experience more thrilling, as it feels like you are hanging in mid-air and are about to crash back down to the floor.

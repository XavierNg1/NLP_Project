 By doing this first, you will be able to dislodge dirt and dust that is clinging deep within the rug.This should be done using a vacuum with a beater bar. Stand on top of the rug and use your feet to prevent the edges from flipping up as you vacuum along them.









Alternatively, you and a friend can flip the shag rug upside down and shake it vigorously to shake off dirt and dust. Shag rugs are abnormally heavy, however, so this will be difficult for you to do alone.
 Roll the shag rug up and set it aside for a moment. There should be dirt and dust on the floor that you dislodged earlier. Vacuum these up then place your rug back where it was, this time face up.
 Unlike the underside, vacuums with beater bars are not recommended for use on the topside, as the long fibers will wrap around them and cause damage to the vacuum. Using a vacuum with high suction can also cause damage by pulling the tufts out of the carpet. Instead, use a smaller vacuum with low suction or use the crevice tool to gently clean the topside.

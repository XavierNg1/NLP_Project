 It can be difficult to cut out junk food if other people in your life aren’t supporting your decision. Let your family, friends, and anybody you live with know that you are trying to cut out junk food. Ask them not to tempt you with foods you are trying to avoid.Let them know that you are not judging their eating habits. You are simply asking them to respect the changes you are making in your own diet.
If anyone you spend time with persists in trying to get you to eat unhealthy snacks, you may need to confront them about it. Explain how you feel politely, but be firm. If that doesn’t work, you may need to avoid spending time with them for a while.
 It’s easier and more fun to make a change in your lifestyle if you’re doing it with a friend. If you have a friend, family member, or significant other who is also interested in cutting back on junk food, talk to them about the changes you are making.Share tips with your diet buddy. For example, if you have a recipe for a healthy snack that you really enjoy, let them know about it.
You can also compare notes about your progress and pitfalls, and reach out to each other when one of you is feeling tempted to fall back into old habits.
 If you’re really having a hard time breaking your junk food habit, and it’s causing you distress or affecting your health, talk to a health care professional.Your doctor may be able to refer you to a dietitian who can help you set appropriate goals for yourself.
If you have a junk food addiction with underlying emotional causes, a counselor might be able to help you address the issues that are contributing to your junk food habit.

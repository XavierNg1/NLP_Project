 Only request a song when the band has asked the audience to do so. Many times, they will not as they already have a setlist that they try to follow. Don't be 'that guy/girl' and ruin the show for everyone else.
 Everyone is there to enjoy themselves, just like you are. If in the mosh pit and the people around you start jumping up and down, go with it. If you stand still you are likely to get knocked around and annoy those dancing by you. If seated, stand only if everyone else is standing. There is nothing worse then having your view blocked by the person in front of you.
 In mosh pit situations you will make contact with other people's limbs, drinks and handbags. Take it with a grain of salt. If you get whacked on the head by a flailing arm, ignore it. Same goes for those in the seats, accept that the leg room is minimal and that knees will press from time to time into your back. It is nothing personal. Same also goes for General Admission.
 If someone mistakes you for the guy who shoved them roughly out of the way and punches you in the stomach, ignore it. There is nothing to gain by retaliating unless you are sure that you will not be the one to come off worse. But if someone continues to harass you, go to a security guard and leave the area.
 Even if you are an amazing singer, no one paid to come and hear you.
 Save the talking about your day between sets or until after the concert. Don't have long, loud conversations about things that are completely irrelevant to the show.
 You may not like them or feel they compliment the sound of your idols, but they're there for a reason, too.
 If they aren't crowd surfing you shouldn't be either.

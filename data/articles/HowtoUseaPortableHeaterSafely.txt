Check the product specifications for the square feet a portable heater is rated for in order to maximize heater safety.
Using a space heater that is too large can discharge air pollutants and use lots of energy.
Using a space heater that is too small may lead to the device overheating.



A tip-over safety switch shuts off a space heater in the event it is accidentally knocked over.
A temperature sensor protects against overheating by automatically switching off a space heater when it becomes too hot.



Gas heaters are fueled by natural gas, propane, butane, or kerosene. Never use a fuel that is not approved for your heater.
These fuels can produce dangerous levels of carbon monoxide and other unhealthy gases if not properly vented.
Portable gas heaters should be vented so that exhaust fumes are expelled outside.
Let a heater cool down before filling and be careful not to overfill.

Damp locations like a bathroom or basement can cause problems with heater safety.

Don't plug other electrical devices into the same outlet as the space heater.
Verify that a plug and outlet have a good fit to avoid overheating.

If you have no other choice but to use an extension cord, use a heavy-duty one with at least 14-gauge wire.
 Space heaters should never be unattended.

 In order to figure out how much you need to raise your grade with a point system, you will first need to decide what letter grade you want in the class overall and what the corresponding percentage is (you can use the chart below).


Next, use this percentage to determine how many points, out of the total number of available points in the class, are necessary to earn this percentage.
Compare the number of points youâ€™re already earned against how many points are needed to get the grade you want. Compare that number against the point count for the work you have not yet done. If the number of points available is small than the number of points needed to gain that grade, you will not be able to achieve the grade you want without some form of extra credit.
 Calculating what you will need to do to raise a weighted grade is much more difficult, since there are so many different factors. The easiest method will be to ask your teacher for help and advice.


You will want to focus on doing better in the categories which are more heavily weighted. This will raise your grade faster than focusing on the lesser categories. However, if those more lightly weighted categories are easy to raise (such as regular attendance to raise a participation grade), then you certainly should not ignore them.
 Extra credit for either grading system will help raise your grade. The more the extra work is worth, the more it will do to raise your grade. However, if your teacher uses weighted grades and puts extra credit in a less weighted category, this will help less. Ask your teacher how extra credit is counted before taking on too much.

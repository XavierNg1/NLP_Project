 Disney does not offer physical collections of many of their shows, but some of them are available from retailers. Search Amazon or another site that stocks DVDs. You will be able to find DVDs containing seasons of recent, popular cancelled shows including Hannah Montana or Wizards of Waverly Place.

This option is best for those who want to own a physical copy of their shows.
 ITunes has a wider variety of cancelled Disney shows for sale. Type in the title of the show in the search bar. Scroll down until you see the list of TV episodes. There, you can click “see all” to see what’s available. Try adding a season number to your search to refine your results.

This option is for those who wish to buy from a safe, legitimate source but don’t mind it being digital.
 ITunes allows you to select individual episodes to buy. These episodes currently cost $.99 and can be previewed by clicking the video image. You can also buy full seasons of shows for the combined price of the episodes or a little less.

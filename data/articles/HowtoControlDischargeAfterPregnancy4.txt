 Oxytocin is a hormone that helps your uterus contract. When your uterus contracts, your blood vessels will close up and keep your discharge at a normal level. If you have low levels of oxytocin, your doctor may prescribe supplements for you to take to help keep you healthy., If you develop a vaginal infection after you give birth, doctor will most commonly prescribe an antibiotic called metronidazole. The common dosage is 200 mg taken three times a day for five to seven days.You should also talk to your doctor about discontinuing other antibiotics and over-the-counter medications. This is because these medications can interfere with the normal microbes found in your body. When the balance of microbes in your body is changed, you risk the chance of developing an infection.
 Hypovolemic shock occurs when you lose a massive amount of blood (about one-fifth of your total blood). If you experience this, or your partner is experiencing this, you should get to the hospital immediately. Symptoms of hypovolemic shock include:


The menstrual pad saturated in 15 minutes.
Fainting or lightheadedness.
Anxiety.
Skin turns to ashen or grayish.
Skin is cool and clammy.
The pulse has Increased rapidly.
Rapid breathing.
 A postpartum hemorrhage occurs when tissue is left behind in your uterus after you have delivered your child. This can cause heavy bleeding starting in the first 24 hours to 3 weeks after delivery.If you have this, you will most likely have a surgical procedure done that is call dilatation and curettage. During this procedure, the extra tissue will be removed.
 If every other option to contract your uterus has failed and you are losing too much blood, a hysterectomy may be considered. During this procedure, your uterus will be removed to stop the bleeding. This is only considered as the very last option.

 From the File menu, select New>Playlist or type Command-N (Mac) or Control-N (PC).
 Then drag the songs you want to add to your CD to the playlist area.
 From the Sort menu at the top of the playlist's songs, choose the type of sort you want to perform. You can choose an automatic sort order, or you can arrange the songs manually.





When you're finished populating and sorting your playlist, click the blue Done button shown in the top right of the Playlist window.
 Click on the gear icon at the bottom left of the playlist, and select Burn Playlist to Disc.





Alternately, you can select Burn Playlist to Disc from the File menu.
 In the resulting window, set your burn speed and disc format.





Preferred speed: by default, iTunes will use the fastest speed the burner can handle. If you have problems with the burn, try selecting a slower speed here.
Disc format: Burn an audio CD, MP3 CD, DVD, or data CD.
Gap between songs: sets an audio gap between each song of the duration you select.
Use Sound Check. This analyzes all the tracks you've selected, and adjusts the volume of each track so that they all are of the same apparent volume. This is especially handy if you're burning a disc for your car.
Include CD Text: Enable this if your CD player can display track information.
 The playlist will be burned onto the CD. When you're notified of completion, remove your CD and enjoy!

 In the contemporary society we are living in, everyone looks up to you as a good deal when you have done something that is conventionally good. Offering discounts or donating to a specific club or organization will highly affect your promotion. For example, offering discounts for students allows you to receive excellent links from many websites as they usually work in different sectors.
 If you donâ€™t have money to offer discounts or to donate to charity, you can always offer guest posts to other websites, asking them to link your website in return. Writing guest posts for sites that have huge traffic will also increase your traffic, thus increasing your Google rank.
 Instead of guest posts, you can also offer services that can promote the traffic of your website. Alternatively, you could have a staff team-building day on which you help a local charity. This will increase the tag value of the site and will also help improving your Google ranking.

 For example, your husband might want to talk about the day you brought your dog home from the animal shelter. Your kids, on the other hand, might wish to share their story about the time your dog destroyed their favorite toys. Whatever the memories, allow everyone time to share, remember, and celebrate your dog’s life.
 Music can be a welcome addition to your dog’s funeral service. You can create an individualized playlist that speaks to your dog’s life. You can also ask friends and family to play instruments and sing as part of the service.
 Putting photos of your dog on display is a great way to remember your dog. Go through all of your old photos and choose several favorites from multiple stages of your dog’s life. You can then put them in frames or hang them up at the funeral space.
 A poetry reading is a wonderful way to memorialize your dog’s life. You can ask friends and family to write poems about your dog and its life. You can also have guests read their favorite pieces of poetry as a way to reflect on and celebrate your dog’s life.
 A great way to celebrate your dog’s life is to hold a slideshow at the funeral service. Ask friends and family to contribute their favorite photos of your dog. During the funeral service, you can play the slideshow as a tribute to your dog. If you wish, you can also set the slideshow to music that reflects and celebrates your dog’s life.
 Once the music has played, the eulogy has been read, and the guests have been given time to view your dog, it will be time to say goodbye. Allow each guest a chance to say goodbye to your dog before the remains are buried. You can have a traditional procession past the viewing area, or allow guests that wish to say goodbye a chance to do so individually.

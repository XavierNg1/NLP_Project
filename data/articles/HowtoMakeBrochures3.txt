 Though advertising your company, rather than a specific product, requires a less targeted demographic, you should still write your brochure with someone in mind. Some companies have a natural target audience. For example, a piano moving company should write for musicians or companies with pianos that are moving. However, an Italian restaurant will be writing for a more general audience.
 You want to entice someone who picked up your brochure to open it and read further. The headline should be general enough to pique his or her interest, while also saying something about what your company or organization does. A simple statement or rhetorical question work well.For example, a bank might write “Who’s keeping an eye on your money?”
Or, a music store might write “Come tap your foot with us.”

, The point of making a brochure for your company or organization is to tell people who you are and how to get in touch with you. These details need to be featured and easy-to-find. Give the name of your company, when it was founded, what it specializes in, who your clients are (if not the general public), hours of operation, street address, phone number, website, email, and any social media links.
 Your reader will not likely want to spend more than a minute or two looking at your brochure. Put your most important information up front, and limit how much else you include. This will also help keep you from confusing your reader with industry jargon or specialized information.

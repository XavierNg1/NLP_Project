 If you are thinking of bringing a private cause of action for wrongful death, then you need the help of a lawyer. This is a complicated area of law, with high stakes.Only a qualified attorney will know if you can bring a wrongful death lawsuit and what evidence will be most helpful.


To find a qualified attorney, contact your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program.
You might be worried about whether you can afford a lawyer. However, you should realize that many lawyers will take a wrongful death case on “contingency.” Under this arrangement, the lawyer declines to charge a fee but will instead take a percentage of any money you win at trial or through settlement (typically between 25-50%).With a contingency fee agreement, you typically are still responsible for court costs, such as filing fees and fees associated with court reporters. You also have to pay for experts, who can be expensive., You will need to know the actual cause of death. This will help your lawyer decide who you should sue. You cannot win a wrongful death case if you try to sue someone who was not the cause of your loved one’s death.
 If the victim was killed during a car accident or was murdered, then there may be police reports created about the incident. You will need to request them, so that you can get the names of relevant witnesses.
 You can help your lawyer calculate the amount of damages you might be owed by gathering proof of the victim’s wages and benefits. You may recover for wages lost due to the death. You should get the following:


copies of tax returns
copies of the deceased’s W-2 or 1099 forms for the past several years
description of any benefit provided by the deceased’s employer, such as profit-sharing, 401(k) contributions, and medical benefits

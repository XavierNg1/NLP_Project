 If you're having trouble finding the square footage, then it's probably because you're not working with a neat area with just one length and one width. The space might have squares jutting off in different places and could be shaped erratically. All you have to do is split up the space into even squares or rectangles. To find the square footage, or the area, of the entire space, you'll need to find the square footage of the individual spaces and then add them all together.









Draw faint lines separating the different sections.
Label them A, B, and C for your convenience.;
, Using a ruler or measuring tape, find the length and width of the first space you've created, Space A.









The length of the space is 12 feet (3.7 m), and the width is 15 feet (4.6 m).
 To find the square footage -- or the area -- of the space, just multiply the length times the width, just as you would do with any rectangle.









Ex: 12 feet (3.7 m). x 15 feet (4.6 m). = 180 square feet

, Let's say that the length of Space B is 20 feet (6.1 m) and the width of Space B is 10 feet (3.0 m).
 This will lead you to find the square footage of the second space. Here's how you find the square footage of Space B:









Ex: 20 feet (6.1 m). x 10 feet (3.0 m). = 200 square feet.
 Let's say that the length of Space C is 20 feet (6.1 m) and the width of Space C is 35 feet (10.7 m).
 This will lead you to find the square footage of the third space. Here's how you find the square footage of Space C:









Ex: 20 feet (6.1 m). x 35 feet (10.7 m). = 700 square feet

, Once you find the sum of the square footages of the three spaces, you'll know the square footage of the entire space. Here's how you do it:









Square footage of Space A + square footage of Space B + square footage of Space C = square footage of the entire space
180 + 200 + 700 = 1080 square feet

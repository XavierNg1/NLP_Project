 Decide which letters in the regular alphabet will be swapped out for new letters in your alphabet. This is a great way to create a new language, because you can use letters that you and your friends already know. Some letters can remain the same if you'd like, or you can change every letter.


For example, you can substitute each letter with the letter directly after it (A=C, B=D, C=E, D=F). This would be much easier to understanding in writing, because you could decode it. Speaking this language may be more difficult.
You could also substitute every letter except for the vowels. For example, H=J because I(the letter in between) is a vowel. This will make it much easier if you want to be able to speak this language.;
, Swap them so that A is E, E is I, I is O, O is U and U is A. This will allow each word in your language to have a vowel, making the language much easier to understand and pronounce when speaking. The language is simple enough for you and your friends to easily learn, but difficult enough for an unfamiliar listener or reader to not understand what you'r saying.


For example, "I love you" would become "O luvi yua."
Another example would be "Hello, how are you?" turning into "Hillu, huw eri yua?"

, Write words over and over again, practice having conversations with your friends, write notes back and for the to each other in a notebook, or send each other messages online. The more you write and speak your language, the faster it will become second nature to you.
 You’ll either want to create a simple substitution rule that can be memorized and easily decoded by those who know the secret language, or make a cheat sheet / rule sheet if you’d like a code that’s tougher to break. If you decide to go with a tougher code, make sure that all of your friends get a copy of your language code so that they can communicate with you.

, Anything from a plastic slip-cover to a garbage can bag can work well. Make sure it's loose and flexible.
 Make it as even as possible so you don't end up with a lop-sided parachute.









You can use a large bowl or dish to trace your circle. Or if you're really confident, you can even draw a circle freehand!

, Twine or any moderately heavy string should work. Try to scale it to about the same length as the diameter of your parachute.
 A sharp pair of scissors can help a lot here, otherwise you may stretch and/or tear the plastic. Tearing however is not suggested for it can be very messy.









Try taking open scissors and dragging one blade pressing firmly along the circle. Often this leads to a perfect or near perfect cut.
,, A minimum of four holes should be enough. Be careful not to rip the holesâ€”you will be using them to tie your string to the plastic.
, Again, be careful not to tear the holes while knotting, if you are using soft plastic. Avoid getting the string tangled, as well.
 You'll want something moderately heavy. Any object that weighs about 5-10 grams will work.
 You will want to have some height to enjoy the parachute, but be reasonable. After all, you'll need to go back and get it.
 Don't be alarmed if it doesn't open when you drop it at ground level. Even parachutes need time to get air beneath them.

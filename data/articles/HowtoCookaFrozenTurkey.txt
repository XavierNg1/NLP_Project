 If you can find a turkey made to be cooked from frozen that is fine. If not, choose a turkey that has been processed. You are not going to be able to brine this turkey or to do much in the way of adding flavor, so look on the label for one that has been "enhanced," "basted" or described as "self-basting."






;
, This is the big advantage. There will be no need to thaw this turkey for days in advance.
 For timing estimates, start with the number of hours and minutes that a thawed turkey of the same size would take to cook, then add an extra fifty percent. For example, if a thawed turkey would take around four hours, cooking the same turkey from the frozen state would take around six hours. But, always determine whether the turkey is safely cooked by using a thermometer, not a clock. The turkey is done when the thermometer says it is done.
,,, See if the giblets and neck that were most likely packaged, in paper of plastic, in the neck and body cavity are loose enough to remove.
 Do not let a plastic bag containing the giblets melt. If a plastic packet deforms or melts, chemicals may leech into the giblets and the surrounding turkey meat. Neither the giblets nor the turkey should be eaten in that case. A paper giblet bag is safe. After taking the giblets from the turkey, put some onions, celery, citrus or whatever you like to flavor your bird in the cavity.
 The turkey is done when the deepest part of the thigh registers 170 °F (77 °C). and the breast registers 160 °F (71 °C). Because you cooked the turkey from the frozen state, the larger mass of breast meat will thaw and cook more slowly. At the same time, the lesser mass of thigh and leg meat will thaw and cook more quickly. This roasting dynamic allows the breast to register only 160 °F (71 °C), maintaining its moisture, while the deepest part of the thigh reaches a temperature of 170 °F (77 °C).

 Conditioner restores hair health with beneficial oils. If you have naturally greasy hair, however, the extra weight of these oils can make your hair limp. Minimize this effect with this approach:


Use a small dollop of conditioner.
Apply conditioner only to to the tips of your hair, not at the roots.
Rinse it out thoroughly.;
, These approaches are not one-size-fits all, so it may takes some experiment. The results can be well worth it if you have naturally oily hair. Here are a few options:


Switch to a volumizing or lightweight conditioner, or a light oil such as jojoba.
If you have healthy hair with no breakage problems, try skipping conditioner completely, or at least every second or third wash.
If you have fine, oily hair, try using conditioner first, then removing it by applying a small amount of shampoo. This strips away most of the heavy conditioner, without entirely removing the benefit.This may work best with a deep conditioner or a special "pre-shampoo" product., The effect is most noticeable on fine hair, although it's unlikely to solve the problem on its own. Leave the shampoo in a few minutes before rinsing.
 Some people find they get more volume from a dry, leave-in shampoo. Instead of shampooing while you wash, just apply corn starch to your hair and tousle it in thoroughly.


Mix the corn starch with cocoa powder first if you have dark hair.

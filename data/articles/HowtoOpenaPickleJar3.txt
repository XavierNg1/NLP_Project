 Find a roll of duct tape and pull out a long section. The section should be long enough to wrap halfway around the lid with about seven inches of extra tape. When in doubt, itâ€™s better to measure out too much than too little.


You can buy duct tape at most grocery stores and hardware supply stores.
 Wrap the sticky side of the duct tape around the sides and top of the lid in a counter-clockwise direction. Wrap the duct tape halfway around the lid, letting the extra duct tape hang free. Press the sticky parts of the extra duct tape together to create an easy-to-grab duct tape handle.If your jar has a lot of condensation on it, wipe the jar dry before applying the duct tape.
 Grip the jar firmly in your non-dominant hand. Use your dominant hand to pull on the handle. The force of your pull should twist the jar lid in a counter-clockwise direction. Keep pulling until the lid pops off.


If the lid is especially stubborn, have a friend hold the jar while you pull the handle with both hands.
If the jar is slick, use a dishtowel to help you hold it steady.

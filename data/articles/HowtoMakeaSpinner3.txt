Allow for the shaft tip to extend 1/4" inch or 5mm from the point.
Round the tip with a file.
 Here you will use to tie a loop with a string to another loop extending to the bottom tip and coil around the body.

Tightly wind up the 1 1/2 yard (1.25 meters) of a polyester thread coiling the string/rope up around to the top of the trompo.
 Practice throwing and pulling to rapidly spin and release the spinner top.

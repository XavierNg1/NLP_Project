 Being a bridesmaid is expensive and time consuming. No one would expect you to be in two bridal parties at the same time. . You could explain it like this, "I am so sad I can't be in your wedding! Six months ago I committed to being Tracy's maid of honor. I am already swamped planning for that wedding. I would love to be in both wedding parties, but I think I would let both of you down."Your friend’s wedding will take place on the same day as another wedding. You’ve already RSVP'd to attend another wedding – on the same day. Note: if you are using this excuse, you probably won't even be able to attend your friend's wedding.
 Hopefully, she will not expect you to forfeit the money you’ve already spent on nonrefundable plane tickets or nonrefundable hotel or Airbnb deposits. If she does expect that, do you really want to be in her wedding?

, You can say, "Julie, you know how much I love you and that I would be in your wedding if I could. Unfortunately, my hands are tied. If I don't attend this conference, I could lose my job." If an out-of-state conference for work really does fall on or near the date of the wedding in question, consider yourself lucky!

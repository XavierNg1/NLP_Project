 You'll need around 1 yard (0.9Â m) of fabric for this bag, folded and cut as follows:


Fold the fabric for your bag in half.
Decide the length you want the bag to have. Cut the fabric to this length, making two folded pieces of exactly the same length. Put the two bag pieces to one side.
Cut strips. Using the remaining material, unfold it and cut four strips out of equal length and width, to form the straps. The length of the straps is up to you, just remember that the length will be halved when worn over your shoulder.;
, Fold the other bag piece with the wrong sides facing together.


Sew the right and left sides of the two bag fabric pieces together. Do not sew the bag's opening.
 From all the way around the rim, fold the fabric over 1 inch/2.5cm, so that the fold it on the outside. Then sew at the very bottom of the fold. Turn the bag right side out.
 For a standard sized bag, this should be around 2 inches/5cm tall; adjust height as needed.


Wrap this cut piece all the way around the top part of the bag.
Pin it in place.
Sew along the very top of the piece, including the bag in your stitches. Then sew the bottom of the piece in the same way.
 Place the strap pieces with the wrong sides facing together; sew the left and right sides together. Then turn the bag inside out and sew one side of the strap to the left end of half of the bag and sew the other side to the right end of the bag. Repeat on the other half of the bag.


When you sew the straps on, place them a little lower, so that on each base of the strap, you're sewing the bottom of it and the top, which is where the bag stops meeting the strap.
 This very simple carry bag is now complete.

 The layout of your flyer can be simplified by using a template that is already in place at your agency or the printer you will use.;
, You will need to know the size and style of your paper in order to create a real estate flyer that fits.


Use standard 8.5 x 11 inch paper or 11 x 17 inches, or make a smaller flyer with a 5.5 x 8.5 paper size.
Select paper that is at least 60# gloss. This is similar to the cover of a magazine in how it looks and feels. You can use 80# or even 100# if you want a flyer that is glossier or heavier, but those paper types are more expensive.
 It should share 1 or 2 special details and grab a potential buyer's attention. For example, a headline could read "3 Bedroom Town house with Updated Kitchen in Gated Community."

, This attracts a reader or potential buyer before the text does. Showing instead of telling is more attention grabbing.


Include photos of the inside and outside of the house, as well as pictures of any special details such as a formal dining room, hot tub or updated master bath. Pay attention to staging. For example, place a vase of flowers on the table in a photo, and make sure the pictures show a clean, presentable home.
Make the photos extra appealing by including a nice border around each picture and writing a caption for each one. Potential buyers want to know what they are looking at.
 Instead of long paragraphs, use short descriptive sentences and bullet points.
 Remember that you are selling a dream as well as a home with your real estate flyer.

Help potential buyers imagine themselves living in that house. Instead of saying "swing set included," try "your kids can safely enjoy the outdoors with a backyard playscape."

, Make sure your real estate flyer has the agent's name, phone number, email address and website.



Invite them to an open house or tell them to schedule a showing today. Share a sense of urgency with potential buyers to drive a quick sale.

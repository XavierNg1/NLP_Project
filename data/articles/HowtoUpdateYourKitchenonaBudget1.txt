 Paint is one of the simplest, cheapest ways to update your kitchen. If you have a bold retro color, you will probably need to prime the walls before you can apply a new color. If you are only trying to update faded white or off-white walls—including walls stained with tobacco smoke—primer may not be necessary. You can go with pure white to give your kitchen a fresh, modern feeling, or you can opt for a light blue to add a calm, refreshing dose of tranquility. Beige is also an acceptable color, especially if you have wood cabinets or countertops.


Use satin or semigloss latex paint for your walls. These two types of paint are easier to scrub, which is important in a greasy room like the kitchen.;
, Old kitchens tend to have old, dated tile flooring. A relatively inexpensive way to update the look of your kitchen is by ripping up the tiles and installing linoleum or laminate floors. These floors are durable, easy to clean, and can be installed without professional help. They also present a fresh, clean look.
 Mosaic tiles are chic and fit nicely behind a stove or sink. Small square mirrors are a good way to open a tiny, cramped kitchen up. Framed photographs or prints, hung closely together, are another good way to add visual interest to an otherwise boring kitchen.

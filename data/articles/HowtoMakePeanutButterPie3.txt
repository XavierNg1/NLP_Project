 If you like your peanut butter with a little crunch, adding bits of peanuts over the pie is a good choice. Salted peanuts are especially tasty — having a hint of salt in the recipe is the perfect way to complement its natural sweetness.
 Pouring melted chocolate over the pie and letting it set will give you a layer of solid chocolate over the soft filling. It's almost like making one giant peanut butter cup. See below for directions:


Break good-quality chocolate into small chunks with a mallet or the back of a knife.
Add the chocolate to a double boiler and gradually melt. Alternatively, microwave in 30 second increments, stirring often.
When the chocolate is completely melted, let it cool slightly for a minute or two. Then, spoon it over the filled pie, carefully spreading it with a spatula as needed until even. Cool in the refrigerator as normal.
 A light dusting of confectioner's sugar adds just a touch of sweetness. It's also great for presentation, especially when paired with the dark tones of the chocolate crust above.
 Reese's and other peanut butter cup candies are the perfect topping for peanut butter pie. There are several ways to incorporate them. For instance, you can try roughly chopping them and sprinkling them over the filling for a rustic topping. If you have more time, you can also arrange the pieces in intricate designs — perfect for desserts that you really want to make a strong impression.
 If you have leftover whipped topping from the pie filling, carefully spreading over the pie once it's set to give it another layer of flavor (plus added volume). Spray-can whipped cream also works well.


Try drizzling a little chocolate fudge or caramel over the pie when you're done with the whipped cream — it shows up well against the whiteness of the topping.

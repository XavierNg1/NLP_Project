 Again, this is a paper. You can write the most eloquent, eye-welling, nose-blowing piece since Marley & Me, but if you've forgotten all your commas and transition words, your efforts will be lost.


Give your paper logical order. Each paragraph should flow into the next. If you find yourself asking questions when you go over it, answer them. The reader will be asking them too.
Let it come to a conclusion. This paper is not an episode from a soap opera--it should open and close within the maximum number of words allowed. Don't use the element of suspense as a literary technique.
Make it flow on a micro level as well. That means checking your sentences for clarity and meaning. Is there anything that's a little hard to understand or requires assuming? Could you be more concise in your wording?

, You've been working on this paper so long you can barely wrestle out of this pile of candy wrappers and Starbucks cups. Once you're done, let someone else review it. A second set of eyes will prove very valuable.


Make sure they look for content and grammatical errors. In writing it, you may have become blind to both. After a while, our eyes stop seeing mistakes and gloss over them in our heads. Have a friend or family member read it and bring up any questions they have or notes on grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
 Have you gotten the points across that you wanted? Did you set the right tone? Is there anything you left out? Take the time now to assess if you've met all your goals.


Did you use active verbs? Too many passive sentences and your paper will lose its oomph. Did you spellcheck with your brain and not your computer? Eye mean, watch this. And the oldie but a goodie: Did you write your name on it?

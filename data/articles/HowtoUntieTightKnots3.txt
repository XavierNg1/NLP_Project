 If you’re working on untying a tight knot in a rope, cord, or other fiber-based material, soaking it in water can help the process along. Just fill your sink or a small pot with water and let the knot sit in it for 10 minutes or so. After the time has elapsed, try to untie it. If it remains tight, place it back in the water for another 10 minutes, then check again., For knots in a medium-gauge cord or rope, bite the knot between your teeth. Work your jaw from side to side a bit. The pressure from your clenched teeth should loosen the knot enough that you can untie it with ease. You might even be able to feel it expanding between your teeth., If the tight knot you’re interested in untying is in your shoelaces, go for a walk or run. The combination of forward motion and stomping on the ground will naturally loosen the shoelace knot over time.The amount of time you will need to spend walking or running before your tight knot is loosened sufficiently varies depending on the severity of the knot. Very tight knots will take longer to loosen than knots that are merely tight.
Start by walking about for 10 minutes or so, then testing the knot in your shoelace. If it is still tight, walk a bit more.

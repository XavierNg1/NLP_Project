 Before choosing a place to eat with your pals, you should first discuss any dietary restrictions they might have. For example, if one of your friends has a gluten intolerance, you will want to choose a place with gluten-free options like a Thai restaurant or sushi bar.Ask everyone in the party whether they have allergies, food sensitivities, or other restrictions.
Always respect your friends’ dietary restrictions, even if you don’t understand them.;
, When planning a meal with others, it is important to think about how long everyone has to enjoy the meal. For example, if your friend has to be at work after the meal, you will want to choose a restaurant with fast, reliable service instead of one that is known for being slow., Chances are your friends live in multiple neighborhoods, which means that you should consider the location of a restaurant you choose. Think about how long it might take each member of your party to reach the restaurant. You should also consider whether or not everyone has reliable transportation to get to a suggested dining location.
 It is important that you think about your friends’ budgets when choosing a place to eat. Not everyone has the same financial resources, so it is important to pick a place that everyone can afford. For example, your friend who is a successful engineer might be able to afford the hip new four-star restaurant, but this restaurant might be unaffordable for the friend who teaches high school.

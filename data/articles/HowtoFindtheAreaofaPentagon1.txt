 This method works for regular pentagons, with five equal sides. Besides the side length, you'll need the "apothem" of the pentagon. The apothem is the line from the center of the pentagon to a side, intersecting the side at a 90º right angle.


Don't confuse the apothem with the radius, which touches a corner (vertex) instead of a midpoint. If you only know the side length and radius, skip down to the next method instead.
We'll use an example pentagon with side length 3 units and apothem 2 units.;
, Draw five lines from the center of the pentagon, leading to each vertex (corner). You now have five triangles.
 Each triangle has a base equal to the side of the pentagon. It also has a height equal to the pentagon's apothem. (Remember, the height of a triangle runs from a vertex to the opposite side, at a right angle.) To find the area of any triangle, just calculate ½ x base x height.


In our example, area of triangle = ½ x 3 x 2 = 3 square units.
 We've divided the pentagon into five equal triangles. To find the total area, just multiply the area of one triangle by five.


In our example, A(total pentagon) = 5 x A(triangle) = 5 x 3 = 15 square units.

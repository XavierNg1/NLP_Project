 Attach the yarn to your crochet hook, then work a foundation row of chain stitches that roughly matches your desired scarf length.


For an adult's scarf, work a foundation of 170 chain stitches. For a child's scarf, work a foundation of 80 to 90 chain stitches.
Use a slipknot to attach the yarn to your crochet hook.
For further instruction on making slip knots and chain stitches, please see the "Tips" section of this article.
 Single crochet once into the second chain from your hook, then single crochet once in each chain after that.


Continue along in this manner until you reach the end of the row.
See the “Tips” section if you need help with the single crochet stitch.
At the end of the row, chain three. This chain is referred to as a "turning chain," and it allows you to set the height of the next row.
Turn the work over before moving onto the next row.
 Double crochet into the stitch at the base of the turning chain. Then, double crochet once into the next stitch and twice into the stitch after that.


For the remainder of the row, follow this pattern:

Double crochet once into the next stitch.
Double crochet twice into the stitch after that.


See the “Tips” section if you need further instruction on the double crochet stitch.
Once you reach the end of the row, chain four to complete another turning chain. Turn the work over before continuing.
 Triple crochet once into the stitch at the base of the turning chain. Then, triple crochet once into the next stitch and twice into the stitch after that.


Repeat the same pattern across the entire row:

Triple crochet once in the next stitch.
Triple crochet twice into the stitch after that.


For further instruction on the triple crochet stitch, please see the "Tips" section of this article.
At the end of the row, work a turning chain of five chain stitches. Turn the work over before continuing to the next row.
 Double treble crochet into the stitch at the base of the turning chain. After that, double treble crochet once into the next stitch and twice into the stitch after that.


For the remainder of the row, follow the same pattern:

Double treble crochet once into the next stitch.
Double treble crochet twice into the stitch after that.


Please see the "Tips" section for additional instruction on the double treble crochet.
Chain one when you reach the end of the row and turn before continuing.
 Single crochet once into the stitch at the base of your turning chain. Single crochet twice into each stitch until you reach the end of the row.


This is the final row, so there is no need to work a turning chain or to turn the work.
 Cut the yarn, leaving a tail measuring at least 4 inches (10 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the work.


Weave this tail and the tail at the start of your work into the stitches along the end of the scarf.
The completion of this step completes the overall project.

 This is obvious because you need to beat a stage to get to the next one. Start out at the easiest possible stage, and gradually work your way up as new concepts are introduced to you and you become more confident with the older ones.;
, Maybe after a few tries you just got lucky. Find out what you did wrong, and practice it multiple times to perfect that skill. You will thank yourself later on in the game.
 Being precise lessens the amount of times you fall off the stage, and being fast ensures you can finish the level within the time limit. Combine the two and you get a master, someone who can finish any level on their first try to well within the time limit.


You can improve your precision by finding a level that is like an obstacle course, like square holes on the ground you will fall through if you go over or pins you can't hit. Don't move the control stick all the way up to go fast, just keep it slightly tilted in the direction you want to go and gradually tilt is to change directions to get around the next obstacle.
You can improve your speed by first becoming really comfortable with going slowly and precisely and then picking up the pace a little.

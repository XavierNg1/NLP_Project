 Squirt a dollop of glue in the middle of a craft stick. Then, place another stick on top of the glue, keeping it perpendicular with the first stick to make a cross. Repeat this process to make the second cross. Finally, glue the two crosses together, placing one stick cross at a 45-degree angle on top of the other cross.Give the snowflake a few minutes to dry.
You can find craft sticks and glue at your local crafts store.
 Once the craft sticks have securely attached to each other, cover the entire snowflake in glue. Then pour some fake snow into a paper plate and place the glue-covered snowflake in it. Once one side is covered in fake snow, flip it over and cover the other side.You should be able to find fake snow at your local craft store. If not, you can shred some white tissue paper or paint the snowflake white.
 After the glue has dried, wrap one end of a white pipe cleaner around the top of one of the sticks. Then create a loop and wrap the remaining cleaner around the stick. Tie a piece of string or thread to the loop and hang it wherever you would like.

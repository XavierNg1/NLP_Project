 To do this, open the Minecraft launcher, and select “New Profile” in the bottom-left corner to open the Profile Editor menu.


In the Profile Name box at the top, enter “snapshot,” and in the Version Selection section, check the first box labeled “Enable experimental development versions (‘snapshots’).”
In the Use Version drop-down menu, select “Snapshot 14w28b,” and then click “Save profile” in the bottom-right corner.
 Just left-click the drop-down menu in the bottom-left corner of the launcher, and select the snapshot.
, This should include coordinates for your character's current location as well as coordinates for the block they are looking at.




<x1> <y1> <z1> This is the starting block that you wish to clone.

<x2> <y2> <z2> This is the ending block in an area that you want to clone. The area connects the first coordinate and the second coordinate in a 3D block .

<x> <y> <z> This is the place where the cloned land will appear.
, Type it in to fill in each set of coordinates based on the ones you determined earlier.


Do not include the angle brackets in your command, and make sure that they are separated by a space.



The remaining blocks will fill in from that position filling the area specified.
The maximum number of blocks that can be copied is 32768, and it will return an error if you exceed it.
There is currently no ability to rotate a cloned segment; the orientation will remain the same.
 This specifies what blocks are cloned.



Replace. If you do not specify a mode1, this is the default. This mode copies every block in the selected area.

Filtered. Removes everything but the type of block specified. For example, “/clone 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 1 filtered normal minecraft:stone” will only clone stone from the area.

Masked. Copies every block except air.
 Use this to change how the clone interacts with the world.



Normal. This is the default setting for mode2. It puts the clone in the specified area, but it will display an error message if there is any overlapping.

Move. The blocks that are cloned are replaced with air, causing the area to appear as if it was moved.

Force. If the area where the new clone appears will cause blocks to overlap, this mode will force the blocks overlapping to be replaced.
 Now that you know what mode1 and mode2 does, choose which mode you will add to your clone command.
 Once you’ve chosen a mode, insert it after the coordinates you typed in the chat box.


For example: “/clone <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2> <x> <y> <z> mode1 mode2”.
Modes are an optional part of cloning that give the user more control over what is cloned. If a mode is not specified, the default modes are “Replace” for mode1 and “Normal” for mode2.
If one mode 1 is specified and mode 2 is not, it will default to Normal and vice versa.
 The area will then appear at the <x> <y> <z> coordinate and with the modes you added.

 Blue eyes can match well with a variety of shades, but classic neutral shades go great with blue during the day.Neutrals include colors like navy, olive, gold, silver, cream, and camel.Neutrals tend to go with anything. If you don't want a look that's completely lacking in color, you can use neutrals to bring out your eyes while still having some bright colors in your outfit. For example, if you want to wear a pink top, wear it with olive green jeans.;
, Corals tend to bring out green eyes during the day. Corals contrast with green just slightly to make your eyes really pop. Look for coral wardrobe items to highlight green eyes during the day.For example, look for coral dresses, undershirts, blazers, or pants to bring out your green eyes during the day.
 While hazel eyes do tend to pair well with darker colors, during the day you should go lighter. Lavender can really bring out your hazel eyes for daytime wear.If lavender is too soft or feminine for your tastes, you can incorporate it in small ways. For example, wear a lavender undershirt with a suit.

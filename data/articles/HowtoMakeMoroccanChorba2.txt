 Wash a small onion, one stalk of celery, and rinse fresh flat-leaf parsley. Carefully use a sharp knife to finely chop 1/4 cup (40 g) of onion, 1/4 cup (55 g) of celery, and 2 tablespoons of the parsley. Set the vegetables aside., Pour 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a large saucepan. Heat the oil over medium-high. Sprinkle salt and freshly ground black pepper over 1 pound (453 g) of trimmed, diced boneless lamb shoulder. Add the lamb to the saucepan and cook it until it's browned all over.Stir the lamb as it browns to keep it from sticking from the pan.
 Scoop 1/2 cup (115 g) of the canned tomato puree into the saucepan along with 1/2 cup of water and 3 tablespoons of harissa. Stir the chorba mixture and let it cook for a few minutes.If you can't find harissa, you can use any spicy chili paste.
 Stir the chopped onion, celery and parsley into the saucepan. Stir in the remaining 2 cups (450 g) of canned tomato puree and 3 cups (709 ml) of water.You can easily add other vegetables or leftover broth, depending on what you have in your refrigerator.
 Once the chorba begins to bubble, reduce the heat to low and put the lid on. Let the chorba simmer for about 20 minutes. The lamb will become tender and the vegetables will soften., Use hot pads to take the lid off the saucepan and pour in another 3 cups (709 ml) of water. Turn the heat up to medium-high, so the chorba begins to boil. Gradually pour in Â¾ cup (150 g) of fine pearl barley while you stir the chorba.If you don't have fine pearl barley, you can use millet or orzo.
 Continue to cook the chorba on medium-high for another 10 minutes. This will give the pearl barley a chance to cook. Taste the chorba and adjust the seasonings.You can serve the chorba with sliced lemon.

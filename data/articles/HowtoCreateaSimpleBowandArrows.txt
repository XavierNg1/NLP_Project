 It should go above your head when you hold it straight out in front of you (like you were about to shoot) You can choose to make it smaller if you wish, but this size gets the most power.;
, Whittle it down so that both ends should be roughly the same size, but the center of the bow should be thicker than the ends. If you wish, you may take some fabric and wrap it around the center for a handle. At both ends carve half-moon shaped notches for the string to go.
 be stretchy , the power comes from the bow, not the string. make sure it is tight enough to make the bow bend slightly. When you pull back on the string even very slightly, it should vibrate when you let go. (Never dry fire; pulling the bow string back to full length and letting go without a loaded arrow, it will weaken the bow over time)

, it should be about 3 inches (7.6Â cm) longer than the length of your arm. cut off any growths growing off the sides of the arrow. Strip it of it's bark. Take your knife and carve a notch in one end of the arrow (for the string) and make sure it is large enough to let the string pass through.
 If you would like you can fashion an arrowhead out of a piece of flint, rock, bone, or glass and tie it to the tip.
, With the two fingers of your dominant hand, place your index finger above the arrow, and your middle finger below and pull back, holding the middle of the bow in your non-dominant hand. Release and let your arrow fly!

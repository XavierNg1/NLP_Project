You will see each transfer though other computers on a network, or HOPs the IP packet takes along the path to the site/server. On each line there will be three durations (in milliseconds) to each hop along with the domain name of that device and its IP address.
The more HOPs there are, the more routers the packet traveled through. You will see something like:
28 ms 41 ms 33 ms www.firstdevicedomain.com 2 48 ms 41 ms 49 ms www.seconddevicedomain.com ]
3 92 ms 99 ms 98 ms www.thirddevicedomain.com 4 122 ms 141 ms 137 ms www.domain.com Typically, a router configuration problem or bad IP address will read something like this on the first HOP line: "157.54.48.1 reports: Destination net unreachable."

 When it comes to your hair, keep it fairly simple. You’ll be getting wet so don’t spend a lot of time styling your hair.


An easy styling tip for your hair is the night before the party wash your hair. Then, while it's still damp, spritz on a bit of detangler and put it into a single braid (you can try multiple braids, too). In the morning, undo the braid(s) and you'll have beachy waves, which are perfect for a pool party!
You may also want to keep your hair in a loose braid at the party. This is particularly useful if your hair is already wet after being in the pool. You can quickly braid it and once it has dried, can let it loose as the night wears on.
 Everyone can benefit from adding a few accessories to their pool style. Try a stylish hat, which will not only provide extra protection from the sun, but will look cute as well. A few pieces of jewelry is acceptable, but don’t overdo it, as you still want to be able to enjoy the pool without being weighed down.


Don’t wear any jewelry that is overly expensive, as you’re at risk of losing it while in the pool.
Floppy hats are not only stylish, but practical for keeping the sun off your face.
Sunscreen is an important accessory. Consider bringing a matching bag to hold your sunscreen and other accessories when you’re in the pool.
 Although sunglasses are an accessory, they are such a major part of your pool party style, that they deserve to be in their own category. Sunglasses provide protection, while making a statement.


Try to match your sunglasses with what you’re wearing. For example, if you’re wearing gold jewelry, try finding some gold rimmed sunglasses to wear as well.
Pair sunglasses with a hat for added protection and a stylish look.

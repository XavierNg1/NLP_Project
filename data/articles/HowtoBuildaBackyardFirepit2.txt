 Choose a place that will provide room to walk around the fire, away from plants, fences, or any other kinds of flammable material. Consider the wind in your backyard and the way it will blow smoke from the fire. Also consider how many people will be enjoying the fire, a 6-foot buffer minimum is a good idea.
, Leave about 2 inches (5.1Â cm) between the bricks for air circulation.
 Cover most of the bottom of the pit, creating a small "dip" in the center where you can place newspaper and kindling. Sprinkle water on the concrete until it hardens to your satisfaction.
 Construct a tepee from kindling around the newspaper. Light the newspaper, and you're ready to go.
 When the kindling gets going, start placing bigger pieces of wood around the shelf in a tepee shape.

 After you have sufficiently assessed the issue, take a break from social media to clear your mind and begin breaking your bad habit. Deactivate your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and any other social media that you might have. This is a good way to give yourself space from your addiction without having to necessarily delete your accounts.During this time, develop a timeline for when and if you will get your social media back. Find healthy activities to replace your social media addiction.
 In addition to deactivating the accounts, in order to further deter your temptation, delete the apps from your phone. Not being able to see the apps on your homescreen may help you during this time of self reflection and habit-breaking., If you feel that you cannot successfully beat the habit on your own, then hand over the account to someone you trust. Have them change the password so that you cannot access the account even if you want to. Tell them to give you the account after the predetermined period ends.Make sure to only give your password to family or friends that you deeply trust. Giving your password away is highly sensitive and could end disastrously if in the wrong hands.
Consider ceasing social media usage for a minimum of three weeks, as it typically takes 21 days to form a habit.

 The control panel is the interface with most of the buttons that you use to operate your washing machine. Use a screw driver to remove the screws that hold it in place., There should be a plastic tube underneath the control panel. It should be firmly plugged in. Remove this water level control valve and blow into it. The air should flow through naturally. If you can't exhale naturally there is a clog that needs to be fixed.If the tube is unplugged, then the washer might begin to work again if you properly reinsert it into the pressure switch.
 If the tube seems to be clogged, fill a turkey baster with vinegar and pump the vinegar down the tube. The vinegar will dissolve the soapy residue and should return the washing machine to normal., The plastic tube should connect to the pressure switch, which measures the amount of water in the washing machine. The pressure switch should be a circular piece that looks a bit like a gear, connected to a tube. It is generally directly underneath the control panel. Disconnect the wires and plug a multimeter in to check for continuity.There are three separate plugs, which also means that there are three pairs of connections to test with the multimeter. Test each of these pairs separately. There should be connectivity between all of the pairs.
If the washing machine isnâ€™t filling up or is filling up with too much water, that is a good sign that there is an issue with the pressure switch or water level control valve.
 Each make and model will have its own unique method for replacing the pressure switch. If your test establishes that the pressure switch is the issue, check the instruction manual for directions on how to replace it.

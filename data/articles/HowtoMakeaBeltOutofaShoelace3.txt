 You may want to use the same colored elastic band as the shoelace; if you use a contrasting colour against the shoelace color, then it may look odd, but that's up to your sense of style.
 Twist one shoelace around the other until you get to the end. When you reach the end, tie off with another elastic band.
 Studs and diamonds add a nice effect.
 Thread until your heart's content with various thread designs.
 Stitch or glue in place.
 To wear, thread the belt through the belt holders of your pants, jeans or skirt, and tie in a knot or bow.

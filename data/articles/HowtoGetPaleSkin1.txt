 People who live closer to the equator are exposed to more ultra-violet (UV) radiation, so their cells produce more melanin. This excess melanin leads to a darker skin pigmentation that helps the skin protect itself from UV damage. Keeping out of the sun will keep skin from producing extra melanin, which may help the pigment return to a paler state. If your skin is naturally dark, however, staying out of the sun won't do much.


Keep out of the sun as much as possible, especially in the late morning and afternoon.If you must be outside while the sun is brightest, try to stick to the shade.
Try carrying an umbrella to protect yourself the sun. A regular black umbrella that’s designed to keep you dry in the rain will also block out at least 90 percent of UV rays.Remember that sunlight and UV rays bounce off concrete, water, sand, snow, and other surfaces. Be aware of your environment!;
, Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against UVA (rays that age your skin) and UVB (rays that burn your skin).Find a sunscreen with an SPF (sun-protection factor) between 30 and 50. Any SPF above 50 is not significantly more effective, so don’t worry about finding the highest number.You are still exposed to UV rays in winter, even though it's cooler. Wear sunscreen every day of the year, especially if you enjoy winter sports at high elevations.
 Most summer-weight clothing (e.g. cotton garments) does not provide a measurable amount of sun protection. Look for clothes with a UPF (ultraviolet protection) rating. Choose clothes with long sleeves, long hems, and high collars. Consider wearing sunglasses, gloves, and wide-brimmed hats.


The sun is necessary for vitamin D production, but most people don’t need more than 20 minutes of uncovered exposure.

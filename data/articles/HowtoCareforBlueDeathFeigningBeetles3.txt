 These are desert beetles, so the humidity should be kept low. In-fact, the color of the beetles is based on the relative humidity! Beetles living in a cage with higher humidity will turn a blackish color, while beetles that are kept in low humidity, are bright blue! A lower humidity means more colorful beetles. If the humidity is too high, the beetles will die. Blue death feigning beetles do alright at room temperature, but a higher temperature will encourage breeding. Overall, they should be kept between 70 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit, (21-30 degrees Celsius) and at a relative humidity of 0-20%.
 Blue death feigning beetles are omnivorous. They will eat just about anything. Lettuce, carrots, apples, celery, and watermelon are the most convenient foods to feed your beetles and provide the beetles with water. Dry dog and cat food, grains, and other dead insects will also be eaten by blue death feigning beetles.

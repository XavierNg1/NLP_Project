 Sometimes, sharing salary information can lead to jealousy in the workplace. A coworker might get jealous of what you make, leading to tension. On the other hand, knowing salaries provides a reference for asking for a raise, so it can go either way.For instance, you can say you've gathered information on salary in your company, and you know you're being underpaid. Even if you don't tell your boss that, you at least know you're being underpaid and have cause to ask for a raise.
 If you tell someone your salary, that information is out there. That means it can be told to everyone in the office. If you're not ready for the whole office to know, then you shouldn't tell your salary., While it's technically illegal for management to take any action against you (including firing you), that doesn't mean they can't make life difficult for you in subtle ways. If management doesn't like what you're doing, they may snub you in ways that you can't prove are connected to the salary discussions.If you can prove that you are being discriminated against, you do have protection under the law. The key is to document everything you can, and take it to a lawyer.

 Get rid of all the candy, chips and baked goods that are lurking around in your cupboards and desk drawers. Think of the calories you just saved!;
, Using an 8 or 9 inch (20.3 or 22.9 cm) plate fill ¼ with meat or protein, ¼ with starch, and ½ with veggies. This keeps your portions under control and the smaller plate makes you feel like you have lots of food.
 Getting 3-5 small balanced meals each day keeps you from getting over hungry and overeating.
 Sauces, dressings, mayo--they can add hundreds of calories each day. Cut back and look for low calorie alternatives like mustard instead of mayo, balsamic vinegar instead of salad dressing, low fat mayo. The same goes for fried foods too; opt for baked and broiled instead.
 Thinking ahead for meals and snacks will keep you from grabbing high calorie goodies when you get hungry. Stock your home and office with low calorie, healthy snacks.
, You’ve been waiting for months for the warm weather, so get out there and enjoy it! Take a walk, ride a bike, get a friend to join. Being active burns calories and can help you lose weight faster. Buy an inexpensive pedometer and add more steps everyday.
 Do you snack at night or overeat when you get stressed? Look for healthier alternatives than eating out of boredom or stress.
 Fluids are important any time of year, but especially as it gets warmer outside. Staying well hydrated can also help keep your appetite in check. Aim for 8-10 glasses of fluid each day.
 Fiber doesn’t add calories, but makes you feel full. Avoid the white breads and pastas and focus on high fiber whole grains, fruits and vegetables to keep calories under control.

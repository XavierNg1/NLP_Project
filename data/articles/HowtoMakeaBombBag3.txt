 An easy way to make an effective bomb bag is to add detergent to the baking soda in the bomb bag, which acts as a retardant for the chemical reaction so that you have time to seal the bag before the baking soda and vinegar react. Begin making the bomb bag by adding ¼ cup (4.78 ml) of baking soda to a sealable sandwich bag., Once you have added the baking soda, add one tablespoon (14.78 ml) of dishwashing detergent into the sandwich bag. Shake the bag slightly to allow the detergent to combine with the baking soda., After adding in the dishwashing detergent, pour in ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of vinegar into the sandwich bag of baking soda and detergent., Once you add the vinegar, immediately zip the seal of the bag. Even though the detergent slows down the chemical reaction, it’s still essential to zip the bag at once so that the pressure can build inside the bag.Not closing the bag in time can cause a significantly smaller explosion or it can cause the fizzing reaction to happen before the closing of the bag, so that even when you close the bag it won’t explode.
 Once you seal the bag, place or toss it down onto a easily cleanable surface. Then watch the pressure build and the bag explode!

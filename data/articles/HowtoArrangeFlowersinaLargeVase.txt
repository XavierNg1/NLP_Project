 Leaves rot in water and will cause the water to smell.


If you are using a flower with thorns on the stems like roses, carefully remove the thorns with either the blade of the scissors or vegetable knife. The thorns can pierce other stems and flowers causing them to wilt.
If any of the bottom flowers are looking wilted or tired, pinch them off with your fingers.;
, Cut off the stems of three monstera leaves.


With the other five leaves, cut the stems to about 30 centimeter (11.8 in).
 Ensure that your vase is clean. Fill with fresh cold water and add a small dash of household bleach to keep it nice and fresh. It may seem unlikely but it really works!

,, Using the scissors cut the stems on an angle, to enable maximum water absorption.


If the flowers you are using have a woody stem like roses, slightly split the stems about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) up the middle.
Cut the flowers to stand double the height of the vase. Measure your flowers against your tape measure, from the end of the stem to the tip of the flower.
 Arrange 20 flowers ensuring they are the same height and an even spread. With the last 10 flowers, cut 10 centimeter (3.9 in) off the bottom and feed them in around the outside of the vase. This will make it look like the flowers are bursting out of the vase.
 Place your vase in the middle of a table.

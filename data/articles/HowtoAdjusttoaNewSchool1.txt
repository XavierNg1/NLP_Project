 Before you start the school, go with your parents to visit the school. Find out where your classroom will be, as well as the cafeteria, auditorium, gym and other important places (including the bathroom!) , Meeting your teachers before you start school will also help you make a smooth adjustment to the new school. Introduce yourself and smile. Being friendly with your teachers will help your transition. Find out some key facts about them, such as what subject they teach, where they teach, their name etc.
 Knowing the school’s policies ahead of time will help make it easier to fit in with the school culture. Get the school handbook from the school or download it from the school’s website. Read through it with your parents so that they can explain policies that might sound confusing to you. If your new school doesn't have a handbook, read the rules and school diary to get used to what is expected.


The school handbook might also have some interesting facts about the school, which can help you get acquainted with its history, the students and the teachers.
 It will be helpful to know when vacation/holiday days are scheduled, as well as half-days and special days like field days or carnivals. Mark these dates on a calendar in your room. This will help you anticipate when you have a short day of school or a day off.

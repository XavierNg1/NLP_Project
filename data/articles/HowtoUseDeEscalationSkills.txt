 If a direct threat or danger of physical harm occurs, call for assistance. Don't place yourself or others in harm's way. Prevention takes much less energy.;
, Your body language will communicate much more than what you say. Placing yourself at an angle rather than head-on is less confrontational than a direct, head-on stance, and protects essential body parts.
 Don't get trapped behind a desk or other furniture. Don't discuss hot topics in isolated areas.Leave the door open. Not only will you be able to access help more readily, an open door can help reduce tension for someone who is angry or paranoid.
 Remember your goal is to solve problems, not engage in a verbal battle. Use reflective statements like, "It sounds like you are really angry about this." Ask the person to offer their solution. Ask, "What can we do to resolve this?" Don't be distracted and keep returning to the immediate topic at hand. Use non-judgmental language.
 More than two people can just make the situation worse.
 If the person is calm enough to continue talking, allow them to continue the problem-solving process. Let the person know what you can do, what might not be in your control, and develop a plan of action with the person. Tell them when and how the plan you develop together will be put into effect and when you'll get back to them.
 Use directive, simple statements like, "Please sit down."

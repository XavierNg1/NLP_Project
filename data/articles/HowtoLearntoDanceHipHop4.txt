 If you and your friends share the same taste in music, this shouldn’t be too hard. Maybe you also know someone who has taken a class in the past who can give you some tips.


You can also ask around, post a facebook or twitter status, or gather friends who you know are up for anything.
You should never be too forceful with your friends. If they are too uncomfortable, no one will have any fun. This might mean that you aren’t dancing with your closest friends, but rather your friends who are the most up for dancing. That’s okay! You can have more than one type of friend.
 If you or one of your friends has previous experience with dancing, this can be very valuable to the group. The best thing about doing things in a group is that you suddenly have the knowledge of multiple people.
 There are multiple ways to dance in a group, so decide on the one that best fits the group that you have.


There plenty of group routines that you can copy just by watching videos. If you want to do something more formal, like a performance, this would be the way to go.
Maybe you just want to dance as a group in a club. In that case, it would be better for you all to learn hip hop moves or solo routines, so that you can switch off. There are plenty of youtube videos for individual moves that you can learn together. , You don’t have to wait until everybody is 100% confident in him or herself. That’s the beauty of working in a group! You always have everyone’s support and the knowledge that everyone you are with wants to dance with you too.

 The base is the large number (or variable) in the exponential expression, and the exponent is the small number.

The exponent tells you how many times to multiply the base by itself (x3=x×x×x{\displaystyle x^{3}=x\times x\times x}).In the case of variables, an exponential expression will also have a coefficient, which is a number appearing before the variable that tells you how to multiply the variable.Even if a variable has no coefficient, it is understood to have the coefficient of 1{\displaystyle 1}. For example, x4=1x4{\displaystyle x^{4}=1x^{4}}


, The terms must have BOTH of these parts in common.

For example, if the problem is x4+3x6+4x4+2y4{\displaystyle x^{4}+3x^{6}+4x^{4}+2y^{4}}, you should note that x4{\displaystyle x^{4}} and 4x4{\displaystyle 4x^{4}} have the same base (x{\displaystyle x}) and the same exponent (4{\displaystyle 4}). Thus, these two terms can be added together. The term 3x6{\displaystyle 3x^{6}} has a different exponent, so it cannot be added; the term 2y4{\displaystyle 2y^{4}} has a different base, so it cannot be added.
 Remember, if a term has no coefficient shown, a coefficient of 1{\displaystyle 1} is understood. Do NOT add the exponents. The exponent stays the same.

For example, if you are calculating x4+4x4{\displaystyle x^{4}+4x^{4}} you would add together the coefficients, and x4{\displaystyle x^{4}} would stay the same:x4+4x4{\displaystyle x^{4}+4x^{4}}=(1)x4+(4)x4{\displaystyle =(1)x^{4}+(4)x^{4}}=5x4{\displaystyle =5x^{4}}


, Remember, you cannot add exponential expressions that do not have the same base AND exponent, so those will stay the same as they were in the original problem.

For example, x4+3x6+4x4+2y4{\displaystyle x^{4}+3x^{6}+4x^{4}+2y^{4}} simplifies to 5x4+3x6+2y4{\displaystyle 5x^{4}+3x^{6}+2y^{4}}.

 If getting to a branch of your bank or enrolling in online banking is too difficult from your current location, you can mail the check and a completed deposit slip to your bank's designated routing location. You'll need to check with your bank to determine where to send the check. Call the toll-free number on your bank card and speak with a representative to figure out where to send the check.


Bank of America, for instance, lists an address in Phoenix, AZ for all members living in AZ, CA, ID, IL, IN, MI, NM, NV, OR, TX, and WA, and an address in Tampa, FL for members in all other states. If you're mailing the check overnight or via FedEx, however, the address changes. You'll need to look online or speak with a representative on the phone to get the correct address for your bank and location., Make sure you've got a valid endorsed check and a deposit slip from your bank filled out with your information. You may need other information, like a photocopy of your ID, so it's a good idea to speak with a representative from your bank before sending a check through the mail.
 You can't deposit any cash into your account this way, so make sure you're just mailing checks. There is typically a fee associated with this kind of transaction, however, so make sure you've exhausted all online and ATM options before you try to mail a check to deposit.

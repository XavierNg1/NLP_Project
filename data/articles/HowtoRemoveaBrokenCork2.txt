 Use a sharp knife that is thin enough to get into the opening of the bottle. For this method, you’ll have better luck if you use a flat knife and not a serrated one. The flat knife will be able to smoothly slide into the cork without as much resistance as a serrated knife.
 Push the knife about 1 inch (25 mm) into the cork. Don’t push the knife into the center of the cork. You need to get it in on the edge so that when you turn it you can make larger turns. You’re not unscrewing the cork as much as you’re turning the knife and cork together. This motion is more like turning a door knob than unscrewing a bottle cap.
 Pull up as you turn the knife. Be very careful here as you will now need to grip the flat part of the knife’s blade.









Wear gloves if you have some to protect your fingers.
Start turning the knife, very slowly, around the mouth of the bottle. The knife should be angled at roughly forty-five degrees to give it leverage.
You may have to try wedging the blade of the knife between the bottle and the cork, depending on how much cork you have to work with.
 Once you’re able to pull the cork up enough to get a good grip with your fingers, remove the knife.









As soon you don’t the need the knife as a wedge to pull up the cork, put it down and remove the remainder of the cork with your fingers. Then, enjoy your wine or champagne.

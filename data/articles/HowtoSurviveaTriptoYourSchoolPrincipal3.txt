Try to find other ways to be popular in school, like being good at sports or art., Always think about the potential repercussions of your actions before you do them. More than thinking about the punishment you may get for your actions, think about how they will affect other people's lives. Be compassionate for other people, and always think about how your actions will affect you and others.

 Sometimes you may feel like you don't have a choice with who we are friends with, but you do. If you have friends who are always getting into trouble and getting you in trouble, you need to stand up against them. Either let them know that you're tired of risking it and getting in trouble, or tell them that you can't hang out with them anymore. Doing this should cut down on how often you're getting into trouble.

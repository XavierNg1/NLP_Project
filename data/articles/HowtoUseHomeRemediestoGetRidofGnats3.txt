 Smear the front of a yellow index card with a thin layer of honey.


In theory, the color yellow attracts gnats. If you do not have yellow index cards, you could also try another bright color, or you could paste yellow construction paper onto a white index card.
Instead of the honey, you could also use another sticky substance, like petroleum jelly or a paste made from equal parts petroleum jelly and liquid dish soap. The honey smells sweet, which will help attract gnats, but other sticky substances may still work.
 Tape a stick to the back of the card so that at least half of the stick extends below the bottom edge of the card.


A popsicle stick or straw would also work.
Do not attach the stick to the honey-covered side of the card.
 Fix the stick into the soil so that the honey-coated side of the card faces out.


Fix one of these cards into the soil of each problematic plant.
Replace the card once it fills up with dead gnats.

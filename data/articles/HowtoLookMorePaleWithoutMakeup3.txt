 An easy way to make yourself appear paler is to wear black clothing or other dark colors. Dark clothing creates contrast so that your skin looks lighter by comparison. It’s an easy way to instantly look paler and more dramatic.
 If you are willing to dramatically change your appearance, dying your hair a dark brown or black, or even a deep maroon or purple, will make your skin look paler. Because your hair frames your face, a dark hair color provides the perfect backdrop to make your face look paler by comparison., It's well known that wearing black or brown eyeliner helps to emphasize eye and skin contrast, but if you don’t want to wear makeup, wearing colored contacts can also be a good solution. If you have blue eyes, consider wearing brown contact lenses to heighten contrast and make your skin appear paler.

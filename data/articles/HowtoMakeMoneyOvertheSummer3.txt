 Selling some stuff you don’t need or want can be a good way to get a little extra money. The first to do is to go through your things and work out what you can spare. Things like college and school books, clothes and shoes can all fetch good prices. But CDs and DVDs may not go for so much.


You can check some online shops to see what kind of price you can get.
 Textbooks that you are finished with can be some of the most valuable things you have, especially the very expensive medical and engineering books that all students on those courses have to buy. Be sure to describe the condition they are in accurately, and look around to see the kind of prices second hand copies are going for.


Lots of people will be trying to sell old books, so be realistic in your valuation.Advertise on campus as well as online.
 One good to way to shift a variety of bits and pieces that you have, without having to list them online and pay for postage and packing, is to have a yard sale, or go to a car boot sale. You will not be getting big prices for what you are selling, so have realistic expectations. But you can do a few things to increase your chances of making more money.Promote it well, so you get good footfall.
Have a clear pricing strategy so people don’t think you are just making it up as you go along.
Sell some drinks and snacks to your shoppers.
There is also the added bonus of getting rid of some of your old stuff.
 If you really need to bring in some money, it might be easier to sell a few things that can fetch a big price. You won't get much for dozens of old CDs, but a good stereo or piece of electrical equipment could be very lucrative.


Things like musical instruments can be worth a lot of money.
Don't make any rash decisions though. Once it's gone, you can't get it back.

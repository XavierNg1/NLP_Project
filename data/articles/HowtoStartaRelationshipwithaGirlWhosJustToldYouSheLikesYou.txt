 Don't go jumping around in front of her yelling out "YES!! She likes me! YEAH!". This isn't a good idea, it doesn't rate very high on the coolness scale. No matter what you're feeling inside, don't let it show too much. Obviously you don't have to be stony faced and speak in a monotone voice, but just don't get really worked up. Be cool.;
, Don't go up to her the next day and just ask her out. It'll seem a little weird, and you want to get to know her a bit first. So slowly build up a friendship. You don't have to become best friends, but just try to talk to her whenever you can, and be friendly. You'll find out whether you really like her for who she is, and you'll know more about each other.
 It's scary, but if she likes you then she'll probably agree. If you see her at lunch just going out of the canteen or talking to someone, politely go up to her and ask her if you two could speak to each other alone. Try not to do it when she's with a huge group, it may be a little embarrassing. Just stroll up to her and go, "Hey. Could i speak to you alone for a moment?"

, After you've asked if you can speak to her alone, just be brave and ask her out. Don't stutter or stumble, just ask her out straight. Okay, so maybe you could add more than a "Will you go out with me?". Something like, "I really like you. I was wondering if you wanted to go out sometime?" would be a lot better.
 Now you're relationship is at its maximum. Take it even farther! Don't go to fast and rush into kissing though! Start to hug and soon enough, she'll be all over you!

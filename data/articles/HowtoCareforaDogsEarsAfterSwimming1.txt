 Start by towel-drying your dog’s ears with a clean towel or washcloth. Soak up as much moisture as possible, and gently squeeze your dog’s ear to soak up water retained by the fur.Do not insert any portion of the towel down into your dog’s inner ear area. Use the towel for external drying only.
To get excess water out from your dog’s ear, use a cotton pad and dab gently along the opening of the ear canal. Do not force the pad down your dog’s ear canal.
Do not use a cotton swab, as this may cause pain for your dog and damage to their ears.;
, Many commercial pet ear cleaning products have drying agents in them, or you can make your own drying solution. Just squirt a small amount, between 3 to 5 drops depending upon the size of your dog, down around the opening of the ear canal.The feeling of the solution in your dog’s ear may cause them to want to shake it out. Steady your dog gently with your hands to keep the solution in as you clean.
Once you have applied the formula, massage the dog’s ear gently to help distribute the solution around the ear canal.
 Depending upon your dog’s ear size, use a cotton ball or section of a cotton ball and place it down at the opening of the ear canal. The section of cotton should be about as large as or slightly larger than the canal opening. Massage your dog’s ears with the cotton in place to absorb the solution and any additional liquids.Do not press too hard or massage too vigorously, as this may cause pain for your dog.
 Remove the cotton and check the ear to make sure there is no excess fluid. Good lighting or even a flashlight may help you better see down your dog’s ear canal.


If fluid remains, repeat the drying process one more time.
If the water maintains after the second drying, contact your vet for recommendations and further information.

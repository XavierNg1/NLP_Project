 If you are unable to immediately detect the wind's direction, throw a small piece of grass in to the air and watch its descent. Easterly winds, which blow from the east, can indicate an approaching storm front; westerly winds mean good weather. Strong winds indicate high pressure differences, which can be a sign of advancing storm fronts.
 The smoke should rise steadily. Smoke that swirls and descends is caused by low pressure, meaning rain is on the way.
 If the grass is dry, this indicates clouds or strong breezes, which can mean rain is coming. If there's dew, it probably won't rain that day. However, if it rained during the night, this method will not be reliable.
 Deciduous trees show the undersides of their leaves during unusual winds, supposedly because they grow in a way that keeps them right-side up during typical prevalent winds.
 Close your eyes and smell the air. Plants release their waste in a low pressure atmosphere, generating a smell like compost and indicating an upcoming rain.


Swamps will release gasses just before a storm because of the lower pressure, which leads to unpleasant smells.
A proverb says Flowers smell best just before a rain. Scents are stronger in moist air, associated with rainy weather., Many people can feel humidity, especially in their hair (it curls up and gets frizzy). You can also look at the leaves of oak or maple trees. These leaves tend to curl in high humidity, which tends to precede a heavy rain.


Pine cone scales remain closed if the humidity is high, but open in dry air.
Under humid conditions, wood swells (look out for those sticky doors) and salt clumps.

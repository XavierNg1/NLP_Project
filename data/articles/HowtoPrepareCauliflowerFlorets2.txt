 If desired, add 1 cup of milk to kettle. This will help keep the cauliflower white.



Optional: Add the juice of 1/2 lemon to the water instead of milk. The lemon juice should also help keep the florets whiter.
 Place the vegetable rack high enough above the water so that the water won't boil over onto the florets.
 Cover cauliflower with a lid.
 When a knife pierces the stem of the cauliflower easily, the vegetable is fully cooked. You want the cauliflower to be tender but still slightly crunchy at the core.


If you want to steam a cauliflower whole, the process will take about 17 to 20 minutes.
 Serve!

 If you're in a rush, Hamburger Helper can be prepared entirely in the microwave with the same basic approach as above. To start, crumble your beef into a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat the meat on high for about five to seven minutes or until any residual pinkness is gone. Break up the meat and stir at the three-minute mark.


Don't forget to crumble the meat as you put it in the bowl and to break it up halfway through the cooking process. Microwaving a single solid block of ground beef will lead to uneven cooking.
 Any of the draining techniques covered in the section above will work just as well here. Remember that, to avoid clogged drains, pour cooled grease into the garbage, not the sink.
 Stir well to combine in the bowl with the cooked ground beef.
 Stop the cooking to stir the mixture every five minutes or so. Don't cover the bowl completely as it cooks. You can use a microwave-safe lid to reduce splatters, but leave it open a crack so that steam and pressure do not build up in the container.


Use oven mitts or a towel to protect your hands when you stir. After a few minutes of cooking, the bowl will be very hot.
 Test the pasta for done-ness every time you stop to stir the casserole. Your dish is ready to serve when the pasta has a semi-soft texture that offers a little resistance (in other words, when it's "al dente"). Carefully transfer the hot bowl out of the microwave and let it cool somewhere safe for high temperatures (like an unused burner on the stove).


As in the method above, the cooling period is important â€” the sauce will continue to thicken even after the bowl is removed from the heat.

 Once you've whittled down the candidates, take walks with a few who did well in the interview. Allow the dog walker to take the leash if you feel comfortable and check whether the walker is calm and assertive with your dog and whether your dog is comfortable with them.Give them specific tips if you would like them to treat your dog in a certain manner (walk fast or slowly or let off the leash in certain areas). They won't know your preferences unless you impart this knowledge clearly. Watch both your dog’s and the walker’s body language throughout the walk. Do they seem comfortable with each other?
See whether the candidate seems to pay attention to your dog’s needs, like adjusting the speed or changing their tone of voice if necessary.
 Once you have interviewed potential dog walkers, be sure to call a few references for each of them. Be wary if each reference you call had concerns about the dog walker or refuses to even speak about them. You can also search online for reviews of your dog walker.


Possible questions for references include the following: “How long did the dog walker work for you?” “Did your dog enjoy the walker?” “Were there ever any issues, like fights or missing personal property?”

, Once you have chosen your dog walker, it is time to make the agreement formal. A standard contract between you and your dog walker should specify the rate, how often and in what manner you will pay, the amount of time the dog is to be walked each day, and the cancellation policy if either of you need to change the schedule on short notice.

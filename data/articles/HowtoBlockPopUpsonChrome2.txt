 This method should work for Chrome on any desktop operating system, including Windows, Chromebook, or Mac OS.


If you are using a Chromebook owned by your workplace or school, you may not be able to change your pop-up settings., It is located in the upper right menu and appears as 3 vertical dots.
 This will open a new tab with the Chrome Settings menu.
 This option is at the bottom of the page.
 This is located in the “Privacy” section of the settings and will open a another window with settings.
 This is located under the “Popups” header.
 On this same screen, you can click “Manage exceptions" and type in the URL of a website to add it to a whitelist that will allow popups from that site. This is useful if you frequently visit a website that has login information or important notices displayed in pop ups.


You can also select “Do not allow any site to run Javascript” from this menu under the “Javascript” header. This can also be very effective in blocking popup content. However choosing this option may also block some non-ad/non-popup content since Javascript is commonly used on many websites.
 This will close the window and save your settings. When Chrome blocks a popup, you will see an icon on the right side of the search bar that looks like a browser window with a red ‘x’.


You can also allow popups when visiting a site by clicking the blocked popup icon in the search bar and choosing to allow popups from that site.

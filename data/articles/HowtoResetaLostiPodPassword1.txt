 Though your phone is locked, it is possible to sync your device and back up your music before resetting your iPod. This is extremely important to do beforehand as you may lose files in the factory reset. Once you have completed backing up your iPod, you can disconnect it from your computer.;
, In order to restore your device to its factory settings, you must hold down the Home and Sleep buttons for 10 seconds. The screen should go dark and the iPod will begin to reboot.
 Only release the buttons when you see the Apple logo reappear. This indicates that the reset has been successful.
 Now that your iPod is reset, you will need to go through the initial guided setup process where you will be allowed to create a new password.

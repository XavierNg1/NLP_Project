 Pour the enchilada sauce, beef broth, and honey into a saucepan. Stir everything together with a wooden spoon. Bring the sauce to a simmer over low heat. Allow it to cook until it turns thick, about 20 minutes., Set a skillet on the stove. Pour enough oil into it to cover the bottom. Turn the heat up to medium, and allow the oil to get hot., Drag the tortilla across the rim of the saucepan to remove any excess sauce. Make sure that you cover both sides of the tortilla.

4-inch (10.16-centimeter) con tortillas are recommended for this recipe., Set the tortilla down into the skillet. If you have enough space, you can set down a few more sauce-coated tortillas as well. Fry the tortilla for 15 to 30 seconds, flip it over with a spatula, then fry it for 15 to 30 seconds more.This will sear the sauce into the tortilla., Fill half of the tortilla with your choice of shredded meat, then fold the other half over--like a taco., Stand the enchiladas upright, with the folded part against the bottom of the pan. They will look a little like tacos. Set the enchiladas down side-by-side until the pan is filled., Sprinkle the enchiladas with some crumbled cheese, chopped cilantro, and diced onion. If you have any leftover enchilada sauce, drizzle it on top., This is not absolutely necessary, but it will help make the enchiladas crispier. Preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C), then bake the enchiladas in the cast-iron skillet for 8 to 10 minutes., For an extra burst of flavor, serve them with some sliced avocado and lime wedges.

 Suppose for this task we're memorizing how to figure out the sine, cosine and tangent of the base angle of a right triangle.
 Mnemonics is simply a fancy word for a process you're probably familiar with from grade school. If you've ever used ROYGBIV to remember the colors (red orange yellow green blue indigo violet), or a nonsense sentence like "My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas" to remember the planets (Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto), you've used a mnemonic.
 If you have to memorize more items than you can make a short sentence or phrase for, this will be hard to work with; for this reason, the mnemonic method, like chaining, is best suited for limited numbers of items you have to memorize that can fit into a scheme. Mnemonics are better suited for memorizing a list of words, for instance; it is not as good for memorizing big lists without clear organization, like a list of phone numbers or the digits of pi.
 A mnemonic scheme is simply a "key" sentence or a phrase for what you have to memorize. For our example, we can make up a simple, easy to remember nonsense word.
 Your mnemonic serves as the 'key' to your memory. Scroll down to cover the previous list - can you remember what the mnemonic stands for?

 If your cat has been gagging, there may be an underlying problem. Infections may cause gagging, or your cat may gag because of mucus or debris caught in its nasal passages or throat. Your vet can do an exam to see if the gagging is caused by an underlying condition., Sometimes, a cat will gag and have other involuntary respiratory reflexes because of mucus caused by allergies or irritation. To help clear this up, your vet may prescribe an antihistamine or decongestant for your cat that will help with the gagging.If the gagging is connected with coughing, the vet may give the cat a cough suppressant.
 If your cat has a more serious problem, like an infection or inflammation, your vet may prescribe stronger medication. For infections, the cat will be given antibiotics. If the nasal passages or throat is inflamed and causing the cat to gag, it may be given steroids., Gagging may be a result of structural damage to the throat area. If the damage is mild, the vet may prescribe muscle relaxers that help the cat use its muscles.If the damage is severe, or if it has abscesses, your vet may recommend surgery to fix the damage.
 Softer cat food may help your cat swallow its food instead of gagging. You may temporarily switch to a soft food, or try adding warm water to dry food to make it mushy. Softer foods can go down the catâ€™s throat more easily.

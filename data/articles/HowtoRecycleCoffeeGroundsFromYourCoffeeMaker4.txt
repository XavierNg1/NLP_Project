 Just gutted a fish, cooked spicy food, peeled 4 heads of garlic and can’t get the smell out of your nails? Try rubbing some coffee grounds in your hands. The odor will be gone, and your hands will be left exfoliated and supple. Afterwards, wash your hands to get rid of the leftover grounds. Plus, you can get unpleasant scents in containers out by leaving a cup of coffee grounds in the area or even put some grounds in smelly shoes overnight.
 Ice cubes of frozen coffee can be used to make iced coffee later or even added to a protein shake for an extra kick of energy.
 Soaking white, office paper in leftover coffee or coffee grounds mixed with water can dye it and give it just the color for an antique look. You can then go on to use it to make cards or for scrapbooking.
 Acidic liquids help tenderize meat, and coffee has all the acid you need. Just add a small amount to your marinade and you’ll see some great results without an odd taste of coffee in your steak.

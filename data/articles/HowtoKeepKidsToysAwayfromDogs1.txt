 Kids’ toys are a favorite target for dogs. If you don’t want your dog playing with your kids’ toys, store them in an area where your dog can’t get to them.For example, place the toys in a storage bin in a closet. You could also place them on a shelf that your dog would not be able to reach.


Wherever you store the toys, make sure your kids can still find and access them.;
, When your kids have outgrown their toys, you may be tempted to give your dog those toys. However, this could be a problem if your dog is possessive with toys. If your kid wants the toy back, your dog could show aggressive behavior (growling, baring teeth, biting) when your kid reaches for the toy.The aggressive behavior is a sign of ‘resource guarding.' Your dog would consider the toy as its precious resource that shouldn't be taken away.Rather than giving your dog the kids’ old toys, donate them if they are in good shape. Discard them if they are worn or damaged.
Your dog and your kids should have their own sets of toys.
 If your kids play with their toys around your dog, your dog may try to take the toys away from your kids. To prevent this from happening, have your kids play in a separate room from your dog. When your kids are finished playing, have them put up their toys so your dog cannot get to the toys.


If your dog and kids are in the same room, consider telling your dog to lie down and stay in an area of the room away from your kids.
You could also put up a baby gate to separate your dog from your kids as they play.

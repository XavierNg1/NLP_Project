 A Korean folk game similar to wrestling, it is extremely popular during the festival. Two competitors wrestle in the center of a sandpitÂ and try to knock the other person over by using strength, skill and intelligence. It is a one on one tournament and the last person remaining wins the game.
 This is a folk dance especially performed by women. They usually link arms and dance in a circle under the moonlight.
 "So" and "Geobuk" literally mean "cow" and "turtle" in Hangeul. This celebration is a ritual performed by two people wearing a cape made of hanji and running around the local area as a cow and turtle, asking for foods from neighbors. The foods are often shared with relatives who can't afford Chuseok meals.

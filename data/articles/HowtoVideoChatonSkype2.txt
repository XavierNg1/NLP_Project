 Tap "People" to view all your contacts, then select "Online Contacts from the Contacts menu. You can also enter their name in the search field.
 Locate the person you want to do a video call with, then tap their picture or name. A window will open with several buttons.
 This will initiate the call, dialing the person. When they answer, they'll be displayed full-screen, while your image will be in a thumbnail that you can tap and drag to place on screen wherever it's convenient.


If you're on a voice call and want to switch to video, tap the camera icon at the bottom to switch to video.

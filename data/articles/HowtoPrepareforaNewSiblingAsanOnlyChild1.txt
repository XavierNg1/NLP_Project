 When your parents tell you that you're going to have a new baby brother or sister, act mature. Don't get all whiny about it; whining won't change anything.


Even though you may hate the idea of not getting what you want anymore, there is really no use in whining about it. It's happening whether you whine or not, and your parents could become annoyed with your whining.;
, Ask to go to the hospital with your parents so that you can welcome your new baby sibling to the world. You will probably have to wait a minimum of several months before your sibling comes out.
 A new sibling doesn't always mean trouble, and it certainly doesn't always mean that your parents will give your sibling more attention than they give you. Instead of thinking negative thoughts such as "My sibling will get all the love and everything that he wants, and I will get nothing", think positive thoughts such as "Me and my sibling will have an excellent relationship together".
 It is important to do this, as you are more likely to get over these negative thoughts than if you kept them to yourself. If you feel that your parents will give your sibling more attention than they give you, for instance, tell them that you'd prefer it if they gave you both equal attention. This is something important to tell them, since it is not good for your sibling to get all the attention, and it is not good for you to be ignored.
 Children's books tend to make you more confident that your new baby will not be such an annoying presence, especially if they are about older children adjusting to new siblings.

 The basic Pokémon types are: bug, dark, dragon, electric, fairy, fighting, fire, flying, ghost, grass, ground, ice, poison, psychic, rock, steel, and water.However, there are also special types and hybrids, flying/ice to give one example. Collect all like-type Pokémon in one section apiece.Organizing by type is one of the more popular ways to organize cards for active players of the Pokémon TCG. This is because you can easily search your collection for useful type combinations.
 Even after separating your cards by type, if you have many cards it will be difficult to navigate your type groupings without a little more organization.You should create a sub-category within your type groups. You can do this by ordering the cards alphabetically or by national number, to name two options.
 You may want to do this alphabetically, with bug coming first, then dark, then dragon, and so on. If you are an active player, you may want to have your most used type first, followed by your second most used type, and so on.

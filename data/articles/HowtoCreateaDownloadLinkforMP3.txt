 Most MP3 files that are downloaded from the Internet already have appropriate names since they were being used for download links. However, you should still check the name to make sure it meets the following criteria.


Keep the name of the MP3 file short. To do this you can just keep the main keywords in the filename and remove common words such as "and," "it" and "the."
The filename should reflect the name of the song or audio in the MP3 file. In general, try to use the title of the song and perhaps the name of the artist when you are renaming the file.
The MP3 file's name should not have any capitalization, spaces or punctuation marks because they are not recognized in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). If you use any of these grammatical elements you will end up with a broken hyperlink code when you create a download link for MP3 sharing purposes, and people will not be able to download the MP3.;
, You should be able to upload MP3 files on your website server using the same method that you had used to upload HTML files (web pages) for your website. The MP3 should be uploaded as a public file so anybody can access it.
 This is known as the link URL or destination URL (the destination where the MP3 is located) and can be seen using 1 of the following methods.


Right-click on the preview link of the MP3 file and copy the link location.
Open your website homepage which should be located on your domain URL. Add the complete filename of the MP3 file including the file extension at the end of the domain URL and copy the complete URL (domain address with the filename at the end).
 Use the following code "<a href="Link%20URL">Link Text</a>" and replace "Link URL" with the URL for the MP3 file and changing "Link Text" to the text that you want to appear for the link.

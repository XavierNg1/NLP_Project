 Although the procedures for military and overseas absentee voting is very similar, military voters may vote for state and local offices, while overseas voters may not.For the purposes of Wisconsin law, a military voter is a man or woman in the armed services, a Peace Corps volunteer, a member of the US Merchant Marine, an employee of the US Government, or the child or spouse of any of the above.An overseas voter is anyone in a foreign jurisdiction (not necessarily separated from the US by a body of water), either visiting or living there, who does not fit into those categories.Both overseas voters and military voters must have resided in the jurisdiction where they request a ballot immediately before either deployment or relocation.
 Although overseas voters must be registered to vote and military voters do not, both types can request an absentee ballot by printing form EL-121 and returning it to the appropriate municipal clerk’s office.


Form EL-121 is available at http://www.gab.wi.gov/sites/default/files/gab_forms/4/el_121_application_for_absentee_ballot_2016_06_p_51537.pdf. You may indicate on the form whether you want absentee ballots to be sent for one election or all elections for the year.The appropriate municipal clerk’s office may be found at https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/.Both military and overseas voters may transmit their ballot requests and their ballots via email or fax. Military absentee applications must be received by 5:00 p.m. on the Friday before the election, or 5:00 p.m. on Election Day if the military elector is away from their residence due to active duty during a federal election. Overseas absentee applications must be received on the Thursday before Election Day. No identification is necessary for either type of voter.

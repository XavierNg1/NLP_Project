 Add 2 parts of sugar to the glass container that you plan to store your scrub in. The jar or container should be approximately ⅔ full with the sugar. It’s important to leave space at the top to add the dish soap.You can make as large or as small batches of the scrub as you’d like by adjusting how much sugar you use. The scrub makes an ideal gift, so you can make a large batch, divide it between several jars, and give it out during the holiday season.
 When the sugar is in place, slowly begin to pour 1 part of a moisturizing liquid dish soap into the container. Stop after adding a small amount to mix it with the sugar for a thick paste-like consistency, and repeat the process until you’ve added all of the soap.You can find moisturizing liquid dish soap at the grocery store. It usually contains skin care ingredients that make more soothing and hydrating than other dish soaps.
If the consistency of your scrub isn’t right, simply add more sugar to make it thicker or mix in more soap to thin it out.
It’s usually easier to use a fork to mix the sugar and soap rather than a spoon.
 Once the scrub has reached the right consistency, add 3 to 5 drops of peppermint essential oil. Mix the oil in well with a fork to ensure that the scent is distributed throughout the scrub.If you prefer, you can use another essential oil. Lime, lemon, and lavender are all nice options.

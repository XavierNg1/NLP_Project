 Listen to different types of music. For example, if you normally just listen to pop, try techno, rap, or rock. Look for new singers or bands on YouTube or social media. Visit a few download sites and buy the songs you really like. Your interest in new forms of music will give you things to discuss with new and old friends., New hobbies can help you bond with people who like the same things. Join a sports team, take a knitting class, or take up some other form of recreational activity to do in your free time. Search online or read through campus bulletin boards for these opportunities to make new friends., If you're a student, check your school's website for volunteer opportunities with campus clubs. If you're not a student, search the web for local opportunities with your favorite organizations or causes. Just a few hours a week could put you in touch with several potential new friends. It'll also give you a chance to show off your caring self.

 If you have not already, wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner. Run a wide-toothed comb through your hair to undo any tangles, if necessary. Allow your hair to hair dry partway before continuing.
 Plan on having the top three-quarters up in the bun, and the bottom forth loose. You will be winding this hair around the straws first.
 Just remember, each time you let down another layer of hair, you will need to apply more mousse to that layer.
 Choose a section closest to your face. Smooth out any flyaways using your fingers or a comb.
 If the straw has a bendy tip, you might want to cut that part off. You will be weaving the hair section around the straw.
 Sandwich the hair between the two sides of the straw. Bring the straw as close to your roots as possible. Weave the hair around the two sides of the straw in figure-eights. Try to keep the hair as tight as possible.
 When you have no hair left to weave, pinch the two ends of the straw together. Wrap a mini hair elastic around the two ends of the straw, pinning the hair shut between them.
 When you reach the other side of your hair, undo the bun and let down the next layer of hair. Half of your hair should now be loose. Pull the top half of your hair up into a bun. If you applied styling mousse to your hair before, apply it to this new layer now.
 You should have four rows of hair-wrapped straws.
, This can take several hours. If you are going to sleep with the straws in your hair, you might want to tie a head scarf around your hair, or sleep on a satin pillowcase. This will help reduce friction and frizz.
 Start with the bottom-most layer. Take a straw closest to your face, and pull the hair elastic off. Grip the straw by the folded end, and carefully slide it out of your hair. Finish pulling the straws out of the bottom-most row before you move onto the next.
 If you brush your hair, it will turn frizzy. If the crimps are too tight for your liking, you can fluff them out a little with your fingers.,

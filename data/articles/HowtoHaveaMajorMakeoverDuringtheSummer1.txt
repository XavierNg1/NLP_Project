 If you weren't in great shape during the previous school year, then get in shape! Eat healthier foods, and exercise!


If you don't like to exercise, there are some fun ways to still get it in like swimming, running with friends, dancing, and you can even burn calories while cooking and shopping!






People will really notice when you go back to school.;
, All through the summer keep your hair clean by shampoo and conditioning every two days, or every day. You can even buy a hair mask to use occasionally.


If you want, you can even get a new cut! But at least make sure that a couple days before school starts you get a haircut to get rid of split ends.






You should also get your eyebrows done professionally at a beauty salon and start straightening or curling your hair.
 If you don't already, shave. Shaving helps promote more hygiene. Be hygienic. Also, consider getting a tan. At least become a 2 or 3 shades darker than you were before.


You can achieve a safe tan either by getting a spray tan or by using a tanning lotion. Stay away from tanning beds, which will really harm your skin.
Never go out in the sun without using sunscreen.(Don't tan if you're already tanned.) Also, use lotion every night for rich, soft skin. Shower daily.
 If you have freckles, love them! Freckles make you look sun-kissed. But if you don't like them, use sunscreen or try washing your face with lemon juice.


Get rid of all acne by washing your face twice everyday and giving yourself a facial once in a while. Keep your face soft by using an oil-free moisturizer.
 You don't need a lot, but you should get a tinted moisturizer (works as a foundation), concealer, blush, bronzer, lipgloss and mascara. These items will really make a difference in your look.
 For fingernails, give yourself a manicure every two weeks by soaking, cleaning, cutting, and filing them, and then either apply nail polish or leave them plain.


A french manicure always looks good on fingernails. For toenails, do the same thing except make sure you paint them a color, which always looks better.
Keep your hands and feet soft by applying lotion too.
 Shop 'til you drop! Get some cute items and make sure your style is neat, tidy, and it can really affect your summer makeover!

  Use a round one for best results.  Any size will do.  Just remember: the larger the hoop, the larger the finished project, and you want the mat to fit on the seat of your chair, so size it accordingly.  


You can also use a hula hoop to make an even larger mat. A hula hoop also gives you more space to work with.
  These will be your warps and wefts.  (See tips for definitions.)

,  (These are the warps)  Use as many as needed to fill the hoop without crowding it.  Smaller projects may use as few as 4, whereas larger projects may use more than 12.  It is ideal that the warps be the same color.
  Pull it snug, but be careful not to tear your material.
, Form a tight spiral, keeping the material snug, but not tight.  Push together two loops at the top and treat them as one warp.  This creates an odd number of warps.  As you go around, be sure to go under the warp that you went over last time.  Continue this method until your spiral is about 5-8" across.
  It is very important to maintain your odd number of warps.
 Take care not to pull the weave tighter as you go, or you'll end up with a basket shape; just stay consistent.
  Wrap it around a nearby warp and tie it firmly.  Tuck the ends in.
  Tie the ends in pairs.  Trim to make a fringe or tuck in, depending on the desired look.
 Put the mat on the chair's seat and sit on down.

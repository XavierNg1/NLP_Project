 While it may be tempting to indulge in a hot shower or bath in the cold winter months, doing so will strip your entire body's skin of moisture and leave it vulnerable to dryness and chapping.Warm showers will save energy and preserve the natural moisture on your face and body.
In addition to watching the temperature, keep your shower or bath quick. The longer you are in water of any temperature, the more of your natural oils you will wash away.
 Dry, cold winter air requires changes to your living space in order to protect your skin from damage.


Keep the thermostat down. Using central heating is particularly bad for the skin, as it can cause it to dehydrate which results in itchiness and dry patches. If you have a radiator heating system, use it instead.
Turn on the humidifier. Dry winter air causes dry winter skin, so hook up the humidifier to add moisture back to the air, which will be absorbed by your skin., In addition to adjusting the way you live in your own home, avoiding other hazards can help protect your facial skin through the winter months.


Winter air tends to trap chemical air pollution close to the ground, making smog more of a problem in the cold months. Smog pollution in the air turns to free radicals, which researchers believe can damage the outer layer of the skin and cause premature aging.Try to minimize time you spend outdoors in commuter cities and other areas with high levels of air pollution.Watch out for winter sunburn. Many people forget to apply their sunscreen in the winter months, but sun damage and sunburn is just as much a concern during the cold months as during the hot months. During the winter, you are likely to cover your entire body to stay warm, but your neck and face remain exposed most of the time. This can lead to increased risk of skin cancer if you don't remember to apply your sunscreen daily.

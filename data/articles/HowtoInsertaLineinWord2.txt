 You'll need to be on a blank line, as this won't work if there is text before or after your cursor on the same line. You'll be creating a horizontal line that spans from one edge of your page to the other. The line will stop at your set margins.
 Use your dash key on the number row at the top of your keyboard, or on the numeric pad.
 This will automatically create a solid line that will situate itself directly beneath the previous line of text. Note that the line does not occupy the space of a line of text, but instead exists between lines of text.
 There are a variety of different lines that you can create by using characters other than the dash:*** will create a dotted line.

___ will create a bolder solid line.

=== will create a double line.

### will create a three-stripe line, with a bold center stripe.

~~~ will create a line made of carets.
 You can click and drag the line to move it up and down a little on the page. You can't move it outside of the "line" that it currently occupies.

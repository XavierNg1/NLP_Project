 Hold a magnifying glass up to your pottery in natural daylight. Look for cracks, peeling glaze, and prior repairs. Donâ€™t use a wet cleaning method if your pottery has any of these issues.Avoid wet cleaning if your pottery is hand painted.








Painted pottery may have been sealed with a spray glaze which is not tough like kiln-fired glazes.
 Plug the air hole in the bottom of a figurine, if applicable. Use a piece of tape if the object is unglazed. Otherwise, use a plastic bag or other waterproof object. Make sure that the ventilation hole is completely blocked off.








When you soak a figurine with air holes, you want to avoid getting water inside of the figurine. This can result in long-term structural damage to some ceramics.
 Line a sink or large container with at least one thick bath towel. Fill your container with warm water and add mild dishwashing detergent. Submerge your pottery for just a few seconds. Clean any problem areas with a soft washcloth.








Putting bath towels down can prevent your pottery from cracking if you accidentally drop it when your hands are soapy.

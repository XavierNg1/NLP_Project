 It is recommended to use a twin sheet, though a full sheet can work (especially if you are taller). Fold the sheet lengthwise until it is the desired length of the final dress. For a short toga, fold the sheet in half. For a longer toga, fold down only the top 6” to 1’.
 This should be done such that one half covers the back of your body and the other half covers the front. The folded down section should be at the top and outside of the rest of the material.
 Use a single pin for each shoulder or a number of pins. Pin the front section of sheet to the back section of sheet where your clavicle meets with your shoulder. You can buy fancy pins for the occasion or you can use 2” or similar round button (like political buttons).
 A hole should have been formed by the pinning on the side where the front of the sheet meets the back. Place your arm through this hole.
 Use string, a ribbon, or a tight fitting belt to tie the waist. You will probably need to overlap the open sides a bit before you secure the waist, to ensure that your skin is not exposed.
 Have fun telling people that this is a historically accurate Greek dress...if you’re into that kind of thing.

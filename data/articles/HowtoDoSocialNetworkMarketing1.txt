 Here's an excellent guide to learn how: Create a Facebook Profile.;
, Facebook allows you to import your existing friends, add suggested friends and/or search for friends either by name or email address. This will allow you to build a large network of friends quickly. Once you have friends and have built a relationship with them, it’s easier to let them know about your website and your business.
 Here you will see any events you have been invited to as well as an opportunity to create your own event by clicking “Create an Event” highlighted in green.
 Be sure to add the street address! Then click “Create Event.”

, This also allows your friends to see your event without sending them emails. Very convenient! You can also add details of your event (highly recommended) to give your potential guests a chance to know more about your special event. Adding a picture is also recommended because people remember pictures more than words and it stands out amongst a sea of posts!

, What’s an event without friends! Although you already posted your event, not everyone checks their Facebook everyday. By sending an invitation, each friend will receive an email about your event. You can select All to invite all your friends to your event or choose a select number by either highlighting their picture or typing their name. Adding a personal message is optional, but adds a nice touch. When they receive your email, they can choose: “Attend” “Maybe” or “Not Attending.”


Voila! Your event is all set and everyone is informed! You can always go back and make changes if needed, promote the event using Facebook advertising, add pictures and videos to make it more appealing, etc. Most importantly, try to have fun with this. If you enjoy it, so will they!

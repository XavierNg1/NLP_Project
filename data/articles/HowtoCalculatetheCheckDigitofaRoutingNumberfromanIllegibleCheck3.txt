 When processing your check, financial institutions need a reliable way of identifying your bank. It is important that they do not confuse it with other banks.Sometimes banks have similar names, so relying on the name of a financial institution alone could result in confusion.
Some banks may have more than one routing number, depending on its location or the type of check being used. But no two banks will ever have identical routing numbers.
 Routine tasks such as direct deposit and automatic bill transfers rely on accurate routing numbers. The routing number is also used to facilitate money transfers, such as cashing checks or wiring money.Since the numbering system and MICR form are consistently used across all financial institutions, these automated tasks can be processed with hardly any delay.
 The routing number is printed on the bottom left-hand corner of your check. Also, some banks may publish their routing numbers online. This is helpful for customers who need the routing numbers for wire transfers or other transactions.Having your bankâ€™s routing number so easily available is not a security risk. It only becomes a security risk if someone has your routing number and your account number.

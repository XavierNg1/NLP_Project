 It should feel comfortable and fit you properly. Look for the following:


Make sure you have at least 1 inch (2.5Â cm) of room on either side of your hips and thighs when you sit.
The seat should be short enough that it shouldn't hit you on the back of the knees.
The seat should be designed in such a way that your weight is distributed evenly when you sit on it.;
, You should be able to adjust it so that while you are seated, your knees are level with your feet on the floor. You should have an easy time adjusting the lever while seated.



Some chairs have cushions that you can adjust to fit your preference; that would be best if the chair will have multiple users.
If you're selecting a chair for yourself, sit with your back flush against the chair back to test if it is comfortable for you. Make sure the back rest is large enough to support both your lower back and your hips. If a chair is too narrow through the hips it can force you to sit forward, leaving your thighs without support.
 Find out if the chair's cushioning adequate; if it is not, it can become deformed. Fatigue can set into the back and hip area if there's not enough cushion support.
 You should be able to move your back into different positions comfortably throughout the day.
 If you find it difficult to perform these tasks in the chair, then keep looking. You haven't found the ergonomic chair for you., An ergonomic chair will have armrests that you can adjust in and out to fit your comfort level.

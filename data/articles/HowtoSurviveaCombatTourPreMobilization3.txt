 On the day of the order of mobilization will be the last day the soldiers and families will be together. On this day, families must be strong mentally as will as the Soldiers. Kiss them So-long and let them depart knowing that their family is taken care of. They're be crying. To soften the blow, let it flow. Soldiers-let your family run their course now, so let your spouse start taking care of children. Not only does being overbearing counter-productive but it provides a negative precedence to the one who will be in charge.
 For Soldiers who have young children above 5 years old, don't let them be excluded in being part of the deployment process. Kids need to be informed also of this major disruption in their lives. Ask yourself this question: How would you react if one day, your child waves their hand and just go out the door without telling you where they are going or when they come back? Set some time before you actually leave in telling them why you are going and when you should come back.(PLEASE DO NOT TELL THEM ON DAY OF!) Assure your children know that they are not the reason why you'll be leaving. Finally, provide them with responsibilities while you are going. It's always nice to tell your daughter to make sure to help out Mom in the kitchen or your son to dad take out the trash

 If you focus on directions and not on road safety, you are more likely to cause a driving collision.;
, You should always be looking ahead, anticipating cars braking and people crossing the road. Ideally, you should be aware of what's going on up to 15 to 20 seconds ahead of you so you can respond accordingly and safely.
 With text messaging becoming so popular, many states are making it illegal to text while driving so as to avoid driving accidents. If you are afraid you may be tempted, put your phone away. Consider investing in a Bluetooth so you can use the phone hands-free. Don't be distracted by children. Explain that they need to stay quiet while driving. The sooner they understand safe driving, the better. If children become unruly, pull the car over when it is safe and deal with them.
 You should be able to see the back tires of the car in front of you touching the road.
 If you are forced to get on the road, drive slowly, brake sooner, and increase the distance between you and the driver in front.
 It is safer to just let obnoxious drivers pass on by. Getting aggravated will only negatively impact your driving and possibly cause a car accident.
 When safe, look over your shoulder and confirm that it is clear for you to make your move.
 And always use your signals so other drivers know what you are doing.
 Check your tire pressure, wipers, wiper fluid, lights, and brakes often, but especially before heading out on long journeys. Always keep your inspections up to date.

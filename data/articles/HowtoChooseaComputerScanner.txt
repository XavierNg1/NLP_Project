 The type of scanner needed for home-use will be very different from that needed for business applications or heavy usage.;
, The resolution of scanners needed for business applications changes with requirement. For example, scanners required for cutting-edge photographic work requires high resolution while normal text scanning for business purposes requires normal resolution.
Bit Depth - Scanners with higher bit depths tend to produce better color images.Today, most color scanners are at least 24-bit and are perfect for normal use. For those wanting better image quality, 30 and 36-bit scanners are available.
Dynamic Range - Another important criteria for evaluating a scanner is the unit's dynamic range. It is a measure of how wide a range of tones the scanner can record. Most color scanners have a dynamic range of about 2.4. It is a good idea to go for a scanner that offers a higher dynamic range depending on your budget.
Speed - Speed becomes a factor when purchasing a scanner for commercial purposes. Heavy users will need a scanner with a high scanning speed. Most home scanners have optimum speeds for home and light use. However, the speed is the biggest factor in pricing, so choose wisely. The scanning speed can be determined by taking a few sample scans.
 If it is too costly, find out which feature of a scanner you will require most for your purpose and choose a scanner which scores high for that particular feature and a little less on others.

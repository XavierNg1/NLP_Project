 You can use a hole punch to punch some holes along the side of your card and string a ribbon through the holes or use craft scissors to cut a patterned shape along the edges of your card.
 Cut out different shapes in colored paper and glue them onto the top of your card to add a splash of color and a thicker surface.


This is a great way to make use of scrap paper.
You can tie a ribbon around an additional piece of paper that you glue down to your template for a fun and fancy creative touch.
 If you have a little bit of extra time, you can turn the card into a mini graphic novel. Divide the card into a grid and tell a little story. Draw pictures of you and your recipient using a fun memory from your past.
 Tailor the card’s decorative details to the recipient. For example, if it’s your mom's birthday and she loves gardening, add a stamped flower image or draw the outline of a flower with glue and cover it in glitter.

 You want to have two times the amount of wax flakes than your jars' ounces.For example, an 8 oz jar will need 16 oz. of wax flakes. Use a heat-resistant glass measuring cup with a handle, such as a Pyrex cup, to measure and then later melt the flakes.


When choosing wax flakes, soy based wax burns longer than paraffin and some people prefer it as a natural ingredient.
Make sure that you buy wicks that are meant for soy candles if you choose to use soy instead of paraffin wax.
 All you will need is a medium sized pot or saucepan and a stovetop range. Place the measuring cup on the side of the pot and fill the pot with water. You want a lower level of water so that the water doesn't splash into the wax as it boils.
 You don't want a full rolling boil because that may cause the wax to overheat. Stir the wax with a wooden spoon as it melts so that all of the flakes are equally liquefied., You want to keep the temperature of the wax between 150°-180° F or 65°-80° C. Do not leave the wax unattended. This is so that it doesn't overheat but is mostly for safety. At these temperatures wax can burn skin easily.
 Break off small pieces of non-toxic wax crayon pieces to add a hue to the wax. A little bit goes a long way, so add the crayon in increments of a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) piece at a time.You can test out the color intensity as you go by dropping a little wax onto some parchment paper and letting it cool as the wax finishes melting.
 Once it reaches these temperatures and is fully melted, set the measuring cup aside. Let the wax cool down to 125° F or 50° C. You cannot add the essential oils or scents at a higher temperature because the scent can evaporate away. , For every 16 oz. of wax flakes, use ten drops of essential oils.You can mix and match scents and oils for a unique candle. For scent ideas, reference your own favorite candle scents or smell different oil combinations to determine what meshes and what clashes.

 Vellum curls and looks wet when used with wet glues, so most vellum glue is sold in tabs that do not distort the surface of the paper. Vellum pens are formulated differently because pens intended for paper can blur and take a long time to set on the plasticized surface.


Make sure that any glue you use with vellum is acid-free.;
, Although you may use vellum to layer, make envelopes and crimp, like you do with normal paper, vellum tears easily. Work slowly and deliberately with this material.
 Wash your hands before handling vellum and after you use glue. Oils can gather on vellum paper if you touch it too often.
 The overlay effect will be strong if you can still see a muted image or color underneath the vellum. Use this overlay effect to soften the look of your scrapbook.

 Cut 14 ounces (397 grams) of boneless, skinless chicken thighs into chunks. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, to taste, and sprinkle with two tablespoons of flour. Melt one tablespoon of butter over a skillet and add the chicken chunks.Place the chicken chunks in a single layer. Don’t allow them to pile up on each other.
After five minutes of frying, turn the chicken chunks over and allow them to fry on their opposite side for another five minutes.
 Once the chicken is finished, place it in a bowl. Put 8.8 ounces (250 grams) of sliced button mushrooms in the pan and sauté them for five minutes. Flip them over on their opposite side for another five minutes. Add one small diced onion and sauté it along with the mushrooms., Deglazing is the process of diluting or removing food residue before making a sauce. To deglaze the pan in anticipation of making chicken stroganoff, pour ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of vermouth in the skillet along with the onions and mushrooms. Turn up the heat and allow the vermouth to boil until it is almost entirely evaporated., Pour one cup (240 milliliters) of chicken stock, one tablespoon of tomato paste, one bay leaf, and five sprigs of thyme, and the fried chicken you plated earlier. Cover over medium-low heat for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, remove the lid and allow to simmer for another 10 minutes.The sauce should be thick and red.
 Slowly scoop spoonfuls of the chicken sauce into 1/3 cup (80 milliliters) of sour cream. Continue to add the chicken sauce to the sour cream until the mixture is lukewarm. Then, transfer the diluted sour cream into the skillet with the rest of the chicken, mushroom, and sauce. Stir to combine.Once the sour cream has been mixed into the sauce, serve the chicken stroganoff. This chicken stroganoff tastes great over rice, egg noodles, or another pasta of your choice.
Add salt and pepper to taste.

 One easy way to avoid getting sunburned is to wear clothing that blocks the sun when you're outside. Wide hats and sunglasses are a good place to start, but pants and long-sleeved shirts add even more protection., When the sun is the strongest, it's best to stay out of it altogether. Between 10 am and 2 pm, try to stay away from the sun's strong rays to help protect yourself.In areas where the sun is out longer (nearer the equator), 4 pm may be a better end time.
 If you can't avoid the sun altogether by going inside, find some shade outside. Get under an awning or tree. You could even carry an umbrella with you to protect you from the sun.

 If this is your first try, use a cheap one so that you can practice.
, A circle or oval are good choices, or perhaps a square or triangle. Draw this shape into the middle of the adhesive plastic, then cut out with a sharp knife. Stick the sheet onto the vase or jar, carefully placing the geometric hole in the central position.


Keep the cut out adhesive plastic shape for use next.
 Cut the shape out.


Ideas for the shape include flowers, symbols, letters, animals, sun or moon, etc. Keep the design very simple; use stencil books or webpage designs for inspiration.
 Then carefully cut out this shape from the plastic using a sharp craft knife. Go slowly, as this needs to be well defined.
 Smooth out any edge bubbles or ripples so that it sits entirely flat against the glass.


A thumbnail run over the edges will flatten out air bubbles nicely.
 This will be the glass that goes from the edge of the design to the edge of the geometric shape.


Apply thickly with a flat brush or sponge brush. Use smooth strokes.
Follow any additional instructions provided with the etching cream.
 Then rinse off with water.
 You should be left with a pretty design inside a geometric shape. Well done!

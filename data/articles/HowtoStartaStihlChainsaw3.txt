 If you must start your chainsaw on uneven ground, Stihl recommends an alternate technique for safety reasons. First of all, use your foot to clear any debris away from your site, and make a small impression in the ground you can use to support your foot., Brace the handle against your body, just above the knee. This will give you greater control over the chainsaw., Keep your left hand on the chainsawâ€™s handlebar, and lock your elbow. Use your right hand to start the chainsaw, then follow the same directions for pulling the starter rope and starting your tool as you would when beginning from a sitting position.

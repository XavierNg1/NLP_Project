 For shorter flights, you may be offered a snack option like raw nuts or pretzels. Try to go for the nut option, as it has a higher protein content than pretzels. It will likely contain salt, however, so you should make sure you drink a lot of water with your nuts while on the plane., Often, your food options on the plane will not be very healthy or nutritious, full of refined carbohydrates that will end up making you feel fatigued or low energy. Instead of having the pasta or bread option, choose the vegetarian option or the vegetable heavy option.If fish is offered on the menu, you may want to go for this option, as fish is a lean protein that will be easier for your body to digest.
 There is often a lot of sugar, preservatives and artificial flavorings in the packaged sauces and dressings given to you on the plane as part of your in flight meal. Try to avoid these options and keep your food fresh and preservative free., Use a filtered water bottle or ask for bottled water on the flight, as the tap water on your flight may not be safe to drink. Try to have at least 8 ounces of water for every hour you are in the air., Opt for herbal teas that are caffeine free and skip coffee or sodas, as well as alcoholic beverages. These beverages can dehydrate you further. Instead, opt for herbal tea or plain hot water.

 You can do this using the following Start menu sequence: Start button >> All Programs >> EA Games >> Need for Speed Underground 2, or by double clicking its Desktop icon if one is added there.
 After the pre-game cinematics have played, the game will display the message “Press Enter Key” message. DO NOT press Enter.
 While still at the “Press Enter Key” screen, key in one or all of these cheat codes:


“needperformance1” to unlock all Level 1 car performance mods.
“needperformance2” to unlock all Level 2 car performance mods.
“gimmevisual1” to unlock all Level 1 car visual mods.
“gimmevisual2” to unlock all Level 2 car visual mods.
After keying in any of the cheat codes, DO NOT press Enter if you wish to type in an additional code. If you wish to type in a second code, just go on typing the next code. For instance, to activate both the Level 1 car performance and Level 1 car visual mods cheat codes, you’d need to type in: needperformance1gimmevisual1.
 After you have typed in the codes for all the Mods you want, press Enter to go to the game’s Main Menu. You will thus have unlocked your Mods!

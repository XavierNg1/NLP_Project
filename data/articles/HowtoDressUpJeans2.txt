 On its own, a plain shirt and jeans may still look casual, but the combination makes a perfect blank canvas for tailored jackets, sparkly shoes, and rich accessories. Stick with solid colors over graphic tees, and gravitate toward neutral colors like white, black, and brown for the greatest versatility.
 A fitted button-down shirt looks crisp, clean, and business-like, especially when matched with dark jeans. Look for one in a plain color or one with vertical pinstripes.
 Look for a bold color that suits your skin tone. The sophistication of your top will likely prove more than enough to counteract the casual nature of your jeans.
 Shy away from bulky sweaters and stick with stylish cuts. Consider one with an interesting neckline, such as a boat neck, v-neck, or crew neck.
 Bold, bright prints, like geometric designs, often create a sophisticated look.
 Less daring prints, such as floral print, may create a softer, more delicate look.
 Pick out a playful, flowing spring or summer sundress to throw over a pair of skinny jeans. Gravitate toward knee-length dresses. Also stick with dresses that are a little more casual in nature, rather than formal dresses or work dresses.
 Lace and other similar embellishments automatically make a top look classier. This extra class will help your jeans to look dressier, as well.

 VNI uses the digits row to add tones and diacritical marks. While it is the easier one to learn, it may take slightly longer to type since a 4th row is involved.
 Tone marks can be typed any time after a vowel is typed, and the software will automatically place the marks at their correct places. For example, to type "má" (mother), you need to type "ma1"; to type "mã" (code), type "ma4". The tone does not need to directly follow the vowel, so to type "mạng" (web), you can either type "ma5ng", "man5g", or "mang5" (note that m5ang is not accepted).

Sharp tone ('dấu sắc') is 1
Hanging tone ('dấu huyền') is 2
Asking tone ('dấu hỏi') is 3
Tumbling tone ('dấu ngã') is 4
Heavy tone ('dấu nặng') is 5

, Similar to tone marks, they can be typed at any point after the letter that it is supposed to be placed on. You only need to type once if there are 2 horns in a word; for example, to type "xương" (bone), type "xuong7"

Circumflex (found in â, ê, ô) is 6
Horn (found in ơ, ư) is 7
Breve (found in ă) is 8
Crossbar (found in đ) is 9
The 0 key is used to erase the tone mark or diacritical mark in that word.

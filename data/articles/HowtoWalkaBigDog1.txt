 Both the leash and the collar can be used to control the dog, but some brands and types work different for different kinds of dogs. Knowing the correct option can be something difficult to ascertain.Use a simple leash and collar. This option works well for balanced dogs who understand their place in the pack (i.e. subservient to the human) and do not cause issues on walks. Choose this option if your dog has a happy demeanor and no obedience issues. Try a slip collar. For more difficult dogs, those distracted by a variety of things on the walk, the slip collar can be a great option.The corrections made by slip collars pinch the brachial nerve and imitate how mature dogs nip at the necks of their puppies for social purposes.The Pack Leader Collar (PLC) is a great option for difficulties with slip collars. While slip collars may cause issues, the PLC fits around the neck towards the head. By placing focus there, the dog has less pulling power and less control. Using this collar is a great way to keep the dogâ€™s nose up and away from distractions.Use a harness. For many dog owners, a body harness or "Halti" head collar might be preferable, especially if your dog tends to pull. Some of these products, like the Halti, have the ability to steer and muzzle the dog, as well as stop them from pulling.;
, The more stiff your clothing and footwear, the more likely a large dog will be to pull you off balance. And the greater chance you can be scuffed up or injured. Think tennis shoes over high heels, and jeans over dress pants.
 Many dog trainers and walkers recommend positive reinforcement with animal training. Bring small meats, cheeses, or processed snacks specifically designed for dogs. Try experimenting with the flavors to which your dog responds best. Lead with a treat. One quick trick is to walk with the treat in front of the dog's nose. Like the proverbial carrot on a stick, the dog will follow the scent and walk along your side.

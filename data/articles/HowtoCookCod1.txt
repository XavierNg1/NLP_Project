 Pour 2 quarts (2 L) of vegetable oil or canola oil into a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven and heat on medium to medium-high until the oil reaches a temperature of 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).


You could also use a heavy-bottomed stockpot or deep-fryer.
Use a candy thermometer to measure the temperature of the oil);
, Whisk in the milk and water afterward until the batter just barely combines.


Note that the batter will still appear lumpy once ready. Do not over-beat the batter in an attempt to remove all the lumps.
 Dunk each cod fillet into the batter and coat all sides well.


You can either coat each piece of cod immediately before frying it or coat all the pieces at once and store them on a baking sheet sprinkled with a light coating of flour until ready to fry. The former option will prevent each piece from losing batter, but the latter may prove more convenient.
 Place each piece of cod into the hot oil and fry one at a time until the batter turns deep golden-brown.


Shake off any excess batter before frying by holding each piece of cod over the bowl of batter and allowing the excess to drip off.
Monitor the temperature of the oil as you fry the fish. Increase or decrease the heat to maintain a temperature of 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).
The inside of each piece should be opaque and should flake apart with a fork.
 Use a heat-resistant slotted spoon to scoop each piece of fish out of the oil and drain the cod on paper bags or paper towels for several minutes. Serve hot.

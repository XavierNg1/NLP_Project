, Your growing seedlings need to be protected from the cold temperatures, so make sure that you put a protective cover overtop of them in this early stage while they’re fragile. Do this at least two months before your area’s estimated final frost of the year., Harden off your plants by taking them outside little by little to get used to the sun, rain, and cold before exposing them to the elements permanently., The plants should be about 4 inches tall at this point, so they’re ready to be transplanted. Remove the plants from their pot. Carefully tip the pots upside down to remove the plant and root ball. Dig a hole twice as wide and at least as deep as the pot your rhubarb is in.If the plant doesn’t come out with a little squeeze to the sides of the pot, you can use a butter knife to cut around the soil. It also helps to water the plants about an hour before your remove them from their pots.
If you used a peat pot or a cow pot you can simply place the pot with the plant into the soil.
 Prepare a suitable part of the garden. Choose somewhere cool that the rhubarb can happily grow at its own pace. Clear out enough space in the ground so that you can plant the roots 36-48 inches (90-120 cm) apart. Planting any closer together will crowd the plants.

In warmer climates it is important to find shade for your plants during hotter months. You can plant the rhubarb by tall shade plants (tomatoes, pole lima beans), or create shade with a shade cloth., In order to allow your plants to thrive, you’ll need to keep them consistently and evenly moist. They’ll die if the sun dries their roots out. Mulching will keep the rhubarb roots properly cool and moist.

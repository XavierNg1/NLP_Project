 Here's what you'll need for apple cake:


3/4 cup flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
4 apples
2 eggs
3/4 cup sugar
Pinch of salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted

,, For this recipe you can use a standard cake pan or a springform pan, which has removable sides and is nice if you're serving the cake at a party.
 It should come to room temperature before you incorporate it with the other ingredients.
 Place the flour, salt and baking powder in a bowl and whisk them together.
 Use a knife or a vegetable peeler to peel the apples, then remove their cores. Slice the apples into bite-sized chunks.
 Mix together the sugar, eggs, butter, and vanilla.
 Stir until the batter is smooth and creamy.
 Use a spatula to gently incorporate the apples into the batter. Don't over mix the batter, since this will lead to a dense, stiff cake.
 Use the spatula to smooth the top of the batter so it's even.
 It's ready when the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.

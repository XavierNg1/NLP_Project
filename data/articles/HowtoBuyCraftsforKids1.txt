 For example, sticker foam crafts are more suitable for young children. Painting, beading and clay are good choices for older children. Sewing and model building are best for teenagers.


Selecting age-appropriate crafts that children are capable of successfully completing will build self-esteem.






Many crafts will list an age range on the box.

Small children do not need projects containing small items such as beads. They can easily choke on small materials.






Older children can handle permanent markers, oil pastels, glitter and pottery wheels more safely and with less chaos, confusion and mess than younger children.






Items that state "non-toxic" on the package are best.






Healthier choices include white glue and glue sticks over rubber cement (with hexane or heptane), tempera paints and poster paints rather than spray or acrylic paints (containing ammonia,formaldehyde and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic), homemade, earth-based or flour-based clays instead of polymer clays (made of vinyl or PVC) and washable markers, crayons and colored pencils in the place of dry-erase markers (with alcohol or ketone).


Refrain from buying crafts for small children that take great concentration and detail.






Younger children should not be asked to complete projects that are physically demanding or make great use of fine motor skills, such as stringing small beads.

 It is possible to sterilize still water, but flowing water is usually much cleaner.
 Take a tightly woven piece of cloth such as a bandana or shirt and group the corners together, forming a bag. Scoop this bag through the water and position it over your water container. The cloth will act as a primitive filter, but will only filter out particles about the size of what you can see.
 Since you may not have tablets when you're lost boil the water to make it drinkable.
 Leave the water at a rolling boil for ten minutes.


Since your only water container will probably be your water bottle you'll have to unscrew the lid so it doesn't explode from the steam pressure.
You should also suspend the bottle so that its bottom is a few inches above the flames. Hopefully, this will keep the bottle from completely melting.

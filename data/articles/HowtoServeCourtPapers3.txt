 In most states, you can pay the court clerk a small fee to mail the court papers to the respondent via certified mail or first-class mail, depending on which service is required for the type of papers being served.


The fee you pay is usually low and can be recovered if you win the case.
In some states, like California, service by mail must be made through the court clerk and you will be unable to mail the papers yourself. Check on your own state laws regarding this type of service to determine what the restrictions are.
 In some states, like Michigan or Arizona, you might be permitted to send the papers to the respondent without going through a court clerk. If this happens, those papers should be mailed via certified or registered mail, and you must request a return receipt.That receipt must be signed by the respondent to the petition.
Note that certified mail is required when you are serving a paper that opens a case. If you are serving additional papers related to the case after that fact, you can usually opt for first-class mail.
 If you pay the court clerk to send the papers, he or she must fill out the form. You will likely receive a copy and the court clerk will keep the original for the case records. If you live in a state that permits you to mail the papers yourself, you will need to fill out the form and file it as usual.Note that you will also need to include a copy of the signed receipt of delivery when filing the form with the court.
 Even though service by mail can be convenient, there is some chance that the judge will not accept this method of service unless strict guidelines are followed. In fact, roughly 50 percent of court papers served by certified mail are rejected.The judge must be able to read the signature on the certified mail receipt. That signature must belong to the respondent and no one else.
If the respondent refuses to sign the certified mail receipt with his or her full name, that receipt cannot be accepted as proof of service.

 Although this may not be your style, it will help to get things out of your head and onto paper. You will be able to focus better if you know that you will not forget what you have to do today.
 Get to know your deadlines and complete the projects in order of deadlines. If you don’t do this, you will set yourself up for a stressful day at work—always in crisis trying to meet looming deadlines.
 If your to-do list is not something you can reasonably accomplish in a day, create a to-do list for the following day, so that you can reduce the load. When faced with too much work, you may become unmotivated knowing you can’t accomplish everything.Opt to have a five or seven day to-do list. Use a dry erase board or pencil, so that you can change it every morning before you begin. It will result in fewer things falling through the cracks.
 If you haven’t tried it before, schedule your day where you have two periods for answering emails, a period for calling and time for Internet use and several breaks. Calls, emails and texts can break up the flow of work on a project, resulting in distractions and procrastination.
 Your cell phone probably has an easy timer. Unless you like to work at something for more than a few hours, set an alarm at hour intervals to get up, move around and change tasks.
 Avoid checking your work email after this time. Most successful entrepreneurs are able to establish a work/life balance that includes relationships, hobbies and vacations.
 Return to a clean, uncluttered slate in the morning.

 Open the My Computer window by clicking on the desktop icon or navigating to the option in the Start menu. Under the heading "Network Drives," you should see an icon reading "Time Capsule." Double-click the icon, and choose "Connect with Password" in the dialog box that appears. Enter the password associated with your Time Capsule device and click the "OK" button.
 Plug the printer into the USB port on the Time Capsule drive using a USB cord. If your printer does not support USB connectivity, you won't be able to share it using Time Capsule.
 The CD included with Time Capsule includes an installation of Bonjour, which is Apple's service for detecting wireless devices. Insert the CD into your optical drive and follow the instructions that appear in the installation wizard to install Bonjour.
 In the Bonjour installation wizard, you will be prompted to choose any detected printers you wish to add. Choose your printer from the list and continue with the installation. You are now sharing the printer wirelessly.

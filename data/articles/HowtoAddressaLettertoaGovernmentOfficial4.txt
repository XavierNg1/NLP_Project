 Before you send the letter, consider whether this government official will be able to meaningfully act on your letter. Avoid asking for unrealistic things. Do not ask the government official to do more than his/her job allows. Take a step back and consider whether there is a better channel for your complaint.


Petitions and form letters are usually well-written and actionable. Make sure, however, that the demanded actions fall within the scope of this official's duties.
 Depending on rank, government officials may receive dozens to hundreds of letters each day. He or she may even employ professional letter-sorters to determine which select few messages actually wind up in the hands of the official. Make your letter polite, concise, and topical. In the first sentence or subject line, reference an issue that is at the top of the official's agenda.


Make sure that your letter is insightful and well-written. The letters that wind up at the top of the stack will be readable, relevant, and easy for the official to understand.
Identify your credentials. Briefly explain your qualifications, and tell the official why he or she should take note of your opinion. Perhaps you have a Ph.D, or you live in the town that's been in the news lately, or you have personally met the official at some point in the past.
 Is it necessary, or are you just venting? Send a request that is polite, concise, and realistic. Do not swear or drop insults. Respect begets respect.


Do not threaten a government official. The letter can be traced back to you. Beyond any risk, your threats will not necessarily inspire productive action.

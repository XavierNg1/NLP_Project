 If you weren’t able to get Victini during the event time, and you can’t find anyone to trade you one, you can use the Action Replay cheat program to hack the Pokémon game and allow you to catch a Victini. Add the following code to your AR code list:


94000130 FFFB0000
C0000000 0000002F
12250030 000001EE
DC000000 00000004
D2000000 00000000;
, Prepare to fight Victini in the wild. The Victini unlocked by the code can be a wide variety of levels, even 70+, so be sure that you Pokémon that can handle the fight. Stock up on Pokeballs so that you have enough strong Pokeballs to capture it.
 Once you see the light flash on your DS, the code has been activated. Walk into any tall grass, and in a moment you should be attacked by a wild Victini.
 In order to capture Victini, it will need to have a red health bar. Use regular attacks to take it down quickly, and then weak attacks to get the health bar into the red. Once Victini’s health is low, start trying to capture it with your Pokeballs. This may take several tries. Once you’ve captured it, it will be part of your Pokémon team.

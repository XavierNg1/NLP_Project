 The model number will determine the software that you can install during and after the hack. There are essentially two different processes that depend on the model.


For older PSPs, open the battery compartment. To the right of the Sony logo, you will see “PSP-XXXX.” All you will need to know is if it is a 1XXX, 2XXX, or 3XXX model.
For the PSP Go, you can find the model number by flipping open the display and looking in the upper left-hand corner. It should say N1XXX.
The ideal model is 2XXX or older model. 3XXX and the PSP Go can be hacked, but you will be slightly limited in what you can do.
 In order to start the hack, you will need to make sure your PSP is updated to version 6.60. You can either use the system update function, or download the file directly from the | Sony site.


If you download the update file from the Sony website, copy it to the PSP by connecting the PSP to your computer. Copy the file into the PSP/GAME/UPDATE/ folder and then run the update file from the PSP.
To copy files onto a PSP, you will need to put your PSP into USB mode. Once you connect a PSP to your computer, scroll to the left on your PSP’s menu until you reach the settings menu, and then scroll up to select USB mode. Your PSP will then become accessible as a storage device from your computer.
 You will need PRO-C, which can be found at multiple places on the internet. Extract the file and copy the firmware onto your PSP using USB mode, into the folder PSP/GAME/.

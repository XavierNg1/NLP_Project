 This will save you a great deal of time and trouble, and give you enough time to find another potential date if necessary.


If you are unsure, then ask one of his friends or someone in his social circle. Try to figure this out before asking him out.
If he has a girlfriend, then he is probably going with her.;
, In the event that your first choice is taken, having backup will ensure that you are not left without a date to the dance.
 Consider asking him in person or via telephone if you have his number. It is also totally acceptable to ask him through email or Facebook message if you don't want to do it face-to-face.
 If you are doing the asking in person, then approach him and say hello.


Be sure to smile and act confident, even if you are extremely nervous. Most guys like girls who are confident and have self-esteem. (Don't act pompous or cocky, though).
Wear something that makes you feel attractive. If you feel beautiful on the inside, then it will show on the outside.
 Ask him whether or not he is going, and if he has made any plans.


If he already has another date, then don't ask him to ditch his current date to go with you. It is unfair to the other girl, and will come across as desperate and insensitive.
 Be sure to smile and look him in the eyes if you are doing the asking in person.


Share your current plans with him, if you have any. For example, if you and your girlfriends have rented a limousine, then tell him. This will help him make his decision, and show him that you have a fun evening planned.
 If he says yes, then tell him you are looking forward to it, but don't jump up and down screaming; you don't want to make him regret his decision! If he says no, then graciously tell him that there are no hard feelings, and move on.
 Decide who will pick up whom, where you will meet, and what color dress you are wearing if it is a formal dance so that he can determine what color to wear.

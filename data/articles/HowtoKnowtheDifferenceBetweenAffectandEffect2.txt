 “Effect” means a change that has been brought about by something else. It comes from a Latin word meaning “to bring about.”

, Usually, “effect” is used as a noun. Therefore, it will often be paired with an article, such as “an” or “the.”

, Consider something that would cause something else to happen. Maybe the cat changed something on the table or the rain changed the water levels, like in the previous example. Sentences that use “effect” properly include:


“The cat’s leaping had a noticeable effect on the glassware on the table.”
“The rain’s effect was noticeable, as the lake’s water levels had risen.”

, Though “effect” can be used as a verb, it has a direct object in the sentence. A direct object is something that follows the verb that answers the question “how” or “what,” such as “I paint houses.” “Houses” is the direct object.


When “effect” is used as a verb, it always takes a direct object. In this case, “effect” means “to cause something to happen.” A sentence would be, “Our new boss has effected some positive changes”

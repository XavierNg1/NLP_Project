 Tell your partner that you would really appreciate it if they could tell your in-laws not to drop by unannounced. Also, you should remind them to communicate how much you appreciate their role in your lives. You could try asking:“Do you mind asking your folks if they could give a ring before stopping by?”
“Can you talk to your parents about their constant visits?”

, If your spouse is comfortable with the idea, you could also directly communicate your needs to your in-laws. Say that the two of you have made a decision to ask all family members to call before visiting. By framing it as a general rule, they may be less likely to get offended. Try saying:“We have made a decision, as a couple, to ask all friends and family members to call before visiting.”

, If your in-laws continue to drop by unannounced after you tell them about your need for privacy, you may need to use more straightforward language. When they drop by, tell them that you are actually busy and don’t have time for them at the moment. Eventually, they should get the message that they need to call before visiting. You might say:"Sorry you came all this way. I'm not sure if you remember, but we're actually busy right now. You really should have called before coming all this way."
"Sorry, we're actually in the middle of something right now. If you give us a ring later in the week, we can make plans for a better day that works for both of us."
"Thanks for coming but we're actually busy right now. I hear there's a great new restaurant on Main Street, why don't you check that out. Call us later in the week and we'll set up a time for dinner soon?"

 The float is a saucer-shaped device on the bottom of the tub. Under the float, on the bottom of the dishwasher, is the float switch that controls the water level. Change the switch to the higher position to change the float height and lower the water level in the dishwasher., When a faulty or damaged water inlet valve is the cause of the leak, you can fix the leak by replacing the inlet valve. To remove the old valve, you'll remove the hoses, take out the screws, and remove the spring clamp. You can then replace it with a new water inlet valve., To replace a broken or torn hose, release the clamps holding the hose in place. Replace the old hose with a new one, and reattach the clamps. Or, if the problem is a loose clamp, simply tighten the clamp where the connection was leaking.

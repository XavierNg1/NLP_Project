Sales that don't go smoothly are called "defects" by eBay, and are categorized as such on your seller dashboard. These problems are tracked in your transaction defect rate, which is the percentage of your sales that had defects.Every Wednesday, eBay reviews defects and automatically removes those that meet the requirements outlined in the company's feedback policy.Feedback that qualifies for automatic removal includes problems that happened as a direct result of an eBay site issue or error, or transactions for which the buyer initiated a PayPal Purchase Protection case or an eBay Money Back Guarantee request and the case was decided in the seller's favor.If a comment violates eBay policies, such as including profanity or links, the comment itself may be removed, but the rating or any related information will not be removed., Once you've decided the type of defect, request that eBay remove it.

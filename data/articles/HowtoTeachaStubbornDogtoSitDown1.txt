 When you have some free time, grab a small treat and follow your dog around for a few minutes. Don't try to attract his attention or play with him. You just want to watch him while he does whatever he would be doing anyway.;
, Keep a careful eye on your dog without disturbing him. As soon as you notice him get into the "sit" position on his own, praise him and give him a small chunk of the treat. Tell him "sit" or "sit down" in a commanding voice (but not a harsh one). After this, leave the dog alone, but continue to watch him.


You want to come across as affectionate here, not startling. Speak loudly enough to get your dog's attention, but not loudly enough to shock him out of his sitting position.
 Continue to watch your dog. As soon as he sits again, offer him another piece of the treat, praise him, and give the "sit" command. Repeat this process each time your dog sits on his own.


Use short practice sessions — 5-10 minutes should be long enough. Don't continue for longer, otherwise he will associate "Sit" (and treats) with boredom. Repeat this every day for a week.
 Over time, the dog will start to associate the sitting position with receiving praise and treats. After about a week of practice, try getting your dog's attention and giving the "sit" command. If he responds correctly, praise him and give him a piece of a treat. Now, you can start practicing the command itself.


If your dog hasn't learned the command yet, keep practicing. Some dogs take longer than others to learn new tricks.

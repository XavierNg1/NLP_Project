 Your tractor will also need to be able to bear the weight of the plough blade on its frame. Don’t attempt the conversion unless you are sure it can handle it.


Rather than risk converting the mower yourself, consider purchasing one that already has a snow plough attachment available from the manufacturer. John Deere tractors offer this as an option.;
, You’re advised to get your tractor serviced before you begin. Check the frame carefully for rust. Rust will weaken the structure, making it less likely that it will be able to bear the weight of a snow plough blade at the front while also being able to push snow out of the way.
 Remember also that garden tractor tires aren’t usually intended for use on snow. You might like to consider fitting snow chains to the tires in addition to converting the front fitting.


Wheel weights may also help rebalance the vehicle.
 Not all ride-on tractor mowers will be suitable for turning into a snow plough. Some cheap models won’t be heavy or sturdy enough or have enough horsepower to push deep snow out of the way.

 Having good posture is the key to taking accurate measurements.;
, Take it around your back, across your shoulder blades and under your arms. It should wrap around the fullest part of your bust. The tape should be straight and parallel with the floor.
 Place your thumb beneath the tape measure and keep yourself from pulling too tight, as this could give you an incorrect measurement. Record the measurement. Use a pencil and paper to record the measurement.
 Wrap it so that it rests just under your bust, where your bra band would sit. Record the measurement.
 To figure out your bra size, take your bust and under bust (band) measurements while wearing a bra. Round up your bust size to the nearest whole number, and subtract your band size from your rounded-up bust size. For instance, if you have a 36 inch (91.4 cm) bust, and a 34 inch (86.4 cm) band size, that leaves you with a difference of two inches. Add approximately one cup size for every inch difference.


A difference of one leaves you with an A cup, while a difference of two equals a B cup, three equals a C cup, four equals a D cup, and so on.

, Some tips are to make then the same type of species. Examples: Cats, Dogs, Horses, etc.
 What will make it even more fun is that you can make miniature objects that are in YOUR school, such as folders, papers, etc (American Girl Doll has a great school kit that will help you get started!)

, Webkinz Summer Camps are a great activity to fill up your summers! Boxes can be used for buildings and you can find Webkinz bunk beds on Youtube if you want to go to the extreme.
 Hospitals, W shops, parks, banks, police departments, fire departments, restaurants, and so much more can be built! And of course, you must have police cars and fire trucks! Regular cars and airplanes can be made out of cardboard boxes and painted to look like the real thing. Also for the restaurants, try making bowls and tables. You can use Japanese erasers for the food, and try to make the restaurant have a theme such as cowboy or jazz.
 Carnivals should come every so often, these are very fun to make, so try to make it as fun as possible for the Webkinz! Also, since you are having police, firemen, and doctors, have your Webkinz become ill, be robbed, or their house catches on fire. This way these jobs won't be useless! Clothes for the Webkinz can be made out of socks (or cloth if you're good at sewing).
 Pick your favorite Webkinz and a teacher then let your mind loose and pretend there is a teacher, try to teach the Webkinz what you learn in school that way you will be learning everything all over again!

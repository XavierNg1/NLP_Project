 There are several different circumstances that can place you at risk of contracting HIV. If you've experienced one of the following situations, you are at risk:


You've had unprotected anal, vaginal, or oral sex.
You've shared needles or syringes.
You've been diagnosed or treated for a sexually transmitted disease (STD), tuberculosis, or hepatitis.
You received a blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985, the years before safety precautions were in place to prevent tainted blood from being used in transfusions.
 Many people HIV don't know they have it. The virus can be carried in your body for over ten years before symptoms begin to occur. If you have reason to think you may have contracted HIV, don't let a lack of symptoms stop you from getting tested. It's best to know as soon as possible.
 This is the most accurate measure in determining if you have HIV. Contact a local health clinic, the red cross, your doctor's office, or another local resource to find out where to get tested. Go to the website aids.gov for a listing of testing locations.


Testing is easy, affordable, and reliable (in the majority of cases). The most common test is done through drawing a blood sample. There are also tests that use oral fluids (not saliva) and urine. There are even tests you can take at home. If you do not have a regular physician who can provide testing, contact your local Health Department.
If you are tested for HIV, do not let fear prevent you from obtaining your test results. Knowing if you are infected, or not, brings about change in your lifestyle and your way of thinking.

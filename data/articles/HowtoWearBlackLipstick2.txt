 Black lipstick makes a big statement, and you don't want to distract from that by wearing too much other makeup. Create a clean palette by using a neutral foundation the exact color of your skin. Use just the barest hint of blush, bronzer and other face color so as not to overwhelm your black lipstick.
 Completely bare eyes might look too naked in contrast to your lips. While you don't want to go overboard with eye makeup, using black liner and mascara adds a nice touch. Try a light cat-eye look, or simply rim your top and bottom lids with a sleep of eyeliner.


Use black eyeliner to match your black lipstick. Using a different color could cause your face to look to busy.
Avoid piling on the liner or doing a smokey-eye look. This could take your face from looking striking to overly goth.
 Using a hint of color will brighten your face and keep your look from getting too dismal. Apply a light layer of jewel-toned eyeshadow to your lids, brushing the color out toward the corners of your eyes. If you're feeling daring, sweep a little color under your eyes as well.
 If you love a dark lip but don't want to wear jet black, there are still plenty of options that will cause heads to turn. Dark purples, reds and browns are a little easier to pull off than full-on black. All dark lipsticks should be applied with the same care as black, since streaking and flaking will show up more easily than with lighter shades.Don't forget to exfoliate and moisturize your lips first.
Use lipliner a shade darker than your lip color.
Apply two layers of color, then top with gloss if you'd like.
 If you want to add another gorgeous dimension to your black lipstick, try topping it with a layer of clear shimmery gloss. Your lips will sparkle under the low lights at the club or bar where you'll be hanging out. Since this look can take on a costume makeup appearance, save it for special occasions that call for getting dressed up in style.

 Look for the Facebook app on your Android device. It’s the one with the app icon with the Facebook logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 Tap on the More tab from the toolbar at the top. Its the one with three horizontal bars.


Scroll down until you see the “Help & Settings” section.
 Tap “Account Settings” from this section, and scroll down until you see “Apps.” Tap on it, and you will be brought to the “Apps and Websites” screen. This screen lists all the apps connected with your Facebook account.
 Scroll down until you see Candy Crush Soda Saga. Tap on it, and you will be brought to the app’s settings.
 Tap the “Posts on your behalf to” option, and select “Only Me.” Now whenever Candy Crush Soda Saga posts to your wall, only you will be able to see it.

 If you chug too much water, too fast, you can give yourself an electrolyte imbalance: your kidneys cannot flush the amount of water you've consumed, and your blood becomes waterlogged. This extra water can swell your brain cells, causing your brain to expand dangerously against the skull. Rapid and severe cellular swelling can cause seizures, respiratory arrest, coma, brain stem herniation, and even death.It's estimated that consuming more than 1.5 liters/hour over several hours can greatly increase your risk of hyponatremia., The risk of hyponatremia is especially high if you have been steadily exerting yourself over a long period of time – and even more so if you are performing in a hot environment. You lose sodium (an electrolyte) through sweat. Thus, drinking too much water to re-hydrate during endurance activities—such as marathons and triathlons—can dilute the sodium content of your blood.
 If you consume too much liquid at once, you can choke on it., as water spills into your airways. If you flood your stomach with more water than it can handle, you may involuntarily puke out the excess water.Make sure that there is no ice in the water. It is quite possible to choke to death on a chunk of ice.
 If you are trying to chug water for health and hydration benefits, keep in mind that chugging is no more efficient than sipping water. What's more, chugging can potentially counteract the positive effects of drinking water.If you are chugging water for a competition: remember the risks, and think before you chug. Ask yourself whether winning this chugging contest is worth any potential damage to your body.

 Instead of redoing your entire wardrobe in one weekend, slowly introduce one or two new pieces with each shopping trip. Doing so will be easier on both your budget and your patience.
 Stock up on denim jeans, button-down shirts, fitted t-shirts, dress trousers, basic skirts, and any other wardrobe essential you can think of. Look for neutral colors like white, black, gray, brown, and beige. While these pieces look bland on their own, you can easily build on them to create fun, fashionable outfits.
 Fads change every season, and if you stock up on too many, you may find yourself needing to clear out your wardrobe again by next year.
 Updating your accessory wardrobe often proves easier and less costly than updating your clothes. Accessories can also be a lot of fun to pick out and match together. Look for jewelry, hats, scarves, belts, purses, and shoes. Never buy more than you could ever use, but do not shy away from variety, either.

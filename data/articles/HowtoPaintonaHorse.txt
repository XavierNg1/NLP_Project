 Grab all the washable, non-toxic colors of paint you want, such as tempera paint, watercolors, or face paint. Put on glitter on other accessories once your horse is painted and dry.;
,, Use your large paint brushes and set all the paint up and make sure they're washable and not dry, also make sure they are animal safe to use on their fur/skin.
 Dab your paintbrush in the paint and start painting away!

,,, Use a scrub brush and your fingernails for the tougher parts. Don't freak if the fur is stained or some paint remains- it might be a while for it to completely fade.


Clip away parts of the stained fur if absolutely necessary.
 If inside, gather all the glitter and sweep with a broom to tidy the place up.
 Make sure you have cleaned everything up and then you're done!

 If the reason you want to avoid getting called on in class is because you are nervous to talk in front of other people, you might have a speaking anxiety. You can overcome this by being prepared for class and feeling confident and positive.


Start your answers strong and don’t mumble.
Practice speaking in front of smaller groups and then work your way up to talking in class., If you pay attention and concentrate, you will feel a lot more comfortable answering questions in class. When the teacher talks, actively listen and try to process what is being said. Take notes while the teacher talks and sit in the front of the class.Don’t be on your phone during class. It will distract you and stop you from paying attention.
 If you come to class unprepared, you won’t know the answer to any questions. Do any homework assignments before class so you are prepared for any questions that the teacher might ask. If you feel confident, you won’t have to worry about avoiding the teacher and you will have a better experience in class.

 Baby teeth loosen gradually, and often take two or more weeks to loosen enough to be removed from your child’s mouth. Although children are often excited to lose their baby teeth, it can be painful if the tooth is not sufficiently loose. Inspect your child’s tooth, and see if it’s ready to come out. If the tooth is only connected by a small flap of gum tissue, encourage your child to loosen it further until the tooth falls out.The root of a baby tooth is slowly resorbed by the growth of the permanent tooth underneath. If this process is not complete, pulling out the tooth can cause pain and bleeding.
Unless a tooth is extremely loose (literally hanging by a thread), avoid yanking it out of your child’s mouth.Yanking a tooth can be painful for your child, and can damage their gum tissue.;
, Most kids help their teeth fall out this way, by painlessly rocking the teeth back and forth with their fingers.Encourage your child to use these tactics to work loose teeth on their own, which most kids are happy to do.


It’s also important to remind your children that this process takes time. If a tooth is too tight to fall out, let them know that it may be several days before the tooth comes out on its own.
 As parents, it can be tempting to pull your kids’ loose teeth for them. However, it’s better to let your children wiggle and loosen their own teeth themselves. Often the loose teeth will come out on their own after being incessantly handled by the child.


Rather than needlessly pulling on your child’s tooth, let them loosen it over time. Your child will be able to gauge their own pain (or lack thereof) and can tell when and if the tooth is being pulled on too hard.Have your child wash their hands first to help prevent infection from any dirt or bacteria on their hands.

 A red Santa hat, a red jacket with some white fur on it, a black belt, red pants with white fur on the bottoms, and a pair of black boots is great. If you do not already have a long, white beard, do not forget it. Buy one that is as realistic as possible.;
, He is always smiling, so you should never be frowning. Smile, laugh, and "ho ho ho" as much as possible. Some people feel self-conscious about acting so jolly, but if you have a great costume on, people will not know it is you anyhow. Also be sure to speak in a deep, jolly voice to sound like Santa.
 If they are sitting on your lap, make sure to ask them what they want for Christmas. Give them a hug or a high five. You can also give a thumbs up. Children love that stuff. Some will present the problem of saying, "You're not the real Santa." You can deal with this problem 1 of 2 ways.
 I'm just a stand-in. The real Santa is busy making toys for all you boys and girls in his workshop in the North Pole, so he asked me to come down and visit you." This works pretty well, especially if you have a fake beard because sometimes, that occasional bratty child will try to rip off your fake beard to prove you are not Santa., Tell the child, "Of course I'm the real Santa! Ho ho ho!" and give him a candy cane so he won't say anything else that could blow your cover., It is the number one rule of being a good Santa. Santa loves children!

, If you are having children sit on your lap or take a picture with you, give them a candy cane from your sack after each child tells you what they want for Christmas and / or take a picture with you. The children love it. If you are at an adult Christmas party, bounce around happily and give candy canes to random adults. Add a "Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!" In there, and you will most likely make them smile.

 One of the most common migraine triggers is food. The exact foods that trigger migraines vary from person to person, but there are some food triggers most migraine-sufferers have in common. Tracking what food you eat and when you get a migraine can help you narrow down which foods might be triggers for you. Common migraine triggers are:Chocolate
Wine and cheese (because of the sulfates in both)
Food with monosodium glutamate (MSG) in it.
Artificial sweeteners like aspartame.
Processed foods (which usually contain nitrates).;
, Migraines can also be triggered by things like smells, lights, noises, and even the weather. If you notice you’re getting migraines pretty regularly, track what sort of environmental triggers are happening at the same time. When you're tracking your migraines, ask yourself a few questions: Do you recall always smelling the same thing before your migraine? Do you spend a lot of time under fluorescent lights? This can help you figure out environmental triggers.
 Caffeine can cause migraines if you experience caffeine withdrawal. This is most likely if you regularly drink more than the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day. Tracking your caffeine intake can show you if you have migraines on days when you don’t drink as much caffeine as you usually do., Changes in certain hormone levels – particularly estrogen – can cause migraines, especially in women. Track when you get your migraines and how this lines up with your body's hormonal changes to see if you have hormonal triggers.Women who are on birth control pills might experience migraines because of the hormonal changes the pill can cause. Some women may experience migraines shortly before their periods begin, when their estrogen levels drop.

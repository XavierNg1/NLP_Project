 Slice the avocados in half around the pit, then use the knife to scoop around the pit and separate the avocado halves. Spoon out the fruit of the twelve avocados and place it in a food processor., Once you have scooped out the fruit of the twelve avocados into the food processor, puree the avocados until you are left with a thick paste.You can also hand mash the avocados if you don’t have a food processor.
 Spoon out the mashed avocado onto a baking tray, then use a spatula to spread the avocado out into as thin a layer as you can. Try to make the layer about half an inch (1.3 centimeters) thick.
 After you have spread the avocado out into a thin layer, place the tray into the oven. You don’t need to preheat it, but be sure not to set the temperature to more than 155 degrees F (50 degrees C). You are trying to dry the avocado out, not bake it.You can also put the tray of avocado outside to dry in the sun for about two days.
 Let the avocado dry out in the oven for around five hours. Check every hour or so to make sure the avocado isn’t burning. It should be a dark-brownish green; if is turning black, take it out of the oven., After five hours are up, take the baking pan out of the oven. Use a spatula to work against the avocado layer and scratch it off of the pan. Place the avocado scraps into a thin cotton cloth or a square of gauze., Lift up the cloth with the avocado and pinch the corners together so you make a sack of sorts. With as much force as you can, squeeze the dried avocado into a bowl. Readjust your grip as you are squeezing to make sure that you have squeezed all of the avocado. Stop when the avocado stops yielding oil., When you have squeezed all of the avocado oil into the bowl, dispose of the cloth and the dried avocado. Then pour the avocado oil into a bottle and seal it.

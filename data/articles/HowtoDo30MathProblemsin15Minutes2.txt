 You most likely answered the problems you were confident about correctly. If you have a strict time-budget, don’t bother checking your work on these problems. You might end up wasting time by second-guessing yourself.
 For the more difficult problems, go back and make an estimate about what the answer should be, then check the estimate against your solution. Doing this can help you quickly identify unreasonable answers.If your answer seems reasonable based on your estimate, don’t bother re-checking your work. Only re-check work that does not align with your estimate.
 If you complete your assignment adequately, choose a reward that is motivating to you. This can be social media time, ice cream, a TV show, or anything else you enjoy. Rewarding yourself is an important step, as it will help keep you motivated to focus and work efficiently in the future.Only reward yourself if you were focused, and if you completed your work accurately. Don’t reward yourself if you crammed too much work into 15 minutes and did not do an accurate job on your homework.

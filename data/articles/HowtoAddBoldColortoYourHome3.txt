 In addition to accent décor, you can add some bold color to your walls. While you may choose to paint an entire room one color, you may also decide to paint a single accent wall with neutral tones throughout the rest of the room. You might also decide to paint your:


Ceiling
Windowsills
Door frames
Alcove or niche, Visit a local hardware or paint store, and pick up a roll of color sample cards. These are colored cardboard that represent the color as it will appear when painted. Take these home, and hold them up to your wall to see how the color appears in the room’s lighting.
 Purchase a small can of test paint, and apply it to a small area in the room of choice. This will allow you to see how the paint appears on your wall before you commit. Wait several days so that you can decide if you like the color.If you are undecided on the color, you can paint multiple test patches next to one another.
 Before you start priming or painting the wall, you should wipe it down first. Use a rag soaked in warm, soapy water, and gently brush it over the wall. Remove any dirt or stains. Let it dry completely before applying primer.
 Tape the edges, moldings, and hardware (like electrical sockets and light switches), and lay a tarp on the ground. Open the can of primer, and stir it with a brush. Using a paintbrush, add a coat of the primer to the walls. This will give your paint job a smooth, professional appearance.Wait for the primer to dry completely before applying paint. This could be several hours or overnight.
 To begin painting, run a paintbrush along the edges of the wall carefully, so that tape does not bleed over the tape. Fill in the middle with a paint roller. Wait until the wall is dry to the touch before applying a second coat. This could be six to eight hours or overnight.Use a wide, straight-edged brush to paint trim, moldings, window sills, and door frames.

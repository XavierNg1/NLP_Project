 Move closer to your wifi -- like, move right next to it -- and see if that fixes the problem.


If the wifi signal is the problem, you may want to move your wifi router to somewhere else in your house that is more centrally located.

Check if there is something that could be interfering with your wifi. If there is a baby monitor, microwave oven, remote control etc next to the wifi, you may do better moving it.;

If you have two other people in your house downloading massive files or gaming using the same connection as you, see what happens if you ask them to turn off their device for a moment.

If you have too many people using your connection, look into getting a faster internet service.



You also may find someone outside your home or office is using your wireless signal.
 Direct connection should be 20-30% faster than wifi.
 There are free services like speedtest.net which will tell you what speed you are getting today, and you can see if you are getting what your ISP has told you you are getting.


Be careful not to click on any ads on services like speedtest, they often have expensive unproven methods.

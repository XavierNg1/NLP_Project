 Warmth or heat helps to relax the contracting muscles of your uterus and other sore places. Athletes usually take hot showers right after they exercise to help soothe their muscles and prevent soreness the days following.


For some people, being in water helps to slow the flow of their periods, making it possible to stay in the tub, blood-free. In a tub, the water acts to push against your vagina and slow down the flow. However, if you sit long enough, you'll most likely see blood flow out.
 Similar to a hot bath and shower, heat helps to relax muscles and encourage increased blood flow to reduce pain. Use a hot water bottle or heating pad on your stomach for about 15 minutes.


You can also try using heating patches if you're on the move. Follow the instructions of the heating patches carefully to prevent burns or putting it on irritated or damaged skin.
 Hot water and tea is often recommended to people with cramps to help relieve abdominal pain. The warmth from your hot drink helps to loose muscles and increase blood flow in your body.


Avoid drinks with a high sugar content which may increase bloating and make your cramps worse.

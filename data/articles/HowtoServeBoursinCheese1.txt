 Boursin cheese is soft and creamy, so don’t expect to serve it as you would with, say, hard cheddar, which you can cut into firm cubes and serve with toothpicks for handholds. Provide a knife or spoon so guests can spread it on other snacks. Also be sure that you transfer it, if needed, to a hard serving plate or bowl if it’s wrapped in foil, since a knife could potentially slice the foil.;
, Stick with the classic platter snacks if you’re a traditionalist. Arrange slices of bread and/or assorted crackers around your cheese. If fruits and vegetables are more your thing, do the same with them, or offer both. However, if you do both, keep the fruits and veggies separated from the bread and crackers, since the moisture from one could soften the other., Boursin is very versatile when it comes to being paired with other foods. Surprise your guests with more than the same-old same-old. Instead of (or in addition to) the crackers and veggies, consider offering dry cured meats, olives, jam, honey, and/or chocolate.

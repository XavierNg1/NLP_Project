Mark the angles to make the peak (ridge). Dogleg that from the sidewalls, the bottom angle where the truss sits on the loft or 2nd floor joist. Another rafter will fit between the doglegs to provide extra support.










 


The peak of the gambrel roof normally is 30 degrees with the doglegs 60 degrees. However, they can be whatever fits your purpose.













Use these pieces as a pattern to mark and cut the rest of the gambrel roof trusses. Cut enough pieces for trusses to be installed on 16-inch centers. Use .5-inch (12 mm) plywood to make brackets for securing the pieces together. Cardboard pieces drawn and cut to size make excellent patterns for the straps.

Nail the straps at the joints on both sides of the trusses with 6 penny nails.

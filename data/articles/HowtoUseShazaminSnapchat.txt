 Make sure you're running the latest available version so that you have access to the latest features like Snapchat integration. You can check for updates on the App Store (iPhone) or Play Store (Android).


The process for using Shazam is the same for both apps.;
, Tap the circle button at the bottom of the Snapchat screen if you're on the Chat or Stories window. This will open the Camera screen.
 Shazam works best when there is minimal background noise and the song can be heard clearly.
 For best results, do this when your face isn't on the screen, as you may accidentally trigger the Lenses feature.


You must do this before taking a Snap.
 You'll see two incomplete circles rotate on the screen as Shazam scans the music that is playing. It may take a few moments for Shazam to recognize the song. When Shazam identifies the song, your phone will vibrate.
 This will open the Song in a miniature version of the Shazam app, allowing you to listen or purchase the song.
 This will allow you to make a Snap of the artist's Shazam screen, which you can then draw on and add filters like a regular Snap. The recipients will be able to tap the Listen button and listen to the song.

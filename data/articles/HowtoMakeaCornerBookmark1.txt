 If you don't have any origami paper, cut a 6 by 6-inch (15.24 by 15.24 centimeters) square out of thin paper, such as gift wrap, printer paper, or construction paper. Do not use cardstock; it is too thick for this project.;
, Take one of the corners, and fold it towards the opposite corner. Run your fingernail along the crease to make it nice and sharp.
 The straight, folded edge should be facing you. The point tip should be facing away from you.
 You'll notice that your triangle has two layers of paper. You are only folding one of those layers. When you are done folding, your paper should still be shaped like a triangle, but with a smaller, upside-down triangle inside it. This will create a "pocket" for your bookmark.
 Take the left bottom corner, and fold it towards the top of the triangle. Make sure that the edges align, then run your fingernail along the crease to sharpen it. Repeat this step for the other side. You will end up with a diamond shape.
 Take the first corner you just folded, and fold it half-way inside the triangle. Be sure to tuck it under the "pocket." Repeat this step for the other corner., You can decorate it with stickers, or even draw a face on it to make it look lime a monster chomping down on the corner of your page.
 If you just used stickers to decorate your bookmark, then you are good to go. If you used pens or markers to decorate it, however, you might want to let it dry a little so that the wet ink doesn't transfer onto your book.

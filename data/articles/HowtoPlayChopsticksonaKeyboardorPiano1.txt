 Obviously you need the instrument in order to learn how to play it. However, if you want to practice you can draw out piano keys on a piece of paper and play that.;
, If you’re having trouble remembering what note is which it might help to put little circular stickers on each key. You can write the note of each key inside the sticker. Make sure you don’t damage your keyboard! Don’t write on the keyboards.


Place the stickers on the notes that you are going to play for this song.
 You can find the sheet music for chopsticks many places online. You’ll want to be able to refer to the sheet music as you play while you are learning. Once you memorize it you can get rid of the sheet music. You don't have to do this, but it will help you have something to refer to. If you can't read music you can just write down the notes to play on a piece of paper.
 You’re not going to be able to play it perfectly immediately, so go into it with that knowledge. It will be a fun experience but you’ll have to practice and work at it. Don’t get frustrated! This is part of the joy of learning.

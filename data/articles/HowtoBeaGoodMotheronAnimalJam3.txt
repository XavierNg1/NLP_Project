 This is Animal Jam's official adoption center, claimed by real Jammers. Although some people may have adoptions in their dens, you cannot find many children in den adoption centers.


It's recommended that you go into a full world, where the Pillow Room will most likely be jammed with children, but a full world might be too crowded in the pillow room and you can't find anyone.
 State the preferred age and whether you would want a toddler, baby, or teenager. All mothers know what a perfect child looks like.
 By watching a child for a few minutes, you usually can tell what kind of child they would be, based on what they say and how they act.
 Smile at them, pick them up, give them toys, etc. Watch their reactions closely, especially when they're around other people.


If they answer rudely or don't use their manners, it's not recommended that you adopt them.
 Tell him or her, "I adopt you, sweetie pie!". Act quickly because you'll most likely have competition from other Jammers who would want that child.
 Show your child his or her room, and list a few rules that he or she needs to follow. However, make sure that there is plenty of freedom. No one likes a bossy mother.

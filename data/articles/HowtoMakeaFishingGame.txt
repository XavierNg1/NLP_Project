, It should be a reasonable size and simple. Cut out the template.
 Draw at least 10 fish, or more if you'd like a larger game.
 Lay on newspaper over the work surface, ready to add designs.
 Draw the designs in crayon first, then paint over them. Be sure to include the fish eye and scales. The wax designs will shine through the paint. Allow to dry.


Repeat for each fish.
 If it seems to slide off too easily, tape in place.


Repeat for each fish.


Tie a length of string to one end of the rod or stick and wind around it a little onto the stick for strength. The length of the string should be around 60cm (24") but test to adjust length as you see fit.






Tie another knot after winding, then either tape around this or glue to ensure it stays in place.






Tie the magnet onto the other end of the string.
 This step isn't essential but looks nice. If you don't want to make a pond, the fish can simply be scattered across the floor. To make a pond, cut out a pond shape from paper and paint it blue (or use blue paper). Alternatively, recycle the lid off a cardboard box and turn it into a fish pond, painting it blue.


Unwanted large bowls or containers can also serve as "ponds".
 The object of the game can be to get as many fish as possible in a set time or to simply have fun. The competitiveness of it depends on the children's ages. Toss the fish onto or into the pond area and have each child take turns to catch the fish. You can make up your own rules as to how much time each player has and what constitutes winning, if at all.


For older children, different colors or adding numbers to the fish during the design process can make the game more challenging. For example, children could try to catch fish with the highest numbers or the first person to get all the blue fish, etc.

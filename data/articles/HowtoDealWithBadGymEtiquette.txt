 By addressing them directly, you become a human who actually has a personality. It is much harder to ignore or disrespect someone who you have spoken to and got to know.
 Don't make it an attack. Be respectful and polite, but not apologetic. Make sure they don't alienate themselves from you because of an aggressive manner, or because they think you'll be a pushover. Give a specific example of how their behavior affects others., If the person then tries to tell you that you're being a 'sissy' or similar insult, ignore that. They're trying to shame you into backing down. Reinforce that you will not., Don't exaggerate, state it as you see it. Exaggeration will actually weaken your case, whereas being objective and practical strengthens your position., If the staff are not willing to help the clients, it's not at the standard you should demand.

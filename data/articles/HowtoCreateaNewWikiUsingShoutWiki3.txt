 It has some handy suggestions for building your wiki, and the customer support staff provide some different ways to contact them if you need help.
 It includes boxes where you can put your wiki's news, featured articles (if you want), and a description of your site. You will also see an "ABOUT THIS SITE" header.


Feel free to edit the main page and put whatever you want there, if you want to change its display.
 A wiki without these sorts of guidelines might be misused, and editors could wonder what to do.


Try creating some standards on the noteworthiness of articles, including how they should be formatted, and how research should be done. You might also want to include standards on weaving the web of links.
 The help pages are the pages that other editors and just regular visitors look at, if they are stuck or have a question.


Try adding information on concepts such as how to contribute, and guidelines for new contributors.
Create a FAQ page for the answers to questions that are asked frequently (or you assume the community as a whole will ask frequently).
 If you want to customize your interface, just click on any message. Click the "Edit" button to the right of that message, and edit where needed.


Feel free to edit the whole message if you want to.
Be careful. Editing an interface message will change the user interface for all users. That being said, don't do things like changing the "Edit" button to "Blah," because other editors probably won't know how that button functions.
 A wiki needs content so that other users have something to edit when they become a part of the community.


Create the articles. Be sure to follow the article noteworthiness standards yourself when doing this, or you'll be breaking your own rule.
Find freely licensed images to upload; images might represent articles, be the background on your main page, or something else. Flickr and Wikimedia Commons are good sources for freely licensed photos.

 Pain medications, such as OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, naproxen, or COX-2 inhibitors, can help with sciatica pain. Your doctor may write a prescription for stronger NSAIDs if the pain is more severe.
 Steroid injections are placed directly into the epidural space of the spinal cord. The steroids reduce inflammation.


Oral steroids are also used to reduce inflammation.
 Spinal surgery is generally reserved for severe pain that lasts for more than four to six weeks or persistent pain despite medication or other treatments. This is pain that is severely limiting the patientâ€™s life.Obviously, you will need to consult with a doctor to move toward this treatment of your sciatica.

 If it has a lot of dried ink in between the characters or lines, it is harder to read the printed image. If you are unsure just by looking at the stamp, do a test stamp on a piece of scrap paper, then check the document imprint.


Dried ink that is flat and clean on the stamp is a color stain, not a dirty stamp. It is only if the ink has built up and interferes with your stamping that it's a real problem.
, Hold the stamp by the handle. Run the rubber image under the water until the water runs clear. It's okay to see black, red, or another color of ink while rinsing the stamp.
 Use a paper towel to dry it completely.


Clean the sink after this, to remove any ink stains.

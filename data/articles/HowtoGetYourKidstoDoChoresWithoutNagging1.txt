 You may think your child knows exactly what is expected, but that may not actually be the case. Giving clear and detailed instructions of what you want can prevent you from feeling frustrated when your child doesn’t perform the task in the manner in which you desire.For instance, if you want your child’s room cleaned, avoid saying “Clean your room!” Instead, say “You need to put away your clean clothes, pick up all toys and trash from the floor, and make your bed.”;
, Just about everyone performs better—and has a more enjoyable time doing their chores—when they aren’t stressed, and are instead happy. Using humor to remind your children that they need to perform chores can set the tone for a good day, and have chores completed without fighting.


For example, you can write a note from the dog reminding your child that she is hungry and needs food., Children typically don’t want to hear long lectures whenever they forget to do something. Instead, create straightforward, one-word reminders that can help them to remember their chores when they forget.


For instance, saying “cat” to feed the cat or “homework” to remind them to complete their assignments may be enough to encourage your children to do their chores without causing a fight., Leading by example is one of the most effective methods in teaching children. Your children will likely procrastinate or dislike completing chores if they see you act the same way. Instead, get your own chores done in a timely manner, and display the type of attitude and performance you expect your children to display, yourself.

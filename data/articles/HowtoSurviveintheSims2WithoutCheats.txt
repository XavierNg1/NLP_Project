Now the family should be loading up, ready to play.



Your family is probably looking at the shower or cooker, or whatever is in the house at the moment.








You need to make all of your Sims walk into the middle of the road and make them stay there, or move them somewhere out of the way, so you can place buy mode items.
 (you may want to place a table and 2-6 cheap chairs as well).






For the living room place 1 cheap sofa and 1 cheap t.v., maybe a bookshelf and a painting easel.






For the bathroom, the cheapest toilet and cheapest sink, and cheapest shower or bathtub.






For the bedroom(s) get a single bed and 1 double bed. Also, put a cheap wardrobe in and maybe a bedside table.






For any other room you may of thought of making, decorate it with the cheapest furniture, or the task you are trying to carry out, will not work.

 Place a large pot on your camping stove, and add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil. Allow the oil to heat on medium-high until it begins to shimmer, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes., Once the oil is heated, add 1 small, minced onion to the pot. Let the onion cook until it is translucent, which should take 1 to 3 minutes., When the onion is translucent, add ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of garlic powder to the mixture. Stir well, and let the mixture cook until it is fragrant, which should take approximately 1 minute.If you prefer, you can use 2 minced cloves of garlic in place of the garlic powder.
 After the mixture has become fragrant, add a 14.5-ounce (411 g) can of diced tomatoes, a 14.5-ounce (411 g) can of chicken broth, ½ tablespoon (1 g) of dried basil, 1 tablespoon (6 g) of Italian seasoning, and ½ pound (227 g) of pasta to the pot. Mix well to ensure that all of the ingredients are combined.You can use any type of pasta that you like for the dish.
Don’t worry if the liquid doesn’t cover the pasta completely right away. As it cooks, the sauce will thicken and cover the pasta.
 Once the ingredients are mixed, place the lid on the pot. Allow the mixture to come to a boil, which should take 10 to 15 minutes., When the mixture has come to a boil, take the lid off the pot. Continue to cook the mixture until the pasta is tender but still has some bite.The best way to determine if the pasta is done cooking is to taste it and see if you are happy with the texture.
 Once the pasta is finished cooking, spoon the pasta into two bowls. Top the bowls with a handful of parmesan cheese and fresh basil, and serve while it’s still warm.

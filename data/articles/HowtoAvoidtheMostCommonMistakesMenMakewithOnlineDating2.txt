 Women on dating sites get dozens of messages a week from men saying nothing more than "Hi, how are you, want to meet me?" This creates the impression that many men are lazily sending the same message to as many women as possible, hoping to get a response from at least one of them, and trying to sound cool and nonchalant. This strategy backfires. You want to sound specifically interested in her, not desperate for a date with just anyone.
 It doesn't take long, and most people say that poor writing is an instant turn-off.
 Be friendly.

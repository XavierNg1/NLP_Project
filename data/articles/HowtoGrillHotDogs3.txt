 Sure, you can plop that freshly grilled wiener between a couple pasty-white hot dog buns, but why would you want to? Remember that Maillard reaction we talked about? That's what makes toast so good, too. So take advantage of that hot grill.

Turn off your gas grill. It should be plenty hot enough to toast up a couple buns. If you're serving a whole crew, keep it turned on low.






If you're using a charcoal grill, scoot the coals to one side. Put the buns on the cool side.






Open up your buns, slather a little butter on them, and then place them face down on the grill. Close the lid so it warms the whole bun. Keep an eye on them—if your grill is really hot, they can burn quickly.






When they start to brown, rotate them 90°, then give them another 30 seconds or so. Don't let them burn!







, When the bun's done, drop your dog in, and add condiments to your heart's desire. Here are some ideas for toppings:


Mustard—golden, yellow, gray, searing, smooth, or seedy. Hot dogs love it.
Ketchup—the old standby.
Pickle relish—dill, sweet, however you like it.
Raw onions—green, white, yellow, or sweet, it's all good!
Grilled onions—the only thing better than raw onions.
Grilled peppers—is there anything grilled peppers don't taste good on?
Cheese—add a little, add a lot. Pepper jack is a nice change from cheddar or processed cheese, though processed cheese has a really nice melt to it.
Chili—this makes it a little harder to eat with your hands, but it is delicious.
Barbecue sauce—adds to that smokey barbecue thing you have going on here.
Steak sauce—tired of ketchup? kick it up a notch.
Hot sauce—kick it up a couple more notches.
Sauerkraut—yes, it was nasty when you were a kid. Try it now!
Pretty much anything that'll fit on a bun that you like. Okay, maybe not rocky road ice cream, but you know what we mean!


, Enjoy your dog with relish (or any of the other aforementioned condiments).


Before the coals die, roast some marshmallows!

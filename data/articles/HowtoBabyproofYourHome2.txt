 The kitchen is a particularly dangerous area, so it may be simpler to keep your children away form it altogether.
 Kitchen appliances such as the oven and washing machine can be dangerous to small baby. Always make sure the oven doors are closed using anti-tip brackets which can be found in many appliance-parts store. Make sure your child is not around when leaving hot oven unsupervised.


Place sharp items out of reach or in a drawer with a childproof lock.
Use place mats instead of tablecloths, or simply plates.
When cooking, turn saucepan handles towards the back of the stove.
Ensure hot tea and coffee cups are kept well out of reach.

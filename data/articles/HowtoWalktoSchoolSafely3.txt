 A safe crossing has fewer cars and a clear view of traffic. Ideally, a safe crossing also has a crossing guard.Look to see if there is a crossing guard. If there is a crossing guard, they will tell you when to cross the street.
 Before you cross the street, look in both directions to make sure there are no cars coming. Once you have determined that there are no cars coming, you can cross the intersection.


If there is a crossing guard, follow their instructions on when to cross the street., While you are walking to school, you should keep your head up and know where the traffic is at all times., Strangers are neither good nor bad but they are people you do not know. You should be careful around strangers who look suspicious or dangerous and try to avoid them by walking on the other side of the street.


If a stranger approaches you and makes you feel uncomfortable, you should say “no,” and then run away from them. You should also yell loudly as you are running away. Then, find an adult and tell them what happened right away. This is called “No, Go, Yell, Tell.”If you are far from home, phone your parents right away.
 If you get lost on the way to school, find a teacher, firefighter or a police officer. Police officers and firefighters have distinctive uniforms. You should be able to recognize a teacher from your school. Make sure you know where the fire and police stations are located on your walk to school, so you can go for help.


Ask your parents to give you a cell phone with the police phone number programmed into the phone, so you can call for help if necessary.

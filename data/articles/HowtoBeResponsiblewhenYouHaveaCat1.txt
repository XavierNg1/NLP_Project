 Cats need to be in a safe place where there is little chance they can get hurt. If you have any breakable objects, they should be removed or placed out of your cat's reach. For example, vases, figurines, and glassware should be kept behind closed doors. You should also remove any small items, such as rubber bands, beads, safety pins, hair clips, etc. that could be choking hazards.Certain household plants, such as jade and aloe, can be toxic to cats and should be removed from your home. Ask your vet about poisonous household plants.;
, Make sure all wires for televisions, phones, computers, etc. are hidden carefully. Cats are naturally playful and curious and they will likely bite on or play with cords if given the opportunity. This can be very dangerous and your cat could get seriously harmed from biting on an electrical wire.Store wires behind furniture.
Alternatively, you can tape cords to the floor or other furniture so your cat canâ€™t access them.
 Responsible cat owners will not let their cats roam the neighbourhood unsupervised. This can be dangerous to both the cat and other animals in the area. Cats who are allowed outdoors can get into fights with other animals, or eat poisons substances. They are also more likely to be killed by traffic.Outdoor cats may also hunt and kill local songbirds and small rodents, which can have a negative impact on the local environment.

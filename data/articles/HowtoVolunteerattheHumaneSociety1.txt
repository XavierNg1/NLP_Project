 Most Humane Society volunteers are required to complete at least a basic training program or orientation in order to learn all of the safe practices in place at the shelter.Safety is of the utmost importance to shelter workers. Follow all safety rules and suggestions.
Only approach animals you have been cleared to interact with, as some animals may require special handling.;
, While you are not a contracted employee of the shelter, you should always show up to required training courses and attend your volunteer duties on time. Though you may be donating your time, failing to be prompt and helpful will reflect poorly on you and waste other workers’ time. If you are going to be late, be sure to call ahead.Most shelters have predetermined orientation dates, so check with your designated chapter to find out which dates work best for you.
 If, as you are going about your duties, you find that you’ve run into a problem or you are not sure how to handle a situation, make sure you ask! Shelter workers want to make sure both you and the animals you are working with are safe and well taken care of.
 Animals held in shelters have often been neglected or abandoned, and are usually jittery and afraid. Always treat the animals with respect, refraining from making loud noises or sudden movements. Although animal attacks within the ranks of volunteer staff are rare, you do not want to risk further damaging an already-struggling animal’s sense of safety and trust.


Shelter animals require a lot of love and attention. If you are having a rough day, or you are running low on patience or attention, consider changing your duties for the day, or requesting a rescheduled volunteer slot.

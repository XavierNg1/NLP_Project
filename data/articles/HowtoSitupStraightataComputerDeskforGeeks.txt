 Try a position when your legs are in a perfect 90 degree angle and almost in a hovering position over the floor (when the weight of your feet feels light because the majority of weight is distributed through your upper legs onto the chair).;
, It should feel like the majority of weight is distributed through your back instead of it feeling like you're leaning your weight onto the desk through your hands/wrists. If your keyboard tray is too low and causes you to slouch then move your keyboard onto the top of your desk.
 The best height is when your eyes when looking straight are pointed at the top half of the monitor 75-80% from bottom. They also need to be at the right distance. With a 19" monitor, 2' is just about the right distance. Having a desk where you can move your chair's armrests underneath makes this ideal!

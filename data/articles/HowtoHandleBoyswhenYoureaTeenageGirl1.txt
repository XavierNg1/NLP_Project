 Many girls develop communication skills faster than some boys, so it's normal to communicate differently. Often girls are able to think more abstractly than boys, which means that they are more likely to connect thoughts better and provide more details. Because of this, some boys may provide short, direct answers and respond less to questions and comments from you.Don’t assume a boy is upset or doesn't want to talk just because his responses are short. Ask for more details and see if he continues to respond or prolong the conversation. If he doesn't want to talk, he'll continue to give responses that don't go anywhere.;
, Boys are more likely to want to hang out online than girls do, so reach out through social media.Follow him on social media. Use these apps to chat with him.

 Girls are usually more concerned about texting with their friends often than boys are. Even when boys do text their friends, they don’t usually text as much as girls., Take his words at face value. While it’s tempting to try to figure out what a text “might mean,” teenage boys are usually direct about what they mean.


If you want to know what something means, ask a follow-up question.
 While it’s tempting to try to hint at what you want from a boy, he is unlikely to realize what you’re really wanting from a hint. Because he’s used to being direct, he’ll assume that you are as well.


For example, if a boy is going to the smoothie shop and you’re hoping he’ll bring you one, don’t text him, “I’m totally craving a smoothie right now.” He will not get the hint. Instead, text, “I’d really like it if you got me one, too.”

 Between the massive tie-ups near the airport and in DC, getting there could get interesting.;
, From the airport's location on local roads, take Interstate 95 South to the Capitol Beltway. Follow the signs to where 95 and 495 connect (towards Richmond) (If you take Interstate 495 direct, you'll end up with major traffic jams during most weekdays and even most weekends continuing into most evenings.) Follow signs until you reach Interstate 395. Take Interstate 395 into the city. Interstate 395 will terminate as local roads in DC, so be careful of the slowing speed conditions.


Rental cars directly on airport property are sparse. However, if you walk over to the train station, you'll see that there are two Hertz-Rent a Car locations directly around the BWI Airport train station location down "Amtrak Way", but walking the path is dangerous since most of that is a separate Interstate (195) that brings you into the city. Call up some cab companies to take you to the Airport.
 At Union Station, you're in Washington DC, but at the Northeast corner of the district.


Amtrak Acela trains don't make stops at Baltimore Airport, but they do run express through this station onwards southbound to Washington-Union Station or northbound to Baltimore-Penn Station.
The Washington Metro makes stops at numerous places around the city, into some places in Maryland and even several places in Virginia. Look for a Metro location nearby the location you'd like to visit and travel from the Metro inside Union Station to that location when you arrive.

All paper Metro maps tell the reader that all memorials aren't directly connected to the Metro, but the Metro can bring them nearby. There are busses however that can bring readers closer to the memorial areas.
 It may be costly, but if nothing else can help get you from one to the other, the cab will be your only other way out.

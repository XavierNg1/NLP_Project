 Add more of this material until the plants completely cover the trellis.


The dried plant parts are best when they are of the same height (or longer) as the divider you are going to make.
Live plant vines could also be used but they're trickier and you will need to place the container growing the plant down in its final place before weaving. Moreover, moving the divider is much harder when you do this, so it's best for a more "permanent" divider, such as for an office.
Instead of dried plant parts, you can use artificial floral items, such as long leaves, etc.
 Angle the three partitions so that the divider stands in place unaided. Plant containers or similar weighted objects can be used to prevent the divider from falling over if accidentally knocked.

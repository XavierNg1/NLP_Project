, This can be done with a hammer and washcloth, or you can use a mortar and pestle. When they are in pieces, grind them in a clean pepper grinder, or continue using the mortar.


It is suggested you use a pepper grinder for the second phase of grinding as it gets harder to use a mortar as the pieces get small. It is possible, however, to make the pieces smaller with a mortar.
 By this point the beans will have turned into a brown mush. It may look good, but it tastes very bitter.
 Transfer the cocoa bean paste to a smaller pan. Place the smaller pan in the pan of hot water. When the paste is heated, but not cooking, transfer the paste back into the bowl and continue to work with the mortar. Continue to use the mortar on the paste until it is of a smooth consistency.
 When the sugar and flavourings are mixed in, pour the chocolate into moulds, or a large pan that you can cut into small bars. Let the chocolate cool and harden. This can be done a room temperature, or in the fridge covered by foil.

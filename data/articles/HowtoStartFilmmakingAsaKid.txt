 It should probably stay under five pages, since you probably don't have enough time or money to afford a three hour epic. Keep it small. Scripts have particular formats, but you just need to separate dialogue (what characters say) from action.;
, The hardest thing to get is a camera. Try asking your parents if they have one, and if you can use it. If they don't, move on to other family members, like aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc. If they don't have one, try asking your friends. You're bound to find something.
 Your cast can just be a couple of friends who like acting. Try asking around your school's drama club. Try to find your best friends for the crew, or people with lots of patience, because the crew, or the people who help out behind the camera, are usually stuck doing the mundane tasks, like holding the script, lugging equipment around everywhere and getting the actors water.
 For props and costumes, look through your wardrobe, garage/attic, and friends' wardrobes. Try to shoot near your house, or in public property. It's harder to get people's permission for shooting by their house.
 Don't try for the perfect take. Once things are as good as they'll get, move to the next location.
 This is either the most tiring part or the most enjoyable, depending on what your film demands. Most computers nowadays come with editing software built in. Learn how yours works. iMovie is an amazing tool that is easy for a kid to use, but creates professional menus, transitions, and seamless cuts.
 Invite everyone who helped make the movie over for a premiere screening. Send the movie to film competitions and festivals, and get it seen. If you can't do this then, assuming you have the cast's permission, release the film onto an online video sharing website.

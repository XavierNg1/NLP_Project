 When you center yourself on an intention in prayer, you should say truthfully in your heart and mind that you are asking for guidance and need help. Further, you should be open to receiving it and taking action. To be sincere, you should be willing to get an answer and follow through even if it’s not the one you want to hear., Your intention should only be to clearly ask for guidance with firm convictions. Avoid begging or pleading. If you beg or plead, you’re not really asking for guidance, but asking for something you desire to come true., You shouldn’t put Allah on a timetable. Be patient, and avoid showing haste or desperation. Remember not to expect miracles or symbolic visions when praying Istikhara, but to be open to answers in the forms of advice and subtle signs or feelings.

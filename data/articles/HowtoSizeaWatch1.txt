 Most watch faces are between 6 and 10 millimeters thick. If you prefer a smaller or lighter watch, consider choosing one that's closer to 6 millimeters thick. You may want a thinner face if you're bothered by a watch that snags on things.Keep in mind that you'll usually have more control over the diameter of the watch face rather than its thickness.;
, Take a flexible ruler and wrap it around your wrist. This will give you a measurement so you can choose the best diameter for your wrist. For example, for wrists:Smaller than 5 to 6 inches (12 to 15 cm), choose a diameter 38 millimeters or less.
Between 6 and 7 inches (15 to 17 cm), pick a 38 to 42 millimeter diameter.
Between 7.5 and 8 inches (19 to 20 cm), go with a 44 to 46 millimeter diameter.
 Your watch will feel more comfortable if you choose the right size band. Try on several watches to decide how wide you'd like the band to be. If you want to wear a wide band, decide if you'd like it to fit tightly on your wrist. For a looser fitting band, pick a thinner band that can slide up and down on your wrist (like a bracelet)., You have a lot of options when it comes to the strap material. If you expect you'll be sizing the watch a lot, choose a material that will be easy to adjust. Fabric or leather straps might be the easiest to adjust since you can simply use a different hole to secure the strap.If you choose metal straps, you'll need to use jeweler's tools to add or remove links when sizing the watch.
 Once you've selected a watch, try it on and ask the jeweler to make any adjustments. Ask if you can take home extra links or a spare strap so you can size the watch in the future. Many jewelers will be happy to add holes to watch bands or remove extra links from the band.

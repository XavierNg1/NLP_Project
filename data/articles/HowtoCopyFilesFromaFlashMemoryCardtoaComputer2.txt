 A multi-card reader is a commercially available hardware peripheral device designed to be compatible with as many as 20 different formats of flash memory cards.


Confirm that the multi-card reader is compatible with the format of your memory card prior to purchasing a device. There are many different multi-card readers on the market, and not all of them will be compatible with your memory card.
 Typically, the device will connect to the computer using a USB connection.
 Once the multi-card reader is connected, insert the memory card into the designated card slot. A dialog box will open on the desktop and guide you through the process of transferring the files from the flash memory card to a specified location on the computer hard drive. The files have been copied from the memory card onto the computer using a multi-card reader.

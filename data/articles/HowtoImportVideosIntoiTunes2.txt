 Oftentimes videos downloaded from torrents will have multiple periods in the name to denote who ripped and encoded the video. Remove any of these extra periods, as they can cause problems when trying to import into iTunes.


Right-click on the file and select "Rename" to edit the name.
 Make sure that you are running the latest version.
 Click the File menu (Windows) or iTunes menu (OS X) and select "Add File to Library" (Windows) or "Add to Library" (OS X). Browse for the converted video and select it.


If you are using Windows and don't see the File menu, press the Alt key.
You will not receive any error or confirmation when adding a video file.
 This is located in the row of buttons along the top of the iTunes window, and looks like a film strip.
 Any movie you import will be added as a "Home Video". If you don't see the video that you just imported, it wasn't properly converted to an iTunes-compatible format.
 It can be difficult to find the video you want if they're all sorted into the "Home Video" library. Moving them to the proper spot will make it easier to watch or sync the videos later.


Right-click the video and select "Get Info".
Click the "Options" tab in the window that appears.
Click "Home Video" next to "media kind" to select the library that you want to move it to.
Click OK to save the changes. You will now be able to find the video in the proper library.
 Now that the files are in iTunes, you can sync them to your iOS device. Click here for details on syncing.


If the video does not sync to your device, you'll need to create a version in iTunes that your device supports. Click File and select "Create New Version". Select the device that you are syncing the video to, and then wait for the conversion to complete.

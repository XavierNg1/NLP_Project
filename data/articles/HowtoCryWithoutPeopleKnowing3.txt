 If you were wearing makeup before you were crying, at least remove the makeup from your eyes. At this point, it’s probably ruined anyway. You will need to splash your face with water, if possible, and it is also likely that you’ve smeared it all anyway. Thus, you should remove your makeup with a makeup remover if possible.


If you don’t have any makeup remover with you, try using soap and water, or a wet paper towel. If you don’t have anything do your best to gently wipe away your makeup with a tissue or towel.
 Make the water as cold as you can stand, and gently splash it onto your face several times. This will help take any redness and swelling away.


Alternatively, you can place cucumbers or some ice cubes wrapped in a towel on your eyes to help reduce the redness and swelling.
Whatever you do, avoid rubbing your face vigorously! This will only make the redness worse.
 If you can, use an eye drop in each eye. This will clear them up, and remove any redness.
 It will help calm you down, too.
 If you have some moisturizer handy, apply some to your face, as it will help remove any tightness you have around your eyes., If you were wearing it, you will need to reapply. Make sure to reapply your foundation and blush, as the tears may have made streaks down your cheeks.


If your eyes are still a bit puffy and red, try applying a brighter lipstick, which will draw the attention away from your eyes.
 If it is still very obvious that you have been crying, slip on a pair of sunglasses. However, don’t do this if, for example, you are at work or school where you sit at a desk. People will know something is up.


If you feel that you have to wear sunglasses to hide it, you could use the excuse that you were at the eye doctor, and you were instructed to wear them for a few hours.
You could also say that your eyes are feeling very sensitive to light, and the sunglasses are helping with the pain.

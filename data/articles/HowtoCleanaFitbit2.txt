 Rubbing alcohol can be found at any general store or drugstore. Water should not be used, since it can damage the electrical parts inside the tracker. Use a toothpick or old toothbrush rather than a metal scrubber so you don’t scrape the tracker’s plating.
 Locate the gold-colored charging port on the back of the tracker. Scrub using the toothbrush or use the toothpick to pick out any debris you find., Cotton swabs (Q-tips) can be purchased alongside rubbing alcohol at general stores and drugstores. Again, avoid introducing water into the electrical circuit or using abrasive scrubbers that damage the metal.
 Clean out both ends of the charging cable. Push the swab into the openings and brush off the pins inside them. Make sure all debris is removed before you finish., Excess moisture can be removed on the charge port by using a soft cloth or tissue. Otherwise, the ports and pins should look dry within a few minutes. Then it is safe to charge your tracker again.

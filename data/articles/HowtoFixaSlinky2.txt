 Hold both ends of the slinky, one in each hand. Pull them apart in opposite directions, just enough that you can see exactly where the tangle is. Keep holding them in that position.


This method is for slinkies with only a few of its loops tangled. If your slinky is too tangled to form a straight line when pulled apart, you can try this with just one small section of the slinky, or switch to the extremely tangled slinky method instead.
 Hold the other end steady as you rotate. Rotating in one direction will make the tangled loops move farther apart; this is the direction you want. If you start rotating and the tangled loops grate tightly together, stop and reverse the direction you're rotating.
 Once the tangled loops have some space between them, look closely to see which loop is out of place. Lift that loop up away from the straight line of the slinky. If you keep the slinky stretched apart, the loop should snap back into the correct place as soon as you let go. If it doesn't, pick it up again and guide it carefully back between the right loops, rotating if necessary.


This step is easier if you ask a friend to hold one end of the slinky while you do this.

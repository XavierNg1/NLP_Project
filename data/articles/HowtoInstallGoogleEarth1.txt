Google Earth is officially supported on Ubuntu;
, You can download Google Earth for free from Google's website. When you visit the Google Earth website, you will be greeted with the message "Hello, Earth" as well as a random image from Google Maps.
 In the center of the page, there will be two options: Google Earth and Google Earth Pro. Standard Google Earth is free for everyone. The Pro version costs money, but contains more tools for marketers and business planners.
 This will take you to the "Google Earth for Desktop" page. Note that this version works for laptops as well; "Desktop" refers to desktop applications instead of browser-based applications.
 This is located in the lower-right corner of the collage on the Google Earth for Desktop page.
 Before you are able to download, you will need to read the policy. Downloading the program means that you agree to both the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy.

 Once the setup file has finished downloading, install the program to access it:



Windows - Double-click the downloaded setup file. The program will connect to the Google Earth server and download a few necessary files. After a moment, Google Earth will install itself and then start immediately. You do not need to set any options during the installation process.

After the lsb-core package finishes installing (or is already installed), double-click the .deb file that was downloaded from the Google Earth website.

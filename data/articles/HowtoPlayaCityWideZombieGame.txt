 You (If you want to) and your friends are the game 'mods' or the game runners- you manage all the people that play.;
, The main rules for the game are:


The game starts with a number of zombies. (1 zombie for every 5 humans is good).
Each player is given a way of showing when they are playing, and what are they. (bandannas on the head for humans and on the arm for zombies).
humans are given (or they get themselves) weapons. These may be Nerf guns, paper guns, or prop guns (make sure it can't hurt somebody, like airsoft guns).
An infection time from getting tagged (It could be instant)
when zombies get hit (with a prop gun just say 'boom') they 'die' for a certain amount of time, then keep playing.
'Defense' battles have a group of people that must survive by killing an entire hoard (a group of zombies). Zombies don't revive until the end of the battle.
 Once a human turns into a zombie, somebody needs to tell the 'mods' somehow.
 There is only one human left 2. When the nuke hits or the army comes (a time limit)

 If you plan on using liquid watercolor, use a hallow or blown-out egg instead. This is because liquid watercolors (the kind that come in a bottle) aren't food-safe.


White eggs will give you the brightest results, but you can use browns ones too for a more interesting effect.;
, This method works best with two different colors, but you can use just one color, if you prefer.You can also use liquid watercolor, but keep in mind that it is not suitable for consumption and best for hallow or blown-out eggs.If you are using liquid watercolor, you can make it lighter by adding some water to it.If you don't have any watercolor paint, mix together a few drops of food coloring, 1 teaspoon of vinegar, and 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 milliliters) of water. This makes it food safe too.Most kids' watercolor paints are non-toxic and should be food safe. Check the label to be sure, however.
 A pouncer is a small, round, sponge brush.You can also try sucking the paint up with an eyedropper, although this works better for liquid watercolor., As you press the sponge against the egg, the watercolor will come out of it and flow down the sides of the egg.


If you are using a dropper, simply squeeze a few drops onto the egg in the same spot., This will give you a striped or banded effect. If you want to, you can turn the egg so that the color goes all the way around it., Once the paint dries, you can add more stripes using the same color or a contrasting color. You can even add more water to your original color, and make more stripes in lighter shades.

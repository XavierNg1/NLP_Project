 Skiing is a popular winter sport and is a fun activity for both children and adults. A skier glides down snow slopes using two long, thin boards to maintain balance and control. Your feet are strapped onto each ski board. Skiers use these boards to control their balance, speed, and direction.Skiing can be learned fairly quickly, so it's a recommended sport if you're anxious to hit the slopes. Other winter sports can take a bit longer to learn.
There are many large and famous ski slopes, but there are also many smaller and local ski slopes.

 The Georgia Technology Authority maintains the Register Official Vital Event Records website, known by the acronym “Rover,” where you can order certified copies of Georgia birth or death certificates.;
, To get a copy of your birth certificate online, you must provide your full name, address, email address, date and place of birth (including the city, county and hospital), and the full name of your mother and father.


If you don’t have all of the required information, you should call Georgia’s Vital Records Call Center at (404) 679-4702 prior to placing your order., Before the state completes your order, you must send a copy of an approved photo identification, such as a driver’s license or a passport.


When you make a copy of your ID, enlarge the photo to at least 100% and lighten the shade.
Put the copy of your ID on the cover sheet included with your order. Print it out and sign it, then scan it and email it to DPH-ROVER@dph.ga.gov.
You can also make your own cover sheet. Make sure it includes the same information as the cover sheet included with your order: your name and your signature, the name on the birth certificate, your order confirmation number and the date your order was placed., Georgia charges a $25 search fee and an $8 processing fee for online orders of certified copies.


If you want an additional copy of the same birth certificate, you can request it at the same time for an additional $5 fee.

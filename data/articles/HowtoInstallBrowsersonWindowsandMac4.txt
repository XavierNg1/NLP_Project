 Mac OS has an easy process to install applications. Just download the DMG file from the links for the browser of your choice, and follow the next steps.


Download the DMG file for your browser installer this site: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/.
The link should download the DMG file automatically.
 Once the download has finished, locate the file by using the Downloads icon at the far right of your dock.


It should open a folder with an icon resembling the browser of your choice.
 Next, open the Finder by clicking on the icon with two melded faces in the dock. Once it is opened, click “Applications” in the left pane.


The Applications folder should open.
 Now, go to your download folder (the one with the browser icon in it) and drag the icon to the Applications folder. This will install the browser and add it to the icons list in the Launchpad application in your dock.


The browser may also appear in your dock among the ones you already have.

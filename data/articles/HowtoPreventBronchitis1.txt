 From a coworker with a cold to your childâ€™s friend with the flu, you are constantly exposed to people who can get you sick. When you know someone is sick, try to avoid being near them. If you do have to be near them, wash your hands when they leave and avoid sharing anything.;
, This mostly involves washing your hands anytime you are exposed to something that could get your sick. When you wash your hands, make sure you wash them with warm water and soap. Occasions where you should wash your hands include:Going to the bathroom
Riding public transportation
Being around someone who is sick
Handling raw meat
Anytime you sneeze or cough

, However, if this is not the case at your job (or in your life), another option is to carry with you a small bottle of alcohol-based hand sanitizer. You can then use it anytime you are touching public surfaces, or anytime you are around someone with a cold or flu.


Also avoid touching your face, especially when your hands are not clean.

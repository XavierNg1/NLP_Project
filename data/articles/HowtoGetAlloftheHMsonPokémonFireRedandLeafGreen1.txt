 After you've defeated all of the trainers, go East and battle the trainers (and catch any wild Pokémon you come across).;
, The Pokémon Researcher Bill will be there looking like a Pokémon. Go up and talk to him and help him out.
, Board the ship and battle all of the trainers and then go find the Captain. He'll give you Hidden Move 1, Cut. Cut allows you to cut down small trees blocking the way of paths you couldn't get before.


You'll be battling Gary when you head towards the Captain. Make sure your Pokémon are strong and able to battle (there is a girl who rests Pokémon on the ship).

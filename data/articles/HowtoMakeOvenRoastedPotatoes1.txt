 You want finely minced garlic that is only a few millimeters thick.


You may substitute 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder if you don't have fresh garlic

, You want all of the potatoes to be well coated in the oil. As the oil heats up in the over it will fry the outside of the potato, getting it perfectly crispy.

 The timing doesn't have to be exact, but you should try to flip the potatoes at least twice as they cook.
 The outside will be an inviting shade of golden brown. Using a fork, knife, or skewer, gently poke the side of a large potato. The fork should pass through the potato without much effort like it was a firm piece of butter.

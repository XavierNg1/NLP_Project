 Since it is your sweet sixteen, it is important for you to make sure you enjoy yourself. Don't get too overwhelmed by the demands of others, but instead focus on yourself- it is your party chiefly.;
, Keep in mind that money spent on food may detract from other areas of your party. It's important to stay balanced with your budget, especially if it is limited. If you are on a tight budget, consider choosing simple dishes, like chicken nuggets and pizza, rather than expensive complicated dishes like Penne Vodka or Chicken Parmesan from a costly restaurant.
 If your Sweet Sixteen's theme is the outdoors, then consider choosing a menu that would resemble that of a picnic. Or, if your Sweet Sixteen's theme is beachy, you may want to serve seafood.
 It's important to stay within the boundaries that your parents set for you, in terms of cost and availability.
 Although you should aim to please yourself as for food options at your sweet sixteen, it's also best to keep in mind your guest;s preferences. For example, if the majority of your friends do not like seafood, do not order seafood.
 Never forget to make available food for those of your friends that need special dishes. Try to choose allergen-free dishes that are similar to your menu otherwise.

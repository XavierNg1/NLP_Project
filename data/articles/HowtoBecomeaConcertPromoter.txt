This could be a concert promoter, a talent agency, a band manager, or a concert hall.;
,


You will need to learn how a band is contacted and signed for a show, how concert venues are booked and rented, what goes into marketing a show, and how to hire staff for the night of the event.
Learn everything you can about the financial side of promoting concerts, from artists' fees to ticket receipts to the percentage that a concert promoter or venue takes.



If you plan on promoting concerts of a certain type of music, meet as many performers and managers in that field as possible. Focus on the city or region in which you want to work: get to know the owners and managers of concert venues, talent agents, record label representatives, and radio station managers.



Depending on the size of the concert and the act performing, you will need to use a variety of marketing strategies, such as posting flyers, buying radio advertisements, hosting ticket giveaways, and using social networks.



Because you need to hire many one-night employees for putting on a concert, it is a good idea to have an idea of your labor pool. In some cases, you may need to hire these people at the last minute.



In addition to working on their own, many promoters hold an official position with a concert hall or stadium. Having such a position means that you do not have to worry about booking your own venues; however, your profit margin will be less.
 Put on shows by acts you have already worked with, and keep the logistics to a minimum.
 As your business grows, you can start to draw up standardized contracts and maintain a more stable revenue flow.

 Whether it is a hardware or software firewalls will determine how you will access it. The best way to do this is to "fingerprint" it. Open your browser (Opera, Firefox, Internet Explorer, whatever your school uses) and go to a site you know is blocked (in this case www.Myspace.com Myspace). You should see a blocked message. Try to use this to figure out the type, for example, in my school the words '8e6 R3000' show up. Yours may be somewhere else in the page.;
, If the results show up and they are irrelevant, try to go on websites where you might be able to buy it. This is important because there will be specific information there which will tell you how it blocks Myspace and other sites, and might give you an idea as to how to go over its head.
 There is a problem with most firewalls when it comes to SSL, because it is an encryption.
 Obtain the IP address of the site(In Myspace's case this is 63.135.80.49 ). Then, covert each IP number into an eight digit binary number. If the number isn't eight binary digits long, pad it by adding some zeros in front (for example make 1 into 00000001). In our case this would be 63=00111111; 135=10000111; 80=01010000; 49=00110001. Now place the numbers together (Don't add them, just place) to create a 32-digit binary number. Again, in our case, this is 00111111100001110101000000110001 . (Without the period, of course). Then, convert this 32 digit binary to a decimal number. for Myspace this is 1065832497 . Enter this into your address field, without the www. part, and this will load the webpage.
 make sure the Program files and everything go on the disk. then bring it to school and try to use it as a browser on the school computer. Some firewalls (especially software ones) won't see this coming and might allow you on Myspace.

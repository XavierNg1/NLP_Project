 Set your oven to 350ºF (175ºC) and wait for it to preheat. This method is gentle on pasta and sauces, but may not be practical for a single serving.
 Spread the pasta across a shallow dish. A deep pile of pasta may heat unevenly.


If the pasta is dry, add a splash of milk or extra sauce to keep it moist. This is especially important for lasagna., The pasta is usually ready in 20 minutes, but check after 15 just in case. The foil should help trap moisture, slowing the drying process.


Optionally, add a sprinkle of Parmesan under the foil 5 minutes before the pasta is done., Stick a metal fork into the center of the pasta dish and wait for 10 to 15 seconds. If the tip of the fork is hot to the touch, the pasta is ready. If not, return the pasta to the oven.

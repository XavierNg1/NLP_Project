 Try to keep your dog out of situations where he gets to practice and exhibit his guarding behavior. This means not allowing him to patrol up and down the fence, but keeping him indoors and giving him exercise in the park instead and taking your dog to another room when guests arrive.For dogs that bark at the front door when visitors arrive, consider keeping him on a long leash and taking him into another room as soon as guests arrive.
If your dog barks, don’t react or shout. Otherwise, your dog may interpret your reaction as you joining in and it may encourage is barking.
 Put the bowl down but with only part of his dinner in it. As he eats, scatter more of his dinner as close to the bowl as he allows you to get. If necessary, keep some food in a treat bag and each time you walk past the bowl, scatter some food in the bowl so that he begins to link your presence with plentiful food.Start with an empty bowl and have your dog sit on command. As soon as he sits, put a handful of food into the bowl and let him eat. Then command him to “Sit” again and put in another handful. Repeat. This reinforces you are in control and also that you are the provider of food.
 Once your dog reaches the point where she no longer shows aggressive behavior to her trigger, keep using positive reinforcement to let her know she is doing well. Praise her and provide treats in instances where she does just fine with the stimulus in order to keep strengthening those associations.

 Physical therapy (PT) may be prescribed by a physician for long-standing neck and back pain secondary to spondylosis. PT may combine passive treatments, such as ice and heat, ultrasound, and electrical stimulation, with therapeutic exercises to stretch and strengthen neck, abdominal, and back muscles.Physical therapy is usually prescribed for chronic pain that has lasted for several weeks without responding to other treatments.
Massage therapy may also be introduced into your physical therapy routine. A professional massage therapist will work on the muscles in your back to soothe and relax them after you have exerted them.
The goal of PT is to prevent recurring pain.
 Spinal manipulation performed by a chiropractor may also help relieve the pain of spondylosis, especially with the first month of pain. It works by realigning vertebrae, which have been misaligned due to weakness in the spine brought on by spondylosis. Overall, it is a safe procedure.The most common side effects are generally minor and include fatigue and temporary muscle soreness. Extremely rare complications of spinal manipulation may include weakness, loss of feeling in legs or arms, and bowel or bladder problems.
 Acupuncture is a popular treatment for long-standing neck and back pain. Acupuncture for spondylosis involves inserting very thin needles, about the size of a human hair, into the neck or back. The needles can be twirled, electrically stimulated, or warmed to augment the results of treatment.It is thought that acupuncture balances the chi of the body, which flows in meridians. An alternative explanation may be that acupuncture causes the release of chemicals that reduce pain and inflammation.

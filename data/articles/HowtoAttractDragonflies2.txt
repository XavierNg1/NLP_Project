 You can’t just have a pond and attract dragonflies. You need water plants in the pond to help attract them. Dragonflies love tall plants! The dragonflies will lay their eggs in the plants, and the larvae will live in them until they are grown. Then, they will use the tall plants to perch on.Stock the pond with both submerged and floating plants. They will use the underwater plants when they are larvae, and perch on the tall plants when they are adults.
Try getting eelgrass, fanwort, hornwort, anacharis, wild celery, corkscrew rush, blue flag iris, parrot’s feather, pondweed, water lilies, and lotus flowers.
You can find water plants at garden centers and online.
 Place shrubs around the edge of the pond to give the dragonflies more places to land. This also makes your pond even more beautiful and appealing. The dragonflies will have more places to perch and live. You can plant border plants and shrubs.For example, you can try lobelia, seedbox, or button bush.
You can also let the natural grass and brush around the pond grow to give the dragonflies more vegetation.
 Rocks in and around your pond will make it even more beautiful. Dragonflies also love to perch on warm rocks, especially flat rocks. Place rocks in your pond and around the edges to give the dragonflies plenty of places to land.You can try a mixture of light and dark rocks. The dragonflies may be attracted to one over the other.
 Dragonflies like sunshine, so they will be more attracted to a pond that is out in the open with full sunshine in the middle of the day than one covered by the shade of tree branches., While you are waiting for your plants to grow tall enough for dragonflies to perch on, place sticks in your pond. This gives the dragonflies somewhere to land.You can try sticks that you get from nearby trees or bamboo stakes for plants and vegetables.

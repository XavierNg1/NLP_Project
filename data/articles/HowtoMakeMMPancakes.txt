 You'll need all the ingredients above, as well as a whisk, measuring cups, a bowl, a flipper, and a griddle/pan to cook the pancakes on.;
, If you have a pancake griddle, turn it on so that it has time to heat up. If you're using a pan, heat up the stove top.
 Measure 1 cup of Bisquick (or your favourite pancake mix) and put it into a glass bowl.
 Measure a 1/2 cup of milk and add it into the bowl of Bisquick.
 Crack an egg into the bowl of milk and the pancake mix.
 Whisk the contents of the glass bowl until it's thoroughly blended and has a nice consistency.
 Use a soup ladle or spoon of your choice and scoop a few spoonfuls of mix onto the griddle.
 Grab a handful of M&Ms and sprinkle them onto the pancakes.
 Once you think the pancakes are ready, flip them over and let them cook on the other side. Once they've cooked, put them on a plate and enjoy.

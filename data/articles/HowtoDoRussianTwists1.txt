 Place the mat near a couch or another piece of furniture that has a small, but big enough, space to stick your feet under. The resistance from the couch will stabilize your body while you do the twists. Lie down on the mat with your knees bent and place your feet under the couch.Alternatively, you can have a friend hold your feet down for you instead of the couch.;
, Your upper body should be at a 45-degree angle to the floor. Hold out your arms in front of you and clasp your hands together. Clench your abdominal muscles, pulling your bellybutton in toward your spine. This is the starting position. Make sure your spine is straight and not rounded.In this position, your upper body and thighs should create a “V” shape.
Your arms should be straight and fully extended in front of you, as well.
Keeping your abs tight engages the deeper transverse abdominal muscles, which will help protect your spine during the exercise.
 With your arms extended in front of you, twist your torso to the right side. Twist until your arms are parallel to the floor. Hold the position for a second or two and breathe out. Then, move back to the starting position and repeat the same technique for the left side. This is one repetition.If your shoulders begin to hunch while performing the exercise, re-straighten your spine.
Try to do three sets of eight to 12 repetitions. If this is too difficult, then do three sets of five to eight repetitions.

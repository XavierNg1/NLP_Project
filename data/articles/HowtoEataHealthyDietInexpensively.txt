 Oatmeal is a great choice as it is easy to make (you can just microwave for 1-5 min), and it is relatively cheap (e.g. you can buy a large box for only $1.79 in some stores, for a cost of only about 15 cents per meal). Brown rice is another good option, but it takes longer to cook (usually an hour).;
, Fresh cabbage is a great choice and usually costs less than other vegetables.
 Olive oil is healthy and tastes good, but it could be expensive. Canola oil is another good choice.
, Eat a small portion of protein rounded out with a whole grain. A classic example is red beans and rice. You could also eat chicken and noodles or perhaps a stir-fry served over rice.

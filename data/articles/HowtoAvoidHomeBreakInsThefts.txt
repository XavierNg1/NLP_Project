 This makes it incredibly easy for a criminal to steal items, without difficulty of getting them out of the home (except some furniture); and without leaving visible evidence of the theft, that a neighbor can see from the outside of the home.;
,, By placing valuables in plain-sight; such as having valuables in locations that abut a window, especially on the first floor of the home (i.e. large television or computer system directly behind the large front windows of your home.).
 Be careful of who is knowledgeable of your valuables. By bragging (or telling) about your valuables, even to people you believe are not going to be the burglars; you increase your risk of a home invasion. Even if they are completely innocent, they could possibly tell somebody who is not as upstanding. For those who post information of what they own online, you should also be careful.
 However, in city environments, these can provide additional security to your home. Invest in a quality alarm, preferably with a cellular backup (because it is quite easy for a criminal to disconnect phone wires leading to your home). Be sure to turn it on, especially in the following situations:


You leave your home, and nobody is there. Even if you are only gone for a short period of time.
When you are home alone.
When you are sleeping.
 By removing vegetation that makes it difficult for others to see around your home, you lower the risk that they can make a silent entry.
 If that garage has windows, be sure to put shades or blinds over them; so criminals cannot see what kind of transportation they can steal.

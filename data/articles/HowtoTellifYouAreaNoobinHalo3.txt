 Maybe you can trash your friends, but that doesn't mean you aren't a noob. Jump on Xbox Live and try your skills against the larger Halo community. Just watch outâ€”you're swimming with the sharks now.
 You never know if you are going to be matched against serious players or other potential noobs like yourself. So try a bunch of games to play against a variety of different people.
 Were you able to hold your own? Or were you constantly getting shot down from a mysterious direction? If you found yourself constantly cut down unexpectedly without knowing how, you are likely still a noob.


On Team Slayer, were you able to work with your team members effectively? Did you know where your help was needed? Could you pay attention to which enemies had already taken damage and finish them off before their shields recharged? Did you work to help your team win, or did you just try your own random strategy?

 It's a long and wavy green plant that grows in the oceans. You'll usually find it at the end of the lands your Blockhead character is on.


Kelp won't grow in lands where there is seasonal freezing. If it does grow in such an area, you'll find it bobbing above the ice when the ice forms.
 Send your Blockhead character into the water where the kelp is growing. Kelp growing next to land or a structure can be harvested from a standing position without getting into the water.

By hand. Tap on the kelp. One kelp will result.






Using a machete. Go to the inventory and arm your Blockhead character with a machete. Tap on the kelp and three kelp will result.
 This will ensure the kelp continues to grow.

If harvesting kelp below water, watch your breath bar. It will turn blue when your Blockhead character goes underwater and this will turn red as your character's air supply begins to run out. Surface for air before the character box turns red (your character takes damage when this happens). Note that eating the kelp will restore a portion of the breath bar.
 This will make it easier to harvest without running out of air.;
, Keep it next to a seaside structure that you've created. It can be as long as you want it to be.


Leave at least two blocks of water between the base and the surface of the water. If your Blockhead can stand still, it's probably too short as you need to let the kelp grow at least two blocks so that it isn't destroyed when harvested.
 Let it grow. Harvest regularly. This kelp can only grow as long as the blocks you've left it space for, so you'll get less but it can be harvested often and easily. Plus, your Blockhead character gets a nice bath!

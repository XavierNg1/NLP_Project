 It is a good idea to choose a sunny spot that can be easily viewed. When planning, consider such things as placement near flower beds, alternating colour types and plant types, and the possibility of using the herbs as well as admiring them for their presentation.;
, The herbs to prefer are those which have a good strong colour or have variations in colour that make them interesting. Some good choices include:


Golden lemon thyme (Thymus citriodorus "Aureus")
Golden marjoram (Origanum vulgare "Aureum")
Golden feverfew (Chrysanthemum parthenium "Golden Ball")
Ginger mint
Purple basil (see the image in the introduction)

Sage (Salvia), tricolour and purple types

, It is helpful to plan out the placement on paper first. When put together in clumps, the colour feast should look amazing.
 After foliage, consider a focus on the flowers produced by many herbs. Beautiful colourful flowers can be found on a wide variety of herbs, including chives, borage, valerian, feverfew, clary sage, thyme, lavender, etc. If you focus on foliage first, then you will have guaranteed consistent colour and when flowering time occurs, you gain an added dimension with the different colours from the blooms.

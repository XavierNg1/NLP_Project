 After washing your hair, remove excess water from your locks with a towel. Apply a quarter-sized amount of leave-in-conditioner from the roots to the ends of your hair. Allow your hair to air dry until it is only slightly damp.The leave-in-conditioner will make the ends of your hair easier to manage.
 Setting curls in the lower half of your hair will add volume and bounce to your tresses—it is also much more comfortable to sleep in.


Retrieve your 1 to 1 ½ inch sponge rollers.
Grab a 1 inch section of hair at the right front side of your head.
Unclip the roller and place it at the ends of the 1 inch section.
Wind your hair around the roller towards your face.
Stop rolling once you reach the middle of the shaft and secure the roller in place.
Repeat until all of your hair is set in rollers., When you wake up in the morning, remove the rollers from your hair one at a time. As you unwind your hair, avoid yanking and pulling on the curls. Once all the rollers are out, grab your hair with one hand just above the curls. With the other hand, comb your fingers through your locks. Smooth out any unruly curls with a boar bristle brush.

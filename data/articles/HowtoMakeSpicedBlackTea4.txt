 Measure 4 cups (960 ml) of water into a saucepan and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add 4 black tea bags, 3/4 cup (150 g) of granulated sugar, 2 anise stars, 1 smashed green cardamom pod, and 2 whole cloves. Stir the Thai tea as it heats, so the sugar dissolves.You can use a strong black tea like Assam, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, or Darjeeling).
 Boil the Thai tea for 3 minutes, so the water darkens and the flavors develop. Take the saucepan off of the heat and just let the tea steep for at least 30 minutes. This also gives it a chance to cool down a little.You can steep the tea for up to 2 hours for a stronger flavor.
 Set a fine sieve over a measuring jug or tea pot and carefully pour the cooled Thai tea through it. You can discard the solids that are left in the sieve. Refrigerate the Thai tea until you're ready to ice it.Keep in mind that you can refrigerate the Thai tea for a few days, but it may turn cloudy over time.
 When you're ready to serve the Thai iced tea, fill about four glasses with ice and pour in the chilled Thai tea. Leave about 1/3 to 1/4 at the top of each glass, so you can pour in 1/4 cup (60 ml) of half and half. Serve the Thai iced tea right away.You can also use coconut milk, whole milk, or sweetened condensed milk instead of half and half.

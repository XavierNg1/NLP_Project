 Sketch a horizontal line for the horizon as in the first method.
 This point may be located below the bottom of the paper (outside the paper.) You don't need to actually mark the point.
 The usual method for this is to sketch a first line from the point of view in a 60 degree angle to the left and mark your vanishing point where this line intersects the horizon.
 For this you will draw a second line from the point of view in a 30 degree angle to the right. Again, the vanishing point will be the intersection of this line and the horizon. The 60 and 30 degree angles can be different, but the angle between the lines that go from the eye of the observer to the vanishing points have to form a 90 degree angle.
, These lines will determine the proportion of the sizes of the objects when they are located closer or farther from the point of view.


Make light, temporary guidelines with a ruler (shown here in green) to make sure your details are in perspective. Erase these guidelines later.

 Make sure the wire is pliable enough to be bent into the shape of a circle, and sturdy enough to hold its shape under the weight of mini pumpkins and gourds.
 Grocery stores and farmer's markets are brimming with tiny orange squashes throughout the fall season. Pick out small, lightweight pumpkins and gourds for your wreath.


Try to find pumpkins and gourds with interesting colors and textures. Choose orange, yellow, brown, green, and mottled pumpkins and gourds.
If you want a more uniform wreath, choose pumpkins that are all the same size and color.
For a longer-lasting wreath, go to a craft store and buy faux pumpkins and gourds instead of using fresh, perishable items.
 Create a pretty pattern with contrasting shapes, colors and sizes. Choose to alternate pumpkins with gourds or make a more random assembly of squash.


To skewer pumpkins, place the wire on one side of the pumpkin (an inch or so below the stem) and push it through the pumpkin horizontally so it comes out the other side.
To skewer gourds, place the wire at the largest part of the squash and push it through so that it comes out the other side.
 Use your fingers or a pair of pliers to bend the ends into c-shapes, then hook them together.
 Tie an autumnal ribbon at the base of the wreath, or add a sprig of evergreen as an accent.
 Fasten a string or a piece of wire into a loop, with its base tied or wrapped around the c-hooks you created to hold the wreath together. Hang the wreath from a nail on your front door or on your house.

 Kupika is very friendly. Don't be afraid to message someone with very random stuff, like dinosaurs. Most people take fairly well to this, but be wary.


Never message someone simply saying, "Hey, want to be friends?" Kupikans are very, very annoyed by this habit of newcomers.
 People of all ages, genders, nationalities and races log onto Kupika. Do not ever make fun of someone for any of the above reasons.

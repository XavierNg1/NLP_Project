 Squeeze your palms tightly together in front of your chest. Your arms should be quivering a bit as you are pushing your palms together.;
,, As you use your leg muscles to leap forward, quickly straighten your arms, using the pent-up force from pushing your palms together to your advantage. This should propel you forward, with the forward momentum of your movement and your arms concentrated in the spear-like tips of your fingers.
 Practice an individual horizontal roll. From a crouching position, shift your body weight clockwise, flipping onto your back and completing the spin by reasserting your original position coming up from the left. Practice this, and do it faster and faster.
 Aim for the opponent's groin or solar plexus. The thrust itself is the force equivalent of a sledgehammer to the groin or chest. Combined with a spin, this concentrates the surface of contact onto the rotating tips of your fingers, drilling your opponent and sending him to the ground hard.

 At this temperature, the chicken will cook quickly and thoroughly without drying. Since the final product may be sitting in your fridge for a week if you have leftovers, you need to preserve all the moisture that you can.;
, This is because you will be cooking the chicken at a high heat; if this is done without bringing it to room temperature, it will cook quickly on the outside but remain raw on the inside. If your chicken is completely frozen, you can put it in warm water for about twenty minutes before starting the cooking process. If it’s simply been refrigerated, leave it on the counter for a little while before cooking.
 Drizzle it with a little bit of canola oil so that it doesn't stick to the sheet while baking.
 It's better to start with salt and pepper, but you can try other spices that suit your taste.
 This is what gives the dish its name, therefore do it in the best way you can.
 Put them in the oven and set the timer for twenty minutes.
 Check on the breasts every now and then, to make sure they don't get burnt. When the timer goes off, cut into the thickest piece of chicken to check that there’s no pink in the middle. If it’s entirely white, it’s safe to assume that the other thinner pieces of chicken are fully cooked as well. If there’s any pink in the middle, put the chicken back in the oven and check it again after five minutes.
 Pack the rest in a gallon-sized Ziploc (resealable) bag for easy access throughout the week, and store in the refrigerator until needed.

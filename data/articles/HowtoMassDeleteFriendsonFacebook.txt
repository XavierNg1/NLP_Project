 Facebook does not support deleting multiple friends at once, so you'll need to use a browser extension to mass delete. The extension Friend Remover PRO for Chrome is the most functional of the options. This extension will not have access to your Facebook login email or password.


It is not possible to do this from a mobile device. You must use the desktop version of Chrome that supports browser extensions.;

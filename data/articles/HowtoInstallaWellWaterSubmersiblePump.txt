, Check the details on the submersible motor looking for power supply rating, identify whether it is a 2-wire single phase, a 3 wire single phase and needs a pump stater box or 3 phase configuration. Check that the submersible pump drop cable suits the motor cable and motor and is correctly rated for submersion in water. Check that the fittings match the outlet on the pump, the rising main and the bore cap., Use supplied grease to lubricate and seal splined shaft on assembly. Tape poly pipe or lay flat fitting with thread tape and screw into pump., Follow instructions supplied with kit., Fit rising main to pump and roll out. Fit bore cap to the other end of rising main., Attach stainless steel safety cable to pump and roll out with rising main and drop cable. Attach safety cable end to bore cap allowing for the rising main to stretch., You can also use zip ties. Allow some slack for the rising main to stretch. I always tape the full length of the cable splice to the rising main to protect it. Allow a couple of metres extra drop cable to be doubled up and taped to the rising main below the bore cap. This might be required if the cable splice or motor need replacement at a later date.,, Feed the assembly down the hole, pay particular attention to preventing damage to the electric drop cable. The assembly should be suspended by the bore cap on top of the casing., Attach bore cap to vehicle with a sling and "D" shackle. Position roller over well. Position vehicle to allow the pump to be lowered into well. Drive vehicle toward well. Lower the last meter by hand if possible or allow the well cap to bump over roller and into position on the casing., Allow a few moments for the water to reach the surface.,,

 Redness and swelling is natural. Also, it may notice some pain the following days. This is normal. Don’t worry about these, but make sure you continue cleaning your piercing properly.
 If the painful inflammation continues, watch for discharge from the piercing. If it the discharge is green or yellow and smelly in nature, seek medical attention. This combination could mean infection., This bump can occur within a few days or months after the piercing. Not all bumps are infected but if they’re red and resemble a pimple with pus inside, they likely are. Pus is not always a sign of infection, but get it checked with a doctor just in case. DO NOT remove the piercing if it is suspected to be infected, as this traps the infection and will likely have to be drained. Always ask your doctor before removing jewellery of an infected piercing.

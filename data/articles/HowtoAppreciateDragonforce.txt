, If you just don't like these songs, its more possible that you won't like the not popular ones. Some of their "best songs" are:


Through the Fire and Flames
Soldiers of the Wasteland
Fields of Despair
The Flame of Youth
Fury of the Storm

, You will see that playing their music is no easy business. Look up some tutorials that Herman Li and Sam Totman have done.
 You can get the tabs for them at www.911tabs.com, or you can play the songs by ear. Now you will be able to appreciate that playing those tricky solos require tons of practice. If you play an instrument not used by DF, (neither guitar, bass, drums nor piano), try to make adaptations onto your instrument. You don't know just how fun it is to play "Fields of Despair" on an oboe.
, These guys are in constant touring, so you never know. You can look up at www.dragonforce.com . If you are close to one, make sure you go! Attending to a metal gig is a superb experience.
 They will most likely be happy to show you what their favourite DF songs are.
, Don't feel bad about looking up these guys on Wikipedia. Only real posers will call you a poser if you do this.

 As with human flus, the more dogs your pet is around, the greater his or her risk of being exposed to an infected dog and of catching the infection.


If you do attend these places (such as doggy daycare), it is wise to ask the owner what they are doing to prevent the spread of canine influenza.
If the owner is aware of it and cautious as to what dogs are allowed to enter (preventing those who are infected with canine influenza from attending), your dog's risk is much lower than if the owner is less cautious.;
, Serious cases may lead to severe respiratory symptoms including pneumonia. If you notice another dog exhibiting these signs or symptoms (such as at the dog park), keep your dog away from them and walk in another direction. Also avoid touching the infected dog yourself, as the germs could get on your hands and then be passed along to your dog.
 If this is you, always wash your hands after petting another dog. It is possible for another dog to be infected with canine influenza without showing visible symptoms. You could inadvertently be picking up the germs and passing them onto your dog when you pet him or her if you do not wash your hands after contact with other dogs.


Wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 30 seconds. Be sure to scrub all areas of your hands, including between your fingers.
 The vaccine consists of two doses given several weeks apart, and the cost is approximately $50 per shot (so a total of around $100). However, the vaccine does not cover for the more recent (and more prevalent) strain of canine influenza, which is H3N2. So your dog can still catch the flu even if he or she has been vaccinated.
 If your dog tests positive, the vet can then discuss treatment options to help your dog get better as quickly as possible.

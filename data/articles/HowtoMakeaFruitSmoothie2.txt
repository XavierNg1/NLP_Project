 Brew one cup of strong coffee, and allow it to cool to room temperature. When itâ€™s cool, use the coffee to fill ice cube trays and allow the ice to freeze overnight.To brew strong coffee, use 4 tablespoons (21.2 g) of coffee per cup of water., Put the milk in first. Cut the banana into one-inch (2.5 cm) chunks, and throw that in along with the coffee ice cubes. Then add the oats, followed by the remaining ingredients.The oats, flax, and spices are optional ingredients that make this smoothie more like a complete breakfast.
 Start on a low speed to allow the blender time to process the ice. As the ingredients get incorporated, gradually increase the speed until everything is smooth and creamy.


Serve in a tall glass or to-go cup for a healthy breakfast on the road.

 The Safari browser in Mac OS X Mavericks offers a streamlined way of accessing your bookmarks. Before anything else, launch your Safari browser, which should be on your desktop's dock at the bottom.


The Safari browser’s icon looks like a compass.
 It is at the right side of “History.” This should open the Bookmarks list in a full window, allowing you to see all your bookmarks on your Safari browser.
 To go to a bookmarked web page, double-click on the bookmark to open the web page in a new tab.

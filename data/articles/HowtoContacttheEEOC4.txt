You also can look at the map and browse the list of offices below it to find your nearest office. Each of the offices is linked.
The EEOC has 15 districts with a number of area, local, or field offices under them depending on the population of the district. For example, the Birmingham, Alabama district office covers the states of Alabama and Mississippi, and the Florida Panhandle. In addition to the district office, there is an area office in Jackson, Mississippi and a local office in Mobile, Alabama., Once you find the office nearest you, the office information page provides you with the address, phone and fax numbers of that particular office, as well as its hours of operation and when it takes walk-ins for intake evaluation.


For example, if you live in Nashville, Tennessee, you would file your charge in the Nashville area office. That office is open from 8:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, but only takes walk-ins through 2:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday and through 12:00 noon on Friday.You can either appear at the office as a walk-in, or call and schedule an appointment for an interview.

 One of the most common ways people take superfood powder is by adding them to smoothies. Some of the powders, like spirulina, have unpleasant tastes by themselves. Adding it to a fruit smoothie can help mask the flavor while providing additional nutrients.Make sure your smoothie is healthy. Add fresh fruits instead of canned or fruit in heavy syrup. If you want a dairy element, try Greek yogurt or low-fat milk. Donâ€™t add sugar-filled juices or ice cream.
 If you are into juicing, you may want to add the the superfood powder into your fresh juice. After juicing your fruits and vegetables, stir in your superfood powder. The taste of the powder should blend in with the taste of your juice.If you purchase juice, you can blend it in with that, too. Just make sure you are buying 100% natural juice without added sugars to get the most health benefits.
 Another way you can get your daily teaspoon or tablespoon of superfood powder is to sprinkle it over your meals and snacks. Try maca or acai powder over yogurt, or sprinkle some baobab over your cereal or oatmeal.You may want to try adding the powder to quinoa, sprinkling it on top of vegetables, or mixing it into your soups.
Some powders, such as spirulina, are delicious when sprinkled over fresh-popped popcorn. Popcorn is a whole grain, so if you prepare it without adding salt or fat (butter), it is a very healthy snack.

 If you prefer a sweeter coleslaw, add the full amount of honey called for in the recipe. If you prefer tangier coleslaw, cut the amount of honey called for in half.


Note that this alteration should not negatively impact the consistency of the dressing.
 Combine the mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, honey, poppy seeds, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and whisk together until well blended.


It should be fairly easy to tell when the dressing is well combined since the dressing should be evenly speckled with poppy seeds.
 Taste test the dressing using a clean spoon. Add more honey, salt, or pepper as needed to meet your preferences.


You could also alter the amount of mayo or vinegar used, but changing these ingredients around too much can have a dramatic impact on the consistency of the dressing.
 Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dressing until you are ready to combine it with your coleslaw mix.


Fold your coleslaw mix into the dressing, thoroughly coating all the vegetables with dressing.

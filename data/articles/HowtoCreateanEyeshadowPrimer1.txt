 Before you start, you need to find a little container to use for mixing your ingredients. You can clean out an old eye shadow pot and use that, but a Dixie cup, a contacts case, or any small container works fine. Just make sure it is thoroughly cleaned before you begin.;
, If you use powder foundation, you’ll need to invest in a liquid foundation for this recipe. However, you can use it on your face as well, so it’s money well spent! You can add as much of these products as you want, depending on the size of your container and how much you think you’ll use. Just remember to use the same amounts of both, and you will need to add the same amount of body butter as well.It’s best to stick with the foundation and concealer you use regularly, because you know it won’t cause an allergic reaction or a breakout.
 You can use facial lotion, but body butter works particularly well because it is thick and has a bit of staying power on your lids. If you choose to use a facial moisturizer, just look for one that is a bit thicker. Runny, lightweight lotions don’t work quite as well. Use a spoon or a knife to scoop out an amount of body butter equal to the amount of foundation you used. Because your eyelids are sensitive areas, test the lotion on a small patch of skin before using it in your primer.
 Aloe vera is know to decrease oil production in your skin.Excess oil on the eyelids is a major reason for smearing and fading throughout the day. By adding a little bit to your primer, you’ll be combating this problem.Make sure to buy 100% aloe vera gel. You can find this at your local pharmacy.
 You can use a spoon, a toothpick, or anything that fits inside your container. To apply your new homemade primer, simply rub a small amount into each eyelid. You can apply it directly with your fingertips. Seal the container and save the rest of your primer for later!

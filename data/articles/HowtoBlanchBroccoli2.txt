 Cut the broccoli down into consistently-sized florets for uniform cooking.
 Fill a large pot with 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of water and bring to a boil. Place your vegetables in a stem basket that sits above the water line. Cover the pot and prepare an ice water bath, as above.









Try to arrange the florets in a single layer to ensure the steam reaches all parts of the broccoli evenly.
 When steam begin to escape, begin counting your blanching time.









Steam blanching broccoli takes approximately 5 minutes.
About half-way through the cooking time, remove the lid and make sure the broccoli is not clumping together and that it is all cooking evenly.
 Once your broccoli has been blanched, remove the steam basket from the pot and immediately place the broccoli into the ice water bath.
 After the broccoli has cooled in the ice water, drain the broccoli in a colander and allow the florets to dry before eating or packing for freezing.

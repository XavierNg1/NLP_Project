 Two VOR receivers are best, but you can still identify an intersection with one VOR by switching the frequency and comparing the radials of both VORs.
 Use the OBS to set the correct radials from each VOR. The radials will be displayed on VFR and IFR charts if they are Victor airways, but any two intersecting radials may be used. On VFR charts, the arrows identifying the intersection point to the VOR, while the arrows on an IFR chart point from the VOR toward the intersection.
 While tracking the course on one VOR, watch the other VOR to see when the CDI centers. When both needles are centered, you are on the intersection.


If DME equipped and using a VOR/DME or VORTAC, use DME to eliminate the need for a second VOR. While tracking the VOR radial, use the DME to find your distance from the station. DME distances will be displayed on IFR charts when it can be used to identify an intersection. For example, WARIC intersection is defined by the 238 radial from the VOR and the 21 nm DME fix.

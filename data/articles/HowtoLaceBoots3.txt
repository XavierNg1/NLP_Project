 You want to use laces that are long enough for you boot height. Use the laces that came with your boots or get a pair that is at least as long as your original laces. The Ladder method is also sometimes known as straight across lacing, and is popular among US paratroopers for the security of firm lacing.This method works best on higher boots with a lot of eyelets.
 Start the laces the same way as for diagonal laces, running the laces underneath the bottom eyelet.


Your laces should now be on the outside of your boots.
 Now, instead of running your laces diagonally, run each end vertically through the next eyelet up. This time going from outside to in.


Your laces should now be on the inside of your boots.
 Run your lace under the section of lace that is connecting two eyelets vertically.You’re not threading your lace through an eyelet for this step as you are running the lace horizontally, not diagonally.
Instead of threading your lace through an eyelet, thread it through the section of vertical lace on the outside of your boot.
Do this for both ends of your laces. You should now have your laces on the outside of your boot.
 bring it up from underneath to the eyelet directly above the one below. Insert the lace from the outside in. Do this on both sides of you boot before bring running the lace horizontally across and under again.


Always follow the same order you started with. If you laced right over left first, continue in that order.
 Repeat this process until you have reached the top.


For this method, the only time your laces go through an eyelet is when you are moving to the eyelet vertically and from the outside in.
Once you are the top, your laces should be facing in, on the inside of your boots.
 Once you’ve laced all the way up, tie your boots in a bow, or a not and stuff the laces behind the tongue.

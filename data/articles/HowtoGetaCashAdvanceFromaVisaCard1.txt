When you take out a cash advance you are usually charged a one time fee and a very high interest rate that is higher than your interest rate on basic purchases. If at all possible, it may make more financial sense to avoid taking out cash advances.;

You don't need your PIN for everyday credit card transactions--only for making ATM withdrawals against your credit line. In some cases, you may have been allowed to set your own PIN number. If you cannot remember it, call your credit card company to retrieve it or log into your credit card account online to reset you PIN.
 Enter your PIN number when prompted, then select the amount of money you want to withdraw.


If the machine prompts you whether to make the withdrawal from checking, savings or credit, select "Credit."
Note that some ATM operators may charge a small fee for each transaction. Your credit card issuer might also charge you an extra fee, usually a percentage of the cash advance, for processing the transaction.
Protect yourself at the ATM, just as you would while using a debit card. Don't flash the cash or your credit card around, and don't let others see your PIN.

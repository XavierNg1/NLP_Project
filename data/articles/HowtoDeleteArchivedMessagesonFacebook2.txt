 The Facebook Messenger app doesn't allow you to access your archived messages, so you'll need to be on a computer to do so.


If you aren't already logged into Facebook, enter your Facebook email and password, then click "Log In".
 You'll find this in the top right section of your Facebook toolbar, between the "Friend Requests" and "Notifications" tabs; the Messages tab resembles two overlapping speech bubbles.
 This is at the bottom of the messages drop-down menu; clicking "See All" will take you to your message library.
 This is above your list of messages on the left side of the screen; clicking "More" will prompt a drop-down menu.
 This will open your Archived messages folder, from which you can delete your archived messages., You'll need to do this from the list of archived messages on the left side of your screen; doing so will bring up the message in the center of your screen.
 This will prompt a drop-down menu with options for your specific message.
 Facebook will prompt you for confirmation before complying with your request.


If you aren't quite ready to delete the conversation but don't want to receive notifications from it anymore, you can also click the "Mute Conversation" option here.
 This will permanently delete your conversation from your Messages folder!

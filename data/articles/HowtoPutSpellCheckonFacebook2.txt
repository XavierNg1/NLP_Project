If not yet signed in, enter your account details on the allocated text fields and click the “Sign In” button to proceed to your account.
 Click the Update Status text field at the very top of the page and start typing in the status that you want to post.
 Make a right-click on the Status Update text field and select “Check Spelling” from the pop-out menu. You’ll see a check mark beside this option when the Mozilla Firefox’s Spell-Check tool is active.


Every time you misspell a word, a red line will appear below it telling you that the word is wrongfully spelled.
 To correct the spelling, right-click on the underlined word and a list of possible correct choices will appear. Select one of the suggested words from the list and it will replace the one that you misspelled.

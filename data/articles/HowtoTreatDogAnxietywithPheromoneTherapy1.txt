 Pheromones can be used for a variety of behavioral issues related to anxiety but they cannot treat all of them. In particular, pheromones are not very useful for treating aggression issues.If your dog is having a hard time dealing with separation from you, coping with loud noises, or meeting other people or pets, then trying pheromone therapy is a good idea.
Additionally, if your dog has general anxiety that is not caused by a specific medical problem, for instance they pace and are restless at night, then pheromone therapy may relieve some of their anxiety.;
, If you are considering using pheromones on your dog you should discuss it with your veterinarian first. Your veterinarian may have suggestions for if and when pheromones should be used, as well as suggestions for what specific brands to use on your dog.


Having your veterinarian suggest a brand of pheromones to use can be very helpful, as there are many products available and choosing one can be difficult.
Pheromone products for dogs are sold over the counter. You will not need to get them directly from your veterinarian.However, it is a good idea to discuss any veterinary treatment you are planning on giving your dog with its veterinarian.
 You should get your dog's anxiety assessed by the veterinarian before using pheromones. Anxiety can have medical causes, so it's a good idea to have your dog looked over for medical issues that could be causing bad behavior.For example, if your dog has joint pain, it may cause it some distress that looks a lot like general anxiety. This pain can cause restlessness and difficulty sleeping. If the pain is managed, then the anxiety may go away.

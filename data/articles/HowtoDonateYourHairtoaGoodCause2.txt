 Go to the salon where you plan on getting your hair cut and be sure to tell them that your hair is going to be donated. They will first measure your hair to make sure it's the required length, and will then put your hair in a loose ponytail or two braids.


Your hair will be cut right above the ponytail rings, and the stylist can not let the hair touch the floor. Your hair must be dry before tying it with a rubber band and placing it in an air-tight plastic bag.
 Mail or give it, in person, to an organization that specializes in making wigs for cancer patients. Be happy that you have helped a cause. Consider regrowing it to help again next year.


Make sure you have the required postage! Take it to your local post office, obtain a padded envelope, and they'll help you out from there.
 Hair is needed from men and women of all ages and races. Let your friends know what you're up to and perhaps they'll be inspired to help, too.


An estimated 80% of donations come from children looking to help other children.If you know someone who might be interested, let them know how easy the process was and how good it feels to help.

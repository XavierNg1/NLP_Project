 When you love all of the people in your wedding party, it can be hard to choose just one maid of honor and best man. Of all of these people, your maid of honor and best man should be the people to whom you and your partner feel the closest.


However, no one can blame you for choosing a family member. If you can’t choose between two of your best friends, you can pick your sister to diffuse potential tension.
Even if you were one of your bridesmaids’ maid of honor, do not feel like you need to choose her to be your maid of honor. It’s your wedding, and ultimately the choice is yours., The maid of honor and best man are typically responsible for planning events like bridal showers and bachelor parties. They also have the responsibility of planning and organizing for you and making sure that you have everything you need on the day of the wedding. If you want your sister to be your maid of honor but she’s really busy or disorganized, you could ask someone else in the bridal party to plan your bridal shower or your bachelorette party. The bridesmaid will probably be honored by the extra duty and will want to help in any way she can.
 Make sure that, before your maid of honor or best man agrees to the task, they know what they’re responsible for. Many people would be excited to plan your bachelorette party for you, but siblings in graduate school or friends across the country might not have the logistical time or ability to do these things for you.


Have a conversation with your potential maid of honor or best man where you outline the responsibilities for the position. Make sure that the person is enthusiastic about whatever the responsibilities are.

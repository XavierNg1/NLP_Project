 Dust your rugs and carpets evenly with baking soda. Use as much as you deem necessary, depending on the smell’s strength. For a quick job, allow the baking soda to absorb odors for at least a quarter of an hour (or longer if you have the time) before vacuuming. For a more thorough freshening, declare the area off-limits for the next 24 hours and then vacuum it the following day.
 Dust the bottom of your garbage can and/or the inside of your trash liner to counteract stinky garbage. Rinse the old baking soda out with each change of the bag and reapply.Be careful not to set the old garbage bag on your floor, since it will be powdered with baking soda. However, you can clean your floor easily with a wipe of a cloth or a quick vacuum, so don’t stress out too much about it.

Alternately, you can leave a full opened box of baking soda at the bottom of the can to avoid messy bag-changes.
 Dust the bottom of the tray with baking soda for additional odor-absorption. Then fill it with your store-bought cat litter. Alternately, you can create your own litter by filling the tray with three inches of sandy clay and then stirring in an 8-ounce box of baking soda. For especially strong odors, use a 16-ounce box., Shake some baking soda over your wet pet to reduce “wet fur” and other smells when you don’t have time to give them a full bath with shampoo. Keep it light to avoid startling them with a thick cloud, or simply pour some in your palm and rub it into their fur if that is easier. Work it in with your fingers so it can trap the odors. Then use your pet’s brush to comb the baking soda out.

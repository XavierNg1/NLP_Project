 iOS 9 introduced the ability to add attachments from iCloud and other cloud storage services. You can attach any type of file, including photos and videos.
 Your attachment will be included in-line in the body. Whether or not it appears in-line or at the bottom of the message depends on the recipient's mail client.
 You'll see a few options appear above the cursor.
 This will display some additional options. You won't need to do this on an iPad, as all of the options fit on the screen.
 A new window will appear, displaying the contents of your iCloud Drive.
 You can attach any image file that you have stored on your iCloud Drive. Simply tap a file to attach it to your message.
 You can also search through other major cloud storage services, if you've installed them on your device already. You can use Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and Box.
 After attaching the image file, you can continue to send the message as you normally would. Your recipient will get the file as a regular attachment.

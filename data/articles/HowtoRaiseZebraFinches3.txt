 Finches are vegetarian, and in the wild, their diet consists of grain, vegetation, and seeds. You can purchase bird seed mixes at a pet store. Buy it in small quantities in sealed boxes or containers. This is more likely to keep the freshness and vitamins intact. Avoid buying food from giant hoppers. These expose food to air, and given the large size of the hopper, the food is less than fresh and likely to be depleted in nutrition., A finch will regulate its diet to suit its needs, and therefore, it will not overeat. Ensure that the bird's seed feeder is constantly filled.


The exception, however, are sunflower seeds, which are delicious but also high in fat. A finch knows no self-control around sunflower seeds and could become obese, so save these for a rare treat. , Finches can also eat basic household foods such as vegetables and breadcrumbs. Avoid meats and spicy/sweet foods.


Remove any untouched perishable food daily.
 Give your finches two different areas to drink water. Try an open dish, which is the type that typically comes with the cage. Also use a clear drinker, which is a bottle that attaches to the side of the cage. This type has a spout or mini-dish at the bottom that the birds can drink from.This will train the finches to drink from different types of water sources. This is important in case you give your birds to someone else. If the new owner doesnâ€™t use the same type of water dispenser that you used, the bird may not know how to drink. It can easily become dehydrated in this case.
Change the water every day to ensure that it is clean and fresh.
 Cuttle-bones are taken from cuttlefish and provide minerals like iron and calcium for your bird. Your bird will dig his beak into the soft side of the cuttlebone to get the calcium. This action will also keep his beak in good shape.

 There are 2 basic kinds of Turkish carpets: a kilim or a knotted carpet.


Choose a kilim for a less expensive alternative. A kilim is a flexible, woven rug that can be folded. It has no backing, and can be used as a furniture covering, blanket, wall hanging or rug. Kilims often are made from cotton fibers using a flatweaving technique.
Choose a hand-knotted carpet for a higher quality rug. Made of wool or silk, handwoven Turkish rugs are single or double knotted onto a firm backing.;

Choose handmade Turkish rugs for the high quality weaving and unique story each carpet offers. Artisans create rug designs that share part of their own life stories. Handmade rugs are hand-knotted and, depending on the size, can take years to complete.
Choose commercially manufactured Turkish rugs for design control. Customers can dictate the colors, styles and patterns displayed in commercially manufactured rugs. If you are tied to a particular color palette or design, consider purchasing a commercially made Turkish carpet.
 Before shopping for a Turkish rug, measure the room or area where the rug will be displayed. In most cases, the measurements should allow for a border of flooring to show along the perimeter of the rug.


Consider several different sizes for each room. Areas like dining rooms, hallways and entryways may not allow for many sizing options. However, in living rooms and bedrooms you may be able to utilize several carpet sizes based on different furniture arrangements in the rooms. The more sizes you are willing to consider, the more choices you will have when purchasing a Turkish carpet.
Understand the typical Turkish rug dimensions. Handcrafted Turkish rugs vary in size. However, many rug weavers use the following carpet dimensions: Yastik is 60 by 90 cm (23.6 by 35.4 inches); Ceyrek is 90 by 135 cm (34.5 by 53.1 inches); Kisa Yolluk is 70 by 200 cm (27.6 by 78.7 inches); Seccade is 120 by 180 cm (47.2 by 70.9 inches); Saf 110 by 230 cm (43.3 by 90.6 inches); Karyola is 150 by 230 cm (59 by 90.6 inches); Kelle is 300 by 200 cm (118.1 by 78.7 inches); and Taban is 6 m x 6 m (19.7 x 19.7 feet).
 Turkish rugs can range in price from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. The carpet's size, age, design and quality factor into the sales price. The higher the quality, the more expensive the carpet.

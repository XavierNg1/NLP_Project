 Instead of crossing over in between yourself and the defender, which can be tricky and dangerous, bounce the ball behind your back to shift directions. This uses your body to shield the ball, and can leave defenders in your dust.









Practice dribbling behind your back before trying this move. You can't see where the ball is going, so it can be a difficult maneuver to pull off.
 Another effective shielding technique is to dribble the ball between your legs. Most typically, you'd dribble back through your non-dominant leg, catching the ball with that hand, but you can improvise in all sorts of ways.









Try going back to front, from your non-dominant side to your dominant side as your hesitation maneuver, fake toward that dominant side and abruptly cross it back over between your legs again.
 If you've gone to the well one too many times and your defender catches you in the act by staying centered when you try your crossover, kick the ball back into your dominant hand and drive in the direction you tried to fake. This double crossover will often go so far as to trip up the defender, leading to this move's reputation as the "ankle-breaker."








, Try different combinations of between the legs and directional shifts to improve your offensive game. The simple crossover is really just a quick dribble, but when you've mastered that and can effectively crossover, your offensive game will only be limited by your imagination.

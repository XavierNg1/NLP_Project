 Even a high-quality sleeping bag placed directly on the cold earth will not prevent you from feeling the chill. You can buy insulated sleeping mats (which have an R-value like home insulation panels) to place beneath you, or use rugs, mats, blankets, etc.If you’re using an air mattress, insulate beneath it as well.
If you’re using a camping bed, place bags, clothing, supplies, etc. beneath it to limit the flow of chilly air underneath you.
 But keep your head outside the bag. You might think that breathing warm air into the bag would be a good idea, but you’ll end up adding cold-conducting moisture and reducing your fresh air intake. Use the flaps or cinches on your bag to make a secure (but comfortable) seal around your neck.

Wear a knit hat that covers your ears to keep your head warm., Make sure you use a sturdy, well-maintained tent that is secure in the ground and free of holes or tears. If the tent fails in the middle of a cold night, you could be in serious trouble. The tent should limit cold drafts, yet allow some small amount of ventilation to prevent moisture buildup and provide fresh air.Choose the smallest tent that will (relatively) comfortably fit the number of people sleeping inside. This will hold in your body warmth better., If you expose your tent to cold breezes by placing it, for instance, on an exposed hilltop, everything inside it (including you) will end up colder. At the same time, though, cold air descends to low ground, so avoid sheltered valleys as well.Consider placing your tent under the canopy of a sturdy tree. The tree will shield your tent from some of the wind, and will retain some radiant heat from the daylight hours well into the evening. Choose a spot where you won’t be shielded from the rising (and warming) sun in the morning, though.

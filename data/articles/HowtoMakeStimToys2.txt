 There are plenty of phone cases and plastic decorative items available online, at craft stores, and in other locations. Choose a hard, solid-colored or clear case. For decorations, choose items that have interesting textures and appearances. You can find tiny velvet animals, mini mirrors, fabric patches, and anything else that is small enough to fit on a phone case. Since this is on your phone, you probably will not be chewing it, so don't worry about paint or small parts.
 You can lay down newspaper, printer paper, saran wrap, or any other material that will prevent glue from getting on your table.
 You should have a hard plastic phone case that is not flexible. To remove any dust or fingerprints, wipe the phone case with rubbing alcohol. You can use cotton balls dampened with rubbing alcohol or premade alcohol wipes. After this, leave the case flat on the table and do not touch it with your skin.
 You can find your own decorations or buy decoden cabochons online that are made just for phone cases. Wipe the backs of the decorations with rubbing alcohol to clean them, and then place them on the phone case without glue to plan where you want them to stay.
Â There are many types of glue available for plastic, and they come in several colors. Some choices include Fuwa Fuwa, Whipple Decorating Creme, E6000 Craft Adhesive, and others. If you have a latex allergy or similar condition, check the glue ingredients before using. Once you are ready, add the decorative pieces to the back of your phone case.
 Check the glue instructions for drying time. When your case is done drying, put it on your phone and enjoy a convenient tactile toy!

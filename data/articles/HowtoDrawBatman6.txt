 This will serve as the outer border of the logo if you choose to render the chest emblem with the oval and as a guide for the bat if you don't. The oval should be about as long as the distance between the ends of the Dark Knight's eyeslits., The space will form a border for the emblem. If you don't plan to include the oval in the logo, ignore this step.,, Until 1969, the bat was drawn with slightly curving lines radiating from the bat's head to form the peaks of the wings, which then curved down to the outer tips. After that point, the outer edges of the wings curled to resemble the edges of a 2-headed ax. Using the reference lines, draw in one half of the Bat-symbol, then draw the other half as its mirror image.,

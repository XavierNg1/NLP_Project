 You can use a blank sheet of regular paper or a patterned piece of paper. But make sure it measures 11 inches on one side., Use the long end of the piece of paper and fold a half inch wide strip. Rip or cut the strip.


If you are doing traditional origami, you will fold and rip the paper.
You want the strip to be a half inch wide and 11 inches long.
 To do this, bend one end of the strip, close to the top so the strip looks like a ribbon, with two ends and a loop.The short end should be over the long end.
 Don’t scrunch the paper as you pull the knot tight. Keep the paper smooth., You should now have a pentagon shape, with one short end sticking out and one long end sticking out.
 Valley fold means fold the paper towards you. Tuck the short end into the pentagon so it does not show anymore.


You should be able to do this without scissors, but if you left your short end a bit too long, snip it shorter with scissors.
Start over with a new strip of paper if you have to snip off more than a ½ inch on the short side.
 Valley fold the long end along the edge of the pentagon. It should fall across the front of the pentagon.
 Valley fold the long end along the pentagon again. Use the edge of the pentagon to line up the fold.
 The pentagon should get fatter and fatter as you flip and fold.
 Tuck this short end into the pentagon, just like you did with the first short end.


You should now have a perfect little paper pentagon.
 Hold it lightly with your fingers along two of the edges. Push four of the edges with the tip of your thumbnail. The star should begin to inflate.Rotate the star and push on the remaining side to completely inflate the star.
Enjoy your mini origami star!

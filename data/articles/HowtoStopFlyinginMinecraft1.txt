 Flying is only possible in Minecraft's Creative mode. There is no way to fly in survival mode.


Some third-party mods may allow you to fly outside of Creative mode. The controls used for these mods will vary, so if you're using a mod, consult your mod's website for more information.;
, To stop flying, first you need to be flying to begin with. When you're on the ground, you can start flying at any time by double-tapping the jump key.


On the computer version of Minecraft, this will be the space bar by default. Other versions of the game have different controls. A few examples are as follows:Minecraft PE: On-screen square jump button
Minecraft for Xbox 360/One: A button
Minecraft for Playstation 3/4: X button

, You should immediately start falling downward as if you had walked off a ledge. When you hit the ground, you will be walking normally again. Whenever you wish, you can double-jump to start flying once more.
 Flying is only possible in the game's Creative mode. In this mode, the player is invincible to all damage (including fall damage).While a fall from a great height would normally kill the player unless it was into water, you don't have to worry about this in Creative mode, so feel free to stop flying even when you're nowhere near the ground.

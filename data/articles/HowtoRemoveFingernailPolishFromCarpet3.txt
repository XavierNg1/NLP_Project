 When the nail polish stain is gone, press a clean towel or cloth into the carpet. This will soak up leftover polish residue and excess nail polish remover or cleaner.









Use fresh towels or a new section of the same towel often. Keep pressing into the carpet until all the excess residue has been removed and the towel comes away dry., Fill a small bucket with water and add 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 ml) of liquid dish detergent, laundry soap, or carpet cleaner. Swish the water around to dissolve the soap and work up some suds. Dip a clean sponge into the soapy water, wring out the excess, and scrub the carpet to clean off residue.








Rinse out the sponge regularly in the soapy water, and continue scrubbing until the smell of nail polish remover or cleaner has dissipated.

 Your dining table is in place, chairs are pushed in, and the table is set. The only thing remaining to complete the picture is the center piece, your light fixture. This lighting fixture is the focal point of your room, so it needs to express your own personal style, while still satisfying general lighting needs. Whether your dining and entertaining style is casual and laid back, or is generally more formal, choose a fixture that reflects you.
 Both fixtures are excellent sources of lighting and are sure to set the tone of your dining room. Recessed wall washers can also provide additional light while helping to create an illusion of a larger room space.


When hanging a chandelier, make sure that the chandelier is 6" to 12" smaller than the narrowest side of the table. The bottom of the pendant or chandelier should be approximately 30" above your table.
Chandeliers with 200 to 400 overall wattage provide abundant illumination for a dining room.
Consider a chandelier with an integral downlight for additional light on the table.
 Aim adjustable halogen recessed fixtures on the table and chandelier. This will provide additional light on the table, and will also bring out the brilliance of the chandelier. Consider companion sconces on either side of a china cabinet or hutch. Cabinet lighting mounted inside valences and cabinets also adds drama.

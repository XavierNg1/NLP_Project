, If your canoe is already in good shape, but just needs a sanding/painting job, skip this step.
 Apply fiberglass gelcoat, let it dry until the product recommends and then sand the gelcoat to obtain a smooth surface with a 60-80 grit sanding sponge or by hand with normal sanding sheet.
 If these aren't really deep, don't bother filling those, as the paint will cover it up beautifully.
 Do this gently, carefully and just enough to remove the old surface paint completely.
 Wash it up with the hose gently, and use the cheesecloth to wipe off all the dust on the canoe.
 Prepare a nice working space inside your garage or outside (far from trees or dust, and get this done before 11 am to let it dry all day before the night). Then, cover up your canoe border with the painting tape, be really precise.
 They say maximum 10% thinner, but 4-5% is highly recommended.
 You will obtain a fairly liquid type of paint because of the thinner. And, when you apply the paint, it will cause a lot of small bubbles. Don't panic, though! Just keep rolling on the bubbles until they vanish and continue on the next area of the canoe.
, Be gentle.

Escherichia coli, which causes intestinal dysbacteriosis and urinary infections.
Salmonella typhi, which causes typhoid, and other Salmonella genus that cause severe intestinal afflictions.
Shigella dysenteriae, which causes bacillus dysentery.
Staphylococcus and streptococcus, which causes furuncles (infected blemishes) and other skin infections.
Diverse types of fungi, yeasts, and some viruses, such as herpes.;

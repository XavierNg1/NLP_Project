Using a sharp pencil, lightly draw an oval shape for squidward's head.



Create two vertical ovals that are a bit longer than the head.



Draw another vertical oval between the eyes to create his signature nose.



Draw a frown a little above the middle of the nose.



Draw a straight line under both the eyes and go around the mouth by drawing a C.



Draw three curved lines on the forehead then draw rectangles in each eye for the pupil.



Erase any mistakes with a good quality eraser and outline the drawing with a marker or pen to make it really pop out.



Colour the skin turquoise, his pupils red, and his eyes yellow, you can also add highlights and shadows to make your drawing look even more amazing.

 Take time to acknowledge what’s bothering you. Is it an unwanted thought, memory, or image? Is it someone else’s annoying habit? Whatever it is, before you ignore it and move on you first have to know what it is that’s bothering you and why.


Keep in mind that some things can be detrimental to ignore, such as medical symptoms or a coworker stealing your project ideas., Accept that you cannot control other people, events, or situations. Rather, you can only control your reactions to them. Remember that you getting annoyed about something will not change the fact that it’s happening, so why bother wasting the energy?


Some people find the Serenity Prayer useful for this. You can say, "Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."

, When you’re trying to ignore something and it pops into your head, try to develop a phrase to say to yourself that will replace your unwanted negative thought. It's helpful to replace unwanted thoughts with something more positive and affirming. Some things you might say include:“I'll give it another try, I can do this."
“You've got this."
"Keep going."

, Instead of paying attention to anything negative or annoying in your environment, try to stop and smell the roses. You might not be able to completely ignore the bad things, but you can retrain your brain to focus more on the good things. Try to do this a few times each day and you’ll notice a difference in your mood.For example, take time to notice how nice the weather is outside. Enjoy the feeling and savor the moment for at least 10 seconds. Just relax into the feeling.

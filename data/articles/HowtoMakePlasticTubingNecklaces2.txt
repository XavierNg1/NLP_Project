 Instead of haphazardly throwing a bunch of filling into the tube, thinking about how you want the necklace to appear and what look you hope to achieve. Perhaps draw the design on paper.
 This should be done based on personal preference and overall fashion goals.


Use other necklaces to help you determine the length of your necklace. While other necklaces won’t lay the same way, using other pieces of jewelry as your guide can give you somewhat of an idea of how long you’d like the tubing to be.
Remember that plastic tubing does not lay the same way as chains or pearls so keep that in mind when styling longer necklaces.
 Slide the thin, metal nail through the top of the cord end with the head portion facing the bottom.


Cut the thin metal nail approximately 1 inch (2.5cm) from the top once it’s fully threaded through the cord end. Use wire cutters if your scissors can’t cut through the metal.
Bend the metal nail backward and into the top of the cord end so you create a loop.
 This will provide a barrier at the end and prepare the tube for filling.


Allow the glued cord end ample amount of time to dry before filling. If it is still wet, the cord end could become unglued after being filled, creating a mess.
 This may take some time as you will want to be neat and tidy when adding glitter or stones.


Consider using a small funnel to guide filling neatly into the plastic tubing. If you don’t own a small funnel, simply create one from a piece of paper by rolling it sideways and then placing the smaller end into the top of the tube.
 This time you may want to add a clasp. The easiest way to add the clasp is to slide it through the cord end loop as you create it. Before you bend the thin metal nail backwards to create the loop, slide the clasp through the nail and then bend the nail into the loop.

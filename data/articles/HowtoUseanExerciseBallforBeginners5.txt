 Place the exercise ball between yourself and the wall, at your lower back.
 The distance you step forward depends on the length of your legs.
 Your knees should be in line with your ankles and your thighs parallel to the floor.


If your knees extend over your ankles, or are behind your ankles, adjust the position of your feet.
 Push back up to standing. Repeat the squat at least 10 times.

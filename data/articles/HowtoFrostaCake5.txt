 Use a contrasting color of icing to pipe stripes across the top of your cake in even rows. Then, take a long toothpick and make even lines perpendicular to the ones you just piped. Make every-other line in the opposite direction. This will create a lovely marbled or feathered appearance to the top of your cake., Use your traditional cake piping bag with different tips to add pretty designs to the top of your cake. You can create a repetitive pattern, writing, or small shapes with a piping bag. If you donâ€™t have a piping bag, try using a traditional ziploc bag with the tip cut off., Purchase or make your own colored fondant - a sugar based dough-like frosting that can be shaped and spread for seamless application. Coat your entire cake in a layer of fondant, or use it to form small figures and details to place on top of your cake., Once you have completely frosted your cake, add fresh flowers for a fresh appearance. Fresh flowers give the appearance of a lot of effort, but are an incredibly simple addition to your cake., You can choose to use real ribbons for a satiny look or create strips of ribbon out of fondant to add to the border. Ribbons are especially effective on a cake with several tiers, such as a wedding cake.

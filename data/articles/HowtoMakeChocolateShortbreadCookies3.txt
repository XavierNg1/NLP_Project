 Make sure that your oven has preheated for at least fifteen minutes. Then place the two trays of cookies into the oven, putting one tray on the top rack and the other tray on the bottom rack., Leave the cookie trays in the oven for about ten minutes. Then switch the trays, putting the top cookie tray on the bottom rack and putting the tray that was on the bottom rack on the top rack. Switching the trays ensures even baking., After you switch the trays, keep the cookies in the oven for another ten to fifteen minutes. Test if the cookies are done by poking a fork through a cookie. If the fork comes out clean, take the cookies out of the oven., After you take the cookies out of the oven, let them sit for about five minutes on the cooking tray. Then use a spatula to carefully lift each cookie off the tray and place it on a wire rack.If you donâ€™t have a wire rack, lift the cookies up by the parchment paper and place them on the counter so that they cool faster.
 If you wish, sprinkle each cookie with cocoa powder before you serve them. Sprinkling the cookies with cocoa powder gives them an extra element of flavor., Once the cookies have settled, about 20-30 minutes, serve them and enjoy! Letting the cookies set for a little while helps them achieve the right texture.


Store any leftover cookies in an airtight container. Cookies in a sealed container can last for up to 1 week.

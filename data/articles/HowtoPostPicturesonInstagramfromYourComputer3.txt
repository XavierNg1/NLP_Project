 Dropbox is a cloud storage service that allows you to quickly share files between devices. You'll still need to use your Android device with this method, but it is a quick and easy way to get multiple photos from your computer onto Instagram without having to sync your device to your computer.


A free Dropbox account will give you 2 GB of storage, which should be sufficient for transferring images.
 Do this through the Dropbox website or by downloading the Dropbox app for Windows or Mac. See this guide for more information on adding files to your Dropbox storage.
 You can get the free Dropbox app from the Google PlayStore. The app will allow you to access your Dropbox storage from your mobile device.


The Instagram app must also be installed on your mobile device.
Dropbox for iPhone or iPad does not support Instagram connectivity.

 Tap the photo you want to share on Instagram.
 It's a downward-pointing caret in the upper-right corner.
 It's near the middle of the share menu.
 This launches the Instagram app. Follow the prompts to crop, edit, caption, and post as your normally would.

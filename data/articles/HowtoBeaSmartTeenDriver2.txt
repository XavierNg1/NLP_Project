 When you first get into your car, make a habit of putting on your seatbelt. Also, don’t let any of your passengers ride with you unless they wear their seat belts. Since it is your vehicle, make it your responsibility to protect everyone inside of it.Don’t allow more people in your car than the number of open seat belts.
 Look for the posted signs and stick to the limit. Keep an eye on your speedometer closely to make sure that you stay on target. Going over the speed limit cuts down your reaction time and is a huge risk factor for accidents., Flip on your signal with plenty of time in advance before turning or changing lanes. This gives other drivers enough time to react before you make any moves. When you are finished turning or changing lanes, then turn it back off., Passing can be one of the most critical skills that new drivers must master. Take your time when deciding to pass and make sure that you’ve fully cleared the other car before moving back into the lane. Keep to the speed limit when passing, but try to speed up a bit so that you don’t hang out in their blind spot.Don’t make a move to pass: if there isn’t enough space; if the line is solid yellow; if there is a blind spot, like a hill, ahead; if there is a tunnel ahead; or if there is road construction being completed.
 Just because you are committed to following the law doesn’t mean that others drivers will. Don’t assume that other people on the road are good drivers. Instead, watch other drivers carefully and take your time before making a move. If you see an aggressive driver, try to get far away from them as quickly as you can.For example, don’t assume that another driver will actually make a turn based on them using their turn signal. Wait until they’ve actually completed their turn before making your move.

 Remember that even if you make a mistake, it is unlikely that it will seem as big a mistake (if they see it as one at all) to the person you admire. When getting ready to meet someone, talk the negative thoughts down, and remind yourself that it is extremely unlikely that the worst, or even something very bad will happen when you meet the person you like., A lot of times we get nervous around our heroes or crushes because we’ve built them into something they’re not. They aren’t perfect, but they are human. They’ll do some things better than you, but it is just as likely that you will have some skills they don’t. Remember to value their contributions, as well as your own., Staying in the moment can help you keep perspective, as it allows you to forget what the moment will look like to your friends, or to think the worst of any mistakes. Taking the interaction moment by moment will help you listen, as well as say what you want to say.

 If your lawn mower has sat unused for more than a couple of months (and especially if it’s sat for an entire winter), the gasoline in the tank may have gone bad. Drain this gasoline and dispose of it safely. Then fill the lawn mower tank with fresh gasoline.If the mower’s gas tank doesn’t have a drain plug, you may need to use a length of hose and siphon the gas from the tank.
 If the spark plug in the lawn mower engine is wet with liquid or gasoline, the mower will not successfully start. Remove the spark plug, and clean it using carburetor cleaner and a damp rag. The solvent in the carburetor cleaner will cut through and remove any oil residue that may be stuck on the spark plug. Then let the spark plug dry before reinserting it into the lawn mower engine.If you need assistance opening the engine or finding the spark plug, you can refer to the lawn mower manual, which should contain a diagram of the engine.
You can purchase carburetor cleaner at a local auto supply store.
 The air filter keeps dust and grass bits from entering your mower’s engine. If the lawn mower’s air filter has become excessively dirty or flooded with gasoline, the machine won’t start properly. The air filter will either be a paper filter (housed in a small cylinder) or a foam-type filter (housed in a sardine-can sized metal rectangle). Remove their air filter and inspect it: if the filter is clogged or dirty, you may need to replace it. This will allow the engine to get enough air and start properly.If you’re unsure of the air filter’s location, refer to the lawn mower manual. This should provide a diagram with the location of the air filter and other engine components.
You can purchase a new lawn mower air filter at your local hardware store. Air filters may also be sold at an auto parts store, or at a large retailer like WalMart.

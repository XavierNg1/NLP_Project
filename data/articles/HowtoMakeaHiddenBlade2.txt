 Cut a length of cardboard so that it's the size and shape of a blade that will fit within the ball bearing track. The end of the "blade" should align with the end of the track. Make two holes in the cardboard that align with the holes you drilled in the ball bearing track.
 Trace the cardboard blade cutout onto a piece of sheet metal, including the two holes in the middle. Cut the blade shape from the metal and drill two holes in the middle.
 The screws will be too long, so you'll need to cut them down by about half using the dremel.
 Place the ball bearing track upside down on your table, so that the ridge parts are facing down and the flat side is up. Lay the blade on top of the ball bearing track so that the screw holes are aligned. Thread screws through the holes and keep them in place with the nuts.
 Insert it so that the blade is pointing toward the pinched end of the tier. The ball bearing track should slide in easily; make sure all the ball bearings are in their correct place.
 Place the spring over the second screw on the blade. Now replace the black cap and screw it on tight, holding it in place with a nut. This will hold the whole contraption together.
 Lay the tier against your forearm and cut a length of fishing line that extends from the second screw on the blade to your middle finger. Make sure it's long enough to wrap around your finger while your hand is in a fist, and add a little extra to make sure you can tie it around a key ring. Tie one end of the line over the second screw, making sure to slip it over the nut so it will stay in place, and tie the other end around a key ring.









Make sure the fishing line is cut to the right length. It shouldn't be too taut, but if it's too loose it won't work. When the ring is around your middle finger and your fist is closed, the line should be snug. When you open your hand, it should pull the blade out.
Move the line back and forth to test whether the blade moves easily along the track.

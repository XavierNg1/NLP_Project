 It is rare for an individual undergoing a psychotic episode to become violent, although it can happen. Psychotic individuals are at a greater risk of harming themselves.Any threats of violence, self-harm, or suicide should be taken seriously.


A history of drug and alcohol abuse increases the likelihood of the psychotic individual becoming violent.
 If at any point you suspect the person might be dangerous, either to themselves or to others, call for help immediately. Consider calling an ambulance or other medical experts specifically—if there’s no time to look up phone numbers, just call 911.


If you’re in a room with a dangerous psychotic individual, leave the room immediately.
If police arrive on the scene, try to explain the situation before they interact directly with the person experiencing the psychotic episode. Without interfering and endangering yourself or others, encourage officers to remain calm and resolve the situation without the use of force., If the person is dangerous to him- or herself, remove any sharp objects and dangerous materials from the person and from the room, and lock any un-barred windows and balconies. Try to keep the person calm. Call the police or an ambulance if there’s a chance the person will attempt suicide or cause themselves serious physical damage.


Speak to the individual calmly, and try to de-escalate the situation. If the psychotic individual is asking for things or making demands, comply with those that are safe and reasonable., If the psychotic individual is acting violent or threatening violence, don’t take it on yourself to solve the problem. You could risk personal harm, especially if you try to engage in a physical struggle with the psychotic individual.


Your main priority should be keeping yourself and others safe. If you can do things to protect the psychotic individual (e.g. removing a knife from a nearby table top), make sure to keep yourself safe while doing so.

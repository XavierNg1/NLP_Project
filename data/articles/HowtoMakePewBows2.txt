 You'll need some wired ribbon, some tulle, scissors, and twist ties.
 Use your scissors to cut two to three feet lengths of both the wired ribbon and the tulle. Set these bow tails aside.
 Follow the loop making process to make 8 to 12 loops out of the wired ribbon. Make sure to hold the bow in the center while you do this, and try to keep the loops about the same length.
 Wrap a twist tie around the center of the ribbon bow and twist it tight so that the bow keeps its shape.
 Fold the length of ribbon to be used for a tail in half, and place the center against the center of the bow. Then undo the twist tie and redo it with the tail attached to the center of the bow.

 Fold the length of ribbon to be used for a tail in half, and place the center against the center of the bow. Then undo the twist tie and redo it with the tail attached to the center of the bow.

 Copy the address for the video. Search for an internet video downloader. There are several that work directly from the browser and only require a Java applet to run; they don’t need to be installed. These sites will convert the video to the format of your choice.;
, In order to play the video on iOS, you will need to download the video in the .mp4 format. The other formats available will not work. For Android OS, most of the available video types will work, though some may require a video player app to be installed.
 Since you will be viewing on a small screen, you most likely do not need to download the highest quality files. Quality is denoted by a number with a “p” next to it (240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, etc.). The higher the number, the better the quality. Strike a balance between quality and size, especially if space is an issue on the phone.

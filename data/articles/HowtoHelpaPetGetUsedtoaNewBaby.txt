 This may scare away the pet if they're not used to new things or people or may have a negative reaction. If the pet is territorial about the baby being brought into the family, the bonding between the pet and baby will be more difficult and longer to attempt.
 If there's a blanket or toy around, don't shoo the pet away. The sniffing lets the pet adapt to the scent of the child and gives them their own opportunity to learn more about the baby in their own way., If the pet is still intimidated, stay away at a safe distance. Use a baby-soothing voice around the both of them. Ask the baby, "Whose that?" and "Is that the ______Â ?" (depending what pet it is. Use "child" words, for example "doggy" or "kitty" instead of dog or cat. If you use a calm voice with the baby, he/she will develop a calm sense around the pet instead of being hyper., Don't let the baby touch the pet at this time, but let them observe with their eyes. This method will make the baby feel comfortable around the pet in a non-interaction way., Patience is the key:

If there is no difference, keep trying to introduce the two of them.
If there seems to be a negative reaction, it's best to keep the pet away from the child until the pet is confident and ready to be around babies and kids.
If there is a calm and positive environment between the two, encourage more interaction and playtime.
 Get the pet to interact with the baby by letting the animal sniff them and the baby to touch the pet's fur. Watch the baby's reactions and facial expressions to see if they enjoy it, especially if the pet starts to lick the baby's feet out of nowhere.

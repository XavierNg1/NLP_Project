 Check their online shop to make sure the wine is not out of your price range. There is no doubt that you will visit the famous wineries, so make an attempt to seek out the smaller, family-owned wineries. Many of these smaller wineries are required by law to take reservations only, so call ahead to make an appointment.;
, Some wineries will close their doors to late appointees. If you are going to be late, call ahead and warn them.
 Smaller wineries seldom charge a tasting fee. Medium-size wineries tend to have a tasting fee that can be waived. Larger wineries are less likely to waive their tasting fee. Tasting fees are typically around five to seven dollars but can be as much as twenty or more.
 Many wineries will allow you to take the wine outside, so that you can walk around the vineyards, enjoy the weather and have the best tasting experience for yourself.
 If you don't like the wine or if you just wanted a sip rather than the typical 3 oz. taste, dump the rest of the wine into the spit bucket. The employees will not be offended. Alternatively, if you are the designated driver, you may spit the wine into the spit bucket rather than swallowing.
 They are usually very friendly and they have knowledge about wine that they will be enthusiastic to impart.
 Don't be ashamed if you can't afford them.
 Remember to budget if you have other wineries left to visit.

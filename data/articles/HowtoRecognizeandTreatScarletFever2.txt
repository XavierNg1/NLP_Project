 Make the appointment as soon as you notice multiple symptoms as listed above. Ensure that you ask many questions while in the doctor’s office. Physicians can be busy and accidentally skip over small details.
 In most instances, your child will have to take antibiotics to kill the bacteria that cause scarlet fever. Penicillin is often prescribed, as is amoxicillin. If your child is allergic to either of these common antibiotics, Macrolides or Clindamycin are alternatives. Your doctor can tell you which one will work for your child., All medications come with detailed information about how to use them. Don’t skip any of the steps or ignore any of the warnings.Read the instructions carefully, especially the warnings section. You need to know how to tell if your child is allergic to the medication. You also need to know if mixing it with any other medications the child is taking might further sicken him.
Be aware of how long the child should take the antibiotics. If the instructions say to take it for ten full days, then ten days it is, no matter if the child protests! Halting the use of the medicine will not rid the child of scarlet fever.
Give the appropriate dose. Do not give more or less than what is needed. For instance, don’t give your child two pills instead of one in the hopes of ridding him of the illness more quickly. You wouldn’t want your child to end up back at the doctor’s office.

 Trip up tongues by stringing together sounds that are very similar, but not identical. Find letter combinations that are almost alliterative, but not quite: like "c," "ch," and "cl."Try to say "Irish wristwatch." This tongue twister is hard because "rish" is consonant with "wris," and the addition of the "sh" sound confuses the two "ris" sounds.
 Consider the tongue twister "She sells seashells by the seashore." "She sells" is a reverse of "sea shells" in that the "s" and "sh" syllables are flipped between the phrases.
 For instance, "s," "f," and "th" sound similar enough that they can trip someone up. Similarly, "ck," "x," and "th" can blend together when strung together in quick succession.


Try to say "Theophilus Thistle, the thistle sifter, sifted a sieve of unsifted thistles."
Try to say "The sixth sick sheik's sixth sheep's sick."

 A lot of minnow species are too small to catch using a standard fishing pole. There are larger minnows such as the creek chub that are ideal for the fishing pole. Creek chubs are found particularly in smaller creeks that weave through the land that may lead to nearby river or lake.


Look at a map to best scout out one of these locations., Larger minnows are best caught using fly fishing techniques rather than standard spin fishing. It is advised to use small dry flies with a 3 weight fly rod. It is much more difficult to use a spin fishing rod for catching minnows alone. Here are specific flies that are commonly used to catch larger minnows:


Nymph fly
14 Humpy
Woolly worm, Again, this is a technique for more advanced fishermen who already have access to fly fishing gear and knowledge. Pick out a few local spots that are densely forested with plenty of creeks and a larger base of water nearby. Bring a large cooler for the minnows you catch.


Start early in the morning and spend some time fishing in the creeks.
Focus your fly around large trees and scout for schools of minnows.
 Waxworms are good bait for micro fishing, such as fishing for minnows. Attach the waxworm to your hook and cast your line into a creek. Don’t use a lot of slack with the waxworm attached. You barely need to submerge your line to attract a minnow with the waxworms.


Again, store what you catch in a large cooler with water to best preserve your catch.

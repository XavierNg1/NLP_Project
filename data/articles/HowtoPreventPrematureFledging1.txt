 Although they are harder to clean out, and more difficult for shorter people to monitor, premature fledging is less likely to occur if you have a top opening nesting box. This type of nesting box is especially effective at preventing premature fledging if the entrance is covered with a sock or piece of cloth while checking the box.To make cleaning more easy, make your nesting box open multiple ways, for example from the sides, front, and top. However, only use the top opening to monitor the box.;
, Make monitoring easy by placing a plastic strawberry basket in the box before nest building occurs. Strawberry baskets allow you to smoothly and quickly slide the nest out of the box, without touching or disturbing the contents, to monitor it.It also helps with the removal of blowflies. Blowflies will drop through the basket and onto the floor of the nesting box instead of remaining in the nest with the baby birds.
 A small mirror is helpful to look inside the nest without disturbing it. Install a small mechanicâ€™s or dental mirror just inside the entrance hole. Shine a small penlight at the mirror. The light will bounce of the mirror allowing you to see the nest with minimal disturbances.Use super glue to secure the mirror inside the box.

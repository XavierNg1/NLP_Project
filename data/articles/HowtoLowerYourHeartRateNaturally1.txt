 It is widely known that stress can increase your heart rate. When you are stressed, your body releases adrenaline, increasing your heart rate to assist in dealing with the stressor. Breathing techniques relax and calm your body and mind, thereby lowering your heart rate. Sit up straight. Put one hand on your belly and the other on your chest. Inhale deeply through your nose. You should feel the hand on your belly rise, but the hand on your chest should not move. Breathe out slowly, with your mouth barely open. Use your hand on your belly to push air out, if you want. Repeat this exercise 10 times.
Quickly inhale and exhale through your nose (about three breaths a second), keeping your mouth closed. Then breathe normally. Repeat this process for 15 seconds or more.;

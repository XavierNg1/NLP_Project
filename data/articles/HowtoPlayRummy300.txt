, Then draw a card, and place it face up next to the draw pile to become the discard pile., If you take one from lower down in the discard pile, you must also take all the cards above it. If you have a meld, you can lay them down. There are two types of melds:

Runs - These must be three or more cards of the same suit in sequence.
Sets - These must be three or four cards of the same rank.


These are worth 50 points, and if you meld a joker, you must declare what card it represents. If another player has that card, it is exchanged and the joker is now worth 25 points. If it's exchanged yet again, it's worth 0 points. Also keep in mind that if a card is played before the joker is played and declared as that point, the joker can't be claimed at all.
 Once you have gotten rid of all your cards by placing the one card you have left into the discard pile, the round is over.

If a player gets rid of their hand without discarding to the discard pile, it's called floating. Each player now has one more chance to beat that score. If not, the round is over.
 Cards in the discard pile that are the same points as the cards in your hand cancel each other out.

Count up the cards in your hand, then the cards in the discard pile. The amount is subtracted from the cards in your hand and from the discard pile. The cards are scored as follows:

Cards 2-9: 5 points
10s: 10 points
Faces: 10 points
Aces: 15 points


If there are more points in the discard pile than in the hand, your score for that round is negative.
 To go Rummy, if your opponent has laid a card down that can indeed be melded, pick it up before they do, declare Rummy, and put it into a meld.

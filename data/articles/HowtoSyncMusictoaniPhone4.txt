 The benefit of using a playlist system is that you can manually manage the songs on your iPhone and monitor the storage capacity at the bottom of the screen so as not to go over the allowed content capacity of your iPhone. You can do so by choosing "New Playlist" under the File tab at the top of the screen or by clicking on the plus sign located in the bottom left corner of iTunes.
 This will allow you to remember that this playlist is specifically for transferring music to your iPhone.
 You can always easily delete songs from a playlist without deleting them from your iTunes library.
 Make sure that the "Sync Music" box is checked, and then look at the options underneath.


If running iTunes 11, the newest version, first visit the "Summary" page of your iPhone management screen and the click the box that says "Manually manage music and videos" in the "Options" box.
 Check the box(es) of the playlist(s) you want to sync.
 Your iPhone should automatically start the sync.
 Hit "Sync" in the bottom left corner of the screen. Your iPhone will then update and the playlist will transfer to your phone.

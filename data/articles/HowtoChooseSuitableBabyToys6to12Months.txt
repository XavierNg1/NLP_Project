 This is the best free toy you can give a child. Open both ends of a cardboard box for their tunnel or fort. Children at this age LOVE to crawl and explore, so give them every opportunity to do so. Washed "Pringles" cans can act like microphones and they love to get in and out of boxes (great for stretching the legs).;
, Any material that they won't rip easily or come apart is recommended. They're also better and easier for the child to turn pages rather than regular paper. Look for books that have different textures, "peek-a-boo" pop-ups, and bright pictures to them.
 Stuffed animals and toys that sing the different parts of the body, ABC's, different baby songs, and everyday greetings can teach your young one.
 Buckets that have different shapes for example triangles and stars encourages the child to match the pieces into the correct holes.
 Plastic and "pretend" machines and "gadgets" for example cell phones, keys, and other "adult" imitation objects can let them become adults in their own way. Motor skills and other developmental areas can really blossom with these toys.
 A great exercise toy, for example a Evenflo Exersaucer, can keep a baby entertained and safe. Sitting down or standing up, posture and leg strength are both used for these kinds of toys.

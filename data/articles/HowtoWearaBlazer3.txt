 A simple style can be worn with this look, but this is also a good opportunity to have a little fun with your look. You could choose a blazer with decorated pockets, an interesting lapel, or some type of design on the front. Classic neutrals, like black, brown, gray, and white, tend to be the easiest to match, but you could also try a pastel or gemstone blazer for an interesting twist.
 You can choose just about any neckline, from v-necks and square necks to turtlenecks and cowls, but you should try the dress on with the blazer before wearing it out to make sure that the neckline does not clash with the way the blazer is cut.


The "little black dress" is a good option for your blazer, especially if you have a pinstripe blazer or a blazer that is a few shades lighter and somewhat decorated.
As an alternative to a solid dress, you can also wear a nice blouse and pencil skirt. Make sure to add a little feminine or glamorous detail. A vertical ruffle down the front of the shirt works wonders, or a skirt with a little metallic shine can also take your look to a whole new level.
 Closed-toe heels tend to look best, but you should opt for a bit of color or embellishment to make the outfit look a little dressier. Depending on your dress, strappy high-heeled sandals can also work well. If heels are not your thing, though, you can also get away with an embellished flat.
 Style your hair however you usually would when dressing up, whether that means giving yourself an up-do or keeping your hair down in sultry waves. Your make-up should not be caked on too much, but a dramatic lip color or smoky eye can really pump this look up. Your jewelry should still be kept to a few pieces, but colored jewels, sparkling diamonds, or pearls can really invigorate your look.

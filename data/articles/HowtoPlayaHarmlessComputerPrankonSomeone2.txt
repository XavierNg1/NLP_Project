 You don't have to open any windows or minimize any windows that are open. This trick will flip the entire display.


Note that this only works on computers with Intel processors.
 Depending on which arrow key you press, this key combination will flip their screen in the direction of that arrow key.


If this doesn't work, you may need to enable Hot Keys. To do that, just right-click on the desktop and go to Graphics Properties. Under Hot Keys, make sure that "Enable Hot Keys" is checked.
 All of their windows and their desktop display should be affected, so they won't be able to easily figure out how to fix it.
 To do this, just press the same key combination that you used before, but end with the up arrow. So you'll be pressing Ctrl+Alt+â†‘.

 Fill it with the liquid of your choice. As explained in the method above, for a standard ice shot glass, just use water, or try filling it with orange juice or Gatorade for a colorful effect. Or, use a virgin version of the alcoholic drink.;
, Keep in mind that a standard shot glass holds 1.5 oz of liquid. Consider using a plastic shot glass so you can be sure of the volume.
 This will help to ensure that you can pull the cup out later. It only needs to be a very fine layer, either brushed on or dipped.
 Pour out excess water until there is just a lip at the top of the small cup that's exposed. Use toothpicks, duct tape, or a heavy object such as a clean pebble to keep the smaller cup in place (otherwise you'll notice it trying to bob about).
 Leave there until the water freezes solid.
 Pull the smaller shot glass out. If it's waxy or you've oiled it, it should slide out fairly easily.
 This will make it easier to slide the frozen shot glass out. Note: do not use hot water, or the ice may crack. Slightly warmer than room temperature should be sufficient.
 Obviously, only pour cold or chilled drinks into the glass, to avoid speeding up the melting process.
, Then, fill with your favorite beverage and enjoy!

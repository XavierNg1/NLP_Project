 You donâ€™t need to share everything to everyone. Share only key moments or essential stuff.
 Instead of broadcasting yourself to everyone, limit your audience by doing your own video conferencing with your friends and family. There are other apps available for this, like Skype, Google Hangouts, and others.
 Instead of doing live broadcasts, go old-school and use a video camera to record yourself. Share the video to your friends and family, without going through the Internet.

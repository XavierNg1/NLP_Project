 This should help the green color come out, or at least fade a bit. Your hair should be clean before you continue to the next steps.;
, Mix 1/2 cup of water with 1/4 cup of vinegar in a bowl that is big enough to hold all the hair that has turned green, which is usually only the tips.
 In the bowl filled with the vinegar mixture, soak your hair for about two minutes.
 Add 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml) of baking soda to the water while your hair is still in the bowl. Let it fizz up and get in your hair for 2-3 minutes.


You can also make a paste out of shampoo and baking soda and use this to wash your hair in the shower.
 Take your hair out and lay it on a dry towel. Pat it dry until it isn't dripping.
 Rinse your hair in warm water until all the vinegar is gone.


To make sure all the vinegar is out, put a small lock of hair in your mouth and suck on it. If you taste vinegar, rinse it more thoroughly.
 If your hair is still green at this point (your hair should still be damp), put 4-5 teaspoons of hydrogen peroxide in your hand and comb it through with your fingers. You can also rub the hydrogen peroxide into your strands with your hands. Do not apply it to your scalp. Let the peroxide stay in your hair until the green is out. Watch your hair to see when the green is gone and then rinse.
 If your hair is still green after using hydrogen peroxide, then you may just have to let it wear out.

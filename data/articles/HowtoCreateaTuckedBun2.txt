 Start with dry hair. Brush through it to ensure itâ€™s tangle-free. Lift the hair at the top of your head and use a pick or comb to lightly tease it at the roots. This will soften up the style and provide a little volume.








Use a volumizing powder or dry shampoo to create additional volume, if desired.
 Start on the left side. Use your fingers to separate one chunk of your hair at the crown of your head. Then separate another chunk, approximately the same size as the first, right above your ear. Loosely braid both pieces and secure the ends together with a clear hair elastic.
 Then secure both sides of double-braids together with a single elastic at the back of your head. Make sure you secure them loosely. The braids should drape rather than pull.
 Hold the low ponytail in place with your hand, but do not secure it with an elastic. Use your other hand to gather the ends together and pull them up. Loop all of your hair around and tuck the ends down between the braids to create a loose bun. Pull the ends through and secure them in place with bobby pins.








For a slightly different look, create a very loose angled braid with your remaining hair, then loop it around to create the bun.
 If any areas feel loose, use a few more bobby pins underneath the bun to hold everything in place. Pull out a few face-framing pieces to soften up the overall look. Mist your entire head with hairspray.

 This may sound odd because you're training a barrel horse, but it is better to take things at a slow pace and not rushing it. When you see a horse that is rearing before they run or fights a bit when they see a pattern, that's because they were rushed on the pattern and think that it's the only thing that matters when they see a barrel is to win.
 When you run barrels, warm up a lot. Lope around the arena a lot, switch directions, do roll backs, and let the horse know you are always in control, while having soft hands. Walk the pattern one time, then turn him and make him face the pattern until he drops his head. Once he does, trot the pattern, then stop and do the same as before. Then lope it a few times, and after each run make him turn, face the pattern until he drops his head. Then, walk the pattern one more time and leave the arena.
 Don't let your horse think that once he's saddled up it's time to run. It's good to let him do other things. Play with him in pasture, go on a trail ride, or even mess with cows. Another thing that can ruin a barrel horse's mindset, is when it thinks it's only job is barrel racing.
 This is where things go wrong. After continuing your training routine for about a year, your horse may start fighting and wanting to go fast. Don't let him. When he does this, it means he's close to being a well controlled, lightning fast barrel horse, but wait until YOU want him to. Usually, he will carry this behavior for a while, from maybe a few weeks to a couple months. But once he's back to normal and is being very responsive on the pattern, it's time to let him go. If he ends up acting crazy once you start galloping him, take it back to square one.

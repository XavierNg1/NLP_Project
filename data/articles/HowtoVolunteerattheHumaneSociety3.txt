 The “why” of volunteering will lend tremendous insight into how you might be of value to the Humane Society. If you love seeing animals well cared for, you may be best suited to bathing and walking animals as a volunteer worker. If you want to see more organization in your local chapter, office work may be better suited to your needs.Shelters want you to enjoy volunteering as much as possible. Make sure you choose something that you can truly commit to long-term.
 Take some time to evaluate any pertinent skills you might have. Your skills do not have to be honed--you do not need to bring a graphic design degree to the table, for instance--but should be consistent. If you are a very patient person, you would likely do well acting as a bather. If you are great with customer service, you might be an excellent choice to work the front counter.Some shelters will conduct interviews, of sorts, to determine how you should volunteer. Be prepared for your interview by having all of your relevant strengths and weaknesses compiled.
 Before deciding what chapter to call or email, do some research to determine what type of volunteering you’d like to do. Volunteering with your local Humane Society branch is going to provide you with the most hands-on volunteer opportunities, while the national branch may be more of an effort to raise awareness.
 While not everyone will require you to present a volunteer resume, it will help the branch know where to place you.

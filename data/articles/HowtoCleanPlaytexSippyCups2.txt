 As with toys, your child’s cups and eating supplies should be sanitized every few weeks, especially after your child has been sick. Washing the sippy cup removes dirt and grime, but sterilizing it removes germs and additional bacteria.
 Wash the sippy cup like normal (either in the dishwasher or by hand), and then create a solution by mixing together 1 tablespoon bleach with 1 gallon (3.8 L) water.Disassemble the sippy cup and let it soak in the bleach solution for two minutes.


Rinse the sippy cup well to remove all of the bleach, and let the pieces air dry before putting the parts back together.
 You can also use a microwave sterilizer, which are available at baby stores in the bottle section. Follow the device’s specific instructions, which will typically involve filling the bottom of the sterilizer with water, then placing the sippy cup parts into the device and microwaving them for a few minutes. Remove the pieces from the sterilizer and let them air dry.


These sterilizers are designed to safely kill germs without melting the sippy cup or releasing chemicals.
Read all of the instructions before using to make sure you aren’t missing important steps that could cause the process to be harmful.

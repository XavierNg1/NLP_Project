 If you are able to buy large trees and shrubs you will be able to have an instant garden; if you can’t afford them then you will need patience to grow young plants. For instance, Perennials can bloom and reach their maximum height in the first couple of years, so don’t spend money on big plants. Besides, it will be very interesting to see them grow as time goes by.
 Many people get excited and try to cram too much into a small space, but overcrowded plants tend to be unhealthy, so always think about what their final spreads will be when drawing up your plan. The best way to make your plants look fuller is to put them all in a group together.
 If you group plants in the shape of a sausage (which works well for cottage and prairie styles), or in triangle shapes they will look better and you will be able to create harmony among disparate groups.

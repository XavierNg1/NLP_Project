A joystick is highly recommended... that is if you want to stand out from the crowd. They are much smoother than your keyboard and mouse, have easy-reach buttons to customize for different tasks, and after all... it's what you use to fly a real jet! Make sure your joystick is properly calibrated, so that you have less balancing issues to worry about. An uncalibrated  joystick also reduces your turn rate towards the particular axis where the stick is unbalanced. This affects you tremendously!;
, Take some physics into consideration as well... it might sound funny since it is a video game, but it still applies! Especially get to be familiar with the art of dogfight, since dogfights play a key role to victory in the game if you do not manage to take out your enemy by surprise.
 You should be concentrating on your targets and threats while in the air. Flying into the side of a mountain at 800 mph (1,300 km/h) while typing isn't something to brag about.
 Fly more often on servers running air maps. Have dogfights with friends for fun and practice. If you get the chance to be on the same side as a better pilot, spectate his ways of flight.

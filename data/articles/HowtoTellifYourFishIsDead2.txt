 Look for symptoms such as an inability to eat or sinking immediately after swimming to the top of the tank. This will be difficult to watch, but you should treat your fish like any other companion animal. Sit by the aquarium. Talk to your fish, if that's what you usually do., Clove oil is a sedative and is the most humane way to end the suffering of a dying fish. You can buy it in most drug stores. Place only the dying fish in 1 litre (0.26 US gal) of water. Add 400 mg of clove oil to the water. Within 10 minutes, the fish will lose oxygen and die peacefully., Use an aquarium net to scoop out the dead fish. If you can't find the body, don't worry. The body itself won't harm the other fish and will decompose naturally.

Fish parasites and diseases require living hosts. If you think your fish died of a disease, their tankmates might already be infected. Monitor them for symptoms. If they don't look sick or develop symptoms after a few days, they were strong enough to fight off the disease., A dead fish flushed into a non-native habitat could harm native marine life. Dispose of a dead fish in the garbage or bury them outside. If the fish is large, burial is usually best. Check your local laws to make sure they'll allow you to bury a pet fish.

 Define "Love". You must LOVE Doritos. Otherwise, the ad won't look as effective, and may not be accepted!;
, You must be prepared!

, Come on, think! You could possibly think of something as "Dori. Toes." and eat Doritos® with your feet (Not recommended, unless you shower before each rehearsal of this, which can become a huge drag). Also, make sure you actually eat some Doritos® in the ad!

, Hire at least 2 other people, and maybe a photographer. You need to film the ad!

, Get the photographer to film from different points to keep the ad interesting.
 Upload it to your computer and edit it with text, colours, anything! You could also try adding a voice in the background. This makes the ad more artistic!

, Take the film footage from the camera and send it to the address mentioned on the Doritos® ad request. They will keep the footage.

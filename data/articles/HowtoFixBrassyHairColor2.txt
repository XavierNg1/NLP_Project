 These lightweight foams are easy to use and meant to be applied in the shower, immediately after shampooing your hair. The foam boosts color and shine while breaking down brassy tones.The whole process only takes about 5 minutes and it’s extremely effective. These products are gentle enough to use as often as you like, although you will probably only need to use them about once per week.To use, apply to your hair from roots to tip immediately after shampooing. Rinse the foam out immediately or leave it on for 3 minutes to enhance your color, then rinse. Follow it up with a good conditioner.
For those with an ash or silver hair tone, you may want to use the mousse every day, post-shampoo.
Foam glosses are mostly found at beauty supply stores, but there are a few drugstore versions on the market.
 Temporary rinses are applied after you shampoo and towel dry your hair.Saturate your hair with the product and then run a comb through to ensure even distribution. You don’t need to rinse it out after applying – simply blow dry and style your hair as usual. It’s called a temporary “rinse” because the color boost only lasts until your next shampoo, which rinses the product out of your hair.You’ll need to wear rubber gloves when applying the product.Temporary rinses are usually sold exclusively at beauty supply stores.
 Semi-permanent toners contain no harsh chemicals and therefore they don’t damage your hair – a major plus. You can use them weekly and there are reasonably priced drugstore versions that you can try at home.


Apply the toner to clean, dry hair. Leave it on until you’ve achieved your desired color. Results should last 3-6 shampoos.
Avoid shampooing immediately after using a semi-permanent toner. You can condition safely immediately after, however, if you like.

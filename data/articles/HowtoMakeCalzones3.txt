, Remove the plastic wrap from the tray of dough pieces. Place the first piece of dough on a floured surface and use a rolling pin to roll it into disc shape. Continue until all the dough pieces are rolled into discs.
 Spoon filling into the center of each disc of dough. The filling should take up about 1/3 of the dough; don't add so much that it spreads to the edges, as this will prevent the calzones from cooking properly.
 Lift one side of a dough circle and fold it in half over the filling. Use your fingers or a fork to crimp the dough where the edges meet, so that you now have a half-moon shaped calzone. Repeat with the remaining dough circles.
 Lay the calzones on a greased baking sheet. Use a fork to poke a hole in the top of each calzone. Brush the calzones with a little olive oil. Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the calzones until the tops turn golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove them from the oven and serve warm.

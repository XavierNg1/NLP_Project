 This is an act that mimics slipping but you catch yourself and avoid any painful consequences that might come from falling on the ground.;
,, Do this action quickly.
 The leg that has "slipped" should be up in the air now.
 This is to give the impression of not being in control.
 Look a little flustered but good-natured about it all. Turk Pipkin noted that when Charlie Chaplin tripped over an object, he'd apologize to it automatically.You could try this, and if you do fall over, try apologizing to the floor as well!

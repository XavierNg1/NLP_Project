, The hat will end up being a cone, so the template needs to be quarter circle shaped in a size large enough for your dog. See the template image attached for guidance.
 Cut out a piece the exact same shape as the template.
 The sides should overlap slightly (about 1cm or 1/4"). Staple in place at the base, then hot glue the overlapped piece from the base to the top. Allow to dry.
 For the best fit, fold the elastic over to make two strands and knot the ends. Staple the knots to the sides of the cone, at the base.
 Glue the pompom to the top of the hat. Glue the braid around the base of the hat. Finish with a line of buttons, mini pompoms or foam dots/stars/bones/dog's name in the "front" of the hat. (Don't use buttons if you're worried that your dog might chew them off and swallow them.)

, Once it's a good fit, it's ready for use. Make more if you're holding a party with several dogs attending.

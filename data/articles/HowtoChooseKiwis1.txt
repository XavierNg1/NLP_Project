 Inspect the outer skin’s color and texture. A ripe kiwi’s skin is brown and fuzzy. Also, check for any bruises, dark spots, mold, or wrinkles. If the kiwi is bruised, shriveled, or has mold, then the kiwi is not good for eating and is probably overripe., Hold the kiwi between your thumb and four fingers. Apply light pressure with your thumb. If the kiwi slightly gives, then it is perfectly ripe; it should feel soft, but not too soft. On the other hand, if the kiwi gives too much when you apply pressure, it’s probably mushy and overripe., Also smell the kiwi for readiness. If the kiwi gives off a fragrant, citrus smell, then it is perfectly ripe and ready to eat. However, if the kiwi gives off a pungent, sweet smell then it is most likely overripe.

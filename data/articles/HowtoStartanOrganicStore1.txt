 It should also outline the steps you plan on taking in order to reach your goals. A business plan must include an executive summary, which provides a one-page overview of your goals, as well as a market analysis, company description, description of the product line, funding request, financial projections, and more.;
, Investors include anyone that you know or are somehow networked to who can give you money to start the business. Investors usually become part owners of your business. Lenders, on the other hand, are banks and other financial institutions you let you borrow the money in the form of loans. They do not become part owners, but you do need to pay the money back in time.
 You will need to contact your state government to apply for a business license/permit and to determine your business's tax status. Every state can determine its own regulations regarding business registration, but at the very least, you can expect to fill out the necessary registration forms and pay some sort of fee.
 More likely than not, you will end up renting or leasing a building rather than buying the space. Make sure that whatever building you lease is zoned for commercial purposes. If you plan on selling organic food at your organic store, make sure that the building is also zoned for food service purposes. If the building is not zoned properly, you will not be allowed to run an organic shop there.
 Most businesses do not require additional licenses. However, if organic food is a large part of your proposed stock, your state may require that you purchase a food and beverage license. These licenses can be obtained by your local department of health. You may need to go through a health inspection before you can receive one, however.

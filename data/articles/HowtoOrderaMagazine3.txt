 Most magazines have subscription cards inside their pages. You can tear the card out and fill out your ordering information. Then, you can mail it postage-free. You can choose to either be billed for the subscription or enclose a check.
 If your goal is to renew a subscription, filling out a subscription card is an easy way to do it. Some cards will have a box to check for renewing subscriptions, but for others, you will have to fill out the card as if you are subscribing to the magazine for the first time. Make sure to send in the card at least six weeks before your subscriptions ends to ensure that you don’t miss a month of receiving magazines.
 If you don’t want to fill out a subscription card, go to the magazine’s website and get their telephone number (usually found under “contact us.”) Call the subscription department. Complete your order with a customer service representative by providing your information over the phone.

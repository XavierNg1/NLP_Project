 The simplest, best, and easiest way to get started is to join an existing group. If you are less socially apt than average, this can seem daunting but ultimately can be a great way for you to make new friends. You can search local forums, ask around at cons, or inquire or advertise at your local game shop. Many universities and colleges, as well as some high schools, will also have clubs.


You must email, phone and/or meet the person hosting the group, and ask to join the game. The main thing you want to establish is age or social group. D&D is an activity that a mixed-age group can enjoy, but you don't necessarily want to be the only teenager in a room full of 40-year-olds.
 This takes a little more work on your part. You can advertise in many of the same locations described above or recruit friends, family, or coworkers to play with you.
 If you are the one organizing the game, this will likely be you. The DM should have a strong knowledge of the rules, or at least be willing to learn and run the game. They will want to do a little bit of preparation of an adventure before the first session.


This person should purchase or already have copies of the core rulebooks: The Player's Handbook, The Dungeon Master's Guide & the Monster Manual I. There are tons more books available, but you only need these three to run the game.
 Typically this involves a table with some chairs around it, and is usually at the DM's house/apartment (not for any real good reason, that just seems to be how it pans out). This should preferably be somewhere without distractions such as the TV or other folks who won't be playing, though some local pubs or game stores will sometimes specialize in providing facilities to groups for a fee or free.

 Cut them in half and scoop out the flesh from both sides. Chop the flesh into chunks.









The pretty dragon fruit skin makes an excellent serving dish for sorbet. Save the halves in your freezer if you wish to serve the sorbet in them.
 Place the dragon fruit in a blender with Â¾ cup water, 2 Tablespoons sugar, and 1 Tablespoon lemon juice. Pulse until the ingredients are smooth.
 Follow the manufacturer's instructions to freeze the sorbet.









If you don't have an ice cream freezer, you can still make sorbet by following these directions:

Pour the sorbet mixture into a baking dish. Cover it with plastic wrap and place it in the freezer.
After 2 hours, the mixture should be partially frozen. Use a spoon to stir it thoroughly, then cover it and place it back in the freezer.
Continue stirring the sorbet every two hours over 8 hours.
After 8 hours, allow the sorbet to freeze solid overnight.
 Serve with angel food cake, pound cake or another light pastry.

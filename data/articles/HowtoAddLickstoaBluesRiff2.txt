 The riffs and notes below are all variations on an intermediate blues rhythm riff in the key of E. Rather than reteach the entire rhythm section, you're encouraged to either review it yourself or simply use the licks below as a guide, fitting them into your play wherever you like.









This lick basically uses power chords to mimic the chords in the blues. You can use these chords through the entire song.
 A single-note line is when you just play multiple individual notes one after the other -- it is not a solo made up of only one note. After hitting your few chords, or listening to the rhythm player/singer hit them, you can play 5-6 notes from the pentatonic scale, any notes, for a screaming "mini solo." A good solid bend, ending on the next chord to get out of your lick and into the next measure is always welcome in the blues.
 This interplay between low and high creates tension and excitement in your licks. Look at the following riff, for example, which uses a deep E power chord to jump into some squealing, bluesy notes.









e |-------0-0-0---------------------------|
B |------/5-5-5---------------------------|
G |----------------2p0---------2-3------|
D |--2-------------------2----------------|
A |--2------------------------------------|
E |--0------------------------------------|

, Pick the 1st and 3rd strings with the pinky and ring finger of your strumming hand. It is a great way to alternate deep notes that you pick normally (like the 6th and 5th string) while juxtaposing higher pitched licks and notes into the solo. Really talented players can hold power chords up top, then use hybrid picking to add licks to their own rhythm playing. To practice, try the lick above with hybrid picking.
 Arpeggiated simply means you pick every note individually instead of strumming. Hitting the V chord, right before the song comes around to the root, and picking each note slowly throughout this final measure, is a slick little lick out of the twelfth bar. In the key of E, this final chord is a B. Make it a B7 for your final lick:









--2--
--0--
--2--
--1--
--2--
--X--

Note: You can do this with any turnaround in any key, as long as you know what the final chord is., A great blues lick is not necessarily the speediest playing, nor is it the most flashy. Look, for example, at B.B. King-- he could play as fast as anyone, yet the crowds go the wildest over 1-2 well-bent, well-placed notes. The blues is about feel and emotion. So put some thought into every note to really improve. Think about using:










Bends: Bent notes are essential for blues playing, as they give the emotion and power needed to really make your notes stand out.

Vibrato: Bending a note back and forth, "shaking" it, gives it a warbly, bluesy tone that makes the note stand out.

Slides: A slide up or down the neck is a great way to make the guitar "whine" getting high and emotional. It is also a good way to move quickly through the scale.

 Ask friends and family for recommendations, then take your car to the shop for something simple such as an oil change.;
, If you have a feeling or intuition that the mechanic is less than trustworthy, take your vehicle elsewhere. Take your car to a second mechanic for another opinion if the estimate sounds high, or if something just doesn't seems right. If your car isn't running, call a tow truck. You aren't obligated to stay with a mechanic just because he looked at your car and gave you an estimate.
 Ask if there have been any complaints about the mechanic, and if so, how the problems were resolved.
 The symbol should be not only on the sign, but on a certificate on the wall and usually on the mechanic's uniform. Shops approved by AAA (American Automobile Association) are also a good bet. AAA approval means that the work must be guaranteed for 6,000 miles (9,700Â km) or six months.
 Read your vehicle's manual and stay current with recommendations for oil changes and other maintenance schedules. Being familiar with your vehicle will help you prevent auto repair rip-offs.
 For example, if you have a foreign car, be sure the mechanic has the experience and equipment to deal with your vehicle.
 If you aren't sure, outline the problems very clearly and find out exactly how the mechanic plans to deal with each problem. Be specific and never give a mechanic free reign to do whatever your car needs without discussing it with you first.
 Read estimate carefully and ask questions if something seems odd or isn't clear. Ask if the parts and work are guaranteed.
 Check the bill carefully and ask for clarification on any discrepancies. Pay by credit card or check so that you have a record of payment and so you can stop payment if you think you've been ripped off.

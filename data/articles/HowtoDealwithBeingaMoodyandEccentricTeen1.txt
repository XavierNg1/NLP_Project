 You are the most important person in your life. Above all, you need to be happy. Take some time to yourself to decide where your moodiness stems from and make a list of things that you want changed.


Are you unhappy with your friends?
Are you annoyed by your family?
Do you dislike yourself?
Are the hormones just hitting you hard?;
, Now that you have identified the source of your unhappiness, you can start making the necessary changes to improve the situation. Start brainstorming ideas on how you can fix your problems so that they become smaller, if not completely gone. While you are brainstorming, just keep in mind that:


Not all of the problems you will face in life are an easy fix.
You can't always fix all of your problems--some of things are just out of your control.
Sometimes, the improvement of your problems may depend on the participation of others--don't let this discourage you.
Don't be afraid to ask other's for help if you are struggling to fix an issue.
 Take a step back and observe the situation in front of you--as if you are looking through an open window. If you want your situation to change, you have to take the first steps.


When looking for a solution, search inward at your role and what you personally can do to change the situation--but remember, you can only change your role in the situation.
Keep a calm mind. Try to refrain from thinking emotionally. When coming up with solutions, it is best to have logic on your side.
Learn as much about your situation as you can.The more you know about the situation you're in, the better able you will be to come up with possible solutions. Also, knowing what your facing relieves some of the anxiety from the uncertainty.
Take note of any and all resources you have available to you--these could be money, time, family, friends, or personal traits.
 Remember, not everything is in your control. When you start to feel overwhelmed by more issues than seems humanly possible, it's time to start letting go of things that you can't change. We often find ourselves clinging to situations from the past, willing the clock to rewind. Focusing all your energy on this will take away from the problems that we can fix. Don't dwell in the past--instead focus on the here and now.


Let go of the past. Let go of your mistakes. Focus on resolving your current problems and work on making the rest of your life and actions as good as they can be.
The problems from the past will often seem smaller if you focus on bettering yourself for a brighter future...even if that means coming to terms with the fact that your mistakes don't define you.
Stop focusing on your faults. Everybody has them--- and chances are, you've been unable to see that because you've been so focused on finding your own.
 Not all the problems you face in life can be solved alone. You should never feel like you're facing you're problems all on your own.


Remember that you have a support system--you are surrounded by people that care about you and will want to help you.
Asking for help doesn't mean that you are weak. Dealing with several problems all at once or even one large problem, will leave you feeling drained.

 For this battery you’ll need one plastic cup (6 to 8 ounces), two 3/4-inch-wide strips of metal that are taller than the cup, and one tablespoon (14.79 ml) of salt. Each strip must be a different type of metal, but you can choose which type: zinc, aluminum, and copper are popular choices. In addition, you’ll need a pair of scissors, a voltage meter, and 2 electrical lead wires with alligator clips at both ends.


A variation on this recipe is to add one teaspoon (4.93 ml) of salt, one teaspoon (4.93 ml) of vinegar, and a few drops of bleach to the water instead of one tablespoon (14.79 ml) of salt. If you choose this variation, be careful, as bleach is a hazardous chemical.
Metal strips, electrical lead wires, and voltage meters are available at hardware stores. You should also be able to find lead wires at shops that sell electrical components.
 Note that the cup doesn’t absolutely have to be plastic. It just has to be non-metallic. Styrofoam and paper cups will also work.
 It’s the same process if you decide to follow the salt, vinegar, and bleach variation.
 Ensure that the strips are touching the saltwater and extending past the cup’s rim. If the strips are too short, bend them so that they hang off the cup’s rim and dip into the solution.
 Attach one lead wire to one metal strip using an alligator clip. Then, attach a different lead wire to the other metal strip, again using the alligator clip.


Be careful not to let the alligator clips touch the water.
It doesn’t matter which color attaches to which strip.
 Following the instructions that come with your voltage meter, connect a lead wire from each metal strip to the voltage meter. The meter should read your battery’s voltage at roughly 3/4 of a volt.

 Pack a lunch and strike out for adventure. Look up local parks in your area and choose a scenic trail.


You don't need to go on an epic hike--just strolling around a small, local park can be a gratifying encounter with nature.
 Go to the ocean or a nearby lake, spread out your towel, and soak up some sun. You can swim, play beach volleyball, frisbee, or just relax and read a book.


Beach comb and look for sea glass and shells and use them in an art project later.
 If you don't have a sled you can use a piece of cardboard, a laundry basket, or the lid of a plastic container or big trash can.


Try ice skating.
Initiate a snowball fight.
 Most museums have a free day, either once a week or once a month. Try getting there early, since lot's of other people are bound to have the same idea.


Check with your local library for free museum pass. Some libraries have single-day passes to museums and other attractions in your area that can be used any day of the week (you may have to reserve them in advance).
 Ask your friends to bring one of their favorite films, pop some popcorn, and settle in for a lazy day of good cinema.


Set up a backyard film festival. Hang a white sheet in your back yard, borrow a projector, and cover the ground with blankets so you can watch movies under the stars.
Ask your friends to contribute by bringing some snacks and sodas. Hosting pot-luck style will keep you from spending lots of money on food and drinks.
 Experience the great outdoors without leaving your neighborhood. Set up a tent, toast marshmallows over a backyard fire or grill, and tell spooky stories. If you get too cold or freaked out in the night, you can just go inside to the comfort of your own bed.
 You'll be amazed by how re-energizing it can be to change up the placement of the furniture in your house. You'll be giving your house a makeover without spending a dime.

 In the new planting spot, make a hole about 5 inches (12.7 cm) deep. Resurrection lily bulbs will need about 10 inches (25.4 cm) of space between them and other bulbs.


Place them so that they are sitting on handful of bulb compost and with the pointed end facing upwards.
Fill in the hole with soil around the bulb and tap it down gently. Avoid pressing the dirt down with your feet. Water the area well.
 A two to three inch layer of mulch, such as hay or leaf mold, will help protect the bulbs over winter but you should remove the mulch in the spring to let the shoots appear.
 You should expect that the transplanted lilies might not bloom again the following year, or even the one after. Be patient and don’t give up on them as they will most likely recover from being transplanted eventually.

 One tried and true way to get over a past lover is to meet someone new. If you feel ready, be open to making new connections.


For the first few dates, avoid bringing up your ex. Over time you will be able to talk about her, but while it is still fresh it will only prevent you from moving forward.
 Even if you don't feel ready to date, make sure you are spending time with friends. Stay connected to your social sphere.It's normal to want to be alone after a break-up. Do not isolate yourself for too long or it will keep you from moving forward.
 It will be more difficult to forget about your ex if you continue doing the same things you did when you were together. Find new activities that are not associated with her, and will allow you to surround yourself with new faces.


Explore new bars and restaurants so that you meet a new batch of people. There are probably many places you never had the chance to explore while you were together.
Join a new club or find a new activity that will allow you to make new friends. These new friends and activities will distract you from the past. They will also share a bond with you that is totally outside of your ex.

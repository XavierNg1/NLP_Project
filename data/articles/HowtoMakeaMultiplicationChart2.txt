 This type of chart is made up of separate tables for each factor. Each table shows the sequence of products when you multiply this factor by other numbers.

For example, this type of chart has a table showing all the products of the factor 1, another table for all the products of the factor 2, another table for all the products of the factor 3, etc.

Unlike a times table, this type of chart shows the number sentences for each factor.
 The standard multiplication chart is for factors 1-12, but you might need to create a chart with fewer or more factors, depending on your teacher’s requirements.
 Each table should have 12 rows and 3 columns. All 12 tables should fit on one piece of paper. Make sure your table is neat by using ruler to create the lines. It is also best to use graph paper, or you can make your chart in a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel.
 Each cell in this column will have a number 1, since this is the table for the factor 1.
 In the first column of each table, you will simply repeat whatever factor that table represents. So the second table should have a 2 in each cell, the third table should have a 3 in each cell, etc.
 In the second column you will write each factor, from 1-12. This column will be the same in each table.
 The multiplication sign will come between the two factors. The equals sign will come after the second factor.

For example, in the first table, you should have:1×1={\displaystyle 1\times 1=}1×2={\displaystyle 1\times 2=}1×3={\displaystyle 1\times 3=}1×4={\displaystyle 1\times 4=}1×5={\displaystyle 1\times 5=}1×6={\displaystyle 1\times 6=}etc.
 This column will show the product of each multiplication sentence. To fill in this column quickly, simply add whatever factor that table represents to each product.For example, the products for the 5s table are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 10, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60. Notice that for each new product, you are adding 5 to the product that came before.

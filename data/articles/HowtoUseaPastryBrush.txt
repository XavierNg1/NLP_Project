 It's a good idea to know what you want to use pastry brushes for as they can vary in size and quality for different tasks:


Traditional pastry brushes are made from natural bristles.
Newer pastry brushes are made from nylon bristles.
The newest kind of pastry brushes are made from silicone.;
, Pastry brushes can be used for a variety of tasks in the kitchen:


Use to put an egg wash, sugar glaze, salt glaze, or melted butter on pastry.
Use to add fat before assembling phyllo dough.
Use to add a glaze to meats and fish.
Add delicate glazes to cakes and cookies.
Use for candy-making. Such brushes should not be used for any other purpose to avoid tainting candy and chocolate with grease from other foods.
 Natural bristle and nylon bristle brushes can be harder to keep clean than silicone versions. However, they must be cleaned regularly to prevent the growth of bacteria on the fat attached to the bristles after basting.


Dip natural or nylon bristle pastry brushes into bleach solution after washing.Wash silicone pastry brushes with hot water and detergent. Or, simply throw it into the dishwasher.
 Do not put away wet; oily is okay provided the brush has been washed properly.

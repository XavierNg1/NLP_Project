 If you are a free user and want to be able to use other features on Spotify, like listening to music offline, upgrade to Premium.


Tap the three-bar icon at the top left to open the menu.
 This will open a window where you can enter your credit card details.
 You can sign up for a 30-day trial first, so if you decide you don’t want to continue using its Premium features, you can cancel the subscription.


Enter your credit card details in the fields provided. When you’re done, tap “Start 30-day trial now.”
You will not be charged until after the 30-day trial. If you don’t want to continue with the Premium version, you can cancel online anytime.

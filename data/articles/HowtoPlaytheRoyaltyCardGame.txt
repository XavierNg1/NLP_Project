 Royalty is a game that at least two players must play.;
, Deal out at least one card to each player. There are several quantities of cards that each have a determined "alphabetical letter" on them.


Pick the first letter or the last letter of the English alphabet, and see who comes closest to it. Although the Royalty instruction booklet says to come as close to Z as possible, it can also work coming as close to A either.
, Each player, by the end, should be holding seven cards, each with their own set of seven lettered cards.
 This game, in this respect is much like 500 Rummy/Rummy 500, but with lettered cards instead of numbered cards. Lay these cards out in front of you.
, The next player may meld a card (play another whole word) or capture the word by adding cards to your side of the table that best changes the meaning of a pre-existing word. Each card.


Pluralizing a word isn't allowed, along with adding a prefix or suffix to a word.

When capturing, only significant word change additions can be laid out in front of the player. Bear can't become bears but bear can become beard (assuming the player has these cards in their hand).
Don't try rearranging the letters in the other word to form a new word.
, The player with the most points, along with the player with the most "bonus" points from special moves is declared the winner.


The points scored for each card played is marked on the card.
Score a full word in one color at double the card's value.
Double the person's score if all seven cards can be played on any one single turn.
If any of the players were able to form the word "ROYALTY" out of the cards, double this player's final (grand total) score.
Cards played that were the result of a capture, can be scored at double the point values of these particular cards.

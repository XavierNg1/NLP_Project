 If you’ve tried everything and your dog still wakes you up, you may consider having your dog sleep in another room. By putting your dog in another room, you’ll make sure that you have restful sleep and your dog is undisturbed during the night.


Make sure to provide your dog with a comfortable bed if you put them in another room.
Be aware, keeping your dog in another room, especially if they’re already used to sleeping with you, might result in crying, barking, or a dog with hurt feelings., Some dogs may find it hard to sleep without waking up their owner. This is especially true of high energy dogs that are not crated at night. A solution to this is keeping your dog in a create at night. By putting your dog in a crate, you’ll send your dog the signal that night time is sleep time, and you’ll also remove their ability to run around or disturb your sleep.


Housing your dog in a crate at night will prevent them from jumping on you and licking you awake in the morning.
Make sure that the crate is big enough for your dog. Dogs 0-15 pounds should have small crates, dogs 16 to 35 pounds should have medium rates, dogs 36 to 65 pounds should have large crates, and dogs over 65 pounds should have extra-large crates., Some dogs may bark to wake you up at night because they’re lonely or want your attention. One way to address this is to have your dog sleep in the same room as you. By moving your dog into the same room as you, you may eliminate the reason why your dog is barking and waking you up.


Provide your dog with a crate, bed, or somewhere to sleep in your room.
Make sure to set boundaries from the very beginning. This means creating a space and then training your dog to sleep in until you are awake.

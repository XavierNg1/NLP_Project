 If you have more than one keyboard layout installed, and you need more than one installed, you can change on the fly. There are two different ways to do this:


Click the Language button in your System Tray and select the language you want to use. This appears when you have more than one language or keyboard installed.
Press âŠž Win+Space to cycle between your installed languages and keyboards.;
, If your keyboard is typing in the wrong language, or you can't select the correct one, you can change this from the Settings menu.
 This will open the region settings for your computer.
 You'll be able to set the languages installed on your computer from this menu.
 If you have more than one language here, the incorrect one may be selected, causing your keyboard to perform incorrectly. Select the language you want to use as your default language and click the "Set as default" button.


Note: Your display language will change to your new default language when you sign out and sign in.
 You'll usually only have one language listed here, but if you have more than one, click your currently-selected language.
 This will load the additional options for your installed language.
 If you have multiple keyboards listed in the "Keyboards" section, remove any that you don't use. This will ensure that only the correct layout is selected.


Click an installed keyboard that you want to remove and click the "Remove" button.
Keyboards that use a layout other than "QWERTY" will result in the wrong characters appearing when you hit the key.
 If your regular keyboard layout isn't listed, click the "Add a keyboard" button and find the keyboard you want to use.

 Href generally gives the browser the link to the item. You'll need to add all HTML code up to this point before crossing any further into the document.;
, You'll need to have the "mailto:" and the users email line ready.
 A properly formatted command so-far would be href="mailto:Â agentavery@sample.com" .
 While most often not used, it is possible to add information to prefill the subject line via the mailto syntax. However, it's more often used when the mail is being sent to a server inside a robot that handles incoming mail so it can be processed later (so it can be filtered).
 Type a question mark followed by the trigger word "subject" followed by an equals sign followed by the subject inside a pair of quotation marks.


Try not to use characters that aren't alphanumeric in the subject line. There are ways to work around this so your link doesn't get stumped and thinks it's part of something else".
 You can add "body" as well as a cc or a bcc line, just make sure to use a question mark followed by the term "body"/"cc"/"bcc" followed by an equals sign followed by the prefilled text for that line.
 After your ending triangular bracket on the front of the tag, you'll need something to designate this item as an email link. This can be a word, a phrase, or even a duplicate copy of the person's email address this is being sent to. Most often, this can be the phrase "here" or "this" or something of that sort.
 Anchor tags must have closure for this trick to work and not make the remainder of the page become an extension of the anchor tag. Type </a> to close it off.

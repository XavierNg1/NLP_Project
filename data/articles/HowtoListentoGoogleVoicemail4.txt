 Locate the app with a green dialogue icon with the closing quotation marks in it to open Hangouts.
 If you’re not logged in yet, do so. Use the Gmail email address you use for your Google Voice to log in.
 Swipe right on the screen to go to your Hangouts list page (the heading should be “New Message”).
 If you have any new voicemails, you’ll find unread voicemail notifications at the top of your Hangouts list. These will have the voicemail icon (like a tape deck).
 Tap on the notification with the voicemail you want to listen to, and then tap the play icon to begin playing back the message.

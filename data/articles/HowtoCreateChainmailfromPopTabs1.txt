 Bend the collar side downward using the key. Use the key to continue bending the collar backward so that it's tucked firmly against the tab. Repeat for each pop tab.;
, Cut in the middle of the pull part of the tab using the cutter tool. Make sure you cut in the same place on every tab, for consistency.
 Place the tab inside the staple remover, cut the side first and close the remover down on top of pop tab. Use your finger to push the cut side down. The remover should create a slight bend or bridge looking shape in the pop tab when complete.
 This may take a little time. Consider maintaining finished pop tabs in a separate bowl, bag or stacked off to one side.

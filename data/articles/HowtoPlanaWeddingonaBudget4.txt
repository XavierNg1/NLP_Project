 Being able to pay cash up front will give you access to more budget-friendly vendors who can offer their services cheaper by not having overhead like billing and so on. Cheaper vendors are also booked up sooner, so have money ready to secure their services as soon as possible.
 Every time you agree on or put down money on an expense, put it right in the spreadsheet. Don't eyeball it! If you do, the costs will get away from you.
 From uncooperative weather to invitation misprints, vendor screw-ups to extra guests, there will be costs you didn't think of or couldn't have foreseen. Keep calm and be prepared for these extra expenses.

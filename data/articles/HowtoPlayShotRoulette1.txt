 Get any type of alcoholic drink you like. Stick with just one type of liquor for traditional shots, or mix it up with all different kinds of alcohol, including:


Red or white wine
Beer
Hard cider
Vodka, rum, whiskey, gin, or tequila;
, Pick out any non-alcoholic beverages you like. You may want to choose liquids of the same color as your alcohol to make it more confusing which is which. Try:


Water or clear soda to look like vodka, gin, rum, or tequila
Grape juice to look like wine or brandy
Cola or root beer to look like whiskey or dark rum
Ginger ale or cream soda to look like beer
Juice or sports drinks to look like colored liquor

, Get enough glass or disposable plastic shot glasses to complete a big circle or several rows. Pour your alcoholic drink or drinks into half the number of your shot glasses and your non-alcoholic drinks into the other half.


You don’t need a specific number, but two shot glasses per player is recommended.Use different colored and opaque shot glasses to partially disguise the color or type of liquid inside.
 Set your filled shot glasses on an even surface like a large table or hard floor. Pick a surface that you can easily clean, as shots may get knocked and spilled.


If you’re playing the version using a bottle to spin, place the shot glasses in a large circle and put an empty wine, liquor, or beer bottle in the center of the circle. Make sure the bottle is completely empty for the best spin.
If you’re playing the version using cards and dice, place the shot glasses in rows.

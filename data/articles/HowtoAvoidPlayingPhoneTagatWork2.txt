 Before leaving a message with an assistant, ask if this is the best way to get in touch. Some people would prefer to touch base with an assistant, but others are more likely to listen to a voicemail. Leave your message using the other person’s preferred method., By including this information in every message, you ensure the other person won't have to look it up before calling you back. State your name and number at least two times in a message. If the person does not know you personally, spell your name, so you’re sure they know who’s called them., Some voicemails garble messages, and you don’t want to miss an opportunity to talk just because your message was misunderstood. Repeat any important information to ensure it is received by the person you’re contacting., If they don’t know how long a call will last, people start to dread returning a phone call. Include an estimated call time in your message. Most importantly, stick to it. Don’t ask for ten minutes and take an hour. Make sure your estimate is accurate.


Consider saying something like, “I need 10 minutes of your time.”
Ask for an amount of time, “When can we schedule 15 minutes to discuss our project?”
Take the other person’s schedule into consideration, “Are you available to set aside thirty minutes to talk about this?”, If there are specific questions or topics you need to answer on the call, email or text these to your coworker in advance. This allows her to feel better prepared for the conversation, and will keep the length of the call brief., Don’t assume your coworkers know your deadlines. Let the person you’re calling know, “I need this information to complete the project by Friday, the 17th.”

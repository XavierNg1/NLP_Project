 Cover with heavy-duty aluminum foil and poke 10 slits in the top with a knife.








The slits will let the steam from the popcorn release and help make the popcorn crispier, with just the right crunch.
 Shake the bowl constantly, using a pair of tongs to hold the bowl. Continue shaking until the popcorn finishes popping, approximately 3 minutes.
 Stir in any salt that is on the side of the bowl with a spatula.
 Serve immediately.








This method is slightly quicker than the traditional method, since you don't test 3 or 4 kernels and then wait the 30 seconds once those have popped.
This method also creates fewer dishes, since the bowl you use on the stove to pop the kernels is also the bowl you serve the freshly popped popcorn in.
Make sure that the bowl is cool enough to be passed around or placed in someone's lap. If it's still too warm, put a dishtowel underneath it.

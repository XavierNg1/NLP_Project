Look for whole fish that smell clean. Avoid bruised sardines-you want the best product when you make sardines.






Stay away from old fish. Aged sardines will have "belly burn," a condition where the guts start to come out of the fish.





;
, When you prepare sardines, you want to remove all the rough skin. Rub your fingers back and forth over the sides, brushing off any remaining scales.
 To prepare sardines, cut the entire length of the fish's belly with a sharp fillet knife. Remove the innards and discard them.



Use the fillet knife to slice along each side of the backbone behind the ribs.






Cut underneath the ribs of the fresh sardine and slice upward, away from the backbone.






Use sharp scissors to snip the backbone where it connects to the head and where it meets the tail.






Remove the backbones with your thumb and forefinger before you cook sardines. Start at the tail and move your hand along the bone toward the head. As you move along the spine, lift the bone from the fish.
 To prepare sardines, add a little seasoning, such as salt and pepper.

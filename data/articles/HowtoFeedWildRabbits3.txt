 If you have wild rabbits in your yard that you want to feed, you need to make sure they understand where they can and cannot eat. Designate a rabbit friendly area of your garden, where you keep food they will like, and use some form of a barrier for other areas.


A good fence is the best option to form a barrier for your garden. Two foot high chicken wire is generally good enough to keep rabbits at bay. Make sure the bottom of the fence is staked securely to the ground so rabbits will not try to push underneath it.Scare devices, like a scare crow, scare tape, or a balloon may frighten rabbits and keep them out of areas of the garden where they're not welcome. Pinwheels sold primarily to repel moles may work on rabbits as well.Avoid the use of commercial pesticides, especially if you leave rabbit food out near your garden. Wind can blow traces of pesticide into nearby areas and, if ingested, the rabbits could get sick leaving them susceptible to predators., If you're feeding wild rabbits in your yard, they might end up building nests for litters nearby. A cat or a dog could easily disturb and destroy a nest. If this happens, try your best to restore it.


Return the grass, straw, and hay the rabbit used for the next to its original location. If the hole has been destroyed as well, dig a shallow hole, about 3 feet deep, and put the materials in there.If you find any of the mother's fur, put that back in the nest. This will help the mother find her babies if the nest has been moved or tampered with., Oftentimes, rabbits may become injured near your property. One of your pets may attack a wild rabbit or they could become injured by another predator. Try to secure the rabbit in a cage or crate. Wild animal traps can be purchased at some pet stores and online. Take the rabbit to a vet or rescue where it can get proper care and be re-released into the wild.

 Bumping a lock is a quick, simple lock picking technique that is useful in the case of having to open a door that's been closed for a long time (for example, of an unused home on family property), or if you need to break into an elderly relative's house to make sure they're okay.








Bumping a lock does take some practice, and especially in the case of cheaper locks, it can damage the lock, so don't use it without a good reason.;
, A bump key is a key that will fit the lock you want to bump, but which doesn't unlock it per se. As long as the key will fit in the lock, it can be turned into a bump key by filing every cut down to the lowest acceptable depth.









Most reputable locksmiths won't make a bump key for you, but you can sometimes find them online. To make one yourself, you'll need metalworking tools and some patience.
 Pin and tumbler locks are made of a round segment that turns once the pins inside line up and no longer block its motion. Every soft click you feel as you push a key into a lock is a pin being lifted by a tooth of the lock and then dropping onto the cut below it. Push your bump key in until there's one pin left that hasn't been lifted.
 Use a small rubber mallet or similar object to strike the bump key hard, and turn it immediately thereafter. Since the pins inside the lock are in two sections, this slamming motion transfers force to the lower sections (which rest inside the tumbler), which then transfer it to the upper sections (which keep the tumbler from moving). If all the upper pin sections are lifted in this way, the lock will be able to turn.









It may take a few tries to get the timing right, so keep at it until you're successful.

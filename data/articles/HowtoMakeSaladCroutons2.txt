 Fried croutons can end up with a chewy interior if they don't cook all the way through. Minimize this by starting with a loaf that's slightly dried out. Cut or tear the bread into cubes or pieces roughly ½ inch (1.25 cm) across.


If all you have is fresh bread, pre-toast the cubes in a 200ºF (90ºC) oven for ten minutes or until dry at the surface.Remove them from the oven and continue to the next step.
 Coat the base of the pan and heat until the butter has melted, or until the olive oil is shimmering. Butter burns at lower temperatures, so it tends to create darker croutons.
 Drop the bread cubes in the oil and mix until well coated. If the bread still looks dry, pour more melted butter or olive oil on top.
 Stir in salt and pepper to taste. Optionally, add dried Italian seasoning, or a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese.
 Fry the croutons over medium heat. Once the bases have browned, turn them to expose another side to the heat. The croutons are ready once they are mostly golden-brown, and smell toasted but not burned. Taste-test as you go if you're not sure whether the croutons are done.
 Transfer the croutons onto a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Leave the croutons to release steam and cool to room temperature before using or storing.


Once finished, store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. Transfer any leftovers to the freezer after that point.

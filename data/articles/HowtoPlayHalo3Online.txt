 You can't play something well if you aren't having fun. It's just a game right?;
, Know every nook and cranny of every map. You need to be able to get from point A to point B in as little time as possible because detours could result in a high amount of deaths and that spells trouble for you and your team. You will also need to know where the different weapons are located on the map so that you can use them more effectively.
 Obviously a shotgun is not going to be very effective from across the map. you should always carry at least one medium or long range weapon in your arsenal.
 If the other team is ranked higher than you, than maybe you might think about playing less aggressive and more conservative.
 If your shields are down, than find a good spot to stay in so that you can regenerate. This will help bring down the death margin.
 Vehicles are a good way to rack up some easy kills by splattering the enemy.
 Halo 3 is played at its best when friends come together and play with (or against) each other. Friends make excellent teammates and usually you play your best with them.
 If you know you are about to die, toss a grenade out there and you might a get a lucky kill but be careful not to kill your teammates!

, Buy yourself a headset if you don't already have one because the key to winning is good communication.
 Use your melee during close-quarters combat to bring down your opponent.
 Headshots damage the most especially with the sniper rifle.

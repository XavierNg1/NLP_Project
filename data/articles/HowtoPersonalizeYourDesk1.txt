DIY a perpetual calendar: attach 3 mug hooks to an inexpensive wood plaque, write the twelve months of the year as well as two sets of numbers (0-9) on blank gift tags. The tags hang on the hooks to display the date. Paint and customize the wood and tags to suit your taste., Unique magnets and push pins can be playful and useful. Customize pens and pencils, tape dispensers, staplers and other items you already own with patterned washi tape.

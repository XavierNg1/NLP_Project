 Are you doing pencil drawing? Just scribbling? Generally you'll want a piece of paper or notebook. For a pencil drawing, just use a No. 2 since you are practicing. Also if you are using a pencil, get an eraser. If you would like to color, use markers, colored pencils, paints, pastels, or anything else you would like. Try to get thick drawing paper at an art supply or craft store. Canvas paper or a drawing pad is recommended, but if you're just learning you might want to start with regular sheet paper.;
, Are you already good at drawing animals? Maybe you should focus on humans. If you're struggling with proportions you should try working on that during your practice. Figure out what it is that you want to improve so that you're not just drawing at random. Just drawing isn't necessarily going to make you better - you need targeted practice.


Free drawing is fine too if you want to work on your ability to create in the moment. Graffiti artists often free draw for this reason.
 Imagine going to the gym and doing five sit ups and then leaving. You’re not going to get in better shape doing that, and drawing for five minutes once a week probably won’t help you out either. Try to commit some serious time to drawing if you want to get better. Twenty minutes four days a week isn’t a huge time commitment but will be really beneficial.

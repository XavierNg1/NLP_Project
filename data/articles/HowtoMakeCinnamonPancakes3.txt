 Following the same recipe and instructions, make a batch of cinnamon pancake batter. Cinnamon roll pancakes combine the best parts of a pancake and a cinnamon roll, including the cinnamon swirl sauce and the icing.
 For the cinnamon topping, you will need the brown sugar, the cinnamon, and 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of the melted butter or margarine. Whisk the cinnamon swirl ingredients together in a medium bowl, and then transfer it to a pastry bag.If you don’t have a pastry bag, transfer the mixture to a re-sealable plastic bag instead.
 The remaining ingredients will be for the icing portion of the cinnamon roll pancakes, including the powdered sugar, milk, and the final tablespoon (15 ml) of melted butter. Whisk or beat these ingredients together in a medium bowl and set it aside. Add more milk (in very small increments) if the icing is too thick to drizzle.
 When it’s hot, pour the pancakes. Use one-quarter cup (60 ml) of batter as before. When the pancake begins to form bubbles in the center, get ready with your pastry bag of cinnamon sauce.
 Start in the center of the pancake and squeeze the cinnamon sauce into the pancake in a swirl pattern. Continue cooking for another minute, until the bubbles start to pop. Flip the pancake over and cook for another two minutes, until the other side is golden brown.If you are using a plastic bag instead of a pastry bag, snip off one of the bottom corners of the bag and gently squeeze the cinnamon sauce out through the small hole.
 When the pancake is cooked, drizzle it with a thin layer of icing. Alternatively, you can use a maple syrup drizzle instead to finish off the pancakes.

 Someone who is asleep will respond to stimuli. One way to determine if someone is sleeping is by talking to them. Kneel or bend next to the person and gently say their name, tell them to open their eyes, or ask them if they are all right. Repeat this for five minutes or until the person wakes up.For example, “Jim, are you awake? If you can hear me, open your eyes. Jim?”;
, Place your hand on their shoulder and gently shake them. You can do this in combination with saying their name or asking if they are awake. Do not shake them aggressively, shake their head, slap, or flick their face.You can also try gently rubbing their cheek or head/forehead to wake the person up.
 Turning on the radio or TV, closing the door, loudly tapping on something, or playing an instrument may prompt someone to wake up, as well. However, do not play or make loud noises too close to the person’s ear. This may startle the person or cause damage to their hearing.

 The rubber pad and the lino cutter tools may be found near the rubber stamping supplies but often they are found in the calligraphy or carving supplies. If you do not find them at your local craft store you may check in college book stores or there are sources online. You can also carve erasers. They are cheaper, but smaller.;
, For inspiration, use Google image search and choose black and white images. If you draw your own, draw a simple line drawing (think of what you see in children's coloring books).
, Pen works well.
, Start with small tools, and start in the tight areas. Remove the pink and leave the ink. Do not go too deep. Go straight down into the rubber, not at an angle. Make strokes that start near ink and move away from it. Let up pressure just before arriving at another ink mark. Remove tool and start from opposite side. When making curves, turn the pad, not the tool.
 Leave rubber around the edges.






Once removed, clean the edges area around the stamp with the largest tool.
 Use your tools to carefully remove any unwanted or stray marks.

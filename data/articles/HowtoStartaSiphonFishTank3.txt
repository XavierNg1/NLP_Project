 Another method for starting a siphon it to you use your mouth to initiate the suction. To accomplish this, first place your bucket on a surface lower than your fish tank.
 Next, place the vacuum end (larger opening) of your tube at the bottom of your fish tank. Keep the vacuum end a few inches above the gravel, unless you have a gravel vacuum attached. (If using a gravel vacuum, the tube can rest directly on the gravel.)

, To initiate the suction and get the water flowing, place your mouth on the discharge opening (the smaller end of the tube) and suck lightly. Ensure that the end of the tube is lower than the container from which you are siphoning water.
 As soon as the water begins to flow, quickly remove your mouth and place the discharge opening into your bucket. Then simply allow the water to flow. Move the vacuum end of the tube around the tank to suck up dirt and debris.
 When enough water has been removed, lift the discharge end of the tube so that it is higher than the fish tank. This will stop the flow of water. If you want to siphon more water, you will need to begin the procedure again.

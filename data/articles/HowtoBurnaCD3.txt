 In the resulting dialog box, click Burn files to data disc.





Name the disc in the Burn a Disc dialog box.
If you need a disc that will play in computers with an older version of Windows, or in media devices such as CD and DVD players that can read digital music and video files, click Show formatting options.
Click the Next button.
Your disc will be formatted for burning using the default LFS (Live File System) format. When finished formatting, an empty disc folder will open.
 Into the empty disc folder, drag the files you wish to burn.





You can drag the files onto the disc icon, or into the disc folder. The files are copied as you drag them.
 This will prepare the disc so that it can be used on other computers

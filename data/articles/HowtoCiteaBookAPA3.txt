 Type the editor's last name first, followed by his or her first and middle initials. If there are two editors, separate the names with an ampersand. If there are three or more editors, separate the names with a comma and place an ampersand in between the last two names. Indicate that these are editors by using the appropriate abbreviation afterward, "Ed." for one editor and "Eds." for multiple editors.

 The title should be italicized and ended with a period. The location and publisher information should be separated with a colon. Do not restate the editor after the title, as you would do in the basic format. You can, however, specify an edition number if one exists.

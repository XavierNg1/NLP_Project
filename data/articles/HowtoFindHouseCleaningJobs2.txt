 You can submit an application to a house cleaning company if you don’t feel comfortable advertising and meeting up with strangers. If your application is selected, the company will send jobs to you. Often, you can create your own hours and build a client base.You can also sign up for websites that cater to specific regions. For example, Queen of Maids provides service for many southwestern states in the US. My Clean provides services in New York City and Chicago. Search for websites that cater to your region.
 There are websites, like Care.com, that are made specifically for jobs dealing with house cleaning and other types of care. In many cases, you will have to create an online profile. You should write about your experience, post a photo (if you feel comfortable), and provide references. Once you do that, you will be able to apply to jobs and promote yourself., Unless the service and/or company requests it, you don’t have to stick to finding a house cleaning job through only one website. It will actually increase your chances of finding a job if you advertise or respond to jobs on as many websites as you can. To make this less time consuming, create an advertisement/profile for yourself and copy and paste it onto several websites. You can customize the advertisement if necessary.


For example, you can also search for jobs on websites like snagajob.com.

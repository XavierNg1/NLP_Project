Draw a bean like shape, not too curved and not too square like. That will be the base of the head.
Draw one triangle with about half a centimeter sort of close to the back invading the head.
Then draw another triangle behind the other ear only peeking out a tiny bit.
Now draw any eye you like close to the middle of the head but only a little bit before the center. You have now accomplished the head.;
,


From the back of the chin, draw a slight upside down bridge about half an inch down.
Then do the came thing from the back of the head except right side up. You have now finished the neck.

An upside down bridge means the opposite of a right side up bridge.



Draw a slightly big circle at the bottom of the neck. This will be the chest.
Draw triangles for the fur on the chest. The triangles should stay big. Not too big.

Make sure you have a triangle (if youâ€™re a kid) the size of your pinky, (grown up) a bit smaller than your pinky.



Draw a slightly curved line inwards for the back and the two shoulder blade lumps at the beginning of the line. The back should be horizontal.



Draw a curvy line for the stomach, mirroring the back.
The legs are hard. Start with two circles, one in front and one in the back. Then draw two lines down and a paw at each end. Draw the paw anyway you like.



Draw a tube like shape at the hindquarters and on the side that is closer to the body attach spikes for a wild look.

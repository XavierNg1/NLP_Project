 Pour the white wine vinegar into a small saucepan. Add the water, celery seeds, anise seeds, fennel seeds, peppercorns, coriander seeds, cloves, bay leaves, paprika, sea salt, and sliced shallots. Stir to combine.
 Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat. Let it reach a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue simmering the mixture for 2 to 3 minutes.Afterward, remove the saucepan from the stove and set it away from the heat. Let it cool for 5 to 10 minutes, or until it drops close to room temperature.
 Place the eggs in a sterilized 1-qt (1-L) jar. Pour the cooled vinegar mixture over the eggs.


You must use a jar that's been cleaned and sterilized with boiling water. If harmful bacteria gets introduced into the mixture, the pickled eggs could become tainted and dangerous to eat.
 Seal the container and place it in your refrigerator. Keep it there for at least 24 hours.
 Spoon the pickled quail eggs out of the vinegar mixture and enjoy them slightly chilled.


You can enjoy the pickled quail eggs as snacks, appetizers, or side dishes.
Store leftovers in the pickling liquid. Keep the container sealed and in your refrigerator, and use the eggs within two weeks.

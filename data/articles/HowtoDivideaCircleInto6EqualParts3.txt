 If you have a shortcut on your desktop, you can open the application by double-clicking on this icon. If you don’t have a shortcut, use the start menu or search for the application and open it from the search bar.
 The Polar Grid tool is one of the options in the toolbar on the left side of your screen. It is under the Line Segment group of tools. It kind of looks like a spider web; it is a circle with divided lines through it.To see the tools nested underneath the Line Segment, click and hold on the Line Segment tool until a window opens with more options.
Click on the Polar Grid tool to activate it.
 With the Polar Grid tool active, click on the canvas and drag the mouse to create the circle. You should see a circle appear that likely has smaller concentric circles within it. These can be removed later.While dragging, adjust the size of the circle by dragging in and out until you reach the desired size.
Hold ⇧ Shift to snap to a perfect circle.
Keep holding ⇧ Shift and don’t release the mouse click until you finish the next step.
 While dragging the circle, press on the right arrow key until you see that the circle has been divided into 6 equal parts. If you accidentally press the key too many times, simply push the left arrow key to decrease the number of divisions.When the circle is the size you want and divided into 6 equal parts, you can let go of the mouse.
If you let go of the mouse too early, there is an alternative method: Keep the Polar Grid tool active (don’t click back to the black arrow) and click on any whitespace in your document. An options menu will pop up and you can set the number of divisions to 6 and remove the concentric dividers by setting that option to 0.

 Depending on what you hope to accomplish (both good tasting and healthy) consider using fruit juice concentrate. Check the sugar content on the label if you're looking for the healthiest option.


Choose juice you know your child will enjoy. If this is the first time you're making these snacks, go with something tried and true. Once your child is used to them (and will most likely ask for them), you can expand your horizons.






Go for organic. Organic juice concentrate will include less chemicals and/or added ingredients for the healthiest option.

, Only use unflavored gelatin so it wonâ€™t interfere with the juice flavor.


Look for molds that will create smaller shapes, similar to the pre-packaged fruit snacks.






Consider buying molds for different holidays. For added fun, investigate molds that come in shapes like skulls or pumpkins for Halloween, or snowmen for winter holidays.
 Combine 1/3 cup of fruit juice concentrate with 2-3 (25 ounce/740ml) envelopes of unflavored gelatin.


Pour juice in the saucepan first, then sprinkle the gelatin over the juice. Allow the juice and gelatin to sit for a few minutes to combine.






Turn your stove to medium heat and place the pan over the burner. Stir mixture until the gelatin is fully dissolved.
 Transferring the juice to an easy-to-pour container will make it easier to pour into the molds.
 Make sure you fill the mold all the way to the top without allowing the juice to flow over.


Leave the molds on the counter for 20 minutes so they set. The molds should be ready to eat after approximately 20 minutes, however you can increase the readiness by placing your molds in the refrigerator.

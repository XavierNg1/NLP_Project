 To create a bleach solution to soak your laundry, you need to dilute the bleach with cold water. The amount of bleach that you need depends on how large a load you’re soaking. Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of bleach for every 1 gallon (3.8 l) of cold water up to 5 gallons (19 l).Make sure to choose the right bleach for your laundry. Only use chlorine bleach for white items. Use an all-fabric bleach for colored items.
Make sure that your laundry has already been washed before soaking it in the bleach.
 Once you’ve created the bleach solution, place your laundry in the water. Allow the items to soak in the water for at least 15 minutes.If you’re soaking laundry that is especially prone to germs, such as cloth diapers or an ill person’s bedding, you should let it soak for at least 30 minutes.
Never leave the laundry in the bleach solution for more than 45 minutes.
 After your laundry has soaked for the appropriate amount of time, use hot water to rinse them thoroughly. Next, put them in your washer and wash as you normally would with hot water to completely remove the bleach.Be sure to read the care labels on your laundry to verify that they can be washed in hot water.

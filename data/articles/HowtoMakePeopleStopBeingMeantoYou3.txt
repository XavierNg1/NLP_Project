 Bullying is not a joke and you shouldn’t be afraid of talking to someone about it. If you’ve tried to deal with the problem on your own and had no success, think about who you trust. Try talking to a teacher or playground attendant. If you’re not comfortable with them, go to your parents. Your parents can represent you and help you talk to the teachers directly. No matter what, bullying is serious and never be afraid you’re being a tattle-tail by telling an adult. if anyone calls you a tattle tale, they are wrong. sometimes bullies will stop as soon as they think an adult knows, because they are scared of trouble.


Sometimes all the bully needs to get scared is to know an adult has been told. Even if the adult doesn’t talk to them, the bully may be scared out of talking to you again.Explain yourself clearly. If you say you’re being “bugged” at school, the adult might not understand. Tell them plainly, “I am being bullied and need help.”, When you ask an adult for help, you can tell them what you want done. Maybe you want the adult to step in when they see the meanie on your case, or perhaps you want to learn how to stand up to the bully. Either way, teachers are trained to deal with bullying.They can help guide you based on the situation you’re in.


If the first adult you talk to doesn’t help you, don’t stop there. Bullying is never okay and if you can’t get help, ask someone else.Keep on asking until you find someone.

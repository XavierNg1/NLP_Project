 Regular exercise can help you cope with Crohn’s Disease by boosting your immune system and reducing stress. Since both Crohn’s Disease and periods can cause fatigue, you might find it difficult to keep up a healthy routine. If that's the case, try doing thirty minutes of a low intensity activity at least three times a week.These activities might include:


Taking a walk
Yoga
Swimming
Tai Chi

, Stress and elevated hormones can both cause flares of Crohn’s Disease. If you’re feeling tense, overwhelmed, or tired, try meditating.In a quiet room, find a seat, and close your eyes. Start breathing in and out, focusing only on your breath. Try not to think about any stress, pain, worries, or anxieties that you might have. Every time you catch your mind wandering, bring it back to your breath.


Soft music and sounds of nature may help you meditate.
Try not to fall asleep while meditating. If you do, try again another day.
 Biofeedback is a type of therapy that helps you measure and control your vital functions, such as muscle control and heart rate. A doctor or therapist will attach you to a machine that will provide readings of your bodily functions. The doctor will help you respond to control these functions. Some people may use biofeedback to control their Crohn's flares.Some apps and computer programs can also help you measure blood pressure, heart rate, and muscle tension.

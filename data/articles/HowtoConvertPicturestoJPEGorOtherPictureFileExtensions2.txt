 For the most common file conversions, default image editors can usually do the job. If not you can search the internet to find the correct software to help you with your conversion. Try searching "extensionA to extensionB" with your specific file extensions inserted in the search query.


For instance, a search of "doc to pdf" or "jpg to gif" brings up several free online converter options.
 Most conversion services are offered free of charge and without the need for a software download. Look first for an option that instructs you to upload your image file for the conversion.
 Sometimes a conversion site will ask for your email and then email the finished file to you after the conversion is complete. Other times you may be able to wait a few moments and then download the file directly.


Be wary of websites asking for payment or for an excess of personal details in order to convert your files - remember that many free resources exist and you shouldn't have to give more than your email address in the majority of cases.

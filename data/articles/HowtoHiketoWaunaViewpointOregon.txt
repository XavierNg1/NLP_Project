 You will need a Northwest Forest Pass in order to park at this trailhead.


If you're coming from Portland, take exit 40 from I-84. Make a right at the stop sign and a left when the road splits.
You might notice many people taking a right; this is the way to the Wahclella Falls trailhead, a much more popular hike.
Follow the road up the hill to the spacious trailhead parking lot.;
, Look carefully to your right for a junction with a trail going uphill.


It's marked by a sign that says "Tanner Butte Trail".
 Follow the trail to the right.


At this junction is a sign marked "Trail 400/Wauna Pt/Tanner Butte Tr".
 You will want to follow the trail closest to your left.


Look for a sign that says "Gorge Trail 400" with arrows pointing left and right. Follow the trail to the left of that sign.



It's hard to miss. The left trail goes downhill and the right trail goes uphill.



As of January 2015, the trail has a small detour cutting up the switchbacks to get around landslide debris. If you see the trail split and a branch strategically placed on the trail going left like this, head up to the right. Otherwise you'll end up scrambling over the landslide debris to find the trail again.

 This cake takes 20 minutes to prepare, 1 hour and 10 minutes to cook and serves roughly eight people. This recipe resembles a banana bread, but is a little sweeter, with a thinner batter suited for cakes., You can use any sort of baking dish that you'd like, of course, but loaf dishes are nice and deep, allowing you to get thick, moist center to your bread. You can just as easily pour the batter into pie tins, a bunt cake, or any other baking dish.
 Beat using an electric mixer until the ingredients are combined in a light, consistent color, about one minute. If you don't sift the flour, whip it up with a fork at least -- this breaks up big clumps of flour to ensure that everything gets melted and mixed together well.
 Melt the butter slowly, in 15-20 second bursts, so that it is liquid but not hot. Then mash up your bananas, blending well. The more ripe the banana is, the better it will be. Dark brown bananas are often your best bet.You can pre-mash the bananas easily on a plate with the back of a large., Flour actually toughens up as you mix it, leading to chewier, less tender cakes. Just mix the flour in until their are no more dry bits and everything is taken one consistent batter.
 The cake is done when you can pierce it with a knife or wooden skewer and the blade comes out clean, with only a few crumbs. If the skewer comes out with wet batter on it, let the cake cook for an additional 5 minutes or so and try again.
 When ready, tip it out and allow to cool on a wire cooling rack. Allow to cool completely if you are adding icing or frosting, as the heat will make even frosting impossible.

 Make sure you don't call any sooner (to either park) no sooner than October 1st. For Walt Disney World guests, you can dial (407) 939-5277, or for Disneyland (CA) you may end up calling 1- (714) 781-INFOor contact either park by the web form located on the Walt Disney World website or the Disneyland website respectively. These two places are very verifiable sources of information to help you plan around the date in which to visit the park.


Although the dates vary by calendar year and park location and a load of other factors, plan to visit the Disney Parks (especially the Magic Kingdom) sometime between the very first Friday in November (for Disneyland audiences) and on the weekend that falls nine days after Thanksgiving, roughly the last weekend in November or first week of December (for the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World audiences ).
Make sure that Disneyland and Walt Disney World employees don't convince you that this event is the same regular parade as the nighttime and afternoon parades that air daily on the same parade route.;
,, It can take up to 2 1/2 to 3 hours to tape this program, as they will allot for a "dry practice run" followed by a taping of just the audio track followed by the taping of the video track of the activities., The stage appearance sometimes will be taped before the parade, which will be spread out over several tries and retries and, by itself, can last no shorter than two hours by itself., Go with the flow. Wear a red Santa cap (with or without a bell). But make sure you look casual, and the remainder of your clothes won't make you stand out from any of the other guests in the area of the park.

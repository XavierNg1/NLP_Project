 If you need to master certain vocabulary words for a test, then making flashcards is a great way to commit these words to memory. To make flashcard, write the word on one side of an index card and then write the definition of the word on the other side.


You might also find it helpful to provide yourself with an example of how to use the word in a sentence.
Keep the flashcards with you and study them whenever you have a few spare minutes. For example, you can study your flashcards while waiting in line or riding the bus., Reading is an excellent way to improve your vocabulary and grammar skills.Try to discover a book or series of books that you enjoy and read during your spare time.


Read as much as possible and choose books that are slightly challenging for you.
Look up words that you do not understand when you are reading. Make sure to make a note of the wordâ€™s definition as well.
 Using new words will help you to remember them and figure out how to use them. Try to use the new words that you learn as often as you can.


For example, you might try out a new word in a conversation with a friend or include a few of the new words that you have learned in an English essay. Keeping a journal where you try out new words is another great option., If you struggle with English sometimes, then getting a tutor from the writing center at your school may help you to develop your skills.A tutor can work with you on any areas that give you trouble, such as grammar, vocabulary, or reading.


Most schools provide tutor services to students as a free benefit. Your fees and tuition help to cover the costs of providing these services.

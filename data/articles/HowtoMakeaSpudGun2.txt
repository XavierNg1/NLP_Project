 The bicycle grip or tricycle handle will be mounted to one end of the dowel. If you have modern handlebar tape, you can simply wrap it around one end of the dowel. Handlebar tape comes with an adhesive side. Attach the tricycle handle using tape.


If you messed up one side of your dowel, attach the grip to this side.
Wrap tape around the tricycle handle and the dowel until it feels secure.
 Insert the dowel into the piping. If you went to the hardware store for the proper sizes, the dowel should fit. You will probably need to sand the dowel down slightly. Sanding the dowel will make it easier to push through the piping.


Again, hold the sandpaper in your palm with the coarse side facing out. Then twist and stroke the dowel in small increments with the sandpaper.
Take caution when sanding down the dowel. You don’t want to create too large of a gap. The spud gun functions based off of air pressure. The source of air pressure is between the tightness of the dowel and piping.
 Wedge one side of the piping into a potato. When you remove it, there should be a chunk of potato in the pipe. Insert the dowel at the opposite end of the piping. Keep the dowel crowned in the pipe until you’re ready to fire.


With all of your force, jam the dowel towards the potato. The piece of spud should go hurling out of your contraption.
You should hear a popping sound and a faint hint of smoke (potato debris)., If the spud didn’t shoot, you may need to take a look at your contraption. Make sure that the piping is straight and smooth. Look over pipe for any dents and ensure the pathway is clear. Check if your pipe has a rough edge around the opening. File it down if there is a sharp edge.


Use either a nail file or a metal file depending on what type of pipe you are using.
Check to see if the spud is wedged firmly in the pipe. There can’t be any gaps for the spud to successfully fire. Also, you’ll need to empty the spud from the piping completely before reloading.

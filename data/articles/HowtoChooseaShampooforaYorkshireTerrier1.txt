 A Yorkshire terrier’s coat is different from most dogs. While most dogs have double coats, and either cottony or wiry hair, Yorkshire terriers tend to have a single coat with human-like hair. Yorkshire terriers also have very sensitive skin.Before buying a shampoo, ask your vet for recommendations to ensure that you are selecting a shampoo that will meet your yorkie’s needs.;
, It is recommended that you never use human shampoo to clean your dog’s hair. Human shampoos are formulated for human hair and skin. Human hair and skin have a lower pH balance, i.e., are more acidic. In comparison, dog hair and skin have a higher pH, i.e., are more alkaline.


By using human shampoo, you are disrupting your dog’s pH balance. This can lead to or exacerbate skin and hair problems.Choose a dog shampoo that has a pH in the neutral range, for example, 7 or higher. Some shampoos list the pH level on their shampoo. If they do not, it should clearly state that the shampoo is pH-balanced for dogs., While some Yorkshire terriers tend to have long, silky human-like hair, other yorkies can have short, cottony or wiry coats. Therefore, select a shampoo based on the length of your yorkie’s hair.If your yorkie has long hair, choose a shampoo for dogs with medium to long hair.
If your yorkie has shorter hair, choose a shampoo for dogs with short, cottony or wiry coats.

 Installing an energy efficient overhead light, track light, or recessed light can look great in any area. Consider an Energy Star approved fixture to help conserve energy at the same time you’re adding brightness., Lighting up a dark corner of a room can make it feel cozier, brighter, and more inviting., Lighting can make a world of difference in any room. You can literally brighten things up by something as simple as changing that old light fixture to a more modern, clear one that lets the light shine through unhindered.
 Swap your existing bulbs for some with higher lumens to intensify the light in your room. LED and CFL bulbs are an excellent choice, since they provide the same quality of lighting you’re used to, but they use very little power. LEDs can last up to 6 times longer than CFLs and 50 times longer than incandescent bulbs., Mirrors are, hands down, the very best accessory you can add to help enhance existing light and make your room appear larger. Light that reflects off of a mirror doubles the light in any room! If possible, hang a large mirror directly across from a window to get the best results.
 Add crystals, rhinestones, and other shiny objects to lamps or vases. Place these on tabletops and bookshelves to bring a bit of light into areas that may otherwise be dull and boring. Add metallic finishes to shelves and frames to help reflect light and brighten up your room.

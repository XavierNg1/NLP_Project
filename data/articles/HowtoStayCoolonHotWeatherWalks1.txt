 Instead of walking on the sunny side of the street, walk along the side of the street that provides tree cover. Alternately, take a hot weather walk in the woods of your nearest public park, where tree cover keeps temperatures low.If shade is available only intermittently along your walking path, rest beneath patches of trees or other sources of shade to cool down, at least temporarily.;
, Walking next to a lake, along the beach by the ocean, or on a higher elevation may be cooler because there is often a breeze in these places. If you have some options about where you go walking, opt for someplace that is more likely to be breezy.
 Going out for a hot weather walk doesnâ€™t require that you walk during the hottest part of the day. Walk in the evening or early morning (close to dawn) to prevent walking during the hottest part of the day.The hottest part of the day is usually between 3:00 and 6:00 in the afternoon.Check your local forecast before heading out. If your local temperature is 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) or above, exercise caution and keep your weather walk brief. If your local temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or more, many healthcare experts would advise against going on a hot weather walk.
 Take it easy when exercising in hot weather, especially if you do not typically walk or work out in hot weather. Start slowly at first, and gradually increase the intensity and speed of your walk.If you do typically walk or workout, but not in heat, adopt a slower-than-usual pace when out on a hot weather walk. Increase your speed after a few minutes if you feel up to it.
The amount of time needed to acclimate to hot weather varies from person to person. Hot weather walks will feel uncomfortable, but if you get dizzy, nauseous, or fatigued, slow your pace or consider ending your hot weather walk.

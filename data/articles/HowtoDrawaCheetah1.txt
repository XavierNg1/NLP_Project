 Sketch a simple circle with an oval for the mouth and two round-sided triangles for the ears. Make sure the head isn’t too oversized for your paper, since you still have to fit in the rest of the cheetah’s body in proportion to it.;
, There should be two concentric arcs swooping from the snout to the ears, as well as small circles for the eye(s)/nose and a line to depict a slight snarl.
 Use shapes as guides for it. Draw three ovals: a small one for the neck, a large one for the upper body, and a medium one for the back. Add in circles to connect these shapes. Remember, a cheetah's body is longer in comparison to other big cats, so incorporate that into your drawing.
 Each leg has three ovals again, a large one at the top and two smaller ones at the bottom. Draw larger versions of these for the back legs.
 Don't forget to add a long tail! At this point you might be running out of room on the page, so if you want your cheetah’s tail can be raised up in alarm or curled between his legs.
 Don't forget to add its trademark spots! The image here displays generous application of fairly small spots onto the cheetah, but they can be as big/little/plentiful/sparse as you like. And in fact, they don’t even need to be spots, since some cheetahs have splotchy markings and some don’t have any pattern on their coats all.  After that erase anything outside your black line.
 Use yellow/gold for the majority of the body, with dark brown/black for the spots. You’re done!

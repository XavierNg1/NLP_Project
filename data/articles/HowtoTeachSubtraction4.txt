 The Common Core presents the concept of subtraction as measuring the distance between two points. To demonstrate this to your students, draw a number line ranging from 0 to 10 on the board as a visual.


Provide your students with a basic subtraction problem: 9-4=?.
Locate the number 4 on your number line. This is your starting point.
Locate the number 9 on your number line. This is your final destination.
Measure, or count the distance between the two points: “5, 6, 7, 8, 9.”
The distance is five. Therefore, 9-4=5., When solving a two-digit subtraction problem, explain to your students that there are more stopping points along the way to the final destination.


Provide your students with a two-digit subtraction problem: 73-31=?.
Locate the number 31 on your number line. This is your starting point.
Locate the number 73 on your number line. This is your final destination.
"Stop” at the next tens place. Move from 31 to 40. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 9.
"Stop” at the tens place nearest 73. Move from 40 to 70. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 30.
"Drive” to your final destination. Move from 70 to 73. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 3.
Add together the three measurements: 9+30+3=42. Therefore, 73-31=42., When solving a two-digit subtraction problem, explain to your students that in addition to making extra stops, the distance between the stops will be greater.


Provide your students with a three-digit subtraction problem: 815-398=?.
Locate the number 398 on your number line. This is your starting point.
Locate the number 815 on your number line. This is your final destination.
"Stop” at the next tens place. Move from 398 to 400. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 2.
"Stop” at the hundreds place nearest 815. Move from 400 to 800. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 400.
"Stop at the tens place nearest 815. Move from 800 to 810. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 10.
"Drive” to your final destination. Move from 810 to 815. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 5.
Add together the 4 measurements: 2+400+10+5=417. Therefore, 815-398-417.

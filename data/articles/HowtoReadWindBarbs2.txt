 Run a web search for "wind barbs " or visit the website for a local weather station.Read the wind direction that the wind barbs show. The direction of the main line of the wind barbs shows you the direction from which the wind is coming.


Remember: the orientation of the line from the compass represents the incoming direction – not which way the wind is blowing. This designation can be confusing if you aren't used to it.
 In order to interpret wind direction, you will need to know which way is north. Wind barbs are usually provided within a directional context – but if not, make sure you orient them with north at the top.
 Wind barbs almost always display wind speed in terms of knots. However, it may come in handy to know the wind speed in another unit of velocity. One knot is equal to 1.15 miles per hour (mph) and 1.9 kilometers per hour (kph).In order to calculate miles per hour, simply add 15% to the value in knots.60 knots to mph: 15% of 60 is 9. 60+9 = 69 . Thus, 60 knots is equivalent to 69 mph.
 When you know how fast the wind is going, you can apply the measurement to various safety measures. Notably, this includes burn bans and other effective fire prevention strategies.

 There are many ways to cite your information within a text depending on the citation style, including footnotes or merely an author's last name. APA in-text citations follow the information you're citing, and use the title of the report in parentheses before the punctuation. They do not use footnotes.An example would be: "According to XYZ's annual report, the company failed to meet profit expectations during the first quarter (citation)."

, The specific information that goes in the parentheses is important. This will let people reading your work follow up on your sources, both for verification purposes but also to help with their own research. Include the title of the report, the report's date, and the page number within the parentheses.For example: (XYZ Corp 2010, p. 210).
 While citations are important for helping other researchers, they are also an important part of intellectual honesty. Any ideas, statistics, or quotes that you take directly from the annual report, should be cited with specific place you pulled the information from.


When in doubt, it is better to cite too much than risk plagiarism or intellectual dishonesty.

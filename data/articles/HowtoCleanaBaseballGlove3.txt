 Before storing your glove, at either the beginning or the end of the baseball season, give your glove a gentle scrubbing with water and soap. Dab a clean cloth into a mixture of warm water and mild hand soap. Wring the cloth out as much as possible to avoid causing the glove to absorb too much water. Dry the glove with a dry cloth after wiping it down, then allow it to air dry.Do not use dishwashing liquid or detergent to wipe your glove.
 When you aren’t using your glove, store it somewhere with a stable temperature. Avoid leaving your glove near a heater or in a hot area (for instance, next to a window that receive direct sunlight). This will cause your glove to dry out, and become stiff and unusable., If your glove gets too wet, it will become stiff and less pliant when it dries. Keep your glove somewhere with low humidity and adequate air flow.If your baseball glove gets wet – even as a result of rain during a game – wipe it off as soon as possible. Allow it to dry naturally.
Don’t dry your glove with a blow dryer, or place it near a heater. This could cause it to crack.If, after your glove dries, it feels too stiff, apply glove conditioner to soften it.
 When you store your glove, don’t pile heavy baseball bats or other sports equipment on it. Place a baseball in the webbing and wrap the glove tightly with an elastic cord or other binder. Tighten or re-tie the laces using square and overhand knots.Place the glove with the palm up or facing to the side. Proper storage will help the glove keep its shape.

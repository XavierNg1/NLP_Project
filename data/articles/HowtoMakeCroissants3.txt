 Lightly butter the baking sheet you plan to use. Lay a piece of wax paper over a second baking sheet. Dust the countertop with flour. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, and let it rest on the countertop for 10 minutes. Finally, roll the dough into a 20x5-inch rectangle (50x12 cm).
 Use a pizza cutter or a knife to cut the dough in half lengthwise. You should end up with two 10x5-inch (25x12 cm) pieces of dough. Place one piece of dough on the baking sheet covered in wax paper. Put another layer of wax paper on top.
 Make two width-wise cuts on the strip of dough. Place two of the squares on the wax paper baking sheet. There should be a layer of wax paper separating them from your larger rectangle of dough. Put the baking sheet in the fridge to keep the butter chilled.
 You'll end up with two triangles, which will become your croissants.
 Starting at the widest side, roll the dough upward to the top of the triangle. Form it into a crescent, and place it on the buttered baking sheet so that the top of the triangle is pinned to the sheet by the croissant. Repeat with the second dough triangle.
 Remove another dough square from the refrigerator. Repeat the cutting and rolling process. Continue removing squares from the refrigerator, cutting them into triangles, and rolling the triangles into croissants until you run out of dough. You should end up with 8 croissants on your buttered baking sheet.
 Cover the baking sheet loosely with a clean dishtowel, and allow the croissants to rise for an hour.

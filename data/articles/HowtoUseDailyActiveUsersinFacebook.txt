 Go to your Insights panel and select the "Users" report. This is found on the left hand side of the Insights panel.;
, About midway down this report you will find a Daily Active Users Breakdown chart. You will need to hover your mouse above the different statistics in order to find out more information. The information currently available is:


Unique Page Views – This is the number of Facebook participants per day who have actually viewed your Facebook page.
Post Views – Here you will see how many people have viewed your Facebook posts for the day. This number also represents what has been viewed by way of news feeds.
Liked a Post – This amount represents the amount of fans who have liked one of your posts.
Commented on a Post – Obviously, this is the amount of fans who have commented on one of your posts.
Wall Posts – This represents how many fans have posted to your Page, whether it's comments, photos, links, etc.
 Don't try to analyze the data daily. To do so would create a very unrealistic and uneven picture of daily interactions with your Page. Instead, aim to assess the figures weekly and monthly, to get a sense of the trends evolving. Things to bear in mind include:


Page views: A lower number here is usual unless you have a broad group of many fans.
Unique Page views: A higher number here is usual if you have a small fan base.
Liked a Post: A high number here means that there may be something you've added that's worth further investigation and repeating.

 This may be hard but you must do it. Now to become a better person you must do this step, because this is the most important step. If you don't accomplish this step you will get nowhere.;
, If you have made enemies in you life, and which everybody does. If you have ever done anything hurtful to anyone or they think that you did something wrong, you must ask for forgiveness. Even if you think you haven't done anything wrong, just ask for forgiveness anyway. If someone doesn't forgive you then you must think to yourself that you did your part and be proud and move on.
 The way you find God doesn't mean you have to go to church. You find God with not your mind but your heart. You see the only way you find God is if you ask him in your life, but you must be truthfully honest with this step because God knows if you're lying. Once you ask him in your life and accept him in your life then this is the big turning point in your life.
 Now that you have God, this is the part where the Devil tries to get at you, because he doesn't want you to do good things he wants you to ignore God and do horrible things. This stage is always tough because you have to fight back and say no to the Devil. You must ask God to be with you more than ever during this part of your life.
 Now no one is perfect so you may still do some things wrong but here's the good part. You still have God and ask him to forgive you of your sins and he will. Now doesn't that sound amazing? I asked God to be in my life two years ago and I've had a few rough patches here and there but hey, everyone has those day's that aren't good. So this is the part where I end this particular advice. You must make a decision to become a better person and accept God into your life or not.

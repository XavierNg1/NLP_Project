 Cats are mice's natural predators, and their presence will go a long way toward keeping the mice population on your property under control. Both indoor and outdoor cats are excellent mouse deterrents.;
, Certain substances are known to repel mice. Place one of these items in the corners of your basement, closets, doors, and other place you suspect mice may be entering:


Mint. Mint plants planted around your windows and doors will repel mice. You could also sprinkle peppermint or spearmint essential oil around your house.
Bay leaves. Tuck them into the corners of your pantry and cabinets, or crush them up and sprinkle them in your windowsills.
Mothballs. These will keep mice away, but they're poisonous to humans and pets. If you use mothballs, make sure your children, dogs and cats can't get near them.
 Place them in areas where you think mice are entering or have entered your home.


Try live traps. Mice are lured inside by peanut butter or cheese, and when the door closes behind them they can't get back out. Release live mice in an area away from your home.
Spring or glue traps are also effective, but you risk catching wild animals with them if you place them outside.
 Purchase bait boxes at a home improvement store. They typically feature a box and poison bait, or you can purchase bait stations which are already baited. Think twice about using these if you have children or pets who may be attracted to them.


Place poisonous bait stations around the outside of your home, targeting areas where you suspect mice are entering your home.
If you find a mouse that has died from the poison, dispose of it right away. If another animal eats the mouse, it will also be poisoned.

 Colds can often lead to sinus congestion, which in turn, block your eustachian tubesâ€”which are connected to your middle ear and the back of your nose. When this gets stopped up, it can lead to a great deal of pain.;
, Not only is this good for blockage due to colds, it's also very handy for pilots, airline passengers, and divers.








Pinch your nose to plug your nostrils. Exhale like you are trying to breathe out of your nose. Resist the urge to blow too hard as it might hurt the eardrum.
There may be a small pop sound associated with the relief of pressure when using this remedy but it should not be accompanied by any pain.
 This will help clear the sinuses, and return your hearing to some semblance of normalcy.
 In the event your sinus blockage is caused by allergies, an antihistamine may be just the thing you need.
 If your ear pain is serious, see your doctor or specialist, who may prescribe meds such as topical nasal steroids, or use ventilation tubes to drain any fluid and relieve pressure.

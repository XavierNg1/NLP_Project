 For those who played GTA games already knows that most missions will give you a certain amount of money.;
, Dying or getting busted will make you lose a bit of money. Granted, you won't lose a huge amount but it seriously will add up if you keep getting killed or busted.
 Weapons in the shop is always too expensive or really unreasonable, so consider looking around the entire island for the weapons. Also you can find free health around the islands by collecting the icons with the heart or by hopping into an ambulance.
 Those things would give you some money each time you collect them. Also the game will hand out free weapons when certain amounts has been collected.

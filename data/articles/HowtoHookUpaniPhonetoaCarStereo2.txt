 Look at the face of your car’s head unit and check if there’s a 3.5 mm audio port, similar to the headphone port your iPhone has. Car stereos have built-in auxiliary ports to support MP3 players, smartphones, and other music playing devices.


Check your car stereo’s manual if you can’t find or are unsure whether the head unit has an auxiliary port.
 An audio auxiliary cable is a type of cord connector that has an audio jack on each end that lets you connect any music-playing gadget to any electronic device that has an auxiliary port. You can buy it from any electronic store for around $2 to $5 US dollars.
 Plug one end of the audio auxiliary cable to the headphone port of your iPhone. Take the other end of the cable and plug it to the auxiliary port on the car stereo.
 Press the menu button on your car stereo and set it to auxiliary (AUX) mode. This will allow your car stereo to receive any information coming from your iPhone.


Check your car stereo’s manual if you do not know how to set your specific car stereo to auxiliary mode.
 Open your iPhone’s music app to start playing your music on your car’s entertainment system. If you place or receive a call, your car speakers will act as your iPhone speaker and hear the voice of the person you’re talking to.

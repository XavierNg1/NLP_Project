 Visit instagram.com and log in with your Instagram or Facebook account. You'll need to be logged in with your account in order to block someone.
 There are a few ways you can find the person you're looking for.


Click the search bar at the top of the page and type in the username you want to block.
Click on a user's name in your feed or in the comments of someone's post.
 The button will say "Follow" if you're not following the person, and "Following" if you are. Click the "..." button next to it.
 You will immediately block the user and unfollow them. The blocked user will no longer be able to see your photos or videos, and your profile will not appear in their searches. Users are not notified when you block them.
 After blocking someone, you can unblock and follow them again by clicking the "Follow" button at the top of their profile. There is no list of accounts you've blocked, so you'll need to manually search for accounts you wish to unblock.


If you just want to unblock someone but don't want to follow them, click the "..." button on their profile again and select "Unblock this user."

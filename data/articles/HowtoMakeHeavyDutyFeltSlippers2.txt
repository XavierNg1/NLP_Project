 Trace the bottom/sole of your shoe on one sheet of the felt fabric. Trace both shoes (so you have a left and a right shoe).


Cut out both shoe bottoms.
 Create the template by doubling the length of the slipper size and then adding a rounded top (so the design ends up looking somewhat like a golf club). #*Hold the template up to each shoe sole. You want the thin end to begin around the baby toe area of the shoe and then it will be wrapped around the back and over the top of the shoe.


Cut out a side and top template for each shoe (the template will look reversed for left versus right shoe).
 Space your holes accordingly since you only have a few strings to use.

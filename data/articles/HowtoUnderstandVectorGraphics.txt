Simply put, a raster image is stored in terms of a list of pixels in a grid and what color they are. If a person were to describe a raster image to another person, it would be like handing somebody a piece of grid paper and saying, "Color the first square white. Now color the second square light blue," and so on.
An svg is also an xml file, and it is possible to see the code by opening the image file with a text editor.
For a raster image, making the image bigger just makes those squares bigger. If you zoom in far enough on a raster image (such a bitmap or JPEG), you will see pixels (short for picture elements) the little squares that make up the image. Vector images are infinitely scalable; you can scale a vector file to any size without seeing pixels.;
, A vector is simply a magnitude and a direction. A magnitude can be the length of a line, or it can be something like how fast a thing is going.


If somebody is headed east at four miles per hour, his velocity can be described as a vector.
A line can be described as a vector, too, by stating the angle of that line and its length. It's this kind of idea that makes up vector images.
 They could also be described as consisting of a series of connected lines.


If a person were to describe a vector image to another person, she might say something like, "Start in the lower left corner of the page and draw a thick, green line. Start it upward at a 72 degree angle, but curve to the right so that it ends at the right side of the image at a 60 degree angle," and so on.
Because vector images are defined this way mathematically, a computer can display them at any scale with no loss of definition.

To edit vectors, you need to edit nodes (however your software does it)

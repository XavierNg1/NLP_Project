 Making sure there are good seals on the doors and windows leads to huge savings in energy costs. Insulation keeps your home from leaking cool air-conditioned air during the summer and warm heated air during the winter.


Have a contractor inspect your home's insulation to determine whether it's efficient enough. Consider the attic, crawlspaces, basement, walls and ceiling. You may want to look into fitting your home with new insulation.
Weather-strip your home by using caulk and weather strip in your doorways, windows and around window air conditioners. You can also purchase plastic sheeting to put over the windows during the winter.
 Heating water takes a lot of energy. It's not necessary to take cold showers, but being mindful of how much hot water you use, and how the water is being heated, can save a lot of electricity and money.


Make sure your water heater is insulated so that it isn't losing too much heat.
Consider getting a water heater that doesn't run on a continuously lit pilot light.
Take showers instead of baths. Baths use a lot more water than showers.
Take shorter showers. Spending 20 minutes in the shower uses up a lot of electricity

, Sometimes it's unavoidable to use the air conditioner, but there's no reason to have it on from the beginning of spring to the end of the summer without ever turning it off. Find other ways to cool yourself down when possible.
 You save a lot of energy and money by keeping your home a few degrees lower than normal during the winter. If you get cold, put on a sweater instead of turning up the thermostat.

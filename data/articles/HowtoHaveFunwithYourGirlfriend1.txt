 Picnics are romantic, scenic, and a great change of pace. They can be simple—try sharing sandwiches on a park bench during her lunch break. They can also be elaborate. Pack a proper basket with a large, sturdy blanket you can both lie down on. Bring a full meal as well as water and white wine. Drive somewhere with running water, and chill the wine in the water while you set up your picnic.


Pack food you can eat with your hands and share.
Great picnic foods include: pan-bagnat, a fresh baguette with ham and butter or fancy cheese, hummus and carrots, grapes, peaches, and chocolate.;
, Shopping is boring, but hunting and gathering is fun. Stock up on flowers, produce, and artisanal delicacies at your local farmer's market. If your town doesn't have one, find one nearby and drive or take a bus. Farmer's markets are a great way to start a day together: go for breakfast, buy coffee, fruit, and pastry, and sit outside to enjoy the hustle bustle.


Find silly junk for one another at a flea market or a yard sale. You might find useful things, but the goal should be to enjoy the scenery.
During harvest seasons, visit a U-Pick. Spend the day wandering the orchard or fields together, and pick only what you actually want.
 If you have the time, the money, and the guts, do something unusual from your shared bucket lists. Go bungee jumping, sky-diving, or snorkeling. Climb the nearest highest peak, or rent equipment and learn how to surf, ride dirt bikes, or skateboard.
 If you live in or near a city, take advantage of the cultural offerings. Check out famous monuments you've never visited, or haven't visited since you were a child. Visit the zoo and the local museums. See if your city has a “First Friday” and end the week by walking around looking at art. Cap it off with glass of wine or a nice dinner.

 Try a wand with several openings, so that if one opening fails on a given try, the others can still produce bubbles.
 Dip the wand in solution and gently blow some bubbles. The child will most likely chase the bubbles, and you can show them how to catch them on the wand.
 Encourage them to blow their own bubbles and try to catch them (on their hands or on the wand).
 If blowing bubbles is difficult for the child, you using the wand gives them a break to refocus and keep from getting too frustrated.

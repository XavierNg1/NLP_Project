 You can also use clear ones if you can't find any that match your hair. You will be making several topsy-turvy ponytails, right after the other, so make sure that you have enough.


This braid will work best on longer hair. It may not work very well on hair that is shorter than the upper arm.
 Try to make the ponytail as close to the base of your head as possible, but don't make it too tight.
 Start by slipping your pointer and middle fingers through your hair, right above the elastic. Split your fingers apart, creating a hole. Pull the ponytail over the elastic and down through the hole. Tug gently and smooth down your hair.
 If you have thin or fine hair, tie the elastic closer to the first one. If you have thick hair, tie it a little bit further away.
 Slip your fingers through your hair, just above the elastic, and make another hole. Pull the tail down through the hole.
 Tie your hair off with a hair tie.
 You can do this by gently tugging on strands of hair to fluff them out a little. You can also wrap colored bits of ribbon or string around the elastics. Add some colorful beads for a boho or festival look.

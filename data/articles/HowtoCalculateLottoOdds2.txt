 In most cases, there are lesser prizes available for choosing some of the numbers correctly. Choosing 3 or 4 of the winning numbers might yield you a payout of several hundred or thousand dollars. In this case, your odds are calculation as the odds of choosing a few right numbers and your odds of choosing an opposing amount of wrong numbers combined. This requires knowing the total number of possible combinations first. These can be described with the odds of choosing all of the winning numbers correctly.You'll need to have first solved for the jackpot odds as described in the method "Calculating Jackpot Odds." 

To simplify our calculations, we will just use the odds of correctly choosing the first five Powerball numbers. In the other method, this was found to be 1 in 11,238,513. 


, Your odds of winning "k" of the numbers "r" from the total pool of numbers "n" can be defined as: r!k!(r−k)!×(n−r)!(r−k)!(n−r−k)!n!r!(n−r)!{\displaystyle {\frac {{\frac {r!}{k!(r-k)!}}\times {\frac {(n-r)!}{(r-k)!(n-r-k)!}}}{\frac {n!}{r!(n-r)!}}}}. This formula seems much more complicated, but is really just three copies of the simple probability equation described in the other method. Simply input your numbers for n, r, and k.

For example, your odds of winning 3 of 5 numbers from a pool of 69 would be described by the equation 5!3!×2!×64!2!×61!69!5!×64!{\displaystyle {\frac {{\frac {5!}{3!\times 2!}}\times {\frac {64!}{2!\times 61!}}}{\frac {69!}{5!\times 64!}}}}.
 Just as with the base equation, this equation is best solved by typing the entire thing into a calculator or search engine, as some intermediate numbers involved in the calculation are too large to write down. If solved correctly, the result will be the odds that three of the five Powerball numbers are chosen correctly.

For the example, this would be 579.76. So, your odds of choosing 3 of the 5 correctly are 1 in 579.76. 


, You can edit your calculation by changing the value of k to find the odds of winning different portions of the five numbers. Your odds of winning will decrease as k increases and vice-versa.

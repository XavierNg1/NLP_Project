 Since bookshelves aren’t normally meant to sit on, this one is probably better for kids than adults, but hacking an Ikea shelf actually makes a great place to get little ones ready for school.


Try the narrow Expedit shelf (one 5-shelf column), which is handy because the square shelves allow the accompanying storage baskets and bins to work in this orientation as well. This will give you a great place to sit your preschooler down to change shoes, hats, mittens, as well as store backpacks and other items.;
, Build the shelf as described in the product’s instructions and then turn it on its side. The side on the floor will eventually become the top or seat of the bench.
 Go to your local hardware store and pick out some legs for your bench. You can get wheels (like the kind you see on shopping carts) or wooden or metal furniture feet. Whatever you feel matches with your decoration and your needs. Attach the feet at the corners of the bench as described in the instructions for the product you buy.


At least four feet are necessary. Six are recommended.
Make sure the screw does not interfere with the other pieces holding the shelf together. Be strategic!

, Turn the shelf so that it sits on its new feet. You now have a bench!

, Either make a custom cushion or buy relatively flat, square cushions to go on top of the bench. Glue strips of velcro to the top of the bench and then attach the other side of the velcro to the underside of your pillows.


It is best to put the soft, fluffy side of the velcro on the pillows, as it will make them easier to wash.
 You can add finishing touches by painting the bench a different color, if you want to. You can also buy baskets or other storage items to go in the shelves.

 Place the chestnut flat side down on a cutting board and using a sharp knife, make an incision horizontally across the chestnut. This incision is important because it will keep your chestnut from exploding in the microwave.You can also try scoring the bottom of your chestnut. To do this, take a knife and draw an X on the bottom of your chestnut.
Be careful not to cut into the meat of the chestnut.
 Place your chestnut in a bowl and gently wash it in the sink using cold water. Drain the water from the bowl before placing the bowl in the microwave. Microwave the chestnut for one minute.


Do not heat more than eight chestnuts together at once. If you heat more than eight at the same time, the heat will not reach the bottom chestnuts.Make sure to keep an eye on your chestnuts while they are in the microwave, as chestnuts tend to explode when left unattended.
To prevent your chestnuts from exploding in the microwave, make your incisions longer and deeper.
If you prefer not to microwave your chestnuts, you can also try boiling them in hot water for 30 minutes. Make sure to let them cool off before touching them again., Holding your chestnut in your dominant hand, squeeze the chestnut until the skin begins to peel away from the incision site. You should now be able to easily peel the skin off your chestnut.Peel your chestnut while itâ€™s still hot. Peeling a cold chestnut is nearly impossible.
 Do not eat your chestnut if any of the brown skin remains, as this skin is very bitter tasting. If you encounter any of the remaining skin, cut or peel it off before enjoying the rest of your nut.

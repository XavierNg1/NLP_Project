You can also engage in other types of activities with your dog, such as fetch or Frisbee., If you cannot determine why your dog isn’t eating, or if none of the suggestions above are successful, make an appointment with your veterinarian. Senior dogs should have a checkup with the veterinarian every 6 months. Call your veterinarian, explain that your older dog has a decreased appetite, and set up an appointment for a checkup as soon as possible.Ask your vet for suggestions regarding human foods that might be appropriate to help stimulate your dog's appetite.
 If you have exhausted your options, a prescribed appetite stimulant can help improve your older dog’s appetite. Before giving your dog an appetite stimulant, you should rule out all medical causes of your dog’s decreased appetite. These supplements should only be used as a last resort, and with a prescription from your vet.

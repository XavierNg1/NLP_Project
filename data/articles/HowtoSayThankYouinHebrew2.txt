 While "toda" is perfect for your everyday "thank yous," sometimes, you'll want to express that you're especially thankful for something. In this case, try "toda raba," which is roughly equivalent to "thank you very much" or "thanks a lot."


This phrase is pronounced "toh-DAH rah-BAH." "Toda" is exactly the same as above. The r in "raba" is pronounced very delicately at the back of the throat. It is very similar to the French r (as in "au revoir").Note also that the stress is on the "bah" in "raba" (just like in "toe-DAH").
 The meaning here is roughly the same as for "toda raba".However this word is used very rarely.This phrase is pronounced "ruv toe-DOT." Remember to use the soft, "French" r sound at the back of the throat, rather than a hard English r.
 While Hebrew doesn't have strict tenses and word forms for formal situations, but if you want to say thank you in a very polite, formal way, you can use gender-specific grammar. This specific phrase is used when the speaker is a man. It doesn't matter what gender the person being thanked is.


This phrase is pronounced. "ah-NEE moe-DEH leh-HHAH."The most difficult sound here is the "hah" at the end. It's not quite like the English "ha" used for laughter. The first h uses a raspy, almost r-like h sound produced in the back of the throat. It's the same sound used in traditional Jewish words like "Chanukah," "chutzpah," and so on.
 The meaning here is exactly the same as for the term above. The only difference is that it's used by females. Again, the gender of the person you're talking to isn't important.


"ah-NEE mo-DeH lach.Here, we're ending "lach" with the "chutzpah" h sound discussed above. Note also that the second word in the phrase ends with a "dah" sound, not a "deh" one.

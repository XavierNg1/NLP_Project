 If desired,lightly run your finger around the outside edge of the batter without disturbing the crumbs. It's not essential, but can make a nice "top hat" style finish.
 Bake for 15-20 minutes until well risen and golden. Only open the oven door when you are ready to serve to prevent them sinking. If you prepared them in individual ramekins, it is 8-10 minutes as a rule. Ideally the soufflé will have a tender, semi-molten centre and with practice you can refine your skills to recognise when the soufflé has reached this stage.
If it is too runny, it is a sign your oven is not efficient at retaining heat, or it may have an inaccurate thermostat.
 If the kitchen is not on the same floor as the dining room, it may be best to gather guests in the kitchen. Serve immediately with a crisp salad, bread or as is.
A good trick is to serve the soufflé dish on a heated serving plate, or at minimum a cork or silicon mat to prevent them cooling (and sinking) quickly. Scoop each portion out onto the plate using a sharp knife and a spoon, or allow guests to eat directly from their own ramekin.

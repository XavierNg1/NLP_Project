 The worst thing you can do is rip your tongue off the metal in a panic. This could give you a serious injury. Instead take a moment to think about your situation clearly. Assess whether you have someone near who can help you.


If you have someone with you, make sure they know that you are not joking and that your tongue is really stuck.;
, Basically, your tongue is stuck because your saliva is frozen solid. The reason this happens so quickly on metal, and not on other surfaces, is that metal is a great conductor.In order to unstick your tongue, you will need to warm up the metal above freezing temperature.


When you make contact with the metal, it sucks the heat out of your saliva rapidly so that the surface it is in contact with becomes the same temperature, which is called thermal equilibrium. This happens so quickly that it doesn't give your body a chance to make up the difference in heat., It will be easier to get your tongue unstuck if you have someone to help you. Once you get someone's attention, tell them to bring warm water and then have them poor it slowly over your tongue.


Don't let embarrassment get in the way of getting help. Your situation may be embarrassing but it's better to deal with a little embarrassment than an injured tongue.

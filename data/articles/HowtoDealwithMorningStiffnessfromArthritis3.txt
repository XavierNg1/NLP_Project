 Another good way to loosen up stiff joints is by doing some gentle exercises. You can even perform some exercises while you’re still in bed. For instance, roll your shoulders and ankles in small, slow circles, or reach as far as you can above your head.Once out of bed, stand with your feet together, your arms out in front of you, and your back straight. Slowly twist from side to side. This exercise alone will engage most of the joints in your body, improving blood flow.
 Physical activity is extremely important, as keeping your muscles strong will help support your joints. Further, exercise will help you sleep better, maintain or achieve a healthy weight, and improve your mood and sense of contentment.Aim to do at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five times a week.


Try yoga, tai-chi and other low-impact exercise such as swimming or elliptical cycling.
Swimming is one of the best exercise options for people who suffer from arthritis. Try an early morning swim whenever you are able, as this can help loosen up any lingering morning stiffness.
Eliminate or reduce aggravating activity, such as stair climbing, prolonged sitting and intense jogging.
 Stiff, swollen joints also need to be treated carefully. While you need to exercise to keep muscles engaged and loosen your joints, you also need to allow inflamed joints to cool down.If unaccustomed to exercising regularly, start slowly with short a short walk or casual swim.


If a type of exercise makes your joints warm or swollen, remove it from your exercise regimen. Further, don’t continue any exercise that cause site-specific pain in your joints.
Alternate exercise activities to decrease the amount of repetition and overuse of the joints.
See a physiotherapist for help establishing an exercise regimen that works for you.

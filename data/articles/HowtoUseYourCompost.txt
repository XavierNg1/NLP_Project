 As long as you maintain the pile weekly, it should be clear when it’s ready. It's ready when it is:


dark brown or black
soft
crumbly
mostly smooth (you can throw that stubborn corncob back in the pile)
earthy-smelling;
, Make a potting mixture of 1 part compost to 3 parts soil and put in pots, about an inch / 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) short of the brim. Plant your seeds in these pots just as you would any other soil.
 Plants that already have roots can handle more compost, so your potting mixture for seedlings or transplanting plants can be 1 part compost to 2 parts soil.
 If your potted plants (or flowers, herbs, vegetables) are already growing, use the compost with nothing added and sprinkle on the surface of the dirt. (If you don’t have room, you can shovel out a layer of the dirt that’s already in the pot and replace it with the compost).
 Use finished compost in a layer on top of your soil to nourish the plants underneath. Water will carry nutrients down, into the soil. This is called top-dressing. You can top-dress a garden, a tree, even a lawn (just sprinkle it in).


Compost also makes an excellent layer in any no-dig garden. In this kind of a use, especially in a raised bed, you can make the layer as thick as you like.
 As you dig garden beds, add as much compost as you like and mix it with the soil as you put it back. It's a great amendment for both sandy and clay soils.
 If you have ever had a tomato or pumpkin seed volunteer in a compost pile, you will know that some plants don't mind growing directly in compost. It can be a little strong for others, and carbon (brown stuff) that is still decomposing can rob plants of nitrogen, but if you have a few extra vegetable seeds, see if any of them would be happy directly in your finished compost pile. You can spread the compost out a bit first or move it to another spot, if you prefer.

 The jar can be as small or as large as you'd like, from a baby food jar, to a Mason jar and beyond. Just be sure you have sufficient glitter and food coloring for the jar size you're going to use.


Clean the jar before use, to remove any food residue from it.;
, The food coloring should enhance or match the glitter coloring. There should be plenty of glitter; it is suggested that you use about 1.5 tablespoons of craft glitter and 1.8 fl oz of glue glitter per Mason jar amount of water.


The craft glitter can be shaped if you prefer, such as little stars or animal shapes. Check your craft store to see what's on offer.
 Pour the boiling water into the jar.
 Go slowly, adding only enough to reach the color you desire.
 Tip in the craft glitter and the glitter glue. Stir to mix through.
 Check that it won't fall off.
 Whenever you want some sparkle in your life, or you need to calm yourself in some way, give the jar a good shake and watch the glitter swirl around for a time, creating a beautiful scene.

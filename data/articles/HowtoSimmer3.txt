 You will actually end up using less oil that way, so it’s a more heart-healthy approach. The meat will brown better, as well. In general, the ideal cuts of meat for this are tough and inexpensive. When simmered over time, they become tender.









This approach works best for red meats like beef and lamb.
If you’re working from a recipe, make sure to reference those directions frequently.
 Place the oil-coated pieces of meat into a medium-sized skillet over medium-high heat. Instead of putting all the meat in at once, brown the pieces in small batches.









Use a utensil to move the meat around frequently so that it browns evenly.
Remove each batch after browning.
Put the browned meat on a clean plate and set it to the side.
 After browning all of the meat and removing it from the skillet, pour in your cooking liquid. Depending on that you’re cooking, this will be some kind of stock or possibly wine. The heat should remain at a medium-high level until the liquid has reached a rolling boil.








You know it’s boiling when bubbles are vigorously breaking on the surface and the liquid is moving and churning in the skillet., Once you’ve reached the boiling point, lower the heat to bring the liquid down to a simmer. You’ll know it’s simmering when you see pockets of tiny, continuous bubbles breaking the surface, along with irregular wisps of steam.









The liquid should be at the simmering point before you add the meat back to the skillet.
Adding the meat to a simmering liquid will help it be as tender as possible.
 Regulate the heat as necessary and stir occasionally. You’ll probably need to adjust the heat between medium-low and low to maintain simmering.









These basic guidelines are universal to get the simmer process started for most meats.
The simmer time depends on the type of meat and what you’re making.

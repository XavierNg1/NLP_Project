 Keep stirring! You don't want the boba to stick to the bottom of the pan. And be sure to keep a 8:1 ratio of water to boba; in other words, if you have 1/4 cup of boba, use 2 cups of water. Only need 1/8 cup? Then 1 cup of water will suffice.


Some recipes call for pre-soaking your boba. This depends on the brand and type of pearls you've bought. Some will start disintegrating in the soak, while others might benefit from it. If you can, buy boba that only has one ingredient: tapioca. Those are the best quality, soak or no soak.;
, Continue cooking the boba for another 12-15 minutes, stirring every 5 or so. When the time is up, remove the pan from heat, cover, and let the boba steep for another 15 minutes.
 Boba can be enjoyed by themselves, but they're also a great addition to just about anything, though the first image that pops into mind is tea.


If you're looking to make bubbles for bubble tea, create a simple syrup for the bubbles to soak in. 1/2 cup boiling water with 1/2 cup sugar will create a sweet gel for them to sop up more flavor., Boba are best within a few hours. Place them in your simple syrup, if need be, in the fridge and let cool for about 15 minutes. That should be just the right amount of time to gain some sweetness and yet still have the right consistency. Or just eat them when they're cool out of the pan!

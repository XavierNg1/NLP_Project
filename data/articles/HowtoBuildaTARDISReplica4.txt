 For all sides but the door side, center the side panels horizontally between the posts. Glue these in place on the bottom and sides, and let dry.


If they are too tight, trim a little off one side until they fit snugly.
If too loose, add a small frame inside each side of the posts, then attach the side panel to that frame.
 Attach two window panels on each non-door side. They should fit snugly between the top of the side panels and the roof.
 Attach the long vertical strip in the center of the side panel on all 3 sides, and allow to dry.
 Starting at .05u from the bottom of the side panel, make a mark every .5u. Do this on each side of the vertical trim piece, and on the edges of the side panels. Attach a horizontal trim piece at each point, as shown.

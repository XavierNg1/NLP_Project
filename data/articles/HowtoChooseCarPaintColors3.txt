 Paint basically falls into two very large categories. Factory paint is paint that comes standard on a particular model from the manufacturer. Custom paint is also just what it sounds like ― paint tailored specifically to your taste that is not available from the manufacturer., Three common paint options are solid colors, metallic colors, and pearl colors. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, solid colors can be cheaper and easier to apply evenly, but often look more plain. Metallic colors can be a bit more exciting, as they satisfy our lust for shiny things in a society fixated on technology, but light metallic colors can be quite difficult to apply. Pearls give a depth of color that solids nor metallics can match, but do not hide inconsistencies in the color very well., Two options that are seen on custom vehicles, but rarely on factory cars are candy color and chameleon paint. This is partly because candy colors are less durable than more common paints, and chameleon paints are quite difficult to apply evenly. That being said, candy colors are known for their superior depth of color (even compared to peal), and chameleon paints stand out in any crowd since the color changes depending on the viewer’s vantage point., You not only have the choice of what color to paint your car, you also get to choose what kind of paint to use. Single stage paints can be less expensive (you need less layers and less application time) and might be a good fit for solid colors. Two stage, or basecoat-clearcoat, paint applies the pigment (color) in the initial basecoat and then a glossy clearcoat is applied on top. This provides a great look and improved durability. Basecoat-clearcoat is almost always the best choice for metallic or pearl colors.Some pearls and metallics are actually applied as three-stage paints. The basecoat is applied first, and then the pearl or metallic finish is applied, and finally the clearcoat goes on last.

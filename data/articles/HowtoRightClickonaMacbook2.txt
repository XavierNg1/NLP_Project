 Select System Preferences, and then open Keyboard & Mouse.
 Under the Trackpad Gestures section, check the box labeled “Tap trackpad using two fingers for secondary click”. This will enable you to right-click using two fingers.


Note: Depending on your OS X version, the labeling may vary. On older versions, the box is labeled “Secondary Click” and is located in the Two Fingers section.
 Press two fingers to the trackpad to right-click an object. With the secondary click enabled, doing this will open the right-click menu.

 Infants of at least 4 months who are blind or visually impaired may benefit from small doses of melatonin. Melatonin can help to set your infant’s sleep clock to a normal, regular routine. Speak to your pediatrician before you give your infant melatonin. They should specify the dosage amount for your child as well as how often you should give your child the melatonin. Never give a supplement to your child without consulting with a doctor.Your pediatrician may suggest you give your child melatonin in tablet or liquid form. Often it is given 30 minutes to an hour before the infant’s bedtime.
 Keep in mind melatonin may not work for infants who are blind or visually impaired and have a high level of anxiety or stress. Some infants find going to sleep difficult as well as other daily activities. If this is the case, your infant’s doctor may recommend anti-anxiety strategies for your infant as well as anxiety medication.Your pediatrician should outline the treatment options for infants with anxiety or stress. Medication will be just one option among many you can try to help your child deal with their anxiety.
 If your infant’s doctor recommends that you try melatonin or other medication on your child, make sure you schedule a follow up appointment to check on your infant’s progress. Have a follow up appointment in three to six months with the doctor to determine if the medication is helping and if your infant is sleeping better.


The doctor may recommend lifestyle changes for your infant in addition to medication to ensure they get the best treatment possible.
If the medication does not seem to be working, the doctor may test your blind or visually impaired infant for other issues.
 Sometimes talking to parents who have gone through the same problems can be an invaluable resource. For example, try the National Association of Parents of Children with Visual Impairments or seek out a local group in your area.

 A common reason why people get tired during the day is lack of a restful sleep the night before. Lack of quality sleep can lead to feelings of fatigue and tiredness. Most healthy adults need an average of eight hours of sleep each night.Make your bedroom as quiet and as dark as possible in order to promote the best sleep possible. Try to keep your room cool and avoid electronics (including your phone) right before bed.
At least 40% of American adults experience daytime tiredness multiple days per month due to poor sleep habits., Taking a short (power) nap may help you feel invigorated and increase your energy levels. A 20 – 30 minute nap during the day provides significant benefit for increased alertness and improved performance without leaving you feeling groggy or interfering with sleep at night.Finding a place to nap while at work may be a challenge, but consider cutting your lunch short and sleeping in your car (if your drive to work).


Make sure your boss and co-workers know of your power napping intentions and don't think you're just being lazy.
Try drinking a cup of coffee or tea right after your nap to improve the effectiveness of the nap., Heavy, strenuous exercise may cause fatigue, but regular cardiovascular exercise (such as walking briskly) for 30 – 60 minutes a day delivers more oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your heart and lungs work better.Regular cardiovascular exercise also improves mood (and libido!) and promotes better sleep, which both contribute to higher energy levels.
In addition to walking, other good exercises include swimming, cycling, and jogging on a treadmill.

 How you hold the card for an overhand toss is up to you: you can grip by card by the corner, Ferguson style as with the Frisbee toss, or you can hold the entire long side of a card between your middle and ring finger. Experiment some with different grips to see what works best for you.
 To get started, don't put your arm into it, but perform the same basic motion as the Frisbee toss, just having rotated your wrist up and down, rather than side-to-side. When you've gotten used to it, bring the card up beside your head to put more power into your tosses. It's all in the wrist.
 In one fast, smooth motion, swing your arm over shoulder and step into throw like throwing a baseball. At the end of that motion, curve your wrist out and spread your middle and ring finger slightly, releasing the card.
 Practice the motion, try to get it as smooth as possible, getting a clean release of the card. Keeping the motion as smooth as possible is the key to getting the card to spin and not cut through the air, rather than floating on it and moving everywhere.

Stand your paper bags up, side by side inside a recycling bin or on their own. Separate your plastic, aluminum, glass and paper into each bag.
 Allow your kids to draw funny faces on the paper bags, or cut out eye holes and mouth holes.
 Cut and tape the paper shopping bags to cover and protect your favorite books. Kids can decorate them with markers and crayons.
 With a little bit of tissue paper, ribbons, bows and creativity, you can place a gift inside the bag and avoid having to use wrapping paper.
 Load them up with clothing, books, magazines, videos and other items for car trips. This works especially well with paper bags that have handles.

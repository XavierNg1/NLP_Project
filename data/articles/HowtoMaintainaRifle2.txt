 Read the manualÂ of the firearm on how to do this. On bolt-action rifles, it is usually only a matter of releasing the bolt. On auto-loading rifles, the tear-down will be more complex.
 The two primary areas that will require cleaning are the barrel and the receiver and action.

The barrel is the key factor attributing to the accuracy of the rifle. Be cautious with the muzzle-end of the barrel and the beginning of the rifling (inside the barrel), as these are the two most important things to affect accuracy and can easily affect it adversely, if damaged.






Receiver and action is the bolt, chamber, and trigger assembly. The bolt holds the ammunition in the chamber and the trigger assembly initiates the process which makes the firearm go boom. This area primarily affects reliability and ease of operation, but can also reduce accuracy if poorly maintained. For most rifles, the stock and receiver are one unit, and cannot be dismantled without tools.

 Take a couple of wooden, plastic, or wicker storage bins and attach seat cushions to their tops. These storage bins are the perfect size for young children and are a great way to get toys, books, and clothing out of the way without sacrificing space. You can even attach wheels to their bottoms to make them easy for kids to move around as needed.Try different colors and patterns for the fabric tops to add character to a playroom.
 Repurpose a wooden or wicker chest to double-up as a table. Most chests are already at the perfect height for children, however, you can always add table legs to elevate the chest and make it appear more like a table. Try purchasing wooden table legs from Lowes or Home Depot, which are only $1-$3 each. You can also paint or stain these trunks to match the decor of the room.If you don’t have a chest, try searching in thrift stores or at Goodwill for a cheaper item you won’t mind the kids getting paint and other things on.
 Benches are a great way to get both storage and seating. Look for ones that have cubbies for you to put things away in. You can even get a bunch of baskets or colored storage containers to enliven the room's decor. Use these cubbies to pack away stuffed animals, clothes, or shoes.


If you have a window, try installing a bench with storage directly under it to create a reading area. You can then fill the cubbies with your child’s favorite books.

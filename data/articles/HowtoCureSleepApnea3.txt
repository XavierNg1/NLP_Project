 Constant positive air pressure (CPAP) machines are meant to keep you breathing normally throughout the night. CPAP machines send a puff of positive pressure into your airway at the end of each breath in order to keep the airway open throughout the breathing cycle. as a result, apneas due to the airway collapsing as occurs in OSA are prevented.Talk to your doctor if you are having problems using your CPAP machine. Do not stop using your CPAP machine without your doctor’s permission.
Using your CPAP machine may improve daytime sleepiness, blood pressure, glucose levels, and quality of life.If you do not use the CPAP machine regularly or use it for a while and then stop, you will lose any positive gains you made (such as improving your blood pressure).
 A dentist or orthodontist can make you a custom-made mouthpiece to keep your jaw aligned and your airways open as you sleep. While studies are very clear that CPAP is more effective than oral appliances,there is still strong evidence that oral appliances provide a significant treatment effect compared to nothing at all. Many patients find CPAP intolerable to use regularly but are able to wear oral appliances, and for these patients an oral appliance would be appropriate.


Keep in mind that mouthpieces require regular adjustments by your dentist or orthodontist or they may stop working. Keep track of adjustments and change every three months or so.
 If you do not like sleeping on your side, then try sleeping on your back in a slightly upright position. You can use a foam wedge to prop yourself up while you sleep, raise your mattress if you have an adjustable bed, or use bricks to elevate the head of your bed.Only a slight elevation of 2 – 3 inches is needed.
To use bricks to elevate the head of your bed, place them under the feet at the head of your bed. You can also use sturdy pieces of wood.

 No one expects you to enroll in the Baha'i Faith after attending one meeting although you are welcome to do so if you desire. It is unlikely that anyone will try to talk you into joining.;
, There are no Baha'i rules for modesty. Baha'is are generally conservative about clothing and if you wear something too revealing you may feel out of place. Use sense or ask to determine the dress level but most events are roughly business casual., Your hosts are eager to fit their devotion or book group into their busy schedules. By being on time you show courtesy and receive the best use of your time.
 Hospitality is a given at a Baha'i meeting, and you may be served refreshments.
 Baha'is believe in the Creative Word, which includes prayers that have been composed by the Central Figures of the Baha'i Faith. In most meetings one or several of these prayers will be read or chanted to open and close the meeting.
 They will be happy if you take the material, but not insulted if you do not.
 Your meeting may be led by a woman; tea may be served by a man. There are no ministers in the Baha'i Faith. The person hosting the meeting may be a trained tutor in a book group or a Baha'i who wishes to host a devotion or potluck dinner.
 The Baha'i Faith is new; your Baha'i friends are used to being asked questions.
 Baha'is are admonished to not engage in partisan politics, so expressing opinions about Democratic, Republican, or other parties' platforms or officials is to be avoided by Baha'is. Rather, the spiritual principles behind political concepts can be eagerly discussed.

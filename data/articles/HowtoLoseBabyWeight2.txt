 If you're tired, it can be easy to just grab whatever is handy. Instead of reaching for a bag of chips or a pint of ice cream, try something a little more healthy but equally filling. Keep your pantry and refrigerator stocked with nutritious foods so you don't reach for something that can set you back.


Fruits, carrot sticks, granola and cereal bars, nuts, wheat crackers, low-fat cheese and yogurt are all relatively easy to prepare but will leave you satisfied.
If you take some time to split bulk foods into individual portions ahead of time, that will help when you don't have the energy to prepare something.
 It may be hard to find time to nap, but this will help reset your body to give you more energy in the daytime and give your body the rest it needs to repair itself, which includes losing pregnancy weight. In addition, sleeping when you're tired helps decrease the amount of cortisol in your blood; this is the stress hormone that can make it harder for you to lose weight.
 After the first few months, you can go back to your previous workout routine. You may find at first that you've lost fitness; be patient with yourself while you work back up to your pre-baby fitness level.

 If you vacuum the floor you may want to go over it with a micro fiber dust cloth/mop to ensure youâ€™ve removed any debris.;
, Make sure you are working with a mop that has been cleaned before the last cleaning. The last thing you want is to use a dirty or soiled mop because it will transfer the odor to the newly cleaned floors.
 Or you can simply clean these floors with warm water depending on the dirt level of the floors.
 Be sure you rinse the mop after every few strokes and then return mop to the bucket to get more warm water or water and vinegar.

 Just south from the fisherman, you will find a Giant Mushroom.
 Pick it up and then head to Witch Elena's house at the Hushglen Hollow.
 She will cast a buff spell to your character to help you kill the monsters in the open world with a duration of 10 minutes.


Aside from the buff, you will also receive the title Witch's Familiar, which gives + 10 Health Points.

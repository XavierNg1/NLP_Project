 An empty cereal box will do.;
, They need to be exactly the same size and shape.
 Leave about 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) left of the larger circle, making it a thick ring. You now have your templates. You can make them any size you want, but small ones work best.
, Using any color yarn you like, start wrapping yarn around BOTH of the rings. Continue until you can't see the rings at all, then do a second layer. The more layers you add, the denser your pom pom will be.
 Using an exact blade or a pair of scissors, cut around the outside edge of your rings. When you are finished cutting and it starts to look more like a pom pom, take your set-aside length of yarn and slip it in between your templates. Tie a tight and secure knot.
 Roll the pom pom in your hands to make it even, and trim off any hanging strings, If you are making a Christmas ornament, leave the two ends of string hanging out of the pom pom and tie their ends together. Your finished pom pom is ready to roll!

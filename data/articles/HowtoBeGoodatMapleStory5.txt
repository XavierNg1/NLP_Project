 This varies by class.
 You can use cores to modify the monsters' stats for more experience. However, you can only enter five times a day.
 It is an extremely good training place to get to lvl 200. You can start there at 110, but not a lot of parties will choose you, unless you can do high damage or you're a priest who can cast Holy Symbol. The thing about LHC is that everyone trains in parties so they can get up to 250% more EXP. Add the 50% extra EXP for 375% more EXP. If you try to solo, it will take you forever because the monsters have at least a couple millions of HP, and you only get around 50 thousand EXP per monster.
 Just like LHC, you can train at the Stronghold with party members for more experience. You can join an expedition to go defeat Cygnus when you are level 170. When she dies, she drops level 140 equipment. However, you're better off killing the Chief Knights, because Cygnus is glitched and is impossible to kill.

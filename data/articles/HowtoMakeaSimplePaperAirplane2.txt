 Using A4, 8.5x11 inches paper, make a crease along the vertical line of the paper. Make sure the two edges of the paper line up exactly. Unfold the paper.









When making creases, make sure they are sharp and crisp. Use your thumb or a straight-edged tool, like a wooden depressor or a butterknife.
 The edges should meet exactly at the middle crease. The bottom of edge of the flap should be a straight line.









The flaps should make two triangles, and the tip should be in a point.
 Take the outer pointed edge and fold that corner to the center crease. Repeat on both sides.









At this stage, you will have three layers of triangularÂ  folds. The bottom corners of the top triangular layer should meet at the center crease. The edges of the paper should be be mostly in the shape of a triangle, with the bottom edge still flat.
 The pointed tip should be folded to the bottom corners of the top triangular layer that meet at the center crease. The paper now should have a flat, truncated tip where the pointed tip was previously.
 Match the edges of the paper exactly, creating a symmetrical fold along the center crease. The folds done in steps 3 and 4 should be on the inside of the paper.
 The crease should be along the top line starting from the flat nose of the plane. The folds should match on each side of the plane.









This plane flies better at a slower speed. The nose will cause it to fall if you throw it too fast.

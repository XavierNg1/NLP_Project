 You can tell if your cat has matts because the clumped fur is not painful when you touch it. If you work down to the bottom of the lump you can often see the individual hair fibers bridging between the skin and the mat., When mats do occur, they can be difficult if not impossible to comb out, resulting in the need to cut chunks of hair from your cat's coat. The cat's coat will then grow back uneven, and can take months to return to normal. Therefore, it is important to learn how to prevent matted cat hair before it happens to keep your cat looking and feeling his or her best.
 If you are unable to untangle a knot, then you may need to cut it away. Proceed with extreme caution because it is all too easy to accidentally cut the skin instead of the knot. This happens because when you lift up the knot to get it clear of the skin, the skin often "tents" upward with it. Then when you snip across the base of the knot you may cut across an elevated piece of skin.
 Try and slide a comb between the knot and the skin, and cut above the comb so that it acts as a shield protecting the skin. Pay close attention not to cut your cat's skin, especially in areas where the hair mats are close and tight.
 If you are nervous to cut out mats yourself, or if your cat is covered with mats, take it to its veterinarian. Above all, if in doubt do not cut. Take your cat to a vet clinic or a groomers where they have professional clippers that can shear away the knot with a reduced risk of cutting the skin. Your vet is probably very practiced at removing mats.
 This will help to prevent the area from matting again. If an area has been matted before, your cat will probably continue to neglect it. Make sure that you get all the way down to the undercoat and that you brush it out regularly.

 In some hospitals, medical staff is supportive of natural births and may have trained midwives or natural birthing staff to attend your birth. Research your options and visit your local hospital to ask questions and determine how well it would support a natural birth.If you are a high-risk pregnancy but would still like to attempt a natural birth, you may wish to deliver at a hospital so that medical assistance is immediately available should it become necessary.
Some hospitals have natural birth centers on site that allow a natural birth experience in an environment that feels less like a hospital, but still allows expert medical care to be in close proximity.
Talk to the nursing staff at the hospital about your options. Look for things like bath tubs for soaking during labor and birthing balls in the rooms.
 Many birth centers specifically design their facilities for natural birth support. They also have expert staff who are familiar with the natural birth process and who are committed to helping women experience natural labor.Ask the birth center about the amenities they have including options they offer for delivering your baby, such as in a bed or in water.
Request information on the qualifications of delivery staff and the centerâ€™s ability to offer care in emergency situations.
 Many women find that a home birth allows for the optimum level of comfort, relaxation, and empowerment during a natural birth. If you are a low-risk pregnancy and are able to have a birthing doula and midwife present, a home birth may be a safe and pleasant way to have a natural birth.

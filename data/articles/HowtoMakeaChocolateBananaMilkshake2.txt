 If you'd like a thinner milkshake, you can use a regular, non-frozen banana. Cutting the banana before adding it to the blender will make it easier to mix together and give you a smoother drink in the end.


Using frozen bananas is highly recommended. They will replace the ice cream in the milkshake.
 Try to get the kind used for baking. It is pure cacao and does not contain any dairy.
 If you really don't like the taste of almonds, you can use peanut butter instead, or omit it entirely.
 You can use the plain kind or the vanilla flavored kind. For a twist, you could even try coconut milk instead!For an even thicker milkshake, add in some ice cubes or frozen almond milk.
 Everything should be evenly combined, with no lumps, clumps, streaks or swirls. If your ingredients are not blending smoothly, pause the blender, and use a spatula to scrape the chunky mixture down the sides.


For extra crunch and chocolate-y flavor, add Â¼ cup (45 grams) of mini baking chocolate chips. They are typically dairy-free, but check the label to make sure.
 Pour it into a tall glass and serve it with a straw. For extra flavor, you could add a sprinkle of cinnamon or cacao powder on top.

 Go to 3 different stores and do your research online.;

Powders are the cheapest kind. Be careful with some powders.
Liquids/Gels are also cheap, but most of them have bleach.
Tablets are the most advanced since most of them include fancy additives in them.
Gel Caps are similar to tablets, but they use gel instead of powders.



Most detergents have bleach, enzymes, and phosphates.



Most detergents have phosphates and chlorine bleaches, so you may want to avoid these detergents.



If you want something that is going to give you great performance without phosphates, then choose Finish Quantum or Finish tablets/gelpacs.
If you want great performance with even more eco-friendly features, but don't want to sacrifice, then choose Method Smarty Dish.
Cascade will do good, but it's up to you.



Jet-Dry and Cascade Crystal Clear will do equally good, but if you want drier dishes, choose Jet-Dry Turbo Dry.



Cleaners such as Finish Dishwasher Cleaner or Dishwasher Magic should be used monthly, especially if you have hard water.
Glass Magic plus detergent is useful if you have hard water.
If you want, buy a second detergent for the tougher dishes.
,, Let the dishwasher do the work.

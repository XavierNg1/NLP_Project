 Use a measuring cup when dumping your rice into a bowl. Deviating from the quantity of ingredients will make your rice over or undercooked.If you want to make 2 or more cups of rice, maintain the same ratio of other ingredients.
You typically want to keep a 1:1.5 or 1:2 ratio of rice to water.;
, Use your sink to fill your bowl up with water. Don’t let it overflow or some rice may be lost.


The water should just cover the surface of the rice.
 Swirling your rice will remove the starch from it, which is the traditional method used to cook basmati rice. The water in your bowl should now look murky and cloudy.Removing the starch will prevent your rice from being overly sticky, which is popular among Japanese and Korean dishes., You can use a colander or a fine-mesh sieve to drain your rice.Make sure that all the water is drained out and you’re not letting rice fall into your sink.


If you don’t have a sieve or colander, you can tip your bowl on an angle to drain it.
Make sure you aren’t tipping the bowl too much or the rice may fall out.
 Continue to wash your rice and drain it, until the water in the bowl ceases to be murky. This indicates that you’ve washed away the rice’s starch and it can now attain a traditional basmati texture, once cooked.


This process will usually take 3 to 4 times before your rice is free of excess starch.
 Allowing the grains to soak will expand them, adding to the texture of the rice.Another added benefit to soaking is that the expanded grains are capable of soaking up more sauce from your dishes.

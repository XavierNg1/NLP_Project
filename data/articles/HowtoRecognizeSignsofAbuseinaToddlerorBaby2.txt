 An infant or toddler who has been abused by someone at home may not want to go home. They may avoid parents or other caregivers--for instance, by forcefully clinging to a teacher at preschool when it is time to go home (or vice versa).Mild separation anxiety is also common among infants and toddlers, and does not necessarily indicate abuse.
Keep in mind that just because a child seems afraid of a caregiver, it does not mean that that caregiver is abusing the child. If there is a problem, someone else at home may be the cause.
If you are taking care of children as a babysitter, daycare worker, etc., talk to the child if they seem afraid of going home. Thinking about potential abuse can make you feel very emotional, but remember you are trying to help the child one way or another.
 Children who have been abused are unlikely to understand what has happened. As a result, they may talk a lot about violent or traumatic events, or about hurting themselves or others.For example, if you are babysitting a child who constantly tells you she is afraid of being burned by a parent, that can be a real cause for concern.
 Sexual development is a long process. Certain stages begin even in young children. However, if a toddler seems to have advanced knowledge of sex, or to talk about it frequently, this can be a red flag suggesting sexual abuse.Keep in mind that some curiosity about sexual matters (like the differences between boys and girls) is natural at some stages.
If you notice something like one of your child's friends play acting sexual acts in graphic detail, however, this is unusual and should be investigated.

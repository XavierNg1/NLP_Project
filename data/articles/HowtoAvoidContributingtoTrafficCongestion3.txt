It can also make it possible to walk or bike to your destination instead of driving., If your job allows it, try working from home one or two days a week. This will prevent you from having to drive into the office, which will eliminate your commute entirely for the day., Plan your errands carefully so that you only need to make one trip to get what you need each week. This will reduce the amount of trips you need to take and the length of time you spend on the road.Make a list of things you need, and post it to a fridge or door. If you run out of something, write it down right away so that you do not forget it on your list.
Try to do your errands on the way home from work or school. This will help you avoid making a separate trip.

If a jam develops as you’re driving, they can change your route for you., Major roads typically have rush hour periods where you’re likelier to encounter traffic.

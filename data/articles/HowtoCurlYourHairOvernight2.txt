 It is usually best to split the hair down the middle, but if you have a natural part in your hair that is close to the middle, that can work too.
 To do this, you simply start by taking a section of hair from the top of your head. Split this section into three parts and start braiding like normal, except that you keep adding hair to each side as you braid. Keep going until there is no remaining hair to braid.Tie off the French braid with an elastic band.


This style will result in straighter hair on the top half and curly hair on the bottom half.
 This will result in two French braids in your hair, one on each side of your head., When you wake up, undo the braids.
 The bottom should only be curled. Set the style by spritzing it with hair spray.

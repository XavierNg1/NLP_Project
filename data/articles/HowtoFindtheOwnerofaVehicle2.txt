 If you have an opportunity to get close enough to the car, you can find the VIN on most cars by looking through the windshield at the bottom corner of the dashboard on the driverâ€™s side., There are several sources online that will perform VIN reference checks. Most of these sources, particularly the ones that offer a free search, exist to help buyers of used cars check the history of the vehicle or to ensure that the vehicle has not been stolen.However, if you are willing to pay for the service, you may find some online search engines that will provide you with personal identification information, such as name, address and phone number.
 For privacy concerns, many online search sites are unlikely to provide you with as much information as you may want. Most VIN searches, especially the ones that are free, will let you know if a car has a history of being reported stolen or reported damaged, but they will not give you personal names or contact information. For an additional fee, you may be able to receive names of prior owners, but even then you need to be wary of the results. These search engines are only as accurate as information that is fed into public databases, and the ones that claim to be able to give you personal information about prior owners are usually less reputable.In fact, in the "small print" on some search sites, the search company itself warns that you should "independently verify" any information that you recover.

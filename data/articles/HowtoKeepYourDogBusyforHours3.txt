 KONG toys are nontoxic rubber toys with a hollow center. They are available at local pet stores and come in many sizes, with variations appropriate for small puppies up through massive German Shepherds.Since they're hollow, many pet owners use the toys to occupy their dogs for hours on end by stuffing yummy snacks inside for their pet. Find one with an appropriate size and shape for your dog.


If it is too big for your dog to pick up and shake in its mouth, it is probably too big.
 Every dog has his or her favorite snack. Some like carrots and celery, others like cheese and sausages. Does your dog prefer dog snacks or human food? Find out what your doggy loves the most and use it in the KONG toy.


Some people choose to put less solid foods inside the toy and freeze them. Cottage cheese, gravy, or runny canned foods are good choices for these Kongsicles., When your dog first encounters a KONG toy, it will probably not know what to do. You may need to show your dog that you are putting a yummy snack inside the toy. Make a big show of it, waving the snack before him or her and intoning "Look what I have!" Since it's your pet's first experience with the KONG toy, choose a small snack which is easily recoverable., As your dog becomes more proficient at accessing the KONG toy's snacks, use bigger pieces of food that are more difficult to recover.


You can also try hiding the toys around the house in places that are difficult -- but not impossible -- to get to. Try placing them beneath or behind furniture where they can only be accessed with a swipe of the paw. To help your dog understand this game, hide the KONG toy in front of him or her the first time you play it.After placing the hidden snack, encourage your dog to recover it with an encouraging phrase like “Where is it?” Next time you hide it, use the same phrase to indicate to your doggy that there is a snack hidden in a KONG toy somewhere in the vicinity.

 Clear your work area and wash a ripe papaya and cucumber to remove bacteria or dirt from the skins of both. You will also need to break out your blender or borrow one from a friend. You'll need it to puree your ingredients into a fine paste. Your total supplies include:


Papaya (ripe)
Banana
Cucumber
Bowl (for brightening mixture)
Knife
Blender;
, You should cut your ingredients into the proper proportions, first. Remove the meat of the banana from its encasing skin and divide it in half. Then quarter your papaya and cucumber with a knife. Add all three ingredients to your blender.
 Banana and papaya both have skin fortifying and disinfecting properties that will cleanse your skin and leave it glowing.Use circular motions to massage a thick layer of your mixture onto your skin.
 You will want to allow time for the nutrients in your mask to infuse with and impart health benefits to your skin. Papaya has special enzymes in it that exfoliate your skin, and this can leave your skin brighter as a result!Wait for 15 minutes before using warm water to rinse your mixture from your face.
 Your warm water rinse should have flushed most of your masque from your skin, now you should rinse one more time with cold water. This will take off any residual mixture that's still on your skin and close your pores to prevent blockages.


Dry your face by patting it dry. Rubbing might cause irritation, or can rub off fibers onto your face.

 First, you must make sure that you have the Pinterest application downloaded to your mobile device. You can get this from the Google Play Store if you are using Android, or the App Store if you are on iOS.
 Sign in with your username and password.
 Once you are on the main Pinterest screen, click the Menu button on your phone and select the “Account Settings” button from the list and it will bring you to a new screen.
 On this new screen, scroll down until you see the phrases “Log in with Facebook” , “Log in with Google”, and “Log in with Twitter.” Select and check the box of the Social Network you like; a new screen will pop up.
 On the new screen, type in your username and password and click the “Authorize” button at the bottom and you are connected! It is that easy!

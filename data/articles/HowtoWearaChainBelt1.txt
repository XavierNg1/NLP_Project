 Jeans look great with almost any kind of belt, including chain belts. Try pairing your favorite jeans with a chain belt threaded through the loops or hanging around your hips to emphasize your curves.


Consider the cut of the jeans when deciding how to wear the chain belt with them. For example, if they are high rise jeans, then you would probably want to position the chain belt around your natural waist. If the jeans are low-riders, then wearing the chain belt around your hips would probably be the most flattering.
Consider other features of the jeans like embellishments before pairing it with a chain belt. For example, a pair of jeans that has crystal studs all over the back pocket might look over-accessorized with a chain belt.;
, If you have a solid color skirt or dress that could use a little something extra, then try wearing a chain belt with it. Position the chain belt near the waistline of the skirt or dress, or down around your hips.


For example, you could dress up a little black dress with a gold or silver chain belt. Or, you could dress up a white denim skirt with a gold or silver chain belt.
 Chain belts can be included in your office attire as well. Try wearing a gold or silver colored chain belt with a pair of black pants, a simple white top, and a black blazer.Avoid wearing a chain belt down around your hips at work. This may a look a bit too casual. Thread it through the belt loops on your work pants or skirt and keep it around your natural waist.
 Jumpsuits work well with a chain belt because it helps to add definition. Try wearing a chain belt with a jumpsuit around your natural waist.Be cautious about wearing too many other accessories with the chain belt and jumpsuit. The chain bet and jumpsuit will make quite a statement on their own. Keep the rest of the look simple with understated jewelry or no jewelry at all.

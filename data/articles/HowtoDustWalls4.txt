 Electrostatic dry dust cloths use static electricity to attract and trap dust. Place the cloth on the dusty wall and move it back and forth. Dispose of the cloth when you’re done cleaning the wall., A lambswool duster is one of the best options for dusting walls. Because of its elongated design, the best way to use the lambswool duster on walls is to place it in a vertical orientation in the leftmost corner of the wall, then drag it across the wall to the other corner. If necessary, use a ladder as you move across the room.After dusting the first horizontal strip of the wall, drag the lambswool duster back across the wall in the opposite direction. Dust along a path just below that of the first. Continue in this way until the wall is completely dusted.
 Attach a wall brush extension to your vacuum. Then, vacuum the entire surface of the wall. Move the vacuum’s wall brush extension from the top edge of the wall where it meets the ceiling down to the base of the wall. This will allow you to clean the wall in a complete and consistent manner.A wall brush extension is a long tube which links the suction end of your vacuum to bristled opening on the other end.
Using the wall brush extension will prevent your wall from being damaged as the vacuum tube moves across it.

 Have your supplies on hand before you start on this experiment. You will need:


Plastic bottle with a cap: A 2-liter soda bottle is ideal for this experiment. Make sure to remove the label from the plastic bottle. Then you will be able to see the clouds when they form inside the bottle. It is also best to choose a clear bottle.
Matches
Water

, Use hot water from the tap. Pour in enough water to cover the bottom of the bottle (about 2 centimeters).


Don’t use boiling water in a plastic bottle. The plastic might warp and the experiment won’t work. The water should be hot, though. Try for about 130 degrees Fahrenheit.Swirl around the water a bit to warm up the sides of the bottle.
 Blow it out after a few full seconds. Make sure an adult is doing this step.
 Tilt the bottle with one hand and insert head of the match into the top of the bottle. Let the smoke from the match fill the bottle. , where it will seem to disappear. Discard the match.
 Grip the neck of the bottle so that you do not squeeze the sides before the cap is screwed in completely. This prevents any smoke or air from escaping.
 Do this three or four times. Wait a few seconds then squeeze the bottle again, this time holding the squeeze longer before releasing.
 You should see your very own cloud there! Putting pressure on the bottle's sides forces the water particles to compress. When you let go of the sides of the bottle, the air expands, decreasing the temperature. When the air cools, the particles can stick together a little more easily, which causes them to clump into little tiny droplets around the smoke molecules. This mimics the process of clouds forming in the sky. Clouds in the sky are made up of water droplets that have clung to tiny particles of dust, smoke, ash, or salt.

 Treating a mild concussion requires both physical and mental rest. That is the single most important thing a person can do to recover as quickly as possible.Physical rest means refraining from physical activity and exertion. A person should not get involved in any sports or any vigorous activity until his symptoms are gone or his physician clears him.
Mental rest means not engaging in thinking, reading, using the computer, watching TV, texting, schoolwork, or any activities that require concentration. Do not drive or operate machinery or tools.
 In addition to resting while awake, a person with a concussion needs to get plenty of sleep at night. This is just as important as resting.Try to get at least seven to nine hours each night.
 When someone has a concussion, he should avoid mind-altering substances. Do not drink alcohol, and do not take any recreational drugs., If a person has headaches, he can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain.Avoid ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), aspirin, and Naproxen (Aleve). These pain relievers can increase internal bleeding., If someone has a bump or a bruise that hurts, use an ice pack. Donâ€™t place the ice pack directly on the person's skin. Wrap it in a towel, and hold it on the bump or bruise for 10 to 30 minutes. Repeat every two to four hours for the first 48 hours.If an ice pack is not available, a bag of frozen vegetables can be used.
Ice packs can help with the inner headache as well.
 When someone has a concussion, he should not be alone for 48 hours after the injury. Someone needs to stay with him in case he starts exhibiting serious symptoms.

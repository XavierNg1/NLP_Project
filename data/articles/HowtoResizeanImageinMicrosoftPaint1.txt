 If not, click the circle next to "Percentage" to ensure that your image's changes will be measured in percents.


Your image will start at 100 for both the vertical and horizontal values, so changing these to "75" will reduce your image to three quarters of its original size.
If you know the exact horizontal or vertical pixel count you want, it's okay to click the circle next to "Pixels" instead.
 If there is no checkmark in the box next to "Maintain aspect ratio", click the box--otherwise, any changes you make to one aspect of your image (e.g., vertical size) won't scale with the other aspects.
 As long as you're maintaining the aspect ratio, changing one value's number will change the other value as well.


Increasing these numbers will enlarge the photo, while lowering them will shrink the photo.
 Doing so will apply your changes to the image.

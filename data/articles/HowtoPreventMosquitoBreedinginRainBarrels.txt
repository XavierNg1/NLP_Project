 Instead of an open topped rain barrel, consider using a rain barrel with a downspout diverter. This creates a closed system, making mosquito breeding unlikely, if not impossible;
, This is probably the easiest way to keep mosquitoes at bay. Simply use your rain barrel regularly. Mosquitoes cannot breed in flowing water, only stagnant water. So, if you use your rain barrel regularly, there will not be an opportunity for mosquitoes to breed., Add between 1/4 teaspoon and 1/8 teaspoon per gallon of water. So, roughly 1-2 oz in a 50 gallon drum. This is drinking water safe per EPA and CDC guidelines, so it is well below anything that would bother your plants.It has the added benefit of also fighting algae., These are very simple to use. They are available at most online retailers and big box hardware stores. They cost between US$1-2 each and last 1 to 3 months each. They stay in the tank, so you only need to add another once they disappear., Though messy, this is the most organic method (other than regular use). A quarter of a cup of oil will be sufficient in the average sized rain barrel. The oil floats on top and does not allow the mosquitoes to breed, or will suffocate any larvae.

The only issue with this method is that you can only drain the barrel to the oil level, unless you want to add more oil each time it fills.

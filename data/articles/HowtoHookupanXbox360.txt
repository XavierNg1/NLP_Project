 Before bringing the Xbox in, prepare a hard, flat surface near your TV. Take the Xbox out of the box and put in on this surface. Then, remove all of the cords from the box.;
, If you have an HDTV, plug the HDMI cable in. Otherwise, use the cord with the yellow, white, and red wires. Make sure the cable you have selected is plugged into both the TV and the Xbox!

, Plug one end of the cord into the Xbox, and the other into the power brick (pictured above).
 Make sure the outlet is close enough to where you plan to keep the Xbox.
 Now that the wires are all hooked up, station your Xbox on a flat surface. If you are using a wireless controller, tap the power button (pictured above) lightly to turn the controller on.
 Your controllers could be wireless or wired. To connect a wireless controller, hold down the 'X' button in the middle of the controller until it begins flashing. Then, press the small, white button on the front of the Xbox console. The console's lights will begin to flash - this is your cue to hold the similar small, white button on top of the controller. If you have a wired controller, simply plug the controller's cable into a corresponding port on the front of the Xbox.
 Finally, you can press the silver button on the left of the Xbox to open the disc tray. Insert a game disc or movie and press the silver button again. You may now proceed to play video games or watch movies.

 If you find the card outside, wipe off any debris so that you can read the card clearly. Pull out your cell phone or walk to the nearest phone. Don’t give the card to someone else.


You shouldn’t give the card to a cashier if you find it in the store. You don’t know if they are trustworthy simply because they work at a business.Don’t call the police, either. They are typically too busy to deal with lost credit cards.
Also don’t try to track down the owner. It’s very easy for an owner to request a new credit card, so you don’t need to waste your time hunting them down.;
, There should be a toll-free number printed on the back of the credit card, which you should call.If the card has become worn or the number is obscured, then go online and find the general number for the credit card issuer.


Avoid delay. Someone else might have found the card before you and written down the number. They could be racking up charges. The sooner you report the card as lost, the sooner the credit card company can freeze the account.
 Also explain where you found the card and when.


Remember to take notes of your conversation. Write down the date and time you called and who you spoke to.
 The credit card issuer should tell you what to do with the card. Typically, they will tell you to cut up the card and throw it away.

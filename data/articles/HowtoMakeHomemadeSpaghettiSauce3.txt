 Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil to a large skillet. Allow the oil to heat over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer, which should take 3 to 5 minutes., When the oil is heated, add 1 pound (454 g) of ground beef, 1 pound (454 g) of Italian sausage with the casings removed, 1 minced onion, and 2 minced garlic cloves. Let the mixture cook until the beef and sausage are browned, which should take 4 to 5 minutes.Use a wooden spoon to break up the ground beef and sausage as you cook the mixture.
 When the meat mixture is finished cooking, drain the excess fat from the skillet. Dump the mixture into a slow cooker, and add the drained cans of diced tomatoes, cans of tomato sauce, bay leaves, dried oregano, dried basil, and kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix well so all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.If you prefer spaghetti sauce with a hint of heat, add a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes to the slow cooker.
 Place the lid on top of the slow cooker once the ingredients are combined. Turn the cooker on to low heat, and allow the sauce to cook for 8 hours., When the sauce is finished cooking, remove the lid from the slow cooker. Use a wooden spoon to stir the sauce well to ensure that the flavors are fully blended. Next, toss it with your favorite cooked pasta and top the dish with grated parmesan cheese.If you have leftover sauce, you can freeze it. Allow it to cool completely before pouring it into freezer-safe containers or plastic bags. Be sure to add the date to the containers so you know when the sauce is from and store them in the freezer for 3 to 4 months.

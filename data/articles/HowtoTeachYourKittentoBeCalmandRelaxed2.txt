 After your kitten has become comfortable in her new home, start playing with her. This will help burn off all her extra energy. Try buying multiple different toys that are good for your kitten. For example, try feather toys on the end of wands, which are fun and interactive toys for both you and your kitten.


Toys that your kitten can bat or chase around are also good options. Try toy mice and balls. You can even use a pen flashlight or cat laser pointer, which is great fun for your kitten as she tries to catch the light., Your cat needs to be played with for a certain amount of time in order for your cat to expel enough energy. Try to play with her at least twice a day for 15 minutes or longer each time. This will also help you bond with your new kitten and make her feel safe and secure.



Never let your kitten play with string, yarn, or rubber bands. These objects can be swallowed, which can lead to severe or even deadly intestinal obstructions.
Avoid letting them play with your feet or hands. This may be cute when she is young, but it can become a serious problem when she gets older. If a kitten starts to play with your hands or feet, substitute one of her toys and let her attack it instead., If you donâ€™t have time to play with your kitten every day or if she is still rambunctious after these sessions, buy a scratching or climbing post. These can be towers or posts and can be vertical or horizontal. You kitten will use the scratch posts to leave her scent behind and to play on.


Climbing towers will also give your kitten exercise as well as give her a safe place to observe everything going on in the house.
Try placing it by a window, which is an excellent spot to see outside activities.

 Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (180 C). Get out a baking sheet and lay a sheet of parchment paper on it. Open one 12-ounce (339 g) can of refrigerated crescent dinner rolls OR one 16-ounce (467 g) can of refrigerated biscuits.The parchment paper will keep the mini-Stromboli from sticking to the sheet.;
, If you're using crescents, unroll the dough on your baking sheet and set them apart. Leave them in the triangle shapes. If you're using biscuit dough, set each biscuit on the sheet. Use a rolling to gently roll each biscuit into a circle about 5-inches (12 cm) in size.You don't need to roll out the crescent dough, since it's already thin.
 Divide your meats among the dough. If you used crescents, place the fillings on the large end of the triangle. If you used biscuits, put the fillings in the center. You'll need to divide these fillings among the dough pieces:16 slices pepperoni
12 slices hard salami
12 slices cooked ham
1 cup (113 g) shredded mozzarella cheese
Black pepper to taste
1‚ÅÑ8 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons grated parmesan cheese

, If you used crescent rolls, hold the large end of the dough and roll it up, so you end with the pointed tip. The filling should be contained in the center of the dough. If you used biscuit dough, fold each circle in half and pinch the edges to make a tight seal. You can shape the mini-Stromboli into half-moons, balls, or rectangles.Set the mini-Stromboli on your prepared baking sheet with the sealed sides facing down.
 Put the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the mini-Stromboli for 11 to 13 minutes. They should turn just a little brown once they've cooked and they'll puff up slightly.You can serve the mini-Stromboli with 1 cup (225 g) of your favorite marinara sauce.

 Make sure you are prepared before you buy your reborn doll, just like a real baby. Buy real clothes or order them off the Internet, blankets, diapers, bottles, pacifiers, blankets, stroller car seat - both toddler or infant, fake formula (this can be made with fabric softener or glue and water, it's up to you) wipes, toys, etc. However, do not feel the need to buy over--priced items as a reborn isn't real and doesn't have feelings. Also plan for what doll you want. Do you want a girl or a boy? Do you care if the main body is cotton in exchange for a cheaper price? Be prepared to spend at least $90.;
, When he/she arrives, pick out a name and fill out the birth certificate if the baby comes with one and doesn't have a name yet and if it is not already filled out for you, and if they did not, you can print one off the internet. Take your baby out of the box, and remove their clothing to observe the doll and see if there are any marks or scratches on them. Then, redress them. Take some photos with your baby.
 Choose whether you want to change the baby to make sure they are clean after their long trip, or to prepare a bottle for them, or cover them up in a warm blanket to take a nice long nap. Whatever you choose, be prepared to repeat it every day. Spend some time holding the reborn and sitting with him or her, as this will make you feel more confident and comfortable with your doll.
 Having a schedule for Feeding times, expected changing times, nap times, play times.
 There's nothing wrong with having a little boast and if you want to have him or her all to yourself, that's fine too.
 Also, if you will feel confident enough to do it, It'll make you feel like a real mother to a real child. If you want, instead you can place him/her into another stroller with blankets and toys with them.

 Any space or â†µ Enter keystroke inside <pre></pre> tags should be displayed exactly as typed. You could use this to display code examples, poetry, or any other text in which exact spacing and line breaks are important.The main downside to preformatted text is the width. Unlike normal HTML, it will not resize to match the user's window size., The <br> tag ends the current line of text. You can create blank lines from multiple br tags. This is a fine approach for novice HTML students, but this kind of forced HTML styling is discouraged once you've learned CSS.
 The <p></p> tag around text defines a paragraph. Most browsers will separate paragraphs by a single blank line, but you cannot guarantee a precise style.

 Take the time to copy the complete text (by hand, not on a computer). Really focus on the words as you are writing them, as this will help you to remember them later. Seeing the words in your own handwriting will also help.
 Read through the text a number of times. You can do this out loud, if you prefer. Highlight any key words.
 Cover up the original version of the text and your handwritten version. Take out a clean sheet of paper and attempt to rewrite the text. It doesn't have to be written out word for word, or even in full sentences -- just try to remember the key words.
 Read back over the full text and compare it with the version you just wrote out. Pay special attention to any important points you missed.
 Now cover up the original text and try to rewrite it, this time using full sentences. Keep repeating this process until you have the whole text perfectly memorized.

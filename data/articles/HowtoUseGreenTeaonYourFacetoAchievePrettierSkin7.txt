 You might like to use a detox green tea but that's not essential.
 Cool slightly, enough to not burn your face. Open the teabag and press leaves onto your skin, evenly. There will be clumping. Don't rub too hard and avoid getting too close under the eyes.
 After five minutes, apply yogurt onto face with the tea leaves still on. Make a facial paste on your face and distribute evenly. Leave on another five to ten minutes.
 Your skin should feel soothed and fresh.
 Mist your face, neck and chest.

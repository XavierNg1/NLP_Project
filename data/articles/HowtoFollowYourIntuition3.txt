 It’s not just a metaphor – we really do some of our “thinking” with our guts. Your “gut brain” may let you know that you’re stressed or excited before your mind does by giving you a stomach ache, a feeling of butterflies in your stomach, or that distinctive sinking feeling that you get when you hear bad news.If your stomach hurts or feels uncomfortable when you’re dealing with or even thinking about particular situations or people, this is may be your body telling you that they are a source of stress for you. Be aware of these signals, and take a break or avoid the triggering situation or person if possible.
 You may not always be aware of it, but your sense of smell can be a powerful survival tool. Your nose can tell you if something is unsafe to eat, and can even help you evaluate another person’s emotional or physical state. Boost your sense of smell by exercising regularly and avoiding pollutants that damage your sense of smell, like cigarette smoke., When you enter an unfamiliar situation, take a quick look around. Even if you aren’t consciously aware of everything you’re seeing, your eyes may pick up on important visual cues that can contribute to intuitive responses. For example, you may subconsciously pick up on subtle changes in another person’s facial expressions or body language beyond what is immediately obvious. If something seems amiss or alarming about a person or situation, it might be because your eyes noticed something that your mind didn’t., Dangerous or uncomfortable situations may trigger a physical stress response. In addition to an upset stomach, you might feel your palms sweating and your heart racing. In some cases, our bodies pick up on the signs that something is amiss before our brains do. Listen to what your body is telling you: these stress reactions are a signal to the conscious mind to be on guard.

 Any milk will work, but whole milk is recommended for optimal taste. Cook the mixture on medium heat and bring to a boil.;
, Lower the heat from medium to low heat. Mix consistently with a whisk for about two minutes until all ingredients have been evenly blended. Do not allow the mixture to boil again.



Another idea is to substitute one third of the honey with powdered coconut sugar. To make powered coconut sugar, grind the coconut sugar in a coffee grinder until it has become a powder.
 Mix it well and let it cool. Then put it in a fridge and let it cool completely for about an hour.
 Then, add the vanilla custard mixture to the mixing bowl and mix until well-blended. Both a hand mixer or a stand mixer will work for this.
 Place the bowl inside the freezer and leave it there overnight or for seven to eight hours. In the morning, you will have your vanilla custard! To take it a step further, add any garnish you would like.

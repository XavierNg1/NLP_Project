 Call your mobile company, or go online to see if you can make international calls with your mobile phone company.
 Rates can be high, especially if you don't have a plan geared toward international calling.


For example, Virgin Mobile has an international plan that can cut the per-minute rate from Canada to Germany by as much as 90 percent, and it only costs a low monthly fee., You still need to enter the exit code for the U.S. and Canada ("011") and the country code for Germany ("49") even if you're calling on a mobile phone., You can still run up quite a bill even if you have a low per-minute rate.

 It will work in the same manner as the online test does, except for the fact that you have to write your answers down on a piece of paper.
 Speak in a loud, clear voice and follow the instructions and advice you're given.
 You will be asked questions such as "What are your goals in life?" or "What's your favorite novel?" You may also be asked questions based on the answers you gave on the information sheet you were given to fill out before the start of the audition.

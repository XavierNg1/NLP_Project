You don't have to drink liters upon liters a day, but you should drink water when you're thirsty. Try drinking some warm water, as cold water is known to close up your veins.


Cut out the caffeine. If you can't live without it, at least minimize your intake. For instance, if you usually have two cups of coffee in the morning, have one instead. Or if you buy your coffee from a cafe somewhere, try switching to decaf or taking your coffee down one size.
Cut out alcohol and other sugary drinks from your diet. Sodas and overly sweet drinks do not improve your circulation and have especially deleterious health effects.
 Draw up a nice warm bath (with or without Epsom salts, which are healing mineral salts) and relax for 20 to 30 minutes. Fill up hot water bottles, cover if necessary to avoid burns, and place on extremities to boost blood flow.
 Not only is smoking bad for your health, it also affects your circulation. Nicotine usage is among the leading causes of circulation problems.
 Over time, stress can have negative effects on the body's circulation. Find manageable, healthy ways to relieve stress, such as regular exercise, meditation techniques, and psychotherapy, among others.

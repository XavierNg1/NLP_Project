 Almost all major cities and municipalities have some type of GAP. GAPs are usually a joint effort between communities, the police, parks and recreation, community associations, local companies, and public works to combat graffiti and vandalism.
 Many GAPs (or whatever your local anti-graffiti group is called) provide assistance for graffiti removal and coverup, even if the graffiti is on private property. While services vary between GAPs, you'll want to contact them and see how they can help you.


Some graffiti abatement programs will either clean or paint over graffiti for you outright, especially if you are disabled or elderly.Some GAPs will either provide you will free cleaning and painting supplies or come and help you in your cleaning efforts.
 If you live in an area that does not have a GAP, or in which the GAP provides limited assistance, you may want to consider other avenues of assistance. Depending on the terms of various contracts, your HOA, property management, or landlord may be responsible for the cleanup.
 You will also want to report the matter to local authorities. If you are reporting a vandalism in progress, dial 911.To simply report vandalism or graffiti that has already occurred many cities and municipalities will designate a different number - often 311.Provide police with details about the location of the graffiti and when you observed it.


Reporting to the police will enable them to better target their enforcement efforts and catch the perpetrator before he or she vandalizes again.
Police are also a valuable source of information for local anti-graffiti efforts.

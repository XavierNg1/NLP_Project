 The usual temperature is 60ÂºC.
 Do not leave the damask to soak.


If using a bleaching agent, only use one with hydrogen peroxide. This will release the stain without harming the fibers.
 Do not overfill the machine; remove other items if it feels too full.
 Either line dry or use a dryer. Only dry until damp.


If line drying, make it taut, to ensure that it dries without wrinkles.
 This will ensure easier ironing and a wrinkle-free finish.


There must be a press cloth between the iron and the damask fabric. This protects the fabric from scorching.
Iron dark damask inside out, to prevent adding shininess to the front.

 People with a genuinely positive attitude are seen as more attractive and charming by others. The more you can cultivate this outlook in your own life, the more most people will like you.Don't worry if this doesn't come naturally to you â€” it is something you can learn through practice. Be conscious about smiling more. Accept compliments with gratitude and humility.
When you find yourself thinking negative thoughts about situations or people, stop and try to think of a bright side or positive characteristic that can help you feel better about it.;
, Accepting the fact that people are different from you, and that doesn't make them wrong, is part of having a positive attitude.Whether the difference is in terms of behavior, culture, or opinion, remember that these differences are not only okay, they make life more interesting.


It's easy to think "Other people would be happier if they were more like me," but remember that most people are happy being who they are, and that all people aren't made happy by the same exact things. Spending time with friends might make you happy, while spending time alone might make a different person just as happy., Make a habit of trying to put yourself in other people's shoes, even (or especially) those who you find difficult to understand or relate to.Remember that there's at least two sides to every story. Make a genuine effort to see how other people have valid perspectives, even if they conflict with your own. Having an open mind will make nasty conflicts less likely.
 We all have "pet peeves," things that really bother us when other people do them. Think what yours are. Recognize that not everyone feels the same about these things.Further, make plans to deal with these things when they come up. Does it drive you crazy when people whistle or drum their fingers? Having a practiced, polite response to these behaviors that lets others know you find it frustrating without being critical or combative can help you get along better with others.
For example, you could say: "Excuse me, would it be okay if I asked you to stop whistling? No offense, but it really drives me crazy after a while!"

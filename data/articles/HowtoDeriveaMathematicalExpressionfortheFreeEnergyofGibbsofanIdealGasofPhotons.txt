 The free energy of Gibbs is a thermodynamic function that is formulated under the on control of the temperature and pressure. his basic thermodynamic function has importance especially in predicting spontaneous direction of chemical reactions. Its absolute value is indicative about the direction of the chemical reaction.


For example, a positive value of this function usually signifies a non-spontaneous direction of the chemical reaction.
Also, a negative value of this thermodynamic function is usually indicative of a spontaneous process of the thermodynamic reaction. A zero value of the free energy of Gibbs usually signifies an equilibrium state of the chemical reaction. Therefore, this thermodynamic function is predominantly used to predict the direction of spontaneity of thermodynamic processes.;
, The free energy of Gibbs has the following general mathematical structure: G=H-TS. It can be shown that at constant temperature the free energy of Gibbs has the following differential form:


dG=VdP






This expression is correct for an ideal gas at constant temperature.
,,,,,,, This simple mathematical expression relates the free energy of Gibbs of an ideal gas of photons to the force F1 in terms of the work that is done by this force along the distance L.


If the force F1 sign is positive then this means that the G is negative and the process that involves the photons is spontaneous.
If the sign of the force F1 is negative then this means that the value of G is positive and the process that involves the photons is then non-spontaneous.

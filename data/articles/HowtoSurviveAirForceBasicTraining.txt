 Despite how brash this step may sound, it is actually very practical. Unless they ask you something, be quiet as a mouse.;
, If they say "This is how you make a bed", then that's the way that you make it. Don't be tempted to take shortcuts—they will be noticed, and you will probably be forced to start over, being told to follow the instructions word-for-word.
 You may not realize it, but a lot of time is spent in the class room. It is all important and will be crucial in your Air Force career.
 You will be sore and you will more than likely feel like giving up.
 If you can't do the requirements when the time comes, you will be held in a Flight that does Physical Training 3 times a day and eats on a diet and not many make it out of the 319th. Be able to do 40-50 push ups in one go, 50-60 sit-ups, and to run a mile in about 8 minutes depending on your age and gender (8 minutes is more common for a male).
 Don't be surprised when your spouse/significant other tells you.
 Even though the Instructors may tell you that you are doing a horrible job, remember that you have taken on a challenge that would leave most 6'4" 250 lb tough guys peeing in their pants.
 Look at it as a game when it is a game. Look at it as real when it's real. If you are practicing a scenario that involves saving a life, then put yourself on a line—even if it is just a practice scenario. Act as though the person's life did depend on it—one day, it just might. On the other hand, if it is something that is off the wall, basically a "do cause I say so", then look at it as a game. It more than likely is.
 You may think going back home is the answer, but 99% of the time you will appreciate it if you stick it out, and you will regret giving up. You will know the feeling when you are holding that Airman's Coin and leaving Lackland.

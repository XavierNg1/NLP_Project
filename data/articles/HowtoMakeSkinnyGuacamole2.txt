 If you're using fresh or frozen peas, put 1 cup (150 g) of peas into boiling hot water. Boil them for 2 minutes before you drain them. Rinse them with cold water right away to keep them bright green and stop them from cooking. Place the peas in a mixing bowl or small food processor.If you'd like, you can use canned peas. Just drain the water and rinse them with fresh water. You don't need to blanch the canned peas.
 Wash 1 large ripe avocado and carefully slice it in half lengthwise. Pop out the pit and slice the avocado flesh, so you make cubes. Use a large spoon to gently scoop the cubes out of the avocado. Place the cubes in a serving bowl or the food processor., If you'd like smooth guacamole, put the lid on the food processor and blend them until they're pureed. If you'd like chunky guacamole, use a fork or potato masher to mash them until they're just combined., If you used the food processor, put the mashed avocado and pea mixture in the serving bowl. Add 1/2 cup (130 g) of mild salsa and 3 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice to the mixture. Mince 1 garlic clove and slice 1 green onion. Add these to the bowl along with:1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon salt or to taste
1/4 teaspoon black pepper or to taste
1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro (optional)

, Use a large spoon to stir the guacamole ingredients together until the seasonings are incorporated. Serve the guacamole immediately with baked tortilla chips, fresh vegetables, or pita bread.You can store the guacamole in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one day.

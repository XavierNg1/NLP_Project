 Cosmos can reseed in a garden, surprising the grower with new plants in the spring. There is usually no need to harvest the seeds yourself, unless you want to place them in a particular spot.


Note that the next generation may or may not be the exact clones of the original plants you planted.
Chocolate cosmos will not produce fertile seeds.
 After the flower dies, the center of the bloom (disk) will turn into what looks sort of like a porcupine with brown to black seeds. Wait until these seeds shrivel and turn brown.
 Once the seeds are ready, you can easily pull them off the flower. Grasp the base of the flower head with a light touch and pull outward to brush the seeds into a sandwich bag or other container., Leave the seeds in a sunny area protected from wind. After about four to seven days, they should feel mostly dry and a little sticky.
 If there are frosts in your area, seal them in a plastic bag and keep them in a cool, dry place. Plant next spring.


Label the bag with the year you collected the seeds and the variety of Cosmos.
Sometimes you'll see little bugs in the cosmos seeds you've collected and dried. Don't panic –– they are not a major problem, and typically die off after a month or so.

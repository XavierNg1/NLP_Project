 If dabbing at the stain with hairspray and rubbing alcohol didnâ€™t work, you may need to soak your silk dress in a solution of dishwashing soap and water to get the rest of the stain out. In a large basin or container, mix 3 parts dishwashing solution with one part water.Use a clear dishwashing soap as opposed to a colored soap.
 Place the ink-stained dress in the basin of dish detergent solution, making sure that the stained section is fully submerged in the liquid. Soak the dress for 15 minutes to target the stain., After you soak the dress for 15 minutes, take the dress out of the dishwashing solution and run hot water over it until the solution seems to be washed out and the water is no longer sudsy. Then launder the silk dress as usual.

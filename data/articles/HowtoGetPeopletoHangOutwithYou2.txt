 Sometimes, changing up your normal routine has the potential to open up your surroundings and the people that youâ€™re around. Trying new activities has the potential to turn into new hobbies. New hobbies bring new opportunities to make new friends.


When you spend time doing something you love, you're more likely to meet people with similar interests who want to hang out. For example, if you discover you like trivia, join a trivia team; you'll quickly get to know your teammates, and you'll have a built-in hangout session every week.Consider joining a club or sports team that meets weekly. This regular social time will put you more in the mood to make new friends.
 Dating sites paved the way for meeting people online, but you can use them even if friendship is what you seek. Choose a dating site conducive to friendly matchmaking and create a profile to share your interests. Be as open to meeting others as you'd like them to be when they come across your profile.


For a less personal experience, try a site that hosts meetups among people with common interests. You can meet up with people to play a sport, take a hike, discuss politics, and so on.
Try putting your Facebook friendships to the test by organizing a meetup among people you already know. See if people want to have a picnic, play a game of pickup kickball, or meet up in a smaller group for coffee.
 Embrace hobbies and interests that are designed for socialization such as joining the local sports league or hanging out at the gym, bars, clubs, and so on. Shy away from solitary hobbies such as reading or going for a walk. Being around more people increases the likelihood of meeting new people who share similar interests.

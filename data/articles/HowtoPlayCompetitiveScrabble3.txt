 While recreational Scrabble players often use whatever hard-copy or online dictionary happens to be handy as a reference, players who compete in Scrabble tournaments use the Official Tournament and Club Word List. If you donâ€™t already have a copy, get one and start using it when you play.


The "Official Tournament and Club Word List", published by Merriam-Webster, is the reference dictionary used in tournaments sanctioned by the North American Scrabble Players Association., Because the OTCWL and similar reference dictionaries contain too many words to memorize directly, many competitive Scrabble players break words down into smaller lists by commonalities, such as words of 2 letters, words of 3 letters, words with 4 or more vowels, and words that use Q without a U after it.There are 105 2 letter words in Scrabble including be, ma, jo, za, and it., Rack management is the skill of knowing what words you can make out of the tiles presently on your rack, as well as knowing which tiles to hold onto for later, and when to exchange tiles for best advantage. This skill begins with an ability to recognize combinations of letters that appear in most words and to anagram the letters on your rack into meaningful words.A Scrabble player skilled at managing his or her rack can play all 7 tiles not just once during a game, but as many as 3 or 4 times.
 Novice Scrabble players place tiles on the board wherever they see places to put them. Competitive Scrabble players know how to place words to use the premium squares (double- and triple-letter, double- and triple-word) to their best advantage and also how to lay down words to block their opponent's access to those squares. They can also place tiles so as to make not just one word off their opponent's word, but several.

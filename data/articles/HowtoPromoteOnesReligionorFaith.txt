 The way you act should reflect the things you believe in your heart. "Actions speak louder than words" so they say.... When people notice a difference in your actions than everyone else's they will be drawn to ask how and why you are different. This is the perfect time to explain that you are different because you are a Christian. You believe in living differently than other people because of your religion.;
, It's usually considered rude and condescending to impose our own ideas or give advise to people, especially when they have not asked for it. This is one of the most common errors in trying to share faith, we share too early or inappropriately. When we nurture relationships and they turn into friendships, when we are willing to be still and listen, then we get to the part where we can be ready for those opportunities to have conversations about faith.
 There is a saying, "If you can't be a good example, then you'll be a horrible warning." People most often want to emulate those they see are living, happy well-balanced lives. While none of us can be perfect, if we are truly "walking the walk" of our own spirituality, those gifts of kindness, generosity, humility and honesty will be truly evident in our lives. People hunger for integrity and kindness, and when they see it, they will want to know how you got it.
 Everyone comes from a different background, and sometimes dogma or religion was a negative rather than a positive influence in their lives. Others may be perfectly content with their value system and see no need for yours, and yet still others may not be willing to listen to any point of view, except their own. Keep in mind, your goal should be to be available, helpful and non-judgmental when others seek YOU out for answers in their spiritual journey.

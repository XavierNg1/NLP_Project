 Newer Nook models have the ability to download apps directly to the device. Overdrive, the company most libraries use for digital lending, has a Nook-compatible app you can download to simplify use., To borrow from your library, you will need your library card and the name of your library. Find your specific library in the search tab in the Overdrive app and select it to get a list of the available titles.
 Once you’ve selected the book you wish to borrow, you will hit “download,” and check it out using your library card. It will be stored in your Overdrive app under “Bookshelf.” You will read your book through the app., Through Overdrive, the library book will have a lending period automatically placed on it. Once this lending period has expired, the book will be removed from your Overdrive Bookshelf by default, and will no longer be available to read until it has been checked out again.

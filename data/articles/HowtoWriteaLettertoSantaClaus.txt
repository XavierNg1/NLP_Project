, Start by writing your full address in the top right hand corner of the page. Do this carefully so Santa will know where to find you and so he can write a letter back. On the second line, write the date. Skip one line.
 Write: "Dear Santa" and then indent your first paragraph. Then, start writing your letter. It is always a good idea to say a little about yourself, such as your name, your age, etc. Tell Santa you have been really good this year. Give an example of how good you were, such as "I helped my little brother decorate the Christmas tree."

, Thank Santa for the gifts you got last year unless you sent him a thank you letter at the time. It is nice for Santa to feel appreciated.
 Keep your list short and really think about what you would like. If you want Santa to bring things for your family, then make sure you mention it.
 Finish your letter by sending your love to the reindeer (especially Rudolph), but do not ignore the others.
 Address your letter to: Santa Claus, The North Pole.
 Remember to say love or kisses from (your name).
 If you have any extra room, draw a picture at the bottom of your letter. Draw a Christmas tree, reindeer, or even Santa himself.
 With a parent or guardian's help, mail the letter

 Label the first row “seconds” and the second row “minutes.”
, A unit rate is a rate with a denominator of 1.In this instance, you are comparing 1 minute to a number of seconds. 1 minute = 60 seconds. So, your unit rate is 60seconds1minute{\displaystyle {\frac {60\;{\text{seconds}}}{1\;{\text{minute}}}}}. To show this in the chart, write "60" in the top row of the first column, and write "1" in the bottom row of the first column.
 This value should go in the first row of the second column.

For example, if you are converting 9,000 seconds to hours, write “9,000” in the first row, second column of your table.
 In this instance, you are trying to find out how much the number of seconds you are converting changed from the number of seconds in the unit rate. To find the factor of change, divide the number of seconds you are converting by 60, the number of seconds in the unit rate. Note this factor, but do not write it in your chart.

For example, if you are converting 9,000 seconds, you would calculate 9,00060=150{\displaystyle {\frac {9,000}{60}}=150}. So, the factor of change is 150.
 Since the number of minutes is only 1, you really only need to write down the result of the number of seconds divided by 60. This will show you the conversion of seconds to minutes.For example, 1×150=150{\displaystyle 1\times 150=150}. So, 9,000 seconds is equal to 150 minutes.
 To do this, set up another conversion table, using minutes and hours instead of hours and minutes. The unit rate is 60 minutes per 1 hour. Use the number of minutes you are converting, instead of the number of seconds, in this table.

For example, if you converted 9,000 seconds to 150 minutes, you are now converting 150 minutes to a number of hours. In your table, you need to find the factor of change from 60 minutes to 150 minutes. Since 15060=2.5{\displaystyle {\frac {150}{60}}=2.5}, your factor of change is 2.5. Multiply this by 1 hour. 1×2.5=2.5{\displaystyle 1\times 2.5=2.5}. So, 9,000seconds=150minutes=2.5hours{\displaystyle 9,000\;{\text{seconds}}=150\;{\text{minutes}}=2.5\;{\text{hours}}}.

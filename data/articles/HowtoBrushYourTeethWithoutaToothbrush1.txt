, Before there were toothbrushes, most people brushed their teeth with twigs. In many parts of the world, they still do, using twigs from oak, arak, or neem trees.Research shows that twigs from the arak tree contain natural fluoride and antimicrobial agents, and brushing with them is as or more effective as brushing with a toothbrush and toothpaste.Pick a young, flexible branch about 6 to 8 inches long (15 to 20 cm). You want one without real bark, only a thin skin.Peel the skin off and chew on one end of the stick until the fibers separate, turning the end into a little brush. Use it to brush your teeth.You can also use a toothpick to clean between teeth, but use caution so as not to hurt your gums and make them bleed.

 Acid reflux may be a symptom of a condition called esophagitis, in which the esophagus becomes inflamed, causing esophageal narrowing, damaging the tissue, and increasing the chances of choking on your food. If left untreated, esophagitis can lead to severe tissue damage and esophageal cancer. Common symptoms are heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and chest pain that occurs while eating.A cold, flu, or other viral infection should be treated immediately if you have acid reflux, as it can lead to increased inflammation in the food pipe. See your doctor if symptoms:Last longer than a few days or don't improve with over-the-counter antacids
Are severe enough to make eating difficult
Are accompanied by flu signs and symptoms, such as headache, fever, and muscle aches
Are accompanied by shortness of breath or chest pain that occurs shortly after eating
Get emergency care if you experience pain in your chest that lasts more than a few minutes, suspect you have food lodged in your esophagus, have a history of heart disease, or have impaired immune function.;
, Heartburn may also be a symptom of gastritis. Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining often caused by helicobacter pylori bacteria, which may also cause stomach ulcers. An autoimmune disorder, a backup of bile into the stomach, or long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can also cause gastritis.Common symptoms of gastritis include:Indigestion
Heartburn
Abdominal pain
Hiccups
Loss of appetite
Nausea
Vomiting, possibly of material that looks like ground coffee (blood)
Dark stools

, Gastroparesis is a condition in which the movement of the muscles in your stomach does not function normally, preventing your stomach from emptying properly. This can cause acid reflux and vomiting by backing up stomach acids in the esophagus.People are more likely to develop this condition if they have diabetes or recently had a surgery. Symptoms of gastroparesis include:Vomiting
Nausea
A feeling of fullness after eating just a few bites
Abdominal bloating
Abdominal pain
Changes in blood sugar levels
Lack of appetite
Weight loss and malnutrition

, Heartburn, angina, and heart attack may feel very much alike. Both heartburn and a developing heart attack can cause symptoms that subside after a while. Typical heart attack signs and symptoms for which you should go to the emergency room immediately are:Pressure, tightness, pain, or a squeezing or aching sensation in your chest or arms that may spread to your neck, jaw or back
Nausea, indigestion, heartburn, or abdominal pain
Shortness of breath
Cold sweat
Fatigue
Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness

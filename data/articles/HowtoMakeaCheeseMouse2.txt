 For example, a small mozzarella or bocconcini cheese shape.
 Insert these into the head end of the cheese, to form ears.
 Use sultanas or raisins for eyes. Alternatively, cut small slivers of olives to serve as eyes. (An easy way to cut the olive is to pierce it with the end of a straw, to make a perfect circle.)

, Use a sultana or a peppercorn for a nose.
 For example, a piece of chive stem or a length of pretzel. If you have the ability to make long curls from vegetables, use carrot or celery curls for the tail.
 This part is optional but if you'd like a few whiskers, cut some very fine slivers of celery and place them where whiskers would appear.
 They look more effective as a group. They're now ready to serve.

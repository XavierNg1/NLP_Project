 Wear clothes that are in style, you like, and fit your body well. Choose colors that complement your hair, eyes and skin tone. Keep some neutral essentials around such as white t-shirts, classic blue and black jeans, and a watch.;
, You don't have to have the look of a hardcore bodybuilder, but you do need to be in shape if you want to be hot. Mix cardio with strength training to sculpt a body that the ladies will love.
 Get a stylish haircut, trim your nails and either shave or trim your facial hair. If you have ear or nose hair, it's time to do some man-scaping. Avoid being overly hairy - a hairy back looks good on no one.
 You should definitely avoid dousing yourself in cologne, but you should shower, wear a quality deodorant and freshen up your breath. No matter how fit you are or how fashionable, if you smell sweaty or have dog breath, you're going to be lonely.

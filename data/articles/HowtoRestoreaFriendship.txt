 Smiling helps the other person to know you are ok with them.;
, If you see your friend while you are out, say "Good Morning" "How are you?" or whatever that shows you care about your friend. Your friend will feel good to know you cared enough to wish them a good morning and to ask them how they were doing. Then it gives them the chance to say what is on their mind.
 If your friend seems down, give them a hug if possible. This will just make their day and make the rest of their day good.
 Tell them you are always there for them, they can talk to you "anytime" they want of anything. These will help them.
 If you work with them, try to help them out with something. Even the littlest thing you help them with will make a huge difference to them.
 Find topics. Just anything. Stop waiting for them and eventually go complete silence.
 This highly increases the length of your talks.
 It's the only way to show that you are paying attention to them.
 Say something to them that will make them laugh. Your friend needs to feel good with you in order to have a good friendship again.
 Offer an olive branch to start up activities. For example, do what the other person is interested in doing. Another thing would be to make a bargain. To make a bargain, state what you want, find what she wants, and meet halfway. Lastly, you can make a good friend feel as the title implies this: a good friend.

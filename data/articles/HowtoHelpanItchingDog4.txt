 To prevent itching and irritation, never substitute regular shampoo for dog shampoo when bathing your dog. Shampoo for humans is much harsher than dog shampoo and will disrupt the delicate PH balance of your dog's skin. It can also wash away the essential oils from your dog's coat, which will make your dog vulnerable to bacteria and parasites., Regular brushing can remove dead hair from your dog's coat, as well as dander from its skin, both of which can cause itching. Brushing also distributes essential oils through your dog's coat, which prevents bacterial buildup, and stimulates your dog's skin. Brush your dog from top to bottom at least once a week, but preferably every few days, to keep it healthy., Bring your dog to the vet regularly to screen for or prevent itch-causing ailments. Conditions like ringworm and yeast infections can cause itching, and should be diagnosed and treated by a veterinarian. Vets can also rule out medical problems and suggest environmental changes to help your pet, or prescribe supplements (e.g. mega 3 and omega 6) to treat your dog's symptoms.

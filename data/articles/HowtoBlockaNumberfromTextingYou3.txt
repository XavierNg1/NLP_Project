 If after tapping Google Play Store you find yourself in the music section, be sure to exit it. To do so, look to the upper left corner of your Google Play screen, and tap on the three horizontal lines.
 Then, look to the upper right corner and tap on the search icon. Enter Calls Blacklist in the space provided, then tap the search icon next to the search bar. Various apps matching your search criteria will appear.
 Make sure to select this specific app, as other ones with similar names might come up. Tap on the app, and wait for it to finish downloading.
 Once the app is installed, tap on the green Open button.
 After the app launches, you'll see a white circled Plus icon in a blue bar. Tap on it. That's the way to add numbers and contacts you wish to block.


You'll have the option of selecting a number From Contacts, Log, Manually, and From Messages Log.
From Contacts will take you to your entire contacts list.
Log will take you to the numbers with which you've interacted within a set timeframe (each phone is different about how long it'll retain numbers that weren't stored).
From Messages Log will take you to all of the messages you have on your phone. You can select a contact from a message.
 For example, if you'd like to block a number that is registered in your phone as a contact, simply tap on From Contacts. Then, mark off the contact from the provided list.
 Look to the bottom right side of your screen. Then, tap Add. You will no longer receive messages from this contact.


Repeat the above two steps for any Add category (Log, Manually, From Messages Log).
You can remove a number from the blocked list anytime by tapping on the number, and then tapping Delete.

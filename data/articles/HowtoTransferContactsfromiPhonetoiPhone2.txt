 You can transfer your contacts to your new iPhone from your old one using iTunes or iCloud. iTunes is the recommended route, as it is a much faster process than transferring using an iCloud backup.
 It should appear in the top row of buttons in the iTunes window.
 This will open the Summary page.
 This will create a backup of your old iPhone that will be saved to your computer. Creating the backup may take a few minutes to complete.
 After the backup has been created, you can start setting up your new iPhone. Turn it on and follow the Setup Assistant prompts to setup your new device. Make sure to log in with the same Apple ID that you used on your old iPhone.
 You'll be prompted to connect your new iPhone to your computer so that it can load the backup file from iTunes.
 This may take several minutes as the data is copied from your computer to your new iPhone. Once the backup restore is complete, your new iPhone will have all of the contacts from your old one.

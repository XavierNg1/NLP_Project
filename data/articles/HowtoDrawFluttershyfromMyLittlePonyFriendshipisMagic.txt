 Draw a circle for the head, thighs, and upper muzzle. Add curved lines for her hooves. Sketch the boundaries where her wings will be. Draw ovals for her eyes.

Draw the shape of her upper mane along with her widow's peak, and have swirls to represent her lower mane and tail. Think of this step as guidelines for the actual line art.
;
, The belly, in this pose, overlaps the thighs. Front hooves widen as they go down and have rounded edges. Draw in the swirls of her mane. She has a smile coming down that meets with her chin and another line to the right of it to show her open mouth. The right side of her thigh connects to the lower part of her hind hooves. The left side of her hind legs makes a gentle curve. Draw sloping lines that border Fluttershy's eyes (an eyelash is made automatically) then add two more lashes to each eye. Pony ears are somewhat triangle shaped. As for her wing flaps, draw three elongated ovals at top (longest at the topmost flap) and a plumper oval at the bottom.
 Add the bottom lashes, nostril, inner mane/tail lines, and a curve marking the interior of the ear. Her iris is a necessary detail (oval for iris, oval for pupil, circle or oval for highlights). Her front wing flaps are two elongated ovals and a plump oval at the bottom. They are shorter than the four flaps behind. Put three little dashes on her flank for the body of the butterflies on her cutie mark.
 Add wings and antennae to her cutie mark butterflies and eyebrows if you wish. Shade in and color mane, tail, and body however you want. (it doesn't have to be in black in white like in the picture, of course) This step is mostly improving whatever you deem necessary.

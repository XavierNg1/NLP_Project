,, Once you get over the news article that will decrease the amount of students by a little bit, its worth it. Dismissing teachers comes at a cost, but even if your in debt you can still pay for it. You actually only need one teacher.
 It earns extra money.
 Even if they have a high facility upkeep, they pay for themselves, and most of the time you get more than the facility upkeep. Its worth it.
 After a while you can have more money then you started. Someone once was over $90,000 in debt on pocket academy, and now has over $100,000 on the game. Good luck!

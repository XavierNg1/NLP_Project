 When you work remotely you can save precious time each day when your daily commute is eliminated. Instead of spending an hour commuting to and from a brick and mortar office, you can spend that time on more important things like planning healthy meals, exercising, or spending time with friends and family., Working from home can mean a more flexible schedule and fewer hours spent commuting back and forth from the office. This translates into more time you can spend with your children during the workweek, allowing greater opportunities for transporting children to and from school, participating in extracurricular activities with them, and devoting more time to helping with homework. Parents of small children can even spend the work day with their kids., Remote workers don’t need to spend their hard earned cash on gasoline, bus fare, or train tickets. You also won’t need to invest a ton of money into your work wardrobe, and you’ll save money on eating out for lunch as well. These savings can be significant, especially when you consider the miles you won’t be putting on your odometer driving to and from an office space away from your home., A 2011 study found that people working from home reported around twenty-five percent less stress than those working away from home. They were also more likely to sustain a positive work life balance and managed to eat healthier than their counterparts who worked at corporate offices., Working from the comfort of your living room means you might be able to avoid some of the politics and drama at the workplace, because you will have fewer face-to-face interactions with your co-workers. Employees who work remotely may be less likely to engage in gossip and idle chat because they’re not hanging out in the break room, around the water cooler, or having lunch together.

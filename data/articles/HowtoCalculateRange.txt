 To find the range of a set, you'll need to list all of the elements of the set so that you can identify the highest and lowest numbers. Write down all of the elements. The numbers in this set are: 14, 19, 20, 24, 25, and 28.


It can be easier to identify the highest and lowest number in the set if you list the numbers in ascending order. In this example, the set would be rearranged like this: 14, 19, 20, 24, 24, 25, 28.
Listing the elements of the set in order can also help you make other calculations, such as finding the mode, mean, or median of the set.;
, In this case, the lowest number in the set is 14 and the highest number is 28.
 Now that you've identified the smallest and largest numbers in the set, all you have to do is subtract them from each other. Subtract 14 from 28 (28 - 14) to get 14, the range of the set.
 Once you've found the range, label it clearly. This will help you avoid confusing it with any other statistical calculations that you may need to make for the set, such as finding the median, mode, or mean.

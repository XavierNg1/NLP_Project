 The best tights to turn into leggings will be those that have a high denier, or strength of fabric. Tights made from cotton, wool, bamboo or opaque synthetics may work best. Transparent or lightweight denier won't usually turn into good leggings and risk more tears and runs. And, as noted above, if the toes or heels have gone in the tights, all the better, as you're rescuing them!;
, It's probably best to begin with a long length, which allows you to change to a shorter length at a later time for a different look.
 Add an extra inch (2.5cm) for a hem before cutting. Cut as neatly and straight as possible, using sharp sewing scissors.
, Use an even, small stitch in the same color as the tights or in invisible thread.
 for decoration. Doing this will make the tights harder to wash though and will weaken the fabric by making sewing holes, so bear this in mind before deciding.
 They'll look great with a skirt or long top.

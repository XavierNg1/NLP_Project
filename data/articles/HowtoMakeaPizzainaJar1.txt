 If you're doing homemade, combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast, and salt into a mixer bowl and combine the ingredients.


As the mixer is running, add water and 2 tablespoons of oil and beat until the dough forms a ball. If the dough is sticky, add more bread flour. If the dough is too dry, add small amounts additional water to moisten.
Scrape the dough together onto a lightly floured surface and begin to knead into a smooth ball for 10 minutes. Continue adding flour when the ball becomes too sticky
A good way to test if the dough has been kneaded enough is to raise the ball of dough a foot above the surface and drop it, if the ball stays in tact then you are good to go, if not then keep kneading.
Glaze a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons of olive oil, then add the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit in a warm area for about an hour to allow it to double in size.
Take the dough, and once again place it on a lightly floured surface and divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Cover each piece with plastic wrap and allow it to sit for 10 minutes.;

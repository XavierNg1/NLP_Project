 Based on the number of pages youâ€™ll need, divide out the book's pages and bind with paper or binder clips.


Make sure you clump an even number of pages together throughout the book. To ensure evenness, clip on both the bottom and the top of the pages (and on the side if necessary).
 If the pages won't smooth, you can try lightly misting them with water and close book for several hours if pages.
 Place a drop or two of glue along the perimeter of each page and hold together until each bound page division is held together.


Press down carefully with your hand to ensure the pages are bound together and smooth over the front and back page.

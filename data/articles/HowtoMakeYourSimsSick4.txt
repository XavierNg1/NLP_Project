 She will get morning sickness and run to the restroom a few times to vomit. This will work in the Sims 2, 3, and 4.
 Certain traits can make it easier for your Sim to get sick while others can make it much harder. Here are some suggestions to get you started; keep in mind, however, that not all of these traits may be present in all versions of the Sims:Avoid the glutton trait. It will give your Sim a stronger stomach and make it more difficult for him or her to get sick from eating spoiled food.
Avoid the neat trait. A neat Sim will want to clean all the time, and it is harder to get sick in a clean environment.
Consider the slob trait. You will find that the house becomes dirtier faster with them around. A Sim is more likely to get sick in a dirty house.
 Your Sim will find this disgusting and get nauseous.
 Certain mods can change the Sims' moodlet or health bars, allowing you to make them sick on command.
 If your Sim is in the science career, he or she can create a virus using the BioTech station. You can then get your Sim, or other Sims, sick with this virus. This works for the Sims 2., After three to four seconds, your Sims should vomit. If your Sims only show nausea, just give your device another two to three seconds' shake. They will definitely be sick.


This works for cell phones and tablets.

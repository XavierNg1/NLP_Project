 This is the best way to relieve your cramp. If the cramp is in your calf, stand on the cramping leg with your knee bent. If you are unable to stand, sit down with your leg straight and pull the top of your foot towards your head. Applying pressure can be a simple way to bring your cramped muscle into a relaxed position. This will also stretch your hamstring if it is cramping.If your quadricep (front of your thigh) is cramping, support yourself with a chair and pull the cramping leg towards your buttocks.Hold each stretch for 30 seconds and then release. Repeat as needed. Stretching should never be painful.In addition to stretching, it may be helpful to walk around or jiggle your leg. You can also apply pressure to the cramping muscle. Use your hands to make circular motions in the cramping muscle., If your muscle feels tense or tight, applying heat can provide some relief. Put a heating pad or warm towel on the cramping muscle. You can also take a hot bath or shower. The heat will help your muscle relax. If you use a bath, shower, or whirlpool, the water should be warm but not too hot., Massaging your muscle with ice may also help with the pain. Ice can also be applied if your muscle is sore or tender after the cramping has stopped.Wrap the ice pack using a thin towel, so that you donâ€™t cause any injury due to excessively low temperatures, such as a frostbite.


Allow the ice to remain on your muscle for 20 minutes and then remove the ice for 20 minutes before reapplying.Freeze water in a Dixie cup and use it to massage your muscle. You should massage the area until it is numb.

 Target shooting? Self-defense? Cheapest for shooting lots of ammunition for fun? All these are different tasks, and take different ammo to do the job best. Not to mention, some firearms will tolerate very "hot" loads, while others will be rapidly worn-out by shooting "hot" ammunition. A dealer or gunsmith can guide someone on a case-by-case, pistol-by-pistol basis.
 You may find a round shoots dirty, doesn't shoot well in your gun, or for other reasons don't meet your expectations. This trial and error is the best way to refine your choice in the long run.

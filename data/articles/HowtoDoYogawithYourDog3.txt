 Some major cities have yoga studios, usually referred to as doga studios. These might be through yoga studios, speciality doga studios, or the Human Society.If you canâ€™t find anywhere to do doga with your dog, then you can do it in your home. Many moves are easy enough for you and your dog to get maximum benefits.
Ask yoga instructors if they would be willing to start a doga class. Or ask if they would let you bring your dog to a traditional yoga class.
 Some yoga studios will offer classes that are for both the human and dog. In these classes, the human holds the dog and help him perform the pose. These classes offer modifications for larger or smaller dogs.Other classes may be a traditional yoga class where dogs just walk around while the humans do yoga.
 Since doga has become a widespread phenomenon, there are many resources available. These resources are especially helpful if you are doing doga at home. Check libraries and bookstores for books on doga and doga poses.


You can also purchase doga videos to help with home instruction. You can also find clips and videos on YouTube.

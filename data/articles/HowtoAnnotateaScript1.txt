 Before you start marking up your script, it is a good idea to read through it once and just get a basic understanding of the story. You can read with a pencil in hand and make some general notes in the margins if you like.


For example, you can mark lines that are confusing, surprising, important, or just interesting.You can also look for scenes or lines that are repeated or that seem to connect to other scenes or lines.;
, If you are acting in a stage production, then it is a good idea to put an X through any stage directions included in your script. The director of the production you are working on will probably design his or her own stage directions, so you will probably not need these.If you want to be sure, you can always ask the director if he or she will be following the scripted stage directions before you cross them out.
 There may be times when a word or concept in a script is unfamiliar to you. If this happens, make sure that you look it up. It is important to be fully aware of what your character’s lines mean.You can define unfamiliar words or concepts in the margins of your script or keep a log of them in a journal.
You might have to look up lots of words and concepts if you are working with an old script, such as a play by Shakespeare.
 You may not be able to figure out everything on your own. As you read your script, another way to annotate it is to write down your questions. Then, you can bring up these questions during rehearsal.For example, if you encounter an unfamiliar concept and you don’t quite understand what it means after looking it up and reading about it, then you could include a question about it.
 It is important to read the script multiple times to gain a good understanding of it and to do a thorough annotation. Make sure that you give yourself plenty of time to read through the script at least twice before you start memorizing your lines.

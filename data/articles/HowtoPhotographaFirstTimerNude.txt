 Do the shoot as soon as she’s comfortable; don’t delay unnecessarily. Don’t make a big deal of it. Greet the model warmly with a handshake and chat a bit.;
, Start off photographing the model wearing an outfit.
 Don’t do more than a dozen shots without progressing, unless you feel your model is becoming ill at ease. Props or accessories can help the model feel more comfortable and focus her attention.
, Side or back shots can be mixed in to help the model warm up.
 Simply instruct the model as to how you want her to pose, including her outfit.
 Of course it’s not necessary for your style to include frontal nudity.
 It’s important to keep things moving so the model doesn’t have a chance to feel nervous about why you may be pausing. Keep shooting in a steady (but not rushed) fashion.
 By the time you shoot a model’s first nude, you may have captured over a hundred frames of her in a fifteen or twenty minute warm up, shooting an average of every 10 to 15 seconds.
 By keeping a steady pace, it puts the model into a great mind set to keep working. This helps with all models, but especially first timers.

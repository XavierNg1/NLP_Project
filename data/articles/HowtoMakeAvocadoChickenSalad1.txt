 For the salad, you’ll need 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts that have already been cooked. Use a sharp knife to chop the chicken into ½-inch (1.27-cm) cubes, and set aside for the moment.If you don’t have leftover chicken breasts, you can use store-bought rotisserie chicken, remove the meat from the bone, and chop it into pieces.;
, Place 1 ripe avocado that’s been seeded and peeled into a large bowl. Use a fork to mash the avocado until it is mostly smooth.It’s important to work quickly as you mash the avocado and begin to mix the salad. Avocado can brown very quickly.
 Once you’ve mashed the avocado, add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lime juice to the bowl. Use the fork to stir the juice into the avocado until they are well blended.Adding the lime juice helps keep the avocado from browning because the acid in the juice helps lower the avocado’s pH.
 After you’ve combined the avocado and lime juice, add half a small onion that’s been chopped, 8 grape tomatoes that have been sliced in half, and the diced chicken to the bowl. Use the fork to toss all of the ingredients together so they’re lightly coated with the avocado mixture.If there are other vegetables that you’d like to add to the salad, such as chopped celery, mix them in with onion and tomatoes.
 When the salad is fully mixed, add as much salt as you like to season it. You can eat the avocado chicken salad straight from the bowl or use it as a filling for sandwiches.Store any leftover salad in the refrigerator in an airtight container. It should keep for 1 to 2 days.

 Before you are sure you want to date this girl, you need to know basic facts about her. (eg. her birthday, favorite color, TV shows, music, etc.);
, Ask her brothers, sisters, parents, on their consent. If it's all right with them, you won't feel too worried to date this girl.
 Younger girls will feel afraid if you just burst out and ask them to date you (makes them feel as if you're some sort of creep who preys on young girls). Take some time and get to know her. Then when the time is right, ask her. Don't say "I love you" too soon, either. It scares her away.
 Nowhere too romantic. You don't want her to feel as if you're just trying to get something from her. This will probably result in her dumping you, or feeling afraid of you. A dinner and a movie would be great. Somewhere public.
 Talking about something like sex would place her in an awkward position. Talk about sports, TV, family. Something casual.
 Her house would be good. But not in a bedroom! Try the family room, kitchen, living room. Couches are not very appropriate at the start. Wait until you and her feel more comfortable with each other.
 Since she is younger, a kiss would feel weird and confusing as she probably hasn't much experience. If you do kiss her early on, don't do it every minute.

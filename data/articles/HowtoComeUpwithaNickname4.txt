 This can work in some instances—a scrawny guy ironically giving himself the self-deprecating nickname “Muscle Man” might be funny—but calling yourself “The Chick Magnet” will probably not endear you to most people.
 No one likes the guy who is constantly getting frustrated at people for forgetting to call him "The Terminator." They also tend to be wary of the guy who forces nicknames on people who don't want or like them. Nicknames should be a fun, casual thing. Getting too worked up about it tends to alienate people.
 The point of a nickname is to express friendship and affection. Giving people nicknames that hurts their feelings or makes them uncomfortable is just bullying.If you're unsure about whether a particular nickname is ok, try it out in a one-on-one setting. This will help the other person feel safe to express dislike for the nickname.
If you are having trouble gauging your friend's reaction, ask "Did I make you uncomfortable when I called you _____ just now?" If the answer is yes, don’t try to convince your friend otherwise. Your friend's feelings are more important than your cool idea.Sometimes nicknames that sound insulting are actually just playful teasing between friends. The important difference is in how the nickname makes the other person feel., Most nicknames that stick are snappy and to-the-point. “Cthulu” might seem like a cool idea, but it’s unlikely to catch on. Stick to nicknames that are easy to spell and nor more than a few syllables.
 If you want a nickname to catch on widely, you should pick something that will be appropriate in any situation."Dr. Sexy" is probably not a good idea. If you think a nickname may have a meaning you are not aware of, Google it.

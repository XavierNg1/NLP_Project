 Start with a closed knife to avoid cutting yourself and to complete the trick. You'll be flipping the knife open so you need it closed to start with. Hold out the hand that you use when someone hands you something or when you throw a ball. When holding the knife, stick out that hand.
 Place the knife, lengthwise, along the second joint of your fingers. Now curl your hand in, placing your thumb just under the catch. Flick upward with your thumb against the catch to open it.


Make sure to maintain not a necessarily strong grip, but a firm one as it is easy for the knife to fly out of your hand when flipping it quickly if you have no practice. Do not crush the knife in your grip, but do not hold it loosely either.
 Flip the catch to your right if you are right-handed or to your left if you are left-handed.
 You only need to make a slight jerking motion Pinch the back half of the knife against your thumb and fingers, letting the front half and the blade drop down. Now give a flicking motion and let the front half fly up and hit the back of your fingers.









Knives that are heavier may require more than just a slight jerking motion and you will have to rotate your hand as you flick it to bring the piece up quickly and fluidly.
 Remove all but your forefinger from the knife as it moves up by holding them straight out.The front piece will fly up and hit the back of your forefinger. It is now the back piece.









If you do it wrong, when you flip it closed, the blade half will hit the back of your forefinger. It is recommended practicing with a dull one. Once you get good at it, sharpen the knife., Slip your forefinger out the top and re-engage the latch with your thumb. Repeat the flicking motions to practice.

 However, be careful what you submit, as the app only allows the user to obtain 1000 points per day. But keep it in mind that these points are independent of those you might have submitted via the GasBuddy website.It's not enough to just click the voting buttons marked "This price is correct" or "This price is not correct". You must open the station, tap the "Report Gas Prices", filling in each box that you have the price to and submitting the prices, all to receive your points.
 This could be as simple as watching videos on the app or even submitting prices for high-tech octane and/or diesel or one of the many different challenges you get per week, as these will change often (weekly).

 Sometimes, a general ledger can have a final balance that is unevenly split between credits and debits. Ideally, this balance should be zero, as the credit value should match the debit value. If this is not the case, one or a number of transactions have been recorded improperly. To see if there is such a problem, create a trial balance by adding up all of the credits and debits recorded in each account. This calculated balance is called a trial balance.Before going further, recheck your math adding the credit and debit columns together. If it is still unbalanced, make sure that you didn't place any values in the wrong column., Compare the balances for each account to the transactions that make up that account. If you find an error, go through again and recalculate the account balance using the credit or debit values from each transaction.Follow each transaction to the other account that it effects and make sure an equivalent value for credit was reported for each debit to the original account and vice versa.
 If working from the transactions still fails to balance the accounts, you may have an error in transaction reporting. In this case, you will need to go back to the source material (receipts, invoices, etc.) to locate the source of the imbalance. Check that the transaction in the source material was recorded correctly in every account that it affects. For example, for a customer purchase with cash, check that equivalent entries were made in cash, sales, inventory, and cost of goods sold and that these entries balance to zero.
 After locating all errors you can find and adjusting them to their correct places and values, run another trial balance calculation to make sure that you've fixed the problem. If you haven't, go back and repeat the process, checking back over your work from the first time.

 Know that the breast may become swollen and painful as milk is not released as frequently as it has been accustomed to. Relieve the pressure by expressing a small amount of milk from the breast. Do not remove too much as this will only make the body thinks it needs to produce more milk. The body needs to slowly reduce the amount of milk it thinks the baby needs.
 Massage your breasts in a gentle fashion to prevent milk ducts from becoming clogged and forming tender lumps in the breast. Massaging while in the shower is generally easier and painless, even if the breasts are swollen.
 Alternatively, try placing a few cabbage leaves on the breasts. Cabbage leaves are helpful with pain relief and the milk cessation process.
 You want to wear a firm-fitting bra that has no underwire sewn in. Ill-fitting bras may cause unnecessary discomfort to tender breasts.
 When your baby pleads with you to offer the breast, it can leave you feeling heartbroken, selfish and frustrated. Keep in mind that your baby will adjust to his new feeding schedule soon.
 Nursing has been a special bond between baby and mother that is now coming to an end. It is normal to have feelings of sadness associated with these endings, but these feelings will subside in time.

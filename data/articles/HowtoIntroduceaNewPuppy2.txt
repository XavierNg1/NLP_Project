 Choose a shirt that you don’t mind getting destroyed, just in case the puppy has an accident on it or decides to chew on it. Wearing the shirt overnight will get your scent onto the shirt so that the puppy can get used to it.If you already have a dog, rub the shirt on your dog as well. This will allow the puppy to get used to the smell of your existing dogs before you bring him into your home., Once the shirt has been saturated with your scent and your dog’s scent, take it to the breeder or adoption facility and ask them to place the shirt with your puppy. The puppy will sniff the shirt and get used to the scents of you and your dog., If you already have a dog or dogs, retrieve the shirt from the breeder or adoption facility after the puppy has had a chance to sniff and snuggle the shirt. Allow your dog(s) to sniff the shirt and get used to the smell of the puppy. This process will provide a first introduction for your puppy and your existing dog(s).

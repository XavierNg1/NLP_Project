 Do not tie your hair, however. Instead, hold it in your right hand, with your thumb under the tail and your forefinger on top of it.
 Grab your hair with your left hand. Keeping it spread out and flat, start wrapping it upward around your right forefinger. Work your way from the top of your hair down to the ends.








Make sure that you are wrapping towards the tip of your finger.
Do not twist the hair like a rope. Keep it flat like a sheet. This will give you a tube-shaped roll of hair.
 As you roll your hair, your hair may start to take on a cone shape. This is a good start, but it will be difficult to hold together. Gently push the ends of your hair into the rolled up hair while pulling your forefinger out. Gently hold your rolled up hair with your right hand. It will be wider on the right and narrower on the bottom.
 Spin pins are spiral shaped pins, with two prongs at one end. Insert a spin pin on the right side of the bun, prong-side-down. Grip it by the smooth, folded tip, and twist it in.Insert another pin through the bottom-center of your bun.








Each brand of spin pin may be a little different. In most cases, you will need to twist them in counterclockwise., Since your bun is rolled, it should hold its shape pretty well. You can help the style last longer, however, by lightly misting it with some hairspray.

 Read Vanity Fair, Harper's Bazaar, Elle and Vogue for ideas and news about the latest trends. Use common sense however, and do not try to become someone you're not.
 First off you need a pair of nice, cute, well fitting (not suffocating but not loose) pair of jeans. Try American Eagle, Abercrombie,or Aeropostale. Then buy some cute in-style tees. Read CosmoGirl, Teen Vogue, or Seventeen magazine if you need some ideas., You need some good jeans. (l.e.i, Paris Blues, and Glo by J-Lo usually are good jeans brands.) Then get some shirts. Try not to make the shirts too distracting or too gaudy; the classy look is always attractive.

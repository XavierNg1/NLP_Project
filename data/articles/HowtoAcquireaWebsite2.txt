 There are websites that allow website owners who wish to sell their websites to post listings. Website trading marketplaces can be very convenient for the buyer, but you most likely will not find a good bargain there.
 Using a search engine, browse for websites that fit into your intended market. Skip the big websites that are securely established, as you won't be able to buy those websites without paying a large price. Find websites that aren't too big, have a good amount of consistent content, but have yet to become extremely popular.

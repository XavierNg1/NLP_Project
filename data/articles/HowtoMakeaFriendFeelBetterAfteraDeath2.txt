 You can help a grieving friend by not being afraid to use the word death. Trying to soften the situation by saying something like, "I heard you lost your husband," may make them angry. Their husband is not lost. He is dead.
 Be open and honest when you communicate with a grieving friend. "Sorry" is a good word in this situation.
 It's OK to tell your grieving friend that you don't know what to do, but would like to help in any way. They may ask you to help them sort through photos, go grocery shopping, or help them mow the lawn.

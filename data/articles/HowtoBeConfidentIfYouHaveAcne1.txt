 Everyone has minor imperfections, but they also all have good features too. Instead of focusing on your acne or scars, think about what makes you beautiful. Write a list of what you find beautiful about yourself. Some ideas include:


"I have pretty eyes."
"I have a beautiful smile."
"I have nice hair."
"I am very strong.";
, Your self-worth should not be defined by your appearance. Remember what makes you an unique, interesting individual. Acne cannot take these qualities away from you. Some things to consider include:


What are your talents? What are you good at? Do you have a hobby, such as music or sports? Are you good at dancing or art?
What are positive qualities about your personality? Do you help others? Do other people think you’re funny?
Do you have loving friends and family? Do you have a beloved pet who adores you?

, Positivity begins with you. Each morning, as you get ready, say something positive about yourself in the mirror. This could be about your appearance or your personality. Smile as you say it to increase your confidence.
 When you are feeling down, little reminders can help pick you up. Write a series of positive notes that you can leave around the house. Stick a post-it to your bathroom mirror, and tuck a small note in your wallet. When you are upset about your acne, read these notes to remind yourself of how wonderful you are.Some notes you can leave include:


“You are beautiful/handsome no matter what.”
“You are beautiful inside and out.”
"Your looks do not define you. You are awesome, and no one can take that away from you."

, Do not bottle up your feelings inside. While your acne might make you feel as though you are alone, others will understand what you are going through. Your family and friends can offer you support and advice. Let them know when you are feeling sad about your acne. Express your frustration, and let them know that it makes you feel insecure.If someone says they don’t notice your acne, believe them. They’re probably telling the truth.
If someone tells you to get over it or that everyone gets acne, tell them, “I know that’s true, but it doesn’t stop me from feeling bad about it.” Your feelings are valid.
If you are starting to feel depressed, withdrawn, or anxious because of your acne, you may need to see a therapist or psychologist., There are several online groups where you can discuss your struggles with acne. Other people with similar types of acne can help you find solutions while providing you valuable moral support. To find a group, you can go to a skin care forum, Facebook, or a support group website.

, In the Black Hat Sect method, the main entryway of a space is always the mouth of chi.
 The main entryway always falls in the wisdom, career or helpful people areas.
 For example, if you are analyzing a room, is the entryway in which you're standing in the left, center, or right? The left corner/area is the Wisdom area, as shown on the bagua map. The middle area is the Career area. The right corner/area is the Helpful People area.
 Once you've identified each area of the bagua, go on to the next step.
 Each area of the bagua has a corresponding color and element which are usually (but not always) listed on the bagua map. Example 1: Place a yellow clay (earth) pot in the Health area of a room to enhance your or your family's health. Example 2: Paint the far wall (in the Fame area) a shade of red to attract a more positive reputation or gain recognition.

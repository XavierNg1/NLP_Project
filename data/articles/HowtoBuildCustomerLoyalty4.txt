 Customers expect businesses to have websites. You can use this to your advantageâ€”not only to increase business but also to foster customer loyalty. Your website can be a great platform for you to communicate with your customers. On a website you can let your customers know what you've been doing for them, promote sales and specials, enable customers to sign up for rewards programs, and provide people a way to voice their concerns and offer their compliments.
 Besides having a website you might create a Facebook account and/or a Twitter account for your business. You can post announcements and alerts about your business. Monitor your site(s) for customer feedback.


How do your customers respond to your postings and announcements? Are any customers writing positive reviews, or are they defending you against negative comments?
Besides being able to learn more about your customers and what they want, you can send the most loyal customers personalized thank-you's through social media. Consider sending them discounts or coupons for their loyalty. , People often use social media to follow businesses, usually in order to find discounts and special deals. Use these tools to your advantage by giving your customers exactly what they want, which will make them more likely to remain loyal to you and your brand.
Make sure that your website and social media platforms do more than just explain what your services are and where you are located. For example, if you have a big sale planned, announce it prominently on your website.
 If you use a web-analytics program on your website, you can learn important information about what your customers have shopped for, searched for, or browsed in the past, as well as learn what they're looking for now. This can help you give your customers what they actually want as opposed to what you think they want. Obviously this will further your quest for customer loyalty.

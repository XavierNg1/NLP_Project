 Many cities and towns have entire areas that are dense with ethnic influence.


Explore areas that celebrate different cultures. Talk to local residents and merchants about the customs and traditions in their home countries.
 Most communities offer classes in Spanish, Italian, French and others including Mandarin, Russian and Hebrew, depending on where you live.
 Italian festivals, Chinese New Year celebrations, St. Patrick's Day parades and other community gatherings are a good way to celebrate different cultures and countries.

 Schedule in the time to declutter your home on a regular basis. It is unrealistic to expect yourself to do it all in one go. Allocate a set period of cleaning or "decluttering" time each day or each week.


Try setting an alarm clock. Designate a cleaning chunk of, say, twenty minutes each day or two hours each week. Set the alarm for the appropriate time so that you can throw all of your attention into the act of cleaning. If you are thinking about what you need to do afterward, then you may not get as much cleaning done in this moment.
Try playing music while you declutter your space. Make it a cleaning party! This can make the job much more manageable!;
, Make a list of all of the things that are on your mind at this moment: plans, projects, chores, and commitments. A cluttered physical space can certainly have an impact on your mental peace, but the case may also be that you have too much on your plate. Go through your list and identify the things that are weighing most heavily on your mind. Decide which obligations, if any, you can let go to ease the stress.
 Order your to-do list from most urgent to least urgent. Give yourself time to clean up your life, but make sure that it fits with everything else that you need to do. Make sure that at any given moment, you are performing the task that feels the most important.


The most important task in a given moment may be cleaning, or it may be your job, or it may be taking time for yourself. Remember that you must sometimes put small things in order so that you can clear the way for big things.
Do not forget to maintain perspective. Remind yourself that irrelevant things can feel very pressing when you are swept up in the moment. Keep your priorities straight.

,, Tap water might have a taste that affects the quality of green tea by affecting it's aroma and flavor. However, you can ignore this step if you are not in a hard water area.
 Assume that a teaspoon is equivalent to 3 grams. It has been proved to be the best amount of green tea per cup for a high quality and natural tasting tea.
 The correct temperature should be within the range of 80°C to 85°C or 176°F to 185°F. This is because, when green tea is subjected to high temperatures like that of boiling water, it loses its natural taste and aroma.
 At this point, the temperature is around 93°C or 200°F. Or let the kettle boil and wait 3-4 minutes before pouring it over the tea.
 After passing through the procedure several times, you will be an expert and enjoy the full natural taste of green tea. In addition, you will be able to tell the difference between green tea of low quality and high quality. Enjoy your cup of tea and stir it up!

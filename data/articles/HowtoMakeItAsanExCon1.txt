 Many prisons have staff who will work with you to create a re-entry plan. Ask around. However, many county jails don’t have the staff to help you.If not, you will need to develop a plan yourself.;
, You may have a general idea of what you want to do when you get outside. However, you also need a detailed plan about what you will do as soon as you step outside the prison. This is called your “release plan.”In particular, think about the following as part of your release plan:


Where you will stay the day you are released.
Who will pick you up from prison. If no one will pick you up, you need to know how to get to where you are staying.
How you will pay for food.
How you will pay for prescription drugs. You might walk out with only a 30-day supply (or less). If necessary, you’ll need to find a doctor to get a prescription.
How you will travel to meet a probation or parole officer. You must make your appointments. Remember that public transportation costs money.
Where you can get a state-issued ID card and pay for one.
 A “re-entry plan” has a broader time horizon than your release plan. You might think about what you want to do over the next three or five years. Come up with concrete steps you can take to achieve each goal. A standard re-entry plan will address the following areas:


Education
Employment
Housing
Substance abuse treatment
Health (including mental health)

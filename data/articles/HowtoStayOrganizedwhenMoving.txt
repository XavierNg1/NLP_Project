 Remember lots of big boxes and high-quality packing tape to seal them with.;
, Now decide on a one-letter abbreviation for each room. Kitchen is K, dining room is D, etc. Be careful not to call two rooms by the same letter -- if you have a dining room and a den, you will need to call one D and one something else, like S for study. Don't forget the basement, attic and garage if applicable.
 Make sure each section has 3-4 pages in it. Tear off a piece of masking tape and stick it on either side of the first page of a section, then use the pen to write the one-letter abbreviation on it.
 If you want to be really organised, pack the most important things in the boxes marked K-1 and K-2. For best results, make two identical labels for each box, so that at least two sides will be labeled.
 It will help if you don't pack all that clutter that you really don't need. Don't pack it, just throw it away. Think of packing as a chance to have a clear out.
 For example: "K-1 -- Round serving tray, fragile glass butter dish, coffee mugs, spatulas and muffin pan." Don't write things like "kitchen stuff" or "pans" unless all of your kitchen stuff or pans are in that box. You want detail, so that when you are searching for your special asparagus pot, you don't have to open a dozen boxes labelled "pots" just to find it.
 Voila!

, For example, if "L" stands for "Living room" then print a large sheet of paper with the words "L -- Living Room" and tape it to the door frame of that bedroom. Then you do not have to stand there directing people and the movers do not have to guess which room is which. You can also use index cards taped to the floor with words like "sofa" or "piano" to indicate where certain furniture goes.

 The easiest way to ingest herbal supplements is with a pill or a capsule. This works especially well for kudzu, ginkgo and ginger.
 One of the most popular way to enjoy herbs of any kind is by using them in teas.


Make a hangover tea with Angostura Bitters, which uses the cinchona herb. Just add a few drops of the bitters to a cup of boiling water. Add other herbs such as roselle and tamarind, which will cut down on the bitter taste.
Mix wintergreen into your tea or boiling water for a soothing scent as well as a constructive drink.
 This works especially well with wintergreen or mint oil. Gently massage the leaves or oil into your temples or at the pulse points on your wrists.

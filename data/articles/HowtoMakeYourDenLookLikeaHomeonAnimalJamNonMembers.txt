 Gems is the Animal Jam currency, the more gems you have, the better items you can get. You can collect gems in a number of ways. On the Daily Spin (which now offers diamonds as well) playing games in the Sol Arcade, and in adventures.;
, for a family home you will need quite a lot of stuff. A non members house can hold up to 100 items where as a gold members can have 200. I will include some stuff you should get in the "Things you need" section below.
 Try to get room dividers so you can section things off into smaller rooms. Try making a kids room with 2 sofas and a couple of plushies. (Plushies are available playing the claw machine. It costs 5 gems a go and there a range of animal plushies. Don't get frustrated when you try to try but you don't get any; you will eventually get some.)

, If you can get room dividers try making a kids room, a master bedroom and a living/dining room. In my den my Kitchen is outside as is the bathroom because the area is so small.
 Get a vegetable patch and some chairs, towels, tables and sun loungers. I have some treehouses and 2 boat ponds using the trade system and the treasure map.
 This way intruders can't stay at your den and beg for trades.

 Ants will eat a variety of foods, such as meats, fruits, even dairy. Leftovers from your meals will also suffice. Anything to keep your ants healthy is a great choice.
 It's great to feed your ants fresh food, but you wouldn't want to feed them the most expensive food in your house, right? Keep to a budget. You can feed them whatever you want, but it's up to you to keep the costs low., Shuffle fruits and veggies together to make a small salad, or even mince meat into small bits so that your ants can carry it into their home easily. Keep the food away from chemicals that can harm your ants, such as pesticides., Slowly scrape the fruits, veggies, or meat beside or into the ant's nest to alert the ants of a possible food source being available. Watch as the workers come crawling out of the nest one by one to drag the food back into their home and to their queen.

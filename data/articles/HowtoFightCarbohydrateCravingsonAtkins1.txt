 When you are hungry, you will eat until you are satisfied. When you are satisfying a craving, you may disregard your satiety signals.;
, Hunger has nothing to do with emotion. If you are eating to help yourself handle your feelings, then you are experiencing a craving.
 A growling, panging or hollow stomach is a sign of real hunger, as are feelings of fatigue and lackluster energy levels. If you are not physiologically hungry, then avoid eating until you are.
 If you are eating because you are lonely, then call or go visit a friend. If you are eating from boredom, then go for a walk or take up a hobby. When you are truly hungry, your craving for food will intensify. When you are not hungry, the emotion, but not the craving, will intensify.
 Politely turn down second helpings. Avoid buffet spreads whenever possible.

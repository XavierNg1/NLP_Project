 Combine the beef, pork, breadcrumbs, ½ cup milk, eggs, garlic, and allspice in a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and then mix everything together., The meatballs should be about 2 inches (5.1 cm) in diameter.
 Rotate the sheets halfway through so that the meat cooks evenly.

 Add the flour, whisking for one minute. Slowly whisk in the beef broth and the remaining cup of milk.
 Allow the sauce to continue cooking for another 2 to 3 minutes until it thickens. Remove from heat.
 Pour the sauce evenly over the meatballs and serve immediately.

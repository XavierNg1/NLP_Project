,, Are they girly, elegant, flamboyant, quirky, eccentric, traditional? Do they like practical things they can use or would they appreciate something decorative?

, Do they like chunky jewellery, fun prints, understated, classic styles?

, Perhaps they have just moved to a new home that needs decorating, or they have a stressful job and would benefit from some pampering products?

, Expensive beauty products tend to get put in a drawer for special occasions because the recipient wouldn't necessarily treat themselves when buying something they use every day.
 A frame could hold a cherished photo or poem; a photo album could be filled with photos from a recent event. You could even put together a 'hamper' of gifts, for example if the recipient has just moved house, you could fill a box with relevant treats and useful products (in pretty packaging of course!).
 For example, if they like making jewelry, why not find them a book about it, and maybe include some pretty beads and jewelry making tools. If they like gardening, what about a trug full of things like gardening gloves, secateurs, gardener's hand cream and a book about plants? Or a specialist cookery class and apron for an aspiring chef?

, You can buy boxes with a glass or perspex cover which slides off, allowing you to cover the back with photos, poems, or artwork, and then accessories the interior with mementos relevant to the recipient or memories you share.
For milestone birthdays like 18 or 21, a photo album showing the stages of someone's life is an imaginative and thoughtful idea (and will require some work!), which can be kept forever.
For another milestone birthday idea, or indeed for a christening, why not fill a beautiful hand-painted box with gifts?
A fun idea for little children (or big ones!) is a treasure hunt which reveals progressively larger presents until the grand prize at the end! For this you can find all sorts of little gifts like pencils, hair clips or bath bombs for example.

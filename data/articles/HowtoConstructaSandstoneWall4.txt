 Use your trowel to spread mortar along the corner of your wall. The mortar should be 1” thick and be the width of your perspective wall. Have the parameters of the width of your wall laid out and marked before applying mortar.Continue to spread the mortar out to cover the surrounding three stones.
 Build up the corners as you would if you were laying bricks. Use a spirit level to ensure the quoins are vertical. Next, stretch a level line from one end of the wall to the other, 300mm-400mm above the footing. Move the line up the wall as you build and use it as a guide until you reach the finished height.
 Since you’ve gathered different sized stones, select the necessary stones that will create a level first layer. Place the smaller stones in the gaps in between the larger stones to get an idea what will be level.Remember the order of stones once you find an even pattern.
 Use a mason’s level to periodically check the level of your wall. Before mortaring the smaller stones into the larger ones, measure them with the level. This will give you an idea if you need to cut any of the stones that are especially protruding., After setting the initial stones, apply mortar to the top and sides of the stone. Do not apply mortar to the side that will act as the corner. Be sure everything is even before laying anything on top of the bricks. Use your trowel to apply 1” of mortar to both the sides and top. Smooth the mortar with the trowel and ensure every stone’s mortar application is even.
 As you notice the mortar beginning to settle on the sides, clean off the excess. Use a stiff broom or whisk broom to clean the sides of your wall., If the mortar is partially wet, you can compact it for a stronger finish. Use a concave jointer and run it between the stones. This will also create a cleaner look.


Re-brush after using the jointer for a cleaner look.

 For this project, you will need:

Your yarn-based work
Pins or thumbtacks
A spray bottle filled with lukewarm water.
 Pin your yarn work down before blocking. Make sure that you like how it looks before spraying., Then spray away! This is much easier to do as you won't have to deal with heavy, wet yarn., Once dried, the yarn-based work is blocked.

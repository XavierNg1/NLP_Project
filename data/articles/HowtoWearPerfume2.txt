 Apply perfume immediately after a bath or shower, when possible. Otherwise, thoroughly wash and lotion the areas where you plan on applying perfume.
 Fragrance sets that combine shower gels, body lotions, and perfumes are especially effective, but any soap or lotion that contains similar scent elements will work.


Avoid clashing fragrances. For example, do not wash with a potent fruity shower gel before applying a musky perfume.

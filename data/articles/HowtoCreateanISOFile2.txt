 There are a variety of programs that can be downloaded for free or purchased that will allow you to create ISO files from a CD, DVD, or Bluray Disc (BD). Popular programs include MagicISO, ISO Recorder, and ImgBurn.


Only download programs directly from the developer. If you download the program from another location, you risk malware or adware infection.
 You can usually leave most of the default options as they are. Some programs, such as ImgBurn, come bundled with lots of ad software that needs to be disabled during installation, so make sure that you carefully read each screen before continuing.
 Click the "Create image file from files/folders" or "Make ISO" button to start the project. This will allow you to choose which files and folders you want to add. Creating an ISO from files is a great way to easily transfer or backup multiple folders and files.


Make sure to give the project an accurate or descriptive name so that you know what the ISO contains.
 The exact process will vary from program to program, but usually you can drag-and-drop files and folders into the window, or use the built-in browser to navigate through all of the folders on your computer.
 Click the "Build" or "Copy" button to begin creating the ISO using the files and folders that you selected. The amount of time this will take is dependent on the size of the files and the speed of your computer., Once the ISO has been completed, its ready to be burnt to a disc, uploaded to your online storage, or mounted on a computer to be accessed.


If your ISO file is too big, it may not fit on a disc. CDs can hold around 700MB, DVDs can hold 4.7GB, and Bluray discs can hold up to 50GB.

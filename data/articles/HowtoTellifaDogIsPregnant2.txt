 All dogs react individually to pregnancy. Some may be quieter and more tired early on, but a dog who is unwell may also be quiet, so this sign is an unreliable predictor of pregnancy. The average female dog behaves largely the same as usual until the last third of the gestation.


In the final third of pregnancy, the dog’s size makes it more difficult for her to move around, and she may want to sleep more.
 Towards the end of pregnancy, the dog’s will womb grow larger and take up more space in her belly. She won't be able to accommodate large meals, so she'll start wanting to snack, eating a little at a time more frequently. , When it is nearly time for her to deliver the pups, the dog may start to nest. She will gather blankets or clothing in a secluded place as she prepares a suitable safe warm environment for her imminent new arrivals.


The exact timing of nesting varies from 2-3 weeks to 2 - 3 days prior to giving birth.

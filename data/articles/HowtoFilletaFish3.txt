 Hold the fillet steady on the plate with one hand. Use the other to take a needle-nosed plier and remove the tiny pin bones that are present in the fillets. Some fish meat is quite delicate, and could fall apart if handled roughly, so be careful when you remove the bones.
 This is an optional step. Use the knife to remove the thin, fatty, belly portion of the fish. You can dispose of this meat or use it to make fish stock.
 This is also an optional step, as many prefer to eat the skin. To skin the fish, hold your knife down at one end of the fillet, positioning it between the skin and the flesh. Angle the knife slightly, and slide it through the length of the entire fish, holding tightly onto the skin with your other hand. Repeat with the other fillet.

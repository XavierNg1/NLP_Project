 Place it on a flat work surface, such your bed or the counter in your laundry room. Straighten it out and position it so that the waistband is pointing away from you.
 Bring the left side of the waistband to the center of the thong, then cross the right side of the waistband over it. The waistband will be folded into thirds.
 The bottom edge of the crotch and the top of the waistband should now be aligned.
 The thong is now folded and ready to stack. Try storing your thongs stacked upright (crotch-side down) in a narrow box or drawer organizer to keep them neat.

 This is essential for designing an outdoor kitchen that is functional. Your island should include storage, a sink, and a built in refrigerator to keep things cold. You can have one built of wood but pavers will last longer with less maintenance.
 No outdoor kitchen is complete without an BBQ or grilling station. Use the same pavers as your kitchen island for a high-end, customized look.
 Make sure you can cook outdoors, regardless of the time of day. Have lighting installed so you can move around comfortably. Consider lighting in the flooring, overhead lights hung from a pergola, or wall sconces built into a privacy wall made of pavers.
 Make sure that your guests can join you in the kitchen space by providing seating. This can be at the kitchen island or in an outdoor dining room.
 You can have a gorgeous outdoor fireplace made of pavers. This can match the kitchen island and BBQ area for a cohesive design that is stunning and practical. A fireplace will add warmth and make it easier to enjoy your kitchen year round.
 Place them within easy reach of your cooking space so that meals prepared outdoors are made with fresh ingredients. This will make your food taste even more amazing.

 An example would be a food drive, where non-perishable foods are collected to distribute to the under resourced in the community. When the food is collected, it must be sorted and inventoried so the group responsible for distribution can arrange carrying out that job.;
, Local food banks, relief organizations, the Salvation Army, or religious institutions are examples.
 You will also need to make sure the items you sort will be safe there.
 Coordinate this with the volunteers you are assembling and the organization you are doing the project for.
 Sorting donated clothing may be accomplished best using a variety of cardboard boxes, so check with merchants to see if they can save good, clean boxes of assorted sizes sufficient for task. Plastic or paper grocery bags might work fine for foodstuffs.
 If none are willing to help, take up a collection among the volunteers themselves, or provide them yourself.
 Local newspapers or radio stations may be willing to give free advertising or airtime for the event, and it may be possible to have live broadcasts from the local media for large events. This might help increase the charity's community support.
 Once you have taken the donated articles out of their original containers or packaging, they should be sorted and repackaged or placed in containers before you quit the project.

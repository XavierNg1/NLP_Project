 Look up your university’s official page on social media sites like Facebook. Start looking for freshers who are travelling from international destinations like you. Contact them and ask if they are looking for accommodation. This is one of the best ways for one-to-one interactions and also helps you learn about your classmates or future roommates.
 You can mention your requirements on other social media sites like Twitter, Linkedin, etc. to get spotted by oversea landlords and real estate agents. You can ask in detail about the property and the cost of living.
 Make sure that you don’t miss out on any good offers. Respond immediately to emails or messages that have been left behind by the landlord.

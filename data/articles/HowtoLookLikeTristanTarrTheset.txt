 Make sure you have a random swirl at the top of the 'do, looking to the also popular eighties band Flock of Seagulls for reference. Hair must be cut around shoulder length and preferably straightened. To add on to the look, make your hair greasy and finger-lickin' good.;
, Or, if this type of shirt is unavailable to you just wear a simple red tee. Again, the red is to compliment the freckles and complexion. On those cold breezy days, a slightly "shrunken-in-the-wash" hoody will keep you nice and toasty.
 To create his already established look, you must wear cutoffs! Preferably, cut your jeans just above the knee with bits and pieces of jean frays at the hemline. Legs must always be covered in sweat from excessive drum playing.
, One piercing will suffice on the left hand side of your lips. If desired, a simple red bandanna (also to compliment your rosy cheeks and complexion) may be tied around your neck or around your forehead. A water bottle for constant hydration (view: Personality, Diet) may also add to the "physique."

Music, in some ways, influences his personality. When working with fellow co-workers you must always enjoy singing along to whatever song is playing and enjoying yourself. When at shows, your personality is very much like at the work environment - you enjoy singing along to what ever is playing.

Sometimes to make the effect even greater, you thrust along with the beat as well.

 Before you begin writing a screenplay it is a good idea to read and analyse screenplays to your favorite films and similar films to yours.;
, By breaking down screenwriting into manageable chunks and working out a deadline it will give you motivation.


Time. A micro-budget short film should take a few weeks to conceive and edit. Don't feel too pressured though as this may put you off instead just focus on writing 10 minutes a day.
 Work in a calming environment.

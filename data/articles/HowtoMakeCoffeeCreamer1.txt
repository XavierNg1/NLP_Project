 Place the nuts in a skillet over medium heat. Cook them until they begin to brown and give off an aroma. Stir them constantly while cooking to prevent them from burning.;
, Remove the hazelnuts and place them on a kitchen towel. Set them aside until they're completely cool. They should be around room temperature and cool to the touch.


Fold your towel over the nuts once they cool.
Give the towel a good shake. This will remove most of the husks from the nuts.
 Place the condensed milk, sugar, hazel nuts, and vanilla extract into a blend. Blend for about 15 seconds. You want the nuts broken into small chunks but not completely dissolved in the liquids.
 Heat the blend in a saucepan over low heat. Keep heating until the creamer is warm. It should not be boiling hot, but warm tot he touch.
 Steeping means soaking dry ingredients in liquid so the liquid can absorb the flavor.You should steep your hazelnuts for about 30 minutes.


Strain the liquid into the container. You now have hazelnut creamer.

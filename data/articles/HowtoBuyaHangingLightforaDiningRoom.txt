 Your dining room lighting should be to scale in relation to the size of your room. The following guidelines may be used as a reference, although factors like the table shape and size and the décor/style of the dining room should also be taken into consideration:


For a room that is 10 feet (3.0 m) by 10 feet (3.048 m by 3.048 m), choose a light that is somewhere around 18 inches (45.72 cm) in diameter.
For rooms that are 11 feet (3.4 m) by 11 feet (3.35 m by 3.35 m) to 13 feet (4.0 m) by 13 feet (3.96 m by 3.96 m), then you should find a hanging light that measures about 24 inches (61 cm) in diameter.
Rooms that measure between 14 feet (4.3 m) by 14 feet (4.27 m by 4.27 m) and 18 feet (5.5 m) by 18 feet (5.49 m by 5.49 m) can visually support a lighting fixture that measures anywhere from 26 inches (66.04 cm) to 36 inches (91.44 cm) in diameter.
Your dining room lighting should also be height proportionate. For each 1 foot (.3048 m) of wall height, give 2.5 inches (6.125 cm) to 3 inches (7.62 cm) to your fixture. For example, a dining room that is 9 feet (2.74 m) high can house a lighting fixture that is 22.5 inches (57.15 cm) to 27 inches (68.58 cm) tall.;
, A good rule of thumb is to choose a hanging light that is half of the width of your table.
 Once you have the approximate parameters for the size of your lighting fixture, it is important to assess the design of the fixture itself in order to determine the appropriate choice for your dining area. For example, a bulky, ornate dining room chandelier has a visually heavier feel than a simple pendant light, and takes up more space aesthetically. You should therefore choose a visually heavy fixture that is at the smaller end of your diameter guidelines, or a visually light fixture that is on the larger end of your diameter guidelines.



Decide between pendant lighting or a dining room chandelier. Pendants are hung by stems, as opposed to chandelier chains, and are typically a simple stem and bulb housing design. Chandeliers are more traditional dining room lighting fixtures, and are generally circular in shape and more complex in design than pendant lighting. Pendant lighting provides a streamlined, modern effect, while chandeliers are more ornate.
Pick a finish that matches the hardware throughout your house. For example, if your buffet knobs are a brushed nickel, then you should choose a lighting fixture in the same brushed nickel finish.
Counter the weight of the furniture with your hanging light. If your dining room set is dark and bulky, then opt for a simple lighting fixture with a lightweight feel.
 There are many sources for dining room lighting, including websites, home improvement stores, retail department stores, yard sales, specialty lighting stores and classified ads. Be sure to ask about installation before you make a purchase.

 Brush your hair to remove any knots and tangles. A sock bun typically does not have a part, although you can include one if you would like.
 Select the place on your head you would like to create your sock bun. A popular trend now is to have it placed on the top of your head, similar to a topknot. You can have a more classic look by pulling your hair near the base of your neck though. Secure your handful of hair with an elastic.
 Take an old (clean) sock, and cut the closed end near the toes off. It is best if you use a sock similar in color to your hair, but any color will do. You should be left with an empty sock-tube. Roll it up (similar to how you would with nylons) so that your sock is no longer a tube, but a donut shape.
 Take your sock and slide it onto your ponytail all the way to the base. This is to make sure that all of the strands are included. Then, hold your ponytail up and slide the sock all the way to the end of the ponytail.
 Wrap the ends of your hair around the sock donut, so that they form a loop and the ends are placed in the center hole of the sock.
 As you roll the sock towards the base, your hair will gather in loops around it.









Move the hair around as you roll the sock, so that it doesn’t all loop around the same section leaving the rest of the sock exposed.
 Although it should be stable with just the sock, if you are concerned about your hair falling out you can use a few bobby pins to secure it to your scalp.
 Pull out a few strands if you want to create a messier sock-bun, and then spritz your hair with a bit of hairspray to set it. Include any cute hair accessories you might like, and you’re finished!

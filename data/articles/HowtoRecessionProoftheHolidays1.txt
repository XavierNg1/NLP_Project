 Prepaid cards will allow you to keep better track of your spending, and may prevent you from being tempted to withdraw additional funds. For example, if your holiday shopping budget is 100 dollars, purchase a 100-dollar prepaid debit card, and stop buying gifts when there are no funds left on the card.;
, Most retailers will allow you to apply rewards points toward purchases during the holidays, or provide you with options for redeeming your points. For example, if you have 12 dollars saved in rewards points, use those points to purchase a holiday gift for a friend or family member.
 Groupon and Living Social are examples of websites that provide you with coupons for major retailers, which you can then use in stores or online to receive discounts.


Browse the application store or market on your smartphone to locate apps that provide coupons and discounts. Some apps have been developed to alert you about sales at nearby retailers, or to provide you with coupons for major retailers when they become available.
 Examples of gifts you can give are year-long subscriptions to magazines or movie rentals, or year-long car wash subscriptions that allow for one free car wash per week.
 Gift cards such as these can be purchased at most major retail locations, and your friends and family also being impacted by the recession will be thankful to receive these types of gifts.
 In time of recession, some may lack health insurance or healthcare options. For example, buy a gym membership or tracksuit for a friend or family member, which they can then take advantage of, and reduce overall trips to the doctor or healthcare provider.

 This process is called parboiling: it reduces the amount of time the sausages have to be on the grill and simplifies the grilling process. You can parboil sausage in advance so it is "grill-ready."


Place the sausage in a heavy skillet on the stove. Add just enough water to cover the links. Use chicken or beef broth, beer or wine instead of water for unique taste combinations. If you are using water, add onions, garlic or your favorite seasonings.
Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat to maintain a low boil until the links are gray throughout.;
, Par-boiled links can also be frozen for 2 to 3 months.
, Use tongs, taking care not to puncture the sausage skin. The skin on the sausage holds the juices inside and promotes even cooking.
 Cook sausage made with pork to an internal temperature of 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 Celsius) and poultry sausage to 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 Celsius).

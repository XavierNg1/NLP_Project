 On your smartphone, look for the icon that features a blue box with the white Twitter bird and tap it to launch the Twitter app.


Similarly, you can open a web browser on your desktop computer, and visit the Twitter website there.
 Enter your Twitter handle and password into the given fields and tap/click “Sign in” to access your account.


The desktop version will feature your login text fields on the top right side of the page.
 For smartphone users, the Twitter app’s post box is at the bottom, a text box that says, “What’s happening.” If you are using the desktop website, you can find the Twitter post box at the top of the screen, next to your profile picture.
 You have to make sure you do it in this format: @TwitterHandle. Type the @ symbol and Twitter handle of the person you want to talk to.
 Once you have done that, type in the message that you want them to see. You can enter up to 140 characters.
 Your tweet will go onto your feed, and the person that the tweet is directed to will get a notification.

 In a large stock pot over medium heat, melt 1/4 cup butter. Add the garlic and onions, and cook until tender and fragrant, about 8 to 10 minutes., To the saut√©, add broth, squash, and herbs, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat, bringing the soup to a simmer, and cook until squash very soft and tender, about 20 to 25 minutes., Using an immersion blender, or a food processor, puree the squash mixture thoroughly. If using a food processor, blend the soup in batches, about 2 cups at a time. Return the puree to the pot., Add cream and sugar to the puree, and heat until at a very low simmer. Season with salt and pepper to taste., Ladle the soup into deep bowls, top with croutons and shredded gruyere, and serve with torn chunks of crusty fresh bread, a winter greens salad (spinach, escarole, and radicchio topped with sugared walnuts or marcona almonds), and a crisp, rich viognier., It's soup time!

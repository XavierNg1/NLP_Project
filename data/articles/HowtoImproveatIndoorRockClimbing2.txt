 Your forearms make it possible for you to grip and hold onto your handholds. If your forearms are weak, then you may not be able to hang on for long. To strengthen your grip, do exercises that target your forearm muscles.Try getting a grip exerciser. These are handheld training devices that you squeeze with your hands to improve your grip.
 Having good arm and shoulder strength can also make it easier for you to hold onto your handholds. To increase your arm and shoulder strength, include some pull ups and chin ups in your exercise routine.If you canâ€™t do a chin up or pull up yet, then include some weight training exercises that use the same movements, such as pull downs and presses.
 Your entire core will be engaged while you are climbing, so it is important to strengthen these muscles. You can do crunches, side crunches, planks, and other core strengthening exercises to build up your core strength.Try holding a plank pose for 30 to 60 seconds once or twice per day.

Do an abdominal workout a few times per week.
 If you have poor balance, then this may make it harder for you to make certain transitions or stick on certain points as you climb. Incorporating some balance exercises into your routine can make it easier for you to handle balance-testing moments in your climbs.Try standing on one foot in front of the climbing wall and lifting one foot in front of you. Then, point your toe and touch the tip of your toe to different footholds on the wall. Make sure that the moves are slow and controlled. Then, repeat the exercise with your other foot.
 Being flexible will also help you to be a better climber, so always take time to stretch your muscles after you have trained them. You can sue a combination of yoga poses and traditional stretches to improve your flexibility. Some good stretches to use in your training routine include:



Frog pose.

Forward bend.

Cobra pose.

Shoulder and arm stretches.
Leg Stretch

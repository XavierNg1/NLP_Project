 Don't spread the germs around your entire office or classroom, too. You probably weren't going to get a lot done at work or school with your head stuffed up, anyway. You're better off staying home, getting plenty of rest and fluids, and going back in a day or two when the symptoms subside.


Don't use all your sick days for playing hooky from work. They are there in case you are sick, and you don't want to be the boy who cried wolf when credibility with your boss and co-workers is at stake.
If there's something that can't wait, log in from home or telephone a colleague to cover for you while you're sick.
Remember, you'll just slow everybody down even more if you give this cold to several colleagues or classmates.;
, Even if you usually carry a handkerchief, use tissues for colds and dispose of them. Don't put them in your pocket.
 A tissue is ideal, but if none is handy, sneeze or cough into your bent elbow rather than into your hand.
 You should be doing this anyway, but take special care now. Remind others who live with you to do the same.
 Doorknobs, light switches, keyboards, mice, and telephones are good places to start, but watch what else you touch. This is a good job for one of those disinfecting wipes or a bit of spray cleaner on a soft cloth.
 As the symptoms start to subside, a bit of extra laundry can go a long way toward keeping the rest of the family healthy.
 Try to get a little bit of extra ventilation into your home, even if it's winter. Use your judgment.

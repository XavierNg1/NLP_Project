 This method is intended for those small diffusers that you plug into your wall. They are about the same size as nightlights and have a small glass jar or bulb attached to the bottom.
 In most cases, you will need to twist the bulb counterclockwise.
 This will help pop the cap out.


Some wicks may have a nail inserted through them. In this case, you may need to use a pair of needle-nose pliers to pry it out., Be aware that some wicks have a sharp nail poked through them., You can even combine different oils to create your own unique scent.


Some of the oil scent will remain. When adding a new scent, consider using something that is similar to the old one.This will ensure that you don't end up with something that smells unpleasant.
 You need that extra space for the wick. If you are using a bulb-shaped diffuser, then fill it to just below the widest point., If you took the wick out of the cap, then put it back in first. Try to pop the cap straight down, applying even pressure. Wiggling it back and forth will not be as effective., This will blend the oil and water together. Don't worry if your mixture looks cloudy; this is normal, because you are using essential oils.
 The fragrance will be more subtle than the store bought fragrance because you are using natural, essential oils. It will take only a fraction of the cost to make, however!

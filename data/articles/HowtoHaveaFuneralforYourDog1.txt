 Pet funeral homes offer services including picking up your pet’s remains from your home or the vet and preparing your pet’s body for viewing. These facilities can also arrange for your pet’s body to be cremated or buried.Once you decide on a pet funeral home to help you arrange your dog’s funeral, you will want to visit the facilities to make sure they can offer what you desire.;
, If you won’t be using the services of a pet funeral home, you will need to decide exactly where you would like the service to take place. For many dog owners, a funeral in your backyard will be the obvious choice. For others, a service near one of the dog’s favorite places, such as the beach, forest, or park, will be fitting. If you decide to hold the funeral in a public space, however, make sure you acquire the proper permits or clearances ahead of time.
 You might decide you want a private service for your dog with only close family members present. On the other hand, you might wish to invite extended family, friends, and co-workers to your dog’s funeral. Ask the pet funeral home to announce the service on their website, or in the local paper if desired. You can also invite guests via telephone, email, or social media.


An invitation can ask your friends to join you in remembering your dog. It should include the place and time for the funeral service.
 If you are holding your own funeral for your dog, you may want to set up a viewing area for your dog’s remains. If you are planning on burying your dog, you might want to consider purchasing a dog casket and displaying it on a table. If your dog has been cremated, you can similarly display the urn on a table.You can decorate the viewing area with photographs, a collar, your dog’s tags, or a few of your dog’s favorite toys.
If you do not have an urn or casket, consider placing a large framed photo of your pet on a table instead.

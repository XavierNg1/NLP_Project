 You cannot send messages from the Facebook app. You'll need to use the Messenger app from Facebook instead. Messages sent in Messenger can be read in the Messenger app or on the Facebook website.;
, On Android, tap the "+" button in the lower-right corner and select "Write Message." On iOS, tap the "New Message" button in the upper-right corner, which looks like a paper and pencil.
 Type the name of the first person you want to add to the conversation. As you type, you'll see matches from your friends list below. Tap the person that you want to add.
 After adding the first person, keep typing to find a second person. Keep tapping results and adding people until you've added everyone you want to send the message to.
 Tap the "Write a message" field after you've added all the recipients and begin typing your message. You can tap the various options above the text field to insert objects such as photos, emoji, animated gifs, and more.
 Tap the "Send" button when you're ready to send the message. On Android, the Send button looks like paper plane. All of the recipients will receive the message, and any replies will be send to the entire group.
 Messenger allows you to change the name of a group conversation so that it isn't just a list of all the recipients. The process is a little different for Android and iOS devices:


Android - Open the group conversation and tap the ⓘ button in the upper-right corner. Tap the ⋮ button and select "Change name." Enter the new name for the group conversation.
iOS - Open the group conversation and then tap the current name at the top of the screen. Tap "Edit" in the upper-right corner, then select "Change name." Type the new name for the group conversation.

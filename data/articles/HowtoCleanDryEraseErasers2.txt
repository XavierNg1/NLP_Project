 When you clean your dry erase erasers with a garden hose, you will end up spraying inky-colored water on the ground. So first, choose a location to do your cleaning, ideally on a patch of grass., Bring your dry erase erasers outside, set them on the ground, and spray them with your hose. If your hose has multiple settings, use the most powerful one. The power from the hose spray will penetrate the cracks of the eraser and remove the ink. Continue until the water runs clear., Place your dry erasers in direct sunlight and let them sit for 1-2 hours. Do not attempt to use the erasers until they are completely dry. In the meantime, put away your garden hose.

 Make sure that the shoe is the appropriate length and width for your child’s foot. If a shoe squeezes a child’s foot too much, it can cause the child to have foot conditions such as blisters and calluses. Remember that your child’s foot will grow at a rapid pace and that he may need to be fitted every few months for a new size. So, if your child takes off his shoe and you notice that there are red marks on your child’s foot, it may be time to take your child in for a new fitting and buy him a new shoe.;
, You will want to make sure that the upper level of the shoe is made from a comfortable material. You will want the material to be one that is flexible and breathes well so that your child’s foot will not sweat and so that the top of the shoe does not push down on your child’s foot. Some good materials are leather and canvas. There are also some shoes that are made out of a mesh material that can help your child’s foot to breathe better. Make sure that the shoe is made of absorbent material to help absorb sweat and also make sure that the shoe has a good gripping on the bottom. You will not want to buy your child a shoe that makes him slip and slide around. Safety should always be your number one priority when purchasing shoes for your child.
 If you are buying a shoe for a baby that only crawls, you will only need to buy booties or no-slip socks that are designed to keep your child’s foot warm. If you are buying a shoe for a child who is just learning to walk, you will need to make sure that the child has a shoe that helps with the walking process and does not hinder it. You will want to make sure that the shoe is comfortable and safe. Choose a shoe that is light and will not cause your child to sweat and become uncomfortable.

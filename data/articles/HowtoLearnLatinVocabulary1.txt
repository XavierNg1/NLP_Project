 Take a blank piece of paper and draw a line down the middle. On one side of the line, write down the vocabulary word. On the other side of the line, write the English meaning. Go though your list of words one by one, familiarizing yourself with each word and its meaning.;
, Cover the English meaning and practice saying what the Latin form of the word is English. When you're comfortable stating the English definitions, switch things up and cover the words in the Latin column so you an state the Latin terms for the English definitions.Repeat the exercise until you can confidently give English definitions for Latin terms, and Latin terms for English definitions.
Scramble up the list of words and continue to alternate with covering up each word and its meaning. This will help you focus more on memorizing the word and less on memorizing the order of your vocabulary words.
 Repeat each word without looking at its meaning. If you get the answers incorrect, go back and look at the word and its meaning again without covering anything. Read the word without looking at the answer again and repeat it multiple times until you got it down.
 Keep a notebook in which you write down the vocabulary words and English meanings. Writing down each word can help you remember what the words look like.


Draw pictures next to the vocabulary words if you want to learn them even better. This is especially helpful if you are a visual learner.
Regularly incorporate different words onto your desired vocabulary list. Revisit the vocabulary words that you’ve already learned whenever revising your list. Test yourself on how well you’ve mastered those words before moving onto a new set of words.

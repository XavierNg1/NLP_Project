 When stains occur, Sunbrella suggests spot cleaning. Mix up the same solution you’d use for general cleaning in a spray bottle. Spray it directly on the stain and let it soak for at least 15 minutes., If you’ve spilled something oily, like sunscreen, it may stain the fabric. Sprinkle corn starch over the affected area. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then proceed with the cleaning process.Corn starch acts as an absorbent and helps to soak up the oily residue.
Use a straight-edge or ruler to scrape away the dried corn starch after 10 minutes have passed.
 Scrub gently at and around the stain until it disappears. If the stain isn’t coming clean, reapply the cleaning solution and let it soak a little longer before scrubbing it again. Rinse the area with clean, fresh water to remove all soap residue. , Dab a fresh towel or sponge at the spot, soaking up as much excess moisture as you can. If you have a wet-vac, that also works well. Allow the fabric to air dry the rest of the way., Sunbrella cushions are formulated to prevent the growth of mold and mildew, but it can still occur. Combine 1 cup (120 ml) bleach, ¼ cup (30 ml) mild soap and a gallon of lukewarm water in a bucket. Pour it into a spray bottle., Be sure to mist the affected area thoroughly, but also apply it to the entire surface of the cushion. If you only concentrate on the affected spot, a water ring or light stain may form. Let the solution sit on the fabric for about 15 minutes., After 15 minutes, wipe the surface of the cushions with a sponge or scrub with a soft bristle brush. To avoid rings and stains, be sure to clean the entire cushion from seam to seam. This should take care of even tough mold and mildew stains., Thoroughly rinse your cushions to remove all traces of the bleach solution. Let them air dry. Setting them out in direct sunlight can help speed up the drying process.

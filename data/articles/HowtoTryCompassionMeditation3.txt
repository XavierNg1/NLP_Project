 Begin meditating in a quiet, calm, relaxing environment. This may be quiet room in your home or an undisturbed area outside. Get into a relaxed position where you are comfortable. Sit on the floor or bed or lie flat.Make sure you are undisturbed during this time. Get rid of all electronic devices.
 As you begin, focus on your breathing. Inhale slowly through your nose. Your abdomen should expand while you inhale. Exhale slowly, letting all the air leave your body until your belly is flat. This should take around two to three seconds.Continue breathing in this way for a few minutes.
Pay attention to each breath as you breathe in and out. Focus on the moment and be aware of your breathing and body.
 Compassion meditation doesn’t just extend to others. You can also practice self-meditation. As you breathe, think of your own suffering. What conflicts or sufferings have you experienced?Think of a time when you experienced loss, faced a conflict, were injured, or were physically ill.
 As you visualize and name your suffering, pay attention to how this makes you feel. How does your heart and soul feel? Do you feel happy and open? Or do you feel an ache or other unpleasant sensation?Acknowledge and name your feelings. These may be positive or negative feelings.
 As you breathe, focus on letting go of your suffering. Imagine that your pain and suffering is connected to a light, balloon, cloud, or bubble. Think about yourself and your feelings and that the light is helping you feel better or that the balloon is filling with the negative feelings.As you exhale, feel each negative thought lessen and drift away.
Tell yourself, “I am not free from this pain” or “I will now have peace and happiness.”

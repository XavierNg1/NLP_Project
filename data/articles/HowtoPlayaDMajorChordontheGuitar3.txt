 First, use your index finger to cover every string on the 5th fret, save the low E. Then, place your middle finger on the 7th fret of the 4th (D) string; your ring finger on the 7th fret of the 3rd (G) string; and your pinkie finger on the 7th fret of the 2nd (B) string. Make sure that you are holding each string down firmly. Then, strum slowly down from the 5th string to the 1st string.









Make sure to leave the top (low E) string untouched. If you play the 6th string, here, then it won't be a D major chord., First, use your index finger to hold down every string on the 10th fret. Then, place your middle finger on the 11th fret of the 3rd (G) string. Put your ring finger on the 12th fret of the 5th (A) string, and put your pinkie finger on the 12th fret of the 4th (D) string. Strum the chord in a single sweep, from the 6th (low E) string to the 1st (high E).
 The barre chords are more technically complex than the open D major, and they require much more finger strength. Work on pressing your index finger against the fretboard. Make sure that you can hold down all of the strings firmly enough that you create a crisp, clear-sounding chord.









If the chord comes out twangy or muted, then you are not holding the strings down firmly enough. Pluck each string individually while you hold the barre chord shape. If a particular note doesn't sound clear, shift your finger around until you can play it crisply. Make sure that your fingers are as centered as possible between the frets, and that none of your fingers are accidentally muting other strings.
If you move these barre chord shapes up and down the fretboard, you can play any chord. Two frets higher, for instance, makes a C major chord. Two steps lower makes an E major chord.

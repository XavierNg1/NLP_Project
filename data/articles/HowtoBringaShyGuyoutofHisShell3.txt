 Shy guys often have a hard time reaching out to make plans because it makes them feel pressure and puts them in a vulnerable position. Save him the stress and just make the plans yourself. Try to cater to his comfortability by suggesting interaction that’s less communicative early on, such as going to see a movie together., He's not going to open up to you overnight, so don’t get frustrated if progress seems slow. Rushing may only intimidate him, so as your relationship grows, suggest the next move, but try to keep things at his pace. Building trust and comfort takes time. If you really want to show that you care for him, make it clear that you’re okay with that.He may seem awkward around you at first. Be persistent and compassionate.
 Don’t let your pride get in the way of making the first move. Especially if he’s really interested in you, it may come as a great relief to a guy who's a bit reserved if you ask him out or tell him you have feelings for him first. He may have really wanted to tell you, but his shyness just kept him from putting himself in a such a vulnerable position.

Influence - Influence is defined by the number of followers you have (relative reach), number of times you are "retweeted" (relative authority), the number of times you "retweet" (relative generosity), the number of times that you are referenced by others (relative clout), and the number of updates you publish over a seven day period (relative velocity).Tips are offered in how to improve your influence.


Learn what your signal to noise ratio is. This measures your tendency to share information rather than anecdotes. This is measured by:

References to other people (defined by the use of "@" followed by text)
Links to URLs you can visit (defined by the use of "http://" followed by text)
Hashtags you can explore and participate with (defined by the use of "#" followed by text)
Retweets of other people, passing along information (defined by the use of "rt", "r/t/", "retweet" or "via")Generosity is measured by just one thing. Your tendency to share good info and tweets with others by retweeting.
Velocity is measured by how much you contribute to Twitter. This is judged against a theoretical maximum of 1500 contributions in a week.Clout is considered special pull or influence. Twitalyzer's definition of clout is as follows:

"Our definition of clout is simply the number of references to you divided by the total number of possible references (as governed by the Twitter Search APIs)."

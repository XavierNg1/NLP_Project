You may be better off buying a new doll than trying to clean or restore dolls with synthetic hair., Not all doll's hair should be washed. The American Girl corporation, for example, advises against washing your doll's hair. They provide a number you can call for advice in the event your doll's hair gets damaged.If you still have manufacturer's instructions for your doll, read them before attempting to wash your doll's hair on your own.
 If you have a mechanical doll that's still functioning, do not wash its hair. Even if you're careful about keeping your doll's body dry, even a small amount of water could cause damage.

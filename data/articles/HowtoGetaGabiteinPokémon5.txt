 You'll need to defeat the Legendary Pokémon in your game before Gible will appear. This will happen automatically as you get close to the end of the story., Once you've defeated Groudon or Kyogre, head to Route 111 to try to track down a hidden Gible. Route 111 connects Mauville City and Route 112., This will appear on your bottom screen, and you'll hear the hidden Pokémon cry. Note that there are three different Pokémon that can appear as hidden Pokemon, so it may not be a Gible., It will be moving between several deep sand tiles. As you approach, you'll see a silhouette of the hidden Pokémon on your map. You have about 100 seconds from when you're alerted to encounter the hidden Pokémon or it will run away.

Make sure to sneak by gently pushing the circle stick to move when you get close to where the Pokémon is hiding.
 If you get lucky and the hidden Pokémon is a Gible, you can lower its health and capture it in a Poke Ball. The Gible will be Level 23., Since the Gible you catch is Level 23, it only needs one level to evolve into Gabite. You can use a Rare Candy or have your Gible win a few fights.

 Statins are medications that are effectively used to lower blood cholesterol levels. However, one of their side effects is rhabdomyolysis or breakdown of muscle tissue due to inflammation. Because of this mechanism, these drugs cause an elevated CPK level. Examples of statins include:


Simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin.
 If you are taking any of the drugs listed in this step, they might be the reason for your elevated CPK levels so you should talk to your doctor about trying different medications to treat your conditions. Other medications that can increase CPK levels include:


Amphotericin B (an antifungal).
Ampicillin (an antibacterial).
Some anesthetics.
Anticoagulants such as aspirin, heparin and warfarin.
Dexamethasone (a steroid).
Clofibrate (another cholesterol-lowering drug).
Furosemide (a diuretic).
Morphine (a pain reliever).
 If you are taking any of the above-mentioned medications and are having an issue with elevated CPK levels, you might want to consider trying different medications. You can consult your doctor, tell him or her of your elevated CPK levels, and ask for a revision of your prescription.If you canâ€™t get a different prescription, your doctor will work with you to find another way to bring your CPK levels down.

 When people are given foods that they like, they tend to eat more than they otherwise would. This isn't limited to dessert, either: think about waffles, pancakes, soups, sandwiches, noodles, fruits, and whatever she loves to eat.


Make deals with her where she earns something extra special. For example, if she finishes a draft of her essay by Sunday at 6 pm, you'll make waffles the next day.
Offer to take her to the grocery store so she can help pick out foods she likes.
 Try peanut butter, cheese, yogurt, nuts, ice cream, milkshakes, lean meats, and red meats.
 Instead of skim milk, buy 2% milk. Get regular ice cream and yogurt instead of "half the fat."


If you don't want other people eating this (e.g. if she has a brother who overeats), then buy both versions. When her brother asks for ice cream, give him the lowfat version, and give her the regular version. Make sure that they aren't paying close attention when you're serving their ice cream.
Buy her favorite flavors with higher fat. For example, if she loves rocky road and her brother likes mint chocolate chip, buy the regular rocky road and the reduced fat mint. Even if she eats the mint ice cream sometimes and her brother wants rocky road once or twice, on average she'll be eating more fat.
 Using every opportunity to pack in the calories will help her weight increase. Avoid diet sodas, which are low-calorie and empty of nutrition.Snacking regularly will help her gain weight.

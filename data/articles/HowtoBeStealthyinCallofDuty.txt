 Silence is the key to stealth. So therefore when you’re at the beginning of a match, be sure to have both weapons attached onto a silencer. This away whenever you fire, you'll be impervious to the UAV. It also helps to have the UAV jammer perk as well, because this will allow you to be totally unknown.;
, Not many people seem to do this. You’re running the same speed as if you were to be standing up, but however, you make no noise when ever you’re crouched. So always, or in most cases, keep your crouch on.
 Snipers are the COD ninjas' one weakness. Snipers can see almost everything, especially when it's moving. So keep an eye out.
 Because whenever a grenade is thrown, if it doesn't at least harm someone, then they'll have an eye out for the direction the explosive came from. So keep the grenades pinned unless absolutely necessary.
 You'll have to have some patience. Usually people who stealth, have to camp in places for quite a while. Sometimes up to 5 minutes. So make sure your patient whenever sneaking around a map.
 Any person in the game isn't good to be around you. Let alone an enemy soldier. So if one of your teammates is sticking around you, be sure to get away from all notations of life. The worst thing is to have a crowd around you whenever you’re attempting to stealth to the enemy's side of the map.
 If you've done all of this correctly then you should still be alive, or at least with a low number of deaths. Congratulations.

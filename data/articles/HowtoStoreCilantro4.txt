 Use sharp, clean kitchen scissors to trim away no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the bottom end of the each cilantro sprig. Also cut away any leaves that have already yellowed or dried.


You could also use a sharp kitchen knife instead of a pair of scissors.






This is not absolutely essential when drying herbs. Since the herb will dry out, anyway, you do not need to expose a fresh end first. By doing this, however, you preserve as much flavor as possible. The end and leaves that have already dried on their own will have far less flavor and will not be worth storing alongside properly dried portions of the sprig.
 Gather several sprigs of cilantro into a bunch and wrap a long piece of twine around the bottom of the stems. Tie the twine in place.


You should usually bundle about four to six springs at once.






Wrap the twine around all the stems several times and knot the twine firmly in place. The twine should be positioned roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom of the stems.



Keep the cilantro in a warm, draft-free area as it dries.






Keep the cilantro out of direct sunlight as you dry it. Sun will cause the leaves to discolor.






If necessary, place a paper bag over the cilantro to protect it from sunlight and drafts. Poke holes in the paper bag to improve airflow and prevent mold from growing.






The cilantro should dry completely in about two weeks. Check the bunches every day or two to make sure that the twine has not loosened too much.
 After the cilantro dries, you can store it for at least half a year.


For best results, keep the dried herbs in airtight containers or resealable plastic bags.






Label each container with the name of the herb and the date you started storing it.

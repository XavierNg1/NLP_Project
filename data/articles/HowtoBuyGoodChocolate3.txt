 Both of these types of establishments will focus on selling exclusively high-quality dark (and possibly milk) chocolate. The owners or managers will know a great deal about where their beans are sourced, how the chocolate is produced, and what ingredients it contains. Often these shops are locally owned and operated, so you’re unlikely to find a chocolatier chain.Gourmet food stores likely import their chocolate from around the world, giving you access to a huge variety of high-quality products. Check out Cost Plus World Market, if there’s one in your area.
 Natural-foods or health-foods stores are more likely to stock high-quality, high-cacao, non-Dutched chocolates.The majority of these chocolates will probably be sold as individually packaged bars which have been made with fair-trade ingredients. Check out stores like Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, Vitamin Cottage, or Wild Oats.

Your local supermarket, on the other hand, will stock primarily mass-produced, low quality chocolate in all varieties.
However, some supermarket chains are stocking more natural, high-quality foods—chocolate included. If your grocery store has a “natural” section, look for good chocolates here.
 If you’re a more experienced chocolate shopper and you have an idea of what you’d like to try—or if you’re starting out and want to sample a dozen different brands of dark chocolate—special ordering may be your best option.Most supermarkets and natural-foods stores will be happy to accommodate your requests.

You can also find a great deal of good chocolate vendors online. Check online stores like Worldwide Chocolate, Chocosphere, or even Amazon.

 It is important to replace your razors regularly. Old razors can accumulate hair, dead skin cells, and leftover shaving cream. This can introduce bacteria to your skin, potentially causing an infection if you cut or nick your skin. Old razors also become duller with use., You will get a closer, smoother shave if your skin is softened by warm water. You should aim for a minimum of ten minutes in a warm bath or shower. Once you’ve been in for at least that amount of time, you can begin shaving., If you bathe or shower in really hot water, your skin will get too soft. This can make your legs more prone to nicks and cuts. If you like a really hot shower, be sure to turn the temperature down before shaving. Aim for warm, but not hot water., You should never shave your legs dry, or shave your legs using bar soap. Bar soap does not create enough lubrication for the razor to slide easily over the surface of your skin, and this can create cuts and nicks. Instead, opt for a moisturizing shave cream or gel.If you’re in a hurry, you can try using hair conditioner instead of shaving cream or gel.
 Your first pass on each leg should be downward, in the direction that your hair grows. Once you shave in the direction of hair growth, you can do an additional pass in an upward direction. If you have sensitive skin you should avoid shaving upward altogether, as it increases your odds getting nicks, cuts, and skin irritation.

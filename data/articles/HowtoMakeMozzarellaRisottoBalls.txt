 In a saucepan, combine the water and the chicken stock and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, move the saucepan to the back of the stove and maintain it at a simmer.;
, Place the frying pan on the heat, add the oil, onion, rice and stir well. Pour in the white wine and continue stirring. When the wine evaporates start adding the stock. First put in 3 ladles and cook while stirring almost continually. When the rice has absorbed most of the stock, add another couple of ladles and stir again. Season with salt and pepper. Keep on adding the stock until the rice is completely cooked.


You will need to stir most of the time to stop the rice from sticking to the pan. When the rice is cooked and of a creamy consistency, stir in the parmesan and thyme and remove from the heat.
 Spoon the risotto into a bowl, directly cover it with cling film and put it in the fridge to cool down.
 Take a small lump of the risotto and begin to form a ball then make a hole in the centre, insert a cube of mozzarella and mould it into a ball. Repeat the same thing until you have the used up the risotto.
 Have the flour, egg and bread crumbs ready in 3 separate bowls. Season the flour with salt and pepper and stir. Take a risotto ball and dip it in the flour, then in the egg and finally in the bread crumbs. Repeat until all the risotto balls are breaded.
 Heat the vegetable oil in a saucepan. When fairly hot, but not smoking, carefully add a few of the risotto balls. It's important that the oil you use isn't too hot as this would only brown the outside. Fry for just a minute and remove them from the heat. Place them onto a tray covered in kitchen paper to drain any excess oil. Repeat the same process until you have fried them all.
 Allow the risotto balls to cool down slightly before serving as they will be baking hot inside.

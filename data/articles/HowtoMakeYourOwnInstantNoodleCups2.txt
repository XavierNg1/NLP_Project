 Evenly distribute the chicken stock base, brown sugar, red curry paste, chili-garlic sauce, fish sauce, cooked shrimp, shiitake mushrooms, coconut milk, and pre-cooked ramen noodles or spaghetti between 4 resealable, heat-safe pint size (473 ml) glass jars. There’s no need to mix the ingredients.You can find red curry paste in the Asian section of many grocery stores.
You can substitute button mushrooms for the shiitake if you prefer.
 Divide 1 cup (100 g) of thinly sliced scallions and 1 lime that’s been cut into wedges between 4 resealable plastic zipper bags. Fold them up and place them at the top of the jars.Keeping the scallions and lime separate from the other ingredients allows you to stir them into the noodles just before you eat for the freshest flavor.
 After all of the ingredients are in the jars, seal them closed with their lids. Place the jars in the refrigerator until you are ready to eat them.The noodles will keep for up to 4 days in your refrigerator.
If you’re traveling with the noodles, you should add a cold pack or frozen bottle of water to your bag to keep them cold.
 When you’re ready to eat your noodles, remove the lid from the jar. Lift the plastic bag with the scallions and lime out, and pour in enough boiling water to reach the top of the jar. Replace the lid, and allow the noodles to sit for at least 2 minutes., After you’ve allowed the noodles to step for a couple of minutes, remove the lid from the jar. Stir in the scallions, and squeeze the lime over the noodles before you begin to eat.You can eat the noodles directly out of the jar or pour them into a bowl to eat.

, Stir them around in the butter and garlic with a spoon. Let the vegetables cook for three to five minutes until they become soft., Crumble the stock cube and pour it into the pot with the tomatoes and the oregano. Then, let the soup simmer on the stove for around 20 minutes.

After 20 minutes, stir in the creme fraiche with a spoon.
 Take the soup off the stove. Then, use an immersion blender to blend the soup together so it is smooth. You can also pour the soup into a blender in batches and blend it up. Do this with care as the soup will be hot.

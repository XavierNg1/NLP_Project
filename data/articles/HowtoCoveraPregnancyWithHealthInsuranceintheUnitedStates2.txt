 There are two ways to sign up for Medicaid, a program providing health care to certain low-income people. You can go to healthcare.gov, where they will screen you and then refer you to your state’s Medicaid office, or you can go directly to your state’s Medicaid office and apply. Since the states set eligibility requirements for Medicaid themselves, they must make the final determination.In states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, everyone who makes 138% of the poverty level qualifies for Medicaid. States which haven’t expanded Medicaid are much more restrictive in who they cover, but low income pregnant women are covered everywhere—and don’t have to pay deductibles or copays for pregnancy related services.
 Your Medicaid application will ask you information about your gender, household size, income, and expenses for items like rent. While you will generally be asked to provide proof of income, you might be able to sign an affidavit affirming you lack of income; a person with no income isn’t getting a paystub, after all.


In some states, you’ll get a decision immediately. In other states, they may call to verify information, but pregnant women usually get quicker service. In any case, once you’re approved, you’re approved. You’ll get a card, but you’ll be covered before it arrives.
 Your state’s Medicaid office will have a listing of doctors who accept Medicaid, and some services, like ZocDoc.com, may have their own lists. The states’ list will be the most complete, however. Find a doctor who’s close to you and make an appointment.

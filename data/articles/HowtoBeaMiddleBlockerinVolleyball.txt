 A middle blocker needs to be built for speed since you take off in either direction to block a hitter. You have one of the most important positions on the team! It's one of the most demanding positions in terms of the cardiovascular system.;
, This means that you can jump high; you can achieve this by working out with plyometrics or "strength" training. It helps to be tall and have long arms.
 The strength of a middle blocker is not usually power, but speed. Almost all of the sets that middle gets are either immediately above the net or about a foot above. This means that you have about a second to get to the ball before it drops below the net. So, if you haven't decided what you are going to do then you will miss your chance.
 YOU own the net. Any ball that gets near the net, try to wrap your hands around it. Call out opposing hitters, call stacked plays, be the first to cheer your teammates as you are usually a part of every play and your intensity will inspire your team. Know where you will be needed most according to the opposition's line-up. Know where their key hitters are and shut them down.
 Since your sets are typically faster, with less reaction time, it is essential for the setter and MB to be on the same page. Repeatedly practice with your setter from a variety of angles, making you more of a target during plays that would typically omit you from the play, i.e. bad pass, no approach.

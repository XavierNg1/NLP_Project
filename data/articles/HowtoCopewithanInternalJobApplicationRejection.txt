 The fact that you took the initiative to apply says a lot about your personality and interests. It tells management that you are a keen and loyal worker who has ambitions to go places within the company or organization.;
, It is very difficult to assess internal applicants, especially when several apply for the same position, and the choice and ranking has to come down to some pretty objective criteria. Such criteria are likely to include level and time of experience, specific knowledge of issues or subject-matter and training background. This does not mean that they think you will never make a suitable fit in that role and it certainly does not mean that they think you are unsuitable in your current role.
 You are entitled to ask what factors swayed them against choosing you and how you can better your chances next time. You have already created an invisible link with future possibilities by showing your hand this time round and management will remember this enthusiasm and potential for future appointments, or even for interim projects on which you might be able to learn necessary skills. The current application will have helped, not hindered, your future prospects.
 Your reaction will be observed and commented on. Make sure your reaction is a good one, a reasoned one and one that says "OK, I'm still good for this place and it's good for me." A good sport continues to be viewed as a good team player worth near future consideration. Be graceful and it will be duly noted.
 Ask for training, for courses, for mentoring as needed. Improve the relevant knowledge and abilities that you have found out need improvement. Your enthusiasm will continue to impress and your obvious increased knowledge will set you in better stead next time.

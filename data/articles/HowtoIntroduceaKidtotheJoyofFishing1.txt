 Many state departments of natural resources or conservation put on kids' fishing events to teach both children and their parents about fishing. These events are held at various locations around the state, feature trained instructors, and usually provide equipment for children to use during their outing. Some events are held in conjunction with free fishing days or weekends, when the state suspends its requirement that fishermen purchase licenses in order to fish. You can find out specific times and places of these events by visiting the website of your state department of conservation or natural resources; some may sponsor special websites devoted to fishing.


Kids' fishing events may also be sponsored by private outdoor organizations, youth groups, city police departments, or other organizations. In some cases, the purpose is more than simply introducing children to the joy of fishing, such as building goodwill in the community, but these events feature many of the same activities as fishing events sponsored by state conservation departments.;
, Many outdoor exhibition shows include either tanks that show fish in miniature representations of their aquatic environments or stocked artificial ponds at which the attendees can fish for a small fee in addition to the show's admission fee. These events provide each angler with his or her own rod, usually of the same type and usually all having the same bait or lure.
 Some state conservation departments maintain exhibit aquariums of some of their game fish species or offer tours of their hatcheries to show anglers and their families how those fish are raised. Although there are no actual fishing opportunities associated with these tours, they can provide opportunities for learning about fish habits and habitats ï¿½ and the excitement of seeing fish boil the surface to compete for morsels of food thrown to them.
 If you regularly go fishing and have a child eager to tag along with you, this is an excellent opportunity to introduce that child to the joy of fishing. You'll want to take the child's age, ability, interests, and attention span into account in choosing an appropriate place to go fishing and the amount of time to spend. Generally, early trips should be fairly short and gradually get longer as the child's interest and abilities expand. You can also expect to handle such chores as baiting the hook and taking the fish off it when the child is particularly young.


Go fishing for species that will provide your child with sufficient excitement without being unduly challenging. Species such as bluegill, black or white crappie, sunfish, perch, and bullhead catfish will all provide a young child with an entertaining experience when they take the bait and the hook is set.
You may want to take your child to either a public or private lake that is regularly restocked with fish. Fishing at these lakes usually costs a daily-use fee in addition to the cost of your fishing license and any park fees, but the increased opportunity to catch that first fish may be worth the added cost.

 Use only organic, untreated seeds when growing sprouts. Many seeds sold for planting are treated with insecticides or fungicides. You need 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of seeds for each 5 square inches (13 cm^2) of container space.;
, Clear plastic containers with clear lids, such as those used for sprouts, berries and other produce at the store, work great for growing sprouts. You can use plastic wrap to cover containers that do not have a clear lid.


The size of the container doesn't really matter as long as it is at least 4 inches (10 cm) deep.
If you want to grow your sprouts in soil, the container must have drainage.
 Fill a bucket with a solution of 9 parts lukewarm water and 1 part household bleach. Soak the containers and the seeds in the water for 20 minutes. Alternatively, you can disinfect only the containers with the bleach solution.
 Some growers have reported higher germination rates from seeds given the longer soak without the bleach.
 Place the seeds in a tea strainer to rinse them.

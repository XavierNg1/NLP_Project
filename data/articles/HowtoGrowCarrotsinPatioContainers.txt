Any variety of carrot seeds will suffice.;

The container should be at least 12 inches (30.48 cm) deep to contain the carrots at their full length.
The container should have a width of at least 18-to-24 inches (45.72-to-60.96 cm) to allow ample room for planting the seeds.
Any type of container will suffice as long as it has drainage.



This should include potting soil, compost and sand.
Buy enough of each to make a mixture of 60 percent potting soil, 20 percent compost and 20 percent sand for each container.

If you are unsure when to plant the seeds, ask a fellow gardener or contact your local garden supply store for this information. It should also be available on the Internet.
In general, you should wait until the nighttime temperatures in your area consistently remain at more than 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.78 degrees Celsius).

Space the carrot seeds 2-to-3 inches (5.08-to-7.62 cm) apart and 1/4 inch (1.27 cm) deep. Use a garden shovel to dig these small holes, if necessary.
Cover the seeds with a loose layer of potting soil. It is important not to pack the soil, as doing so may make it difficult for the carrots to grow.



Add a shovelful of compost to a bucket and fill the rest with water.
Allow the mixture to sit overnight.
Separate the compost from the water. Retain the water as your liquid fertilizer.

The soil should never dry out.

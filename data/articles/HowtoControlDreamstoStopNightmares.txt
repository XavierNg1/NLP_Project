 This might sound awkward and looking like a detour but the idea is to increase your awareness during the day so that you're much more likely to recognize a nightmare when it’s coming.;
, and blink hard, while imagining yourself lying in bed. Although you're not going to solve your nightmares for goods, this can quickly end a terrifying dream.
 Although sounds silly, this is a very reliable technique to change surroundings. In fact, if you focus on changing the setting into something else while spinning, most likely you’ll find out that the setting has changed into your desired surroundings after you stopped spinning. Another good way to change the setting (and "escape" from the nightmare) is using dream doors or portals - you just open a dream door and step through it, imagining first where would you like to be teleported.
 It is the only real element of your bad dream; all the rest (like danger, monsters etc.) are not. You can do it by challenging the threat (“come and get me”). Bad guys often transform into harmless creatures when courageously confronted in lucid dreams. Come to your demon and ask what he wants. In case of recurring nightmares, you will very likely put an end to your suffering.

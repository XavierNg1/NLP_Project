 Mobs won't spawn when the light level is higher than 7, so place torches, Jack-o-Lanterns, or glowstone blocks in, on, and around your house.
 The wall must be at least three blocks high with one block overhang, a fence must be at least two blocks high with one block overhang. Don't forget to place torches on the wall, so mobs don't spawn on top of it.

Cobblestone is the best material for the wall, aside from obsidian, since it has a high blast-resistance.
 The moment you can use a bed, use it. Skipping the night won't give monsters a chance to spawn., Though they are a bit more expensive than wooden doors, zombies can't break them, and if you happen to live in a village, villagers won't be able to enter your house either.

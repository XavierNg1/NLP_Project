 Mix these in an electric mixer or by hand until smooth. If whisking by hand, let the butter soften at room temperature first. Cutting the butter into small pieces will speed this up greatly.
 Pour in the sugar while whisking at low speed. Keep whisking until smooth.
 Blend strawberries or your favorite fruit in a food processor. Drain off the juice and measure the solid fruit. This recipe can take up to Â½ cup (120 mL) of blended fruit. You may want to add this bit by bit, as the icing can easily get soupy.You can use fruit preserves instead, for a sweeter taste and less liquid.
 The icing should last in the fridge for several days. If you make this in advance, you may need to beat it again to make it lighter before spreading on cupcakes.

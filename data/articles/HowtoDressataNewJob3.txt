 A little color is appropriate here, but avoid anything too bright or flashy. Polo-style shirts and knit pullover sweaters are also appropriate.
 Your khakis should be high quality, and you must keep them pressed and wrinkle-free. Microfiber and gabardine pants also work well.
 Oxfords and other dressy lace-up shoes are not necessary here, but your shoes should still be in good shape. You should still avoid sneakers, which are too casual for mainstream business casual.
 Black socks still look best if you plan on wearing black shoes, but other colors, like tan or brown, may coordinate better with light khaki pants and brown shoes. White socks generally look out of place, however.
 At this point, ties are mostly optional. You may also be able to get away with a brighter, bolder pattern, but you should skip anything that looks questionable.
 These, too, are also optional. If you decide to wear some type of outerwear, a blazer is a little more casual and a better fit for business casual than a traditional wool suit jacket.

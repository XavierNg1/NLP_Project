 Even if we are planning to do or say something, your brain is capable of canceling the action in the quarter of a second before the action happens. You can take advantage of your brain’s natural ability to cancel words and actions by getting into the habit of pausing before you say anything. If you are about to swear, then you have the option to cancel that action., If a swear word starts slips out, you can cover it up by adding on an additional word or syllable, thus turning it into an acceptable expression. For example, try turning “Sh__” into “Shiitake Mushrooms” (pronounced shi-TAH-kay mushrooms). This can be helpful if you swear without meaning to and you need to cover it up in a hurry.Doing this is kind of funny, and it might make parents laugh instead of getting mad at you.
If you can’t think of a way to disguise a swear word, then try clapping your hands or making another loud noise at the same time.
 When you feel like you need to swear, you may find it helpful to use use milder words to satisfy your urge. For example, you can say things like, “Fudge,” “Heck,” "Sugar," or “Frick.”, Some people swear as part of their regular vocabulary, which can make it hard to stop. If swearing is a staple in your vocabulary, then try learning a new word each day and see how many times you can use it.


For example, you might learn the word “antediluvian,” which means that something is out of date or old-fashioned.Then if you became frustrated with your computer, you could say something like, “I hate this antediluvian computer!”

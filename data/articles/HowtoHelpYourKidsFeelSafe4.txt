 You can’t prevent some things that may threaten your kids’ safety from happening, but you can handle the situation appropriately so that you and your kids stay as safe as possible. One of the main things you can do during a difficult situation to help you all stay safe and feel safe is to stay calm.Kids often take their cues from adults, so if you’re calm, it may help calm them which can help you all do what you need to do to stay safe.


Take a few deep breaths to calm and center yourself. Inhale through your nose slowly and then exhale slowly through your mouth a few times.
Try to become aware of any tension in your body — unclench your hands and jaw, relax your shoulders, and so on.
Remind yourself and your kids that everything is going to be okay. You might say, “Stay calm, everyone. We’re going to be okay.”

, If you have a plan in place for the situation, then use it. Referring to your plan will help you and your kids stay safe and feel safe because you already know what you need to do. This can help make the situation less frightening and stressful.


For instance, if you all hear the hurricane siren you could say, “Alright, kids, time for Hurricane Plan. Let’s get to it.”
If it helps, quickly run through the steps together. For example, you might say, “Remember, go to the safe place, get down, cover up, and wait.”

, Professionals are trained and have the experience to help you handle a lot of different situations. They also have several different techniques and strategies to help you stay safe and feel safe. Talk to the appropriate person if an emergency or difficult situation arises.If anyone is injured or in eminent danger you should contact help immediately by dialing 911.
For example, if someone tries to approach your kids aggressively you would report it to your local police.
Or, for instance, if there was a natural disaster, you might contact your local Emergency Management Agency or other community organization.

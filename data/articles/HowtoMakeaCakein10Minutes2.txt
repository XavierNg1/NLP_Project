 This cake requires a few more ingredients, but it's worth the effort if you have a taste for something fruity.The strawberry flavor comes from yogurt; if you don't have strawberry yogurt on hand, you can substitute it with blueberry, raspberry, peach, or any other fruit flavor. Here's what you'll need:


2 tablespoons strawberry or other fruit yogurt
1 egg
1 tablespoon oil (vegetable or grapeseed)
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
4 tablespoons sugar
5 tablespoons flour
Fresh fruit and whipped cream

, Put all of the ingredients except the fresh fruit and whipped cream in a large mug that you have greased with butter or oil. Use a spoon to mix the ingredients until there are no lumps (except those made by the bits of fruit).
 Place the mug in the microwave and cook it on high for 1 1/2 minutes. Check to make sure the batter isn't overflowing; if it is, let it rest for a minute. Then close the door and microwave for another 1 1/2 minutes.
 Spoon whipped cream over the top of the cake, then add some freshly cut strawberries. Enjoy straight from the mug with a spoon.

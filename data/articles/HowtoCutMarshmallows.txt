 The main problem with marshmallows is their stickiness. Once you start cutting into them, they are going to stick to your fingers and everything else. For a good start, find a non-stick surface to slice them on, such as a plastic cutting board. This is also good to prevent slipping.;
, Slip the knife into cold water before cutting the marshmallows. This will help to reduce the stickiness and should be repeated as you continue to slice the marshmallows. Use the wet knife to quickly slice through the marshmallows.
 Your fingers should now be moist to enable you to handle the marshmallows without sticking. The marshmallows will dry out quickly. Use your damp fingers to move them from the board to wherever you're using them next.
 Or place them in the recipe requiring diced marshmallows, such as rocky road.

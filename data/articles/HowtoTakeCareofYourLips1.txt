 Exfoliating your lips will help to remove dead layers of skin and help generate regrowth of new skin cells.To exfoliate your lips, use an abrasive lip scrub product (for example, a sugar scrub) and gently rub it on your lips. Rub the mixture into your lips, removing any flakey or dead skin. Rinse off the remaining mixture for smoother lips.
You can also try applying petroleum jelly to your lips and exfoliating by massaging them with a damp cloth. Apply the cloth in a gentle, circular motion to remove dead skin.;
, Applying oils to your lips will help to hydrate and maintain moisture.
 Dry air can dry out lips. If you can, use a humidifier in spaces where you spend a lot of time (like a bedroom) to infuse more moisture into the air. This is especially helpful during winter when the air can be more dry.
 The American Academy of Dermatologists suggest that the most common reason for lip eczema is an allergic reaction.This could be from your shampoo, lipstick, face wash, or even toothpaste.


To heal eczema, try removing one product from your routine for about a week. If your lips start to clear up from a removal of a product, you can best guess that was the cause of the irritation.

Adobe InDesign will open an Export PDF window, allowing you to customize several exporting options.



The smallest file size will be easiest to email or upload to the web or a network location.
The Press Quality setting makes the image quality the highest priority and is for documents that will be going to a professional printer. This setting is not compatible with all versions of Adobe Reader or other PDF reading programs.
The High Quality Print setting will create a PDF file that is compatible with all versions of Adobe Reader, but will result in a much larger file size.



All pages selected will export into one multi-page PDF file.
Repeat the printing process to make a separate export PDF file for each page and select a different single page each time.
 You can also mark other options as desired.


If making a PDF for uploading online, check the 'Include Hyperlinks' and 'Optimize for Fast Web View.'

,,, (Make sure you have marked 'View PDF after Exporting' in Step 6.) Review your exported PDF for errors before sharing.

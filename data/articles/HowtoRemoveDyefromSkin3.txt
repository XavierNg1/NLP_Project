 The first step to avoiding dye on your skin is to be prepared before you do a home dye. Buy a pair of latex or plastic gloves to protect your hands. Lay down a plastic sheet or newspaper to protect the surfaces around your dye area, and wear old clothes you wonâ€™t mind staining.After you dye your hair, you should also use a plastic hair cap to protect your hair and avoid getting dye on your skin or your clothing.
 Another great tip is to create a home skin protector around your hairline so the dye cannot be absorbed by your skin.Use products like Vaseline petroleum jelly, an oil based lotion, or even lip balm. Apply the product with your fingers around your hairline, behind your ears, and on the back of your neck so its more difficult for dye to get on your skin in these areas.
 Natural hair dye, like henna, are usually less difficult to remove from your skin than commercial dyes. Most henna stains will dissolve from your skin within 48 hours and do not contain any toxic ingredients that could get into your skin.,

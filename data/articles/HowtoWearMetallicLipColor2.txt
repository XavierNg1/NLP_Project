 Metallic lips are often vibrant. Therefore, they should be the emphasis of your makeup. When choosing eyeshadows, apply something more neutral to avoid distracting from your lips.Colors like beiges, ivories, grays, and browns are great to pair with metallic eye shadow.
 Again, you do not want to overpower your metallic lips with other colors. When applying eyeliner and mascara, stick to the basics.Line your upper lid with a line of eyeliner, sticking to a neutral shade like black or brown. If you want, you can create a slight cat eye by adding small wings of eyeliner to either eye.
Choose a mascara that will make your lashes more noticeable. Apply by placing the eyeliner brush at the roots of the lashes and wiggling it upward to their ends.
 You may want a slightly more dramatic look when using metallic lips. You do not want your eyes to be overpowering. However, a splash of a bright color on your lash line can make your eyes pop a little while still giving the metallic lips the most attention.Try using a bright color, like, turquoise, across your lower lash line. You can also apply a small amount to your water line.
Make sure to blend the color out after applying. Dust some of the same eye shadow you used on your eyelid below your waterline. Then, use a blending brush to mix the colors together slightly. This will prevent your water line and lower lash line from looking too dramatic.
 Light contouring is key when using metallic lips. As your lips should be the center of your look, you do not want to do a heavily contoured face. Stick to highlighting your cheekbones with small lines of bronzer.Add angled lines of bronzer to your cheekbones, following their natural curves. From there, circle your face and forehead in a light layer of bronzer.
Blend the bronzer into your regular foundation. This will create a smooth, slimmed down look for your face.

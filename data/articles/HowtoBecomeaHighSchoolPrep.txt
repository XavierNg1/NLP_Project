 If you're not even close to being a prep right now (i.e. you're labeled as "emo", "scene", "dork/nerd/geek", or even a total loser with no friends, it will take a while for people to accept you as a prep and not your "old self".;
, A reason you might want to become popular is to look better, have more friends, or even if you don't like your current label. If you're changing schools, becoming preppy overnight is a great idea, sure! But if you're seeing the same kids in high school next year, gradually change. If you're already in high school, it's probably best to wait until college.
 Ask the hair stylist for a cute cut with not too many layers. Most preps like their hair to their shoulders. If you like longer hair, get it around two inches past, but don't leave your hair extremely long.
 Use anti-frizz cream, or a shampoo that reduces frizz/static. Then, using a flat iron, straighten your hair, when it is completely dry. It helps to flip your hair upside down & straighten it that way afterwards. Apply a little anti-frizz cream, not TOO much, because then your hair will look oily!

, Just make sure it is not frizzy.
 It's better if you leave it down, but if you feel a bit bored, you could also try a low ponytail or a side braid. DO NOT put your hair in pig tails, two braids or super-high ponytails, because they can make you look childish... not so preppy.
 Think simplicity.
 Not everything goes. If you wear dorky things, you won't become a prep. You must start shopping differently.
 Preps wear simple clothes, like polo shirts, classic jeans(ripped/styled jeans are a major no-no), classic shoes(boat shoes, flats, flip flops, boots, canvas shoes, etc; just remember, simple, classic, cute) tees, sweatshirts, and tank tops(loose ones; preps don't overly show off cleavage!). For summer, get a cute solid bathing suit from anywhere just make sure it's gonna last for awhile. Plaid shorts(Madras and Seersuckers are good ideas as well) and classic tops. Also, jewelry is elegant- wear pearls(true preps wear heirlooms), charm bracelets, cuffs, silver/gold.
 This is where you will meet most of your new friends! Be nice to everyone on the team, and invite some to hang out with you. Take them shopping, and have them help you pick out clothes. Or, hold a slumber party for a few of them ( if they're already friends ). Or have them hang at your house. Sports to considerÂ ; lacrosse, field hockey, swim team, soccer,& softball are just a few. Cheerleading is okay but not always preppy, if your cheer squad is known for being promiscuous, which is totally not preppy.
 I know EVERYONE says this, but don't ditch your old friends. Even if you don't like them anymore. They will spread gossip, which will make you even more hated if you aren't already. Gradually stop hanging out with them. Still be nice to them, even if they aren't. Be a very open, friendly person. Preps don't have a limit on being friends with preps only. If someone has nowhere to sit in lunch, invite them to your table. It will not only make you look like a better person, but this person will also be a little happier.
 Don't overdo it on makeup, though. Look natural and clean.
 Be a friendly person, and smile a lot (but not 24/7...weird!). Don't have a fake laugh, or a rude attitude. Don't talk about your new friends behind your back.

 Begin by dealing 1 card face down to the player to your left and continuing around the table dealing cards 1 at a time until every player has 5 cards.This is a game in which players are dealt a full hand which remains hidden and is improved by replacing cards.
 Mark these with a chip or another item so that they are distinguishable from other cards.
 At this point, players should be holding the cards in their hands, being careful not to show them to other players.
 Players can discard as many cards as they like and replace them by drawing the same number of cards from the deck in the middle of the table. Each player should ultimately have 5 cards.
 If you played blinds, where only the two players to your left paid money before you dealt the cards, betting should begin from the player immediately to your left., This is the showdown. The player with the best 5-card hand wins the pot.

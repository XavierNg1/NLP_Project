 If this is your first use, or if the Smart Board has been recently moved, you will need to do a calibration.


To calibrate the Smart Board, press the keyboard and right mouse button at the same time. An icon will appear in the upper-left area of the screen. Touch this icon with a Smart Board pen or your finger. Repeat every time you see the icon until calibration is complete.;
,


Touch your finger once on the screen to mimic a left mouse click.
Press and hold your finger on a spot on the board for a right mouse click.
Click and drag with your finger to move an object on the screen to another location.
 These come in various colors, but the board will only remember the last color used. Do anything you would normally do on a whiteboard: draw, write or annotate.


To erase items on the smart board, first replace the pens in the tray. Use the board eraser as you would a normal one.
You can clear all the writing at one time by touching the board and selecting "Clear Ink."
You can also draw a circle around the writing with the eraser and tap in the middle of the circle to erase everything.
 Your notes will be saved in the SMART Notebook. Select File and Save to complete the process.


You can also click on the camera which appears in the top right corner.
 Use a soft, clean cloth and do not spray directly on the smart board. Alcohol free wipes may also be used.

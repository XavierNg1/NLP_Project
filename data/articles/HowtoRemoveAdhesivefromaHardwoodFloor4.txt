 You are going to need gloves, protective eyewear, a metal cookie sheet or tray, and a ½ lb (227-gram) block of dry ice. Dry ice can be purchased at many grocery stores, as well as some hardware stores., As with the commercial adhesive remover, dry ice is quite powerful. It is necessary for you to protect your hands and eyes by wearing rubber gloves and protective eyewear whenever you handle dry ice., Using a gloved hand, center your ½ lb block of dry ice on a metal cookie sheet. The cookie sheet should be large enough to cover the area where you’d like to remove the adhesive. If it is not, you can always repeat this process., The dry ice will harden and then crack the adhesive. This is perhaps the quickest and cleanest method of loosening and removing floor adhesive., As always, use gentle pressure and soft motions, as you do not want to damage your floor.

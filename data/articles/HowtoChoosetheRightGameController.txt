How many buttons do i really need?
Which controller has the the best handling(for me)?
Which controller do i usually use for other games?
Would it hurt my moneybag if the controller gets broken?
Is this type of controller still sold in stores?

, The last question could be one of the most important. If you answer the question with 'no' but you answered all other questions with the better answer in your opinion you maybe should think about it once again. Once you get used to using a controller with a special game and the controller gets broken, you won't have a chance to get the same and would have to get used to a new one.

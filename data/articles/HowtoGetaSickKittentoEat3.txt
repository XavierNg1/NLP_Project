 Aside from eating, there several signs that your kitten is depressed. These include a lack of energy and sleeping more than usual, loss of interest in her regular activities, becoming reclusive, or showing aggressive behavior.
 The most common reason that kittens become depressed is because they are not shown enough attention. To combat your kitten’s depression and get her to start eating again, play with her and show her love as much as you can. Hold her while you are working or watching a movie, play with her in the mornings and afternoons, and praise her with treats and affection.
 You can’t always be home to play with your kitten. Invest in some toys that will keep your kitten entertained while you are away. Climbing trees, toys, scratching posts, and food puzzles are all great ways to keep your kitten entertained while you are away.Consider getting your kitten a friend. If you can afford to do so, you may want to bring another kitten into your home so that each kitten will have someone else to play with; however, it's important to keep in mind that integrating a new kitten can get harder as your original kitten gets older.
 If you pay a lot of attention to your kitten and are constantly showing her love, she is probably not depressed because you don’t play with her. Instead, she is probably depressed because she is in pain in some way, either through sickness or because she got hurt. If you can’t seem to figure out what is ailing your kitten, take her to the vet.


Kittens should be playful and alert. The most likely reason for a kitten to be depressed is immediately after homing. If you have owned the kitten for a while and she is quiet, then it's more likely there is a health problem.

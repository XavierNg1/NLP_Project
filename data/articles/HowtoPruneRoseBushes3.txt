 These are the black, shriveled stalks that will no longer produce new growth. The healthy canes are green or brown and firm. Use your pruning shears to cut them as close to the base as possible. If you find a cane that looks like it's still partially alive, make a cut 1/4 ich above one of the bud eyes.
 These are the new plant shoots sprouting from the ground right next to the older rosebush. They're called "suckers" because they suck away the nutrients from the older bush, causing its health to fail.









Prune the suckers from their bases, rather than just chopping them down; they'll just grow back stronger if you do it that way.
You might have to push back the soil a bit to get the sucker at its root.
 Canes that are very thin and look to be weak, or canes that are crossed toward the center of the bush, should be pruned at the base as well. These impair the bush's health by getting in the way of good air circulation, and they also make the bush look wild and unkempt.
 Keeping in mind that new branches sprout from the bud eyes, prune the remaining canes to achieve the desired rosebush shape. Prune 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) above outward facing bud eyes, so the new branches will grow outward. Decide how high or low you want to keep the bush, and prune accordingly.
 As the growing season moves along, the bush will produce blossoms that eventually fade. Removing these is called deadheading, and is healthy for the rosebush. The energy that went toward the fading blossom will be redirected to produce a new one. Cut the spent bloom off just above the first five leaf cluster.

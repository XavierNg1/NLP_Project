 (454 g) of Dead Sea salts into a large bowl.
 (14.8 ml) of carrier oil into a measuring spoon. Mix it into your bath salts with a large spoon.
 Start with 2 drops and add as many as 10.
 Add 1/16 to 1/8 tsp. (0.125 to 0.25 g) of mica powder to the recipe. Mix well.


You can also use an FD&C, adding 1 drop at a time until you reach your desired color.
 Use the entire lb. of sea salts at once to create a high salinity bath, with benefits similar to those of the Dead Sea.

 When in public, talk to every single person you see. Say hello in another language. Compliment them. Or if they look at you funny, ask them if they need something. Be tough to the rude people and polite to the nice ones. If you see a tough person, just smile sweetly. If you see a good-looking person, let them know that they're good-looking.;
, Don't feel the need to follow the rules of fashionâ€”wear whatever you like! Cultivate your own personal style, no matter how unconventional or silly it is.
 Kindness is what separates the lovable weird people from the unsettling ones. Don't hesitate to help a person in need, whether a friend or a stranger.
 Make funny faces, kiss people's hands, and speak your mind (nicely, of course). Be as spontaneous and lighthearted as you wish.
 Let loose and have fun with it. Sing along (even if you don't know the words). Grab hands with a friend and start spinning in circles (but only if they're having fun).
 Use gestures and tone of voice to add to your meaning. When you're telling a story, use different voices and many interesting/goofy facial expressions. Make big motions with your hands, exaggerate a little (or a lot).
 It helps to have a group of likeminded friends who like you for who you are. Allow yourselves to be silly together and enjoy life.
 Not everyone will like you, and not everyone will want to hang out with you. This is okay. It's more important that you do what you love and be authentically kind. Focus on the bright side and be yourself.

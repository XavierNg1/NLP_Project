 Don’t squat, but keep a significant bend in your knees. Keep your hips very loose.









You should be bending enough for a noticeable change in your height, but not so much that you are using a lot of thigh strength to keep yourself in position.
 Relax your left hip down. Then repeat on the other side.









Your head should be completely level. It may move side to side, but never up and down. Concentrate all of your movement on the shifting weight in your legs, and the swaying of your hips.
Once you are ready, lift your feet every time the weight shifts off of them.
 Traditionally, the position for the kao step is to keep both of your hands at chest height, palms towards the ground and fingertips facing each other.


Keep your elbows at shoulder height, don’t let them droop!

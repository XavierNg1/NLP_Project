After clicking on the Bluetooth option, your Windows 8.1 operating system will display the device after a brief period.
After being detected, the laptop or tablet will display a notification detailing that the mouse is ready to pair.
 During the pairing process, there are two things that can happen:


If the Windows 8.1 operating system has the drivers for your Bluetooth mouse, then these drivers will be installed automatically.
If the drivers are not available, the operating system will access the Internet to download them.
After the process has been completed and the drivers have been installed successfully, Windows 8.1 will display the product name of your Bluetooth mouse, indicating that the mouse has been connected.
 When you no longer need to use the Bluetooth mouse, just switch off the power using the power switch underneath the device.


Switching off the mouse when not in use will help conserve its batteries.

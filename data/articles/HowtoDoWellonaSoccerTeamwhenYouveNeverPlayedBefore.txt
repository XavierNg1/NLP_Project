, Make sure your kicks are not too hard, and that the ball does not get too far away from you. The key here is control! Try to get to a point where you no longer have to look down at the ball or your feet to be in control

, Kick the ball to a wall or partner (about 6-10 feet away). The non-kicking foot should end right next to the ball. the ball should get to the wall with good speed and on the ground. If the ball is coming off the ground it's because you are leaning back or not bending your leg. Do not pass with your toes!

, Run up to it and kick with the inside, outside or laces, as hard as possible (while still in control) Make sure your body is over the ball when you shoot, or the ball will go over the goal.
 Both feet (any part of them) must remain on the ground at all times while doing a throw in.
, Make sure to let your teammates know when you are leaving your man.

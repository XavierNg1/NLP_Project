 While some individuals may insist that sexual orientation can be changed, virtually all major mental health organizations have released statements asserting that this is not the case, and cautioning against treatments that purport to “convert” LGBT people.Some states have even banned gay “conversion therapy” in response to scientific evidence suggesting such therapy may actually be damaging or abusive., Even among the ex-gay community, few believe complete conversion is possible. Many ex-gay organizations have shut down in recent years, and admitted that they could not “cure” gay people.There is no meaningful scientific evidence that people who are not attracted to the opposite sex can be converted to heterosexuality. On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence that attempts to change a person’s sexual orientation can have a profoundly damaging impact., While life has improved greatly for LGBT Americans over the last couple decades, many gay and lesbian people suffer greatly because of their sexual orientation. About 40% of homeless youth are LGBT-identified, and 68% of those reported family rejection as a major factor.LGBT youth are 4 times more likely than heterosexual youth to attempt suicide.They also experience higher levels of bullying, substance abuse, and sexual assault.There are many countries where gay ove is illegal, or even punishable by death.Bearing all this in mind, ask yourself, “Why would these people chose to be LGBT?”

 To do this, slice your ripe heirloom tomato in half with a knife.
 You'll get both the seeds and the gel surrounding the seeds.
 You don't need to separate the seeds from the gel, as this will happen naturally later on in the fermentation process.
 This is especially important if you are saving different types of seeds.
 The amount of water you use doesnâ€™t matter as long as the seeds are covered; the mixture can even be soupy.
 Make sure to leave enough room so that air can get to the seeds. The air transpiration encourages seed fermentation.


If you use plastic wrap for a cover, be sure to poke a few holes in it.
 If possible, choose an indoor location instead of an outdoor one so nothing can interfere with the fermentation process.
 After you're done, replace the covering.
 This could take up to four days or until a film forms on top of the water and most of the seeds have sunk to the bottom of the container. Any seeds that are still floating on top of the water are not useable.

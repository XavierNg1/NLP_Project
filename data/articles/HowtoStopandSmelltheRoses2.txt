 Put away your cell phone, tablet, laptop, and other devices that distract. Be present in the moment with the people around you. It's easier now to multi-task with modern technology, but it often lessens the experience of "being in the moment."


Be open to listening to those around you by taking the time to really hear what they are saying. Notice their body language, and tune-in to their actions.
 Share in activities with others that bring joy. Make the everyday experiences more memorable by sharing them together. Going to the grocery store can be an adventure. Making dinner together can be rewarding.


Humor can make ordinary things seem fun.
 No matter if you are just starting out in a relationship, or have been married for 30 years, it's important to show that you care about your partner even after all these years. Make a special meal for your partner. Be creative. Putting in effort that goes beyond the usual routine is often rewarding for both of you.
Give a small gift to show your love. Whether it's a single rose, a handmade craft, or a card, it makes a world of difference to show you care. Small surprises can become lasting memories and help to build stronger relationships.
 As you become more busy, you may start to be in a sort of "bubble" of school, work, and home, wherein you forget that there are lots of other people going through stressful times like you. So while you're rushing to get from Point A to Point B, stop for a minute and look at the people around you. There might be someone in need, or who is feeling down. Be kind to them, even in the smallest of ways.


Sometimes the smallest gesture of kindness can change someone's outlook on their day, their week, their year, or their life.

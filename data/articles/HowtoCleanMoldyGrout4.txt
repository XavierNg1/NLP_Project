 Mold is typically created when there is a leak in your showerhead which can cause continual moisture in your tub. Locate where the mold is growing and fix the source of the moisture to prevent it from happening in the future., Wiping down your shower after you use it will soak up the moisture that encourages mold growth. The more diligent you are keeping the area dry, the less chance mold will form., If you have cement based grout, resealing it every 3-5 years can help close up the pores in the grout and prevent mold growth in the future. Apply the sealer to clean grout and wipe up any excess that spills onto your tiles. Allow the grout to dry for at least 3 hours before using your shower or bath again.Do not seal epoxy, urethane and other types of synthetic grout.
 Whenever you take a shower or bath, make sure to turn on the bathroom fan and open up a window to reduce the amount of humidity in your bathroom. Having a steamy bathroom accelerates bacterial growth and will result in more mold.

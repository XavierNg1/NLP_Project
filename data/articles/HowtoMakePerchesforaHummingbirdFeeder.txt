 Remove the base from the reservoir and place the base on your work surface.;
, Measure around the point where the reservoir attaches to the feeder plus 1" (2.5cm).
 Bend the last 1/2" of each end of this wire into a little hook. Bend the wire into a circle and hook the ends together. Bend the wire a little more if necessary to make it round. Fit it over the feeder base. It should be a loose fit.
 Measure the circumference of a circle about 1" larger than the circumference of the feeder base. Cut a length of the heavy-gauge coated wire equal to this length plus 1".
 Bend the last 1/2" of each end of this wire into a little hook. Bend the wire into a circle and hook the ends together. Bend the wire a little more if necessary to make it round. Lay it around the feeder base.
 Measure the distance between the two round wires. Cut connector wires equal to this length plus 1". The number of connector wires you'll need is equal to the number of feeder holes in the base.
 Bend the last 1/2" of each end of each connector wire into a little hook. Hook each onto the anchor wire with the hook facing upward spacing them so that the connectors are between the feeder holes. Put the perch wire into the hooks at the other end of each connector wire. You will likely have to "play" with bending the various wires to get everything to fit together.
 Once you're satisfied with the arrangement, use the pliers to clamp down all the connector wire hooks. The whole thing should look like two wheels connected by spokes. It should be rigid enough that if you pick it up, the various parts don't rearrange themselves.
 Fill the feeder with hummingbird food, and hang it where you can see it.

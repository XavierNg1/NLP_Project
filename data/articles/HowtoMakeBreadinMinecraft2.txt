 You can find Wheat in chests scattered throughout the world. You can also harvest Wheat grown by villagers, and a single Hay Bale block can be turned into nine Wheats.
 You'll need to use the Crafting Table in order to create Bread. You can make a Crafting Table out of four Wood Planks.
 You can place them in any row, as long as they are all in the same row., You'll now have a single loaf of Bread. If you equip and eat it, you'll regain 5 Hunger (about 3 Shanks on your screen).

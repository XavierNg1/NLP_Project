 When you get diagnosed with MS, it is your decision to share the details of your condition with your employer. There are laws that protect you and your job, but some people may be afraid that sharing their diagnosis may unfairly stigmatize them in the workplace.You may choose to wait until you experience symptoms that affect your work to disclose the information. For example, you may tell your boss when your symptoms affect your work or you have trouble completing your work at the same pace due to fatigue.
 There are different accommodations you can request to help you complete your job effectively with MS. Decide what accommodations would help you. Then, start researching what will have to be purchased or changed to meet these accommodations.Some accommodations may be costly. Figure out if certain accommodations, like software for you to talk into the computer instead of type, will cost the company large amounts of money.
Talk to the multiple sclerosis societies in your areas. They can help you find ways to adapt your workplace efficiently so you can do your job. State or local offices of vocational rehabilitation may also be able to help you figure out ways to make accommodations at work.
 When you are ready, have a conversation with your boss. Remember, you should approach this as a discussion and not walk in making demands. Approach your boss with examples of how MS affects your work, along with solutions for how to make your work more efficient with your MS.Be open to suggestions from your boss. However, if they do not understand your limitations, make sure to remind them of what you are able to do.
Examples of accommodations may be flexible work schedules where you work shorter hours or do work from home when you deal with fatigue or other symptoms. You may be able to work in a room that is kept at a cooler temperature so as not to trigger your heat sensitivity.

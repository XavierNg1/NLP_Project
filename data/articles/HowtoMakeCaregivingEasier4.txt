 It is important to take care of yourself. Although caregiving can be a big responsibility, make sure that you are getting enough sleep and rest. Maintain your social life, and make sure that you still participate in your favorite activities. This will reduce stress, depression, and fatigue.While you may feel guilty for going out and socializing as a caregiver, it is important not to isolate yourself. Taking short breaks will benefit both you and the care recipient.
Exercise can help you manage stress while improving your health. Even short walks can help clear your mind from your duties as a caregiver.
 There are dozens of support groups for caregivers. These can connect you with other caregivers in your area. Not only can they help provide emotional support, but they may be able to assist you with your caregiving duties. You can trade tips, frustrations, or successes.You might consider joining a local chapter of National Network of Caregiving Coalitions, which are advocacy and support groups hosted by the National Alliance for Caregiving.
If you canâ€™t find a group in your area, The Family Caregiver Alliance has online support groups.
 Caregivers who adopt a dog have been shown to have reduced stress and improved health. Depending on the condition of the care recipient, a therapy pet may even be able to provide comfort and relief to the recipient as well.Research the benefits of owning a pet carefully, and consider your position to care for an animal. You may even want to adopt a trained guide animal to provide support to both you and the recipient.
 Take at least fifteen or twenty minutes a day to yourself. Do something to pamper yourself so that you can relax. You may be handling a lot of stress, and while it may be difficult to find time to yourself, consider this part of your self-care routine. During this time, you can:


Write in a journal.
Meditate.
Take a bubble bath.
Stretch.
Read.

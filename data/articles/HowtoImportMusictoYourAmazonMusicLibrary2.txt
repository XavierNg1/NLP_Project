 Launch your smartphone’s app store (Google Play or iTunes App Store).


Search for “Amazon Music with Prime,” select the app from the results, and download it.
 Once you’ve installed Amazon Music, tap on it either on your home screen or app drawer.
 Enter your registered email address and password on the fields provided then tap the “Sign in” button to access your Amazon Music Library.
 Tap the button that says “My Library” at the top of the screen, and a new page will load with a slider at the top of the screen.
 Slide your finger to the left, and all of the music that you have saved on your phone, not your Amazon Music, will load on the screen.
 Do this by tapping and holding any song, album, or artist that you want to save to your Amazon Music Library.


Tap the “Add to Playlist” button that pops up, and a list will appear showing a couple of different options.
Select the playlist you want to add the music to and tap the “OK” button. The music will automatically be saved to your Amazon Music Library.

 For a small amount, use at least 2 tablespoons of peanut butter.


Though you’ll add chocolate syrup in the next step, the amount of peanut butter you use is about how much fake poop you’ll have.
 Drizzle the syrup over the peanut butter until it's completely covered, but not drowning. Mix them together well. The peanut butter should become darker, taking on a more "poo-like" color and texture.


Add more peanut butter or syrup as needed to get the color and texture you want.
 Start with about 30 seconds, then add time 10 seconds at a time until the peanut butter gets loose and pliable. You don't want to burn the peanut butter, or else the fake poo won't look realistic.


You might want to cover the bowl with a paper towel or microwave lid to keep it from splattering and making a mess.
 The fake poo will be pretty hot at this point, so be careful not to burn yourself.


Depending on how thick a consistency you made, you might not even need to spoon it. Turn the bag inside out, grab the mixture, and pull the bag back right-side out.
Seal the peanut butter/syrup mixture into the ziplock bag so it doesn't spill out and make a mess.
 You're going to use it as a spout to squeeze out the mixture in a poo-like shape. The larger the corner you snip off, the thicker the fake poop will be.
 The mixture might still be warm, but do this step before it cools down too much. Once the peanut butter cools down, you won't be able to squeeze it through the bag easily.


Squeeze the fake poop out onto a plate or paper towel.
If you know where you want to place it, you can squeeze it directly into that spot.

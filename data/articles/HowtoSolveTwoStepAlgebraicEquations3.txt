 You can solve a two step equation while keeping the variable on the right side. As long as you isolate it, you'll still get the same answer. Let's take the problem, 11 = 3 - 7x. To solve it, your first step will be to combine the constants by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation. Then, you'll have to divide both sides of the equation by -7 to solve for x. Here's how you do it:


11 = 3 - 7x =
11 - 3 = 3 - 3 - 7x =
8 = - 7x =
8/-7 = -7/7x
-8/7 = x or -1.14 = x

, The principle for solving this type of equation is the same: use arithmetic to combine the constants, isolate the variable term, and then isolate the variable without the term. Let's say you're working with the equation x/5 + 7 = -3. The first thing you should do is subtract 7, the inverse of -3, from both sides, and then multiply both sides by 5 to solve for x. Here's how you do it:


x/5 + 7 = -3 =
(x/5 + 7) - 7 = -3 - 7 =
x/5 = -10
x/5 * 5 = -10 * 5
x = -50

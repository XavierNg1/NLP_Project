 These would be a Dock-to-HDMI adapter and an HDMI cable. These items are available at any Apple Store. There are Dock-to-HDMI adapters for 30-pin cables (older iPads) and 8-pin cables (lightning cables for newer models).;
, First, connect the Dock-to-HDMI adapter to your iPad, and then connect the HDMI cable to the Dock-to-HDMI adapter. Afterwards, plug the other end of the HDMI cable to your HDTV’s HDMI port.
 Do so by switching on your TV and adjusting the video settings so that the display comes from the HDMI port your iPad is currently plugged to.
 You can now view your iPad’s display on your HDTV!

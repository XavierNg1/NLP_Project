 Choose an old object to form the base of your small dog's bed. Make sure that the object is large enough to accommodate your small dog's size, but not too much larger- if your dog is too small for its bed, it can feel insecure. Be sure that the base doesn't have any rough edges, loose nails, splintered wood, or other potentially dangerous spots.Some ideas for perfect bed bases are:


an old dresser drawerthe bed of a small wagon (with axels and wheels removed)an old wine crate (sanded, if needed);
, Find an old pillow or cushion that fits the inside of the bed. If your dog is prone to chewing things, opt for something made of a thicker material (like denim or vinyl). Consider choosing a pillow or cushion with a removable cover to allow for frequent washes., Place the cushioning in the bed base and position the new bed where your dog likes to sleep. Place adhesive furniture pads on the bottom of the bed to avoid scratching the floor or damaging the carpet. Add some of your dog's toys or a favorite blanket to the bed as a finishing touch.Most dogs dislike anyone sneaking up behind them while they're sleeping, so try positioning your dog's bed against a wall to ensure their comfort.

 You can get your brush a little bit wet with ice cold water. then gently brush your hair until it is smooth. then just put you hair in a very loose low ponytail, and overnight your hair should stay smooth and non frizzy. If you are wondering how this can possibly work... well, its because when the cold water is brushed through your hair, it settles the roots and all loose, split ends. Causing them to lay flat overnight.;
, You can buy it at a pharmacy, your local salon, or borrow it from a friend. It's not too expensive so don't worry. Just use the directions on the bottle, and apply to your hair. Then again, place your hair in aÂ loose, low ponytail. Overnight, your hair will relax and frizz may appear more easily; this is why when you wake up, you need to re-comb through your hair, and it will be good to go.
 But when you are applying your conditioner, you need to use a little more than you usually do. A good conditioner will smooth your hair more easily than other products, without having to worry about the overnight frizz re-appearing.

 Doing this will let the horse know that he can be comfortable and relaxed around you. Be mindful of areas where the horse does not like to be touched; be more cautious in these areas and work on them more slowly. Areas that may be uncomfortable for the horse include the stomach, eyes, and mouth. If you sense discomfort, move away from those areas and come back to them at a later time.
Start by using your hands. Once your horse becomes comfortable with your hands, use other materials (bag, cloth) to rub him. Make sure that the other materials will not be abrasive or uncomfortable to the horse.;
, Like rubbing, grooming shows that you are friendly to your horse and will help him trust you.Focus on areas where your horse particularly enjoys to be groomed, such as the withers, tail, and mane.
 Before massaging your horse, make sure that he is comfortable being stroked.,

, Unroll the marzipan, removing its protective covering.


Lay the circle of marzipan over the cake.
 Use your fingers and whole hand, gently pressing down, so that it fits firmly over the cake. Cut off any excess marzipan to tidy it up.
 Into the large bowl add the icing sugar and a dash of water and begin to mix it in. Gradually add the rest of the water, while stirring constantly, until it forms a thick, smooth paste.



Using the spatula, spoon a dollop of icing sugar on the cake and spread it over evenly.
Spoon on a little more and spread it over around the sides. Continue spreading until the entire cake has been covered.
Smooth over and around the fringe of the cake as a final finish. Make sure it looks neat.

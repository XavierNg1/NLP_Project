 Rocks and trees offer the easiest access to live moss. Place the scraper under one corner of the moss and slowly work forward, lifting the moss from the rock, tree or surface as you go. Dislodge the moss in the largest pieces possible.


Use a rake if you are having difficulty getting the moss to come off its surface cleanly.
Use a plastic scraper for particularly stubborn pieces of moss.;
,, Pick out all twigs, leaves, pine needles or other stray materials stuck in the moss and discard outside.
 Place it on a paper towel or other absorbent surface. Press your palm against the moss into the absorbent surface. (When squeezing the moss, don't ball the moss up in your hands. When moss dries, it can become brittle and difficult to work with. Unfolding the moss can cause it to break into small pieces.) Spread all partially dry pieces of moss onto a flat surface.


The surface should receive generous ventilation (open windows, outside breeze, fans or other air source).
 This prevents the moss from blowing away or becoming folded or twisted while drying.

Remove twigs as for drying.






Place moss in a cooking pot.






Add 1 part glycerin to 3 parts water.






Add fabric dye as desired.






Bring the contents almost to a boil.






Remove from heat.






Cool for one hour.






If you want the moss to take on a greater amount of color, you can allow it to sit in the glycerin, water and dye solution for a greater amount of time.
 Squeeze out excess moisture. Dry as you would for other, non-dyed moss.

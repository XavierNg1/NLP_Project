 If you are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you will usually be put on insulin injection. Insulin injections provide the body with otherwise missing insulin that helps in the uptake of glucose from the blood stream.


That way, the glucose in the blood can be taken to the cells where it is used for the production of energy.
Type 1 diabetic patients are advised to use insulin injections everyday to ensure that their blood sugar is controlled.;
, You must learn to inject yourself unless you are too young to understand. Learning how to administer insulin to yourself effectively will ensure that you do not suffer from spiked blood sugar every time you are away from someone who can administer your insulin.


If you want to administer insulin for your child, you can learn how by following the instructions of your child's doctor.
Your child will be taught how to inject him/herself as they grow up and are able to understand.
Most children are able to self-administer the injections when they reach the age of 14.
 Insulin is usually injected into the skin using a pump, insulin pen, or syringe. You can choose what method you would prefer to administer your own insulin.


Insulin is usually given via injection because it cannot be taken through the mouth.
This is because the acid that is in the stomach will destroy the insulin.
 There are different types of insulin and they all act differently. As you age, your doctor will advise you on the best type for you.


Some of them are long acting, meaning that they are released slowly in the body, and this type includes NPH.
Some are short acting, meaning that they take effect immediately, which may cause the blood sugar drop rapidly. Short acting insulins include Humalog and Novolog.
The amount of insulin you take is usually adjusted depending on the following factors:

Exercise
Diet
Health condition, in case you are sick

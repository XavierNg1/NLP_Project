 Linked layers stay discrete, meaning you could edit them separately if you wanted. However, every time you click on one linked layer, you automatically adjust the layer(s) it is linked to as well. This is a good way to make large changes to many layers without having to merge., If you've got a series of layers that all make up the same image, such as a shading, sketching, and inking layer for a small animated character, you can group them together, allowing you to see and work on just these layers in the larger image. To group:


Select multiple layers in the layers panel.
Right-click and select "Group from Layers." You can also drag the layers onto the little folder icon in the bottom of the layers panel.
 This is only an issue, on occasion, with merging. Still, if none of your options come up to merge, try to:


Right-click and select "Rasterize."
Check to make sure the layers are visible
Make sure clipping masks are selected as well -- you need to highlight them to merge, or they may not let you merge.

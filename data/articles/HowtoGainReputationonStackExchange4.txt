 An edit involves editing someone's post or editing a tag.


Finding edits are easy. If you know where to look, new users will usually make more mistakes, so check their post first. You can identify new users because they will have very low reputation (usually about one reputation point). This will help both of you, since you can show the user how to fix the mistake, and you can gain some reputation.
 This step will focus on editing a tag, because posts are easy just click on "edit" and your halfway there.


Identify the Tags. And click on one.
Click on "improve tag wiki" and edit as appropriate.
 Don't plagiarize or write with bad grammar or punctuation. Use well-defined words, and, if in doubt, look at how other people's tags are done. Never use Wikipedia; make your own edit.


Realize that other users will have to check your edit before you get reputation. If they "throw it out", then you gain no rep.
Once you gain Tag Wiki Editing or Editing Questions and Answers Privileges, you no longer gain rep.

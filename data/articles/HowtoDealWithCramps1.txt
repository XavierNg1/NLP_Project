 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen are very effective at relieving pain from cramps. When you feel the pain coming on, take a painkiller, and the pain should go away in half an hour or so.


Do not take more than the recommended dosage stated on the pain medicine bottle, unless otherwise advised by a physician.
Some pain relief medicines are created specifically for dealing with cramps and other conditions associated with menstruation. If aspirin and ibuprofen don't work for you, consider trying Midol, which contains acetaminophen.;
, Cramps are caused when your uterus, which is a muscle, contracts to release its lining. Muscle pain always feels better when heat is applied, and the uterus is no exception.


Lie down and lay a hot water bottle or other hot compress across your abdomen.
You could also apply heat by taking a warm bath or shower to ease the pain.
 Drinking a warm, soothing fluid can help relax your muscles, and certain herbs are said to effectively relieve cramps. Brew up a pot of tea with one of the following herbs:


Raspberry leaf, which is said to help relax the uterus.
Cramp bark, a powerful herb that is said to ease uterine muscle contractions.
Dong Quai, which is relaxing to the nervous system.
 Kneading the muscles in your lower back and abdomen can go a long way toward easing the pain of cramps.Use a self massaging tool or have a partner work on these areas for you. If you're in the mood to splurge, hire a masseuse for a professional job.

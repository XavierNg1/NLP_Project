 As you go through life, some things will go the way you want and others won’t. Making a list of your failures or shortcomings can point you in the direction of your weaknesses. Write down anything in life that didn’t turn out the way you had hoped.For example, if you continuously fail to keep a relationship going for more than a few months, write that down.;
, If your shortcomings have a common thread, this is a clear weakness. Now that you’ve identified that weakness you can start developing a strategy to work on it. When you overcome the weakness, there’s a better chance that your future outcomes will be what you want.For example, if you struggle to get along with family and coworkers, you might be weak in communication skills.
 You might not always recognize your own weaknesses. Sometimes, it helps if you ask for feedback from people that know you well. Get the opinion of your boss, your spouse, or anyone else that you know well.


Avoid becoming defensive when asking for feedback. Thank the other person for their honest advice, and they will be more likely to be open with you in the future.
 If there are areas of life that make you unhappy, it may be because you feel weak or unsuited to handle those areas well. Make a note of such things and see if there is any correlation between your weaknesses and the changes you want to make. You will likely find that these changes all stem from an area that you are not well suited to handle.For example, if you wish your house was cleaner and your office was less cluttered, it isn’t a stretch to say that you might have a weakness in organization. Finding that weakness is the first step to overcoming it.

 Screening will be enabled, so you won't have picked up the phone even after you answer the call. Instead, you will be given a list of options of what to do: pressing 1 will answer the call and pressing 2 will send it to voicemail.,,, If you hear part of the voicemail and see that you should answer it, just press * and you'll be connected to the person on the other end of the line. Make sure to listen to your phone's prompts at the beginning -- some systems will require you to press * to pick up the call while others will say that you should press 1 + 4.

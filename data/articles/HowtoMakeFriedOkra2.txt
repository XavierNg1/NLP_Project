Alternatively, you can also line the baking sheet with parchment paper or a light coating of nonstick cooking spray.
 Rinse the okra under cool, running water and let it dry. Use a sharp knife to cut the okra into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) slices.


The best way to clean the okra is by placing it into a colander and rinsing it under running water for about 30 seconds. Remove the okra from the water and allow it to sit in the colander for another 30 seconds so that the excess moisture drips off.
 Place the cornmeal, flour, salt, pepper, and paprika in a medium mixing bowl. Toss the ingredients together with a whisk until evenly distributed.


You can vary the spices by personal taste, if desired. Other options worth considering may include cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, or chili powder.
 Pour the buttermilk into a separate medium bowl. Toss the okra pieces into the buttermilk, stirring well to coat all sides.Allow the okra to sit for 20 to 30 seconds before continuing.


It's best to work in two or more batches to ensure a thorough coating.
If you do not have buttermilk, you could use 2 lightly beaten eggs or 3 lightly beaten egg yolks instead.
 Remove the okra from the buttermilk, allowing the excess liquid to drip off and back into the bowl. Transfer the moist okra to the dry breading ingredients and toss to coat all sides.


As before, it's best to continue working in batches.
 Spread the coated okra onto your prepared baking sheet in an even layer. Place the okra in the oven and roast it for about 30 minutes, or until the coating looks crispy and golden brown.


After approximately 15 minutes, gently flip and stir the okra with a spatula to promote even browning throughout.
 Remove the finished okra from the oven and enjoy it while it's still hot.


You can serve the okra with salt, hot sauce, and ketchup.

 Alcohol disrupts the sleep cycle, so part of the reason you are feeling so tired is because your body is sleep-deprived. Getting a few more hours of sleep will have you feeling better in no time.
 Hangovers cause hypersensitivity to light and noise. Wear sunglasses if you are leaving the house, and avoid listening to loud music.


If you are having trouble getting out of bed or are continuing to vomit, consider calling in sick to work or school. While you wouldn't want to make this a habit, you are probably not going to be of much use at work if you are constantly running to the bathroom.
 The endorphins released during exercise can help improve your mood, which is important if you are feeling anxious as a result of being hungover. Exercise also speeds up the the process of metabolizing the alcohol, helping it leave your system faster. Be sure to properly hydrate both before and after exercising to prevent further fluid loss.
 Beating yourself up for having a hangover will only make you feel worse. Giving yourself time to rest and recover is the only way to make it go away, so take advantage of your "free" day by catching up on your favorite shows, watching a new movie, or reading a book. You'll feel better tomorrow.

 There are numerous gun shows in Texas every week, in many locations around the state. A quick search online will help you find a gun show near you.


The website GunShowTrader.com maintains a calendar of all the gun shows coming up. You can check their site for a list of dates and locations.
 Guns are not cheap, and prices vary widely. You will be mostly likely to find what you want, and at a price that is appropriate, if you do some research online to compare prices before you go to the gun show.
 Some gun shows focus on a particular type of firearm or weapon; some gun shows are more general. You will have the best success if you plan to take your time and look around before making a decision., Buying a gun is not like buying a loaf of bread at the grocery store. There is not a single set price that you have to “take it or leave it.” If you know what you are looking for and have done some research on its value, you may be able to negotiate with the dealer for a lower price., You will be required to show personal identification. If you are not a Texas resident, your purchase may be delayed. In Texas, there is no mandatory waiting period to complete the purchase, but the seller (if reputable) will check your identification in a criminal database to verify that you are eligible to purchase a gun.

, While all henna stains a reddish-brown color, different regions do produce subtle differences. African hennas are often stringier, which helps making fine lines. Moroccan and Yemeni hennas are know for their stringiness. Many people say African henna is warm red, Persian henna is deeper red, and Indian henna is brownish red. These slight color variations are not set in stone, and are usually not even noticeable. Usually color variations depend on the body's chemistry not on the kind of henna used.
 High quality henna has been sifted several times. Cheaper hennas need more sifting which you can usually tell from comparing to other better sifted hennas, or else they can clog applicators.
 Do research reviews to see your hair type and natural colour and what results you can expect. Also check the expiry date.
 India exports the most henna, with a variety of brands from different regions in India. Other countries, like Oman, don't export at all. If you travel, or have a globe trotting friend, get some henna sent back to your home.

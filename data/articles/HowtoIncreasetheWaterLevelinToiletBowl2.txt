 Some newer toilets are equipped with more modern one-piece floats (also sometimes known as “floating cups”) rather than the old fashioned ball-and-arm design. These types of floats have been engineered as solid cylinders fitted to the shaft of the fill valve itself. If you have a fill valve with a cylinder float, you can adjust the water level in your toilet in just a few seconds.


These types of valves are easy to install, remove and perform maintenance on, and can be set manually even by inexperienced users.
If you’re still using a valve with a ball-and-arm float, it’s recommended that you upgrade.Turn off the water supply, then flush the toilet to empty the tank before you start working.
 The adjustment stem is a long, slender tube that connects to the larger fill valve. In most models, it will either run parallel with the valve or extend horizontally out from the top. The adjustment stem is used increase or decrease the amount of water in the tank.Take some time to familiarize yourself with the construction of the mechanisms inside your toilet tank before making any drastic changes.
Some types of cylinder floats can be positioned by squeezing a release clip on the float itself and simply raising or lowering it to the desired height., Use two fingers to grasp the notched dial on the end of the stem. Twist the stem counterclockwise one full rotation. This will cause the float to rise gradually. Once you’ve found a suitable height for the float, replace the toilet lid and turn the water valve back on.If you’re having trouble turning the adjustment stem, see if there’s a notch for you to use a screwdriver.Flush the toilet a couple of times to check whether the water level in the bowl has risen if not, the float may need further fine-tuning.

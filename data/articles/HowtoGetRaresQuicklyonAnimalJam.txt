If you're new in Animal Jam, then you can make friends by saying "please add me, nice Jammers";
, Sometimes, if you act nice and truly mean it, they will give you items. Always be a nice friend!

, Don't start trading just yet, get clearance items, and try to get on during Mondays for the weekly rare.
 Go to an area of high population and shout "trade me". If you can't get to Jamaa Township or Coral Canyons, just keep clicking.
 If you have an item you really love, but everyone wants it, try to get a tradable duplicate!

Aldan is the rarest server. Wear your rares, and start yelling "trade me!"

, Only add real friends.

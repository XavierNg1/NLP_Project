 Instead of saying something vague like, “You’re good at school,” try something like, “You’re so talented in art class. Your last project was great. I wish I could draw that well!” Instead of a neutral answer like, “You’re always nice to everyone,” you can say, “You really go out of your way to be kind and compassionate to other people." Use words that are specific and stand out as positive, like “talented” and “compassionate.” Try things like:


“You’re fearless! I love how brave you are.”"You're so knowledgeable and passionate about music! Every time we hang out, you share new bands with me."

, Are they funny? Smart? Determined? Talented? Happy? Attractive? Energetic? Whatever it is, tell them about it! Say things like:


“I like how funny you are. You always make me laugh when we hang out!”
“I like that you’re a happy and positive person. You create a good vibe around yourself and I like being around you.”

, It’s okay to tell someone they are pretty or handsome – you don’t have to avoid saying it! But if looks are the only thing you mention to them, the person might walk away feeling that their outward appearance is the only likable thing about them. Say things like:


“You’re a great listener.”
“You inspire me.”
"You have a good heart.”

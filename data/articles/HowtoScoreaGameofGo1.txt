 A game of Go is not over until both players have passed play or when one player resigns. In Go, you pass play if you have no moves left. Therefore, if both players pass play, then there are no more good moves to be made and the game is over., The intersections or points in Go are worth one point each. Count up the points that you have surrounded with your stones.If you have an area partially surrounded, then it is considered neutral and it does not count for a point.Write down the total number of points that you have.
 After you have counted your points, you will need to count up your stones. Any stones that are left on the board may be included in this total. Write down this number after you have finished counting up all of your stones., Once you have determined your total number of empty points and your total number of stones, add these two numbers together. Your total number is your final score. Compare your total score to your opponentâ€™s total score to determine the winner.

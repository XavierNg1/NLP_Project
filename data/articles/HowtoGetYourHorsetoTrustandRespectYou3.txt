 Do not let up on the pressure until your horse gives in by lowering his head, even if only slightly.The first time you try this, you may be waiting for several minutes before your horse responds to the pressure. Just be patient and continue to apply pressure.
 The goal is to make your horse comfortable with giving in to pressure on any part of his body.Other parts of your horse's body to which you can apply pressure include his legs, hips and muzzle.
Horses apply pressure to each other as a way of asserting dominance. Therefore, if your horse gives in to your pressure, this is an indication that you are dominant to him.
 Although this can be time-consuming and take a lot of patience, using pressure is an important step towards building trust and respect with your horse.

 Even after you uninstall Babylon from your computer, its remnants can still affect your internet. To completely purge your computer, you'll need to delete these from your browser.
 Firefox's "Reset" feature makes it easy to remove all add-ons and get back to a clean state. You can do this several ways:


Go to this Firefox page and click the "Refresh Firefox" button. You must view the page in Firefox for this to work.Type "about:support" into the Firefox address bar. On the next page, click the "Refresh Firefox" button in the top right.

Note: Refreshing Firefox will remove any add-ons you have installed (including Babylon). It will not delete your browsing history, any saved passwords, your bookmarks, and more. Click here for more information., Firefox will close as it starts to refresh itself. Once it is done, a window will appear displaying which features have been saved. Click "Finish" to end the process.

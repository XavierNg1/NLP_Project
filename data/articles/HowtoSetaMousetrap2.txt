 A wide variety of "humane traps" are on the market, which will enclose mice without killing them, but all work with the same basic principle. Generally, these traps involve a wire cage or a plastic tube with a door on each end. After entering the cage or tube in search of the food you've placed there, the trap will close, trapping the mouse safely inside.
 Open one or both of the openings of the trap, activating the mechanism (usually a small lever) that keeps the doors open.
 Popular baits include apples, peanut butter, and cheese.
 If you're hoping to catch the mice alive, you'll want to make sure to keep up with them.


Mice trapped together have a tendency to eat each other.



Don't release them in the backyard or near other houses the mice might take up residence in.
Find a wooded area or a park to release the mice.

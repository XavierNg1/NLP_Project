 This will improve your complexion. Use a cleanser, toner, and moisturizer. You should start this anywhere between one to two weeks before picture day.;
, You can find something to wear that you already own, but buying something new is always fun. Make sure you select a shirt in a color that looks good on you. There are a couple of ways to figure out which colors look best on you:


Ask your parents or friends which colors they think look best on you.
If you get a lot of compliments when you're wearing a specific color, it probably means that it flatters your skin tone and hair. Remember that in most pictures all that matters is the top you are wearing.
, Practice the style that you have in mind to ensure that it's easy to do and that it looks nice. For a sleek look, flat-iron your hair. For a cute look, pull back the top layer of your hair into a ponytail and secure it with a bow or barrette. Make sure you don't put all of your hair into a tight ponytail, or you'll end up looking bald. Straighten your hair, alternatively, and let it loose but don't allow it to cover your face and eyes.
 Don't overdo it, especially with foundation. Stick to your basic regiment, but add a few special details. Try wearing gold eyeshadow, curling your eyelashes, and wearing sparkly lip-gloss (if you have braces, try a matte, natural lipstick instead).
 Figure out what smile looks best on you. Try closed and open-mouthed smiles. For a natural open mouth, smile, push the tops of your back teeth with your tongue.
 Make sure to keep your smile natural. Hopefully, it goes well!

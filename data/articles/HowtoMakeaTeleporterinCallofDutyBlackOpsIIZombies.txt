 There is a lamp post. Place your Turbine there.;
, Once a Denizen leaps onto your head, run back, and knife it off. For maximum effectiveness, wait on the inside edge of the fog. Stay until you hear the Denizen screech, and take off to the lamp. Don't worry, once it screeches, it practically locks onto you. Knife it once or twice, and it will let go.
 Happy hunting!

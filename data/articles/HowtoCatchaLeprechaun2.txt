 Make a boundary in which to play tag. Give 3 to 5 kids a gold coin and a gold sash. Tell them they are the leprechauns. Name the other students “the Shamrocks.” Play tag, and when a leprechaun is tagged, he or she must give up the gold coin.
Whoever gets the most gold coins wins. Play again with new leprechauns to give everyone a chance to win.
 Use the method for creating barefoot leprechaun prints with tempera paint.


Have your children follow the footprints to the next clue. Leave a leprechaun item, like a pipe, small hat, coin, rainbow or shoe at each station.
Place riddles at each station that they have to solve before moving on. Make a pot of gold filled with chocolate coins at the end as the treasure. Leave a note from the leprechaun teasing the kids to catch him next year.

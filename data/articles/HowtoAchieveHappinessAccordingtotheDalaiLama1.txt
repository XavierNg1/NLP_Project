 The human nature is not perfect and neither is the world we live in. We have to endure suffering such as sickness, old age, and death; we have to endure psychological suffering too like sadness, fear, frustration, disappointment, and depression.
However, there are positive experiences too that we perceive as the opposite of suffering, such as comfort and happiness. Life is imperfect and incomplete, because our world is subject to impermanence. This means we are never able to keep what we strive for, and just as happy moments pass by; our loved ones and we ourselves will pass away too.;
, Transient things do not only include the physical objects that surround us, but also ideas. Ignorance is the lack of understanding of how our mind is attached to impermanence.
The reasons for suffering are; unwholesome desire, lust, pursuit of wealth and prestige, striving for fame and popularity. Because the objects of our attachment are transient, their loss is inevitable, thus suffering will follow.
Objects of attachment also include the idea of a "self" which is a delusion, because there is no self. What we call "self" is just an imprint we make on the body we occupy.
 Suffering can be overcome through human activity simply by removing the cause of suffering. Eliminating negative thoughts, deeds and unwholesome sensual desire is the process that results in the state of Nirvana. Nirvana means psychological freedom from worries, fears and harmful desires that cause of our suffering.
 It is a path of self improvement which is described in more detail in the eightfold path. It is the middle way between the two extremes of self indulgence and self denial. It is also a gradual method of self improvement.

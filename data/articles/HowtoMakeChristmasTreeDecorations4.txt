 They can be any size you like, just make sure that they have easily removable tops.
 Gently remove the tops from the glass ornaments (you don't want to damage them) and pour a small amount of floor wax or floor finish into the glass ball.


This may sound strange, but this is what allows the glitter to stick to the inside of the ball. Just make sure the product you use is acrylic based and clear drying.
Gently swirl the product around the inside of the ornament, making sure the entire inside surface is coated in floor wax.
Once you're done, you can pour the floor wax back into the bottle. Waste not, want not!

, Pour a substantial amount of your chosen glitter into the glass ornament and swirl it around until the glitter completely covers the interior of the ornament. Shake any excess back into the container of glitter.


You can choose any colors you like --gold, silver, red, blue, green, purple -- whichever ones go with the color scheme for your tree.
If you want to be really wild, you could even try mixing a few different colors for a real disco ball effect.
 Once the glitter has dried, you can replace the top of the ornament. Use a little to secure it in place if it feels in any way loose.
 If you like, you can leave the glitter ball ornaments as they are. Alternatively, you can decorate the outsides using snowflake- or star-shaped scrapbook stickers and some diamante sequins.

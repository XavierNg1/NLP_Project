 When you want to use a bun to create waves in your hair, it’s best to start with at least partially damp hair. If you’re washing your hair in the morning, blow or air dry it halfway before creating the bun. If you don’t plan to wash your hair, lightly mist it with a spray bottle filled with water.Instead of water, you can also use a leave-in conditioner spray to dampen your hair before putting in a bun.;
, Gather your hair into a ponytail in the spot where you would like your bun to be. Twist your hair around itself, and use bobby pins to secure the bun to your head. Apply a light layer of flexible hold hairspray to help keep your hair in place.You’ll get waves from your bun no matter where you position it, so go for a sophisticated top knot further up your head, a traditional bun at the middle of the back of your head, or a casual, low bun at the nape of your neck.
For the most defined waves in the evening, twist your hair tightly as you form the bun. If you prefer looser curls, maker your bun looser.
 When you’re ready to go out for the night, it’s time to let your hair down. Remove the bobby pins to undo your bun, and flip your head upside down. Use your fingers to carefully shake out and soften the waves.Be careful not to pull on your hair too much as you’re finger-combing it or you may remove the waves.
 To play up the wavy texture of your hair, lightly apply a texturizing spray. Use your fingers to scrunch the product into your hair and emphasize the waves that you have. Arrange your hair as you’d like, and you’re ready to head out for the evening.You may want to give your hair a light misting of flexible hold hairspray once you’re happy with the way that your waves look. That will help your style last all night.

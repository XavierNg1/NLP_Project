 Before any serious athletic activity you should always perform a warm up. The warm up should get the blood flowing through your body and increase your heart rate. It needs to be active and dynamic.Jumping jacks and jogging can be good warm up exercises.
If you are exercising in cold weather you should allow extra time for your warm up., You should devote several minutes to stretching before you run, play sports, swim or workout on machines, in order to decrease your risk of hamstring injury. This is especially important if you have had hamstring injuries in the past. After your initial warm up exercises, run through a few static and dynamic hamstring stretches.


Warm and stretched muscles are less likely to tear during exercise.A good warm up stretch involves lying on your back with your knees bent. Cup your hands behind one knee and bring it down towards you chest.
Hold it for around fifteen seconds keeping your head, back and butt on the ground.
Release and switch sides.
 After exercises repeat you should perform a cool down and stretch. Do some light aerobic exercise, such as jogging on spot and then stretch your hamstrings. Do not wait for the muscles to cramp up before repeating the stretches you did before your workout. After exercise your muscles are pliable and this can reduce injury and cramping.


A good cool down stretch just involves sitting down with your back straight and your legs out in front of you.
Reach down towards your toes with both hands, hold for ten seconds, release and repeat.
You might it easier to do this while sitting on a yoga block or a cushion.

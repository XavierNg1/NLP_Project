 A great way to make a secret fort indoors is by hiding it in plain sight. No one will guess the place you sleep is a spy base. Place two to three chairs on one side of your bed, preferably on the opposite side of your bedroom door. Throw blankets or sheets over the chairs and hold the other ends on your bed with heavy books., Find a large box to use as a fort. If you or anyone you know is sent something big, like a T.V. or refrigerator, claim the box it comes in as your own. Find a discreet spot to set up spy camp. Put it behind your bed or other furniture.
 If your kitchen has lower cabinets, this can be a great place for an indoor spy fort. Clear several ones out next to each other for an extra spacious hideout. This is also a great opportunity to help your parents reorganize the kitchen.
 Very similar to using kitchen cabinets, but this hideout can be cleared out and claimed from any number of closets throughout your house. Find a closet that is not used very often in a room the least amount of people go into. Make this closet your spy fort.

 You are known as an aspirant during this initial phase in the ordination process.;
,


Ask your rector to pray with you and tell him or her that you are exploring the possibility that you are called to ordination as a priest.
You will meet with representatives of the congregation, usually the Vestry (the elected lay leadership of the congregation) if your priest agrees that you may have a vocation. They will help decide whether to present you to your diocesan bishop and Commission on Ministry for consideration as a postulant for ordination, which is the next step in the process toward ordination.
 Share your discernment process to date and ask for guidance.


Your diocesan bishop and Commission on Ministry will determine whether to approve you as a postulant, the first formal step in the ordination process.



The Episcopal Church has 11 accredited seminaries that prepare students for the priesthood.
You must apply to, and be accepted by, a seminary, which is a 3-year graduate program leading to a Masters Degree in Divinity.
You may, if your diocese permits, attend a non-Episcopal seminary. You will need to complete additional studies or training in the Anglican tradition.



Postulants write Ember Day letters 4 times during the year to their bishops. Ember Day letters are written during the week of the third Sunday in Advent, the week after the first Sunday in Lent, the week beginning with Pentecost, and the week after the first Sunday following Holy Cross Day. Ember Days are traditionally special days of prayer and fasting for those preparing for ordination. Ember Day letters report to the bishop on your reflections during this phase of your spiritual journey.
You will also continue during seminary to meet with your bishop and other diocesan representatives as prescribed by the regulations of your diocese.
 You will usually be a candidate for at least 6 months before applying for ordination as a deacon.



All candidates for ordination must take and pass the GOE.
The exam consists of 7 essay questions, given over 5 days. Candidates are given 3 hours for each essay.
The GOE covers the 7 canonical areas of the Holy Scriptures, Church History, Christian Theology, Christian Ethics, Contemporary Society, Liturgics and Music and Theory and Practice of Ministry.
A new exam is developed each year by the General Board of Examiners of the church.



You will serve as a deacon for at least 6 months before being ordained a priest.

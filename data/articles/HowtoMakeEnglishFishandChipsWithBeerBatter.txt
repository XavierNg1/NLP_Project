 Begin by pouring all the oil into a large pan. Turn the heat up to medium-high. Using a candy/deep fry thermometer, try to maintain 375 °F (191 °C) during frying.

, Into a bowl, add the flour, the corn starch, the salt and the baking powder. Mix together, until evenly combined. Set aside.
 Place the beer into a bowl, and then add the egg. Whisk it together well until the egg and beer are evenly combined.
 Pour the beer mixture into the bowl containing the flour mixture. Whisk well for a couple of minutes, to ensure that it combines smoothly, and is free of lumps. You can now prepare your fish.
 Take a fillet and pat it dry using a piece of paper towel. This will help it fry better; as any excess water will only make the fish less crispy.
 This is especially important if you are cooking for little children. Repeat with the other fillet.
 With a large fork, dip one of the fillets into the bowl of batter and coat it completely.
 Test it by dropping some of the batter into the oil. If it fries immediately, without burning, it's at the correct temperature.
, Let the fillet fry for roughly 4-7 minutes, depending on its size. Flip it at least once during this time, to ensure that it's cooking evenly. When the batter becomes a light golden brown, remove it from the pan. Transfer it to a tray lined with paper. Repeat exactly the same frying process with the remaining fillet.
 Your fish in beer batter is now ready to serve. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.

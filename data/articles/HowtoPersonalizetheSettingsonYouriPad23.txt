 An arrow icon will appear if an app is requesting your location. This is usually turned on by default, but you can turn if off if desired.
 Tap Settings, then tap Location Services and turn off the function. If the function is already turned off, flip the switch to on to restore them.


You can also turn Location Services off individually by choosing the app listed in Location Services.

 The error message you're receiving may be caused by a bad internet connection. The quickest way to test this is to open another browser (Internet Explorer and Safari are installed automatically on Windows and OS X, respectively) and try to visit some websites. If you can load the websites, something is wrong with Chrome. See the following methods for steps on fixing it. If you can't load any websites, chances are something is wrong with your internet connection.If you're just receiving errors for one website, that site is probably down or not responding properly.
 If you are connected to your router via Ethernet, ensure that the cable is connected properly. If you are connected via wireless, ensure you have a good signal.

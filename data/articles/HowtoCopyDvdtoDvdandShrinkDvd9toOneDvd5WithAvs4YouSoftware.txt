 Click the Browse button in the right top corner of the program window to open the DVD.Note: if your input DVD is a DVD9 disc, it is recommended that you use a double layer DVD for the output to achieve better quality.;
, In the Copy Mode and Languages area you can choose elements of the video and audio languages you wish to copy. You can copy:


..ENTIRE DVD (including the original menu and all extra videos),
..the DVD content WITHOUT EXTRAS (menu only),
..ONLY MOVIE (all extra videos and menus will be removed),
..the USER DEFINED titles (the selected titles only).
 As far as the languages are concerned, please do not make any changes to them if you want to make a 1:1 copy. If you want to leave only one language deselect all unnecessary check boxes. Some DVDs may have no language changing option.Note: AVS DVD Copy always preserves all subtitles, because of their small size.
 Click the first Browse button in the Select output DVD (drive or HDD folder) area to set the destination path. Here you can select:


the same drive as the input one,
the second DVD drive (if you have one),
a folder on your computer HDD.

If you select the same drive as the input one, AVS DVD Copy will ask you to remove the input DVD and insert a blank disc after the conversion is finished. Note: you need to have at least 5 GB of free disc space on your hard drive if you copy to an ordinary DVD and 9 GB if you use the double layer discs for output video. You can specify a temporary folder on the hard drive. Click the second Browse button for this task. If you want to change the copying mode and copy, for example, the entire DVD9 with menu and extras, please, select the appropriate disc type from the Set output size drop-down box.
 Click on Start copying! Now you can watch the progress of the converting and writing process. After the conversion is completed AVS DVD Copy will ask you to insert a blank DVD disc to the DVD recorder. Click Continue.

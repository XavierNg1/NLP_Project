 The Battery app is located within the Settings app. Tap the Settings app then scroll down to the Battery app, which is located beneath “Touch ID & Passcode.”, Tap the power toggle to the right of each entry to turn either of these features on or off. They are both off by default.



Low Power Mode limits functionality to conserve power. Push notifications, background app refresh, downloads, and visual effects are either reduced or turned off. You will be prompted to turn this feature on when your battery reaches 20% and 10%, respectively. It can also be turned on manually to remain active at all times, though this is not recommended as you may not receive notifications immediately.

Battery Percentage adds a numerical readout next to your battery icon in the status bar. This feature is turned on by default when Low Power Mode is active. It can also be set to remain on at all times without impacting performance.
 This is where you will see a list of apps you’ve used since your last full charge, with percentage values on the right. The percentage values indicate the proportion of battery power used by each app, from highest to lowest. Beneath each app’s entry, you can view an estimate of hours spent on screen versus time active in the background.
 This entry has two labels, one marked “Usage” and the other marked “Standby.” Each entry offers time estimates for the total hours your device was actually in use, compared to the hours spent in standby.

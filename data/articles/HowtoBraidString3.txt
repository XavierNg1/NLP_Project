 Arrange them so the ends are even.
 This braid will also lay flat.
 One will be the right group and one will be the left group. Keep some distance between these two groups as you braid.
 Once you understand it, you can try grasping a string in four of your fingers on each hand.
 Take it over the next string, under the next string and over the last string in the left group. Place it alongside the inner portion of the right group of string.


The right group should now have five strings and the left group should have three.
 Take it under, over, under then over. It should now be on the inside of the left group of string.
 Then, take the right outer string under, over, under and over to meet the left group., Finished!

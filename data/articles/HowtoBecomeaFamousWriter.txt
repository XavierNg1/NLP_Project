 There is no point in doing all of this work if you still aren't sure about it! Be confident in yourself, and know that you can do it even if you are unsure.;
, It is okay to start off with easy books and work your way up. Try to read as much so, you can to become familiar with words.
 When you have finished your book, expand it. Keep on doing this, but with different kinds of stories such as History, Magic, (etc.)

, Write something every day, even if it is only a nonsense word or a small, free verse poem. If you want to write for TV, and you can afford it, Google 'professional TV advisors' and get help from the professionals.
 It will help you feel how it is to write. Even if it is fiction or non-fiction. You need to get the hang of it!

, Let your stories be read. Soon after, you'll probably be recognized by a magazine or website.
 Even if you've been waiting for a while to see if anyone likes your writing, wait! Patience is the key. And if someone doesn't like it, ask someone else to look at it. Maybe a friend or a family member. Don't let your hopes down!

, Write what you are interested in reading about. Let your characters be real to you, and know them all from Eve. Love your characters like they are your best friends.
 When you come across a new word, don't just skip it- learn it! Then apply some new words you've learned to your daily conversation or in your writing.
 See if you like them!

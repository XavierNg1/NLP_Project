After logging in, NFSW will initiate an update. As soon as NFSW has finished downloading and installing all the required updates from the Internet, a dialog box with a “Play” button will appear.
 Click on the “Play” button, and press “Enter” or any other key to start. This will load and display your NFSW profile details.


Click “Enter World” to enter the NFS World in Free Roam mode.
 You can do this by pressing M on your keyboard or by clicking the second icon from right on the row of icons at the top of your NFSW screen. The icon should say “World Map” if you hover your mouse on it.
 The map displays the city’s race locations using blue and red icons, and Team Escape races are represented by red icons that are shaped like an arrow.
 You can do this by hovering your mouse over the icon and then, on the dialog box that appears click “Join.” This will immediately enter you into the Team Escape event.

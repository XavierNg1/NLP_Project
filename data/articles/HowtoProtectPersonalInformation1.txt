 This is one of the most common mistakes people make. Do not share every personal detail about you on these kinds of sites.


For example, when you get your first credit card, don’t get too excited and post a photo of your credit card on Facebook or Twitter. Once people get a hold of your valuable information through social networking sites, they are free to use it anyway they like.;
, Your personal computer holds very important and personal data about you. When you connect it to an unsecure public Internet connection, like a cafe Wi-Fi, people can easily hack into your computer and steal any information stored on it.
 There are times when you’ll get an e-mail from someone pretending to be someone you know, and then ask questions either about your bank information, addresses, or details about other people. When this happens, do not give out any information as these people are probably impersonators preying on unsuspecting people.
 Phishing sites copy other legitimate websites, such as banks, online shops, and more, and deliberately name their website addresses closely similar to the original site. When people make mistakes in typing the web addresses, they won’t notice the mistake and continue to enter their login information and other details , not knowing that they are on the wrong site and that they've just given away valuable personal and account information.
 Malicious programs such as spywares track everything you do on your computer, from websites you visit even up to keyboard buttons you press.

 Visit PayPal and navigate directly to the Help Center page by clicking on the "Contact" link at the bottom of any PayPal page.
 Look for the "Email Us" link near the top of the Help Center main page. Click on this link to be redirected to the appropriate page.


You'll be prompted to log in; doing so is recommended when possible. If you are unable to sign into an account, however, proceed with the next step.
 If you are unable to log into your PayPal account or would otherwise like to proceed as a guest, click on the "Having problems logging in?" link beneath the "Contact Us As a Guest" header.


While you're technically supposed to use that link only if you are unable to sign into your PayPal account, you can still try using it if you don't have an account yet.
Note that you may also see a link stating "contact Help Center as a guest." Clicking on this link will show you the Help Center phone number, however, and will not redirect you to an e-mail form.
 You'll need to provide your first name, last name, and e-mail address in the first three text boxes, respectively, on the "Problems logging in?" contact form.


If you have a PayPal account but are currently unable to sign into it, use the name and e-mail address linked to that account when filling out the form.
 After providing your contact information, click inside the "Message" text box and type your full question or concern.


Provide as much detail as possible when filling out this form so that PayPal can resolve the issue in a prompt, efficient manner.
 Verify that your information is correct, then click on the "Send" button beneath the contact form to submit your message.


A PayPal customer service representative should reply back to the e-mail address you provided, usually within 1 or 2 business days.
Note that PayPal will only share account information with the account holder, and they will need to verify that you are the account holder before releasing that information.

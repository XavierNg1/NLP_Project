 There are two options for where your broiler might be. In some gas ovens, there will be a drawer below your oven with your broiler inside. In most electric ovens and some gas ovens, there will be a broiling rod at the top of the oven. Take a peek inside your oven and determine the location of your broiler., If your broiler sits inside of a drawer at the bottom of your oven, it may contain a two-tiered broiling pan. If your broiler is in the top of your oven--or if you've misplaced your two-tiered broiling pan--you will need to use something else. A rimmed cookie sheet is a good option. Cover the pan you will use with aluminum foil, and give it a light spritz with non-stick cooking spray.If you have a two-tiered broiling pan, cover both tiers with foil. Cut slits into foil on the top pan to allow any fat or grease to drain.
Do not use glassware. Even reinforced glass--such as Pyrex--can be damaged under such high heat.
 If your broiler sits inside your oven, you will need to make sure that you have a rack in the best position. In general, you will place an oven rack in the highest possible slot, 2-4 inches (5.08 - 10.16 cm) away from the heat source. However, for some recipes (such as broiling certain vegetables or fruit), you may want the rack a bit farther away., Your broiler is a direct heat source that warms up pretty quickly. Turn on your broiler and allow it to heat up for five minutes before you begin cooking your food., Most broilers will have just an "on" or "off" option. But some may also have "high" or "low" settings. In general, keep your broiler set to high and ignore the low setting. If you are using the low setting, you are really just roasting your food, not broiling.

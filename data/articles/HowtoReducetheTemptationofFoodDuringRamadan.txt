 Although watching television isn't prohibited during Ramadan, you may stumble upon food advertisements, example: McDonald's. If you must watch television, make sure that the program you're watching won't feature any food related advertisements and also make sure that what you're watching doesn't contain any prohibited imagery. Example: porn, sexual stimuli, etc. You can watch programs such as cartoons or news.
 The one place in your house where food is just a refrigerator door away is the kitchen. That means no entry and no opening the fridge to indulge in that luscious dairy treat you've been melting for! *hint hint*. The second you enter the kitchen, your intention to fast will be lost faster than your good deeds., What better way to pass the duration of your fast than to pray your five-time a day prayer and read the book of god? This way, you'll be staying away from the temptation of food/bad behavior and at the same time get reward., Doing anything that is objectionable according to the Qur'an is something that displeases Allah S.W.T. Attempt to seek forgiveness for the things you've previously done by making du'aa., Sleeping is possibly the BEST thing for you to do while you're fasting for numerous reasons. Examples: sleeping while fasting means you don't gain sin AND reserve your body energy., Cool off during the hottest time of year by taking a cold shower. You'll feel cool, refreshed and for the most part, being clean is one of the duties of being a good Muslim. You'll also pass more time, avoiding food in the process.

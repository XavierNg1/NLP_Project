 Since a full rotation has 360 degrees, rotating a shape 180 degrees clockwise is the same as rotating 180 counterclockwise.

If the problem states, “Rotate the shape 180 degrees around the origin,” you can assume you are rotating the shape counterclockwise. 

You would complete this problem the same way you complete a problem that asks “Rotate the shape 180 degrees clockwise around the origin.”

You might also see, “Rotate this shape -180 degrees around the origin.” 




, These will likely be given. If not, you should be able to deduce them from looking at the coordinate graph. Remember to note the coordinates of each vertex’s point using the (x, y) convention.

For example, you might have a rhombus with points (4, 6), (-4, 6), (-2, -1), and (2, -1).
 The formula is (x,y)→(−x,−y){\displaystyle (x,y)\rightarrow (-x,-y)}.This formula shows that you are reflecting the shape twice., Take care to plug the correct coordinate into the correct position of the new ordered pair. In this formula, you keep the x and y values in the same position, but you take the negative value of each coordinate.

For example, the points (4, 6), (-4, 6), (-2, -1), and (2, -1) become (-4, -6), (4, -6), (2, 1), and (-2, 1).
 Plot the new vertex points on the plane. Connect your points using a straightedge. The resulting shape shows the original shape rotated 180 degrees around the origin.

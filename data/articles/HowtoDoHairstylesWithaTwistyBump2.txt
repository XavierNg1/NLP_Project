 Get rid of all knots before you continue.
 Grasp a small section of hair close to your hair line. Twist it three times. Bring it up to the crown of your head and push forward slightly to make a bump. Secure this to your crown with bobby pins.
 Gather the rest of your hair to one side and make a low side ponytail, securing it with a hair tie.
 Firmly hold the ponytail and twist it around to form a side chignon. Secure it with plenty of bobby pins.
 Spray over the chignon as well as the twisty bump.

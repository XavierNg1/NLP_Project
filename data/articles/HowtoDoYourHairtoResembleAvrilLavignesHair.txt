 Do you want her dirty blonde and black look, or her platinum blonde look?;
, Avril is always seen with long hair. If you have long hair, keep it a few inches above your waist, with very few layers at the bottom of your hair. If you have short hair, grow it out long.
 If you're going for the black and dirty blonde look, separate your hair into two parts; top and bottom. Dye the bottom part black and the top part almost a dirty blonde. For the platinum blonde look, dye your whole head platinum blonde, except for the front where you can put pink and green in it. If you wanted to be a little different, instead of dying it pink and green, dye the hair your two favorite colors.
 Don't copy Avril's hair to a tee, make it your own. If your want to get some funky layers, or different highlights, do by all means.

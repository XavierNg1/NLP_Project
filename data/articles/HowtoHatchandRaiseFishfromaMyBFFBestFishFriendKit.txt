 It is best to handle the pouch by the string so as not to damage your My BFF embryos.;
, Using a clear 8-12 ounce container, or fish bowl in the deluxe kit, fully submerge the miracle pouch in non-chlorinated, room temperature (64-86°F) water for at least 24 hours. Bottled water is preferred or if using tap water, place it in direct sunlight for at least 2 hours to remove all chlorine from the water; alternatively, a water conditioner from your local pet store can be used. Gently move the pouch around in the water after it has been submerged for 24 hours to encourage any My BFFs that are hiding in the pouch to come out. The miracle pouch can produce up to 8 fish. Allow a day or two to see how many My BFFs have hatched.
 Remove the 2 food cups from Box #2 and fill them with fresh, clean water (as described above). Remove the measuring spoon in your tool kit from Box #4 and pour 1 level spoon of "non iodized" salt into the cups. Remove the small bag of fish food from Box #4. Place a pinch of fish food into the cup of salt water and place the food cups in a warm area - up to 80 °F (27 °C).
 Remove the dropper from Box #4. Once the fish food is ready, you will see the brine shrimp swimming around in the food cup. Use the dropper to collect the brine shrimp from the food cup to feed My BFFs. Feed your My BFFs 2 or 3 droppers full twice or 3 times a day (but 3 or 4 droppers full twice or 3 times a day after 4 weeks). Remove the magnifying glass from Box #4 and use it to watch My BFFs grow, swim and feed

, Wait 1 week after My BFF hatch before changing their water. Thereafter, you will need to change their water every 2-3 days. Remove 2/3 of the old water from their container. Gently add the new water (as specified in Step 2) to your My BFF container.
 Once your My BFFs have grown up to 2 inches (5.1 cm) in length, you can transfer them to an aquarium that holds 5 to 10 gallons (18.9 to 37.9 L) of water. You can then use a small filter or air-stone.

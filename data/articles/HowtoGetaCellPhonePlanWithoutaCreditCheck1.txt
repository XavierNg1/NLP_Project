, Many cell phone companies provide family plans, including T-Mobile, Sprint, AT&T, Verizon, Cricket, and others. Some carriers also let a primary account holder add an “authorized user.”Consider the following as you look at plans:


The number of lines. Some plans let you add up to 10 lines.
Amount of data per line. Some carriers offer unlimited data. You’ll pay more, but often not much more than other plans.Monthly price. Prices vary from $60 to $180 a month.
 The main account holder should contact the carrier to apply for a family plan. They can also add you as an authorized user if you decide to go that route. They should sign up at the carrier’s website. Look for a link to “family plans” at the website.

 Find the fan, and spray it with compressed air. Vents, do the same. The keyboard may also be sprayed with compressed air. If the laptop is really old (more than just a couple of years), you want to do a thorough cleaning job, and you feel comfortable doing this, find a specific manual for the laptop online that shows you how to take it apart (most laptops are different), and spray each component individually. If you do this, you want to make sure you clean certain parts, specifically, the heat sink (fan on the CPU, look for a fan on a chip on the motherboard).;
, Buy some screen cleaner and use a microfiber cloth to clean the screen. Do not spray directly on screen, spray on cloth then wipe til' there isn't anymore solution on the screen.
 Be sure to wipe the whole case to make it more appealing.
 This isn't necessary, but it's a good idea. No one wants to buy a laptop without a power supply.

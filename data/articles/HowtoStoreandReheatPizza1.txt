 Putting a box of pizza straight into the refrigerator will result in soggy pizza. The moisture from the tomato sauce, vegetables and meat will soak through the crust. The thinner the crust, the soggier it will get. Instead, spend a few minutes on storing your pizza the right way.


Line a plate or airtight container with paper towels.
Place the pizza on the paper towels, then cover the pizza with a few paper towels.
Cover the plate with plastic wrap. If you're using an airtight container, put the lid on.;
, Keeping pizza in the refrigerator will cool it down enough so that it won't spoil. It won't alter the texture of the pizza as much as freezing.
 The longer pizza stays in the refrigerator, the soggier it will get. If you want to keep pizza more than two days, you should freeze it. Pack it in an airtight container, not on a plate, with plenty of paper towels. You can keep it in the freezer for a few months.
 Pizza shouldn't go straight from the refrigerator or freezer to the oven. To retain best possible texture, allow it to thaw, first.

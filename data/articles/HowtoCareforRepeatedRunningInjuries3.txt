 Make sure you buy shoes at a running store, where you can talk to people about what your foot needs, because everyone is different.
 These numbers are just averages, though, some shoes last longer and some shorter, so if your shoes no longer feel good, replace them no matter how many miles they have on them.
 It seems simple, but if your shoes are tied too tightly, it can cause multiple problems.

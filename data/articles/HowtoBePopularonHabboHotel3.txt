 You'll just come across as a total "noob". Try spelling like a normal person, and carry out common conversation. Type with proper punctuation and spelling, this can really intimidate people and make them think you're cool.
 Furni means furniture. Bobba is a swear word. Noob is a new Habbo. Hola is a common greeting. Z's often replace S's. HC means Habbo Club. Norm is a person who is NOT in Habbo Club. Your vocabulary will expand as you move on in Habbo. People who don't say "whut iz furni?" often look better than the people who just continue talking than asking a stupid question.

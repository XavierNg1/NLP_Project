 Inline devices attach to your phone's cable and record your calls without requiring placement on the actual phone.
 Plug your telephone line into the appropriate jack on your inline recorder, then plug the recorder's outgoing phone line into your wall jack as though it was a normal phone line.


Find the recorder's audio output cable, and plug it into your audio recording device of choice. Some inline recorders come with a recording device integrated into the unit. If you'd prefer to save a step, buy one of these models. More basic models let you decide what type of audio recorder to use, which may make them more useful for some people.
 Do it just as the conversation begins, and don't forget to start recording if using a separate audio recorder.


Some devices come with a “remote input” feature. These devices will begin to record automatically when there's a call, saving you the trouble.

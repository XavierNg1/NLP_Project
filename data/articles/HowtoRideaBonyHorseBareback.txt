 Some horses, when in pretty good shape, just have naturally bony backs, but if your horse is slightly underweight (which can also cause a protruding backbone), gradually change his feed to help him put on a little more weight.;
, The bony back is really only painful when you're bouncing up and down on it, so the better you are at keeping your backside on the horse, the more enjoyable this will be.
 A bareback pad is a fluffy piece of saddle-shaped cloth that cinches onto your horse, and you can sit on it to cushion yourself. They also offer better grip, and are great for first time bareback riders, and those with bony horses. See the tips and warnings for advice on buying and using a bareback pad.
 It will be easier to adjust to riding your bony horse bareback if you're not also adjusting to riding bareback, too.
 You will definitely notice the difference, but especially if your seat is pretty good, you may be thankful for the backbone as a guide to keep you in the middle of the horse. Simply walk the first time, and you may also try cantering (or loping, if you ride western). The canter is actually more comfortable than the trot when you're riding bareback - you're rocking back and forth instead of bouncing up and down.
 Regardless of how much you've prepared for this, you're likely to be a bit sore and stiff for a day or two. Don't try to ride until you feel a bit better, because trying to avoid the pain when you ride will throw off your balance.
 Once you get used to it, you won't be uncomfortable at all, and just about anything is possible.

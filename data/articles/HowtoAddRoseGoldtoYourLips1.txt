 Choose a pinkish brown lipstick shade that has golden flecks in the formula.You may have to look closely to see the golden flecks, but often the shade name is a good indicator – look for terms like “sunset” and “ginger.” Then layer a basic clear lip gloss on top. This will provide high shine without venturing too far into the metallic side of things.








This is the easiest and most subtle approach. If you’re new to rose gold makeup and want to test the waters, this is a good place to start.;
, Gold lip gloss does, in fact, exist! It’s also surprisingly versatile. The most important thing to look for in a gold lip gloss is a lack of opacity. When you apply the gloss, it should appear to be mostly clear, with gold mica particles visible throughout the formula. The underlying rosy lipstick shade will shine through and the gloss simply provides a golden sheen.








If you want to take it up a notch, look for a more opaque formula. Your rosy lipstick will still be visible beneath it, but there will be a definite metallic edge added that isn’t completely sheer.
It’s not easy to find, but gold lipstick is out there, too. You can layer it with a rose lipstick to get a dramatic effect. Since gold lipstick will be opaque, you’ll need to experiment with layering to get the effect you want.
 When you’re ready to foray into something more metallic, invest in a rose gold lip gloss. This will provide a subtle rose gold sheen to any lipstick you pair it with.The result is luminous but not overly metallic. You can control the overall impact of the look through the shade of lipstick you wear underneath.









For example, a dark rose lipstick under the gloss will appear more substantial, whereas a lighter pink hue will look more shimmery.
You can also control how metallic the look is by limiting (or adding) additional layers of the rose gold lip gloss on top.

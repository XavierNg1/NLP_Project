 Heavy Excel users and others may prefer an external mouse.
 This is probably a mouse from a Windows PC. You may find it not as attractive to have a Windows mouse with your new MacBook, but it is practical. You can also use a Mac-branded option like the Magic Mouse.


The Magic Mouse has a Secondary Click option available in the System Preferences. When enabled, this allows you to right-click just like on any other mouse.
 Plug that mouse into your USB on the Macbook or connect via Bluetooth, and you are good to go.

 Using your dominant hand, grip onto the deck of cards. Your thumb, middle, and ring finger should be holding the deck by its edges., Slide out a portion of the cards from the middle of the deck with your other hand. Once you've separated the middle portion, lay those cards flat on the table while still keeping the other two halves separated by your fingers and thumb.Try to hide the break as much as possible, so people don't know you're doing a false cut.
 With the cards still separated by your thumb and index fingers, peel off the top portion of cards and lay them on top of the cards you put on the table. All of the cards on the table will still be in order, but if done fast enough, will look like you've already cut the deck., Use your thumb to keep the deck separated as you lay the last portion of cards onto the deck on the table. Keeping them separated will allow you to do the last move and finish your false cut., Now take your free hand and pull the bottom portion of the deck out from the cards on the table and put them on the top of your other pile of cards. The cards will now be in the original order, but it will look like you split them multiple times.

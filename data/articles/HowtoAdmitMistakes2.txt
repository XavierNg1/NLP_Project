 If you can't tell them, at least talk to a close friend.;
, For example, say: "I'm sorry I started that rumor. It was a really hurtful and childish thing to do."

, For example, say: "I'm sorry that I've ignored your opinion. I see now that I really hurt your feelings."


Only apologize if you are sincerely sorry. An insincere apology will hurt the other person more.
 For example, say: "If I had known that Jane Doe had the problem under control, I wouldn't have gotten involved and created that mess."


If it's a minor mistake, or not very serious, make a joke about the incident. It shows that you're comfortable with yourself and can get over minor difficulties. For example, say: "Next time we have an important client, I'll have to have cheat cards like a newscaster. Then I'll remember to get the names right!"
Look around and watch people who turn their gaffes into humorous stories or successful anecdotes. These people tend to be relaxed, self-assured and very likeable because they can see the funny or less serious side of their mistakes.
 For example, say: "That was really foolish of me. Next time I see a situation like that, I'll ask for details instead of jumping to conclusions."

, Depending on the situation, the other person may take time to get back to you. And when they do, don't try to rearrange their understanding of the situation. Listen to how they perceived your actions, words or involvement.
 Be bold and move on. Either the person will accept your admission or they won't but you need to get on with life. Dwelling on what happened or trying to force an outcome never makes things better. Cease the fretting and trying too hard and simply let things be.

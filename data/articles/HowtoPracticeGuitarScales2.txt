 These three scales are, far and away, the most useful scales you can learn, and they are the easiest. Almost every other scale is some variation on these three scales, and the pentatonic scale -- the most common rock and blues guitar scale -- is itself just a variation on the minor scale. The following diagrams in the key of A, and are written in guitar tab. This means that the number represents the fret you need to play, and the line represents each string.



Minor Pentatonic Scale: If you're playing modern music, the pentatonic scale will almost always suffice. If you want to start soloing quickly, this is the one to get down.

e|---------------------5-8-------------|
|B|-----------------5-8-----------------
G|-------------5-7---------------------|
D|---------5-7-------------------------|
A|-----5-7-----------------------------|
E|-5-8---------------------------------|Major Scale: This is the basis of all major chords. It is bright and happy, and absolutely essential to know for music theory, but it is usually adapted when used in solos or leads:

e|---------------------------4-5-|
B|-----------------------5-7-----|
G|-----------------4-6-7---------|
D|-----------4-6-7---------------|
A|-----4-5-7---------------------|
E|-5-7---------------------------|



Minor Scale: The basis for all minor chords, it has a darker, sadder feel. Like the major scale, most players adapt it for solos, but it is still essential for a guitarist to know:

e|-----------------------------5-7-8-|
B|-----------------------5-6-8-------|
G|-----------------4-5-7-------------|
D|-------------5-7-------------------|
A|-------5-7-8-----------------------|
E|-5-7-8-----------------------------, Start off with the basic pentatonic scale. Play each one at the pace where you can play all the notes without mistakes, and slowly speed up the pace once you get better. Always play the scale backward after playing it forwards. Don't try and create any variations now, just get used to playing all the notes, in order, front to back.


You want to play slowly enough that you don't make mistakes. You don't want to reinforce bad habits when you first start learning.
 To really crush your scales, you need to be able to play them to a beat. A simple metronome is a great way to keep you on time and to measure your progress. Do not, however, speed the machine up until you can comfortably play the scale up and down without mistakes.


You can get free metronome apps on your phone, or find them online.
Remember -- practicing scales is about technique. It may feel boring now, but you'll notice the benefits once you start using the scales for solos and licks.
 Almost all the scales that you learn are actually "scale forms." This means that, without any extra movement, you can move them up and down the neck to put the scale in a new key. For example, the most common pentatonic scale to learn is A-Minor, where you start on the third fret. But, if the song is in E-Minor, all you have to do is make the first note an E, then play the same basic structure.


Learning the notes of the guitar is essential to becoming a great soloist.
Play the scales across the neck, not just in the same place.
For guidance, check out this tab of every single major scale along with the corresponding key., Whenever you watch great guitarists, you'll notice that they rarely stay in the same place on the guitar the entire time they solo. They move up and down, and while it seems to be at random, they know exactly where to go. This is because they understand the "intervals," which are the distances between two notes. While one could delve into interval theory for months, one basic pattern will help you expand your scale on every string across the whole neck:



Step Theory: Starting on your root note (the A in an A-Minor), you could play the whole scale on one string. Simply remember W-H-W-W-H-W-W. This is the distance between notes: W stands for whole-step (2 frets) and H stands for half-step (1 fret).

Try playing the whole minor scale on one string like this. Every note you play on this string could be used in a solo.


As you get better, test out new notes to the left and right of your scale. Can you play a whole "solo" without touching your normal scale?, Scales can be found on websites such as All Guitar Chords, or Guitar Scales. You should remember, however, that it is better to master 2-3 scales then to know 30 scales in pieces. Before moving on, make sure you can play the three basics scales outlined above across the entire guitar. It not only helps you play over almost anything, it will make learning new scales easier.Modes are variations, adding and subtracting notes, on the major and minor scale. They follow a series of rules that makes them coherent and pleasing to the ear.

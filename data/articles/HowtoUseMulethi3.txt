Place in a pot, cover with water, and simmer for at least an hour.

Put in jars while still very hot.

Or for an even more powerful taste, add a dash of licorice powder to your cup of joe., You can add powdered licorice straight to recipes. It works particularly well in meat rubs, and pairs well with pigeon, duck, quail, pork, and lamb., Licorice is a powerful flavor, so you'll want to make it the star ingredient in sweets.

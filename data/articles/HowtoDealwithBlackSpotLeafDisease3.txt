 Research the type of tree or plant that you wish to include in your landscape. Find out if any particular variety has been proven to be resistant to the disease.If the cost of resistant varieties is significantly higher than non-resistant ones, ask yourself which you value more: saving money now or time and labor later.
 Whenever you plant new saplings or young plants, picture the size they’ll reach once fully grown. Plant them accordingly, allowing each plenty of distance from the rest in the future.Preempt the easy spread of disease by keeping one plant from touching another once they’ve matured. Allow sunlight to reach and dry the lower leaves throughout their lifetime by eliminating the excessive shade that overcrowded canopies would otherwise provide.


Cover the soil around newly planted areas with mulch. This will absorb water and keep the disease from splashing up into the leaves when it rains.
 Since moisture facilitates black spot disease, plant in areas that dry easily after rain. Choose spots that receive direct sunlight for at least a portion of the day.Keep clear of areas that are prone to standing water.


Also adjust any lawn sprinklers so they don’t soak your leaves unnecessarily.

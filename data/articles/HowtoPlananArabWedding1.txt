 The reception hall is crucial and must be reserved at least six months in advance. When looking for the perfect hall, size is the most important factor. A hall should be large enough to fit anywhere between 500 to 1,500 people. Décor is simply extra and not viewed as a main priority.


You should anticipate extra people coming to your wedding and take into consideration the seating arrangements. For example, you should make sure the hall employees are lenient and ready to add additional tables as guests arrive, if necessary.;
, The parents and grandparents of the bride and groom should do the guest lists. The bride and groom should never compose the official or entire wedding guest list alone. It may be risky, as many elder relatives and family friends will take great offense to being overlooked or not viewed as a priority guest. In essence, the bride and groom’s wedding party is really a formal gathering held by the bride and groom’s parents, and most of the guests that arrive may even be strangers to the bride and groom.
 The invitation cards are the party’s first impression, the fancier, the better. People begin to imagine how simple or extravagant the wedding will be, based on how much money and effort went into making the invitations. Usually, a smaller, empty envelope is enclosed in the larger envelope, along with the invitation, so people can leave money as wedding gifts to help start the bride and groom’s financial funds.

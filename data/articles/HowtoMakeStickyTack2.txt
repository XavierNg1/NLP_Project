 You'll need 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of white glue (also called school glue) and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of liquid starch, the kind that's used to starch shirts. These ingredients will give you a small batch of sticky tack. If you want a larger batch, just remember to use the ratio of 2 parts glue and 1 part starch.
 Put them in a container and use a spoon to mix them together. The mixture will immediately begin to stiffen, due to the interaction between the glue and starch. Soon it will form the consistency of sticky tack.
 Use blue or another fun color to color your sticky tack if you'd like. Add just a few drops, since a little goes a long way. Stir it in so that the ball of sticky tack gets thoroughly colored.
 Scoop the sticky tack into your hands and knead it so that it becomes firm, but pliable. If you think it feels a little sticky, work in a little more starch. If it's too dry to stick, add a bit more glue. Keep working the sticky tack until it reaches the consistency you want.
 Pinch of a few small pieces to hang a poster or picture. You can store the sticky tack you don't use in an airtight jar or another container. If it gets a little dry before you use it again, you can add more glue and work it in with your hands to achieve the right texture again.

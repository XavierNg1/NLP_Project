 Be on the hunt for songs that are very appealing to your ears.;
, What does the song symbolize? What could it mean? Think long and hard about how you should interpret it.
, What would fit? Brainstorm for as long as possible.
 Does it play out nicely? What can you do to improve it?

, Work through it as a process. Is it too long? Too short? Fix whatever needs fixing, and add or deduct parts you feel don't belong.
 You need to have 100% faith that you're doing a good job.
 This could take a while, so have patience.
 Are you completely satisfied with the result? If so, upload it to the Internet for your fans to see.

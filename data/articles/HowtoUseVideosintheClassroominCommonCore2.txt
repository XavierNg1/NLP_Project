Any student can benefit from videos, but it is common to find videos to help students that are going faster or slower than the rest of the class.  Students with learning difficulties may benefit as well.
Ensure no jealousy from other students.  Some students may resent others looking at videos, so try to combat this from the get-go by providing some opportunities for all students to access engaging material. The time spent on videos does not have to be even from student to student, but giving everyone at least a little time with video instruction can help combat jealousy.
  Ensure technology is not an issue.


If you already have iPads or Chromebooks in your classroom, you won't need to worry.
If you borrow some devices, ensure they comply with school rules.   Most districts have policies about what websites are appropriate for students to use, and which are not.
 Ensure there is no distraction.  You may consider headphones to avoid excessive noise in the classroom. Some schools will let kids use computers in their library.
  Giving students technology can be a double edged sword: Students may take advantage and end up playing a video game instead of doing the video assignment. Providing adequate supervision is key to success.


iPads and Chromebooks are cheaper than regular computers, but can disappear easily.

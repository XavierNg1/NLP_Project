 Pay attention to what kinds of plants draw his attention, then avoid plants like that in the future.


For example, your cat might love wispy, dangling leaves that flutter in the breeze.
In that case, buy plants with large, heavy leaves that don't look as much fun to play with.
 Yucca plants, for example, seem to be particularly irresistible, and your cat will chew on them without mercy. Zinnias and marigolds are other examples of "cat magnet" plants that you should avoid.If you already have an irresistible plant in your home, keep on a high shelf where the cat can't reach it. Make sure it's an unreachable shelf, or your nimble cat might just leap up there.
 Place trays of catnip or grass around your home for your cat. Munching on these plants will help satisfy his need to chew, and hopefully distract him from your more prized plants.
 There are also some plant species that cats just can't seem to stomach. They often have a strong smell, like lavender, rosemary, or citrus plants. While you can enjoy the pleasant aroma of these plants, the smell will discourage your cat from chomping on them.


You might also buy plants that have very high leaves that cats canâ€™t reach, such as small trees.

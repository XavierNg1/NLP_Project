 When your child sees you be aggressive, they begin to think that those behaviors are acceptable. Instead of yelling at your child, you should do your best to keep a calm and even tone. Spanking is often seen as an ineffective way of handling aggressive children because it teaches children to hit someone that they are upset with.Instead of spanking or yelling, you should talk to your child about the incident in a firm, respectful tone and, if need be, remove them from the situation.
Limit the amount of time that your child is allowed to spend with aggressive or emotionally unstable people. The longer that your child is exposed to the behavior, the more normal it seems.
When your child is young, limit their exposure to aggressive or violent games, movies, and television.
 As you minimize aggressive tendencies, you will have to show your child another option. By letting them see you interact with kindness and respect, you will set the expectation that they do the same. Make it a point to show them how you resolve conflicts without hitting.For example, you could say something to your child like, “Watch how we talk to each other when we are upset.”

, Your child will build their behaviors around how you treat others, and how you treat them. If you regularly address your child with frustration and anger, they will mimic that behavior. Talk to them in a soft, kind tone and acknowledge their feelings. If you get frustrated, you can take a minute to calm down before talking to your child.Instead of saying something like “What is wrong with you,” you could ask your child, “How are you feeling right now?”

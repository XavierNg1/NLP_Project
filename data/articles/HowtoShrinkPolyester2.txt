 Set the washing machine to the hottest water setting and the longest wash cycle. Use a hot wash and a hot rinse setting., Immediately after the washing cycle finishes, pull the polyester garment from the washing machine and transfer it to an ironing board. Make sure that the garment is still inside-out to reduce the risk of fading., Make sure the cloth completely covers your garment. This will prevent the iron from damaging your clothing.
 Using a lower setting will prevent the polyester from becoming too stiff. Pass the iron over your article of clothing. Continue ironing the garment until it is completely dried.


Do not use a steam setting on the iron. A dry iron will dry out the polyester as you pass over it, which is the effect you’re looking for.
 Make sure not to repeat the ironing process, as this could damage the polyester and cause colors to fade.If you’ve already put the garment through more than one washing and drying cycles, as well as ironing it, you’ve likely shrunk it much as you can.

 You will be needing 2 1/2 cups (or enough to fill a cake pan of choice) of chopped, mixed fruit or 1 can of canned fruit salad or fruit cocktail. Fruits good for this include: pineapple, mango, papaya, and cherries. Or, you can substitute fruits depending on your location.
 You may want to use a mortar and pestle for this, but any type of pounding utensil is good.
 Follow the instructions that come with the jello package. The traditional color is clear, but you can use other colors.
 Make sure that there is enough to cover the bottom in an even layer. It should be about 1⁄3 inch (0.8 cm) in thickness at the least.
, The idea is that you want the jello to mix with the fruits, without disturbing the layer of graham crackers.
 Since condensed milk is very sweet and sometimes used as a substitute for sugar, you should use it sparingly, and only for flavor.
 This should take about an hour, but you want to leave it there as long as possible in order to get it to be somewhat stable.


It's a good idea to cover the cake with plastic food wrap or a lid before placing in the refrigerator.

 A loose top will allow all the pressure you build up pumping your mister to escape. Without pressure, your mister cannot spray. When your mister isn't misting, first check to see the top is firmly and snugly attached.


In some cases, a rubber o-ring on the underside of your top or at the top of the mister's base may have become twisted, forming an imperfect seal. Use your fingers to smooth all seals to the top of the mister., In some cases, your nozzle may have been knocked askew. This can cause the line from the mister base to the nozzle to be obstructed. Use your fingers to gently check the nozzle, and:


If the nozzle is simply out of place, use your fingers to adjust the nozzle until it returns to its proper position.
If the nozzle appears bent or similarly out of place, apply firm, moderate pressure to realign the nozzle.
If the nozzle cannot be returned to its proper position, the damage to your mister may be irreparable.
 Depending on your brand of oil mister, the proper cleaning procedure may vary. Generally, to clean your oil mister, fill its base with warm, soapy water, then reassemble the mister. Allow it to sit for 20 minutes or so, then:


Take apart the mister, dump out the soapy water, and rinse the mister thoroughly with warm water.
Refill the base of the mister with warm water. Prime your mister to spray, then spray the mister as you would normally.
Continue priming and spraying water through your mister until the water is emitted in a fine mist., Over time, the pump mechanism of your mister may wear down and pump less efficiently or not at all. In these cases, you'll either have to replace the pump or buy a new mister.


For some models of mister, you may be able to buy replacement parts on its company's product webpage.

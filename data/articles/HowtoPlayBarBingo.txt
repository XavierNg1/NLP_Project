, It's up to you to use the same keywords on every card or have different cards say other terms. This is useful when lots of terms are built up or allow people to have the opportunity to find different things from others.
 Make sure that everyone has enough time so that they know what they're looking for beforehand., Make sure to tell them that in order to claim a keyword, they need to take a picture of it on their phone in the bar. Without a valid picture, the item on the board does not count.
 You can have everyone go out for an hour or two, just enough to speculate and enjoy themselves or bar hop. Call or text another party when cards are completed before the time limit is up.
 Once a person's card is completely blacked out first, then a winner can be declared. Depending on the complexity of the keywords, people can complete a standard Bingo row or column (up, down, or diagonal).

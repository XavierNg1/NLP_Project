 ALWAYS wash your face before you leave the house, it'd be very embarrassing to approach someone with dried toothpaste on your face.;
, Make sure your clothes are stain free, wrinkle free and without any stinky odors. For men, makes sure your pants are where they're supposed to be, on or above your waste, sagging only makes you look like a slob and that's a turn off to most women. For Women, make sure your tops don't show too much cleavage, I'm pretty sure you don't want the guy getting distracted.
, Having good manners can get you far with the opposite sex. Please do not use profanity or unnecessary words like gay or retarded, you might offend the person you're talking to.
 Make sure you aren't slumping when you walk. Always keep a straight back and a warm smile on your face when you're walking towards them.
 This is a huge part to having a successful conversation with the opposite sex. Start with a nice greeting:Hi, Hello, etc. Introduce yourself in a nice manner and if you think that person may be up to it, offer a handshake. Ask them how they're doing and really listen when they tell you. A great way to start a nice conversation is to ask them what kind of music they like, then moving on to movies, books, TV shows or even magazines, depending on the subject. Make sure you make eye-contact when speaking, it's a sign that you're listening and that you're interested in what they're saying. Another very important thing is knowing when to stop talking. Always give the other person a chance to reply.
 Knowing how to end a conversation is just as important as knowing how to start one. Thank them for their time or for them talking to you and that you enjoyed it.

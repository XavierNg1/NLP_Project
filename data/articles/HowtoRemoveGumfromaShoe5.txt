 This method works well if you're outside and happen to step on some fresh gum that is still pretty soft and pliable. All you need is some dry sand (or dirt) and a small wooden stick.
 Remove your shoe and sprinkle some sand on top of the gum. Use the stick to start rubbing the sand into the gum -- it should start coming away in small chunks.
 As the gum starts to come away, sprinkle some more sand on top and continue rubbing. The sand acts kind of like an exfoliator for the bottom of your shoe!









Keep going until the gum is more or less completely removed. This may take a little while, but it's better to act quickly instead of allowing the gum to dry and harden onto your shoe.

 It is easy to get into an everyday routine of accomplishing personal goals. However, you should strive to spend time with your partner to continue to build healthy and happy habits. Some ways to do this include:


Eating dinner together.
Sharing a hobby.
Working out together.
Going to bed/waking up at the same time.
Schedule time during the day to sit down and talk. (Maybe after the both of you get home from work.)

, Try and take an interest in partner’s interests. This can be a hobby, or this can just being present and supportive of what your partner does. For example:


If your partner enjoys playing/watching a sport, then support the team or watch her games.
If your partner enjoys an activity, try the activity with him. Or, ask questions and encourage discussions about it.
 This may seem counter-productive to building a healthy partnership, but studies have shown the couples are happier if they develop some personal time.To develop some alone time, try:


Having a space designated as your own.
Scheduling time for your own. (For example, perhaps every other Saturday is your own day.)
Have your own hobby. While it is important to share your partner’s interest, it can also be healthy to have a unique hobby that you can enjoy by yourself. For example, perhaps take an exercise class by yourself.
 Enjoy your time with your spouse. Remember important dates like birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays. Do something you both enjoy to mark the good things in life.


There are many ways of celebrating. You can take your spouse out to a nice dinner at her favorite restaurant or stay at home and make your husband his favorite dinner. You can take a vacation or stay at home and enjoy a “staycation.” Celebrate in a way that you both enjoy.

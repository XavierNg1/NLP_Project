 Skeletron is a bit harder than the previous bosses. Make sure you have:

A Clock
Powerful levitation devices
Ranged weapons
Meteor Armor
A Space Gun
Mana restoring potions

, Set up a clock at the entrance and wait until it's almost night.

The Clock is there so you can keep track of time. If you haven't beaten Skeletron by dawn, he will instantly kill you.


Since the entrance to the Dungeon is a little cramped, you might want to battle on top of it.
 It has unlimited ammo, but does consume Manna, so be careful.

Aim for Skeletron's hands. Once they had been destroyed, shoot at his head.
Be sure to constantly move.
 Once he is defeated, you get several perks:

You can now enter the Dungeon without being slaughtered by Dungeon Guardians.
You can now gain the Clothier NPC, who will provide you will stylish new clothes. More on that here.

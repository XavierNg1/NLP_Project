 When dodo meat is raw, it can be eaten but it isn't as effective at restoring hunger and health as cooked dodo meat is.
 Cook over a campfire - tap on the dodo meat, then add to the fire:

Make sure you have dodo meat in your inventory.






Tap on the campfire of choice.






Tap on the dodo meat icon.






Press "Craft".






Your Blockhead character will prepare the dodo meat over the campfire. The status bar will show you how quickly the meat is being prepared. (Note that the fuel amounts will gradually reduce, so you may wish to add more fuel to that campfire when the meat is cooked.)







, Eat it as outlined above, when your Blockhead character is very hungry.

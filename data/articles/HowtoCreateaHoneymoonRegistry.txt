 Before you can ask your wedding guests for contributions, you must first be able to explain what they are contributing to. Research locations, flights, accommodations and tourist attractions in order to create a detailed description of your honeymoon vacation, from start to finish.;
, Whichever site you choose, you will be guided through the process of registering, then setting up your registry account, and then will be given a unique URL for your registry's webpage. You will have to provide contact information for you and your fiancé, wedding information and details about the honeymoon.
, You will do this from the web page your site of choice assigns to you.


Provide visuals. This endears your page visitors to your wish-list, and makes it more tangible to them. Upload images associated with the items you are requesting in your honeymoon gift registry if you can't find images of the items themselves.
List items at a variety of price-points. Honeymoon registries should be accessible to all wedding guests � even those who cannot afford to spend a lot of money on a gift. Think of every detail of your honeymoon when creating your list of wanted items, and include them in your registry. For example, you may have everything on your list from a bottle of wine to a first-class plane ticket.
Incorporate details. For the same reason you need to provide visuals, you also need to describe your desired gifts in vivid detail. Instead of asking for a "dinner for two," describe the charming beachside restaurant where you envision a romantic evening sharing a bowl of crab bisque with your new spouse.

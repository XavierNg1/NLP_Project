 To prepare your tomato plants to be transferred outdoors, start your seedlings indoors while it is still cold outside. Cool temperatures in early spring can stunt growth or even kill young seedlings. Start your seedlings indoors to improve your production chances.
 You can find these pots at your local nursery or garden supply store.
 For example, one mix could be made using 1/3 peat moss, 1/3 coarse vermiculite, and 1/3 compost. Just make sure to water it before you sow your seeds.
 Cover with soil and pat down lightly.
 When the seeds germinate, move them into full sun or under grow lights.
 When you start to see sprouts, you can water less frequently. More plants are killed by too much water (that rots the roots) than too little water so water sparingly after the plants sprout.


You can also soak the seeds flat in water, so the roots are watered from the bottom up. Misting may not get enough water to the roots.
 Once the plants peek out of the soil, they will grow pretty fast.

 You can protect your rabbit and help prevent GI stasis by learning how the rabbit’s digestive system works. The rabbit’s digestive system has developed to eat very fibrous plants. These are plants which humans could never digest but rabbits thrive on.The rabbits use their teeth to grind the fibrous plants down to make them small enough for the rabbit’s digestive tract to digest.


This type of food is typically coarse and rough to help wear down the rabbit’s teeth. Their teeth grow continuously throughout the life of the rabbit.If the food doesn’t perform this function, the teeth will grow long and ragged, potentially injuring the rabbit.
 As the food travels down the digestive tract from the mouth, it is held in the relatively large stomach. Rabbits are crepuscular, meaning they eat primarily at dusk and dawn, so their food has to be stored in the stomach for hours. In the stomach, the food is mixed with enzymes and acids before it is passed along to the small intestine.In the small intestine, most of the digestion and absorption of nutrients occur as the food travels along this part of the digestive tract.
 The small intestine empties into the large intestine and the cecum. The cecum further digests the fibrous portion of the plants the rabbit consumed.This is then passed out of the body via the large intestine and anus. When it does, the rabbit eats it to recover the nutrients produced by the bacteria and microorganism in the cecum.The cecum is filled with bacteria and microorganisms which break down plant fibers to make the nutrients locked inside available to the rabbit’s body.
When the fibers are broken down, the cecum releases all the nutrients and material into the large intestine in sticky substance called a cecotrope.

 Many good guard dogs are brought up within the family from a young age. This allows them to bond with their families so that they can protect them later in life. If you have identified a specific breed that you want, see if there are any local breeders. Contact them, and ask if they will have any litters of puppies available for adoption soon.


Puppies bought at puppy stores are often sourced from puppy mills. You should look for a responsible breeder who has certifications and recommendations from a recognized kennel club., You do not necessarily need a purebred puppy to have a good guard dog. You may be able to find one at a shelter or rescue organization instead. Visit various shelters in your area to see if they have a suitable dog.


When you visit, let the volunteers or workers know that you want a guard dog. Ask them if they know of any good candidates.
Some rescue organizations are breed specific. This means that you may be able to adopt a purebred rescue at a much lower cost than buying a puppy from a breeder.
 Sometimes military or police dogs are retired because they can longer perform their duties, but that does not mean that they cannot stop working entirely. These dogs are often already trained for security purposes. You can contact a service dog rescue organization to see if there are any good candidates available.You can look at:


The Military Working Dog School

Mission K9 Rescue
United States War Dogs Association
Keep in mind that some working dog rescue organizations may want you to sign a contract stating that you will not use these dogs for security work.

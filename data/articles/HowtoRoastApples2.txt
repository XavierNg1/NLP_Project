, Use a vegetable brush to scrub the skins, then pat them dry with a towel. Any type of apples will work, but Rome Beauty, Golden Delicious, or Jonagold apples are all great whole roasting apples. Their flesh bakes into a soft, smooth treat you can scoop with a spoon., Use either an apple corer or a paring knife to remove the cores and hollow out the apples. Don't cut all the way through, though. Keep the bottoms intact, since you're going to fill the apples with the remaining ingredients.


If you're using a paring knife, make four deep slices around the stem of the apples. Use a spoon to scoop out the core and seeds.
If you accidentally cut through the bottom of an apple, simply reinsert the bottom piece to block the bottom of the hole.
 Evenly distribute the brown sugar and cinnamon among the four apples. Use a spoon to fill up the center of the apples with the mixture. If desired, add a pinch of salt and a squirt of lemon juice to each one.
 Evenly distribute the butter cubes among the four apples. Drop the cubes directly into the holes so that they rest on top of the sugar mixture.
 Pour the hot water into the bottom of a baking dish. This will help the apples roast evenly. Arrange the apples so that they're standing upright in the baking dish.
 Check the apples with a fork. When they are ready they should be tender, but not mushy. Remove the apples from the oven and allow them to cool for a few minutes.
 Each apple makes a single dessert for one person. Serve the apples with ice cream or whipped cream.

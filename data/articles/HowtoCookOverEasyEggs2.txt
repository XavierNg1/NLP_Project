 This method allows you to get over easy eggs without having to flip them, making it perfect if you've had problems with flipping in the past. The first few steps are exactly the same as in the traditional method. See below:









Heat cooking fat (butter, grease, etc.) in a pan over medium or medium-low heat.
Crack the eggs into a separate container before transferring them to the hot pan.
Tilt the pan to gather the eggs at one end. Once they set, lower the pan flat and let them cook for about one to two minutes.
 Pour a tablespoon of water per egg into the edge of the pan. Cover it with a good-fitting lid. The water will turn into steam and cook the top side of the egg. This will give you the characteristic film over the yolk that over easy eggs are known for without any flipping.









If you're cooking on a flat griddle instead of a pan, pour the water right next to the egg, then set a raised lid over both the egg and the water. The lid will hold the steam next to the egg.
 Steaming doesn't cook the top sides of the eggs as quickly as contact with the pan, so you'll need to allow a little extra cooking time. The eggs are cooked to over easy when they're covered with a thin white film but the yolks are still liquid.









Be sure to reduce the heat to low hear to prevent the bottoms of the eggs from over-cooking from the heat of the pan.
If, after a minute or two, the eggs don't seem cooked, try turning off the heat and letting the residual heat warm them a little longer., You don't need to flip the eggs a second time with this method. Simply remove the lid (carefully, as to avoid steam burns) and transfer the eggs to a plate.

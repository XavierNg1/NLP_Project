 Before you can properly dress a wound or scab, it should be dry. If your wound is oozing blood, place some sterile gauze on it. If it soaks through the gauze, don’t remove it. Just place another layer of gauze on top.Keep the gauze in place until the wound stops oozing.;
, Even if your wound has already started to scab over, it’s important to keep it clean. This helps it heal faster. Wash the site with soap and warm water, then rinse. Lightly pat it dry., While old ways assumed that keeping a scab dry helped it heal faster, modern research says keeping it moist is best. Slather a layer of petroleum jelly all over and around the scab after you have cleaned it.You can also use antibacterial ointment instead of petroleum jelly, but this isn’t necessary for most wounds.
 Immediately after moistening the scab, cover it in a sterile adhesive bandage (band-aid or plaster). You can also use silicone gel sheets (look for these at a pharmacy), or gauze wrap, especially if you’re dealing with a big scab., While you’re waiting for the scab to heal, take time to remove the bandage each day and clean the site. Moisten the scab again and cover it with a new bandage.The scab still won’t disappear instantly, but this will definitely speed up the healing process.

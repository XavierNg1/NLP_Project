 Determine the placement of the blinds' headrail over the window.









Pick a point under the window, but near the center, where you want the bottom of the blinds to reach.
From that point, measure the height of the blinds up to the top of the window and make a pencil mark.
 You'll need a helper for this step.









Have a helper place the headrail directly on the pencil mark, while you check that's it's straight with a level.
Measure 4 inches (10 cm) from the end of the headrail and make a pencil mark directly over the headrail.
Repeat on the other end for the second bracket.
If installing vertical blinds wider than 62 inches (1.5 m), mark the positioning of the additional support brackets provided.
 If the brackets are being attached to drywall rather than a wood frame around the window, drill a hole and insert wall anchors first.
 Hook the headrail onto the brackets.
 If you don't know how, follow the instruction in the section on attaching the vanes later in the article.
 Add a valance, if you want one and one was included.









Push the corners onto either end of the front piece of the valance, and then attach the side pieces.
Snap the provided clips along the headrail.
Slide the valance into the clips.

 Administering a coffee enema can have adverse health risks, including colitis,septicemia,, and rectal burns due to the temperature of the coffee. There have even been reports of coffee-enema-related deaths., Despite holistic rumors a coffee enema is unlikely to have significant effects. The caffeine absorption from a coffee enema is far less than drinking coffee, and it has a negligible effect on blood pressure and heart rate.While limited use may not be harmful to every user, the benefits appear to be minimal.
 If you are considering a coffee enema, talk to your doctor about it first. It is likely that your physician will advise against the treatment, but she may be able to offer alternatives or to give you additional information about your prognosis. Other health and lifestyle changes may have a greater effect on your wellbeing with fewer risks.

 You can completely disable Siri on your iPhone, but this will enable the Voice Control feature, which may give you the same problems you were having originally.
 This will open the Siri menu.
 This will disable Siri on your iPhone, but will enable the Voice Control feature. You cannot disable both Voice Control and Siri at the same time.


Tap "Disable Siri" to confirm that you want to turn it off.
 Siri stores information used to respond to your requests on the Apple servers. This information is also used for the Dictation feature (voice to text), and this will need to be disabled as well if you want to completely remove the data from Apple's servers. Turning Dictation off will disable the microphone button on your device's on-screen keyboard, but not remove it.


Return to the "General" section of the Settings app and select "Keyboard."
Scroll to the bottom of the screen and toggle "Enable Dictation" OFF. You'll be asked to confirm that you want to turn Dictation off.

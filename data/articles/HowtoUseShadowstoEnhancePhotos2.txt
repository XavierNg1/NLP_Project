 Blank white paper positioned to the side of the photograph can "paint" the light onto an area of the subject. This emphasis will increase the contrast between well-lit and shadowed areas, resulting in a more dramatic photograph.

In portraiture, the most common goals of reflecting light are to emphasize cheek bones, soften lips, sharpen the eyes, and wash out potentially sensitive areas (wrinkles and acne).
 Too much light from above may cast shadows over the eyes, or under the nose where it can cause the subject's nose to appear larger. If you notice these signs, adjust the lighting until you have a more flattering shadow placement., Position a single, hard light source to one side of the subject, a bit higher than eye level.The goal is to brightly illuminate one half of his face, as well as a triangle on the opposite cheekbone. The shadow of the nose then obscures the rest of that cheek., Careful positioning of objects and light sources can create shadows that meet to form patterns or shapes. Two screws standing upright can form a triangle when their shadows meet. A ring balanced on a book's inner spine casts a heart-shaped shadow on the curved pages beneath.


It's often easier to start with a mental image and work towards that goal. That said, sometimes experimenting with object placement leads to serendipitous shots.

 It will take longer or shorter depending on how high your Pokémon's level is at. A Lv5 Squirtle will take much longer to train than a Lv80 Blastoise. The Blastoise might take about 5:00 to 7:00 hours of playing time to get it to the "golden level". As for the Squirtle, it will take about 48:00.
 This is important, because choosing the moves will determine how effectively your Pokémon battles. A Pokémon may either be taught moves with TMs (technical machines), HMs ( Hidden Machines), or it will learn a move on its own.
 This is the most obvious technique. Battling against other Pokémon boosts exp. The stronger the Pokémon you beat, the more exp. your Pokémon gains. If your Pokémon is at level 80 or above, the Elite Four is a great place to train. Deposit all Pokémon except the one you wish to train and battle the Elite Four. You will probably lose (don't use items) but you will make back the money you lost and your Pokémon will train very fast.
 The Vs Seeker will let you battle trainers you have already battled, which is a great way to level up your Pokémon and become richer.

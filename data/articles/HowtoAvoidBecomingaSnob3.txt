 Psychologists believe that those who share their awards, achievements and thoughts of superiority are often in search of approval by others. Make your accomplishments desirable to you and set them inline with your overall life, career and relationship goals.It may not easy to remind yourself of what makes you great, but don’t forget about all your awesome qualities.
Wear what makes you truly happy and do things that you fully enjoy. As you fill your life with more joy, you’ll be happier and more confident in yourself.
 Don’t compare yourself to others and the experiences they have had or things they own.


Write down or recite three things that you’re grateful for each morning before you get out of bed. Repeating these positive things can help instill a better sense of self-esteem and happiness.
 Don’t allow others to significantly influence your decision making. When you make an important decision, think it through thoroughly and feel confident and proud in the outcome.
 Anything you force yourself to do because of someone else shouldn’t be a regular part of your life. Eliminate things you do just to please others.Each month go over what you did the previous month and what you have planned for the next. Eliminate anything that didn’t make you happy in the previous month, and anything that you’re hesitant about in the upcoming month.

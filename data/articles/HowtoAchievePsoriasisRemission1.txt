 If you have been unable to get your psoriasis in remission, make an appointment with your doctor. Your doctor can suggest medication and lifestyle changes that may help reduce your symptoms and help your psoriasis go into remission.


Finding the right treatment is pivotal to achieving remission. You have a better chance of getting proper treatment if you are working closely with your doctor.;
, Topical creams or lotions are usually the first medical treatment a doctor will recommend. You can get some topical treatments over-the-counter, and others can be prescribed by your doctor.Corticosteroids are a common topical treatment for psoriasis because they reduce the inflammation of lesions.
 Phototherapy is a treatment for psoriasis that shines sunlight or ultraviolet light on your skin. The process is conducted under medical supervision in a doctor’s office or clinic. After discussing with your doctor, you can also do the treatments at home with an at-home phototherapy unit.One type of phototherapy uses psoralen, a medication that makes you more sensitive to certain kinds of UV light. This is used with certain types of psoriasis, like plaque or guttate psoriasis.
Laser treatments can be used for localized psoriasis.
Phototherapy is not the same as using a tanning bed. You should not use a tanning bed when you have psoriasis. It may trigger symptoms.
 Prescription medications are available for severe cases of psoriasis or for those who don’t respond to other treatments, like topical creams or phototherapy. These medications can be take orally or intravenously.The two types of drugs prescribed for severe cases are biologic or systemic drugs. Systemic drugs affect the whole immune system while biologics only target certain parts of the immune system.Your doctor will not prescribe these drugs unless no other treatment has worked.

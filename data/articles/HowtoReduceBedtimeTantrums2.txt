 When your child throws a bedtime tantrum, you might help the situation by recognizing what the tantrum is about. Generally, a bedtime tantrum occurs because the child doesn’t want to go to bed. When the tantrum begins, you could be able to end it quickly by saying, “Yes, I know that you want to stay up later but it’s important to get enough sleep so you can have a great day tomorrow.”, Part of why kids throw bedtime tantrums is because they want you to pay attention to them. Once your child’s fussing has evolved into a full-on tantrum, you should shut it down by ignoring it. By denying the child attention, you remove their motivation to continue their bedtime tantrum, or throw future bedtime tantrums. Unless your child is demonstrating dangerous behavior, you should let them cry themselves out alone.Simply leave your child in its bedroom, switch the lights off and say “Goodnight.”
If your child is demonstrating dangerous behavior – harming themselves or others, or damaging property – you should stay in the room with them and remind them that they cannot engage in violent behavior. For instance, you might say, “You cannot throw things in the house. That is not nice.”, If you find that ignoring the tantrum isn’t working, the next-best thing is to try giving your child a time-out. Time-outs are temporary periods of isolation for the child who is throwing a tantrum. Time-out communicates that you do not approve of your child’s bedtime tantrum and that they will suffer consequences for throwing future tantrums. You can give your child a time-out for between two and five minutes in a room of your choice.Ensure the room is not a location where the child can engage in fun activities like playing with games or toys, or watching television.
Time-out is ineffective for kids younger than three years old.

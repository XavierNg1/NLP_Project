 Before anything is signed, have your forms reviewed by a courthouse facilitator. Most courts in Washington have a courthouse facilitator program, which helps people with family law cases. The facilitator's office is usually located within the courthouse.Facilitators do not represent you or give legal advice, but they can usually review your forms and help you with any questions you have about the process.
 Make copies of your forms and take them to the court clerk. The clerk will stamp the original and the copies as "filed" and keep the original. Filing your forms initiates a court case. The clerk will contact you later to give you a hearing date.
 When you return to court for the hearing, the judge will ask you questions about your petition before he or she grants your request. The child's parents or guardians will have the opportunity to deny any allegations of abuse or neglect. Bring any evidence and witnesses you can use to demonstrate that it would be in the child's best interests to be removed from the parents or guardians and placed in your care.

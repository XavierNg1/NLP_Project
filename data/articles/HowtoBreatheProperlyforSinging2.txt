 You will place your hands near waist level. This will allow you to feel how your body moves as you inhale and exhale.
 As you inhale through your mouth, visualize the air moving into your diaphragm, the muscles below your lungs that help you to inhale and exhale. Your hands should move outward as you fill your lower lungs with air., Use your stomach muscles and diaphragm to force the air rapidly and with force. Exhale through your mouth. You will feel your hands moving inward as your diaphragm contracts., As you do this, visualize yourself breathing horizontally, rather than vertically. Your abdomen will expand and contract horizontally as you do so. Start out slowly and then pick up the tempo as you continue. If you find yourself slipping into breathing with your chest, stop and start over, breathing slowly again.Repeat this exercise once or twice daily.

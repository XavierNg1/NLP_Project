 For a tutu that you sew, you can use a bolt of fabric cut into strips or rolls of tulle ribbon. Any color can be used for your tutu, and the amount that you need will vary based on the width of your waist. You will also need to get a thin elastic measuring 1 inch (2.5 cm) or smaller.
 Wrap a soft measuring tape around your waist or wherever you would like the completed tutu to sit. Make sure that the measurement is not too loose; loose elastic will fit strangely and look awkward on.
 If you are using tulle yardage, lay it out flat and cut strips of the fabric measuring between 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) wide. The wider the strips, the more full your finished tutu will be. If you are using a bolt of tulle ribbon, cut it into long pieces of equal length between 50–80 inches (127.0–203.2 cm) long. The Strips will be folded in half, so ½ the length will be how long the tulle is on your body from the waistband. Cut your elastic to meet the measurement from your waist.
 Fold each strip of tulle in half over the elastic band. Use a straight stitch on your sewing machine to sew the two tail ends together directly underneath (but not on) the elastic band.
 Add all your strips of tulle around the length of the elastic waistband, bunching them together slightly as you work. You may need to cut and add more strips of tulle if you begin getting low near the ends of the elastic.
 When you reach the ends of the elastic band, sew them together using a zigzag stitch on your sewing machine. Adjust your tulle so that it gathers around the waistband evenly, and you’re finished! Enjoy your pretty new tutu and show off your sewing skills.,

 Maybe you know some other people who share the same interests as the person, or maybe you know some people who have a higher tolerance for annoying people than you do. Try to introduce him to people around your school or workplace that will distract him. Avoid introducing him to mutual friends, because that might make you more obligated to spend time with him.
 If you are not particularly close to the person, it is acceptable to just end communication. Unfriend him on social networks, ignore or block his phone calls and emails, and try to avoid situations where you might encounter him. Most relationships have a trial stage, during which it should be expected that you might break it off if things go sour.


This is not a valid strategy if you have been friends for years or if you live or work in close enough proximity that you can be expected to encounter one another again, When ending a relationship with a close friend, you should do so directly and in person. To soften the blow, start off by telling him what you liked about him and your relationship with him. Be honest about why you no longer want to be friends, but do so in a way that is neutral and not offensive.


Instead of accusing him of doing something wrong, tell him in an impersonal way what you need in a friend: “My life is stressful right now, and I need to be surrounded by people are relaxing and empathetic.”

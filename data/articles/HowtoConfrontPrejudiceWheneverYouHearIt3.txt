 Before charging into a situation to challenge someone’s prejudicial comments, it’s important to make sure you aren’t going to make the situation worse by reacting out of anger. Instead, take a moment to calm down by taking a deep breath.


A deep breath can relax your body and keep you from using any adrenaline released into your system for aggression., Distancing yourself mentally from the situation at hand can calm your emotions and make your passionate response less aggressive.Focus on why the other person acted with prejudice rather than how angry it's making you feel.


If the comment was directed toward something you identify with, pretend you are someone else and try to see it from their perspective.
If you feel adrenaline rushing and you are ready to fight, take a moment and pretend you're in a different location where there is no prejudice before responding.
 Before you speak out against prejudice, think about the tone of voice you are about to use and the body language you are expressing. Are you being aggressive? Will your reaction cause others to get aggressive? If so, change tactics before speaking.


Think before you speak as well. Try to use non-confrontational, non-accusatory vocabulary. Basically you want to avoid pointing your finger and causing others to feel anger toward you.
 If you are feeling too passionate and angry to employ a calm reaction to prejudice, walking away might be a good choice. This way you show that you are upset and that you aren’t allowing prejudice to continue without risking an aggressive confrontation.

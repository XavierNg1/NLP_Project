 Swelling in the skin on and around your eyes can make them look smaller. Try these steps to reduce puffiness:


Get plenty of sleep.
Wash your face with cool water.
Place cold, used teabags over your eyes. The tannins in the tea act as an astringent, tightening the skin.
Reduce your salt intake. Too much salt leads to water retention, which leads to eye puffiness.
Exercise to increase circulation, which in turn reduces water retention.
 This won't necessarily make your eyes look bigger, but dark circles will detract from even the biggest, most beautiful eyes.


Stay healthy. This means getting plenty of sleep, eating a balanced, healthy diet and minimizing the intake of salt in your diet.
Some people have thinner skin under their eyes, which can cause the appearance of dark circles. Use an orange or red primer under your concealer to balance blue or purple tones.
 Before you go to bed, place two spoons in the freezer overnight. Wake up, rub the sleep out of your eyes, and place the two spoons over each of your eyes for about 1 minute. This can help you appear refreshed and tighten up the skin around your eyes. Plus, it helps to reduce the appearance of under-eye circles.

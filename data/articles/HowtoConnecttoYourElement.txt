 This will draw the positive energy around you, so that there is no chance that any unwanted spirits will interrupt you. Make sure that you have brought something resembling your element into the centre.;
, The objects to represent each one should be:

Water - A cup of water. Works best on full moon.

Fire - A lit candle.

Earth - A flowerpot of earth.

Air - A feather, some incense or a fan.
 Think of how it feels to be consumed by it (e.g. water, underwater, fire, on a hot summer's day, earth, buried underground, and air, in the centre of a hurricane). Imagine it taking care of you, making sure you can breathe underwater, that you don't get too hot, crushed by the earth, or that you don't get whipped away by the wind.
 You could ask it to play with you. Your vision of being consumed by that element may become more vivid. Talk to it, tell it about what makes you happy or sad. Connect with it as you would connect with other people.

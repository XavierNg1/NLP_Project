 Most standard reds can be used to make a pink. Each red will produce a different shade of pink, so you can experiment until you find one that you especially like. Common reds have general characteristics, so select one accordingly.Cadmium reds ( light, medium, and deep) will produce a slightly orangey pink.
Pinks made from Scarlet Lake will be very bright.
Alizarin Crimson produces brilliant pinks that tend to have hints of blue and purple.
Rose Madder is a transparent hue that can be used to make thinner pinks.
Napthal Red will also produce transparent pinks that are very bright.
Quinacridone is a good hue for mixing with blues or gray to make tones of pink. When mixed with white alone, it will produce a very bright pink.
Earth reds (including Indian Red and Venetian Red) can also be used to make pinks that will seem natural.;
, To make pinks from acrylics, oils, and other generally opaque paints, you will mix your selected red with a white. However, not all whites are the same. For the best results when mixing colors to make pink, choose an opaque white (such as Titanium White). Transparent whites (like Zinc White) may only lighten the red without creating a true pink., Place some white and red paint on your palette. Start by adding just a bit of red to the white, and mix well. Keep adding a bit of red at a time until you reach the pink you want to use for your work.








Donâ€™t try to create pink by adding white to red, since this will take more time and use up lots of paint.
 Shades of colors are technically created by adding black to a hue. However, many painters find that using a complementary color instead of black creates better-looking colors. You can try adding a direct complementary (a green), but using a neighboring color like blue can also create nice results.








Whichever color you choose to tone down your pink, start by adding just a little at a time to the pink, and mixing well until you get the hue you like.

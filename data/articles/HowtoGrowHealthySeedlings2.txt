 If there are any special quirks and requirements that the plant in question has, be sure to meet these needs.



Fill the seed container to the top. Make it level (a float can be used to achieve this).
Sow large seeds directly onto the surface.
Sieve a fine layer of potting mix over the even surface and then add small seeds.
Sow evenly to give the growing seedlings space.
Except for seeds that need to remain at the surface (those needing light to germinate), cover the seeds with an even layer of the seed raising mix. A rule of green thumb is to cover to twice the length of the seed.

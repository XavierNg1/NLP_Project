 While the opportunities are endless, don't leave the decision till the last minute. Are you thinking of dyeing it? If so, do this well in advance, ditto for a new cut. Some classic hairstyles are updos (they make the outfit look very classy and sophisticated) or long loose curls (they make you look fun and cute). A side bun makes for a quirky change.

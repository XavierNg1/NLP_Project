 -- by having an urgent need, a strong desire, being empowered by loving what you do, doing what you love: "not 'desperate for attention' ". Desperate to be better.;
, Commit. Relax at times, but love what you do. Be desperate enough to have loads of energy -- by not just giving your all, but more importantly -- by being prepared and always improving, joyfully. Relaxed. Ask yourself:


What will energize me, and inspire me to keep loving it, and going? Decide: "Yes! I can make my own chance..." Make your own luck!
How can I get going in my desired field, make a great success -- if I "loll away" time. La La, Twiddle-dee-dumb? You can't.
 Be on point -- ahead of the the unmotivated middle.
 Don't be rounding out the also-ran, stragglers, doing-nothing. Get smarter, better, get a sale/or a customer, be the first one off the bench, if you can't be a first-teamer/starter.


Help someone today.
Talk to more people to get info.
Be more curious, being enthusiastic.
 Seize the moment and never let go of your "I get-it!" attitude.
 Work smarter (not just harder) than ever.


Try more good ideas, by persistence. Trying again and again.
Get more and better things done.
,


Force? Never force others to do what you need (or want them to do). Don't twist arms, and torment... that's terrorism.
 Have a sense of desperation. In life, in business, or active competitive sport.


Keep up your intense training regimen, which is unlike anything anybody else is doing.
Devise all kinds of scenarios and practice making every effort imaginable.



Time? Avoid age or time traps: bosses often promote persons with more seniority (one who has been there) and longevity (which is not necessarily worthwhile "experience"). Get noticed. Be an "overcomer"... overcome the odds... someone will.

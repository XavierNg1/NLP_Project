 One card is dealt in the first round, two in the second, three in the third, etc.;
, The suit of the card he draws becomes trump (see below) for that round.
 A player may bid any number between zero and the number of cards dealt that round. The dealer records the bids on a score sheet. When it comes his turn to bid, he may not bid so that the sum of the bids of all the players is exactly equal to the number of cards dealt. If the sum of the bids is exactly equal to the number of cards, there is a chance that there will be no loser.
 All subsequent players must follow suit (see below). The player who wins the trick leads the next hand, if there is one.
 If a player takes the exact number of tricks he bid, he receives 10 points, plus the number he bid. For example, if Jane bid 0 and took 0 and Ricardo bid 5 and took 5, Jane's score would be 10 and Ricardo's would be 15. If a player takes any other number of tricks, he receives no points. For example, of Hilda bid 3 but took 2, and Naomi bid 1 but took 3, both would receive a score of 0.
 One more card is dealt.

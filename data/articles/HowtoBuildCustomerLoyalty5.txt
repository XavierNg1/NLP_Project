 No matter how much your customers may like you, you won't be able to establish loyalty if you provide them with an inferior product or service. Use high-quality ingredients or parts and production that is not rushed or shoddy. Don't let your employees take short-cuts that would result in short-changing your customers.
 While many consumers report that they're willing to pay more for superior customer service, quite a lot of them expect stellar service regardless of price. Lots of consumers are strapped for cash, and can't afford to pay more even if you're willing to go above and beyond. This means there's a limit to how high you can set prices even if you excel at customer service.
 Try to balance your profit margin with the limits of your customer's budgets. Keep current with price fluctuations across your industry, and pay attention to your main competitors.


For example, if you run a local flower shop, investigate prices at other brick-and-mortar stores in your town. See whether any online florists deliver in your area and if you can compete with their prices.
 If your employees are dejected or demoralized, customers will notice and may be less inclined to give you repeat business.


If your employees respect you and enjoy working for you, they will be more dedicated to providing good customer service. Promote a "trickle down" effect, where happy employees make happy customers.

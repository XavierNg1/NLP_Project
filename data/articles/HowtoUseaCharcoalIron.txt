 First, you need to get all of the following materials together:

A piece of clothing to iron, such as jeans or a t-shirt



 


A charcoal iron and stand






A pack of charcoal






A box of matches






A bottle of kerosene






A spray bottle






An ironing table






A manual blower such as a silver plate, fan, or BBQ blower






A small stick






Two pieces of wrapper or old bed sheets






An outdoor location/ apartment balcony
A bottle of water/ bucket of water





;
, Preferably, in the backyard of your house, or balcony of your apartment.
 Use an old bed sheet if you don’t have one. This is to protect your clothing from soot, and/or smoke.
 Make sure to add enough charcoal to reach the brim.
 You should do this because small pieces of charcoal may fall out during ironing and will dirty your fabric. You can also use your stick to mix the charcoal so that small pieces can fall out. Using your mouth, blow out excess particles.
 Only pour droplets of kerosene, or else all of your clothes will smell like it. You can also use the spray bottle instead.
 A small fire should catch right where the kerosene was poured. Allow it to burn for a little bit.
, You can also fan the flame using the silver plate when you are tired. Use your small stick to mix the charcoal around to make sure all the pieces are getting hot. You can also close the lid, secure the small rooster, and then swing it from side to side, allowing the breeze to help blow it.
 When you open it up again you should see glowing embers of charcoal. At that point, you can close it up, wipe the bottom on the wrapper/ sheet on the ironing table.
 Wash your hands properly, and then start ironing. Run the iron back and forth along your clothes until they are crisp and wrinkle-free.

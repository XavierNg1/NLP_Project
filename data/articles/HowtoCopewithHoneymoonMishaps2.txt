 You and your partner can cope with a honeymoon mishap by planning a fun alternative to your old plans. If you cannot go on the beach due to bad weather, for example, you may order room service and play board games or watch movies and drink wine in your room. Come up with fun alternative plans with your partner so you can still enjoy yourselves.You and your partner may sit down and make a list of alternative activities you can do together for fun on your honeymoon. Get creative and brainstorm fun ideas so you can still spend quality time together.
 If you are staying at a hotel or a resort, you may ask a representative at the front desk for advice on what you can do as a guest if you are limited to staying in the hotel. Or if you are staying at a B&B, you may call down to reception and ask them if there are any indoor activities you and your partner can do. Reach out to others and see if there are other activities you can still do on your honeymoon despite a mishap.For example, you may discover there is an indoor bar with a lounge singer in the hotel that you can go to with your partner rather than venture outside in bad weather. Or maybe there is a games room in the resort that you and your partner can spend time in while you wait for a storm to blow over.
 Whatever you and your partner decide to do as you try to stay positive, you should both strive to have a time together that is meaningful and special. Be present and aware of your partnerâ€™s needs, especially if the mishap is stressing them out. Suggest fun things you can do as a couple instead and try to find activities that are specific to you as a couple.


For example, if you and your partner love Mexican food but are unable to go out to a Mexican restaurant in the area where you had reservations due to a mishap, you may get the restaurant to deliver your meal or have the hotel chef make the meal in the hotel for you both.

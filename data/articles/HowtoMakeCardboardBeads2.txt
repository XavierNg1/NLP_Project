 Open up the box along all of its seams and lay it out flat. Then take a pair of scissors and cut off the bottom and top tabs. You should be left with a rectangular piece of unbent cardboard.You can leave creased pieces of cardboard on the box if you are okay with some slight bumps in your beads.
 On the inside of the box (the side with nothing printed on it), use a ruler and mark your strips. Draw strips that are Â¾ of an inch (2 cm) on one end and 1/8 (3.18 mm) of an inch on the other. Once you have drawn all of your strips, cut them out with a pair of scissors., Take the wide end of a cardboard strip and wrap it around a piece of 14 gauge wire. Then slowly coil the cardboard around the wire. Make sure that the cardboard wraps around itself evenly in the middle. Once you reach the end, apply a small dollop of white glue and hold it until it adheres.Repeat this step for each individual bead.
 Once you have wrapped all of your beads, apply a coat or two of Mod Podge. This will help the beads stay together. Once they are dry, the beads are ready to be threaded., You can now use your beads made from cereal boxes on your project.

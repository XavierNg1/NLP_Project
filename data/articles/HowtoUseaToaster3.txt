 Most toasters require access to an electric wall outlet. If the toaster is plugged in, but isn't working, then there may be a deeper electrical failure.
 Do not, under any circumstances, put a metal implement into the toaster while it is plugged in. Likewise, do not reach your hand into the toasting slots while the appliance is hot. The toaster works by firing metal filaments up to high heat using dangerous electrical currents. If you use your hand, you may burn yourself. If you put a fork into the slots, then you run the risk of electrocuting yourself.If the toast gets stuck in the slots: try depressing the lever for a moment, then popping it up manually—quickly, with force—to fling the toast out the top of the toaster.
Unplug the toaster before you try to remove food that is stuck. Then, use wooden tongs to remove the item. Wooden tongs will not conduct electricity!

, Try turning it upside-down to shake out the crumbs that have fallen deep into the slots. Most toasters feature a flat, removable tray that slides in and out of the bottom of the appliance. This tray catches crumbs and burnt bits. Remove the tray and dump out the contents to clear space for more crumbs.

 If it is your first time drawing her, you may want to stick to drawing her by looking at a picture. Find a picture of Tohru that you can reference while drawing.;
, A good way to do this is to draw lines that show how the character is standing. Make sure these lines are drawn lightly so you can erase them later on.
 The outline should be very simple. You should not worry about details until later. You should also draw this lightly in case you wish to change it later on.
 Adjustments to the drawing can also be made at this point.
 This includes the nose, mouth, eyes, and eyebrows. Also put faint lines of where the hair will be. Take into account that the particular anime style Tohru is drawn in has large eyes and a small nose and mouth. The nose and mouth are extremely simple with little detail while the eyes have a lot of detail and are more difficult to draw.
 Some may feel it is easier to use a straight edge like a ruler for certain parts of the clothes. Put a line around any area that has a shadow so you can fill it in later.
 If lines of pencil show up in the shading rub your finger on it and it will fade. This may smudge the pencil into areas you don't want it in if you are not careful. Erase any gray areas that should be white.
 Take note of what areas will be darker than other parts of the hair. Also draw in her hand and shade the underside of it.
 Her hair is dark brown so color it in heavily. At this point you should go back and make sure no areas got darker than you wanted from dragging your hand across the paper while drawing.
 It is okay if your drawing does not come out exactly like the picture you used. All you can do is practice until you get it right! Good luck!

 Once the sunflower gets to be about waist height, you might want to give the plant some support using a tall, sturdy garden stake or cane. Drive this into the ground fairly deeply and then loosely tie the sunflower stalk to the cane.


You may want to tie the plant in another place further up the stem as it grows.
 Remember to give your sunflower some water during dry periods. Make sure not to over-water your plant because sunflowers do not generally like having soggy feet.
 Slugs and snails may attack the young plants so you might consider covering them with a clear plastic bottle with the funnel end cut off to make a homemade cloche. Remember to remove this once the plant starts to outgrow it.


Alternately, consider using pellets or traps.
 Sunflowers are hungry plants. You can really help the plant’s growth by giving it a weekly feed with a liquid fertilizer. Avoid using slow release or granular fertilizers as these will release nutrients too slowly to benefit the fast-growing plant.


You may find that the sunflowers won’t grow as well the following year because the nutrients in that area have been depleted. Mix in plenty of manure at the end of the growing season to help stimulate regrowth.

 Pinning your tweets will require you to be on a computer or a laptop. You must first open your Internet browser. Once your browser is open, click on the search bar and type in www.twitter.com. You will be directed to the main page of Twitter.;
, Now that you are on the main page, look up towards the top-right side of the screen. You will see the “Sign in” button in the white bar. Click on this to open up the sign in page.


Click on the first box and type in your username, then click on the box below it and enter your password.
Once you have entered your information, click the blue “Sign in” button to access your account.
 Once your home page loads, you will need to go to your profile page. In order to get there, you have to click on the button with a silhouette of the top of a person at the top of the screen that says “Me.”


On your profile page, you will be viewing it the way other people see it.
 Scroll down through your posts until you see the one that you want to pin to the top of your Twitter page. Once you find that post, click on it to open it in a new page.
 Your post will be large on your screen. Directly below the post are a couple of options. Beside the one that reads “Favorite” is one that says “More,” with three dots beside it. Click on the “More” button to access the drop-down menu, then click on the second option, which says “Pin to your profile page.”

, You will get confirmation that your tweet was pinned. Click on the “Me” button again at the top of the screen. This will bring you back to your main profile page. Directly above your tweet will be the words “Pinned Tweet,” if you went through the process correctly.


You have successfully pinned a tweet to your Twitter profile page.

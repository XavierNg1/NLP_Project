 All a percentage is a simple way to display a fraction whose bottom number (known as the denominator) is 100. A percentage tells you how many things you would have if you had 100 total. For example, say 25% of your apple harvest is always spoiled. That means for every 100 apples you harvest, 25 of them will be spoiled, or 25/100. Converting fractions allows you to find percentages in the real world, such as what percentage of apples is spoiled if you get 450 bad apples out of 2,500.


If your fraction already has a denominator of 100, like 25/100, the top number is the percentage.1% means that there is "1 per every 100.", Sometimes you are not given the fraction, and you need to make it yourself. The hardest part here is figuring out which number goes on top, and which on bottom. The bottom number is always your "whole amount." It is your total apple harvest, the amount on the restaurant bill, the number of slices of pie, etc. This is the number you're getting a percentage of. The following examples show how to set up fractions:


Jaime has 4,000 songs. If 500 of them are by the Grateful Dead, what percentage of his music is by the San Francisco jam legends?

You want the percentage of Dead songs out of 4,000 total songs. The fraction would be 500/4,000.


Sally puts $1,000 into a stock. 3 months later, she returns and sees that it has grown to $1,342. What was her percentage of growth?

Because you are trying to find the percentage of 1,000 that grew bigger, your fractions is 1,342/1,000.
 If you can "make" the bottom number 100, you can simply take the top number as your percentage, and the conversion is done. Remember, however, that anything you do to the bottom of a fraction needs to be done to the top as well. For example:



Problem: Convert 3/25 to a percentage.
25 is easily turned into 100, since 4x25 = 100.
Multiply both the top and bottom by 4 to rearrange the fraction into 12/100

4 x 3 = 12.
4 x 25 = 100.


The top number is your percentage. Here 3/25 = 12/100 = 12%


, If the bottom number is not easily converted to 100, like in the fraction 16/64, then divide the top number by the bottom. Here, 16 divided by 64 =.25


This number is commonly a decimal, but it can be a larger number if the top of the fraction is bigger than the bottom.
 In the previous example 16/64 = .25. To finish converting 16/64 into a fraction, multiply .25 by 100 by moving the decimal over two places to the right. Therefore, 16/64 = 25%.


This is how you know the percentage when the denominator is 100, since 12/100 multiplied by 100 equals 12.
A decimal point represents, in essence, the percentage of "one." For each .1 you add you get closer to making "a single 1" (.9 + .1 = 1.0) This is why moving the decimal works to turn decimals into percentages, because your find how many smaller parts make up the whole "one" that you are studying, such as "one" harvest of 2,566 apples.
 The recommended daily caloric intake is 2000 calories. You eat this much today, but then go out for cake and ice cream later and add an extra 1500 calories to your day. What percentage of the recommended daily calories did you eat today?


Find your total calories.

Here, it is 2000 + 1500, or 3500 calories.


Create a fraction.

Think of the "whole." 1 full days worth of calories is 2000. Therefore, you're looking for the percentage of 2000 calories you ate. Your fraction would be 3500/2000.


Divide your total calories (3500) by the recommended amount of calories (2000).

3500 รท 2000 = 1.75


Multiply this number by 100 to get the percentage.

1.75 x 100 = 175



You ate 175% of the recommended daily calories.

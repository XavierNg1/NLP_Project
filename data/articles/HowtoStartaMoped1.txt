, Since mopeds generate automatic movement, they have a kill switch to shut them down quickly. The kill switch is a colored switch near the handlebars. Find it and flip it to the on position, which is often represented as an open circle., The brake levers are on the moped’s handlebars. The back brake is necessary to engage and is activated by the left lever. However, it’s easier to hold both until you are ready to drive.The moped will move automatically when you start it, so if you don’t have the back brake engaged, you’ll pitch forward.
 Continue holding the levers. Use your thumb to hit the start button. This will often be a red button near the right handlebar. Once you hear the motor start, you are free to release the brakes and drive.

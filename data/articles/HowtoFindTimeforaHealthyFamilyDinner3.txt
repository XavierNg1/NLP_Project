 Preparing dinner together not only saves you time but it teaches children important responsibilities. Choose tasks that are developmentally appropriate for your child. Include your partner to also help out to foster a family atmosphere.Young children (under the age of six) may be able to help set the table, wash dishes, and help stir ingredients.
Older children (ages six to twelve) may be able to wash vegetables, stir pots (if supervised), pour water, set out serving dishes, and clear the table.
Teenagers should be able to help you with most aspects of cooking and cleaning.
 If both you and your partner or spouse have busy schedules, you may want to try taking turns making family dinners. Look over both of your schedules, and agree on times when you can each make the meal., Dinner is traditionally the meal in which the entire family gathers to eat. That said, if dinner does not work for your family, you might consider having a family breakfast instead.If you’re worried about waking up early to cook breakfast, you can always prepare something the night before.
 Family dinners are a great time to bond, and if your family enjoys the meals, they’re much more likely to stick to the meal schedule. Try to come up with interesting topics for discussion. If the children don’t answer right away, you can start discussion by giving your own answer. You might try asking: If you could go anywhere in the world, where would it be?
Are you meeting any interesting people at school?
Have you had any interesting dreams lately?
If you had a superpower, what would it be?
If you could meet anyone from history, who would it be?
If you could have any animal in the world as a pet, which one would it be?

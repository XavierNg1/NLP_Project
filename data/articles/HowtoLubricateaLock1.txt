, Use a spray cleaner, such as WD-40, to clean the lock cylinder and opening. Spray the cleaner into the keyhole.

 If you are in a pinch and just need to get your lock moving quickly, you could try WD-40. Spray WD-40 into the keyhole. Insert your key into the keyhole and open and close the lock in order to work the WD-40 into the deadbolt.








Keep in mind that WD-40 will attract dust particles and eventually gum up your lock. It should only be used as a short-term solution.

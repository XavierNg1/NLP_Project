 Your cat may benefit from a cat food that’s specifically made for hairballs. This food contains ingredients that are supposed to help the hairballs move through the cat’s body so it won’t gag or vomit them up.You can ask your vet for a formula recommendation or find one online or at a pet store.
 If your cat is gagging due to too much hair, start brushing it more often. Try brushing its fur daily to remove loose hair. This may reduce the amount of hair your cat ingests when it grooms.You may also want to wipe your cat’s coat with a damp cloth to remove any loose hair the brush didn’t get.
 You can talk to your vet about getting a laxative or other digestive aid that will help the hair and hairballs pass more easily through the digestive tract. These products contain some type of lubricant that helps hair avoid getting stuck., Hairballs can lead to gagging. Hairballs occur when your cat can’t digest the hair it has swallowed while grooming. To help reduce gagging and get the hair to go through your cat, try mixing one to two tablespoons of canned pumpkin into your cat’s food. This food has a lot of fiber, which can help your cat push the hair through.Olive oil is another food product you can try. Add one teaspoon of olive oil to the food. This can aid in digestion, which can reduce gagging.
You can add these foods once or twice a week to your cat’s food.

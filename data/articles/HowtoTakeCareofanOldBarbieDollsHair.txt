 If the doll is really dirty soak it for approximately ten minutes. If it has just a little dirt, soaking it for just four minutes is enough. The main purpose of soaking its hair in water is to let the dirt wash off.;
,, With the shampoo still in the doll's hair, comb it from top to bottom, like how you would comb your hair. For this step, do not use your comb, or any comb which your family uses. Use a separate comb because the comb will get really messy.
, Keep rubbing the head as if you're giving it a head massage.
 If you are leaving it free, using the conditioner like clay, mould the hair in a free-hair style. If you are putting it in a ponytail mould it in a ponytail hair style.
 Add some more shampoo and rinse it out again.
, Your doll is all clean!

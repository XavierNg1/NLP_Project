 Spread out onto a plate and put the cubes in the freezer until they become very hard but not quite frozen.
 Leave until the yeast turns foamy.


Add the butter cubes, and if using a food processor, pulse until the flour mixture becomes grainy.






If mixing by hand, mix together with your hands by grabbing and rubbing until it becomes rather grainy. (You can also use a pastry blender for this, but hands work best.)







,


Add in batches to the flour mixture while the food processor is running (or if by hand, mix vigorously with a wooden spoon.)






When you're done you'll have a rather shaggy looking ball of dough.
, Knead it rapidly, pushing and turning, adding sprinkles of flour if needed, until you have a fairly smooth ball.
 Cover with plastic wrap or a plate, and leave to rise for about an hour.
 Suck as much air out of the bag as you can, seal tightly and then put the whole thing into another plastic bag, and place in the refrigerator.


Leave it there for at least 4-5 hours, preferably overnight or more. Making the dough up to this point the day ahead of when you want to bake it makes the most sense. You can leave it refrigerated for a maximum of 3 days. During this time, you will find that the dough will rise and almost burst the bag open, so you will need to periodically take a look at it and punch it down. This is why double-bagging is a good idea, since you may accidentally puncture the bag while punching it too hard.
 Roll out the dough into a long flat sausage and filled it with the chocolate and nuts.
,, Make several slits around the dough with a pair of kitchen scissors, to form a sort of flower shape. Leave in a warm place until about doubled in bulk. Twenty minutes before you intend to start baking, switch on the oven to 180°C / 350°F.
, Start checking at around 40 minutes; it should look dark golden brown and a bit crispy.

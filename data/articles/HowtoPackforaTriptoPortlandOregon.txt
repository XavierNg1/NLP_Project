 The season of your visit should definitely determine what you bring. Winters are cold but usually mild (30-55 degrees F), and frost is typical most mornings with the occasional disruptive snowfall. Rain is typical every season, though markedly less in July and August when the weather frequently hovers at 75 and above, up to 100 on the very hottest days. Autumn is brisk but generally pleasant, and layering is key. Make sure you pack in preparation for the seasonal weather:


In the cool months (October-February), bring a raincoat/windbreaker, jeans, scarf and hat (and even some coffee/hot chocolate!).
In the warm months (June, July-August), bring airy clothing, light sweater, sandals, sunglasses, sunscreen, iced tea/cold beer, raincoat.
In the spring (March-May), bring a raincoat and light layers.;
, Portland style is stereotypically outdoorsy and casual, with a strong strain of hipster chic and organic cotton, but very often clothes from any part of REI (outdoor store) are sufficient city wear. Much of the city dresses like everywhere else, but most people will embrace any style, though formality gets you noticed.
 Pack for your activitiesâ€”whether for the coast (often a little chilly but beautiful), a hike or walk in the huge Forest Park or surrounds, snow adventures on Mt Hood, a swimsuit for various swimming holes either along the Willamette and Columbia rivers or further afield with local guidance, or a summer dress for strolling the waterfront park.

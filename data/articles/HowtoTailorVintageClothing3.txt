 One of the best ways to find vintage clothing to alter yourself is by browsing through multiple thrift shops. Spend some time going through the racks to see what you can find. Try going to several thrift stores.Remember that thrift stores are constantly receiving new items, so it’s often worthwhile to check back frequently.
 Lots of people purge their closets by having garage or yard sales. They often just want to get rid of stuff and not deal with the hassle of reselling items, even if they might be quite valuable. Look in your local paper for yard sale listings and go around searching for cool vintage finds.The early bird usually gets the worm when it comes to garage sales, so try to go earlier in the morning if you want to score the best items.
 Many people sell their used clothing online – including pictures and negotiable prices. You can usually contact the owner with any additional questions you might have. This is a great way to save time and money when shopping for vintage clothing.


Try looking on websites like eBay where individuals sell their own used clothing, rather than shopping through marked-up items from retro retail stores.

 You will not feed all of them to your dog, so they can be foods you like too. Make a show of enjoying this food, so that you've really gotten your dog's attention.The key is to make your dog desire what you're eating.
 This is not medicine, but a way to get your dog to expect good-old, no-medicine food. He will let his guard down. Your dog will take for granted that it wants to eat whatever falls.
 Other times, quickly grab the food from the dog. In this way you establish a sense that your dog must act quickly in order to snatch the food. This will encourage him to try to eat what you drop, without thinking.
 This can be hidden in food, or just by itself. Try to quickly grab it from the dog, in an attempt to trick him into eating it. If your dog already expects it might lose the opportunity, you may not even have to try that hard.
 This process works best when there are no other dogs around. There is a risk that another dog might try to take the pill this way, and so it is important to isolate the dog you want to medicate. However, keeping another dog in view, but behind a gate, in a crate, or outside, can increase the medicated dog's excitement.

 Hard boil three eggs. Let them cool, then peel them and chop them into cubes. Slice two avocados in half. Remove the pits with a spoon or knife. Slice the avocado into cubes, then turn them out of the skin., Place the cubed egg and avocado into a bowl. Add the sour cream, chili powder, red pepper, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Stir everything together with a fork until you get the texture you like. The more you stir, the smoother it will become.These sandwiches will be very spicy. You can always use fewer spices or omit them altogether., You can do this using a spoon or a melon scoop, but make sure that each slice gets the same amount. Save the other four slices for later., You can do this using a mini rubber spatula or a butter knife. Try to get the filling as close to the edges and corners as you can., Gently press down on each sandwich to seal it together., Slice the crusts off first, so that you get four, equal-sized rectangles. This give you a smoother finish on all four sides. Once you have the crusts off, slice the sandwiches widthwise into thirds., Because of how rich these sandwiches are, you do not need to garnish them. If you want to, however, you can arrange them on their sides on a plate, then sprinkle them with them crushed red pepper.

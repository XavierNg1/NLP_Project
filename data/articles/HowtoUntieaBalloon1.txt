 Look closely at the balloon knot and find where it rolls over itself.;
, You must be careful in this process. You want to be able to see the area where you'll be able to slide your fork into.
 Unless the knot is super tight, it should slide through real easy.


Careful not to pierce the balloon at this stage.
 This works even better than a fork prong. Thick needles with a blunt, rounded point are the best. Moisten the needle a little bit by licking it for easier access.
 Use either the needle or fork to roll the knot out. You can help by trying to push the knot while sliding it down., If it doesn't unroll the first time, slide it back up and repeat this process.

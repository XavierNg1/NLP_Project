Take the fixtures off of the furniture. If there is finish on the fixtures, soak them in a dish of paint remover while stripping the wood. If you are unable to remove the hardware, place painter's tape around it.
Remove any upholstery from the furniture.
 Lay cloth or newspaper over your work surface. Place the wood to be stripped on top of the cloth or newspaper. Ensure that the room is well-ventilated.
 Use a brush to apply paint remover to 1 small surface at a time. Do not thin out the remover by spreading it. Ensure that you leave a thick coating of remover on the surface.
 Lay aluminum foil over the coated surface. Allow the surface to rest for 25 to 30 minutes. Coat another area while waiting for the previous surface to finish resting.
 Take the foil off of the covered surface. There should be cracks and bubbles where the solvent has been applied.



Put on a pair of rubber gloves.
Press a finger into a bubbly section. The thinner and finish are ready to remove if you are able to place your finger easily on the original wood.
If you are unable to reach the original wood with your finger after 30 minutes, wait 10 more minutes. If you are still unable to reach the wood after 40 minutes, remove the thinner.
Repeat the thinner application process until you are able to reach the original wood with your finger.
 Use a scraper to shave the thinner and finish from the wood.

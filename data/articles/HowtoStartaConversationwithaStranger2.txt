 In public places, especially in larger cities, people are generally wary of strangers coming up to them with a big smile. "What are they selling?" is usually the first question on their minds. "What do they want? Are they muggers? Missionaries?" Some or all of these questions may run through their mind as you approach them, so think before you act.


If it's somebody who you have seen often—whether it's during break, on a subway platform, or on the street where you work—try to make eye contact without being too obvious about it (i.e., don't stare!). Make eye contact, smile in a friendly way, and then go do whatever it is you were doing in the first place. Unless you're playing with the tip of a knife as you make eye contact and smile, this will establish you in the "friendly" category.
 Because people are more wary in public places, if you come up behind them or they don't see you approach, you could startle them. By making your friendly intentions clear, you diffuse any possible tension that could arise.


Save your best pickup lines for the bar. Say something light, humorous, or topical to first break the ice. For example, "Hi, my name's Pat. I work over at Smithers and Burns, and noticed you are here often. Do you work in the neighborhood?" is simple, direct, and is open-ended enough to get a response, which can range anywhere from "Leave me alone," to "Hi, I'm Jan! I have seen you here too. Would you like to have a seat?"

, Chances are there are a lot of shared interests just waiting to be uncovered. Ask leading questions, and listen well to the responses.

 Some people ride many horses depending on the event, in some cases, riders are only permitted to ride two horses to go towards High Point Awards. In some shows you can ride as many horses as you wish. Try riding the one horse in every event, from Showmanship, Hack, Hunter Under Saddle, Hunt Seat Equitation through to Western Pleasure, Western Horsemanship and Trail. This not only shows the diversity and versatility of your horse, but you will be with the few that compete with only one horse in all the events...and these riders do just as well in terms of placings and results.;
, It is the same with horses, an English trained horse is able to do Western with the right training and guidance, but you should take all necessary actions to provide adequate training in this event before asking the horse to ride it. This is the same for any Western Performance event, from Halter, Hack, Hunter Under Saddle, Equitation and Western and Trail. From the point above, if you compete with your horse in everything, keep in mind its abilities. Does it side pass with ease? Are you able to lope straight from a halt? These aspects are required for Western Equitation. Can your horse Canter with a loose rein? Can you get a single or a two beat simple change from one lead to the next? These are important features of an English Performance Horses, especially for the Equitation. You can try all the events, but ride each horse to its abilities and not so much to its faults...you can improve them as your ride.

 As mentioned above, you should always wash your hands when taking an infant’s pulse in order to avoid passing any microorganisms on to the infant.
 You will not need a stethoscope to listen to the brachial pulse, as it is not as loud as the apical pulse so you will most likely not be able to hear it. Instead, you will use your pointer and middle finger to feel the pulse.You will also need:


A watch that counts seconds
A pen and paper

, Again, as mentioned above, it is important to take the infant’s pulse when she is lying on her back because when an infant is held in a vertical position, her heart rate tends to increase. .This is because her heart is working harder to pump blood down into the lower extremities and back out again.
 Make sure that the infant is not crying before taking the pulse as extreme emotions activate the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system, when activated, will increase the heart rate.Do your best to soothe the infant and make sure that she is calm before you take a measurement of her pulse, otherwise you may not get an accurate reading.
 You can do this by rubbing your hands together. If you have cold hands, placing them on the infant’s sensitive skin may cause her to become startled, in which case she may begin to cry.
 Put your point and middle finger on the infant’s inner bend of the upper arm at the back of the elbow. Press your fingers firmly but gently against the baby’s skin to try to feel the pulse.


Count the pulse rate of the infant for one full minute for accurate results. Get the pen and paper and record the number of times you feel the infant’s pulse beat in the span of 60 seconds.
Consider repeating this process for another 60 seconds to double-check your findings.

 Be more outgoing, happy, and smart.;
, Some black is still nice, but as for all of the Clash t-shirts, put them in storage for now. Wear bright colors. Always wear cute jewelry and make sure it matches your outfit!

, For instance, O.A.R., acoustic pop, Vampire Weekend, British indies, and whatever may be playing on your favorite classic rock. Look for virtuosic guitar, especially in folk music, soft vocals, and somewhat less political themes, but not Britney Spears. All classic rock IS fair game. So are art rock bands like the Flaming Lips, and 90's alternative like the Strokes. Classic bands are also solo artists like Bob Dylan, John Lennon, and Jakob Dylan, Bob Dylan's son.
 Don't make it look like you just stepped out of a beauty pageant, just a little lip gloss and blush is fine.
 Usually, they will not be catty unless you provoke them or have said mean stuff to/about them in the past. We're nice people.
 No matter how much makeup you choose to wear, it's ALWAYS good to practice good habits, such as washing your face and brushing your teeth regularly.
 People (and teachers) will be suspicious if you go from wearing hoodies and ripped up jeans to ripped jeans and a neat shirt the next day. Messy preppy clothes will draw attention away from the shift, and doing it over a month or more can soften it too.
 Many preps have fit and healthy bodies. Try involvement in "preppy sports" like tennis, golf, crew, and soccer. Real preps are also into healthy eating, and organic and Fair Trade produce. Shop at Whole Foods for some organic macaroni, and look for soy alternatives to dairy products.
 Preps are known for kindness toward everyone, even if you know some who have been mean to you.

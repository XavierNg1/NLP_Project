 This will depend mostly on how tall you are. The board should be long enough so that you can have a wide, shoulder-width stance while riding it. It should also be wide enough so that your feet won't hang off the sides. Around 33" by 14" is good.;
, Also purchase some large diameter, (5" to 7 is good), thick walled PVC or ABS pipe. It should be long enough to fit the width of your board, and strong enough that it does not flex easily, since you will be putting your weight on it.
,, Use these for safety if you think you will hurt yourself, otherwise you don't need them. These will help the board not slip off the end of the pipe while riding.
 Put on a safety helmet, wrist guards, elbow and knee pads. Again, you only need these if you think you might get hurt. Step on the board carefully, (using a chair or someone's shoulder for support, at least the first few times), and test your balance!

 A cheap iron is more likely to have problems, clog, or burn your clothes.;
, Tap water can clog the steam function on your iron over time. Use distilled water or bottled water, if you can.
 Be sure the floor underneath is clean.


If you don't have an ironing board put clean bath towels on a table top.
 If you are ironing more than one dress shirt or more than one item, have hangers and a place to hang the shirt while the other items are being ironed. A nearby chair or a door handle can do in a pinch.
 You will need the hand towel for ironing the sleeves. It is not absolutely required but it will make it much easier.

 First preheat the oven to 400°F (204.4°C), and line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil. You can use Corn Chex cereal, or any type of cereal that is similar. Put the cereal into a plastic bag or between between two sheets of waxed paper. Crush the cereal with a rolling pin., Pour the crush cereal, cheese, salt, seasoned salt, paprika, and garlic powder into a medium bowl. Stir together the ingredients. Leave out the bowl because you will soon coat the chicken in this mixture., Pour the butter and milk into a small bowl. Stir this mixture together. This bowl should not be combined with the cereal mixture., The chicken should be cut into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Dip the chicken into the butter and milk mixture. Then, evenly coat the chicken in the cereal mixture., Placed the coated chicken on the baking sheet. Bake the chicken nuggets for 9 minutes. Turn the nuggets over after 9 minutes and cook for 8 more minutes. Cook until the coating has turned golden brown, and the center of the chicken is no longer pink. Allow the nuggets to cool for a few minutes and then serve warm.

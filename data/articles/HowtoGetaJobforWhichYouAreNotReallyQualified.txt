 Being prepared is more important than job knowledge, skills and experience.;
, Think creatively about how the experience you have relates to the job you want. Bullet aspects of your previous jobs relevant to the position you seek.
 The hardest part of getting a job for which you may not be the most technically qualified applicant is getting an interview.
, Focus on why you honestly believe you would be good at this particular job. Make a list of reasons beforehand. If you have confidence in yourself, you are more likely to convince the employer of your ability.
 A positive attitude will show the interviewer you are a can-do person.
 We all want to hire and work with people we like.
 Know about the company and the business before you go to the interview. Know what they expect you to do for the company.
 There is always more to the job than what can be said in an ad. As you find out more about the job, you may discover job functions for which you are more qualified and you can direct your focus on them.
 If the employer is willing to train you for the job, demonstrate enthusiasm about learning new things and a willingness to put extra time and effort into training. If you are a quick study, now is the time to mention it.
 If the job is not something you are qualified to do, ask to leave your resume with the company or ask if there are similar opportunities at a lower level. If you appear enthusiastic, intelligent and committed, your interviewer(s) is more likely to offer suggestions to help you break into the field.
 When there are two or more candidates competing for the same position, more often than not the hiring will be based on chemistry and less on experience. Ensure that you smile often throughout the interview and laugh where ever appropriate. A positive attitude demonstrated with smiles goes a long way to sending the signal that you have what it takes to become a team player.

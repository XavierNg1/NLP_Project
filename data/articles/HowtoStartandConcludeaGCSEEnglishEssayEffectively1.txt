 There will be "trigger" words embedded in the question that should be able to point you in the right direction. They may more apparent such as describe, explain, analyse to name a few. You should also know what each of these trigger words mean. However, it will be a lot more common for questions such as "The Barn and another creates a powerful sense of place and feeling" to appear. I know that the question is asking me to compare this poem to another poem that is similar in terms of tone and style. In doing this, I will make comments on and analyse the language of one and compare it to the other. You will need to practice this so that you'll be able to do it quickly.

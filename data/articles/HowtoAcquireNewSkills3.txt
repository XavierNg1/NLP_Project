 Not only are you able to learn from others but you’ll be encouraged to make progress together. Whether it is a chess club, a mastermind group, or an online meet-up group, get connected with other like-minded individuals.
 Whatever skill you would like to learn, there is always a course that can teach you the skill. It can be a two-week summer course or an 11-month course. Just make sure you practice your skill, because you can always forget your new skill if you don't practice diligently.

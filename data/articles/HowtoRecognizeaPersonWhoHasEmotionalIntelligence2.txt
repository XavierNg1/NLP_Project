 Those with high emotional intelligence will often look you directly in your eye when speaking to you to convey that they are paying attention and are focused. Those with low EI will look down at their feet or at their phone while you are speaking and may not even be hearing what you’re saying., When a person is emotionally intelligent, they do not feel the need to fake emotions. Therefore, any expressions of happiness, sadness, or anger will be genuine. Notice whether or not the person you are assessing is showcasing a smile that is genuine.A genuine smile is indicated by the eyes, as well. When someone fakes a smile, their eyes seem disengaged from the process. A true smile requires the full face for effect.
 You can also assess a person’s gestures to determine if they are emotionally intelligent. A person with high EI will want to convey emotions that are appropriate for the setting and that will not increase anxiety in the person they are speaking with. Watch out for those who make wild and unexpected gestures or who take up too much physical space by spreading their arms or legs out unnecessarily.Fidgeting is also a sign of those with low EI.
If a person has a poker face, this means they are trying to hide their true emotions. While this may be useful in some settings, you can properly emote without having to be dramatic or stifle yourself.
Notice those who display controlled breathing. A person who is constantly huffing and puffing is likely not EI.
 One of the biggest signs of an emotionally intelligent person is body mirroring. Mirroring is defined as the act of mimicking certain gestures of the person you are speaking with to convey empathy. It is often done unconsciously, but it shows that the person you are speaking to is actively listening and feeling for you.If you have your head tilted slightly to the side, notice if they do, as well.

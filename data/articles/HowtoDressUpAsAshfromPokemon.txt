 Ash wears a jacket that is blue on top and white on the bottom. The jacket could be substituted for a solid blue or jean jacket. The jacket is best if it's blue with yellow buttons.;
, Should you feel the urge to take the jacket off, Ash wears a solid black shirt underneath.
,, Keep it simple.
 There are over three different versions of Ash's hat, but the most recent is red on the bill, sides and back of the hat, and white in the front. There is a blue Pokéball in the middle of the front of the hat. If you're a good artist, you could make this yourself, but if art is not your strong suit you can buy an Ash hat on eBay.


Find an advanced generation hat. You can also wear an Ash hat.
 These should be fingerless, so if they're not that way already, cut the fingers off the gloves.
 Alternatively, purchase one. Carry it around with you.


See Tips for making a Pokéball.
 Ash travels a lot, so carry a backpack in a solid color. Pink is to be avoided. Fill it with Pokéballs, a Pokédex, and anything else necessary.
 You might want to consider getting a Pikachu stuffed animal and carrying it on your shoulder like Ash does.

Alternatively, get someone to dress up as Pikachu and accompany you.
 Ash has short black hair in his trademarked spike style. This can be accomplished with washout hair dye if your hair isn't black, and lots of hair gel. Or, if you want to save yourself the trouble; you could buy a short black wig, people won't notice if it isn't perfect.


Spike your hair at the ends.
 Your version of Ash will be more entertaining if you have lots of stories about your adventures in the different Pokémon regions, people you met while traveling, especially challenging gym battles, etc.

 Having something to read can make time pass during a long car ride. You can pack your favorite books or magazines, or an e-reader if you have one. Try to bring more than one book – you might get bored with just one, and having more than one option can keep you entertained.;
, If you’re traveling with a group of people, having some car-friendly games on hand can entertain you and everyone else. Easily portable games include Trivial Pursuit (you can keep track of who’s winning by tracking how many correct answers each person gets), Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity., Having portable technology with you can help keep you entertained, too. Bring a tablet or e-reader, or even a portable DVD player. You can also pack a music player (like an iPod) or portable gaming device, or even your laptop. Bringing your smartphone can also keep you occupied.If you bring the DVD player, remember to bring DVDs.
Don't forget headphones!

, You might feel hungry when you’re bored, and this is especially true on long car rides. Pack healthy snacks to keep yourself full without feeling heavy.A small bag of veggies that are easy to eat in the car - like carrots and peppers - are an easy and healthy snack.
String cheese is easy to pack and a better option than fast food. You can also pack small bags of nuts like almonds and cashews.

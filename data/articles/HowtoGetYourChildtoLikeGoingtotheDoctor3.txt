 If you are tense, nervous, or fearful you may inadvertently encourage these emotions in your child. Even if your child has misbehaved at the doctor's office in the past stay confident that this time everything will go perfectly.
 Taking a child to the doctor's office is part of the work you need to do to socialize them into life as a member of a community. Remember that they are learning all sorts of social skills through this process, so be sure to compliment them when they behave the way you want them to, reinforcing the positive aspects of the experience.


For example, you could say, "You were so good today when you got your shot! I was very proud of how you held my hand and did not want to close your eyes. In fact, you were so brave I think we need to go get some ice cream to celebrate."

, While this is similar to giving them information, you won't know all the information you'll need to share until you have a sense of where their anxious minds and active imaginations have taken them. Ask them why they are scared, and let them know you will be with them, carefully watching, and that they will not be hurt by this experience.Remember that a trip to the doctor touches on most of the natural fears children have based on their psychological developmentâ€”it's natural for them to be anxious about it! Talk with them to put them at ease.
 Telling your child "It's not going to be that scary," might not feel comforting if your child is quite anxious and fearful already. Instead, get them to think about the experience in a different way by talking about how going to the doctor's office can help them feel better.


For example, you could say, "Getting your teeth scraped today is going to feel strange and unpleasant for a few minutes. But when those few minutes are up, your teeth are going to be healthier, a whole lot stronger, and clean and shiny--just like the people we see on television."

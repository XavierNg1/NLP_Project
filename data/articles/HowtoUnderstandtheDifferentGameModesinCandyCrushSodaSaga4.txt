 You can determine the game mode by going to the pre-game screen and viewing the goal of the level. From the game map, click or tap on a level to see its pre-game screen.
 Click or tap on the “Play” button to start the level. The main goal will again be displayed before you can begin.
 In this game mode, the number of chocolate bars on the board is indicated in the upper portion of the screen. This number is relatively useless as the chocolate bars spread after every move if you don’t take at least one out. You have to take all chocolate bars out of the board.
 Start playing the level. Focus on the targets, and do not just attack the game board. The chocolate bars can spread very quickly if you don’t manage them early on. Don’t let them. Take out at least one chocolate bar in every move. The sooner you take all of them out, the better it will be.


To remove the chocolate bars, make matches adjacent to them.
 Aside from the main goal, every level requires you to meet a certain minimum score to in order to move to the next level. If you’ve successfully completed the goal, but didn’t meet the required score, you will still lose the game. Go for huge combos and cascading matches to get some bonus scores.

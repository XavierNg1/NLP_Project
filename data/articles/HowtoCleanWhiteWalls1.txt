 Remove all artwork, pictures, or other items from a wall. Clear the space near the walls. Push furniture away from the walls, for example. As you'll be dusting, you should also cover your floor in a tarp to catch dust and debris as it falls., Take a broom and cover it with a towel. Use your broom to wipe the walls from top to bottom. Make sure to get into corners to remove things like cobwebs.For very dirty walls, go over the walls with the broom brush of your vacuum after dusting them off.
 Always go for a mild cleaner. With white walls, the lighter the cleaner the better. Mix a small amount of your cleaner into a bucket of warm water and then dip a sponge in the water. Run the sponge along the walls, wiping off dirt, debris, and fingerprints.Areas that are often touched should get extra attention. Give things like doorknobs and light switches an extra clean.
 Wring your sponge out before cleaning near outlets and telephone jacks. Using too much water can pose a hazard. Do not clean too close to outlets. If scrubbing these outlets is necessary, turn off your circuit breaker before doing so., After your walls are thoroughly clean, dump out your bucket. Replace the water with clear water. Take a clean sponge and dip it in your water. Wipe down the walls with clean water to rinse them. Again, be sure to be careful around outlets.

 Typically, trash talking involves boasting about your own excellence in whatever competitive event you’re engaged in. Be creative and make up boasts—whether funny or serious—about your skill.Say something like, “You’re already yesterday’s news.”Be prepared to back up your words with actions. If you’re playing basketball and claim to be able to make a shot from half court, you’ll need to prove that you can make the shot.
Don’t be immature or boast about skills you don’t have. For example, young teens are notorious for filling online gaming forums with juvenile humor and over-the-top boasts. To effectively talk trash, avoid these techniques.
 This is often done in a light-hearted way, or in a clever manner than uses jokes and creative criticism. You can use intimidation to make your opponent doubt their own skill at a game, or sufficiently distract them with your trash talk so they can no longer focus on the competition.For example, if you’re playing a competitive game of golf, try saying:


“I’ve seen better swings at my kid’s school playground.”If your opponent hits their ball into water, say, “Want me to hold your shoes and socks?”

, Successful trash talk often builds off of a funny premise.Humor can also be used to distract your opponents (no one plays well when they’re laughing) or to build up the comradery of your own team.


A quick-witted insult can surprise your opponent and leave them stunned.
Say something like, “If you ever even dream of beating me, you’d better wake up and apologize.”, If you feel that your trash talking is ineffective, it’s probably a good idea to stop. If you continue trash talking, you may start to look desperate or give the impression that you’re more skilled at running your mouth than at winning competitions.

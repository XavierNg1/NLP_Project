 Once bidding is over, the player left of the dealer leads to the first trick., Tricks are won by the highest trump in the trick, or the highest card overall., If a non-trump starts the play and the next player has the other non-trump card of that suit (e.g. Player 1 draws 10 of Spades, next player has Ace of Spades, so they must play it), then they must play that card. Otherwise, they must play a trump card and only trump cards higher than the highest trump of the current trick. If they can't, they can play any other trump card. If they have no trump cards, they can play any card.

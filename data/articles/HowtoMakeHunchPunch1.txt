 In a large container, empty an entire 750 ml bottle of Everclear or another type of clear grain alcohol with a neutral flavor. A single bottle is sufficient for a small party of 10 or less, but if you’re expecting a larger crowd, you’ll want to use two or three bottles.Traditionally, hunch punch is mixed in a 5 gallon (19 l) cooler. If using one, make sure that it’s clean before pouring in the Everclear.;
, Once the Everclear is in the container, add 1 gallon (3.8 l) of fruit punch. Use a long-handled spoon to mix the punch together to ensure that the fruit punch is fully blended with the alcohol.You can use a bottle of ready-made fruit punch or mix up your own using powdered drink packets. Just make sure that it adds up to 1 gallon of fruit punch.
If you’re using additional bottles of Everclear in the punch, you’ll need to add more fruit punch as well. For every 750 ml bottle of alcohol, mix in 1 gallon (3.8 l) of the fruit punch.
 When the Everclear and fruit punch are completely mixed, add as much ice as desired to chill the punch. Use a ladle to pour the punch into cups and serve.If you don’t want to use ice, you can refrigerate the fruit punch overnight to chill it before adding it to the alcohol.

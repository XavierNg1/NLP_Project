 Add ½ cup (63 g) of all-purpose flour, ½ cup (65 g) of whole wheat flour, ¼ cup (25 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons (25 g) of sugar, 3 teaspoons (12 g) of baking powder, and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt to a large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they are fully combined.You can use all whole wheat flour in the pancakes if you prefer.
 After you’ve mixed the dry ingredients, make a well in the center of it with a clean finger. Add 1 cup (237 ml) of milk, 1 egg, and a ripe avocado that’s been peeled, pitted, and mashed to the well, and then mix the liquid ingredients in until the batter is just combined., After the pancake batter is just combined, add ⅓ cup (60 g) of chocolate chips. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the chips in without overmixing.You can use any type of chocolate chip that you like, including semi sweet, bittersweet, and milk.
Cinnamon chips can add an interesting flavor to the pancakes too.
 Place a large skillet on the stove, and add a small amount of butter. Heat the pan on medium to melt the butter and grease the skillet.If you prefer, you can spray the pan with nonstick cooking spray to grease it.
 Once the pan is hot and greased, pour your desired amount of batter in a round shape. Allow the pancakes to cook for several minutes or until bubbles appear in the surface.If you want to create different shaped pancakes, place metal cookie cutters in the skillet and pour the batter inside them.
 When the pancakes are finished cooking on the first side, use a wide spatula to flip them to the other side. Let the pancakes cook for another 2 to 3 minutes on the other side, or until they are golden brown., When the pancakes are finished cooking, transfer them from the skillet to a plate. Serve the pancakes immediately with butter, syrup, or your other favorite pancake toppings.

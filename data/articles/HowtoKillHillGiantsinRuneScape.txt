There's a spot at level 16 through 19 Wilderness, but it's far from a bank.



 


Another spot Hill Giants are located is the Wilderness Fire Giant Dungeon. It is located deep in the Wilderness--level 52. Note that this area is available only to members.






The spot inside of the Tree Gnome Village Maze isn't used much for killing Hill Giants. It is mostly near the bottom-half of the maze. This area is only available to members.






The spot southwest of the Tree Gnome Stronghold isn't used much either. It's often secluded, and it is available only to members.






Another spot Hill Giants are located is in the Taverley Dungeon, south of Taverley. There are many other high-levelled monsters in the Taverley dungeon, so be cautious. This spot is only for members.






There are also Hill Giants in the Edgeville Dungeon. This is a very popular place to train, and you will usually find players here training Slayer. It's also nearby the Grand Exchange and the Edgeville bank.;
, The best food is fish. There's a fishing spot near Edgeville Dungeon in the Barbarian village. You will need at least 20 Fishing to catch fish there.
 Hill Giants use a crush attack, so get something that is not weak to crush attacks.
 Pick up the drops.

 Let dry.
 This weatherproofs the wreath for outdoor/front door use.
 Face the candy corn all the same way and don't leave gaps between the joins.
 Go all the way around the circle.


There will be gaps left in between rows; this is not to be worried about, as the black paint will show through nicely.
 Alternate the row direction for the candy corn until you gradually reach the center of the wreath form.
 Let dry.
 This part is optional but adds an extra touch. Ideas for this include:


Black ribbon bows.
Black artificial or paper flowers with a rhinestone for the flower centers.
Black cat, witch or broomstick.
Anything else you like.
 A double sided loop will help it to hang evenly.
 Hang the wreath on the door.

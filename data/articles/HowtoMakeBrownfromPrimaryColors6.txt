 The primary colors are red, blue, and yellow.
 The secondary colors are created by mixing two primary colors. The colors that are created when you mix two colors together appear between the primary colors on the color wheel. Therefore, red and blue make purple, yellow and red make orange, and yellow and blue make green.
 The complimentary colors are simply colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. This means that they are of opposite hues in the color model, and should mix to produce a neutral color of white, gray, or black if they are mixed in the proper proportion.
 To create brown, you'll simply have to mix the following complimentary colors:


Mix orange (from yellow and red) with its complimentary color, blue (Method one, steps 1-3)
Mix green (from yellow and blue) with its complimentary color, red (Method two, steps 1-3)
Mix purple (from red and blue) with its complimentary color, yellow (Method three, steps 1-3)

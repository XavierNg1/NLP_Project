 Preheat the oven to 180ºC, 350ºF or gas mark 4.;
, Spoon the butter into the mixer bowl and turn it on to "blend". Slowly add the icing sugar and let it blend until the sugar has fully mixed in. Then add the ground walnuts and the flour, allowing each batch of flour to be fully combined before adding the next. Blend for 1 minute more and then turn off the mixer.
 Place a sheet of cling film (plastic food wrap) onto a flat surface and lay the dough at the bottom part of the sheet.


Shape and stretch the dough into a log-shape and move it back and forth to make a cylinder shape with the film wrapped around the log.






Finally, twist the ends of the cling film as if you are making a cracker.
Repeat the process of making another cylinder with the rest of the dough.
 The dough needs to be chilled before you can cut it. Place your two logs into the fridge until cold (at least half an hour, probably longer).
 Remove the logs from the fridge and slice them in half. Take off the cling film and discard. Then cut into 1⁄2 centimeter (0.2 in) rounds. Repeat with the rest of the logs until you have roughly 80 small cookies.
 Line the baking tray (cookie sheet) with wax paper and put the cookies onto the tray, ensuring that there is enough space between each biscuit to expand during the cooking process. Then transfer them to the preheated oven. Bake for 10 minutes.
 Allow the cookies to cool before serving. Dust them generously with icing sugar and place them on a pretty plate to serve with a good quality tea or coffee.

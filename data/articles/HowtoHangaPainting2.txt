 For heavier paintings, wire is a better way to hang them than just one ring on the back of the frame. Make a rough judgment about how heavy the painting is as this will determine the strength of wire you need. You can buy wire that will hold up a 100 lb (45 kg) painting. Attach a d-ring to each top corner on the back and string the wire through the hooks.








The point of this is that now the weight of the painting is distributed across two rings and a wire, rather than all being on a single ring.
 Paintings should be hung at eye level. The way to accomplish this is to measure the length of the painting and divide that by two. Add 60 inches (152 cm) to this. Using that number, make a small mark on the wall at that height.








For example, if your painting is 36 inches (91 cm), then half of it would be 18 inches (45.7 cm). So the hanger for the painting should be at roughly 78 inches (198 cm).
 Heavy paintings are not meant to be hung with a single small nail. Use a curved hook which you press into the wall and that braces against the inside of the wall. Another good option is to use a stud finder to sink a larger nail, perhaps a 10d or 12d, into a stud rather than only into the drywall or plaster.Depending on the size and weight of the painting, it is often advised to use two hooks or nails. This braces the painting even more. Split the width of the painting into thirds and put the hangers at those points.
For plaster walls, you may want to drill a hole first and then use a screw that has a plastic sleeve which expands when you screw it into the wall.
 Gently hang the wire onto the hook or screws that are in the wall. With heavy paintings, you want to hang them slowly to make sure that the hangers are going to stay. It can be good to set a level on top of the painting to see if it is hanging straight.









Large paintings will look more natural if you put some smaller ones around them to balance out the largeness.

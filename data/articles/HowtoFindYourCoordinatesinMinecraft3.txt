 Minecraft PE does not have the craftable Map in the game, and there is no way to check your current coordinates. In order to see your current coordinates, you'll need a third-party tool. iOS devices will need to be jailbroken in order to use these apps.


Android - Download PocketInvEditor from the Google Play Store.
iOS - Download iMCPEdit from Cydia. Your device will need to be jailbroken in order for this app to work.
 In order for the third-party app to load your world information, you'll need to make sure that Minecraft PE is not currently running. Open your recent apps screen and swipe Minecraft PE closed.
 You'll see a list of all of your saved worlds. Select the one that you want to check your current coordinates for. If it doesn't load, make sure that Minecraft PE is not currently running.
 This will display information about your current world.
 These are your player coordinates. When you start this world again, you'll be starting from this location.
 There are three coordinates in Minecraft PE: X, Y, and Z.


"X" is your longitude. If X is positive, you're to the east of your starting block. If X is negative, you're to the west.
"Y" is your elevation. 63 is sea level, and 0 is bedrock.
"Z" is your latitude. If Z is positive, you're south of the starting block. If Z is negative, you're north of the starting block.

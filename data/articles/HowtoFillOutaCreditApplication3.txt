 There are 3 major types of credit cards. They are cards that help you build or repair your credit, cards that save money on interest, and cards that offer you rewards. The best card for you depends on your current needs.If you are trying to build your credit, you do not need to apply for a card that offers cashback or travel rewards. Apply for a secured card or a student credit card (if it applies to you).
To save money on interest, look for a low interest, 0% APR, or a balance transfer card.
If you plan to pay off your balance in full every month, you may want a rewards card. These cards have a higher APR rate, but have many benefits.
 Once you have determined the type of card you need, shop around to find the best deal. Start looking at your current bank or credit union. You may be able to get a better deal because you are an existing customer. Take your search online after that. Check each credit card for the following things:APR
APR for balance transfers

Penalty APR (How much? How long does it last? What initiates it?)
Fees (e.g. annual fee, cash advance fee, late-payment fee, and balance transfer fee)

, You may find two or three cards that meet your needs. Examine each card for differences. Nerdwallet has a tool that lets you do side-by-side comparisons of different cards.Things that you should look depend on the type of card you have:For low-interest cards look for late fees, the change in the APR after initial period, and the length of the APR period.
For secured and credit cards look for credit limit increases for making timely payments.
If you are using a balance rewards card look for an expiration date to use your rewards.

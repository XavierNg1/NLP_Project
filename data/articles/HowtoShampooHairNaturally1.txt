 Add ¼ cup (59 ml) of water, ¼ cup (59 ml) of liquid castile soap, and ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of light vegetable oil to a bowl. Use a spoon to stir the mixture together until it’s fully blended.For the best results, use filtered or distilled water.
If you have oily hair, omit the vegetable oil.;
, Once the shampoo is fully mixed, place a funnel in the top of a squeeze bottle. Pour the shampoo through the funnel to add it to the bottle for storage.The recipe makes 4 ounces (118 ml) of shampoo. Make sure that your squeeze bottle can hold at least that much.
If you don’t want to purchase a new squeeze bottle, use the container from an old store-bought shampoo. Just rinse it out first to remove any of the old shampoo.
 To wash your hair with the natural shampoo, wet your hair thoroughly with water. Squeeze a small amount of the shampoo into your hand, and massage it into your hair at the scalp to form a lather. Rinse the shampoo with cool water.Follow up the shampoo with a conditioner to ensure that your hair is properly hydrated.

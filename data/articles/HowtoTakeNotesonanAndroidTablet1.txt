 A Stylus is a pen-like object included with some Android tablets, like the Samsung Galaxy tabs. This can be found lodged along the sides of your device for easy access. Slide out the Stylus of your tablet and tap its screen with the Stylus.


If your Android Tablet does not come with a stylus, you can make your own]].;
, Tap the pre-installed application on your tablet called “Notes” or “Memo.” It should be the one with a notepad icon. A notepad will then appear on your screen.
 Tap the plus “+” icon on the top left-hand corner of the Notes application screen to create a fresh new draft page.
 Using your Stylus, start writing words on the screen of your tablet, just like you would on paper, and the app will display everything you’re scribbling.


You can also use your fingers too in lieu of the Stylus if you don’t have your tablet’s pen with you.
 Once you’re through writing your notes, tap the “Save” button on your tablet’s screen to save everything you’ve written down.

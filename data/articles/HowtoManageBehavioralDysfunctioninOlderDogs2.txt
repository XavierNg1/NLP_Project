 Most dogs over 10 years old suffer from CDS, which shares many similarities to human dementia. CDS has many symptoms, including confusion or disorientation, a decrease in responsiveness or recognition, changes in activity, changes in sleep patterns, and lapses in housetraining. If your dog shows any of these symptoms, take them to your veterinarian for assessment and diagnosis.There are a number of medications that your veterinarian may recommend that have been shown to improve your dog’s cognitive function.
 If your dog is showing symptoms of CDS, changing its diet may improve its cognitive abilities. A diet rich in antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids may improve your dog’s behavior. Look for dog foods that advertise high levels of either antioxidants or omega-3 fatty acids.Feed your dog fruits and vegetables such as spinach, carrots, oranges, lemons, and tomatoes. However, make sure that you too do not feed them too many fresh fruits and vegetables. Talk with your veterinarian about how much to feed your dog.

Giving your dog fish oil is a great way to make sure that it gets omega-3 fatty acids.
Your veterinarian may also recommend that you feed your dog antioxidant and omega-3 fatty acid supplements.
 Keeping your dog physically active is one of the best ways to prevent CDS and improve cognitive function in older dogs. Be sure to exercise your dog every day and play with it regularly. It is also important that you continue to train your dog and teach it new tricks.
 Providing your dog with new and stimulating experiences may also improve your dog’s brain function. Buy your dog new and complicated toys, such as dog puzzles. Take them to new places and introduce your dog to new animals and people.However, if your dog shows any signs of distress or anxiety around unfamiliar people or pets, be sure to remove them from the situation.

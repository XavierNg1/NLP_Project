 When you bring your cat in, you'll need to give information about the cat's symptoms, particularly when the cat started exhibiting the problem. You also should note if you saw anything that could have caused the problem, such as an injury. If your cat has been exposed to ticks, you should note that as well., The vet will begin with a physical exam, where they will check your cat from nose to tail, focusing on the problem area. Often the vet may need to gently restrain the cat to examine it., The vet will need to perform these tests to help narrow down the problem. The vet may take blood and urine samples to be sent for testing. The vet may also take an x-ray to see if the problem is physical (in the spine).The vet may also take CT scans or MRIs or perform a biopsy.
If the cat has experienced trauma, then the vet will likely assume the condition is related, and diagnostic tests like x-rays will help the vet see the nature of the injury. Similarly, it could be a back problem, such as a slipped disc or a blood clot, which an x-ray will also help determine.
For other problems, such as diabetic problems and tick poisoning, blood and urine tests will help narrow down the issue. If your vet suspects a or finds a tumor, they'll likely use a biopsy to tell if it is benign.
 When a cat is first having problems in its back legs, a hospital visit is likely in order, especially if the cat is having trouble doing things like going to the bathroom. In the hospital, the vet can observe and diagnose the cat.

 Locate the app on your device and tap on it. The app icon has a green document or file icon on it.


You won’t need to sign in, unless this is your first time to use the app.
 All your Google spreadsheets, those you own and those shared with you, will be displayed. Swipe through the list and find the spreadsheet you’d like to open.
 Tap the spreadsheet you want to view. It will be opened on your screen.
 Search can be accessed from the menu. Tap the button with three vertical dots on the top right corner to bring out the menu. Tap “Find and Replace” from here, and a header search box will appear at the top of your spreadsheet.
 Enter the word, number, or string you want to look for in the search box. Tap the Search key on your keypad to begin.
 If a match is found, the first cell containing the match will be highlighted and you will be brought to it.


On the rightmost part of the header search box are two arrow buttons. The upward button goes to the previous match and the downward button goes to the next match. Tap the downward button to go to the next cell containing the match. Continue tapping this button to go through the matches until you find the data you’re looking for.
 When you’re done, tap the “X” button in front of the header search box to exit the search function and go back to your spreadsheet.

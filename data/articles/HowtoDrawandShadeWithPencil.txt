 This does not have to be perfect, so don't make it perfect. Think of it as guidelines, not laws. Sketch it lightly. If you sketch too dark, there will be lines that you do not want in the finished drawing.;
, Remember to make this very light; you'll be darkening it later. 'Flesh out' your character or design by adding the layers like skin, fur, clothing, etc. Add the outlines.
 Making them dark will ensure that they stay in the paper when you erase anything you don't need. But don't make them too dark, yet!

, Right now, you don't need to worry about light source. Adding a small bit of shading on every cross section of the lines gives it depth and weight. This process is often called 'weighting' a picture. It can make the difference between a flat image and an image that pops out at you.


This makes the difference between picture one and picture two at right:

, Do it lightly and in small strokes; the best way to shade is in layers


Some people sketch a small circle or other object to indicate the light source. This can be a good method if you aren't handy at visualizing where the light is coming from.
 Using a tissue or the tip of your finger, press on the shading and smudge is to lay it out evenly. Don't worry about getting it over a larger area than you need or out of the lines; you'll be erasing mistakes later.
, This process can take a few minutes or days depending on how much you want to do it.
 Add extra highlights for an even shinier look.
 Forget anything? Need more shading in a certain area? Add any finishing details. Done.

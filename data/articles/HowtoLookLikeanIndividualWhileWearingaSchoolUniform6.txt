 Putting pin badges of your favourite bands or phrases can come across as a bit childish, they are also not fashionable and most schools will not allow it. Iron-on/sew-on patches also come across as childish and most schools don't allow it.


Make sure your school allows you to do this, or you could risk getting in trouble.

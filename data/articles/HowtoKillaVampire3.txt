 Many nations used them as training rounds, though rumors abound that they were meant to splinter inside the victim. This creates the possibility that your vampire could die when one of these splinters pierces its heart., The explosive won't necessarily kill the vampire, but the flash could produce enough light to cause the vampire to disintegrate., If the vampire doesn't like light, but you are stuck in the dark, you may be able to use technologies that generate powerful lights.An ultraviolet laser can use concentrated UV rays that create glare. Even more useful to the would-be killer, the glare also prevents the victim from seeing the direction of the beam. This means you can attack from any angle.
A flashlight or battery-powered lantern can be effective if the goal is to use brightness. A military-grade flashlight is probably preferred, but you'll have to decide how powerful or concentrated the light will need to be.
 Because the cross is more important for symbolic reasons, an item or setting that looks like a cross (such as the shadow of a windmill in the film "Brides of Dracula") can defeat a vampire.

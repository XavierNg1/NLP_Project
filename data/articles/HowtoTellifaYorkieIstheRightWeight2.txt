 A counter-top or table is a good idea. Cover it with a cloth or towel for protection of the surface, but make sure nothing is to slippery.
 This can be done by grooming or pinning the dog's hair out of the way.
 Make sure the dog is relaxed.
 Start at the dog's upper ribs and go down their body. If you cannot feel the where the dog's rib cage ends. Or you can't even feel the dog's ribs this is an indication of an overweight or obese dog.
 Yorkies usually only have a very small area that could even be called a waist.


If the waist is to big or easily felt then the dog is probably underweight.
If the waist is to small or cannot be felt then the dog is probably overweight.
If you have trouble telling what is normal ask your vet to show you, so that you know for sure.

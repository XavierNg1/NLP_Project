Put your plug in the bath and fill with a perfect, warm not hot or cold, touch of clean water.
If you have some nice smelling oil, this is the perfect thing to add a nice smell to it - resulting in you smelling nice too.
Fetch a clean flannel and dip with water.
First clean your hands. Rub in a smooth circular motion with your eyes closed. While you do this, imagine that you are swimming in the sea, all the grime being washed away by the tide. As you do so, dip your hands deeper into the water, and swish them around. Then imagine you are climbing out onto soft sands...
Lay a towel on the floor and step out, imagining that the towel is soft sands.;

Pour both contents of nail varnish into a small pot, and gently stir the contents until it goes the colour you want it. But beware! As you have used two nail varnishes, the result is bound to be a little gloppy and thick so put a little water in too (accuracy?), to stop it making your nails 1 inch of your finger!

, This will not only feel refreshing, this will refresh you. If you don't like cucumbers, don't worry you don't have to eat them, but if you really want, just use one of those eye mask thingies instead.
As soon as you have done this, mash some grapes and use the insides as a face mask. Just scoop it up and spread over your face.
Keep this on for at least 10 minutes, then wash off using cold, cold water. (No, not hot, it HAS to be cold!) This is exactly what you need if you don't eat enough greens!

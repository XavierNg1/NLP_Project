 Aerial attacks and smashes are extremely useful for amassing damage on your opponent. When they have a fair enough amount of damage, you can force them off an edge and use either a charged B or a smash to keep them there.

Well, that's a bit vague, nearly all worthwhile characters have a big air game due to complete cancellation of lag made by shuffling (see the related article here or preferably on smash boards) and most characters rely on smashes for KOs. a charged b is predictable, use c-stick smashes. yes, you're going to say they're cheap, but not to anyone who tries to use "advanced techniques". search the advanced how to play video on YouTube or go to smash boards to find out everything I've said here and more.
 One example is to jump forward and use your b to charge up a little and deal a good bit of damage. But remember, the only way this is a good strategy is if it is unexpected. So use sparingly (not a lot)., An easy yet effective strategy is to use Marth's nair (neutral air). It's large hitbox, double slashing, and quick execution is an excellent approach used by both Marth newcomers and pros, Momentum is your efficiency in combat. Performing combos is the most common way to improve momentum, but there is a better way. If you can't seem to get "in the groove" of a fight, and the enemy has more momentum, try to disrupt him instead of trying to immediately get him with combos and such. Get him off of his game, and then you can worry about getting back on yours. You aren't going to beat him if his momentum is greater, so stop him, then you will be able to build your own.

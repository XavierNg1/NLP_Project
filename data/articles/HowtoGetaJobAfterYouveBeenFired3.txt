 Getting fired feels awful, and venting to friends or family can help make you feel better. It’s okay to feel sad, angry, and embarrassed – sometimes all at the same time. Recognize that those are legitimate feelings and then let them go., If you volunteer at organizations related to what you do, you can fill a gap in your resume and stay involved in your field. It will also show potential employers that you are passionate about your work, since you volunteered to do it even when you weren’t being paid.Volunteering is also a great way to build up skills that are maybe a little lacking. It beefs up your resume and increases your chances of getting hired again.
 Think about the reasons your previous employer gave for firing you. Are they things you can work on? Was it something you had no control over? Then decide if it has changed your career goals or interests. Getting fired from a job is a good time to reevaluate where you’re at in your career and where you want to go., You’re not the first or last person to ever get fired. It happens to a lot of people, even if they’re great at what they do. Getting fired doesn’t mean you’re a failure – it just means that particular opportunity wasn’t working out.

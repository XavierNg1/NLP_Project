 Albus Dumbledore was kind to a young orphan, to elves, to a hippogriff and even to Voldemort, he respected and protected their feelings. Make sure that you also treat people and animals with kindness, love and dignity.
 Just like Hermione, Albus Dumbledore was smart, so smart that he was called the most powerful wizard. He learnt everything he could and so should you.
 Though Dumbledore never explicitly taught classes in Hogwarts during Harry Potter's time, he did teach Harry many things and mentored not only him, but also indirectly Ron, Hermione and the rest of Hogwarts.
 He risked and gave up his life for the greater good. He never shied away from protecting the weak and innocent and stood up for what was right.
 Dumbledore did make many grave mistakes in his life like befriending Grindelwald which lead to his sister's demise. But he understood that he was all but a wizard and learnt from them. He redefined himself from his losses and distanced from hate.
 Dumbledore understood that most bad people have goodness hiding in them. He gave them his trust and a second chance to redeem themselves.
 He realized that a good laugh could fix things.

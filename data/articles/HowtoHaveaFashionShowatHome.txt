 You can ask them to bring/wear additional clothes, coats, accessories, and shoes for the Fashion Show. Just Pretend they're wearing the clothes that you made.;
, Choose and area to create a backdrop. One easy backdrop is a sheet tacked to the wall or tucked into a closet door. Perhaps add a chair, hat rack or a nice plants in your backdrop area. Lay another sheet on the floor to complete the set. It should be near an area where your modeling guests can change outfits in private, and not in a high-traffic area such as entryway or bathroom.
 Some lamps can be pointed at the backdrop, to light up the fashion models.
, Let everyone who isn't modeling get their cameras ready and then turn up the music for the Fashion Show! Take turns posing for the camera. When your turn is over, go change quickly into another outfit and get back in line to model your second look.
 If you're lucky you may just land a job modelingÂ ;) good luck:)

 Mail.


A lot of people use Yahoo! Mail just for signing up for things they don't want to be spammed by, and since Yahoo! Mail is not JavaScript based, it is faster on most computers.
Yahoo! Mail has a new version in limited beta in which they are turning the interface into a more desktop like one.
One problem is that Yahoo! has large banner ads and adds an advertisement onto your emails, however you can press an arrow which hides them.
Another good things about Yahoo! is that you get unlimited space.

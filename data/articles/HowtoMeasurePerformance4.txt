 One way to measure time management is to assess the time and employee spends on a project. However, you should only use those measures that can be collected automatically such as time cards or computer software. For most jobs, manual reporting, such as entering data into a timesheet, is neither reliable nor cost-effective.


There are multiple software programs that can track what is being done on a computer. This way, you can investigate employees who are not meeting performance standards to see what they are having trouble with.
If specific employees are falling far below the average, they can be singled-out and helped to meet the performance requirements.
 While feedback is important, daily monitoring is a two-edged sword that can be a morale buster. It also shifts performance responsibilities from management to a tool. It's better to use weekly or monthly measures. In addition, use bonuses instead of humiliation to encourage employees, and keep individual performance figures confidential.
 One manner of measuring performance is to make note of how an employee adheres to company policies. To monitor these lapses, try the following methods:]

Monitor punctuality issues. Employees who are habitually late are naturally missing minutes they could be working. Whatâ€™s worse, they could be upsetting other employees.
Check for dress code violations. An employee that is relaxed on their professional appearance is likely to exhibit the same approach to their actual work.Clarify usage of workplace items. Be sure employees know how and when they may use company items like a car, cell phone, or computer. Employees abusing company materials are not using time wisely.

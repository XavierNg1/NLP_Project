, You'll be bored your whole wikiBreak if you don't come up with ideas of how to spend it. Plan meetups with friends, go for a swim or water fight, or do something else you find fun. (Read the next section for more ideas.)

, Go for a swim, have a water fight, or do any other water activity. Water activities are great ways to have fun! This is especially great if your wikiBreak takes place during the summer.
 Yes, everyone needs a vacation sometimes. Choose a great destination including Hawaii, Paris, London or Maui. Look at trip deals and pricing for hotels and accommodation. Also look for excellent attractions or restaurants that you may want to visit.
 Spend some money on the things you want. You can buy clothes, jewelry, chocolate, or any other things you'd like.
 Plan to go out for breakfast, lunch, dinner or coffee. You can also do something else together (such as the fun ideas mentioned above.)

, If you haven't been active on other online sites, remember to access them, and acknowledge that wikiHow isn't the only site on the Internet. Watch videos, play games, or do something else fun and non-wikiHow related online.


If you find an interesting site that provides account creation, join that site! It's a great way to make friends and get involved.
Build up on skills that you feel you need to improve on. Websites for that include IXL, Academics and Social Skill Builder.
 Make a board game and play it, look for games online, or make up your own. Playing a game is a good way to stay entertained. If you don't want to make a board game, you can play an already-made one. Board games to play include Scrabble, Chess and Sorry.
 Talk about the things you like, such as what you've been doing. You can also tell them about wikiHow and your contributions, but you might be tempted to stop your wikiBreak early. If you want a distraction from wikiHow, it's best not to do this.

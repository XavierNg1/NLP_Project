 Bumper mounted fog lights are typically below the headlights. Check your vehicle manual if you have difficulty locating them.
 This disconnects the fog light from the vehicle’s power system. It should disconnect by detaching the clip.
 This will allow you to remove the fog light housing. Make sure that you hold on to all your parts until the installation is complete.
 Be careful not to scratch the bumper. If you are installing grille or roof-mounted lights, lift away from the vehicle to be sure to avoid scratching the roof or body.
 The housing should fit into the space left by the old one. If it does not, you may have purchased the incorrect headlights.


Make sure that the bolt holes line up; otherwise you may have to drill new ones.
 Thread the washer and nut over the bolt, tightening with a ratchet or wrench. Do not over tighten as you may damage the fog light housing or the vehicle. The housing should be snug and immobile.
 Reconnect the fog light switch using the clip. The new fog light should now be properly powered by the vehicle’s battery.
 Test your new lights. Ensure that the angle is good for visibility and won’t shine in other drivers’ eyes.

 Get an egg timer or use the timer/alarm feature on your iPhone. If you can't remember yourself and you can't get someone else to remember for you, get a machine to do it. This alarm, provided that you set it correctly, will remind you to let your pet back inside. This works better for dogs, as they tend to stay outside for shorter periods of time.


Set the timer on your stove.
Get a stopwatch with a timer, and keep it in your pocket.
If you get absorbed in the internet or a computer game, set a notification on your primary device.
 In the case that you don't have someone that can help you, stay with your pet. Your pet is your responsibility. If you cannot find another way to make sure your pet does not get locked out, you will need to stay with him.


On very cold days, or extremely hot days, this is especially important.
During times when it is unbearable for you to be outside, it will likely also be unbearable for your pet.
To lock your pet out in these conditions can cause harm or even death from exposure to the elements.
 Teaching a dog to bark or cat to meow when he wants to come in can be time consuming, but it will empower your pet, and it can help you remember to let him in. Many pets will naturally make noise when they want to come in. Some will not. In this case, it may be worth it to train them to let you know.


Be careful not to bother your neighbors.
Don't let your pet cry or bark for an hour at the door.
Install a baby monitor outside, so you can hear your pet better.
 If you're always forgetting, try asking someone you live with for help. Roommates or family members can help remind you to let your pet back in. They might even let your pet back in for you, if you ask nicely.


Offer to trade chores.
Do something nice for them for helping you.
Explain that it is for the good of the dog.

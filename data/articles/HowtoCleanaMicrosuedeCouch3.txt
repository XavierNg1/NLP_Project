Make sure not to use the power attachment because it can damage the fabric.If your S couch has dirt on it, you need to vacuum it first.
 If your couch has an S or W/S, you can use a solvent-based cleaner. You can try a commercial solvent upholstery cleaner, which usually comes in a foam.If your couch has an S, only use solvent-based cleaners and do not use water.
 Rubbing alcohol, or clear drinking alcohol like vodka, can be used to clean a microsuede couch. Put the alcohol into a spray bottle and spray it on the stains on your couch.Blot or gently rub the stains with a cloth.
 If you cannot use water on your couch, try using a dry detergent on the stains. Sprinkle some of the product onto the area. Leave it on as long as directed. Use a soft-bristle brush to work the dry detergent over the stain.After you have cleaned the section, vacuum up the dry detergent before working on the next section.

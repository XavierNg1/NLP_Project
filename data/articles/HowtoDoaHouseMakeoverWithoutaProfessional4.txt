 The best way to liven up a bedroom is to get a new set of sheets. Changing the bed set two or three times a year can keep the bedroom looking fresh and prevent feelings of boredom with the space., A headboard placed behind the bed can add a sense of luxury to your bedroom. If you donâ€™t want to add a headboard, get an adhesive wall covering that creates the illusion of a headboard instead.Alternately, hang a quilt or tapestry behind the bed to provide a center for the bedroom space., If possible, add a makeup console to the bedroom. This will allow you to avoid stashing all your makeup in your bathroom cabinet. You could also add a small desk so that you have a space to work and set up your laptop.

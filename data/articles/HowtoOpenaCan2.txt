 Set the can opener wheel onto the outer rim of the can lid. For some can openers, the wheel is designed to rest on the top of the can, in the groove next to the lip. In others, the wheel will be on the outside of the can, and a flat metal piece will rest in the top groove instead.


If your opener has no wheel, see the tips section below.
On some electric can openers, you will need to lift a protective flap first to reveal the wheel.
 If you are using a hand-operated can opener, close the arms of the can opener together tightly. You should hear a hiss or puncture noise as the wheel punches through the metal.


For an electronic can opener, just hit the On button instead. Some models will even detect the can and start opening it automatically.
 Keep one hand on the arms of the can opener, holding them tight. With your other hand, rotate the bar or key handle on the outside of the can opener. This should cause the can opener to move around the entire rim of the can, with the toothed wheel cutting through the metal as it moves.


You might find it easier to handle the food inside if you leave a small piece of the lid rim uncut. This allows you to use a fork to pry up the open end of the lid and bend it backward, instead of trying to dig out the lid after it's fallen into the food.

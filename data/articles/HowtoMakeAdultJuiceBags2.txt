 Make sure that the bottom of the bag is supported on a flat surface so it can easily receive the beverage without spilling over.
 Fill each bag two-thirds to three quarters of the way up.


Don’t overfill! The freezing process will likely expand your drink, which can cause an overfilled bag to burst and leave an unappetizing icy lump in your freezer.
 Make sure you run your finger over the seal several times to ensure no holes exist in the top.


One way to test the bag is to carefully dangle it upside down in the sink.
 Lay the bag flat on a shelf in the freezer so it doesn’t freeze into an odd shape.


Repeat for each bag you're preparing.
 Or, just keep a supply on hand for when company calls, or for beach days.
 You may need to wait a few minutes before the frozen cocktail will break down enough to admit the straw; keep pushing until there is some give.
 Lie back and enjoy your adult juice bag!

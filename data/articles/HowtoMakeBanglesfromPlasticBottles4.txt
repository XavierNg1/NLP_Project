 This can be from almost any source, so don't hold back. You could make bangles that match your entire wardrobe! Fabric sources include:


Scrap fabric or new fabric
Ribbon
Lace
Old clothing
Old house linen
Handkerchiefs, etc.
, You can either wrap the fabric around and around the bangle, creating neat overlap lines; or, you can carefully wrap the entirety of the bangle, gluing into the middle of the inside of the bangle.


Glue the starting end, then every few wraps of the fabric with the first way, then glue the finishing end.
If wrapping the entirety, roll glue over the bangle first, then glue at the join of the fabric. Add a length of ribbon or scrap fabric over the join, to neaten, and glue in place.
 If the fabric looks great on its own, you don't need to do this. Otherwise, consider gluing or sewing on beads, buttons, jewelry pieces, feathers, etc.
 The fabric-covered bangle is now ready to wear.

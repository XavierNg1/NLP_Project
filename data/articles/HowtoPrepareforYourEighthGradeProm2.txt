 Prom dresses with fitted tops, as well as full or a-line skirts, are recommended.  If you are comfortable with your larger behind, go for prom dresses that are a bit more form-fitting.
 If you have a slim figure, the illusion of curves can be achieved by drawing attention to your bust line, or a prom dress that bells out.  Also, you might try prom dresses that draw attention to your waist, such as a wrap dress or one with a belt.
 You can play up what you have by choosing from prom dresses with a gorgeous neckline. However, you should look for prom dresses with fuller coverage so you can make sure you have adequate support. 


If you want to draw attention away from your chest, look for prom dresses that attract the eye to the hem.
 If you are petite, show a small part of your leg; go with an asymmetrical hemline or a long fitted solid prom dress to make you appear taller.  Floor-length ball gowns tend to overwhelm your frame.  Long ruffles can also add the illusion of height.
 You have a naturally well proportioned body, which means that you don't need to disguise anything. Almost every style prom dress will flatter your figure. Have fun with it!

, For an apple shaped body, prom dresses with an empire waist will help draw attention from your middle. Also, a higher waistline means that the prom dress may not be as tight in your problem area. If you have nice and athletic legs, you might try to show them off by looking at shorter prom dresses.

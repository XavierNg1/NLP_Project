 Being a member of all three credit bureaus allows you to report directly to them, without paying a middleman. In order to be accepted as a member of one of the three (or all three) national credit bureau agencies, you must have a certain number of customer payment histories and a specified minimum number of open accounts with debtors. This could be as many as 500. Otherwise, you will have to choose one of the methods listed elsewhere in this article., If you qualify, ask them to send you an application. Submit your application and wait for an approval.
 You will now be able to submit reports directly to a credit bureau. Keep in mind that the costs you incur through the credit bureaus will amount to less than those charged by collection agencies and credit reporting agencies.

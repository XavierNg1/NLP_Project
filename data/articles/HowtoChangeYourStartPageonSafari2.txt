 There is no way to set a traditional start page in Safari, as it simply picks up where you last left off. If you'd prefer that Safari always load a specific page when you start it, you can create a shortcut to that page on your Home screen and launch Safari using it instead of the regular app.
 This can be any page that you'd like.
 You can then give the shortcut a custom title, or adjust the exact address. Tap "Add" when you're finished making changes.
 Every time you tap your shortcut, it will load that page instead of the last page you were using in Safari. This is a great way to get around teh lack of a traditional homepage.

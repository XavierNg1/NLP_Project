 For this variation of the knotted ponytail, you will only be adding one “knot.” This version can be created with any length hair, as long as it’s long enough to be put into a ponytail! Feel free to keep a part in your hair or brush all of your hair back. You can put your hair into a high ponytail, a low ponytail, or a side ponytail – place your ponytail wherever you prefer it. Hold the ponytail firmly in one hand.

, While you hold your ponytail firmly with one hand, use your other hand to grab a strand of hair out from the ponytail. Grab a small section, and begin wrapping it around the base of a ponytail very tightly. This strand of hair will actually act as your hair tie, or the “knot” that holds your ponytail in place. Continue wrapping the hair around the base of the ponytail until you’ve wrapped the entire strand.
 After you’ve wrapped the strand tightly around the base of your ponytail, you’ll need to pin it in place with a bobby pin. Choose a bobby pin that is the same color, or close to the same color, as your hair. You want it to be as invisible as possible. Then, open the bobby pin slightly and position it underneath your ponytail, so that it will be sliding upwards. Slide it up, so that it is securely holding the strand that is wrapped round the base of the ponytail.








You may need to use multiple bobby pins, especially if you have thick hair. Add as many bobby pins as you need until your ponytail feels secure.

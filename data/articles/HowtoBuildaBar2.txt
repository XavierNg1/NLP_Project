 The corner stiles of the front wall will need to be offset in order to form the corner joint and give the walls a solid look. The stile should overhang the panel by ¾”, such that the side of a similar board will be covered. Mark this placement but do not attach the stile.
 Place the top and bottom 54 ½” rails on the front panel, glueing them and then nailing them into place. Be sure to place the large rail at the bottom (where the nailing boards are located, if you chose to use them).
 Place three of the the 31 ¼” stiles on the front wall, evenly spaced, between the rails.
 Using molding which is no wider than the stiles are thick, line the inside edges of the recessed panels with the moulding to give it a more seamless look (or go without if you’d prefer a craftsman feel). These will need to be mitered and then nailed into place with 1 ¼” nails.

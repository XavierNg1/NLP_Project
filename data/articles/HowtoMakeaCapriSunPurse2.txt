 Drink or empty out 27 individual pouches.
 Place a dish towel on a table, lay a pouch on top of it, and flatten it like pizza dough with a rolling pin. You need to drink and flatten out approximately 27 pouches, so let's hope you're thirsty!

, With a sewing machine, sew four pouches with the bottom of the pouch to the top of another pouch. This will be the bottom of the purse.
 Repeat that step for the other side of the purse. The picture above used 3 by 3 pouches for the sides, but you can use as many or as few as you want, depending on how large you want your purse.


Sew each side to the middle pieces of the bottom.
 Bend the end pieces of the bottom up to meet the sides of the purse, and sew together. This creates a large box of Capri Sun.
 Sew the last three remaining pouches together, just like the sides of the purse. Attach this new piece to a long side of the box you have already created. This creates a closing flap to the purse.
 Use a ribbon or fabric to make a strap and put snaps on the flap to close the purse.

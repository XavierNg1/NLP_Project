 Stored Dell Xps M1330 batteries continue losing energy, albeit at a much slower pace. If the stored battery is totally discharged, it could be destroyed.;
, Fully charged batteries deteriorate faster than half-charged batteries. Most articles I’ve read recommended storing laptop batteries with a 40–60% charge.
 I usually put it in the fridge. It keeps my battery fresh and crisp. Check out this table at Wikipedia. 0°C (32°F) seems to be the best storage temperature. I wouldn’t put the battery in the freezer even though Li-ion batteries only freeze at approximately −40°C.
 A moist environment will accelerate discharging the battery.
 I would remove it from the fridge at least every 30 days to calibrate it (fully discharge and charge).
 If the temperature is raised too fast, it will strain the battery.
 But then I realized that there are quite a few things that can be done wrong with laptop batteries. That’s how I ended up with three articles. It is quite amazing that we can build space ships that have enough energy to fly to the moon but still have no decent portable energy sources for simple laptops. Perhaps fuel cells will change the picture in a few years.

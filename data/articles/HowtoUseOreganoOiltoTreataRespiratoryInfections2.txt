uses organic (herbicide and pesticide free) oregano oil
has been standardized to 75-85% carvacrol
uses Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), sets of rules and regulations set up by the FDAhas a “Seal of Approval” from the Natural Products Association (NPA) or the US Pharmacopeia (USP), Add 2-3 drops of oregano oil to one tablespoon of olive oil and take by mouth once per day. You can also add 2-3 drops of oregano oil to food each day to get your dose of oregano oil.


Do not exceed this amount. Oregano oil can be toxic and even lethal if taken in large doses., Oregano leaf tea may also offer some medicinal benefits and it has far fewer potential side effects than the oil. If you do not want to risk the side effects that can come along with taking oregano oil, then you may want to try making some oregano tea instead.To make oregano tea, pour one cup of boiling water over one teaspoon of dry or fresh oregano leaves. Steep the tea for about five minutes. Then, use a strainer to remove the leaves from the liquid. Drink 1-3 cups per day until you recover from your respiratory infection.

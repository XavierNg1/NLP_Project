 Choose something to wrap the tulle around, for example your finger or a pencil. Wrap around and around until you're happy with the amount and consider that it appears "rose-like".


Tight wrapping means a smaller rose, looser wrapping means a larger rose (as well as the amount of tulle used).
 Wind the tulle length a few times around the ball to complete and glue the end piece in place.


An application of hot glue in the center of the rose can help to keep the flower shape intact.
 Depending on what you're adding the tulle rose to, use the right affixing method to keep it snugly in place.

Trying to talk to someone who is worked up or angry could result in an unpleasant scene or a fight.If a parent on the sidelines is making mean-spirited remarks or openly criticizing the kids on the field, it’s natural to feel angry. Remind yourself that staying cool is the most mature and appropriate way to handle the situation.;
, Depending on the situation, it may be okay to ask another parent to calm down a little. If someone is blocking others’ view of the field or being too loud, but doesn’t seem aggressive or angry, try approaching them and politely asking them to take it down a notch.If someone is getting too worked up over the outcome of the match, put things into perspective by reminding them, “Hey, it’s just a game.”

, One badly-behaved team parent can ruin things for everybody else. Talk to other parents and see if they’re also bothered by the overzealous person’s antics.

 If a parent on the sidelines is swearing, picking fights with other parents or otherwise acting in a very inappropriate way, find an authority figure to deal with them. They are more likely to listen to an official or police officer than another parent., Sometimes the best way to deal with a bad team parent is to provide a good example yourself. Cheer on your child’s team, praise the players for doing their best, and emphasize having fun. Avoid making critical comments or arguing with coaches and referees.

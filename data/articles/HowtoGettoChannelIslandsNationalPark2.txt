After clicking the “View Schedule & Availability” button near the top of the home page, you’ll be taken to a page with a list of the Channel Islands. Choose the island you wish to visit, pick a day and time and select how many people are making the trip.
The next page will list return dates. Choose when you would like to make your way back to the mainland, and the site will calculate your balance. If you don’t have an account with the site, you will need to make one here before proceeding to the payment screen.
Space on each cruise is limited, and some islands are inaccessible on certain days or times. Additionally, trips made during peak times in the afternoon are subject to higher fees than those scheduled for earlier or later in the day.
 Among the things you’ll need to know:


Travelers must arrive one hour before departure time, and all gear must be on the boat no later than 30 minutes prior to departure.
No single item can exceed 45 pounds (20 kg). There are no exceptions to this rule.
All gear should be marked with name, phone number, and color-coded tag corresponding to your arrival island.
 Parking at the visitor center is limited, so carpooling is recommended if you are traveling in a larger group.

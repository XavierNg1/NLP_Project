 Sometimes the solution is simple. All you have to do is find a new place to store your router.


Raise as far as possible to increase the effective broadcast range.
Place near the center of your house or apartment for wider coverage.
Move closer to the receivers, if possible.
Move away from any metal including metal shelving, filing cabinets and similar common objects.
Move away from cordless phones and microwaves, which operate on the same 2.4-Ghz frequency.
 Move your unit as far away as possible from your next-door neighbor's WiFi router. In addition, if you're living in an apartment building, there might be multiple routers in operation too. Note: make sure you're using a different channel than everyone else.

 It would be senseless to travel all the way to New York City just to see a taping that you might not even be able to see. Plan a vacation!;
, Go to and check if they are taping on the day of your travel. They do not tape shows every week.
 Find the "NBC Studios" marquee at 7 a.m. the morning of the taping. Lines fill up fast, so don't be surprised if you show up at 5 am and there is already a line.
 This is your only shot.


If you're lucky, you might get to see one of your favorite shows in person!

, Include the names and ages of everybody traveling, and anything else. You may attend the 8 p.m. dress rehearsal or to 11:29 live taping. You cannot choose the dates of your taping unless you get stand-by tickets!

, And wait some more. Wait until you get that confirmation email. You'll be notified 4-6 weeks in advance before your taping. Remember-- this could be at any time!

, You can go from family extravaganza to a quick weekend getaway. If you're not to crazy about taking missing work or school, fly Friday night and fly back Sunday morning. You should have enough time to squeeze in something fun on Saturday.
 You need to be at 30 Rockefeller Plaza by 8 am to pick up your tickets, so show up or you're giving up your seat to some stranger.

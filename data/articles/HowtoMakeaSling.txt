 One of the simplest is called the Apache Throw. Face 60 degrees away from your target, your arm extended behind your back, with your weight on your back foot. Swing forward, bringing your arm forward like a line drive. As you do this, shift your weight to your front foot and swing the rest of your body forward. Your arm guides the throw, but it is your body that propels the stone to lethal velocity. To release the stone, simply let go of the release cord.

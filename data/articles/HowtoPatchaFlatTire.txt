 Use a small tire iron/lug wrench and a large screwdriver to work your way around the tire. You will need two tools at a minimum. Be careful not to pinch the inner tube with the tools as you work the tire free from the rim.;
, Inflate the inner tube and coat the tire with very soapy water or submerge the tire in tub tub or kitchen sink. Mark the spot where the air is coming out of the tire.
 For the patch to hold, the inner tube must be dry and free of dirt and oil. Thoroughly dry the inner tube, then clean the area around the leak with denatured alcohol. (Note that this is different than the rubbing alcohol you use as a disinfectant.)

, The repair kit likely has a metal device that looks like a Parmesan cheese grater. Lightly rub this over the area around the hole. Alternatively use a piece of 50-200 grit sandpaper to lightly roughen the area before applying the patch.
 Trim the patch so that it covers the hole and extends for about one inch beyond the hole in all directions. Rounded patches are best.
 Follow the directions on the patch kit. Put a moderate amount of glue on both the inner tube surface and the patch. Hold the patch firmly in place for a minute or two, then let dry for another 15-30 minutes. Again, follow the directions in the patch kit. Each glue and patch formulation is a bit different.
 Reinflate the inner tube and coat the patched area with soapy water. No soap bubbles should form. If they do, peel back the part of the patch that leaks and reglue.
 After you have determined that the inner tube is holding air and the leak has been repaired, deflate the inner tube and put it on the rim, then put the tire back on the rim.

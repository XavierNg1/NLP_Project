 Biofeedback is a medical technique that relies on measured feedback, via electrical sensors, from your body. The goal is to learn how to relax or contract your muscles to make changes in your body's performance.Be aware, however, that some studies suggest biofeedback may not be very effective, especially for the monetary and time constraints it requires.Common biofeedback methods involve measuring each of the following:


brainwave
respiration (breathing)
heart rate
muscle contraction
sweat glands
body temperature

, There are two primary biofeedback devices used for individuals suffering from migraines. The first is a portable device, which is usually worn around the waist. It tracks your respiration patterns and indicates when your body and mind are calm. The goal is to recognize when the symptoms of a migraine are approaching and to learn how to control your body's stress response., Interactive programs have a similar goal to portable devices: to measure physiological variations in your body and teach you how to reduce stress when a migraine is approaching. Common ways of managing stress that are combined with biofeedback include altering your respiration, relaxing your body's muscles, and avoiding certain thoughts.

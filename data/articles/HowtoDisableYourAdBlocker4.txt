 On Microsoft Edge, ad blockers come in the form of plugins that are manually added to your browser. You can turn off your ad blocker by accessing your extension.
 To do this, tap the three horizontal dots in the upper-right corner of the window.
 You'll see a list of all of the extensions you've installed on Edge.
 If you have a lot of extensions and know your ad blocker's name, you can find it by pressing ctrl+F and typing the name of the extension into the bar that appears.
 You'll see options to modify the extension.
 This will disable the extension while you browse.


To turn the blocker back on, navigate to this menu again and click "Turn on" at any time.

 You may make U-turns only if you are crossing a double yellow line, there is a “U-turn Only” sign, you are in a residential area, and if you are in the far left lane and no sign is prohibiting U-turns.You may also make a U-turn on a divided highway if there is an opening in the center divider and the opening is not reserved for law enforcement or emergency vehicles.
 Once you approach your turn, get as close to the centerline of the road as possible and come to a complete stop. Observe the traffic and check for oncoming vehicles and motorcycles, as well as pedestrians and bicycles.Oncoming vehicles must be more than 200 feet (60 meters) away before making a U-turn.
Do not make a U-turn from the right lane.
 Do this to prepare for the U-turn. Once the lanes are clear, slightly accelerate and let the steering wheel correct itself to a straight position. Then turn into the left lane.Do not turn into the far right lane.
 U-turns are prohibited when there is a “No U-turn” sign, you are on a one-way street, and when you cannot see 200 feet (60 meters) in either direction (because of hills, curves, rain, snow, fog, and other obstacles).Additionally, do not make U-turns on highways that are split by curbs, two sets of double yellow lines, and other dividing mechanisms.

 If you have a Blackberry phone you can find your SIM card under the battery, or sometimes below the battery slot. With your Blackberry powered off, remove the battery door, and then the battery before you attempt to switch out your SIM card.Most Blackberry phones have a SIM card slot that works sort of like a belt, allowing you to remove your card by pushing your card upwards from the bottom, while pulling it out at the top.
With the Blackberry, you may have to be slightly forceful with switching your SIM card, try applying pressure and sliding it out, or use your fingernails to pry it out.
To replace your SIM card, simply slide your new one back in the same way the old one was removed, then replace your battery.

Insert your SIM card with the metal contacts facing away from you into the slot closest to the camera.
To remove it, press down on the top of the card until it clicks, then pinch it and pull it out.

 Battle all the Pokémon trainers and wild Pokémon you see along the way. This will raise your Pokémon's HP, level, etc and will help you when you complete the Gym Leaders and the Elite Four. (and Champion);
, Buy lots of Revives, Max Elixirs and Hyper Potions before battling the Elite Four. Though buying the items that raise your attack, defence, etc will help you too.
 This will increase your chances of winning.
 Some moves work better in certain conditions, E.g Thunder will always hit when it's raining. So, if you send out Kyogre first, causing it to rain for the battle, and then send out a Pokémon that knows Thunder afterwards. You'll figure it out.
 And remember if you fail - you can always go off and train your Pokémon and return later. But to avoid this problem, save after every battle and as stated above, if you buy a lot of Revives and other healing materials you can then hopefully completely Revive all your Pokémon giving them full health giving you the highest chance of beating the next person, and plan strategically, so bring in a mixture of high level Pokémon of different types, and also use Pokémon with a high critical hit ratio and have effective moves against the opposing Elite 4 member or Champion.

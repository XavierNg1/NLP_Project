 Using any web browser, go to www.badoo.com/signin.
 You’ll find this under the “More options” title on the right side.


If this is your first time signing in using your Yandex account, a pop-up window will appear, and you will be prompted to sign into your Yandex user account. Log into Yandex using the fields provided, and then click the “Sign in” button on the pop-up window to connect your Yandex account to Badoo.
If you’ve already linked the two accounts, you will be redirected to your Badoo account home page.

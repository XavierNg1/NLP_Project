 When buying your toner, always check the toner's ingredients so that you can find a toner that fits your skin type. Depending on your skin type, check the label for ingredients that you want to avoid.
 No matter what kind of skin type you have, you generally want to avoid toners that have tough astringents like alcohol, menthol, and witch hazel. These ingredients will irritate your skin and deplete your skin’s natural oils.Also try to avoid toners with fragrance, such as rose water or citrus fruits. Fragrances can cause your skin to become irritated. These toners are usually labeled “fresheners” or “clarifiers” and are simply eau de cologne for your face., When investing in a toner, try not to go too cheap. Visit your local beauty supply store or a department store to buy a toner. Avoid buying toners at drugstores. These toners usually contain high amounts of alcohol and/or astringents in them, which will irritate your skin.

 Allow it to warm up for five minutes or so to ensure that it is appropriately hot. Do not use oil or cooking spray, since the nuts themselves contain enough oil to cook. It would be beneficial to use a non-stick skillet, however., The nuts should only be cooked on a single layer, and it is not recommended to toast a large batch that forms a multi-layer pile. It is generally a good idea to start with the "x" facing upward on as many of the nuts as possible, but it is not essential, since the walnuts will not stay in the same position for long., After the first minute or two, begin stirring the nuts. They can rest for 30 second intervals or so, but for the most part, the nuts should be stirred continuously to ensure even and thorough toasting. Use a heat-resistant spatula., The process may take a little longer or a little shorter depending on how hot the heating elements in your stovetop make the pan. Once the nuts begin browning and become very fragrant, they are ready to be pulled off. You should also dump them out of the pan since they will continue cooking there even after it has been removed from the heat.

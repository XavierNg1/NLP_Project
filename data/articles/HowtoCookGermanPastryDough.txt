 Place your flour into your sifter and gently shake it until you have 2 cups worth of sifted flour underneath your sifter. You can also sift your flour without a sifter. Once you finish sifting, place your flour into a bowl.;
, Create a mound out of your sifted flour and create an indentation in the middle of your well. The flour should look similar to a miniature volcano. Your indentation should be large enough to fit in your other ingredients (but don't add them yet).
 Place the salt and the egg inside of the well in your flour. Then, soften the butter and slice it into small pieces. Place these small pieces on the rim of your well.
 It's preferable to use hands to mix the ingredients. However, using a fork or whisk works as well. Work on mixing from the outside in, and slowly incorporate the wet ingredients (the egg and butter). Mix the ingredients until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.
 Add the water once the mixture starts clumping together. Add bits of water while mixing the ingredients. Continue mixing the dough and adding water until the dough has a smooth consistency and the ingredients are no longer clumping together.
 Roll all of the dough into one smooth ball. Make sure to mix up any clumps of unevenly mixed ingredients.
 Wrap the ball of dough in plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Then, store it in the fridge (at 35°F or 1.2°C) for 1-2 hours. Then, the dough is ready to cook with.

 Never store a wet sleeping bag.
 There are two main schools of thought on long-term sleeping bag storage. Both probably depend on the amount of space you have but the choice is yours:



Store your sleeping bag hanging up. If you have the space, hanging your sleeping bag is an ideal way to ensure that the feathers or fill are not being crushed at all. The best hanger is one that the bag can be folded over rather than a clip one, although both will do the job.

An alternative to hanging is to store it lying flat under a bed. Either way, the point is to let it loft out and breathe, without being exposed to weather or dirt.

Keep your sleeping bag in the larger cotton bag for storage. For those with less space, the key thing is to get your sleeping bag out of its travel stuff/compression sack, the tightness of which breaks, damages or weakens the lofting abilities of the feathers or fill. If you have an older sleeping bag, or it just didn't come with a larger storage bag, purchase one. Most camping and outdoors stores carry these. Or just use a large pillowcase.

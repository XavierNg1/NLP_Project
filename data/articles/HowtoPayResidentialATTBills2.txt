 Either log into your MyAT&T account and print out the bill you want to pay or use the statement you received in the mail. The statement will include the amount you owe, details about the bill, and the payment due date.


If you are unable to print your bill, note the account number on your check, and include a note with your name, address, and phone number associated with the account.
 You can pay your bill by either personal check or money order. Because of security concerns and lack of a receipt, do not mail cash.
 You can either use the envelope provided with your monthly bill or hand address an envelope. Put your return address in the upper left corner and add the AT&T payment mailing address. Affix proper first class postage and your payment is ready to mail.


You can verify the payment address on the AT&T website under the "Support" tab. The current address is: AT&T U-verse, P.O. Box 5014, Carol Stream, IL, 60197.

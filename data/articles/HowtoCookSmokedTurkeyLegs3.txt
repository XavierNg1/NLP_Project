 Prepare your charcoal or wood stove as directed, but add several large hunks of hardwood among the charcoal. This will release smoke during grilling and impart a smoky flavor to the turkey legs.
 You could also create a small seasoning packet to place directly in the center of the grill, surrounded by the coals or wood. Take an aluminum pie plate and fill it with the following ingredients. Then, cover the plate with foil and poke holes around the top. When this starts to smoke, add your turkey legs.


1/2 cup white rice
1/3 cup black loose leaf tea
1/4 cup brown sugar
6 whole cloves
3 star anise pods

, Smoke the turkey legs for 2 to 2.5 hours.


If you want smokier turkey legs, consider grilling them longer at a lower heat. Try 3.5 to 4 hours at 225 to 240 degrees.
 Use a meat thermometer and check to see if the legs have reached 165 °F (73.9 °C). If so, they're finished. If not, continue checking the temperature at regular intervals until they're at 165 degrees F.
 Serve the turkey legs immediately or wrap them in foil and refrigerate them if you're going to eat them much later.


To reheat the turkey legs, set the foil-wrapped cooked turkey legs in a 275 degree F. oven for 30 minutes.

 Recognize the fact that the aggressive behavior isn’t really directed at you. This kind of outburst is an instinctual, involuntary reaction that your cat is having to other external factors. Sometimes, if the cat can’t get to the thing causing the aggressive feelings, it will lash out at the next thing it encounters.This doesn’t indicate that your cat is mean, doesn’t like you, or that you have a bad relationship with your cat.
 If you know what to look for, the signs of aggression can be pretty obvious in cats. They typically either make themselves larger in an overtly aggressive manner, or they try to make themselves appear smaller in a defensively aggressive situation. Some standard signs of aggressive behavior in cats include:Growling, howling, hissing, or spitting.
Stiff tail lowered to the ground.
Crouching.
Flattened ears.
Turning sideways instead of facing the opponent straight on.
 There are quite a few situations that commonly cause cats to redirect their anger. In these situations, the cat is unable to reach or interact with the object of its aggression, so it transfers these feelings and instincts to something in its environment. Some examples of situations that can cause redirected anger in cats include:Seeing another cat outside through the window.
Smelling a strange cat’s odor on a family member.
Watching birds or other prey animals.
Being in an animal shelter or veterinarian’s office.
Hearing high-pitched noises.

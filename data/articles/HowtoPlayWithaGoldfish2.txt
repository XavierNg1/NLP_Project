 It is possible to train a goldfish to do tricks. You have to work with them consistently like you do with dogs. One way to train a goldfish is to purchase a training kit. They usually come with toys, a manual, and a feeding stick to deliver rewards quickly.Watch the DVD and read the manual that comes with your training kit. This will help you learn how to train the goldfish.
Some kits come with a hoop, basketball court, tunnel, soccer goal, limbo bar, and so on., If you aren’t going to purchase a training video, you may be able to train a goldfish on your own. Start by building exercises into your daily routine with the goldfish. Select a few minutes that you are able to repeat everyday. Do training at the same time of day.Keep in mind that the goldfish needs to be at least two inches long. This is because fish of this length or longer respond better to training., Don’t expect your goldfish to be able to do all the tricks you have in mind right away. Start by training them in one trick at a time. After they become very good at one trick, add another one.Eventually you may be able to add more than one trick into one training session.
 If you don’t have a goldfish training kit, think of your own games. For example, place a rubber band in the bottom of the water so that it stands on its side like a hoop. Drag food through the hoop with your fingers to entice the goldfish to swim through it. Give it the food every time it swims through.


Also consider placing a small, thoroughly washed ball into the water and encouraging the goldfish to push it around.

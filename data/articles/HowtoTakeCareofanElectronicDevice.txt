 Most devices can break in many ways. Getting a case is a good first step toward taking good care of your electronic device. You can find a wide variety of cases on different websites. I really recommend amazon.com for your case shopping. It is a great site; has everything you need for electronics, including cases. Don't rush, do some research, or you might end up getting a case of the wrong phone brand, or with bad quality. And shipping it back isn't easy.;
, One of the most important things in protecting your device is keeping it away from unpleasant threats. Keep it away from pets, (cat urine never washes off), little siblings, and water/food. If you happen to spill water on it, there is a fast remedy to save your digital friend. If you are close to the kitchen when you spill something on your device, immediately get a bag of uncooked rice, (white rice works better) and submerge your device in it. The rice will extract the water, hopefully before the water can do any damage. After about ten minutes, take it out and try using it. The only problem is how to dunk a laptop in a tiny bag of rice.Â 

, If an expensive device is in the hands of a young or old user, you might want to consider getting a protection plan. The plan is about 20 or 30 dollars, so if you break it, the company will ship you a new one or fix the fixable parts for free.
 Cleaning sets are usually cheap; around 10 bucks. The kit usually includes a cleaning rag (made of special materials) and a bottle of chemicals to spray on your screen. DO NOT USE REGULAR WATER AND A PAPER TOWEL! Also, if you're screen constantly gets smudged, you might want to think about buying a screen protector. These are very handy, and cost about as much as the cleaning kit. It might change the feel of your screen, (especially in iPhones and iPods) but it protects your screen from dirt, bugs and smudges. If you follow these steps, you will have an electronic device in great condition, just like you got it out of the box.

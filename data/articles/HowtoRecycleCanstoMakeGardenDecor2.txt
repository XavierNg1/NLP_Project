 These can be food cans with their lids removed. The size of the can is up to you. Just remember to wear sturdy work gloves, as these cans have a tendency to be very sharp.
 Use aviation snips to make vertical slits down the side of the can. Start at the open rim and cut the can down to the base. Repeat this process all the way around the can.


Make sure to leave 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) between each cut.
 Using the aviation snips, trip the ends of each of the metal strips so that they are round and petal-like. Again, use caution, as these cans are very sharp. Bend the petals out so that the can looks like a flower.


Consider painting the ‘flowers’. If you do not know how to paint metal cans, refer to Method 4.
 To give the flower a stem, you can attach it to a garden cane. Punch two holes in the center of the flower and run a bit of wire through the holes.


Loop the wire around the garden cane and secure it to the back of the cane.

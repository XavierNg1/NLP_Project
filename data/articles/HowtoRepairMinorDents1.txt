 Using a plunger to remove a dent works best on large, shallow dents in flat components of the body like the door or hood. Whether you use a toilet plunger or an automotive one designed for dent pulling, no plunger can remove creases from steel, they can only pop dents back out.If the dent is smaller than a quarter, a plunger likely will not resolve it.
The flatter the body panel, the better the plunger method will work.;
, You can actually use a toilet plunger with a similar level of effectiveness for this method as you can a dent removing plunger purchased from an auto parts store. Plungers designed for dent removal may have a higher success rate with more difficult dents.Use a clean plunger to avoid getting any kind of debris on the paint of your vehicle.
Automotive plungers are often quite a bit more expensive than toilet plungers.
 Use a bit of water and a rag to moisten the suction surface of the plunger. This will allow it to create a seal against the vehicle, which will enable you to pull up on the plunger to suck the metal back into shape.Make sure to use clean, plain water to avoid damaging the paint.
 If the dent is larger than the circumference of the plunger, start on the edges of the dent. If it is smaller than the plunger, place the plunger directly over the dent. Press the plunger into the vehicle.You may need to repeat the process from multiple angles on larger dents.
When placing the plunger along the side of the dent, ensure the plunger is over both the dented and undented area.
 Pull backward on the plunger in short, jerking motions just as you might when plunging a toilet. The plunger may pop off before the dent is removed, so prepare yourself to re-moisten the plunger and start again.It may take multiple tries to suck a dent back out of the metal.
Short, quick motions will yield the best results when sucking dents out of steel.

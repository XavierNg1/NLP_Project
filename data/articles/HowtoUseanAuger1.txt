 You need to consider what kind of soil you'll be digging in, how many holes you will dig and whether you have someone to help you run the auger.


A hand auger can be operated by 1 or 2 people. This is best if you only have 1 or 2 holes to dig, because it takes a lot of work to turn the handle.
A power auger uses a gasoline engine to turn the auger, but it can be dangerous if it runs into a rock or other obstruction. The auger will stop suddenly, which can cause the top to jerk, knocking you off your feet or even breaking your arm.
A wheeled auger is a power auger mounted on a wheeled frame, so there is less chance you'll be injured if it stops.
A tractor auger is safest because you operate it from the tractor seat. If something goes wrong, you are at safe distance.;
, If you use a power auger, you also need hearing and eye protection. Don't wear loose clothing that can be caught in the auger.
 Your auger will work best if the first few inches or centimeters is easy to dig into. Use a spade, digging tool or clamshell post-hole digger. If the ground is still too hard, soak the area with water.
 Begin turning the handle or start the motor.


If a powered auger stops suddenly, immediately release the throttle or hit the kill switch stop the motor.
 Raise the auger out of the hole and dump the dirt off the blades. If you don't regularly dump off the dirt, the auger will become too heavy to raise easily. It may even get stuck in the hole.
 Most post-holes are about 3 feet (1 meter) deep. Augers can dig much deeper, however, if you use extension rods.

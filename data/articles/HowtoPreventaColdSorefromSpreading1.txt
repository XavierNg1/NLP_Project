 The herpes virus can spread to your fingers and cause a type of infection known as herpes whitlow. To prevent this, do not touch the cold sore with a bare finger, suck on your finger while you have a cold sore, or otherwise put your fingers into contact with the cold sore.Even if your cold sore is painful, resist the temptation to pick at it. Instead, take an over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, or use a topical pain-relieving cream containing lidocaine or benzocaine.;
, Even if you take care not to touch your cold sore, you might touch it without realizing that you did. Washing your hands frequently will help keep the virus from spreading to other areas., Since the herpes virus is most contagious when cold sores appear, if you can make them go away, then you reduce the chances of spreading the virus elsewhere on your body.


Ask your doctor about what antiviral drugs (such as Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, Famciclovir, and Penciclovir) you can take to make the cold sores disappear sooner.
Some antivirals are in pill form, while others are creams. For severe cases there are also injections.
You can also take an over-the-counter cream (containing Docosanol) to shorten your cold sore outbreak.If you use an antiviral cream, apply it to the cold sore while wearing a disposable glove and/or use a cotton swab. This will keep you from touching the cold sore and potentially spreading the virus.

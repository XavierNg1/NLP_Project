 If you live in a very rainy climate, additional watering may not be necessary. It is important that your strawberries receive 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water per week, though. If you live in dryer climates, you should water the plants every three to five days. Water in the early morning, before the heat of the afternoon, and apply the water directly to the soil at the root zone.
 Frequent weeding is necessary to make sure that your strawberries do not need to compete for nutrients, but chemical weed-killers should not be used in an organic garden. Weeding by hand or with the use of garden tools is your best organic option.
 During the spring and summer, mulch should be added between berry plants to keep the soil moist and to control weeds. Mulch should be spread over the entire bed during the winter to maintain moisture and protect the plants from heavy frosts.


Use a mulch with few weed seeds. Reed canary is a good choice, but clean barley straw also works well.
 Fertilizing in the early spring leads to sweet, soft berries. A blend of seaweed and fish emulsion makes a good choice since it is both organic and well-balanced.
 Strawberries can fall victim to a number of insects. If you spot a tarnished plant but, sap beetle, white grub, or aphid on your plant, treat it immediately with an organic pesticide like food grade Diatomaceous Earth, neem oil, cayenne pepper spray, or an organic soap spray., Ripe strawberries will be plump and bright red, and usually appear 30 days after flowering. Test one berry first before harvesting more, and harvest ripe berries every two to three days. Cut the berries off with clean shears, leaving a short stem behind.

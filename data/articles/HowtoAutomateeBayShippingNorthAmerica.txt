 A great way to make wrapping and packaging easier and more effective is to set up a professional packaging station in your home. You'll find that having all your tape, boxes, cutters and other tools in one organized, well-lit work space can work wonders. Stick with this home wrapping station until you reach 5-10 sales a day. At this point you can hire someone to do your shipping for you.;
, Both UPS and the United States Postal Service offer quick and easy label printing. This allows you to print shipping labels directly from their website. Obviously, a lot easier than manually typing in customers addresses into a document then printing it.
 Delivery to the shipper is quite easy to time manage. Instead of sending out orders every day of the week, try shipping only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. This will provide your customers with speedy shipping and greatly reduce the number of trips you need to take back and forth from your shipper. As time goes on, you can have an employee take over this task as well. Also, with shipping, USPS has a service where they will actually pick up your flat rate boxes that need to be shipped. You can look into this as well.

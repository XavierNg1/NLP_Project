 First, ask them to talk about their cultural or financial fears, and allow them to explain what it is about your news that makes them fearful. Then, let them know why you are not afraid by being clear about your motives and plans.


You could say, for example, “Do you feel that because she is from a different culture that any children we might eventually have would not understand or appreciate our culture?”

, Avoid giving ultimatums like “It's my way or nothing,” or “If you really loved me, you'd support me.” You probably would not change after a single conversation, so don't expect your parents to do that, either. Taking a side will only confirm their worst fear: that you are rejecting them, their love, their values, and your place in the family as their child.
 Instead of taking a side, focus on the love you have for your parents. Don't be defensive.If you act defensive, it will suggest to them that something is wrong with her or something is not right in your relationship. Instead, clarify your own opinions and use “I” statements.


Saying things like, “She thinks you don't like her,” will only make your parents dislike her more. Own your own opinions rather than using your girl as the scapegoat. A better comment would be something like, “I think you would really like her just as much as I do, once you get to know her.”

 Group therapies and busy treatment centers may be challenging for you if you struggle with anxiety, fear of crowds, or if you have limited interpersonal skills.


In such cases, it may be better to work individually with a therapist (even on the Internet or phone if necessary) before transitioning to group options.
 Acupuncture, hydrotherapy, and other alternative mental health therapies are unlikely to be as effective if you carry significant skepticism or doubt about them.


If you prefer more Western treatments, opt for them over alternative therapies.
 If you suffer from other health problems or if your mental health condition is highly variable, individual therapies may be most beneficial.


Consult a health professional before beginning exercise regimens, using herbal therapies, trying hydrotherapy, or selecting other mental health therapeutic methods to make sure you are healthy enough to participate.






If your condition causes violent outbursts, unpredictable behavior, or lapses in awareness of behavior, you may need intensive individualized therapy supervised by a mental health professional or institutional staff.

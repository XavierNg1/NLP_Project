 Lining a Bundt pan with paper is not worth the effort. Grease and flour cover the crevices more effectively than paper, and are usually enough to prevent sticking. In fact, you can use this method for regular tins as well, as long as the cake batter isn't too runny.
 Most cakes do well in a fully greased tin. but there are exceptions:If there’s a buttery crust (such as graham cracker crust) touching the tin, there’s already enough fat to prevent sticking.
A light batter such as angel food or chiffon cake will rise higher (and end up fluffier) if it has an ungreased side to climb up. The flour will help with this, but you may still want to leave the upper sides ungreased.
 Soften your butter in the microwave for a few seconds if you took it straight from the fridge. Wipe the stick of butter directly onto base of the tin, or apply it with a pastry brush. Use the advice above to decide how much of the interior sides to grease.


Bundt cakes often stick where the tubes of the Bundt pan meet the base.Pay special attention to crevices and corners like these.
You can use shortening instead.
You can use a non-stick cooking spray, but cheap grocery store brands tend to be less effective. Look for a higher-quality spray or "cake release spray" at specialty cooking and baking stores., Sprinkle flour over the base of the tin. Hold one end of the pan and tap the other end repeatedly. This will shunt excess flour over the base, covering the whole area.Rotate the tin and repeat to cover the sides.


Substitute cocoa powder for dark-colored cakes. This isn't necessary if you plan to frost the cake.
 Angle the tin downward and tap out extra flour. If there are any gaps on the surface, cover them with more grease and flour.

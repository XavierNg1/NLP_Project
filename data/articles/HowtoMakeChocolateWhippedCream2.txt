 Chop 4 ounces dark chocolate into small pieces and put them into a large, stainless steel bowl.
 Bring 1 cup heavy cream and 1 tablespoon sugar to a boil over medium heat.
 Immediately pour this mixture over the chopped chocolate.









Tap the bowl on the counter to settle the chocolate into the cream.
Let it sit for a minute, then stir slowly with a spatula until the chocolate melts.
Do not beat the mixture: you want to avoid adding air to the mixture.
Blend for about 2 minutes.

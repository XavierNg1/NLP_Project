 To avoid stress at suppertime, stick to kid-friendly foods that you know your children will enjoy. Choose plain meals that don’t have too many ingredients or seasonings. Try basic ideas such as:


Chicken nuggets
Macaroni and cheese

Spaghetti and meatballs

Mini pizzas;
, Presentation is a good way to get your kids interested in the meal you are serving. Try different cutting techniques, plating methods, or color schemes to get kids interested in food. For instance, try stacking the different parts of your child’s dinner instead of serving it side by side on a plate (e.g. serve a row fish sticks with French fries stacked across them perpendicularly, then top them with green beans). Other ideas might include:Using cookie cutters to make food into shapes
Making miniature foods (e.g. mini pizzas, single-serve shepherd pies)
Using a mandoline to cut vegetables into waffle cut or matchstick pieces

, Make suppertime fun and interactive for your kids by making a do-it-yourself meal. Cook the basic ingredients and have your kids customize and assemble their own plate. For instance, create a pasta bar by making cooked pasta, sauces, and toppings and letting your children choose their own meal combination.This concept could also work with a DIY taco station, or by having kids customize pizza that you then cook for them.

 Dreams can sometimes be very close to real life. Therefore, it can be difficult to realize you are dreaming. Develop ways to recognize a dream from reality.


Time is one way to differentiate a dream from reality. Time is notoriously inconsistent in dreams. For example, a clock may say it's 8 AM and then moments later claim it's 2 PM. If you're unsure whether or not you're dreaming, try looking at a clock.Reading in dreams is often difficult. Many people cannot read in dreams. People who can read in dreams often report the text is gibberish, word salad, or hieroglyphics. Trying to read a book or magazine can help you recognize that you are dreaming., As many people want to influence dreams as a way to come to terms with a problem, it's important that you remember your dreams. Do not jump out of bed, as removing yourself from REM sleep can cause you to forget your dreams. Try to stay in bed for a while and remember your dreams. Start out by trying to recall the emotions that accompanied your dreams. This can help trigger your remembering other details., A dream journal is another way to help remember your dreams. Record your dreams in as much detail as possible after you get out of bed. Having a dream journal can help you revisit your dreams later to interpret their possible meaning.

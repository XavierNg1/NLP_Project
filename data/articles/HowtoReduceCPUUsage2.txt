 On Windows, the Windows Task Manager software program will list everything using the CPU.


Right-click the taskbar, and then click Start Task Manager.
 In the Windows Task Manager, click the Applications tab. In the Applications list, in the header row, click CPU to sort the applications by CPU usage.


The CPU column number is the percentage of the CPU that an application is using.
The amount of the CPU that a program is using at any given time changes depending on what you’re trying to do. For example, a 3D modeling program will use far more of a computer’s CPU resources when it’s rendering a 3D animation, than when it’s sitting idle.
The programs using a large amount of the CPU when idle are the ones that you’ll want to close when you’re not using them. You can close an application in the Windows Task Manager by clicking the End Process button, but it’s usually better to exit the application from within the application.
If a program is stuck or hanging, the Windows Task Manager is a good way to force a program to quit.
 Click the Processes tab. This shows all of the processes running on your computer and their CPU usage. In the header, click CPU to sort the processes by their CPU usage.It’s not always obvious from the process name in the Image Name column what a process is. The Description column can provide additional information.
If you don’t know what a process is doing, even though it might be using a lot of the CPU, it’s best not to end the process, because it may be an important system process. You can use a search engine, such as Google, to learn more about specific processes.
 If you’re sure you want to end a CPU process, click a process row to select it, and then click the End Process button.


Click directly on any process displayed within the Task Manager window to highlight that specific process.
When you end a process using a lot of the CPU, that will free up resources for other applications and processes.

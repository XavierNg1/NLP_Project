 The control panel is the interface with all the buttons on it. Unscrew the screws holding it into place, or, on some models, unscrew the back panel behind it to access controls. Set the control panel someplace where it will be safe.As with most dryer repairs you should unplug your dryer before beginning this.
Skip this method if you have an electronic interface. Start switch malfunctions generally occur when the start button is an older, mechanical model., The start switch is the button that you press to start the dryer. There should be wires on the back of it that are connected to the start switch with metal parts. Use pliers to pull on the metal connectors, rather than the wires themselves, to disconnect the wires from the start switch.Take note of which wires insert into which parts of the start switch. You will need to correctly reconnect these wires to the appropriate spots.
 Insert the ohmmeter into the start switch and measure at a resistance of R X 1. The ohmmeter should record a reading of infinity. Now press down and hold on the start switch. The ohmmeter should now record a connectivity of zero.If the ohmmeter correctly records that the start switch has connectivity, then you should stop here. If it does not give correct readings, you should replace it.
 You should pull the knob out from the front. Then remove the hardware of the start switch from the back. On the back, there might be a locking tab connecting the start switch to the panel. Press down on it with a screw driver and pull out to release the start switch., Place the new start switch where the old one was. Connect the wires correctly to the places where they had previously been connected on the old model. After the switch is inserted, you put the control panel back on and plug the dryer in.

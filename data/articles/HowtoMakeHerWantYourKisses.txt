 So hug her as often as you can, put your arms around her and generally be protective! Girls get used to you and they are more comfortable.;
,, You should be spontaneous. Girls love unexpected kisses, so if she is alone surprise her with a kiss. That is a playful kiss and by 80% you will have your reward, namely more kisses.
 Kiss her and back away, she will look at you confused, then lean towards her give her another kiss, smile wily to her, back away and do something else. That will irritate her and she will come to kiss you. Kiss her but in a way that shows that you don't like that too much. She will probably kiss you more fiercely again, then give in and you will continue with a long make out session. At the end explain to her that you were just teasing her.

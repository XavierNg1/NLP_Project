 Measure out the amount of quinoa that you want to use, then transfer it to a large bowl that can accommodate the seeds along with water.
 Fill the bowl with enough cold water to cover the seeds. As the seeds sit, you should see the water begin to turn cloudy or murky., Use a whisk or a wooden spoon to mix the quinoa around in the bowl. This agitation should remove the bitter coating on the quinoa seeds. Work the whisk in a circular motion so that you mix both the water and the quinoa., Slowly tip your bowl while keeping your hands over the seeds to drain it. If you have a fine mesh sieve, you can use it to strain the quinoa seeds., You may have to repeat the process several times before the quinoa is fully rinsed. You'll know that it's rinsed when the water in the bowl is no longer murky.

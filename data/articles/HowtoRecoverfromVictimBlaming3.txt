 One way to stop feeling like a victim is to talk about your experience. Breaking your silence can help let go of your guilt and blame. It can also help with the healing process and help you to let go of the guilt and shame that often accompany abuse.This helps you move past any stigmas, any fear of judgment, and feelings that you are wrong.Tell your story to someone you trust. If you feel like it, tell your story to multiple people you trust.
As you tell the story, place the blame on the correct person and not you. This may be the abuser, the rapist, or the criminal.
 Part of taking your life back includes doing things that you enjoy and bring you happiness. This may be picking up old hobbies that you loved doing or trying new things. Find ways to make yourself happy and feel worthwhile.Make a list of things that you enjoy doing. This can give you something concrete to follow if you can’t come with any ideas.
Add new things you’d like to try onto the list. Trying new things can help you move forward as you recover.
For example, you may take up gardening, take a class, join a gym, learn to play an instrument, volunteer, or start cooking again.
 When you suffer from victim blaming, you may feel powerless and hopeless. To try to regain some confidence and a sense of power, try volunteering and working to help others in some way. You can do something small or large to help others.Try volunteering for a local organization or an animal shelter. You may want to plant trees or help with a food drive or food bank. You can also help in small ways, like giving blood or donating money to a charity.

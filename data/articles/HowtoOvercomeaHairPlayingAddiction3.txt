 Making changes like this, even if temporary, could immediately help break the habit of hair playing and help in the long term as well. Essentially, this will block your hands from reaching the area on your head where you repeatedly play with your hair. There are many alternatives when it comes to hats. You may find that some styles fit you better than others. A knit cap may fit you better than a cowboy or baseball cap. Choose the ones that make you feel comfortable.
 If you pin your hair down, then you won’t be able to play with it. Place these accessories strategically to gather your hair, and pull or push it away from the area of concern. Get creative and you might just start the next new fashion trend in hair accessories.
 Completely covering your head will eliminate any chance of playing with your hair. Each time you touch the scarf or bandana, you will be reminded that you are trying to make a positive change. If you can withstand the urge to pull off the scarf or bandana, you will experience a significant amount of “play-free” time.

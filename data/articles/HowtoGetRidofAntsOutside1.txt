 Baits are the most effective way to kill ants because they take the poison back to their nests., You need both sugary baits and protein/grease baits to draw out different types of ants., Baits draw ants in, so they won't be effective if you place them in an area with a chemical that repels them., You can use stakes or plastic bait containers. Some are one-time use, while others can be refilled. Refillable ones can be useful if you have a continual problem., Choose places near anthills and trails. Keep them away from areas where pets or kids will be, as they are poisonous.Space them about 10 to 20 feet (3 to 6Â m) away from each other., These types of baits take awhile to work, as the ants must carry them throughout their nests., As they get low, add more insecticide to keep the ants well-fed with pesticide.

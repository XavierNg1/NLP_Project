 There are two possible ways:









Peel them under cold running water. This method works if you don't want to plunge them in cold water.
Try to crack the shells when they're cooling in water. This makes them easier to peel cleanly. When the eggs are done cooking, pour off the hot water and replace with cold. Pick up each egg (be careful, they'll still be hot), and drop it back into the pot of cold water so the shell cracks. As they cool, water pulls into the shells. It will be easier for the shell removal without the egg itself. This is especially useful for dishes where appearance is important, such as with deviled eggs.
 If you're not using water, another method for peeling the egg is to roll it on a hard surface.This will crack the shell and loosen the membrane. Only do this with eggs cool enough to handle, or use silicon mitts.
 If you intend on slicing boiled eggs, do as follows:








Rinse a knife in hot water.
Wipe the knife dry every few cuts to remove sticking yolk from the knife.
Repeat as much as needed.
If you need to chop hard boiled eggs for a salad, mash them using a potato masher.,

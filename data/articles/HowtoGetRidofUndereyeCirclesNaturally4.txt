 A lack of sleep is one of the major causes of dark circles under the eyes. Try to get at least eight hours of quality sleep a night so you are well-rested and your eyes do not appear puffy or ringed with dark circles.You may set up a sleep schedule where you have the same bedtime and wake time every day, even on weekends, so your body gets a full eight hours of sleep.
You may also create a cool, dark environment in your bedroom so you can fall asleep more easily at night.
 Eating foods high in salt and sugar can increase inflammation in your body, including your skin. Try to avoid foods that contain lots of salt or processed sugars. Instead, go for foods that are rich in antioxidants, such as berries, beans, Brussels sprouts, and dark leafy greens., Your dark circles may get darker if you expose your skin to direct sunlight, as sun weakens the collagen in your blood vessels. Weakened collagen means your blood vessels are more prone to rupturing. This can then release blood into the tissues and lead to darker circles under your eyes. Prevent this by wearing sunglasses every time you step outside., If you think the dark circles under your eyes are due to allergies, you should go see an allergist and get tested for certain allergies. Your doctor may prescribe medication, a gentle massage around your eyes, face and neck, or a saline solution to treat your allergies. Treating your allergies could lead to lighted circles under your eyes.

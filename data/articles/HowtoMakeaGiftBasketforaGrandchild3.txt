 While older children can be tough to please, impress upon them that you loved them dearly from the day they were born, and you love them even more today. 

, Find out what music they are into, a store they favor, or get them a book they have been wanting.


Ask them if they want to talk about anything––(right?)––well, maybe someday it will come out. In the basket, include some of the things suggested above.
 They can look at maps, discuss what they want to do, and whether they can get a hotel with a pool. The destination could be an hour a way, but you are giving your time to them. If the trip is a longer car ride, consider offering gifts during the drive, to keep them amused for longer. In other words, rotate the surprises and everyone will keep it together, with less crankiness.
 Pack some really great treats in this basket. Oranges and small snack treats are nice, but this bonding may call for some serious treats, such as chocolates, cookies, cake and candies. You could even make the treats together the night before including the ingredients in the basket, with the recipes included for them to try again some day. 


Let their parents know your plans for the trip, but hey, you're their parents, so tell your grandchild's mom or dad to chill it with the kids! Let your grandchild think you're the coolest.

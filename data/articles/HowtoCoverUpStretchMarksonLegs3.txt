 Red stretch marks are fresh, and they can be minimized or reduced with certain products. White stretch marks are older and most creams will not change their appearance. However, good moisturizing routines will help your skin heal over time, and even white stretch marks should look less obvious.
 Work your inner and outer thighs using walking, pilates, yoga, barre, running, lunges and squats. Seek the help of a personal trainer to develop a leg routine that will firm the muscles underneath your stretch marks. If you have gained weight, aerobic exercise may help you shed a few pounds and take the pressure off your skin.


Although firm muscles will not get rid of stretch marks, they can reduce the appearance of cellulite, which often appears in the same areas that stretch marks appear.
Minimal weight loss may cause some fresh stretch marks to heal and nearly disappear. Significant weight loss may lead to excess skin on some areas of the legs.
 Visit your dermatologist and ask about Retin-A cream. This is used to treat red stretch marks. The active ingredient is vitamin A, which has been proven effective in reducing scarring.Your dermatologist may also prescribe topical steroids to be used with Retin-A.
 Healthy, moisturized skin shows blemishes less obviously than dry, irritated skin. This will also make other creams and makeups less harsh on your legs. Apply a moisturizer, such as cocoa butter, daily. If you have faint stretch marks, this might even make them virtually invisible by itself.

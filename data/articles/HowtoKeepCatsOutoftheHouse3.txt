 When you're entering your home, survey the area to look for cats. Check under bushes and other items near your door. Cats are good at hiding, so make sure to check all the small crevices.
 If you have a spray bottle handy, you can scare them off by spraying it at them. If you don't, you can try walking towards them and clapping your hands. Often cats will run off.
 If you give attention to affectionate strays, they'll likely hang around. Therefore, try not to pet your neighborhood strays, no matter how tempting it is., Similarly, if you feed cats, they will hang around. If you really want to feed strays, do it in an area away from your entrance, and create a barrier with scent around your door. That way, the cats will stay in their area and not in your home.

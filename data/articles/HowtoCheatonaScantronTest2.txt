 Some cheaters think the black lines that line the test are used to communicate data to the testing scanner, and since you're instructed to avoid making marks in the area, it's possible that coloring in the black spaces can cause the test to fail.


Supposedly, this is thought by some to be the most reliable method, yielding a successful machine fail up to 30% of the time.
Again, marking anywhere other than the answer bubbles is against the rules of the Scantron test, so you need to use light marks and not make them obvious.
 For the same reason that marking in the black area can cause the machine to fail, some think that erasing the lines can cause the same effect. On answers you don't know, make your best guess and then try erasing the black marks to the left of the row.


Of course, the problem with erasing these marks is that they'll probably fail the eye test. These rows will stick out like a sore thumb at a quick glance, possibly causing your test to be chucked. If you do this, only do it on some of the answers.
 On many pages of the Scantron test is a big page you're not supposed to mark. Supposedly, finding a way to cut it out on the sly yields a high success rate of making the machine fail. The problem is that it's super-obvious, both in the testing center and at a quick glance. Still, if you want to roll the dice, you can give it a shot.
 Though somewhat uncommon, some Scantron forms have a space where you can mark that the form you're filling out is either a test or the answer key. If your teacher made an epic mistake of using one of these forms, exploit it and mark yours as the key. It'll reset the machine and your answers will be correct. Your classmates won't be so lucky.

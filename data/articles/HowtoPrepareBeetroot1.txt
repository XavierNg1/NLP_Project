 Choose small to medium sized beets for a better flavor. Next, examine the beet roots for freshness. The leaves should be perky and green and the skin should be smooth and unbroken.If you’re going to cook the beets, choose beets that are similar in size. Otherwise, they will cook at different rates.
If the beetroot skin is wrinkled, the beetroot is too old.;

Store the leaves in the refrigerator for up to two days.

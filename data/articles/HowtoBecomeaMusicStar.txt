 First you have to stay cool. The first thing talent scouts notice is how you act when you're performing. To get a talent scout to notice you, you should be ready to perform anywhere, - the park, car wash, even a pool party. And you should perform as much as possible whenever you can or there is an opportunity.;
, Next you need a band. Get all of your most talented friends together and earn money for your equipment. Get everything needed to create the effects of a star: microphone, drums, amps (just about three), three guitars - acoustic, electric, and bass as well as whatever else you might need.
 It could be hip hop, rap, pop, country, rock, heavy metal, spiritual - or you could be a generalist and do a bit of everything.
 Then maybe create your own show and you're done!

, If you ever feel like giving up, never in one million years give up. Not even when you reach those times like you think you're not getting any better and is not worth anything at all.
, Use your imagination and the online resources. If you're in a club, ask about events they're willing for you to take part in and have fun with. This will improve not just your appearance, performance and style but your popularity. The more popularity you have, the more people will know you exist and listen to your music.

 This will keep the paint from chipping or peeling away from the casing when you remove the stops. This will also make removing the window stops easier; paint is a surprisingly good adhesive.


Use a thin flat-bar or even a putty knife to separate stubborn joints. This will minimize denting or marring other parts of the window trim.
 Using a hinging motion, swing the top of the window into the room until it is horizontal. Then, twist the window into the opening by lifting up one side and pressing down on the other until the window is free.


Every window is different—some might take a little muscle to remove. Don’t worry about scratching the inside of the jambs while removing the window; it’ll get covered anyway.
If the window is cracked or particularly stubborn, wear gloves and eye protection in case it shatters while removing it.

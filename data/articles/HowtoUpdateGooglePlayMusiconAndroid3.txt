 To launch the Play Store, tap on the white shopping bag with the Play icon in the middle. This should take you to the Play Store main screen.
 Enter “Play Music” in the search field at the top of the screen, and tap the magnifying glass icon to begin the search.


From the results, select the app, and you will be taken to its information page.
 If you don’t want to manually update Play Music every time there’s an update, you can set the app to update automatically. On the information page, tap the three vertical dots at the top right corner of the page. You should see “Auto-update” with a checkbox next to it.


Tap on the checkbox to mark it, enabling auto-updates for Google Play Music. Now, whenever Play Music requires an update, the Play Store will automatically download and install the updates for the app whenever you are connected to a Wi-Fi network.

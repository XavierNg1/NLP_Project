 This step is optional, but many pistachio eaters love to absorb the salty exterior of the nut shell before they crack open the meat within. Put the whole pistachio into your mouth, and let your mouth absorb the salt. Remove from your mouth once the taste subsides.


You can also suck on the shells after you have separated them from the nut. This way, you can simply spit out the shell out into the garbage once you've finished sucking it.
 Once you've removed the shell, the pistachio is ready to consume. You can eat the pistachio raw, or you can add it to a larger dish.


The pistachio nut is relatively soft and oblong. The color should be some combination of green, brown, and purple. Do not worry if the nut skin appears blotchy and mottled â€“ this is normal!.
 Once you have shelled each pistachio, eat the nut and place the nutshell into a discard pile. This might be your hand, or a cup holder, or a separate bowl. If you scatter the shells back in with the unopened pistachios, they will get in the way when you try to eat more of the nuts.

 If you're having trouble sleeping, try relaxation exercises. They can get your mind off of the stress of your pregnancy, as well as any bothersome physical symptoms.You can try a breathing exercise. Breathe in and out in slow, steady breaths. Focus on the air going in and out of your lungs. If there is any tension in your body, release that tension as you breathe. If your mind starts to wander, bring it back to the breath.
Try guided imagery. Imagine a relaxing scenario, like a childhood home or an ideal vacation. Take a mental vacation to that place and try to let go of other thoughts. Imagine all aspects of your imagined getaway, including sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste.
 Where you're sleeping can have an impact on the quality of your sleep. If you're struggling to sleep while pregnant, evaluate your room and make any necessary changes.Try dimming the lights in your room before bed. This will alert your body that it's time to sleep.
Make sure your room environment is relaxing. A room should be calm and peaceful. If your room is cluttered, this can make sleep difficult.
Reduce any bothersome noise. If you live in a noisy neighborhood, use a fan or a noise machine to block out unwanted sounds. Keep your windows closed at night to reduce outside sound.
Remove any blue light sources from your bedroom as well, such as TVs, computer screens, tablets, digital alarm clocks, and cell phones.

 If you don’t have a juicer, blend the beets with 1 cup of water and allow the mixture to sit for 30 minutes. Strain the mixture and reserve the liquid.
 Divide your hair into small sections, then thoroughly spritz each section.
 Use tape to secure the plastic wrap. You can also use a plastic bag; secure it with a few bobby pins or tie it in a knot at the front of your head.
 Allow the beet liquid to fully saturate your hair for at least 2 to 3 hours.
 Rinse your hair until the water runs clear. Don’t shampoo for at least 24 hours.

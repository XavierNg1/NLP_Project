 Most playgrounds have wooden beams of various elevations. Even if there isn't a specific balance beam, you may be able to find a slightly raised surface or a curb that you can use for the same purpose.Walk slowly at first until you find your balance. Turn and walk back slightly faster, then gradually increase your speed each time you cross.
You also can lift each leg up to hip-height with each step, or add a kick to each step. Move your arms naturally at first, but you might experiment with clasping your hands behind your back or keeping your hands on your hips to see how that affects your balance.;
, If the playground has a walking trail or grass perimeter around it, use the space to your advantage. Skipping is a plyometric exercise that lightly builds fast-twitch muscle fiber while also boosting your mood.You also can incorporate arm movements to get an upper-body workout in addition to a cardiovascular warm-up. For example, you can swing your arms vigorously as you skip, or pump them up and down.
Skipping also is great for building strength and toning leg muscles. Do a 60-second skip as a cardio interval between other exercises.
 Jogging isn't necessarily a children's activity, but it's something that's easily accomplished in a park or around a playground. If you think you'd be embarrassed if people saw you skipping, then you might want to jog instead.Once you're warmed up, you might even consider challenging someone nearby to a short race.
Most playgrounds don't have jump ropes lying around, but if you have one of your own you can bring it with you and do a little jumping as a warm-up. Set the timer on your watch or phone and jump at a regular pace for five minutes for an effective cardiovascular warm-up.

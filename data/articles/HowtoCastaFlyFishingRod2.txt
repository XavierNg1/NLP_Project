 In some situations, trees, brush, or anything else that makes it difficult to extend a back cast may limit the movement of your cast. These situations call for a roll cast.A roll cast keeps the line, and therefore the fly, closer to your body, so a hat and sunglasses are recommended while practicing this casting maneuver.
 Use the same relaxed but firm, thumb-forward grip described in the forward-cast method. You should also ensure that there are no tangles down the line.
 The majority of your fly line will still remain in front of you in this position, most likely stretched out across the water.


This isnâ€™t a rapid movement, simply the position you want to be in when you actually begin the roll cast.
 This movement should start gradually and gain speed. The slow initial movement will help you maintain control of the cast, which should be in a straight line.


Instead of unfurling behind you like in a back cast, the fly line will roll out in front of you as the tippet and fly catch up with the forward momentum of the cast.
 Stopping with the rod tip in an upward position gives the fly line more height and room to roll out in front of you.


Casting the rod tip too far forward will sink the rolling line too low, possibly allowing it to contact the ground or water before unfurling.

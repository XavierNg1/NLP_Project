 While barks alone can tell you a lot, looking at body language in combination with barks can tell you a lot more. If you are able to, look at your dog's body while it barks in order to make a better assessment.For example, a dog that is barking repeatedly and loudly may be excited or it may be guarding against someone or something. However, if you see that the dog is in a defensive stance and showing its teeth as well, then you know that it is guarding.
 If your dog is barking you should try to figure out what it is trying to communicate to you. If you understand the conditions that are prompting a specific bark, then you may be able to switch that around next time the dog does that bark and understand that it signals that condition.


For example, it may be telling you that someone is at the front door. If you can identify the specific bark your dog does when someone comes to the door, then the next time your dog does that bark you will know that someone is at your door.
 Barks can be very connected to what your dog wants or expects at certain times of day. If you know that your dog is barking for a specific reason, take the time to identify exactly how that bark sounds to that you can identify it in different circumstances.For example, if your dog needs to be let out to go to the bathroom every morning, pay attention to what that bark sounds like so that you can identify that same bark later.

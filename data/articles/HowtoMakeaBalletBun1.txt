 Get your hair straight and even, brushing it straight back as if you were putting it into a ponytail. A little water can help smooth things out and make your hair more manageable, if need be., If necessary, spray the hair with a quick-drying hairspray. The best height is right on the crown of your head, so that you could just see the top of the ponytail poking up if you look in the mirror.








The tighter you can make this ponytail, the better. It may hurt at first, but it ensures you have fewer wisps of hair coming free and keeps you from having to re-do your bun later.
 It is important to have a strong foundation for your bun so it doesn't fall down. A small elastic will hold the hair in place while you craft your bun. You can then spray a little hairspray onto the ponytail to give it a little extra hold.
 The tighter the better, even though it may hurt a bit to get it prepared.









Some ballerinas like to create their bun in two parts -- splitting their hair in half to make twisting easier. If you do this, simply repeat the following steps for both halves., Follow the direction you twisted in for the best result -- if you twisted clockwise, wrap clockwise. You want to keep the rope of hair close to the ponytail holder. Use bobby pins to start securing everything down.
 Place pins at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and 9 o'clock, if your bun was a clock face. If the first half of your bun feels a little shaky, put more bobby pins in where desired.









Many ballerinas prefer the U-shaped pins, as they capture more hair and hold longer.Repeat these same steps for the second half of your ponytail, if necessary. If you do, make sure your twist and turn the second half the opposite way as the first., l This also helps secure the bun, though it is not strictly necessary.

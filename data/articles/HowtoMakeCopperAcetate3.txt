 These pellets can be found at a chemical supply store or ordered online. Drop them into warm water. Stir the water until the crystals are completely dissolved. The solution should be blue in color.If you have made your own copper acetate solution from household chemicals, this step is not necessary.
 Copper acetate will precipitate spontaneously. You should leave the solution in a cool, dry place. As the water evaporates, copper acetate will be forced out of solution. You will see blue crystals form across the surface of your dish.You can also drop a crystal in the solution to jump start the precipitation.
Put the solution out of reach for small children and pets. If left unattended, pets and small children may ingest the solution. This can lead to acute copper poisoning that can be dangerous or even fatal., Once you have obtained crystals, pour off any remaining solution. Transfer the crystals to a paper towel. Let them sit for a day or two to dry out.

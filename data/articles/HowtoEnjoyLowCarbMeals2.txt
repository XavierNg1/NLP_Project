 A ½ cup of Greek yogurt topped with ½ cup of blackberries or raspberries is a great way to start the day with minimal carbs. You can also add slivered almonds, walnuts, or pecans to up the protein, which will help hold you over until lunch. Add sunflower seeds or flaxseed meal for even further nutrition.To sweeten, add shredded coconut without sugar added.
The type of yogurt matters immensely. Sweetened yogurt, even if it’s non-fat, contains a large amount of carbs. Choose Greek yogurt or a yogurt made with whole milk. The whole milk will make it extra smooth and creamy, and does not add any carbohydrates.
 Eggs are an especially nutritious and enjoyable breakfast option. They can also be cooked easily and quickly. Prepare eggs as you wish, in a skillet with coconut, flaxseed, avocado, or extra virgin olive oil. Add your favorite veggies, such as peppers, onions, and tomatoes. Spinach and kale are especially low in carbs, and add nutrition and sustenance to your dish.Put some grated cheese on the top to add some calcium and flavor without adding any carbohydrates.
Use herbs to season your eggs. Aside from salt and pepper, rosemary, basil, and turmeric are all great additions to omelets or scrambles.
You can even bake eggs into to-go portions by filling a muffin tin with chopped veggies, cheese, and scrambled eggs.
Eggs are also a great addition to any leftovers from dinner the night before.
 As an alternative (or in addition) to eggs, tofu also makes a great breakfast staple, and can used in many of the same ways. Stir-fried tofu with garlic, olive oil, and green beans will taste great, and can be cooked in a matter of minutes., If you can’t stop dreaming about pancakes and waffles, you’re in for a treat after all. Use coconut flour instead of grain-based flours, which have many more carbs. Favor berries over other types of fruit for sweeteners. You can even use blackberries or raspberries to make a delicious syrup.

 Neutralize bleach’s base chemical make-up with foods high in natural acids. Combining an edible liquid acid with bleach is a great way to even out the overall pH and eliminate that unpleasant odor. Use any one of the following foods to neutralize the bleach:


Lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit juice (also lime – any citrus fruit, really)
Vinegar
Tomatoes (tomato sauce, puree, or paste work as well);
, Rub it in well. It’s best to do this for at least a minute as it gives you time to make sure you’ve covered everything. This also allows the liquid to soak in and neutralize the bleach.
 Voila! The smell will hopefully be gone.
 If washing your hands doesn’t work, or you don’t wish to use straight liquid on your hands, dilute these acidic foods 1:1 with water. Then let your hands soak in this mixture for 2-3 minutes.
 Combining a food that is both dry and high in acid content with bleach is a great way to even out the overall Ph and eliminate that unpleasant odor as well. Use one of these dry acids as a rub to neutralize the base:


Baking soda
Coffee grounds

, Take the rub of your choice and do just that: rub it all over your hands. Take your time and rub it in well, much like an exfoliant scrub. Do this for one minute. Wipe off the excess into a trashcan and rinse with hot water. This will allow the rub to penetrate deeply into your pores. If you don’t like the smell of coffee, of course, opt for using baking soda.

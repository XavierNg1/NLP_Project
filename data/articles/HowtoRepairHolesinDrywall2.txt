 Trim away frayed edges with a utility knife and press back into place any small drywall chunks still hanging by a flap.
 This will help the joint compound to stick, if using regular joint compound. This step may be skipped if you're using a non-water-based joint compound containing acrylics, polymer fibers, or other similar non-water-based ingredients.


To clean greasy repair areas (as in a kitchen), use trisodium phosphate or TSP, which can be found at all paint centers.
 Wider putty knife blades will produce smoother results.
 Pull the blade toward you in one steady, smooth motion. Have the blade form about a 30-degree angle with the wallboard. If your finish doesn't look smooth, simply wipe off the putty knife, re-wet it and smooth the mud again, always pulling the blade toward you. Don't bother trying for a perfect finish, as you will have ample opportunity to sand the finish once the compound has dried.


If you're working on a hole requiring several layers of mud, applying a number of thin coats is better than one thick one. That will prevent bubbling and cracking during the drying process. However, this also requires additional drying time in between coats. If you don't have that much time, purchase a quick-drying product (like "Hot Mud") that can be mixed in small, workable quantities that will dry in less than 30 minutes.
 Never apply a second layer of joint compound if the first has not thoroughly dried.
 If there are large blobs or strips, shave these off with the putty knife first.
 Apply this topcoat over pin holes or hairline cracks as if you were trying to scrape it off without leaving any behind. This step can often be accomplished without additional sanding.

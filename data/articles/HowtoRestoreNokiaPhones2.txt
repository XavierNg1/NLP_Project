 Latest Nokia phone releases already run on Windows OS from Microsoft (such as the Lumia series). Still, you have to back up all your phone’s data because restoring your phone to factory settings will delete all its contents and installed applications.
 Access your phone’s App Screen and open its settings by tapping the “gear” icon.
, Tap on the “Reset your phone” option from the About list. A small prompt will appear asking for confirmation of your action. Just tap “Yes” to confirm and begin the restoration.
 Do not interrupt your phone while it resets. Once the process is complete, your phone will reboot and you’ll be able to use it again.
 Copy the files like music, video, or pictures back on your phone.
 Go to the Windows Phone App Store and re-download any apps you want to have back.

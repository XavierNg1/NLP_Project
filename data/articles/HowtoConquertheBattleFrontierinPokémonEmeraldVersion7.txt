 The Battle Tower, which was introduced in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, makes its return in Pokémon Emerald. It is the most standard of the facilities in the sense that there are no special rules here – The objective is just to keep a winning streak for as long as possible. In a Battle Tower challenge, you face Trainers using 3 of your Pokémon. Defeat 7 Trainers in succession in order to clear a set. The Battle Tower tests your ability to keep your win streak going., The Frontier Brain of the Battle Tower is Anabel, also known as the Salon Maiden. She is encountered after the 34th and 69th wins in a streak. This means that Anabel will be the final Trainer of the 5th and 10th consecutive sets. Upon her defeat, she will award the Ability Symbol.

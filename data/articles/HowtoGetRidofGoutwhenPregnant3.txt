 Most of the medications used to treat gout are considered "Category C" by the FDA. What this means is that there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether they are safe or unsafe during pregnancy.Instead of medications, your doctor will usually recommend changes to your diet and lifestyle first.
However, if you have very severe gout (or alternatively, if your gout persists after you have given birth), your doctor may advise you to consider medications.
Note that you should NOT opt for medication use without first consulting your doctor.
 It is extremely effective; however, the evidence supporting its use in pregnant women is inconclusive so far.


Talk to your doctor about the potential risks of taking this drug versus its potential benefits.
 The corticosteroids can be taken in pill form, or injected directly into the affected joint to reduce inflammation - this is likely your best bet, especially while you are pregnant, as a local injection will pose less of a risk of harm to your fetus.
 As you recover from your acute gout attack, Allopurinol may be something to consider moving forwards to give the best chance that this does not happen again.


Your doctor may suggest Allopurinol after giving birth to prevent recurrences of gout.

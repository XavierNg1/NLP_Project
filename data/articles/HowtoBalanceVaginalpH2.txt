 The good bacteria in yogurt and probiotic supplements may help to balance your vaginal pH.Try adding a serving of yogurt to your daily diet to get more beneficial bacteria.


Do not insert yogurt directly into your vagina. It may seem that putting the yogurt directly into your vagina may work better than just eating it, but this is not recommended. The sugars contained in yogurt may cause more problems.
If you want to try a probiotic supplement, make sure that you choose a brand that lists the strains (look for Lactobacillus), species, and genus or the probiotics, a best by date that says how many organisms will still be alive, the manufacturerâ€™s contact information, and the dosage information.As with any supplement, make sure that you check with your doctor first.
 If your vaginal area is itchy or burning, then soaking a clean cotton washcloth in cold water, wringing it out, and applying it to your vaginal area may help provide some relief. Do this as often as needed to help soothe your vaginal area., Vaginal probiotic suppositories have been studied to determine how well they treat bacterial vaginosis, but they have not been studied for use on healthy vaginas.These suppositories are thought to work by repopulating the good bacteria in a woman's vagina, but not enough is known to recommend them for casual use. Talk to your gynecologist before you decide to try any probiotic vaginal suppositories.

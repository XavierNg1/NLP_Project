 When you enjoy a sweet or fattening treat, sip water on the side so that you can focus on the flavor of the food instead of the task of drinking water.
 Even if you intend to order a soda or alcoholic beverage, sipping on water while you peruse the menu can help you anticipate the other beverage even more.
 Make it a habit to always alternate between water and another beverage, have a race with friends or families to drink a glass of water with just a spoon, or take a “shot” of water between servings of other beverages.

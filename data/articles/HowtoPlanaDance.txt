 Planning a dance can seem like a really great idea when you first get it, but be prepared to commit fully and get organized. Sometimes it's more helpful and fun to plan with a friend.;
, Remember, this is your chance to be original. You could do whatever you want, it could just be a casual-dress if you like, but you may have to consider what others would like the theme to be as well. They are the people who you're trying to please!

, A venue is another thing you must plan for well in advance. It isn't recommended to have a dance in someone's house, as you don't have as much freedom as you might want. Make sure you check out the venue before the dance, you don't want any nasty surprises on the night!

, Just anyone who you know will make a good impact on the dance, you don't want any party-poopers or people you don't really know well. It's up to you if you want it to be a girl-boy dance, where everyone comes with a partner. If not it will be just as fun with all of your girl/guy friends there!

, This will give your guests plenty of time to rearrange any other plans in the way. Invitations don't have to be anything special, it could just be an email if you wanted it to be! Just remember to mention the where, when and dress code.
 Just mention in the invitation that they should eat beforehand. You should still provide lots of drinks and snacks though.
 If people are coming with partners, you may want to create a slow-dance-tune for near the end of the dance.
 Give yourself an hour or so for you to get ready then make sure you are back at the venue at least 45 minutes before the guests arrive.

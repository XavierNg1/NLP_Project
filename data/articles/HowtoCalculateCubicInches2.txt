 To calculate the volume of a rectangular space, all you need to know are the values of its dimensions in inches. You may need to physically measure the object or to convert to inches from a different set of units.


For example, if we wanted to find the volume of a refrigerator, we would find its length, width, and depth in inches. Let's say our fridge is 50 inches (127.0 cm) long, 25 inches (63.5 cm) wide, and 20 inches (50.8 cm) deep.
 The first step in calculating a volume with this process is to write one of your dimensions down. You can multiply these dimensions in any order - for our purposes, let's write the length first.


In our example, we would write 50 first, as our fridge is 50 inches (127.0 cm) long.
 Next, multiply your first dimension by one of the others. Again, you can multiply your dimensions in any order, but, for our purposes, let's multiply the length by the width.


In our example, we would multiply 50 × 25 - the width. 50 × 25 = 1250.
 Finally, multiply the answer you got by multiplying two of your object's dimensions by the remaining dimension. In our case, this means multiplying the product of our object's length and width by its depth.


In our example, we would multiply 1250 × 20 - the depth. 1250 × 20 = 25,000.
 You may know that your final answer refers to a volume in cubic inches, but another person may not. Be sure to use a proper label for your answer that specifies that the volume is in cubic inches.


Acceptable labels include:

"Cubic Inches"
"Inches Cubed"
"Cu. In."
"In3"

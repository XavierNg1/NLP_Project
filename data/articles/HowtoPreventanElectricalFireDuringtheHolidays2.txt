 Outdoor lights and decorations are often manufactured to withstand rain, snow, and other harsh elements. Using decorations that are approved for indoor-use only may trigger an electrical fire when coming into contact with certain elements.


Thoroughly read and inspect all decoration packaging to verify that the decorations are safe to use outdoors.
 Using a ladder made from materials other than metal will reduce your risk of becoming shocked, or starting an electrical fire.
 If extension cords and wiring come into contact with standing water, they can trigger an electrical fire or cause electrocution.
 This can prevent electrocution and an electrical fire from starting in the event you accidentally come into contact with a high-voltage power line.

 When we see a new word for the first time, the first impulse most of us have is to try and learn what it means from the context. Sometimes you can get an almost complete sense of the word’s meaning just from the context. At other times, however, it’s obvious that it’s a specialized word, and you’ll need to look it up. But keep honing those context skills – they will stand you in good stead during a vocabulary test!, When you learn a new word, write it down, along with a definition. Keep it on your phone, on your computer, in a notebook – wherever is going to be the most convenient for you to make a note of the new word.
 Even though this might sound counterintuitive, learning or knowing another language can be very helpful when it comes to vocabulary. Since many English words have roots in other languages, if you know another language sometimes it can help you piece together a meaning. For example, many words have Greek or Latin roots. Learning either of these languages (or just learning the important roots) can help immensely in both spelling and understanding words with which you aren’t familiar.

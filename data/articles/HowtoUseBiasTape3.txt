 Use bias tape to measure your fabric. Make sure that there’s a 3 inch overlap of tape. Turn your garment inside out and place the fabric onto a flat surface with the wrong side facing up. You need 3 inches of tape to make sure it overlaps at the point where the two ends of the tape will meet.Stitching along a curved edge can be challenging so using this technique keeps the tape secured with the stitching on the inside and not visible when worn.
 Find the wider side of the bias tape and place it on the back of the fabric. Affix the wide edge with flat hair clips instead of standard sewing pins., The joined tape should be exactly as long as the raw edge of the fabric. Use a water soluble marker and a pin to mark the point at which the tape joins together once you’ve pinched the overlapping ends together., Match the bias tape with same coloured thread and stitch along the joining line. Press the seam open once you have trimmed it to ¼ inch. Keep the bias tape secured to the raw edge of the garment with hair clips., Encase the raw edge of the garment by folding over the tape and stitching it as close to the front edge as you can. Stitch all the way around the project to create an inconspicuous seam, removing the hair clips as you secure the garment within the tape. The two ends of the bias tape should meet once finished.Backtack at the start and end of the stitch.
This should take away bulky overlap and create a tidy seam that won’t be visible when worn.

 Let's use x to represent the percentage. The formula to use when converting a percentage into a GPA (with a scale of 4.0) is (x/20) - 1 = GPA.
 Let's say you have an 89% in Geology. Just plug it into the formula to get the following:


89/20 - 1 =
4.45 - 1 = 3.45.
The GPA equivalent of 89% is 3.45.
 The process will be the same even if your percentage is higher than 100%. Let's say you got a whopping 108% in Algebra. Here's what happens when you plug it in:


108/20 - 1 =
5.4 - 1 = 4.4
The GPA equivalent of 108% is 4.4.
 This may be useful depending on what you are calculating your GPA for. If you are calculating one grade at a time to see how they will add up for your high school GPA, then you may not have to follow this exact formula because all grades will fall within a range anyway. For example, if your grade falls within the range of 83-86, then depending on your high school, then you will have a B, or a 3.0, whether it falls on the higher or lower part of the range or not.Check out your school's GPA system to figure out how to do this; some high schools have a slightly different range for what makes an A- vs. an A, a B vs. a B+, and so on.

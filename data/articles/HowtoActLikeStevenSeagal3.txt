 Even though Seagal was born in Michigan,he has developed what resembles an accent from New Jersey or New York City. Try practicing this accent while speaking in a low, raspy, whisper.


Watch Seagal movies and listen to his interviews if you have trouble emulating his voice.
Practice short one-liners first, then start to incorporate it into daily dialogue.
 Even though he wears sunglasses most of the time to prevent him from squinting, when your shades are off, make sure to squint your eyes and look somewhat annoyed or uncomfortable. This is the key Seagal look in most circumstances.


This look may also be applied when speaking to someone who you're mad or disappointed in.
 Maintain a quiet demeanor. Never look like you're putting forth any effort, even when you're disposing of hundreds of henchmen at once. Your goal is to appear as emotionless and chill as possible at all times.


Practicing Aikido and Buddhism may help you with this.

 This button is positioned in the upper left corner of the Firefox browser window.


Clicking the “Firefox” button should open a drop-down menu with a variety of setting-related options.
 Select “History” in the right-hand column of the double-column drop-down menu.


“History” should be the second option in this second column. Hovering over it should cause another menu to pop out from the side.



“Clear Recent History” is the second option on this menu. Clicking on it will cause the “Clear Recent History” dialogue box to open in a separate window.
 In the "Clear Recent History" dialogue box, Firefox will ask you to set the "Time range to clear." Click on the arrow on the adjacent drop-down menu and select "Everything" in order to clear your entire Internet history.


The other options include "Last Hour," "Last Two Hours," "Last Four Hours," and "Today." Selecting any of these options will only erase the history that falls within that time frame. Anything before that span of time will not be erased.
 The "Clear Recent History" dialogue box also has a "Details" option with a downward arrow next to it. Click on this arrow to expand your options.


You can specify which pieces of Internet history you wish to clear underneath these details.
 Check the checkbox next to "Cache." Also select any other pieces of Internet history you want to clear.


Your other options include "Browsing & Download History," "Form & Search History," "Cookies," "Active Logins," "Offline Website Data," and "Site Preferences." Note that "Form & Search History" may be grayed out, making you unable to check it.
 The "Clear Now" button is located at the bottom of the "Clear Recent History" dialogue box.


Clicking on this button will wipe away your cache and any other type of browsing history you selected. There is no "undo" option, and these changes are permanent.

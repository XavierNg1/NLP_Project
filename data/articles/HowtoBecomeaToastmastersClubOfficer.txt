 Toastmasters International has more than 12,000 clubs in over a hundred countries, and most cities in the U.S. have several clubs to choose from. Each club has its own culture so visit several to find the best fit for you.


Ask whether your employer sponsors a Toastmasters club for its employees. Company clubs are generally only open to employees and meet on company property. Membership dues and other club expenses are paid for by the company. Joining a company club may help you advance your career.
Join a community club -- if your employer doesn't offer a company club, if the location and meeting times are more convenient, or if you'd like to network with individuals outside your company.
Consider a special interest club. There are clubs that work with prisoners or teens, clubs that combine their meetings with meals at area restaurants and clubs that do work in the community in addition to their regular meetings.;
, You will be asked to fill a variety of meeting roles such as timer or evaluator and to make speeches during the meetings. Most clubs formally induct their members in a short ceremony. You will also have to pay a new member fee and semi-annual dues.
 The president will discuss with you which officer positions suit your experience and expertise. Available officer positions are: president, vice president education, vice president membership, vice president public relations, sergeant at arms, secretary and treasurer.
 A smaller club will be forced to rely on volunteers or even require that members fill certain positions in rotation.
 Each officer is provided with a manual that outlines his or her responsibilities, while the semi-annual training provides tips from Toastmasters with experience in the role.

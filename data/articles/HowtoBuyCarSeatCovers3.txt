 Most Internet sites feature wide selections, but they may require you to pay shipping costs and wait weeks for your car seat covers to arrive. Brick and mortar stores may offer smaller selections and higher prices, but they allow you to get the covers immediately without a shipping charge.
 One of the main functions of car seat covers is to protect the original seats in your car, but if the current seating is already old and damaged, it may not be worth it to purchase top of the line covers.
 Many retailers lower the price you pay per cover when you buy a certain amount, especially when you buy seat covers online.

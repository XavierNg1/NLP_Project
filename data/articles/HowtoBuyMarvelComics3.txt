 Some events are free of charge and open to all, while others require you to purchase a form of identification which will allow you into the designated seller's area.
 Sellers will usually have current issues of many series and also carry a number of past and rare issues.
 Briefly flip through each comic book to make sure it is in a suitable condition and you enjoy the content enough to buy it.
 Many vendors at conventions and trade shows do not have credit card machines, and thus require that you pay with cash. Most venues have automated teller machines (ATM) if you find yourself short on cash. Vendors may charge you tax on the comic, which is usually not included on the sticker price.

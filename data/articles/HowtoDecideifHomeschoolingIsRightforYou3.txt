 Before making a decision about homeschooling, look up the rules pertaining to your state. Homeschooling is legal in all states, but some states may require you to outline the curriculum you’ve chosen to teach, or provide proof of your own educational qualifications.Visit the Home School Legal Defense Association’s website at https://www.hslda.org/laws for the homeschooling regulations of your state.
 One of the biggest draws of homeschooling is the ability to develop a unique curriculum for your child, but that endeavor may be overwhelming to some. There are also pre-made curriculums available, which are ideal for those who are new to homeschooling as they are simple to follow, establish a schedule for learning, and allow for simple record-keeping. Start with a free pre-packaged program, many of which are available online.For instance, visit lessonpathways.com – a free web service offering online resources for homeschooling.
 Homeschooling cooperatives are groups of families who join together to educate their children. Families can split up teaching and activity-planning between themselves, with responsibilities being divided based on preferences, experience, availability and resources. Search online for homeschooling cooperatives near you; with home education rising in popularity, the number of support groups and resources is constantly growing., Extracurricular activities can provide homeschooled kids with social opportunities and friendships, physical activity, team participation and leadership skills; they can also give your child an advantage when applying to college.

Allow your child to choose an activity that reflects their interests, which could include:joining the Scouts or Girl Guides
music lessons
team sports (e.g. soccer, basketball)

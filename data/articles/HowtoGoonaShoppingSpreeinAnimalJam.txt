 Gems are important (because it's the main currency of Animal Jam) and you will need a lot for something as a shopping spree. A recommended amount of gems for your spree is 2,500 to 5,000. Remember, you can always get more if wanted. However, you will be skipping this step if you already have enough.;
, You don't want to go crazy and buy clothing if you only have 187/200 slots left. If you want to go on a shopping spree for only one certain item category (clothes, den items) then you should either make sure you have enough slots (10-200 slots is enough) or you should delete items to get to enough.
 Avoid Epic Wonders unless if you have enough gems. Ideas would normally include Jam Mart Clothing or Jam Mart Furniture, but there are many other stores (besides the Diamond Shop) where everything costs gems. These include the Flag Shop, Claws n Paws, Sarepia Forest plant shop, Conservation Museum shop, Hot Cocoa Hut shop, Mystery Emporium, Adventure Base Camp shop, Secret Eagle shop, and many more. You could even go on a den shopping spree if you wanted.
 Make sure you won't regret it. However, you do not need to spend all your money, it's just an option that makes it more shopping spree-ish.
 There's no point in spending all that money if you aren't going to use it one something! Redo your den or try on your new clothes.

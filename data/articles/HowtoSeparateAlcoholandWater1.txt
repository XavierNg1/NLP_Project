 The most simple distillation system uses a round-bottomed glass flask (or boiling flask), a condensing unit, and a second glass container for the separated liquid. Using a fractional (or fractionating) column inserted between the boiling flask and the condensing unit is recommended for separating alcohol and water.The simple distillation system requires the two liquids have a large difference in boiling points.
The simple distillation system uses less heat, and is easier to set up, but provides less accuracy in separating alcohol from water.
Another word for the closed distillation system is a still, which is derived from the word distillation.;
, The boiling point of water is 100 Celsius, and the boiling point of alcohol is 78 Celsius. Thus, alcohol evaporates into steam quicker than water.Use a heat source whose temperature can be quickly raised or lowered, such as a heating mantle.
You can also use a standard propane or electric heating source.
 The fractionating column is a straight glass cylinder lined with metal rings, or glass or plastic beads. These rings or beads help trap the less volatile gases at the lower levels of the column.As the vapor rises from the distilling liquid, only the most volatile liquid rises to the top.
In a mixture of alcohol and water, alcohol would make its way to the top ring.
Insert a thermometer to gauge the temperature of the gases inside the system.
 As the vapor makes its way into the condensing column, it will be in a cooler setting. Being in this cooler place, it will revert into liquid, i.e., condense.As the vapor condenses to liquid, it will become heavier. The liquid alcohol will then drop into the collection vessel.
The condensing column may be lined with cooling water to speed the process.

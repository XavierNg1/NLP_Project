 Only fry until soft; avoid browning them.;
,, Leave to simmer for 20 minutes.
 You can puree using a masher by hand, or with an electric wand blender. If you don't have a wand blender, and use a bench-top blender, you will need to let the soup cool to a warm temperature first; be careful not to fill to the top (the lid can blow off when too much warm liquid is there) and do not blend hot liquid.
 Add a dollop of yogurt (if using) and serve with crusty bread and some salad on a side plate.

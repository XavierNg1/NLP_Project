Ensure that your palm is facing down and flat and that the strap fits snug (essentially giving your handboard a high five).;
,, Take the other hand and place over the hand in the strap. With your body outstretched, kick and you will move forward quickly out past the breaking waves.
 Getting out to the break is a lot easier with a handplane. By placing the board out in front of you and kicking, the board keeps you buoyant and the kicking moves you forward. As the wave comes toward you, simply kick forward under the water and the wave with flow over you.
, Once you get used to it you will find you will use the freestyle stroke less and less as you learn to judge the waves better.


The secret to this part is timing. Too fast and you are out in front of the wave. Too slow and the wave rolls over you.
 The forward momentum of the wave will pick you up and carry you with it.
 Go for it! Stop stroking. Streamline your body and keep kicking down to a minimum. Become a human surfboard. Your fins are now your rudder and the board is the bow of your ship.



At this point there are various options for the free arm. Leave it out to hang free, or bring it over to lay on top of the hand in the strap.

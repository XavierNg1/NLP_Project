 A pregnancy test is very accurate if you take it after you should have had your period. You can buy pregnancy tests at drugstores, big box stores, and grocery stores. You'll find them with either the family planning products or feminine hygiene products.A few tests are accurate before your missed period, but it should say so on the box.Take the test when you wake up, as it will be more accurate. Follow the directions on your box, but generally, you urinate on one end of a stick that has a test strip. After you're done, put it on a flat surface.
Give it about five minutes or so to work. The package should tell you what to be looking for. Some tests show two lines for pregnant, while others are a single blue line., Most of the time, if you get a negative result, you're not pregnant. However, if you did the test too early (before your first missed period), it may come back with a negative result even if you are pregnant. If you want to be sure, you may need to take the test again.Try taking it again after you should have had a period.
 Although modern home pregnancy tests are highly accurate, you want to be 100% sure. Plus, if you are pregnant, you'll want to make a plan, such as deciding if you want to keep the baby or starting prenatal care. You can either take a confidential urine test at a family planning clinic like Planned Parenthood or at your physician's or gynecologist's office.Even if a urine test is positive, your doctor may draw blood to confirm that you are pregnant. Then the doctor can help you figure out a plan.

While your interests and expertise should play a big role in how you decide what you want to acquire and sell, your start-up funds will also play a big role. You can take out small business loans to acquire inventory but this is not a sound strategy for antiques. You'll be better off taking your time and using your own money you are able to spare from life expenses.For example, if you want to sell antique cars, the initial investment will be considerably larger than if you are looking to sell vintage toys or rugs. You can get small-business loans to cover inventory acquisition, but this can be risky because market prices fluctuate so greatly, quickly undercutting your profit margins. Also, many antique dealers gain their inventories over time through smart, economical purchases, so a large start-up capital is not as necessary., If you want to become an antiques dealer, you're going to need to learn how to recognize good buys and their potential for re-sale.

Keep your inventory fresh and profits moving.

 Recognize you are human, and you make mistakes just like everyone else, sometimes pretty hilariously.A little lighthearted ribbing might be good to help you lighten your perspective.


If you are having a hard time finding the humor in a joke about you, try taking the perspective of an outsider. Retell the joke in your head but about somebody else, perhaps somebody you don't even know. This may help you reduce your defensiveness.
 If a person is sharing something about you that you might have liked to keep under wraps, take control of your story. Interrupt the joker by correcting or elaborating on some aspect of the story and then finish telling it. Others would probably prefer to hear it from you, so they will likely direct their attention to you rather than the joker.


Embarrassing moments are less embarrassing when you make a joke of it, so take this as an opportunity to rid yourself of some negative feelings.
 Show the joker you aren't bothered by the joke by making an even better one about yourself. Self-depricating humor is excellent for diffusing tense situation, as it makes you more relatable. Others will feel more comfortable with themselves and the situation, when they see you can laugh at yourself.This will shift other's attention to you and help you to take control of the situation.
An easy way to set up your one up joke is "That was nothing, you should have seen the time Iâ€¦"

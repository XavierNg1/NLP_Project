 If you've escaped the situation, try to breath deeply. Chances are that you may be experiencing feelings of panic or shock or numbness due to the trauma, so it's best to try to get your bearings by centering your focus on your breathing.When you feel able to talk, you should call your family and loved ones to let them know that you're alright.
 Law enforcement's first task is to stop the shooter, so as you emerge from the building or public place, always keep your hands up to show that you are not carrying any weapons. Police are trained to initially treat everyone as a suspect since some shooters pretend to impersonate victims., The police have specific guidelines on how to proceed during a public shooting. Let them do their jobs and don't confuse or aggravate the situation by intervening, particularly since your emotions are likely heightened. Let them do their jobs effectively and take down the shooter., The police are trained to locate and stop shooters and this is their primary goal. They will not stop and tend to the injured, but you needn't worry as paramedics have likely already been called to care for those shot or otherwise hurt during the incident.If you have been shot, try to slow your breathing which can help prevent shock and slow the bleeding. Cover the wound with your hands or a cloth and apply pressure to try to stop the bleeding until you can get medical aid.

 OSX is able to create disc images natively using the Disk Utility. Disk utility can be accessed in “Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility”.


Third party disc image creation software, like Roxio Toast or Nero can be used as well.
 Highlight the disc listing and press “New Image” or Go to “File > New > Disc Image from Device.”

, Enter a name for the image file, select a format, and save location.


Both Read-Only and Compressed format choices will create a .dmg filetype. Read-Only are larger but faster. For the purposes of mounting a disc to play a game, either will work fine.
When the image creation is complete, you can eject the disc from the optical drive.
 Simply double click the image file to mount - no third party software necessary. You can also mount using the Disk Utility with “File > Open Disc Image”. The computer will now function as though the disc were inserted to the optical drive.

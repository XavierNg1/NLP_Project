 In Spanish, the word "madre" means "mother." Start with the same "mah" sound as before (rhymes with "raw").


Here, the accent is on the first syllable even though there's no mark over the a. In general, for Spanish words without accent marks that end in a vowel, the second-to-last syllable gets the accent., This syllable should rhyme with "pay." The r sound in Spanish is something that's often a little tricky for English speakers to pronounce properly. The sound you want to use is very light and resembles the English d sound. Thus, the actual pronunciation is a little like "duh-day," with the "duh" being very quick and light.


Having trouble with the Spanish r? Try using your tongue differently than you would in English. Normally, you'd say your rs at the back of your throat, but this time try to pronounce them by touching your tongue to the front of the roof of your mouth. Flick it towards the middle part of the roof of your mouth as you say "duh-day."

, The word "madre" all together should sound like "MAH-duh-day." Again, the middle "duh" should be as short and delicate as possible.


This is a more formal way to say "mom," but it's still sometimes used similarly to "mamá." "Madre" is used almost exactly like "mother" is in English. The rare exception is in some Mexican dialects where the word is used as a slang term for "uncool" or "failed."Again, if you're using this word as a noun in a sentence, you should use the article "la." For instance: "La madre dijo, 'limpia tu habitación.'" ("The mother said, 'clean your room.'")

 Most Pokémon evolve into a stronger form when a certain level is attained or a special item is used.Go through your Pokémon cards and pick out all Pokémon that are in the same evolutionary series. Start with the lowest evolution Pokémon and put all higher evolutions together with it. This will likely create many stacks, depending on the volume of your collection.


While many Pokémon evolve, some do not. All single evolution Pokémon can be grouped together., Now that your cards are separated by evolution, you should think about how you want to organize these groups. You might want to alphabetize your evolutions, or you could group these according to type, keeping all like-type evolutions together.


Even if you divide your evolutions into like-type categories, it can still be difficult to easily find evolutions within the type grouping. To further organize your like-type sets, you might want to alphabetize all evolutions within like-type sets., Place your cards into your binder, box-sleeve, or catalog according to your evolutionary organization. To make sure your cards are easily accessible, you may want to create sections in your binder, use separate boxes, or use different drawers for each category you have organized your evolutions into.


For example, if you are using box-sleeves, you might keep all your fire evolutions together and label the box "Fire Types." If you've chosen to use a binder, you can create section dividers to keep types separate with tabs.

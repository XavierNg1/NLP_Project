 Dilute a small amount of bleach in water and dip the stained part of the clothing into the liquid. The stain may come off immediately, or may require soaking.


If you need to soak the item, just keep on eye on the fabric to ensure the bleach doesn't begin to dissolve it.
Once the stain has disappeared, you should wash the item immediately, as normal.
 Satin fabrics respond well to a mixture of one tablespoon each of milk and white vinegar and one teaspoon each of borax and lemon juice.Mix the solution in a small cup, then apply directly to the stain and let it sit for 10 minutes.
Take a clean, dampened sponge and use it to dab (not rub) at the fabric until the stain comes away.
 Stains on sturdier fabric, such as towels and sheets, can be removed with a little acetone or rubbing alcohol. Simply pour a little of either of these liquids onto a clean cotton ball and use this to dab at the stain until it disappears. Wash the items immediately.
 Citrus juice, such as that from a lemon or lime, can be used to gently remove marker stains from most items of clothing, without fear of bleaching or staining. Simply apply a little of the freshly squeezed juice directly to the stain and dab with a cotton ball or clean cloth until it disappears.


For more fragile fabrics, dilute the citrus juice to half strength with water first. Wash the item of clothing immediately.
 Pour rubbing alcohol into a cleaning cloth. Dab the cloth onto the carpet stain. As with any carpet stain, do not rub or you'll spread the stain and weaken the fibers. Keep dabbing until the stain lifts off.Alternatively, spray a little hairspray on the stain and use a clean towel to dab away.
Once the stain has been removed (using either of these methods) dampen the carpet with a little water then use a clean towel to blot dry.

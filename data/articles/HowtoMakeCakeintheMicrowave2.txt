 In a large bowl, combine 3/4 cup softened butter or margarine with 3/4 cup sugar and 2/3 cup flour. Stir together with a spoon or rubber spatula.









It's okay to use regular flour if you don't have self-rising, but the cake will end up more like a brownie in texture.
 Pour in 3 tablespoons of milk. Crack in 3 medium eggs, and add 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.









You can use whole, fat free, 2%, or whatever type of milk you prefer.
 For a chocolate cake, add 1/3 cup cocoa powder. For a vanilla cake, add another teaspoon of vanilla extract.
 Stir well with a fork or use an electric mixer to mix for about 4-5 minutes or until smooth. If you have a food processor, you can add all of the ingredients to the food processor for about 60 seconds to mix instead.
 This is important––never use a metal baking pan for microwave baking.









A shallow dish will probably give you the best results.
 Cook the cake in the microwave for 3-4 minutes on full power. The cake will bubble and puff in the microwave just as it would in the oven. Just as it starts to set (it'll still be jiggly), it's done.Check to see if the cake is baked by sticking a toothpick straight down into the center. The toothpick should come out clean. If there is gooey cake residue on the toothpick, put the cake back in the microwave and cook it in 1 minute increments until done.
Take care not to overcook. If you microwave the cake for too long, it will likely dry out.
 Served warm, this cake is super moist and totally irresistible. Top with frosting and decorate if you'd like.

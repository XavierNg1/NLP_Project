 Fill two-thirds of a small to medium saucepan with water. Set the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat and bring the water to a boil.


If desired, you can add salt to the water after it reaches a boil. Doing so can draw more flavor out of the corn as it cooks. Do not add the salt before the water boils, however, since doing so will increase the amount of time required to bring the water up to temperature.
 Add the baby corn to the boiling water. Cover the saucepan and reduce the heat to medium, then cook the corn until it becomes tender-crisp.You should be able to easily pierce the corn with a fork, but it should still have some “bite” or crispness. Do not cook it past the tender-crisp stage.
 Drain the water and serve the cooked baby corn while it's still hot.


Consider serving the corn with melted butter. You can even season the butter with fresh herbs.
You can reserve any leftovers by keeping them in a sealed container in your refrigerator, but you should try to use these leftovers within one or two days.

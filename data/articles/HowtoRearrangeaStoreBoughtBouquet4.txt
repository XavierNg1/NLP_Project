 Before you arrange the flowers, you have to make the stems ready. To do this, start by cutting the stems approximately one and a half times the height of your container. This makes sure you don’t have greenery or flowers of different heights. It also helps make sure your flowers aren’t too tall or too short.After cutting your stems, make sure to cut away all leaves that will be below the mouth of the vase.
 There are a few ways you can arrange the height of your flowers. They can all be the same basic height. You can also make a uniform cluster of flowers that create an orb-shaped dome.To create a dome, start by placing four flowers together in a square shape at the same height. This is the center of the done. Add one flower at a time out from the center to create the tight cluster.If you want to get a bit more creative, try varying the height of the stems. Place some taller flowers in the center or back of the arrangement with shorter ones in the front.
 Before you arrange your flowers, make sure to get rid of any flowers that are not in the best shape. These flowers might be wilted, damaged, broken, or messed up in some other way. Only place the prettiest flowers into the vase.You also should look at the greenery. Toss any wilted or damaged greenery.
If there are damaged leaves on good flowers, just clip the leaves.

 This basic Greek salad with dressing is relatively easy and makes 6 to 8 servings. You can leave out ingredients according to taste. Here's what you'll need:


2/3 cup grams feta cheese, cubed
1 head of romaine lettuce
4 tomatoes cut in wedges
1 cucumber, unpeeled, cut in rounds
1 large red onion, peeled and cut in fine wedges
1 teaspoon dried oregano
15 to 20 pitted black olives
Salt to taste
2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil;
, Wash the head of romaine lettuce well to rid it of any pesticides. Tear the washed lettuce into small, bite-sized pieces by hand and place the lettuce pieces into a large serving bowl.If you want your lettuce to come out in more uniform pieces, use a knife to chop up your lettuce instead of tearing it.
If you're not a fan of romaine, feel free to substitute your favorite lettuce, like butter lettuce or iceberg lettuce.
 Peel the red onion and slice it thinly. Chop the cucumber into rounds and the tomatoes into wedges. Place the fresh ingredients on top of the lettuce in the serving bowl., Sprinkle the salad with crumbled feta cheese. Top it off with pitted kalamata olives. Sprinkle the salad with a dash of dried oregano. If you donâ€™t have access to kalamata olives for whatever reason, black olives work just as well as a substitute.
Freshly chopped oregano can be substituted for dried oregano.
 Squeeze the juice of half a lemon over the mixed salad. Drizzle plenty of olive oil over the bowl.Season the salad by sprinkling salt and pepper onto the salad mix. Toss the salad to allow all of the ingredients to get a bit of the oil and seasoning.
Taste the salad to see if it needs any additional seasoning or oil and feel free to adjust as needed.

 When your dog is at lakes, rivers, and the ocean, don’t let them swim too far out. Dogs can tire easily and may not realize how far they have swum out before turning around. Lakes and oceans can get deep very fast. This can be a risk to your dog.Keep your dog close to you and to the shore to avoid fatigue and any drowning risk.
 Pay attention to all signs posted around the body of water. If there are signs around the water saying “Do Not Swim” or “Beach Closed,” this means your dog should stay out of the water and area, too.This ensures that your dog stays safe.
 Though it may be a warm day, the water in the lake, river, or ocean may not be warm enough for your dog to swim in. Always test the water before you let your dog go in to make sure it is not too cold.If your dog goes swimming in cold water, it can lead to hypothermia.
 Snakes are common around sources of natural water, especially rivers and lakes. When you are with your dog in areas that are prone to snakes, you should keep your dog on a leash. Keep them close to you and don’t let them go running off where you can’t see.Keep your dog out of places where snakes may hide, like areas with tall grass and piles of wood.
If your dog gets bitten by a snake, take them to the vet immediately.
 Whenever your pet is around a body of water, you should make sure to supervise them. Accidents can happen suddenly, and your dog may drown quickly. By watching your dog, you ensure their safety.Keeping an eye on your dog also means you keep others safe. For example, if your dog is running around, they might trip someone or push another pet into the water.
If you do not want to worry about supervising your dog while you are at the water, leave them at home.

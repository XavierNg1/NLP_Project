 If you don't like either it would be a bad idea for you to be looking after them. They will likely be able to tell and not want you to be near them.;
, even in small towns, there is usually at least one program for senior citizens, and sometimes many for children.
 Try to show the interviewer that you love children/seniors. It would generally be a good idea for you to be kind but professional, but not so kind or nice that you come across as not sane. No one wants a crazy person working with the elderly or children

, These will mainly be common sense like never shake a baby and never hit the client. But there will also be emergency protocol and non-basics such asÂ ;What to do when someone is injured, how to administer medication,how to keep someone safe in the event of an attack, and what to do if someone dangerous or unexpected happens.
 Always try to make their day nice.
 No one wants a caregiver that does nothing but say a few words now and again. If all you do is the bare minimum, prepare to get fired very soon

, Most of the time it doesn't matter, unless of course you're in charge of medicine at the facility at which you are working. Just make sure you remember what they taught you about emergencies and have some first aid training just in case.
 This can be a fun and relaxing time for the as they may not get outside often. Walks are also a great way to become acquainted and have some group exercise too!

, Many of the elderly are unable to drive or simply just do not have a car. They would greatly appreciate it if you were to help them out with this.
 Again, this could potentially be such a great help to them

, Accidents can occur any time. Have you car in an accessible spot, know where your keys are, and have an emergency plan.

, Your mixture should now be a paste of the vinegar, flour, and salt.
 You can put a glove on your hand, dip it into the paste, and then spread it onto your bronze piece. You can also use a sponge. If your item is something small, like a piece of jewelry, place the jewelry in the bowl. Be sure that your item is completely covered in the paste. Then, leave the paste on for 1-2 hours.
 After 1-2 hours, bring your item to the sink and rinse it under warm water. If your item is large and canâ€™t be moved, bring a pot or bucket of warm water over to it, and pour the water over the item to rinse the paste off completely.
 While you are drying the bronze, rub it with the cloth to remove any marks. Make sure it is completely dry and that all the paste is removed.
 Add a few drops of olive oil to a soft clean cloth and rub it over the surface of your bronze. Olive oil has been a method for cleaning and protecting bronze since ancient times.

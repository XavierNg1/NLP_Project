 For example, if your name is John Smith, say “Mon nom est John Smith.” “Mon nom est” is pronounced “mohn nohm ay,” and literally means “My name is.”Reserve this introduction for formal situations, such as when you’re giving a speech or correcting an individual who mispronounces your name. This introduction method is considered more serious and formal than the casual introduction outlined in Method One.

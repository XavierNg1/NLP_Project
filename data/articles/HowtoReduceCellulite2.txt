 Prolonged inactivity will increase fat deposits and decrease muscle mass, making fatty deposits bigger and more noticeable. Aim to walk 10,000 or more steps per day.
 Do a medium to high intensity aerobic exercise for 30 to 60 minutes 5 times per week. You will decrease total body fat as well as cellulite deposits.
 As body fat decreases, strengthening the muscles will firm your hips, thighs and buttocks. These exercises are some of the best ways to make cellulite less noticeable.


Do squats. Stand in front of a mirror with feet hip width apart. Put your weight into your heels and squat down until your thighs are parallel with the floor. Pause at the bottom and slowly return to standing. Repeat 10 to 20 times. Hold free weights while squatting as you get stronger.
Do planks. Get into a push up position with your body forming a straight line from heels to shoulders. Hold the position steady for 30 seconds to 2 minutes.
Do lunges. Stand with feet slightly less than hip width apart. Step forward with your right foot approximately 3 feet (0.9Â m). Bend both knees until your left shin is parallel with the ground. Raise back up to standing. Repeat 10 to 20 times on both sides. Also, do side lunges to work your inner and outer thigh muscles.
Use the hip adductor and abductor machines at the gym. Do 3 sets of 10 to 12 with the highest weight you can handle. They work your inner and outer thigh muscles. Repeat every other day.
 Do more weights or start jumping rope, taking fitness classes or doing sprints to further tone your legs and buttocks.

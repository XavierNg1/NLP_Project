 The most classic look available is a matte red lip. Matte lipsticks are the longest lasting and won’t feather over time, making them ideal for a long day at work or a night out at a concert.
 For a more modern red look, try a glossy red lipstick. Unlike the sparkly red glosses of our pre-teen days, glossy reds are now made to add a sophisticated touch to your lips. Wear a glossy red lipstick as a stand-alone color, or layer it over a matte shade for extra long wear., Lip stains are an up-and-coming in the world of makeup; they are a liquid lipstick/gloss hybrid that stains your lips with a matte finish for over 12 hours. On the downside, they can be difficult to remove. Consider a lip stain as an ultra-long wear alternative to a traditional lipstick.
 If you’re not quite ready to take the plunge into a full-on lipstick, test the waters by using a red tinted moisturizer. These hued balms have enough color to add the traditional rouge to your lips, but are easy to remove and slightly translucent. They tend to have a slightly glossy finish.

 Add about 3 inches (7.62 cm) of compost for every 100 square feet (30.48 square m) of land. Potting mix has fertilizer built in, so you will not need to add compost to it.;
, Make as many 1 inch (2.54 cm) holes as snow pea seeds you plan on planting. Space each hole 2 inches (5.08 cm) apart.



If you are growing snow peas in the ground in rows, space each row 18 inches (45.7 cm) apart so that the peas have plenty of room to grow.
, Dwarf varieties, such as Snowbird or Dwarf Gray Sugar, only reach about 24 inches (.61 m) in height and do not need stakes or support. Look at the seed packet to determine what variety of sugar pea you're planting.
 You don't want to risk hurting the peas' roots by using a hoe or digging too deeply.
 Aim the water at the soil, not the leaves, to prevent any fungal infections from forming and spreading.


Wait until the top 3 inches (7.62 cm) of soil have dried before watering again. Too much water can cause the roots to rot and inhibits the growth of the plant.
You may notice that the sugar peas need more water right when they begin to produce flowers. It's okay to increase the amount you water at this point to encourage healthy fruit production.
 This locks in moisture and protects the plants from heat as the weather warms up.
 The seeds inside the pod will still be flat and not rounded like garden peas.


Pods are usually ready to pick 1 week after the pea plant has produced flowers.
Once the snow pea plant has begun to produce pods, pick them at least every other day for the best taste and texture. Pods left on the plant too long become stringy. Remove pods regularly to encourage the plant to produce more blossoms and pods.
If you do miss a pod or two and the seeds inside become large, use them as you would garden peas. Don't eat the outer pod on overly mature snow peas, as it will be stringy and tough.

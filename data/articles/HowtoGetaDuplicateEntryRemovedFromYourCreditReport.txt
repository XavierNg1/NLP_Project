 You are entitled to one free credit report each year. This report includes information from all three credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). It can be accessed by visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com/, calling 1-877-322-8228, or mailing your request to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-528. You will need your name, Social Security number, and address to access your report., Credit reporting agencies sometimes accidentally report multiple entries for the same debt on your credit report. In other cases, creditors report make the mistake of reporting the same debt to a reporting agency twice. Regardless of how it happened, you're left with a duplicate entry on your report that, if negative, can have negative consequence for your credit score and your ability to get a loan. If you think you see a double entry, double check documents related to the debt and the account numbers on the credit report., If you have defaulted on an account and your creditor has sold your debt to a collections agency, you will have multiple entries on your report for this debt. However, the reporting agencies do not consider this a duplicate and there is nothing you can do.But if the collections agency sells that debt to another party (as they often do), there may be one or many more additional entries on your credit report that should not be there.
Entries from multiple collections agencies (those no longer own your debt) can and should be removed., Multiple student loan debts may be reported on your credit report because each disbursement (each school year or semester) counts as a separate debt. Unless there are true duplicates (multiples of the same disbursement), there is no need to worry about having many student loan entries on your credit report., You will need documentation of the duplicate entries. You should make copies of the duplicate entries on your credit report. You should also include any statements or contracts you have with the lender, or any other documents related to your debt that can help prove that the entry is a duplicate. This information should be included with your letter., Start by addressing the letter and writing a header. This will include both your information and that of your recipient. Include the following:


Your name
Address
City, State, Zip
Date
Recipient's Name
Title
Company Name
Street Address
City, State, Zip
Re: Recipient's name, Write that you are disputing what you believe to be a duplicate entry. Include the company or account names as stated on the credit report, as well as the amount of the debt.For example:In reviewing the attached credit bureau report, I have detected an error. The following account and/or entry is a duplicate of the same debt. I have attached a copy of this error.
 You will need to make it clear that you are requesting that the duplicate entry be eliminated. Make your request as clear and actionable as possible. Remind your recipient that they have 30 days to investigate the dispute and respond under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).For example: My credit report shows that you have submitted a duplicate of the same account. Under the provisions of the 1977 Fair Credit Reporting Act, I hereby request that your agency fix my account. As stated in the Act, I am giving you a 30 day notice as of this letter's due date to fix this issue. This letter was sent certified mail, return receipt requested. I expect a response within the 30 day period, with proof of action from you. I request a copy of my new error-free credit report by mail a letter from you stating that the account is fixed and error free. Should I not hear from you, I will follow up with whatever action necessary to cause my report to be corrected.
 Include your own contact information so that the bureau may contact you. Write in your email address, phone number, and appropriate hours at which they may call you. You can also simply ask that they respond by mail, but keep in mind this is the slowest option.


For example: "Please feel free to contact me by my email: your_email@mai.com. Or call me during this hours 0:00am-0:00am and after 0:00pm-0:00pm. My phone number is (000)-00-0000. Sincerely, (Your Name)"

, Call or send your letter to the creditor related to the duplicated debt entry. The duplicate may simply be a case of the creditor accidentally reporting the debt twice. Alternately, they may say that there is no error on their end, meaning that you should contact the credit reporting agencies to get the duplicate removed., The three credit reporting agencies are Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. Visit their respective websites to learn where exactly you need to send your letter and to whom it should be addressed. Make sure you sent your letters via certified mail.Keep a copy of your letter., The creditor or credit reporting agency has 30 days to respond to your dispute. If you still have not heard anything at this time, contact each party and check to see if any changes have been made and, if they haven't, what the problem is. You may need to call them or write a follow-up letter. Keep documentation of all of these communications in case you have to build a court case later., Failure to respond within 30 days is a violation of FCRA. If you still haven't heard from the credit reporting agencies or creditors after writing follow-up letters and waiting another few weeks, hire a consumer law attorney. You can take your case to court and then have a chance to win monetary compensation to cover your attorney and court costs, as well as damages. You will also get the entries on your credit report corrected.

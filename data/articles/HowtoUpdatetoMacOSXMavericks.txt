 Your computer will tell you that it needs to shutdown to install the update; click "Yes". Select your Hard Disk as the location to where you want Mavericks to be installed. Then an X in a circle should come up and it will start installing Mavericks onto your computer.
 Now go to your User and open it; you now have OS X Mavericks running on your computer!

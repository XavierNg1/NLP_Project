 Double-click this file to run the installation wizard, which will install the game on your computer.
 A confirmation message will appear once the process is complete.
 Open the COD: Ghosts folder again and look for a file or folder called “Crack”. Since the installer you downloaded is not a legitimate copy, you need to “crack” it open for it to run.
 Open this Crack folder and inside you’ll see a game specific instructions on how to install the necessary files required to run COD Ghosts without any licensing issues. Follow the game-specific instructions on how to crack the game.


Depending on the COD: Ghosts version you download, the game may already pre-cracked. When this happens, this step becomes optional.
 Once you’re done, launch COD: Ghosts by clicking its shortcut icon on your desktop.

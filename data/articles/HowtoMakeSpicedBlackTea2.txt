 Measure and pour 7 cups (1.65 liters) of water into a large saucepan along with 1 cup (200 g) of sugar, 1 1-inch (2.5 cm) piece of peeled fresh ginger, 3 whole cloves, and 1 3-inch (7.5 cm) stick of cinnamon.You can also add 1 star anise, if you enjoy the flavor.
 Stir the spiced mixture and turn the heat to high. The mixture should begin to boil which will dissolve the sugar. Stir and boil the mixture for 1 minute. Turn off the heat and carefully pour the mixture through a fine sieve to strain out the solids. Pour the strained mixture back into the pan.You can discard the solids (the cloves, ginger, and cinnamon stick).
 Get out 4 black tea bags and add them to the saucepan with the hot mixture. Keep the heat turned off, but let the tea steep for 10 minutes before you take the bags out. You can stir the tea occasionally.Choose a strong, basic black tea (like Assam, English Breakfast, or Darjeeling). You may want to avoid flavored black teas because the spices might overwhelm the drink.
 Pour 1 cup (240 ml) of pomegranate juice and 1/4 cup (60 ml) of lemon juice into the spiced tea. Turn the heat back on to medium-high and heat the tea until it's hot again. You an serve the cinnamon-pomegranate spiced black tea with:Lemon slices
Cinnamon sticks

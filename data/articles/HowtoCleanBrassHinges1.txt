 There are two kinds of brass hinges: solid brass hinges, and hinges made of brass-plated steel, zinc, or cast iron. Place a magnet next to the brass hinge you’re interested in cleaning. If it sticks, you’ll know it is not made of solid brass.If the brass hinge you’re interested in cleaning is made of brass-plated zinc, cast iron, or steel, clean it very gently or the brass coating might come off.;
, Mix hot water with a few drops of liquid dish soap. There is no need to measure the volume of soap or water – just get the solution sudsy. Dip a warm sponge or cloth in the water and wipe the hinge down.After you’ve given it a thorough once-over, dip an old toothbrush in the water and clean any crevices or hard-to-reach places that you weren’t able to wipe down during your first cleaning.
 If your brass-plated hinges are unlacquered, you could wipe the hinge with an old toothbrush or rag dipped in ammonia if soapy water doesn’t do the trick. Rinse the hinges off in your sink beneath swiftly-flowing water. Dry with a clean, soft cloth.Do not use this method if your hinges are lacquered, as you will damage the coating.
To determine if your brass-plated hinges are lacquered, conduct a visual inspection. The lacquer forms a thin, clear shell over the brass-plated hinge.
Brass plate is almost always lacquered.

 Gather your hair in the back and brush it all behind you.
 As with all twist bump hairstyles, begin with a small lock of hair near your hairline. Twist three times, push forward to give it a slight poof, and pin this against your crown.
 Plait the rest of your hair into a classic French braid and secure it with a hair tie. Hairspray over the twisty bump when you're finished.

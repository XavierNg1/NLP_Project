 Creating a new text message varies depending on your phone model but is extremely easy to do using the messaging app.;
, On the text message field of the messaging app, type in the last four digits of the debit or credit card linked with your Orange account. Follow this with the amount you want to top up and your credit/debit card’s security code (e.g., 1234 10 123).
 Type 2886 on the recipient text field and press the Send button to confirm sending the message.


You’ll receive a text message a short moment after you’ve topped up, confirming that your account has been recharged with the amount you specified in the message.

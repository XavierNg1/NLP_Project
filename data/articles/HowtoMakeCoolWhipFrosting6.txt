 This step is key to producing a well-integrated strawberry flavor.


Place the stemmed strawberries into a food processor and pulse until the strawberries are liquified.
 In a medium bowl, combine the strawberry liquid and strawberry pudding mix.


Mix the two until theyâ€™re thoroughly combined.
 Once the strawberry liquid and pudding mix have been combined, gently fold in the whipped topping.


Continue combining until all of the ingredients are well-combined and a uniform color.
 Use a butter knife or spatula to spread the frosting, several tablespoons at a time, over the surface of the dessert.


Or, if you prefer, use a pastry bag (or plastic storage bag with a small hole in one corner) equipped with a frosting tip to frost your dessert.
You can use this frosting for cupcakes, shortcake, angel food cake, sheet cake, brownies, or refrigerator pies.

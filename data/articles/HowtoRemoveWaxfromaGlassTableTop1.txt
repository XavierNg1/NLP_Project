 While wax hardens and becomes difficult to remove after it dries, it can easily be melted again by applying heat. In its melted state, it will be much easier to remove.

While you can use a microwave or boiling water to melt wax off a glass plate or votive candle stick,youâ€™ll want to find an easier method for a table.
Use a hair dryer to heat up the wax until it becomes viscous.;
, Use a damp cloth or a soft sponge to wipe the wax off the table.

Use a flat, dragging motion instead of dabbing at the wax.
 Spray the area with glass cleaner and wipe it down with a lint-free cloth.

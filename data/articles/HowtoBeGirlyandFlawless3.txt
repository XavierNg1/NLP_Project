 Nobody wants to see chewed up food in your mouth. Close your mouth when eating and always ask for items that are far away from you instead of reaching across the table. Cover your mouth with your hands if someone speaks to you and you still have food in your mouth.
 People will think you're really nice and smart if you have good grades. Plus your parents might reward you!

, Never shout or yell because it will make you look mean and people will try to avoid you because of your harsh voice!

, If your little siblings do something you might not like, they are younger than you, just let them be!

, People will love your great personality and may want to start a new friendship with you! If you notice someone sitting alone at lunch don't hesitate to ask them to sit with your group of friends however, respect their decision if they decline your offer.

, Clean your rim thoroughly.
 The clock should be cheap, and should ideally have long hands. However, we will be making hand extensions, so if you cannot find a clock with long hands, do not worry.
 Carefully remove the hands.
 This will be used for the hand extensions.


Measure the radius of the bicycle rim and cut hand extensions for the clock accordingly. Generally, the hour hand should be about 6 inches (15.2 cm), and the minute hand will be 8 inches (20.3 cm). Paint them if you would prefer a different color.
 Allow to dry. Use only superglue, do not use a heavy adhesive. Using a heavy glue may mess up the clock's mechanism.
 (optional)


Place the hands back on the center of the rim.
 You can hot glue it but keep in mind if your surroundings becomes warm this is not advised. You can use industrial glue for durability.

Put in batteries and adjust the time. You should still be able to adjust the time as you would normally on the clock.

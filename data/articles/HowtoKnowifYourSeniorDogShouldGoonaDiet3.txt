 Whether or not your dog is a senior depends on their breed and body weight. Larger breeds tend to age faster than smaller breeds, and most dogs are considered senior when they are between the ages of five and 10 years old. Overweight dogs will often age quicker than dogs whose weight is within a normal range., As your dog gets older, you may need to adjust the type and amount of foods he eats. Limited mobility may cause an increase in weight, and an aging dog is more likely to encounter health problems than a younger dog.
 Dogs that are overweight are more likely to develop health problems. As such, it is likely you will need to put your overweight dog on a diet. Take your dog to a veterinarian to determine if they are overweight, as the vet is qualified to make such a determination., If your dog has a health problem such as heart disease, diabetes, or liver disease, they will need to go on a special diet. Make an appointment with your veterinarian for a check-up. The vet will be able to determine if your dog has a health condition that necessitates dietary intervention.Conditions that may lead to your dog being overweight include arthritis, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), Cushing's disease (overactive adrenal gland), non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, pituitary gland diseases, and insulinoma (a tumor in the pancreas). Tell your vet about any new or unusual behavior in your dog (such as drinking and/or urinating more frequently, increased or decreased energy, change in appetite, etc.).
Blood tests, radiographs, and ultrasounds may be necessary to check your dog for an underlying condition.

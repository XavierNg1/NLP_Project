 Leather isnâ€™t made to be ironed, and ironing it poses inherent threat of damage. Help mitigate this by turning your iron to its lowest setting before bringing it in contact with leather.Empty the steam well from your iron before you begin, as well. This helps avoid spilling and potential water damage.
 Get a heavy, brown paper or a 100 percent cotton cloth, such as a towel, and place it on top of the leather surface. Do not use lighter papers or fabrics, as the cover will burn in direct contact with the heated iron.Make sure the covering is clean and dry. Wipe any paper off with a towel before use.
 Iron your leather quickly and with a light hand. Do not hold the iron or move it slowly across the leather, even in stubborn areas. This may cause the leather to burn and could leave permanent damage.


Never put the iron directly on leather. Move the covering as necessary for larger items or deeper wrinkles.
Store or hang your leather item immediately after ironing if you do not intend on using it right away.

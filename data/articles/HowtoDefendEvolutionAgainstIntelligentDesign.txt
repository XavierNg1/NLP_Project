 Evolution does not state that humans evolved from monkeys anymore than monkeys evolved from humans. Instead, humans and monkeys share a common ancestor who lived millions of years ago. Humans and apes have been shown to have many similarities both in their appearance, genes, and behavior. When parents have children, they pass on unique genes to their children. Sometimes, genes also mutate (a flaw in the DNA occurs during replication or translation). Evolution can occur because of natural selection, whereby animals with mutations that enable it to survive in its environment are able to reproduce, and animals that are unable to survive are unable to reproduce., Fossils found further down the rock layers appear to be simpler specimens of fossilized organisms near the surface. Reveal that the fossil record shows a gradual specialization of organisms.For example, the fish Eusthenopteron shares so many characteristics with the amphibian Icthyostega that there logically is a connection between the two.
 In fact, an intelligent designer (like a human) aims for the simplest work that functions.For example, the laryngeal nerve in a giraffe has an illogical pathway which makes a big long loop instead of directly connecting where it should which would shorten the nerve significantly. In addition, major changes in the species composition of Earth as a result of mass extinctions do not support the idea that intelligent design made all creations perfect to live on Earth. , A theory is not a hypothesis, as many people assume, but it is rather an accumulation of observable facts and evidence that support a larger idea. Theories, in fact, only become accepted once they stand up to considerable scrutiny from the overall scientific community.

 Make sure the fabric is evenly stretched, neither too tight nor too loose. If it's too loose, it will sag and the dye will make puddles. Making it too tight may damage the fabric.;
, Wet down the silk with this solution (it will later allow the dye to spread and dry with a soft edge). It also allows more time to paint as it slows down the drying time. This is called the Wet-on-Wet technique.
 In this example, red is the primary color and a simple striped pattern is used for the background. Notice how the lines have a soft, fuzzy edge to them.
 In general, always start with light shades then move on to darker colors. Since the colors in silk painting are transparent, once you go dark, it's hard to go back to light. If you want white spaces, then you should leave the silk without any color.
 You may notice some of the colors separating (shown by the presence of an orange shadow or halo next to the red in this example, even though only various shades of red were used). This happens to some colors especially when working with the Wet-on-Wet technique.
 This is called Line Building or Wet-on-Dry technique. These lines will dry with a hard edge and if the application is a bit darker in color, it will also have a dark outline around it.
, You can also add salt to the silk as you spray to achieve a more mottled texture, as shown.
 The dye that is applied over a previously salted layer will still react with the salt and create neat swirly designs and jagged edges.

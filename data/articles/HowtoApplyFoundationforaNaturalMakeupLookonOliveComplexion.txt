 Is your skin a little more on the dark side or the light side? Once you figure this out, it will be easier to choose the perfect colour of foundation.;
, If your skin is on the lighter side, choose a foundation that is on the lighter side, and opposite if your skin is dark.


Remember: It's always easier to make your facial makeup darker, but it's hard to make it lighter. If you aren't sure, go a little lighter than you're sure of.
 Using a brush for putting it on your face, and then using your hands to rub it in. If you want a more matte look, use a stippling brush for application, but for a natural look, a regular foundation brush will work just fine.
 I would recommend a transparent colour, but if your foundation colour is a little lighter than you would like, use a tinted powder, or add a little bronzer over it all.

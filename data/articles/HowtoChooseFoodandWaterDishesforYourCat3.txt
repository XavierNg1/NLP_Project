 In the wild, cats like to be able to see their surroundings while they eat. This allows them to detect threats or predators. You should mimic this in your home. To do so, place your cat’s bowls in an open part of the room. Stay away from placing food and water dishes in corners, as this could make your cat feel on edge.Depending on your cat’s feeding schedule, you can put the food bowl away in between feedings. Your cat’s water bowl, however, should be left out at all times.
If you’re worried about your cat’s dishes looking tacky or clashing with your décor, try hanging an art piece or tea towels above the bowls. This will make them look more like they belong in the room., Your cat’s food and water dishes need to be washed every day. Using hot water and soap, scrub the dishes to remove any food residue. Rinse the dishes with hot water, making sure you rinse off any remaining soap.


You can also clean your cat’s dishes by running them through the dishwasher on the hottest setting.Instead of using soap, you can also use equal parts baking soda, warm water, and salt to clean your cat’s bowls. Scrub the dishes in a circular motion using this mixture and then rinse them well., In addition to washing your cat’s food and water bowls daily, soaking them in a solution of one part bleach and one part water will help ensure your cat’s dishes stay germ-free. Emerge the dishes in this solution for about 10 minutes once a week. Rinse them well when you take them out of the solution.

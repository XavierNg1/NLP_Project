Measure a rectangle on the paper using the dimensions of 12 x 10cm (5 x 4").
Measure another rectangle on the paper using the dimensions of 12 x 8cm (5 x 3").;
, They are now your templates for cutting out the felt pieces., Use a different color of felt for each rectangle. Always pin from the corners, to make the most of the felt sheet.

The colors must be complementary.
 Follow the guidance of the template., Match the long sides but on the shorter sides, leave a gap at each end. Spread glue along one of the two gaps, at the end., Begin at the side you have placed glue on and simply roll up as firmly as possible., Hold the roll with your other hand, to prevent it from unraveling. Complete the roll and hold the glued portion in place with rubber bands for a short while, until it adheres properly and the roll won't unravel.

Place the rubber bands at even intervals down the roll, so that it dries evenly.
 Use a fabric marker to mark spaces of 2cm/ 3/4" along the roll. When done, use sharp fabric scissors to cut right through the roll at these marked points. The resulting portions are the felt beads., Repeat the above steps to make as many felt beads as you need four your project. You can now use the beads to make jewelry, such as necklaces, bracelets and anklets, or attach them to hair accessories, shoes and belts. These beads are also handy for general use in craft projects.

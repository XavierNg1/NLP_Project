 Be sure to write the address legibly in a dark ink. You will need to include your home address as well if you would like to receive anything back.

 When you send fan mail to Rihanna, you can include something that you would like for her to autograph. While there is no guarantee that you will receive an autograph in return, it doesn’t hurt to send something along.


You should include something Rihanna specific, like a photograph or a postcard with her image on it. Do not send something that is irreplaceable, like ticket stubs to one of her concerts, since you may not receive it back.
 This is your opportunity to address Rihanna and her staff with the reason why you wanted to send her fan mail. You should include whether you’ve ever met her before or attended one of her tours or publicity appearances.


Ask her a question about her upcoming tours or her charities, like the Clara Lionel Foundation.
You can send either a hand written or typed letter. You should always sign your name in ink even if you did type the letter. This makes it more personal and is professional.
 Your letter to Rihanna should be kind, and you should thank her for spending time reading your letter to her. If you have included something for her to sign, you should thank her in advance for her autograph.


For example, you could say something like "Thank you for taking the time to read this. I know you receive a lot of fan mail and it means a lot to me to know that you've taken time out of your busy life to read a letter from your fan."
If you've included something for her to sign you could add, "Thank you in advance for signing this photograph for me. I took this photo at your concert and I have copies of it hanging in my room. Having an autographed copy of this photograph would mean to world to me, so thank you!"

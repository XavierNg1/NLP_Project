 There may be restrictions in your area for open fires, especially if you live someplace with draught conditions. Before you begin, call the local fire department to make sure it's okay to burn your stump.
 It might be handy to use the chopped-up tree you just cut down as fuel to burn a fire on top of the stop. Lay out the wood on top of the stump. Surround the stump with more wood, so that the stump will be at the center of the fire.
 It will take several hours to burn the stump. Keep adding more wood so that the fire stays large and hot. Keep it burning for as long as it takes for the stump to alight and burn down to the ground.
 After the stump has burned, shovel the ash out of the hole and discard it.
 Replace the ash with loam or sawdust. Keep adding matter to the area when it sinks every few months.

 If blood sugar continues to decrease with accompanying symptoms of confusion and severe body weakness, you should get a glucagon injection.Glucagon is a hormone that stimulates the liver to release stored sugar into the bloodstream.
This remedy is also used if someone has already lost consciousness due to severe hypoglycemia.
Glucagon is generally sold in kits. 1 mg of glucagon is injected into the buttocks, arms or thighs. It can be injected intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC).
Follow instructions on the manufacturerâ€™s manual as terms of dosage may differ, or seek medical help.
It is important to train family members on how to give glucagon in emergency situations, as a prolonged hypoglycemic episode can lead to coma.



Take metoclopramide at 10mg orally to help reduce nausea and prevent vomiting.
 This injection will raise the blood sugar within 5-15 minutes.


The person is typically injected with 50 mls of 50% glucose. Also known as a Dextrose solution, these injections are generally administered by a medical professional via a catheter placed in a large central vein., The blood sugar level should continue to be checked every 15 minutes until it normalizes.


This can be performed with the glucometer.

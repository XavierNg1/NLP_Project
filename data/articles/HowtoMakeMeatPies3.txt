, Roll your pie crust around the rolling pin. Start from one edge and carefully wrap your crust around the pin. Transfer your crust to your pie dish by carefully unrolling it from your pin and laying it down into the dish.


Avoid stretching the pastry.
 Trim to about 1/2 inch beyond the edge of the pie plate and fold the extra pastry under to create a thicker crust on the rim.
 To assemble your pie, slowly pour the filling into the pastry-lined pie dish. Level it off and don't overfill your dish.
 Roll out an additional circle of dough or pastry and carefully place it over your pie. Pinch the edges of the bottom layer and top layer of dough together and create the knuckle-like pie edge ridges. Trim off any excess using a sharp knife.
 Use a sharp knife to cut some vents into the top crust to allow the steam to escape when cooking.


Brush the top of your crust with egg or melted butter. This will help keep the crust moist and prevent cracking.
 Place your pie onto an oven rack in the center of your oven and cook for about 45 minutes or until the top of the pie is golden brown.When your pie comes out of the oven, it will be hot! Make sure to let it cool on the countertop before serving.

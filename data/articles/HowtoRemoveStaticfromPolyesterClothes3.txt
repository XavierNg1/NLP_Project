 If you are at the office and your polyester garments are clinging to you, use a safety pin to remove the static buildup. Clip a safety pin inside the lining of your garment along the hem or a seam so you do not damage the clothing. The metal in the pin will act as a grounding device, which neutralizes the static charge in your clothes., If you have a wire coat hanger, you can use that to remove static cling. Simply rub the wire hanger over the affected area to break the charge. Like the safety pin, the metal hanger neutralizes the buildup of electrical ions on your clothing, removing the static cling.If you notice your garment as a buildup of static before putting it on, run a wire hanger over it to remove the charge., Lightly dampen a washcloth or your hands with water. Glide the washcloth or your damp hands over the garment. The water will neutralize the static charge and remove the cling.Plus, because polyester dries quickly, you wonâ€™t have damp clothes for too long., If you are out and about and your polyester garment has a static cling, look for a metal pole, pipe, or lamppost that you can safely reach. Simply hold onto the metal pole. The metal will help remove the static charge from your clothing., A humid environment can help reduce static cling and static shocks. A static charge can be dispelled more quickly when there are more water particles in the air to break it up. Buy a humidifier from your local pharmacy or department store to help eliminate static cling in your polyester garments.

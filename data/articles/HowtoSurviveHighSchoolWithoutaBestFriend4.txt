 Not everyone has a BFF. Sometimes there is a sense that everyone has a best friend, but that is not true. This message can give the sense that if you don't have a best friend, there is something wrong with you. The reality is that there may be many reasons you do not have a "best friend", but that is OK.


Some people have a variety of friends, none of which are extremely close, but are nonetheless supportive, fun, and meaningful.
Friendship takes time. If you have just moved to a new town, you will not suddenly be surrounded with friends. Friendship--whether BFF status or not--takes time. Again, that is not a reflection on you.

 Set a fresh, young coconut on a hard, flat surface in your kitchen. Hold it in place with one hand, and use a butcher knife to make cuts in a circular shape around its eye. The easiest way to do this is to strike the coconut, as you would with a machete, in the same place until a deep enough cut is made. Continue to do this until you've cut a circular lid that can be lifted away from the coconut.


Use a very sharp knife to do this job. A blunt knife could slip and cut your hand.
Another method for opening a coconut is to wrap the coconut in a kitchen towel and set it on a hard surface. Use a rolling pin or a hammer to strike the coconut in the middle, so that it cracks in half. If you use this method, drill a hole in the coconut first, drain out the coconut water, and set it aside.
 Smell the coconut and inspect the meat. If the coconut smells good and the meat looks moist and white, it's fine to use. Discard the coconut if it smells off or if the meat is dried out or discolored. , Pour it straight from the coconut into a blender.
 Use a spoon to scoop the meat from the inside of the coconut. Try to get every last bit of white meat from the walls of the coconut, and don't forget to scrape it off of the lid, too. The meat should have a texture similar to a dense melon and easily curl against the spoon. Place the scraped meat into the blender.
 Put a lid on the blender and pulse it on high until the coconut water and meat are fully combined and smooth. At this point you may either strain the solids from the coconut milk or leave them as part of the mixture. Since fresh coconut meat is soft, many enjoy it in a glass of coconut milk, the way some like orange juice with pulp mixed in.
 Pour the fresh coconut milk into a jar. Put a lid on the jar and keep the milk in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it.

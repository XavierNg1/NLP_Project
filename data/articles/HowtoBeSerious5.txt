 It is so easy in today's world to become focused on "me" that we often forget that one of the most rewarding and productive things we can do is to focus on the well-being of others.


When you are helpful to others, even in small, everyday ways, you will find that your overall sense of your own well being will greatly increase and your confidence in the tasks and goals you have before you will be much greater.
Greater confidence in yourself and your own abilities results in much higher personal productivity, and, in turn, will help you to become a more serious person.
 Get involved in local volunteer opportunities. In 2013 alone, over 62 million Americans engaged in some form of volunteer work. Do you have a soft spot for kids? For old folks? For animals? Maybe you'd like to help maintain trails at a local park, or feed the homeless in a soup kitchen. Volunteer opportunities abound everywhere, especially in urban centers.
Even a couple hours a week, or even a month, can help give you a sense of focus and purpose in your life. Volunteering not only makes you feel good about yourself, it connects you with others, increases your social skills, combats depression, and helps keep you healthy., When you do to others as you would have done to yourself, you create a loop of goodwill. This isn't just for morality's sake; the more you show goodwill to others, the more likely they will be to contribute to your own advancement.

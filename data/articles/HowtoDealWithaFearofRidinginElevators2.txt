 When you are anxious, you might hyperventilate, which will only add to the severity of the situation. Breathing slowly and calmly will reduce negative physical sensations associated with your fear. Try the following before and during your elevator rides:Stand straight with one hand on your chest and one hand on your stomach.
Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds. The hand on your stomach should rise and the hand on your chest should stay relatively still.
Hold your breath for seven seconds. Release the breath for a count of 8 seconds. As you push the air out, the hand on your stomach should slowly move in towards you.
Repeat this process until you feel calm.
 Meditation allows your body to find a natural breathing rhythm, focus on the sensations of breathing in and out, and settle into an inner calm. Practice for 5 minutes every day in a non-stressful situation. After becoming familiar with meditation techniques, you can put them to use when you are feeling anxious inside an elevator., These are helpful when you are in a situation that makes you feel anxious, like being stuck in an elevator. Tell yourself a statement the likes of “I’ve been in this situation before and have come out of it okay” or “Statistically, riding in an elevator is very safe. And if I do have a panic attack, I can wait for it to pass. Next time I practice, I will feel less anxious.”, Your coping statement is already a distraction mechanism. You can also try getting your mind off of the fact that you’re riding an elevator by playing your favorite game on your phone, calling a friend (if there is service available), or counting backwards from 100 to 0.

 Don't bounce when stretching and perform each of the following specific order for best results.;
, To stretch in a straddle position spread your legs flat on the ground and pull down. Pull do the left, right and down to the middle as far as you can.
 Here you bring your legs together (flat on the ground) and pull down as far as you can.
 Bring your feet together with your legs bent just as in the picture. You can either flex your legs slightly or pull down as the other stretches.
 These go hand in hand. For dog stretch, sit on your knees, with your hands on the ground and stick your butt in the air. This should stretch your shoulders. Seal stretch is where you push your hips to the ground with your hands in front.
 These stretches help stretch your back. Do three, one with good form, one with your legs as close to your hands as possible, and one more just to stretch. After each one, tuck and roll your back out.
 This is where you put one foot in front and one foot behind as if you were taking a big step. Then bend your front knee so that your shin is perpendicular to the ground and your knee is right above your ankle. Slide your back foot as far back as possible but keep your knee in the same spot to prevent knee complications and injuries that will keep you from doing gymnastics. Tuck your toes under so that only the toes and touching the ground and your heel isn't. Put your hands on either side of you. This stretches your hamstrings that help with splits.

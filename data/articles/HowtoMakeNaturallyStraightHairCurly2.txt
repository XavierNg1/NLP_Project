 Wash it just like you normally would but use about half as much conditioner as you normally use.Use a towel to dry off your hair – skip the blow-dryer for a minute. You want your hair to be damp while you're putting it up in the bobby pins. This way it will expand only once it is already in the pins and the style will stay for longer.
 Depending on how long your hair is, you may need to use several handfuls. Use a generous amount. After applying the mousse, squeeze your hair again with the towel from the ends up to your roots. Avoid rubbing it as this could make your hair get frizzy and difficult to deal with.
 Apply a root-lifter only to your roots. As you apply, remember the roots at the back of your head and the nape of your neck. You can apply thickening spray all over, just like hairspray.
 While you’re drying your hair, use your fingers to comb through it gently. You might need to use a brush eventually, but try to use it as little as possible to avoid making your hair too straight with the brush. Lightly using your fingers is the best option here.
 Starting at the bottom of your head, use your fingers to divide your hair into sections. Just before you curl each section, spray it with hairspray. Use two bobby pins to pin the curl to your head. Do the rest of the sections, pinning each curl securely in place before you move on.
 Once you have pinned up all your curls, blow dry your hair again to encourage it to stay in this style. Then, apply hairspray to your whole head once again. Let the curls cool down completely.
 Wait until the curls have completely cooled before you do this. Now tousle with your fingers, but definitely do not brush. The brush will undo all of your hard work. The less you play with your curls, the better. Spray with hairspray one final time. Your hair should be nice and curly. If you aren't satisfied with the results, try sleeping with the bobby pins in your hair.

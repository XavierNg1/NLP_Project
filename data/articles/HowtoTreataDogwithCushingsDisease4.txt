 Radiation therapy uses radiation (usually x-rays) to damage the DNA in cancer cells.Radiation therapy is recommended for pituitary-dependent Cushing’s disease, when the tumor has become so large that it’s pressing on the brain and causing neurologic signs (seizures). Fortunately, radiation therapy is very effective at treating pituitary tumors.If your dog has radiation therapy, its symptoms likely won’t disappear with treatment. However, because the radiation shrinks the tumor, your dog’s neurologic symptoms will improve.Your vet may recommend treatment with trilostane or mitotane for several months after radiation therapy., Iatrogenic Cushing’s disease develops when a dog is given corticosteroids for too long. If your dog has this type of Cushing’s disease, it will need to stop taking that steroid. However, stopping steroid treatment has to be gradual. Over time, your vet will decrease the steroid dosage until your dog is no longer on the drug.Your vet may want to perform monthly ACTH stimulation tests to determine when to stop the steroid treatment.Eventually, your dog’s pituitary and adrenal glands will start working normally again., Although trilostane and mitotane are the top two medications to treat canine Cushing’s disease, other medications are available. For example, ketoconazole, which is an antifungal medication, blocks cortisol production. It is recommended for dogs that either can’t tolerate or don’t respond to trilostane or mitotane. Ketoconazole is very expensive.Anipryl controls dopamine levels in the brain. When dopamine levels are high, the pituitary gland will stop sending ACTH to the adrenals. The overall effect will be decreased cortisol levels.These medications may be effective for your dog. Talk with your vet about using them to treat your dog’s Cushing’s disease.

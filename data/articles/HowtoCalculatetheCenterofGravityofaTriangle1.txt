 To find the midpoint, measure the side, and divide the length in half. Label the midpoint A.

For example, if one side of the triangle is 10 cm long, the midpoint will be at 5 cm, since 10/2=5{\displaystyle 10/2=5}.
;
, Measure the length of the side, and divide the length in half. Label the midpoint B.

For example, if the side of the triangle is 12 cm long, the midpoint will be at 6 cm, since 12/2=6{\displaystyle 12/2=6}.
 These two lines are the median of each side. A vertex is the point at which two sides of a triangle meet.
 This point is the triangleâ€™s center of gravity, also called the centroid, or center of mass. The center of gravity is where the three medians intersect, but since the medians only intersect in one point, you can use a shortcut and find the center of gravity by only finding the intersection of two medians.

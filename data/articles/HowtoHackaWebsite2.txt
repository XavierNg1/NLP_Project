 You will need to find a site that is vulnerable, due to an easily accessible admin login. Try searching Google for admin login.asp.
 Type admin as the username and use one of a number of different strings as the password. These can be any one of a number of different strings but a common example is 1’or’1’='1 or 2'='2.
 This is probably going to require a little trial and error.
 Eventually, you should be able to find a string that allows you admin access to a website, assuming the website is vulnerable to attack.

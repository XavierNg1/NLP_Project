 With the stereogram image in your hands, identify an item in the room that you can gaze at, such as a photo on the wall, a vase on a table, or a lamp. Even though you’re holding the stereogram, make sure to focus exclusively on the object that you’ve chosen.The object that you focus on doesn’t necessarily have to be right at eye level, but it’s best not to choose an item that’s too high or low. You should be able to look at it comfortably while standing.
Make sure that the item isn't too small either because it may be more difficult to focus on a smaller object. The easier it is to maintain your focus on the item, the better chance you'll have of seeing the stereogram image.
 While you’re still focusing on your chosen object, you should begin to lift the image until it eventually blocks the item. However, you should still keep your focus on the object, not the stereogram. If you find yourself switching your focus to the stereogram, start the process over again.When the stereogram is blocking the object that you're focusing on, you should be trying to look "through" it. That will keep you from focusing on the stereogram, so your eyes are ready to see the 3D image.
 While still holding the stereogram so it blocks the object, move closer and further away from it to try a variety of distances. At the right distance, if you keep your gaze focused on the object, the hidden image in the stereogram will appear.The hidden image will likely be blurry at first. Continue looking at it at the same distance until the image eventually becomes sharp and clear.

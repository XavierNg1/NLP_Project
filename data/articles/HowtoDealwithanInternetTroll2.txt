 A troll's goal is to make users angry, and by responding to their posts, you are "feeding the troll". The sooner you extinguish the trolling, the better.
 Trolls will be thrown off balance if you give them a simple compliment, and may even stop trolling people. And keep it up!

, If the trolling persists, a moderator or site owner can deal with them.

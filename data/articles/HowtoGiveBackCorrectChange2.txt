 For example, if the total is $6, a customer might hand you $11 so that she can get back a single five dollar bill. On the other hand, if she handed you $10, she would have gotten back 4 one dollar bills.
 Especially for transaction not involving coins, it is usually simple to just count up.


For example, if the customer bought a $42 hat and gave you $47, you would count:
1 five dollar bill (“You gave me 42, plus 5 makes 47.”)

, It may not be immediately obvious how to get from $12.78 to $23.03. Here is where a little initial subtraction can simplify things:Start with the amount paid. Subtract from it to get a simpler number. In this case, 23.03 – .03 = $23.00.
Now subtract the same amount from the price: 12.78 – .03 = $12.75.
It's clear now that you'll need to first give back a quarter.
1 quarter takes you from $12.78 to $13.03. (“that’s $13.03”)
1 ten dollar bill (“plus 10 equals 23.03”)

, As another example of a more complex situation, imagine that you're a waiter and a customer is purchasing a meal worth $112.31. They give you 6 twenties, a nickel, and a penny.


Add the amount paid by counting up as you put the money down: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 and six cents. Tell the customer the amount paid: "$120.06".
The customer gave you a bizarre amount of change, so this might be a good time to do a bit of subtraction. 120.06 - .06 = $120.00, and 112.31 - .06 = $112.25. Better. You need 3 quarters.
Now start adding up from $112.31 to $120.06.
3 quarters ("takes us to 113.06") - We know this works from our earlier subtraction exercise.
2 one dollar bills ("114, 115")
1 five dollar bill ("and 5 is 120.06")
Check your work: You gave .25 + .25 + .25 + 1 + 1 + 5 = $7.75. $7.75 + $112.31 = $120.06 – the amount the customer paid.

 If you’ve accessed the textbook online, you need to indicate that via the citation. The first part of an online textbook citation looks identical to a print textbook citation. The only information you should leave off is the location and publisher information.


You need to list the URL where you accessed the textbook online at the end of the citation. The citation style is: Last, F. M. (Year Published). Book title. Retrieved from URL.
Example: James, H. (2009). The ambassadors. Retrieved from http://books.google.com.
For a textbook with software, include the software edition. Example: George, D., & Mallery, P. (2002). SPSS for Windows step by step: A simple guide and reference (4th ed., 11.0 Update). Pearson Allyn & Bacon.
 If there is a doi number for the online textbook (which is basically like a social security number for a book’s web location), you should write the citation with it.


Example: Rodriguez-Garcia, R., & White, E. M. (2005). Self-assessment in managing for results: Conducting self-assessment for development practitioners. doi: 10.1596/9780-82136148-1Doi numbers are usually found on the first page near the copyright or on the database landing site that you used to access the book.

 You will find 'map' option around the right corner of the game screen. Click on it.
 In the map, you will see many locations. Note that some of them are for moshi members only. Select 'sludge street', and you'll land right there!, Scroll to the right as shown in the picture until you see a wooden building called 'Dodgy Dealz', Click on 'Dodgy Dealz' and you'll automatically enter the building., You can only sell items when they are in your inventory. Your inventory is in the 'treasure chest' underneath your 'map' option. Drag the unwanted item to the big brown box in the shop., Two cards should appear, with options on them. They are: 'SELL FOR 40%' (where you will get 40% of the original price) or 'TAKE A CHANCE' (Where you will be given a choice of 10 cards, from 10% to 100%). Select either of the two cards.







If you select the 'TAKE A CHANCE' card, select any of the 10 cards that will be randomly scattered on the board. Just be careful that you don't end up with only 10% the original price! You'll get your rox straight after the deal. If you want to sell more items, repeat step 5 and step 6 of this article. The more items you need to sell, the more number of times you have to repeat the last two steps.

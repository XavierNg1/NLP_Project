 No matter how tempting it is, do not answer that question with a yes or no.;
, Responding with a big, cheesy smile and, "You're a beautiful girl. And that's all I'm saying". will usually bring smiles and further questioning. Like, "Aww, come on - would I be your type?" etc.
 Stick with your story. Explain that telling the truth, in this case, might actually harm your friendship and no lesbian ever answers this question from a straight girlfriend. When she persists and ask why, tell her:


"If I say I am attracted to you, you might be flattered today, but you may feel creepy about it tomorrow. After that, forever, you may give unwanted meaning to every little touch, every bit of eye contact - everything. Eventually, it would eat away at our friendship, because you wouldn't trust that things I say or do are in the interest of our friendship rather than in my self-interest as I try to lure you into my nefarious clutches. So I'm not going to say that".
"If I say I am attracted to you, you might decide to indulge in a little experimentation. That wouldn't be fair to either of us, because if I actually developed romantic feelings for you because of a little so-called 'harmless hookup', it would hurt me if you dumped me to be with someone else. So I'm not going to say that."
"If I say I am not attracted to you, it might insult you, or make you feel that I like you less. In the end, it'll make you feel bitter about me. So I'm not going to say that."
"No matter how I answer, this will not end well for me or for our friendship. So I will only ever answer this question with, "You are a beautiful girl, and I love you - as a friend. Period."
Simply ask back "Are you attracted to every guy around you? Obviously not. That's same for anyone regardless of their sexual orientation."

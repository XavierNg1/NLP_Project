 The characters in Snow White are iconic in our culture, and these make it easy to include others in a group costume. You might suggest to your friends to join you dressed as:


The huntsman
Prince Charming
One of the seven dwarfs
The Queen or her alter ego, the Crone
The Magic Mirror

, If you don't have any friends that want to join you in your fairy-tale adventures, you can still include your favorite dwarf in your costume. Take an old doll (or buy a new one), make a costume out of felt or cloth in the fashion of your chosen dwarf, dress it up and take it along with you wherever you go.


For example, if you wanted Dopey to be your companion while dressed as Snow White, you might make an overly large, robe-shaped outfit for your doll. Add a purple stocking cap to complete this simple costume.
 Snow White is depicted as so gentle and kind that when she reaches a cottage in the forest, she has already won over the forest creatures.You might want to use a hair clip to attach a fake bird to your shoulder to give this effect.
 Many of the princesses of the Disney universe are beloved characters, well known in pop-culture. You might consider doing a Disney princesses themed group costume with your friends! Some princesses to consider:


Alice (Alice in Wonderland)
Belle (Beauty and the Beast)
Cinderella (Cinderella)
Jasmine (Aladdin), You can create conversation pieces and further get into character by adding other elements of the story to your costume. You could take a hand mirror and draw a crack on it with an erasable marker and bring this with you wherever you go. When people ask you about it, you could say:


"This is the magic mirror that the wicked Queen used, but it broke when she died."

, Though you may remember most of the story from seeing the movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as a child. But if you haven't seen it in a while, you may want to make sure you remember everything correctly. Attention to detail will give more depth to your costume.

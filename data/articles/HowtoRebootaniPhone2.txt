 This should be the computer that you last performed a sync (or backup) to, so that you can hopefully restore most of your data.
 When your device connects, an "iPhone" button will pop up on the left side or top-right corner (depending on what version of iTunes you have) for you to access your phone's settings. Click on this button. Click on the "Summary" tab on the top horizontal navigation bar.
 Your iPhone may have automatically started backing up when it connected to your computer, and if that's the case, just wait for the backup to complete. If your iPhone is seriously damaged, this may not recover any additional data, but it's worth attempting.
 Tap the "Settings" app on your iPhone. Tap "General," and then "Reset." On the next screen, choose "Erase All Content and Settings."


Wait until the factory reset completes. This may take up to an hour.
Make sure your phone works after resetting. If it's still glitchy, take it into the Apple Store for inspection.
 With your iPhone connected via USB, right-click on the device name in iTunes and select "Restore from Backup." You can then select which backup you'd like to restore to.


Alternatively, click the "Restore" button on the Summary page on iTunes.
It's possible that an app or piece of data in your last backup is causing the glitch. If your phone is glitching again after restoring the backup, try restoring to an earlier backup. If you still experience problems, perform the factory reset but do not restore any backup, or consult an Apple Genius Bar employee.

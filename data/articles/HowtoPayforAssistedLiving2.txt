 If you own your own home, and your spouse plans to still live there while you are in assisted living, you may want to consider doing a reverse mortgage.

The bank will determine a value based on the homeâ€™s worth, interest rates, your age, and other factors. Once your spouse or another family member is gone from the home, you will need to repay the bank. Often, this means selling the home.This option is good if you are not planning to keep the home in the family or pass it down to other family. You must be over the age of 62 to apply for a reverse mortgage and have one person still living in the home.
Work with a reputable insurance company to complete the reverse mortgage as it is a big financial commitment. Discuss the fine print attached to the reverse mortgage and be wary of high fees or clauses that may make it easy for you to lose your home.

Hire a property manager to take care of the home for you or have a family member maintain the home for the renters.

 Mossdeep City is on an island along the eastern edge of Hoenn, near Shoal Cave, on Route 125.;
, Once you have reached Mossdeep City, you need to defeat the gym leader first, if you haven't done that yet.


Gym leaders Tate and Liza uses psychic-type Pokémon, so make sure to use Pokémon that are great against psychics.
The best option to defeat the double gym leader is to use Absol. You can find this wild Pokémon on Route 120, though you only have a 7–10% chance of finding one. Needless to say, this Pokémon learns Bite at level 28, which is very much effective against psychics.
Another Pokémon to use in this fight would be a dark type such as Mightyena; this Pokémon can be found on the route west of Lilycove City.
You will obtain a badge, and this will trigger an event in the Space Center.
 Team Magma has sent a letter to the Space Center informing them that they will be stealing their rocket fuel. By the time you earn the Mind Badge at Mossdeep Gym, Team Magma will attack the center—it's your job to stop them.
, On the second floor of the Space Center, you get to meet Steven Stone and will pair up to double battle against Maxie and Tabitha.


Maxie and Tabitha will be using Mightyena, Crobat, and Camerupt.
 After defeating Team Magma and saving the Mossdeep Space Center, go back to the Mossdeep City and enter Steven's house.
 Steven will thank you for what you've done. As a token of appreciation, he will give you HM Dive.

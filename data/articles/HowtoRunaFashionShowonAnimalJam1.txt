 First you must prepare your den. Make sure to have lots of space in it, as there are often a lot of people to come.;
, Shout out "Fashion show at my den!". If your fashion show includes a prize like most fashion shows, then you will want to add "Includes rare!", or you can say specific prizes like "Includes rare!", "Includes rare item Monday!", or anything else related.
 Tell everyone to take a seat and spread out. If you want, put mats, pillows, couches, or maybe even plaid sofas or heart couches under the people once they are done sitting down. If you want, the fashion show can take place outdoors if the outside has more space than the interior.
 Usually these start off with "Most like..." and so on. If wanted, make your themes unique and like "Most like me " or maybe even "Most like (your favorite TV show)!" or anything which relates to that.
 To do this, yell out in caps "(animal name/username) is out!". That person has to sit out on the fashion show. If you want, let them dress up with the themes, but just don't include them in the current game (example, if they are out they can not win to first place or lower even).
 Reward them with a nice prize that they would like. Maybe even put out some prizes and let them choose what they want out of them!

 Click “Clear History” at the bottom of the menu. A box will open asking you to confirm if you want to clear your history, and what dates you want to delete.
 If you’d rather delete specific history entries, click the History menu and select Show All History. From here, you can select individual entries and delete them as you see fit.
 If you know you are going to be doing something online that you don’t want to leave a record of, browse with a Private Browsing window to prevent Safari from logging your browsing history for that session. To start a Private Browsing session, click the Safari menu or the gear icon and select “Private Browsing”., To delete your iPad browsing history, open the Settings from the Home screen. Select Safari from the left navigation menu and then tap Clear History. You will be asked for confirmation before the entries are deleted.

 This person might be someone who only advises you on the finances or someone who pitches in and does everything with you. This is up to you, but it can make life a lot easier than doing it all alone.


If you can't afford to pay this person (or yourself for that matter), promise in writing a share of the profits once they materialize.
 You will want people who can drive the vehicle and then stand in it all day selling cupcakes and handling money. They would have to work in cramped conditions for whatever hours you need them.
 This should include a slight overlap between one employee and the next.

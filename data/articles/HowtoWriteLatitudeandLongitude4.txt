 Degrees of latitude and longitude are often broken down by decimals. Rather than minutes and seconds, lines representing one degree are divided to get decimals pinpointing the exact location. First, find the right degrees of latitude and longitude.For example, say your location falls at 15째N, 30째W.
 An online map can break down lines of latitude and longitude using decimal points. Usually, decimal points are made up of five numbers.For example, your location could be 15.23456 north and 30.67890 west.
 Rather than using the words north, south, east, and west to indicate direction, positive or negative numbers are used. For lines of latitude, lines north of the equator are positive while lines south of the equator are negative. For lines of longitude, lines east of the Prime Meridian are positive while lines west of the Prime Meridian are negative.For example, the line of latitude 15.23456 would be north of the equator, while the line -15.23456 would fall south of the equator.
A line of longitude written out 30.67890 would fall east of the equator, while the line -30.67890 would fall west.
 It's simple to use the decimal degrees. You simply write out the line of latitude, including decimals, followed by the line of longitude, including decimals. Use positive or negative numbers to indicate direction.For example, say a line falls 15째N, 30째W. Using the decimal degree system, you could write this as "15.23456, -30.67890."

The Horde races include Undead, Troll, Orc and Tauren. You can also choose the Blood Elf race if you have the Burning Crusade faction. You can choose the Goblin race after purchasing the Cataclysm expansion pack. You may also choose to be a Pandaren and side with the horde.
The races aligned with the Alliance faction are Human, Night Elf, Dwarf and Gnome. You can be a Draenei if you have Burning Crusade or pick the Worgen race after purchasing the Cataclysm expansion. You may also choose to be a Pandaren and side with the Alliance.;

Once chosen, your character's class is the only aspect you cannot change, with or without a fee. All classes are available to at least 2 or 3 races in each faction and you have a much greater selection of races for your chosen class as you add expansion packs to the game.
Every race can choose to be a warrior or death knight, while shaman, druids and paladins have fewer races from which they can pick.



Some racial bonuses are especially good for player-versus-player (PvP) combat, like the Undead's "Will of the Forsaken," while others benefit player-versus-environment (PvE) play, like the Human's reputation gain from the "Diplomacy" racial bonus.
Passive racial bonuses may include extra skills with certain weapons or professions, while active bonuses provide a special ability that is useful in combat.



Many players gravitate toward a certain type of role-playing (RP) character. For instance, Night Elves are an Alliance race and are reclusive and slightly xenophobic, while Orcs are an honorable and brutal Horde race.
Race may be more important to you than class if you will be role-playing your character on an RP server.

 If you get to pick your own set of ribs, you’re very lucky. It should be an intuitive choice: look for the ribs that best reflect your ideal. This means that if you’re extremely hungry, and there’s plenty of ribs, it’s good to go for a big set. If you like plenty of sauce, look for that. If you don’t need a ton of sauce, then save the really saucy ribs for your friends who do.
 Using a table knife, seperate one of the rib bones from its fellows. This should not require a ton of force: rib meat is tender, so gentle sawing should do the trick. If the ribs are tender enough, you should even be able to tear the rib away, instead of cutting it., Hold the seperated above your plate in case anything drops from it. Use your index finger, middle finger, and thumb to hold each end. This should keep it fairly stable, and ensure you at least a couple clean fingers. Don’t stick your pinkies in the air, because that looks silly., If you bite into the middle of the rib at first, the meat at both ends might fall off, and then you’ll have to eat the meat scraps with your fingers off your plate. Avoid this indignity by picking one end of the rib to begin with, and then biting progressively to the other side., There are several reasons to take small bites and chew methodically. One is that ribs are a choking hazard--taking huge bites might mean you swallow a bone by mistake. Another is that ribs are served on social occasions. You’ll want to be able to talk and bond with the people you’re eating with. Furthermore, ribs are a wonderful treat, and they should be savored. Finally, if you eat carefully, you probably won’t end up terribly messy!

 Choppers can be found all around the city—on airports, hospitals, and building helipads. When you find a chopping, approach it and press the Y button on your Xbox 360 controller. This will have your character board the chopper.
 To lift off from the ground, press and hold the Right Trigger (LT) button on the topside of the controller to take off. Keep pressing this button until you reach your desired altitude.
 While in midair (and while still pressing the Right Trigger button), use the left analog stick to go forward or backward, left or right, towards the direction where you want to go.
 If you want to make a sudden left or right turn, press the Left Bumper (LB) or Right Bumper (RB) buttons respectively, and your chopper will make a sharp corner turn.
 If the helicopter you’re flying has built-in weapons (such as military helicopters), you can shoot missiles or fire guns by pressing the A button.
 To switch between the first, second, or third camera views while in midair, simply press the right analog stick.
 Once you’ve arrived at your destination, press and hold the Left Trigger (LT) button to slowly descend. Use the left analog stick while the chopper is descending to help you steer to your desired landing spot.

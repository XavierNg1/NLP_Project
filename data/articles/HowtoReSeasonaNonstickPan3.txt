 If you aren’t confident that your pan is oven-safe, you can also season a pan on the stovetop. Begin by heating the clean, dry pan on medium heat for 3 minutes., Once the pan has heated for 3 minutes, add 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) of coconut oil to the pan and wait for it to melt, about 2 minutes.You can also use vegetable oil if you prefer or don’t have access to coconut oil.
 Once the coconut oil has melted, pick the pan up off the stove and roll your wrist to tilt it around in a circular motion. This should swirl the oil around in the bottom of the pan so that it coats the entire bottom., After swirling the oil, place the pan back down on the burner. Let the pan sit over the heat until the coconut oil begins to smoke. This means that the oil is getting hot and is starting to bake into pan., When you start seeing the oil smoke, take the non-stick pan off the heat and set it aside to cool. Keep the oil inside the pan and let the pan cool until it is room temperature., Once the pan cools, you should still see some coconut oil coating the bottom. Take a paper towel and gently rub the oil into the pan. The rubbing should force some coconut oil into the pores of the pan, while absorbing the excess with the paper towel. Your pan is seasoned and should be ready to use.

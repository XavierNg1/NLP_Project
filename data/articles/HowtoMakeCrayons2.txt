 You can buy beeswax online or at craft stores, usually in 1 lb blocks. Use a plain white bar of soap for this project. You will need equal amounts of beeswax and soap. To make your crayons you will need the following:1 part beeswax
1 part soap
Liquid food dye
A microwave safe container, or double boiler
A cheese grater
A knife
A mold, such as a silicone ice stick tray or muffin pan
Non-stick spray or shortening

, Chop the beeswax into manageable pieces to help it melt faster. Use a cheese grater to grate the soap., Place the chopped beeswax and the grated soap into a microwave safe container. Put the container in the microwave and melt the soap and wax together. Heat the mixture in one minute intervals and watch it closely. Make sure the mixture doesn't foam. Foam will add air bubbles to your crayons.You can also melt the soap and wax in a double boiler. Get a medium sized stock pot and fill it with water. Put the pot onto a burner over high heat and bring the water to a boil. Put the soap and beeswax into a smaller saucepan and place it on top of the pot of boiling water. Stir constantly and make sure the mixture does not foam over.If you do get air bubbles, let the mixture sit for a few minutes. Gently stir to remove any bubbles., Once you have melted the beeswax and the soap, you can add your liquid food color. The more color you add, the more vibrant your crayons will be.If you want to make multiple colors, divide the hot wax and soap mixture into equal parts. Add different colors to each portion., Spray your molds with non-stick spray or grease them lightly with shortening. You can use silicone trays, muffin pans, or even make your own molds out of foil paper or clay.Pour the wax mixture into your molds and let them harden. It could take a few days for the crayons to set completely.

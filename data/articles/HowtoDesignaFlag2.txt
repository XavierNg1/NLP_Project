 When you are designing a flag it is very important that you choose colors and images that symbolize the organization or place your flag represents. For instance, you may be designing a flag for a micronation, fictional land, club, organization, or charity. Keep this in mind when you are adding symbolism to your flag.


For example, if you are creating a flag for a fishing club, you may want to use a fishing rod, boat, or fish as a symbol. The color blue could also be used to represent water.
 When you are selecting which colors to include on your flag, make sure the colors have some sort of symbolic meaning. For example, if your location is near water, you may want to include blue in your flag to symbolize the water. Consider some of the meanings associated with popular flag colors:Black: determination, ethnic heritage, bravery, and/or defeating one's enemies.
Blue: freedom, vigilance, perseverance, loyalty, justice, prosperity, peace, patriotism, water.
Green: the Earth, agriculture, luck, and/or fertility.
Red: courage, communism, revolution, hardiness, blood, and/or valor.
White: peace, purity, snow, and/or innocence.
Yellow: the sun, wealth, and/or justice.
Pink-: Feminism
Gray: selflessness

, Images and symbols can be used to help distinguish your flag from others, and will communicate the purpose or meaning behind the flag. The image of an eagle could symbolize freedom or power, a star could stand for divinity or honor, and a circle could represent the sun.The Japanese flag, for instance, has a plain white background with a red circle in the middle. This represents the sun, which is an important symbol in Japanese culture.

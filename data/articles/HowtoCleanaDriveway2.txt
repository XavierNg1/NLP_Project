 Cat litter, corn starch, cornmeal, or baking soda be used to remove oil and gasoline from your driveway. Cover the stain with one of these products and allow it to sit for at least an hour. If the stain was wet when you applied the absorbent, the absorbent will soak up the oil or gasoline. Use a broom to sweep up the absorbent.If the stain was dry when you applied the absorbent, wet the stain with water and scrub it with a stiff brush and a paste (i.e. 3 parts baking soda to 1 part water). Then rinse the area with water and let it air dry.
You may have to repeat this process more than once.
 Pour two cans of room temperature cola on the stain and let it sit overnight. Blot the stain with a towel in the morning and rinse the stain with water.It is best to rinse the area with a hose so that you can apply pressure to the area.


You can also scrub the cola into the stain with a stiff brush.
If you cannot let the cola sit overnight, let it soak for at least an hour before you spray the area with water., Wet the area with the stain and sprinkle dish-washing detergent (i.e. powdered detergent) all over. Make sure the area is completely covered with detergent. While the detergent is sitting on the stain, boil a large pot of water. Once the water begins to boil, pour it over the stain and scrub it with a stiff-bristled brush. Rinse the area with water once you are finished.You can use baking soda instead of dish-washing detergent.
Repeat this process as many times as you need to.

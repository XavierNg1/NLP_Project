 Get the bleeding victim to hospital as quickly as possible. Internal bleeding cannot be treated at home and can only be dealt with by a doctor.
 Keep the victim calm, resting comfortably, and prevent further injury. Don't stress movement, and remain laying down if you're able.
 Monitor the victim's airway, breathing and circulation. If there is any, attend to external bleeding.
 Keep from getting too hot or too cold by applying rags dipped in water and placed over the forehead.

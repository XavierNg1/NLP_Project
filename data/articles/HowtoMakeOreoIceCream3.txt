 Pour 2 cups of cold heavy cream or whipping cream into a large bowl and mix it using an electric mixer. Blend it for about 3 minutes, or until peaks form and the cream is stiff.


If you do not have an electric mixer, you can use a food processor with a whisk attachment.
 Stir in 1 can (or 14 ounces) of cold, sweetened condensed milk into your whipped cream. If you wish to add some vanilla flavoring, you can add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and stir it until you achieve a uniform color.
 You will need about â…” cups of crushed Oreo cookies. The crushed pieces can be as large or as small as you want them to be, but overall, pieces should be no larger than your thumbnail. You can even have a combination of large and small pieces.Consider crushing the cookies in smaller batches of 5-10 cookies at a time, as opposed to all at once. You can crush or crumble your cookies in various ways:


Place some cookies into a blender or food processor and blend them for a few seconds. You can get some finely-ground up cookies.
Chop up whole cookies into smaller pieces with a knife. This will give you some larger and smaller chunks.
Place the cookies into a large, resealable bag, and smash them by hitting them with a mallet, or going over them with a rolling pin.
Crumble the cookies with your fingers. This will leave you with mostly large chunks.
 Using a spatula, fold the crumbled cookies into the mixture.Keep folding and stirring until the cookie bits are spread throughout the mixture. You want an even consistency.
 Transfer the mixture into a freezer-safe container and put it into the freezer. Let it freeze for at least 6 hours.,

 Your parents are likely to have concerns about how having a lip ring might affect your health. They will appreciate it if you’re up-front and open about the matter, which will show them that you’re not hiding anything.


Highlight the low risk of infection,hepatitis, and nerve damage as the main concerns.Emphasize that these complications can be prevented by using a certified, licensed piercer,ensuring you have the proper immunizations for tetanus and hepatitis B,and by regularly cleaning the ring and the piercing., Mention that noticeable swelling is an expected aftereffect of a lip piercing, and that to make room for the enlarged area, a longer-than-usual piercing called a post is put in place until the swelling goes down. But add that while the larger post can cause gum damage, its potential to do so is limited since it will be replaced by a regular-size piercing after the swelling goes away in six to eight weeks.Try to play down the change in appearance by observing: "It won't look or feel much different from a fat lip after a sports accident, or a mouth sore."

, If your parents say that they’ve heard that lip piercings can damage your teeth by chipping them, point out that it is actually tongue piercings that cause the most tooth chipping.While there may be a slight risk of tooth damage while eating, depending on the type of lip ring you wear, you can calm any concerns your parents may have by agreeing to remove your ring before meals once the piercing has healed.


You can reassure them by pledging something like, "I'll get in the routine of taking out the ring by making notes for myself as reminders."

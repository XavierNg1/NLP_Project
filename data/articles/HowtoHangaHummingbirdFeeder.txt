 The majority of hummingbird feeders come with a J-hook from which to hang them; however, some are meant to be screwed onto the railings of decks.;
, The feeder should be set up in a relatively shady place, with plenty of perches nearby. Make sure to account for your view when you chose a place for the feeder; it's a treat to watch these iridescent birds. Consider placing the feeder within view of a window. Because you'll need frequent access to it for cleaning and refilling, the location should be easily accessible, and not too tall for you to reach.
 Deck-type feeders will need to be secured to a flat, wooden surface with screws, whereas hanging feeders simply need their J-hook top hooked over a stable branch, or a hook on the eaves of your house.

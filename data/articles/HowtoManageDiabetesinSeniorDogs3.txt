 Many older dogs with diabetes need daily insulin injections. Insulin shots are usually given in the dog’s back by folding the dog’s skin and using a special syringe or a VetPen. You should hold the needle at a 45 degree angle in your dominant hand. Push the plunger down with your thumb as quickly as possible so as not to prolong your dog’s discomfort.When your vet prescribes insulin, they will show you the proper way to give your dog insulin injections. Use only the syringes supplied by your vet, and use them only as directed. Do not repeat an injection if you cannot tell whether the injection went in.
Rather than injecting the same spot repeatedly, which may cause pain for your dog, vary the injection site a little every day.
 Often, vets will instruct you to check your dog’s glucose levels so you can monitor their condition. This is generally done using a glucose meter or a dipstick provided by your vet. You should use the meter or dipstick to check your dog's urine on a daily basis.When you check your dog’s glucose level using the provided meter, you will have to prick the dog’s skin on a hairless area to get a drop of blood.
The urine dipstick helps monitor your dog for glucose levels as well as conditions like ketosis. If ketones appear on the dipstick after testing, consult your vet immediately for advice.
Log the dog’s glucose level so you can discuss it with your vet, and schedule an immediate vet visit if your dog shows any signs of an illness that can destabilize a diabetic pet, such as a stomach ache, a sore mouth, or an ear infection.
 Dogs with diabetes can get too much insulin, which can lead to complications. If your dog’s insulin levels are too high, your vet may need to adjust the injections. If you notice any signs of too much insulin, take you dog to the vet. Symptoms include:Shaking
Unsteady gait
Lethargy
Falling
Seizures

 Blackcurrants are very frost tolerant and need cold winters to grow their best.;
, They can grow with some shade but prefer full sun.
 Blackcurrants feed well and need a nutritious soil. Till the soil and add blood and bone or potash and nitrogen in the early spring.


The soil needs to be well-drained, light, and kept moist.
Blackcurrants are more forgiving on less nutritious soil than other berries but produce the best fruit when well fed.
 Fruit is borne on the length of the previous year's spring growth, by sending up shoots from under the round yearly. When planting, bury the blackcurrant stem about 5 centimeter (2.0Â in) deeper than it was positioned in the container you purchased it in.
 Don't pick the blackcurrants too soon. Once ripened, leave the berries to hang on the bush a few extra days to improve the flavour. When you see some of the upper level berries fall off unaided, the blackcurrants are ready for harvesting.
 Each bush should carry around 6 to 10 shoots. Remove the oldest canes post-harvest yearly. This will stimulate the new growth.


Pruning off the oldest canes will renew the entire bush about every three years.

 Ideally, the color should match your teeth, but whitening toothpaste or other methods can blend most teeth in with a bright white, plastic straw.


This method is quick and easy, and the fangs are easily removed and reattached.
 If your straw is a bendy straw, cut off the top portion, right above the accordion bend. Otherwise, cut off about 2 inches (5 centimeters) with a pair of scissors. Or, stick the end of the straw over your tooth and look in a mirror to measure twice as long a piece as you need., Fold the cut-off piece of straw in half. Use the pair of scissors to trim to the two sides into fang shapes. Leave them attached while you trim them, so you can compare the shapes and keep them symmetrical.


Don't cut too close to the fold. That area of the straw will go over your tooth, and needs to be kept intact or the fang could fall apart.
 Cut the piece of straw in half along the fold, separating it into two fangs. Slip these onto your canines, or onto the incisors directly to either side of your large front teeth.

 Determine how big you want your composting area to be and dig holes at the four corners of that square area. Insert 2x4's of solid wood into the holes and fill the holes in with tightly packed soil. Fence in the area by building sides out of wood (preferably a weather-resistant wood such as redwood), leaving at least a 1/2 inch (approximately 1.25 cm) between the boards for aeration.


Your composting pile should be at least 3 ft by 3 ft by 3 ft (approximately 91 cm by 91 cm by 91 cm) for the decomposition process to take effect properly.A sealed compost bin can be placed inside the fenced in area, or a compost pile can be made directly inside of it.;
, Start building on bare soil to allow organisms like worms to aerate the compost. Make a bed of straw or twigs as a base (a few inches thick) to allow for drainage and air flow. Prepare covering for your compost pile, such a plastic sheeting or wood., Composting bins are used to collect and store compost ingredients in a secure and sanitary way. If you do not wish to build your own compost bin, purchase one from a hardware store or online. You can also contact your local government office to see if your municipality has a program in place to provide citizens with composting bins, or sell them to them.Choose between a stationery model and a tumbler, which will allow you to turn the composting materials easily.
 To prepare garden compost without unsightly bins or piles, dig a trench in your garden approximately 12 inches (approximately 30 cm) deep. Fill it halfway with your kitchen scraps, then cover the rest with soil. Trenches can be placed between plants, along shrub borders, or virtually anywhere else in the garden.Composting trenches should be moved to different locations in your garden every year.

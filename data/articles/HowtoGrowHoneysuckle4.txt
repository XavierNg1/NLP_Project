 Honeysuckle seeds are not available in every region, at every nursery, or through every seed catalogue. If you can not find a supplier and you have access to a honeysuckle plant, you may collect the seeds directly from the spent flowers.


Honeysuckle seeds are found in pods. When the pods become dry and brittle, they are ready for harvest. Ripe pods should snap off the stem and split a small amount when squeezed., After harvesting the pods, the wet seeds need to dry. Dry the seeds in a well ventilated room. The room should be kept at a temperature between 70 and 95â„‰. After two to six weeks, the seeds will be ready to plant.


You can dry the seeds in a closed paper bag, an open plastic cup, or a mixing bowl covered with a piece of screen, lightweight fabric, or cheesecloth., Fill a small container with moist perlite soil. Sprinkle or place the seeds on top of the soil. Water the seeds immediately. The seeds will germinate within fifteen days.


The seeds must be wet to germinate, or transform from a seed to a seedling. Check the soil every day to determine if the seeds need additional water.

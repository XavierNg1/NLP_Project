 Pretty much any building in Age of Empires, except for walls, offers up technologies to research.


Select a building and check out the buildingâ€™s command panel (which appears on the bottom left corner of the screen for AoE2 and earlier versions and on the bottom right corner for AoE3).
Hovering your mouse over the buttons that appear on the panel will reveal tooltips that will inform you what the technology is about and what it costs to research it.
 Most technologies in Age of Empires cost Food and Gold to research, but a few require Stone and/or Wood. Gather the resources required to research the technologies you want by assigning your villagers various economic tasks.


In general, make sure you have a lot of resources of all types by creating as many villagers as possible and tasking them with the gathering accordingly.
 Click the research buttons on the building command panels to research the technologies. The more expensive the technology, the more Tech points you are awarded for it.


You are awarded 20% of the resource value of every technology you research.

 Average people, if you have enough game tokens you can buy a compass from the hide Manager that lets you choose the block in the game.;
, It looks like an Olympic court. Anyway, if you got the compass, select which block you want to be after the world vote. If you are early you vote for what land to hide in. After a few seconds, the game will begin.
 You have thirty seconds to run around and hide. Once you find a great hiding space, stand in there and don't even move your mouse. After five seconds, you are solid, so you look like the block. If you are a fence and go solid next to a fence, you will be attached.
 After a while, you get a knock back wooden sword. Sometimes people stay at spawn point and try to kill the seeker, but don't, you will risk your life. If a seeker comes close to where your hiding, don't hit him. This increases the chances of being found. Only do it when another hider close to you is doing it.
 Re-spawn and you will be a seeker. You have ten seconds before unleashed. If you bought seeker power ups before the game, you get to use it.
, Be aware that you have a hit limit, so after twenty hits, you have to wait. If you find a hider, hit it repeatedly until it's dead. Do it quick, they will run away if they can. Also, be prepared. These brats have swords as well, and they are not afraid to use them.
 Attack if you are good at fighting and the group is less than four. If it is a group of five or over, retreat before you die.
 If the seekers manage to destroy all hiders before time runs out, they win. Winning team gets game tokens.

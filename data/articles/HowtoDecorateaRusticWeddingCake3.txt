 Be sure to discuss early on how much you would like to spend on a wedding cake, and begin to compare prices from various vendors to find a reasonable price for your wedding.For a rustic chic wedding, you may wish to decorate the cake yourself or you may want to ask a relative to create a simple, homemade cake. This will help maintain the homemade feel of a rustic wedding while saving on costs.
 A simple, elegant, smaller cake can save on costs and can be just as impressive as a multi-tiered cake.A larger, tiered cake can provide more space and opportunity to decorate, and it will feed more guests. Decide what works best for you, your style, and your guests.


Three tiers can serve 50 to 100 wedding guests, whereas a 5-tiered cake is recommended for weddings with 200 guests or more., Various ingredients and types of wedding cakes may not fair well through certain types of weather. For example, cakes that are made of whipped cream, meringue, and buttercream can melt on a hot day. Talk to a baker about icing options for warm and cold weather.

 Mush, chop or shred it as best you can using your fork and knife.
 For example, if you hate corned beef, cut it into little bits and shove the bits into the mashed potato. Try to smother the hated food with the food you like.
 Swallow it down and be done with it.
 Brave you and well done. Now confess to your parents that you hate that food and ask that you be excused from it in future.

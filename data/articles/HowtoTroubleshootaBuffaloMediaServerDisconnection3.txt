 If the NAS isn’t powered on yet, turn it on by plugging it to a power source., Go to your NAS IP address and log in using the admin account., Click on “Extensions” in the menu to access the extension functions of the NAS., From the Extensions sub-menu, click on “MediaServer.”, Just like other gadgets and technologies, sometimes a system refresh will flush out the errors and restore itself anew.

To restart your DLNA server, just click “Restart DLNA Server,” and the server will restart itself.
 If restarting the DLNA server didn’t work, you can try the same technique with the Wi-Fi router where the NAS is connected. Locate your physical router and restart it.

You can restart your router by either turning it off and then on again after a few seconds, or by unplugging the unit from its power source and then re-plugging it after a few seconds.
Better yet, have the router rest for a bit as it may just be overheated, causing faulty network connections.

, Rinse away any dirt and debris that may be left on the skin, using a scrubber if necessary to make sure it is entirely clean.
 Place a zucchini on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut it into discs that are each about 1–2 inch (2.5–5.1 cm) wide. Discard the two ends of each zucchini.
 Because they have such high moisture content, it's a good idea to salt the zucchini rounds to draw out some of the moisture. This will keep the final dish nice and crunchy.


Lay the zucchini rounds onto a plate lined with paper towels.
Sprinkle them with salt.
Let them sit for 10 minutes.
Use a paper towel to wipe the moisture from each piece.
 Beat the egg and have it ready in a shallow bowl. Melt the butter and mix it with the bread crumbs into a separate bowl. Have your baking sheet ready nearby, so you can transfer the breaded rounds directly to it.
 Slice by slice, dip the zucchini pieces first in the beaten egg, then in the bread crumb bowl. Each side of the slices should be well coated in bread crumbs. Place the coated pieces in a single layer in the baking dish.
 Place the baking dish in the oven and bake the zucchini for 20 minutes, or until the breading is deep golden brown. Remove the dish from the oven.
 They're delicious with marinara sauce or balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

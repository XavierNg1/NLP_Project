 Once you install and run an application, you can easily get your refund without any questions if it has been less than 15 minutes since installation and you are not satisfied with your purchase.;
, Locate the app’s icon on your home screen or app drawer, and tap on it to launch.


The icon looks like a white shopping bag with a colored triangle in the middle.
 This will open Google Play’s main menu.
 A list of all the apps installed on your device will be displayed.
 You will be taken to the app’s information page. If you’re still within 15 minutes from purchase of the app, there will be two buttons on the page: “Open” and “Refund.”


If you’re past 15 minutes, it will be “Open” and “Uninstall.”

,, Your app will then be uninstalled, and a refund will be made to your account.

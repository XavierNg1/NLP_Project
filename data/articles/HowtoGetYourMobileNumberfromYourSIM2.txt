 A few service carriers have a special code you can dial or text that will display our mobile number automatically:

T-mobile customers can dial #NUM# (#686#).EE customers can text the word Number to 150.Vodafone customers on some devices can dial *#1001.
O2 customers can try texting NUMBER to 2020.Telstra prepaid customers can dial #150#.Other carriers may or may not offer this feature. Try searching online for other carrier names followed by "phone codes." As of March 2017, this service is not available from AT&T or Verizon., Some SIM cards do not display their number inside the settings of any phone. For these cases, you may have to call the service carrier of your SIM card and ask.

If you are calling from a phone with the mystery SIM card, the carrier may be able to detect the number automatically. If not, have the SIM card at hand so you can read aloud the serial number.
 Use the SIM card whose number you want to know. Any phone with caller ID will detect the number of your SIM card, unless you are using a private number.

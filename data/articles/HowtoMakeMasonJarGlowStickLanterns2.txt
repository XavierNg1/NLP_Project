 If you are working with new mason jars, all you’ll need to do is use a microfiber cloth to wipe the inside and outside.
 Even though you may not spill glow stick material, you don’t want to take any chances. Take precautions before you break open the sticks.
 Make sure you don't end up having to make several rough cuts as it could create a mess. A sharp pair of scissors should produce a clean cut along the top of the stick.
 Hold a paper towel in the opposite hand so when you are done pouring you can grasp the open end with the paper towel and swiftly (and cleanly) discard the empty glow stick.
 A tight fit is very important in order to avoid a huge mess.
 The coverage will provide for more of a glow and remain illuminated for several hours.

 Monthly water replacements will keep your water fresh and clean. This is especially important if you have algae in your tank.You only want to replace one-third of your tank’s water at any time. Stick a siphon into the gravel to remove water into a prepared bucket. You can then refill the tank with tap water using the same siphon.To make sure that you remove the right amount of water, use a bucket that only holds one third of the amount of your tank. For example, you can use a three gallon bucket for a ten gallon tank. When the bucket fills up, you should stop draining.You can use a special water changer to help with this process. A water changer attaches to your kitchen faucet. When it drains the water, the water is sent down the sink’s drain. You can flip a switch to then refill the tank., There are certain types of fish and marine animals that can help control algae in your tank. While they cannot eliminate all of the algae, they can help keep it under control. If you have crabs, fish, shrimp, or other filter feeders in your tank, you may not need a mechanical filter as the debris in the tank will provide nutrients to your filter feeders.Some filter feeders you may want to consider include:


Rubber nose pleco
Chinese algae eater
Otocinclus catfish
Apple snail (not preferable if you have live plants in your tank), Some of the scum in your tank might be excrement or old food. Not only can this waste cloud your tank, but it can also encourage the growth of algae. If you notice extra food floating in your tank, consider feeding your fish only once a day or in smaller doses., Algae use photosynthesis, which means that they thrive on light. Make sure that your lighting in your tank is only on for ten to fourteen hours a day. This will mimic natural conditions and prevent the growth of bacteria and algae.

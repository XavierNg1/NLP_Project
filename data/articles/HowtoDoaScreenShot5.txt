 You can access the terminal by following the path Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal.


This will cause your terminal or "command prompt" to open as the active window.
 The basic screenshot command is screencapture -iW ~/Desktop/screen.jpg.Change "Desktop" to whichever folder pathway you want to save your image to.
Change "screen.jpg" to match the file name and type you want your screenshot to have.
 Hitting the Enter key on your keyboard will take a screenshot of your entire screen and save it using the name, file type, and location you specified in your command.


This completes the process.

 Anywhere from about $10 to any other higher amount should work well. If you haven't got the money in all sorts of small change, coins included, pop down to the bank and get it changed into small amounts.


The smaller the amount of money, the lower the denominations you'll need to split the notes and coins into to ensure there is enough to fill the holes inside the chocolate box; for example, $10 would need to be about 9 $1 notes and 4 quarters. Or, use a smaller chocolate box.
The currency you're using will also need to be taken into account; there is more coin and note variety in some currencies than in others.
 You'll need to decide which ones require which sorts of folds for the notes and which ones can accommodate coins best. Place the coins in now; you can't do anything else with them.
 This is more fun; try to make shapes that make the notes look interesting, or even like chocolates. When choosing shapes, be sure to align the fold with the size of the hole in the chocolate box. Some examples include:

Fold into squares






Roll into tubes (you can tie with a small ribbon)






Use origami to form chocolate-style shapes






Fold into a 3-D triangle, and stand upright






Fold into a 3-D square and stand upright






Fold so as to highlight an interesting feature on the note; be sure to face it upwards






Roll into a spiral and stand upright.
 Make adjustments as needed to ensure everything looks as neat as possible.
 If it doesn't have such a sheet, cut one from thin cardboard.
 Secure with a big ribbon and bow around the box.


Add a little tape to one spot on the long and short edges to ensure the lid won't fall off.

 Make a mental checklist in your mind of reasons why your baby might be crying that using a pacifier won't help fix.


Perhaps it's the baby feels it's time for a new diaper and doesn't want to feel that way.






Or perhaps it's hungry and it's coming due-time for a fresh baby bottle of formula.






Perhaps the baby is sick, or the room is not quite right (temperature-wise). The reasons are endless.






Check for all conditions on the baby to not be apparent.
Realize that these aren't the only reasons, but are two of the more common ones.;
,, Although your system is different than anyone else's system, some of the more common places the pacifier could be kept could include on a shelf on the changing table underneath the changing station, on top of a dresser, or even in a cup-holder to the nearest baby stroller. The possibilities are endless and you know your house and organization style best.
,, They will eventually open their mouth just a little bit, enough for you to insert the pacifier into their mouth.


If they are wailing at the top of their lungs, you may skip this step.
, The baby may accept the pacifier, or try to push the pacifier out of it's mouth. Repeat the process from the beginning,as the baby may have figured out that the problem it was wailing about, hasn't been "cured" yet.

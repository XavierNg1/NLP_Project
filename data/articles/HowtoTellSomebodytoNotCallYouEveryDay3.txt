 People can often be clingy if they are insecure in their relationship with you or even if they are worried about something going on in their life.Take some time to have a heart-to-heart conversation with the caller to determine if there is a deeper problem that is causing them to reach out to you so often. If you live in the same city, it may be easier to have this conversation face-to-face rather than over the phone.


If the caller is feeling insecure about their relationship with you, assure them of your relationship’s stability by telling them how important they are to you.You might say, “You are one of my closest friends. I can’t imagine my life without you in it.”
It may be possible that the caller is experiencing some mental health problems and is reaching out to you for help. If you sense that they are exhibiting signs of anxiety, depression, PTSD, or other mental health issues, you may need to spend more time supporting them or assist them in seeking professional help., If you see the caller frequently in your everyday life, try finding new people to spend time with. Spending less time with a person who is clingy can help signal to them that you have a life outside of your relationship with them. Like the old adage, “Out of sight, out of mind,” the person may be less inclined to call you if they don’t see you so often and you are not on their mind so much.
 This person may be calling you too frequently because they are bored or have little going on in their lives besides their relationship with you. Suggest that they pursue activities related to their interests by joining a team or a hobby club, taking educational classes, or participating in volunteer opportunities.

 One thing in particular to look for is maps.;
, Buildings that are more often than not older than others can be discovered by the way they are built. Some styles are certain fads, but others could be a certain way simply because other methods are unknown or impractical.
 Large scale events such as wars can affect virtually everything, including availability of materials or trends in future settlement. For instance, typical suburbs in the United States took off apparently to spread out population in the event of nuclear attack, but also because of typical families wanting to have many children in a nice neighborhood after the nasty Depression and World War II. Trends such as this can rattle society to the core.
 The Industrial Revolution was the blossoming point of machine-made products, creating more standard and simply more products. For dating ranches, the invention of typical barbed wire in Illinois by Joseph F. Glidden in 1873 is one to remember. Another one to remember is the public sale of Model T Fords, starting in late 1908. In the American public eye this was basically the first affordable motorcar, and cars obviously affect the way roads are built. Pull tabs weren't around until about 1965.

 One way to use nighttime foliage is to border your garden beds and garden paths. This way, the white flowers and bright foliage will help light your way through the garden in the evening., For the best effect, you want to spread out your nighttime plants. Try not to confine them to one section of the garden or one garden bed. This area will look monochrome and washed out during the day and will not have as impressive of an effect in the evening.For example, you could plant a rose garden with a variety of different colours. Include some white as well. These ones will stand out at night, giving a pop of colour to an otherwise dark garden.
 You can also use nighttime plants to give depth and texture to your garden. For example, try planting a white flowering vine that can climb up the side of your house or fence. Use a trellis of jasmine as a backdrop for colourful flowers. This will look appealing during the day and at night., Water features, such as small ponds, will reflect the moonlight and the white flowers found within your moonlight garden. This reflection will provide additional light and will make your moonlight garden stand out., You can also use white planters and pots to add more brightness and light to your moonlight garden. You can fill these pots with cool hued flowers or silver foliage.

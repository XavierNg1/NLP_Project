 Chemical strippers can be used if what you're after is a quick fix, or the floors themselves were recently finished. If, however, you're dealing with traffic patterns, stains, or scratches, your best bet is to sand away those imperfections and then add another coat to the floor.
 Hand-sand or palm-sand the perimeter of the floor with coarse 180-grit sandpaper. Rub out 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) from the edge of the baseboard so that you're sure to cover the areas your mechanical floor sander can't get to.
 You can rent floor sanding machines at hardware supply stores or equipment rental stores.


Start with a coarse grit and begin to sand the floor. Start off gently. You don't want to gouge the floor. If you get a good sander, you'll even be able to lift up the sander and spend a little more time on heavy-wear or problem areas. Change out your sanding disks as necessary. You may need to change out the sandpaper once or twice using the same grit before you've completely removed the finish.
Using a pencil, color the entire area lightly with streaks of graphite. This will help tell you when you've sanded an area. Otherwise, it'll be tough to tell where you've sanded and where you haven't.
Go over the entire floor again with a medium-grit sandpaper. Look at the pencil streaks to determine whether you've already sanded an area or not. Again, you may need to change the disks on your sanding machine before the job is finished.
 If you hit any wayward nails back into the floor in the prep stage, be sure to save the sawdust so that you can patch and plug the 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) holes created by the nails. This will help ensure a nice, even finish.

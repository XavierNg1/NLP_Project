If you have selected multiple messages, the "Move to" button will be located at the top of the screen.
 You can scroll through the list to see all of the labels.


If you want to create a new label, tap "Create new" at the bottom of the list.
 You can change when messages from labels appear in your inbox, or if they even appear at all. You can set a label so that appropriate messages are added automatically. You can also bundle labels so that all new messages with that label are grouped into one place in your inbox.



See this guide for instructions on setting your label settings.

 Type in the next command into the terminal to make the file executable: chmod +x install.sh. Replace install.sh with the name of your .sh file. Then press ↵ Enter.
 Type in this command: sudo ./install.sh. Again, replace install.sh with the name of your .sh file. Then press ↵ Enter Note: If that doesn't work, try sudo bash install.sh without the "./" (This worked on Ubuntu 16). You will be required to provide an administrative password for this step.

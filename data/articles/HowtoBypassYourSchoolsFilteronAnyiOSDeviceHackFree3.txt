 You can use a search the internet for “Free Proxy Servers” to see what’s out there, but you’ll probably need to do this off-campus. HideMyAss has a great list of free proxies.


Every proxy server has an IP address and port, so make sure to get both.
Some schools block a lot of the ports that proxy servers use. If you’re having a tough time finding an IP proxy that works, that might be the reason.
 Once you have a proxy server, open your Settings app and tap Wi-Fi. Find the network you connect to and tap the blue arrow that points to the right. This will open your network settings.
 Tap "Manual" at the bottom of the screen. You’ll be asked to list the server and port of your proxy. There will also be the option to set up Authentication. You’ll only need to do this if your proxy address also had a username and password listed. If you have a username and password, turn on that option and enter it now.
 If you found a working proxy server, you’ll have unrestricted access to websites.

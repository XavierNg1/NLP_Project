 Scrapbooking lets you keep and creatively display items from school, including the smallest memorabilia. Your scrapbook can document the whole school year or you can focus the contents on specific subjects or events. Scrapbooks generally include photos, documents, notes, and decorations.


Notes, decorations, and titles on pages of the scrapbook are the creative elements that help you personalize the milestones you are documenting.
You can buy scrapbooking kits or you can make you own., You can create a memory quilt featuring your child’s photographs, artwork, and even copies of stories or tests. A quilt will have fewer documents than in an album, binder, or scrapbook, so it is also a good way to focus on an event or a very special set of documents. The quilt squares are documents and photographs that are transferred to fabric squares..


You can send photographs, including photos of schoolwork and artwork, to some photo websites, where they will create a memory quilt for you.
 A shadow box lets you display fewer items than you can in a scrapbook or even a quilt. This is a good way to display items from an event at school, a special project, or field trip. You could also create an overall picture of the school year with your child’s class photo, final report card, and a few examples of their work.


You can make a shadow box yourself or buy one online or at a craft store.

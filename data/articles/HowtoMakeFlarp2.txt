 In a large bowl, pour 8 ounces of glue. Add food coloring. Stir well. If the mixture is paler than you like, add more food coloring and stir again., Pour 8 ounces of liquid starch into the glue mixture. Stir well until the consistency is even. Then let it rest for 5 minutes so the starch can be absorbed.If the texture seems to be uneven and lumpy, continue stirring.
 Line a surface area with parchment paper. Remove the mixture from the bowl. Knead the flarp on the paper for five minutes or so, until its texture is consistently smooth and stretchy. Let it rest for ten minutes or so, and then itâ€™s ready to play with!

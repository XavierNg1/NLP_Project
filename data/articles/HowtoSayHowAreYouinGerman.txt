"Wie geht es dir?" - if you are addressing someone you are well acquainted with, or a friend for instance. It is the informal singular form. It can be shortened in conversation to: "Wie geht's?"
"Wie geht es euch?" - if you are addressing a group of people you are well acquainted with, or a group of friends. It is the informal plural form.
"Wie geht es Ihnen?" - if you are addressing someone higher in hierarchy, someone you do not know or a client, for instance. It can be either a formal singular form or a formal plural form.;
, Train before you actually have to say it, because it's about being natural and not creating an awkward moment. But don't worry, you'll get the hang of it very quickly:

Wie : no problem, you can pronounce it as "vee", except that the vowel is slightly shorter.
geht : it is a sound that doesn't exist in English, but that would be a long .
es : actually, when you say it out loud, you only hear an "s".
dir : a long "e" sound with a barely pronounced "r".
euch : is basically pronounced the same as in "oil". "ch" is a very specific German sound, like the hissing sound of a cat.
Ihnen : it sounds like , and the last syllable is barely pronounced.

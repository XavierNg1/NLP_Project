 Air plants have tiny silver discs or scales all over their leaves. If you look closely at an air plant in bright light, you will see the discs shimmering. These discs absorb moisture and nutrients for the plant.;
, Spray a fine mist until the water drips from the leaves. Use room-temperature water to avoid stress that would be caused by cold tap water. Cold stress could cause the leaves to turn brown and brittle.Mist them in the morning so they will be dry or nearly dry by the end of the day.
Water them less often in the winter during their dormant season.
 They can also be watered by soaking the entire air plant in a sink or bowl of water for 30 minutes once a week. With this method, the air plants should be shaken gently after soaking to remove excess water., If the air plant’s leaves curl or roll up, it is not being watered often enough and has become too dry. Soak it in a bowl of room-temperature water overnight. Take it out of the water the next morning, shake it off and put it back in its place.


Mist it or soak it more often to prevent it from drying out again.
 It can be set directly in front of the window if a sheer curtain is hung between the plant and window.The optimum amount of light will result in a vigorous air plant with healthy green or gray-green leaves. Inadequate light will cause slow growth and pale leaves. Excessive light will turn the leaves tan, dry and brittle.
 This is particularly helpful if there isn't a bright, sunny window in the house. Use a special fluorescent bulb designed for plants that provides full spectrum light. Set the light up so that the bulb is 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) above the air plant and leave it on for 12 to 18 hours each day, depending on how much natural light it receives.


The light should be turned on in the morning around sunrise and turned off 12 to 18 hours later.

 Allowing them to completely air dry will keep the oil from sputtering if you choose to deep fry them.Water can be very dangerous when introduced into oil so the less water you add to the frying oil, the better.
 Blanching is a technique that uses lower-temperature oil for a long duration during frying. This ensures that the potato will be cooked all the way through.To blanch, heat the oil on a medium-low setting. Add your fries and cook for approximately eight minutes. When the fries make a “screaming” noise, they are ready to come out. The screeching is the sound of air whistling out of the inside as they cook.The fries shouldn’t be browned, but will be edible. Upon removing, allow the fries to drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil.


When deep frying, use a deep pot or wok with a thick bottom.Fill it halfway with vegetable oil and allow to heat completely before using.
Frying can be made much easier with the use of a frying thermometer. This will allow you to control the temperature more accurately. When blanching, ideal oil temperature should be 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 Celsius)., Give the fries time to cool before frying a second time.For a quick turnaround, put them on a pan in a single layer inside the freezer. Otherwise, allow them to rest in the fridge overnight in a paper-towel lined sheet.


No matter the method, allow the fries to come back to room temperature before the second frying. This allows even cooking., Heat the oil to 325-350 degrees Fahrenheit (160 - 175 Celsius).Add the blanched fries to the oil in small batches to prevent over crowding. Cook for three to five minutes or until the fries are golden brown in color. Remove and pat excess oil off using paper towel.Serve immediately.


Season with kosher salt, garlic salt, or seasoning salt.

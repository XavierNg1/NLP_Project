 Identify and treat your infection with antifungal medication. If your nail is yellowing, thickening, crumbling or lifting away from the nail bed, you may have a fungal infection.








Heal your infection by using either an antifungal gel, an antifungal cream, an antifungal nail polish, or by taking an oral medication that you get from the store or are prescribed by a doctor., Your nails don’t do well when they’re exposed to harsh chemicals, which can be found in cleaning products.Wearing protective gloves will prevent bacteria, fungus, and other germs from developing under any of your nails.
 While it’s a relaxing and enjoyable experience for many, those who go to the nail salon frequently are more likely to have dry, brittle nails that are also more prone to infections. The chemicals used in professional manicures and pedicures are too harsh and the tools used may carry germs since they’re used on many other customers., When removing nail polish, try avoiding removers with an acetone or formaldehyde base. These removers may be a bit more powerful and effective, but their harsh ingredients leave your nails weak and dehydrated.Use acetate-based removers instead.









Quick-dry nail polish can also create this dehydrating effect.

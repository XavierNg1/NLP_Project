 Fill your brew kettle with about 3 gallons (11.3 L) of water. You should have enough headspace in the kettle to allow for a vigorous, prolonged boil. Note that about half a gallon (2 L) of this water will evaporate during the boil; this is to be expected.
 If your beer recipe calls for specialty malts, tie the malted grains into a grain bag. Bring the water to about 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius), turn off the heat, and then add the specialty malt. Let the grains steep for about 30 minutes.
 After removing the specialty grains, turn the heat back on and bring the kettle to a boil. Slowly stir in your liquid or dried malt extract, which will act as your beer's base malt. Stir continuously to keep the malt extract from burning on the bottom of the pot.
 As the malt and water mixture (now called "wort") begins to boil rapidly, you will see a rapid build-up of thick foam on the surface. This is called the "hot break," and is caused by the proteins in the malt. Watch the heat carefully to prevent boil-over, reducing it if necessary. The hot break will dissipate gradually over about 10 minutes.
 Hops are the ingredient that give a beer its bitterness and floral flavor. The longer they are boiled, the more bitterness they impart, but the less flavor they impart. To correct for this imbalance, you will add the hops at 3 different points.


Add the bittering hops just as soon as you've let the hot break settle a bit. Note that this first hop addition will cause some extra foaming.
Add the flavoring hops with only 15 minutes left to go in the boil. These hops are used to provide floral and fruity flavors to the beer.
Add the finishing hops to the boil with less than 5 minutes left in the boil. These hops impart the beer's aroma.
Remove all of the hop bags when the boil is finished.

 For this sample, 13.7 centimeter (5.4 in) and 10 centimeter (3.9 in) are the measurements forming the length of the shape (which is called an isosceles trapezoid.)On the two sides that are smaller, (10cm), the bottom of the trapezoid is 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in).
The larger pieces are basically trapezoids, but have tabs coming off them. The bottom of the trapezoid part of the pieces is 5 centimeter (2.0 in). When creating the tabs, one will need to be shorter than the other to go under the flash.
 If you didn't make the templates, cut out the shapes that are drawn on the cardboard.

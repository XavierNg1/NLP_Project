 You'll need at least 3 feet (0.9Â m) on either side of a sink and some more besides.
 Your applesauce will be thoroughly cooked when you are through, so don't worry about "sanitizing" too much., Apples are juicy, and you will be dealing with a certain amount of spillage no matter how careful you are, so it's best to be prepared. A towel under the chopping board area, a towel under the jar filling area, and a towel to place the hot jars on (using it as a largish "hot pad") works well., You'll need a cutting area, a filling area, and a cooling area (approx 3 linear feet per area)., Expect to clean it again when you are finished canning.

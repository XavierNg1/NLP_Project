 Most sports photography requires a more expensive single lens reflex camera (SLR). A budget less than $500 will, in general, limit you to point and shoot cameras.;
, Sports photography is nearly impossible with point and shoot cameras due to their shutter lag and fixed lens. DSLRs have a large sensor, shutter lag measured in milliseconds, interchangeable lenses, fast auto-focus, and are able handle low light situations much better than point and shoot cameras.
 For example, internal auto-focus motor, megapixels, high ISO capability (e.g. ISO 3200), size, zoom, type of batteries, battery life, etc. The features that are most important to you depend heavily on what kind of sports you are photographing. If you plan on shooting indoor sports, you will need higher ISO capabilities.
 Equipment, especially sports photography equipment, can get very expensive. Be prepared to make compromises.
 you may get a great DSLR, but you won't get great sports shots with an inadequate lens. For sports photography, you usually want a telephoto zoom lens that goes to 200mm or greater. Depending on where you will be shooting, you may require a "faster" lens (i.e. one with a low f stop number, usually 2.8 or lower). This allows the camera to take in as much light as possible to get the recommended shutter speed of 1/1000 of a second to really shoot the fast action.
, If you invest a lot of money into lenses and accessories, changing brands can be a costly adventure.

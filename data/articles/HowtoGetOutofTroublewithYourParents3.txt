 If you keep getting into trouble because your phone bill is too high or you get bad grades, strive to change your behavior to demonstrate that you can be trusted. Make a pledge to yourself to keep your phone bill under control, for example, and track your usage for the month. Point out in a humble way that you have changed your behavior. Show them your phone bill when it is well under your limit.
 Sometimes it’s not worth using energy to fight over something small. When you constantly fight over things, from what to eat to when you have to be home, you and your parents get “battle fatigue.” Choose the most important things to put up a fight over, and let the smaller things go., If your parents don’t understand things you like to do, give them an introduction to these things. Take them to the new skate park, for example, or have them listen to your new music. Tell them what you really like about an activity or hobby. Getting them involved in your life will help them understand you better., You might want to spend more time with your friends, but spending quality time with your parents is a good way to connect. Schedule a few times a week to have short conversations when you can catch up and tell your parents about your day.


Plan a special time at least once a month when you do an activity together, such as going for a hike or working on a hobby or project.
 As with anyone whose relationship you value, be thoughtful and treat your parents kindly. Do special favors for them or leave a nice note for them.

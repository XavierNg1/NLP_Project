 A variety of software exists to remove the Digital Rights Management (DRM) protection from your iTunes files and convert the files to play efficiently on a standard DVD player.


Use free all-in-one software from the Aimersoft or Wondershare websites. Both websites will remove the DRM protection from your files as the files are burned to a DVD at the same time. Each website also offers software for both Macintosh and Windows computers.
Visit any search engine and use keywords such as "burn iTunes to DVD" or "create a DVD in iTunes" to locate websites that offer similar types of software.
Review each website that offers this type of software to determine if you will be required to pay any fees or subscribe to other services in order to obtain the software.



Visit either the Aimersoft or Wondershare websites provided in the Sources section of this article, then select the appropriate link to download the appropriate version for your Windows or Macintosh computer.
Follow the prompts provided on your screen to download and save the software to the desired location on your computer.



Launch the conversion software you downloaded to your computer.
If you are using Aimersoft or Wondershare, click on the "Add Video" button on the far, left side of the toolbar to import your iTunes movie into the application for the burning process.
Follow the screen prompts to remove the DRM protection from your files, then click on the "Burn" or "Burn to DVD" button within the application to begin burning the movie to your DVD. The DVD you create will then play your movie files in any standard DVD player.
Contact each website directly if you require additional support while using the software you downloaded.

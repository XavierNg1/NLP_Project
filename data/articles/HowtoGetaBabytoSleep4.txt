 Putting the baby to bed at the same time every night will help his/her body expect to sleep at a certain time. Aim for putting the baby to bed between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. every night.
 Help your baby wind down in the evening by playing quiet games. Keep activity and noise for the daytime. Play your babyâ€™s favorite game right before bedtime so he/she knows he'll/she'll do something fun right before bedtime. , A warm bath can be a relaxing way to wind down. Let the baby splash around in the tub for a little while and then dress him/her in cozy clothes for sleeping.
 Cuddle up with your baby and read a book to him/her in a calm, quiet voice. Even if he/she is too little to understand it, he/she will respond well to your closeness and relax with the sound of your voice.
 Consistency is key with babies. Aim to have the same bedtime routine every night. For instance, try giving the baby a bath, then playing a few games, then reading a book and then turning off the light.

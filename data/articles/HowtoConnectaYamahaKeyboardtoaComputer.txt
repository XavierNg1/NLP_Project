 Your Yamaha keyboard may have different USB ports depending on the model. Inspect the back of your keyboard to look at the ports, and you should see a USB port behind it.


To be sure what your keyboard uses as a USB connector, consult your keyboard's user manual beforehand.;
, The keyboard will need a piece of software that will enable the inputs on the keyboard to be recognized by your computer. Head over to this link:



http://download.yamaha.com/usb_midi/index.html for the drivers
This should take you to the official Yamaha website, where they host the files for the driver.
 Scroll down until you see the USB-MIDI Driver for Mac OS X, and choose the latest one.


You will know if it is the latest judging by the version number enclosed in the parentheses.
 Install the driver after downloading it by extracting the files from the .zip file you downloaded. Right-click on the downloaded zip file, and select “Open With” from the context menu.


It should expand and let you choose “Archive Utility” as a default. The file should then extract to the folder where the zip file was located. Double-click the folder and choose the file with .pkg as its file format. It should then install the software.
 Do this by using the USB connector. Plug one end to the USB port at the rear of the keyboard then plug the other end to a vacant USB port on your Mac.


You computer should detect the keyboard, and it should be ready for use with Garageband or any other audio production software.

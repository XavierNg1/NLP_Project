 You may actually feel an external hemorrhoid when cleaning yourself: it will be a tender swelling around the anal opening. You won’t usually feel internal hemorrhoids, but they can bulge through the anal opening.;
, If you don’t want to take a full bath, you can take a Sitz bath,where you sit in a few inches of water. Add about 1 cup of Epsom salts to a full bathtub and 2-3 tablespoons of Epsom salts for a few inches of water in the tub. Keep the water warm, but not too hot. Repeat 2-3 times a day. This may seem like a bit of a “chore”, but so are hemorrhoids!

, Get a clean, cotton wash towel and soak it in warm (not hot) water. Apply the compress directly to the hemorrhoids for about 10-15 minutes. Repeat 4-5 times a day. This should offer some soothing comfort.
 You can use a cotton pad soaked in witch hazel after a bowel movement. Witch hazel acts as an astringent and may help reduce swelling. Repeat as often as needed--at least 4-5 times a day., After having a bowel movement, be sure that you clean yourself completely to avoid irritation. You might want to use baby wipes or a pre-moistened toilet paper product rather than dry toilet paper to clean yourself.,, Find a foam cushion or a doughnut cushion to sit on--this can help relieve some of the pressure associated with hemorrhoids. While this will not aid in "curing" your hemorrhoids, it may help ease your discomfort and make them easier to live with.

 Poop of breastfed children can come in many shades. Your baby’s poop might be green, brown, or yellow. The texture might be seedy or pasty, and might be as runny as diarrhea.It will also, compared to normal poop, smell a bit sweet.


Yellowish to yellow-green, grainy poop is also normal starting at about five days after birth for breastfed babies. Your baby’s stool will be loose.
Green-brown, yellow-brown, yellow-green hues are all also normal for breastfed infants.
 Babies who are not breastfed will have healthy poop of either a mustard yellow or a brown color. Their stools are likely to be larger and less frequent than those of babies who are breastfed. The texture should resemble peanut butter.Medium brown poop is completely normal. Formula-fed infants may produce light brown and pasty stool.
Light-tan or yellow-tan poop is also normal. This tends to happen more in formula-fed babies.
 If your baby’s poop is of a normal consistency -- which, depending on the baby, could range from the firmness of hummus to peanut-butter -- other colors alone need not cause concern about your baby’s health. However, there are a wide variety of other colors linked to various foods.


If the baby has eaten berries that have become undigested, the poop may be of a streaked dark-blue color.Pumpkin or carrot might cause your baby’s poop to be orange due to the beta carotene (an antioxidant) within the vegetables. Orange poop might also result from a random mix of other foods.
Spinach, broccoli, and other green foods might dye your baby’s stool green.
Foods or drinks with food color or dyes can also change the color of the poop.
In addition, certain medicines can occasionally change the color of the poop, as well as lead to some diarrhea or constipation. For example, an antibiotic called cefdinir can cause orange poop, and iron supplements can lead to dark green poop.

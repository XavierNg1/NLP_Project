 The first thing you need to work out is why your relative feels compelled to start cleaning; it may have nothing to do with passing a criticism on your own standards of cleanliness or feeling as if everyone's being too lazy. If could be out of boredom, habit, or feeling that this is the best way to repay you for having invited them along.;
, Offer to take them somewhere for activities or let them take the car. Maybe there are things that they can do around the holiday home that are more interesting than cleaning, like gardening, or helping to fix anything needing repairs.
 Consider something like:


I appreciate your efforts doing the housework. It's just that when I'm on vacation, I like to be able to relax and having someone working hard around me causes me to feel guilty and stressed, and makes me feel as if I should also be doing housework instead of relaxing. I came here to relax and while it's very kind of you to want to clean up, I'd love it if you could just enjoy the opportunity to relax on vacation too. I am happy to do the housework when we leave but not till then."

, If you cannot stop your relative from doing the housework, spend as much time as possible outside and away from the holiday home. With any luck, that'll put a stop to the vacation housework obsession!

 Turn the oven on to 425 degrees F (218 C). Wash two whole butternut squashes and carefully cut off the ends of the squash. Peel the squashes and set the squashes on the flat ends. Use a large chef's knife to chop the squashes into large chunks.Try to keep the chunks the same size. This will ensure that they roast evenly.;
, Cut the tip off of one head of garlic and place it on a large baking sheet. Add the chunks of butternut squash and drizzle one tablespoon of olive oil over the squash and garlic. Roast them in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.The squash should be tender when you insert a fork or knife into a piece.
 Scoop the roasted butternut squash into a food processor. Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves out of the skins once the garlic is cool enough to handle. Place the garlic in the processor. You'll need to add these seasonings:3 sage leaves
1 teaspoon of cumin
Â½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper

, Put the lid on the food processor and blend the dip ingredients until they're completely combined and smooth. Scoop the dip into a serving bowl and serve it along with crackers, chips, or vegetables.Although you can refrigerate the butternut squash dip, let it come to room temperature before you serve it.

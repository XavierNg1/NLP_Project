 No one wants to be friends with someone who has a whole other attitude. Just be yourself, but if you were shy so much last year, try to cut down over the summer.;
, No one will notice you if you don't talk to them. If you're not much of a conversation person, then just say hi. There's nothing wrong with that.
 If you do so, then more people will start to notice you and ask you questions. Also, keep your hair clean.
, Don't let the mean people bring you down on your first day, just say something like "leave me alone". That bully shouldn't be picking on a new kid.
 No one wants to know that stuff. And telling someone your secret can just be a very stupid move if you don't know them.
 You will meet more people. Say, you like art and drawing. Then you could join an art club. Try meeting people there and saying hi. Sit by them. Just try to act like you've been to the school before.
 Then you will be known as a loser or non cool kid. Try to sit by some girls or boys you think might like you. If they move away, then just try somewhere else. If people keep moving away, then just eat alone if you absolutely have no choice.
 Lots of people don't like the very smart people. You can still be smart in school subjects, just don't act like it in front of other people. People will think you're weird.

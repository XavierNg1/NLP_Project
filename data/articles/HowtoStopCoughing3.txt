 The FDA states that most OTC medications can cause side effects in children under the age of 4. Keep this in mind when treating your child's cough.


Cough drops should not be used for children under the age of 2. They are dangerous and considered a choking hazard at this age.
 Making things easier on the throat lessens the side effects of your child's cold or flu. Take steps to minimize their symptoms.


Offer plenty of fluids. Water, teas, and juices are fine (breast milk for babies as well). Stay away from sodas and citrus drinks that may irritate the throat.
Sit in a steamy bathroom for around 20 minutes and put a humidifier in their bedrooms. These methods may clear the nasal passageways, reduce coughing, and make for easier sleep.
 If your child is finding it difficult to breathe or the cough has lasted longer than 3 weeks, seek a medical professional immediately.


If the child is under 3 months old or the cough is accompanied by fever or other symptoms, this is especially important.
Take note if the cough happens at roughly the same time every year or is caused by something specific--it may be allergies.

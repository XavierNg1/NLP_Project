 In order to write about sports, you need to be an expert in all things related to sports. There are several things you can do in order to develop a broad knowledge base. First, watch and attend as many sports games as you can. Practice memorizing coach and player names and positions on the team. Also, watch and take notes on interviews with players and coaches in order to learn the kinds of questions journalists ask.


You can also become an expert by joining a team. By joining a team, you will become familiar with the actual mechanics of the sport, like the game's rules, the player's positions, and strategies used by players and coaches to win games. This will enable you to write more candidly about the sport as a journalist.
Familiarize yourself with game statistics like team win-loss ratio, player ratings, and injury statistics, as well.
 Once you have basic training in journalism, apply for a sports writing internship. This is very important because it will give you job experience. Job experience is invaluable and will give you an edge when applying for jobs. It will also help you determine if you prefer newspaper, online, television, radio, or magazine journalism.You can obtain an internship through your college program. Ask your program about the internships that are available to you.
Also, look for internships through your local newspaper, magazine, or newsletter.
 Having a niche can make a huge difference in a competitive sports journalism world. Focus on sports that you are passionate about, for example, soccer, tennis, football, or volleyball. You can also research sports that are underreported, for example, rugby. This will enable you to make your sports writing stand out and desirable.

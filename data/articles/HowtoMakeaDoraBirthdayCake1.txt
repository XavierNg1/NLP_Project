 Dora the Explorer cake templates are available online. Using the search engine of your choice, search for a cake template using the criteria "Dora the Explorer 9- by 13-inch cake template" and download your preferred template. Print the template to use as a guide for creating the Dora cake.
 Transfer the cake pan to a wire rack and allow it to cool for approximately 10 minutes. Invert the cake onto a wire rack and let it cool completely., Slice across the top of the cake with a serrated knife to make the cake level. Place the trimmed side down on a serving platter.

Use the template as a guide to cut the shape of the Dora cake. Place the printed template directly on the top of the cake and cut along the edges of the template with a serrated knife.
Use the template as a guide to mark the outlines of Dora's face and/or body. Using a toothpick, mark the outlines of the Dora pattern on the surface of the cake. The outlines will help you determine where to apply frosting colors on the cake.
 Prepare frosting and other decorations according to the template directions. Some templates require tinted frosting, while others use melted chocolate. Gather other supplies as directed on the template, such as candy-coated chocolate for eyes or fruit leather for a mouth.

Pipe the frosting on the cake using a pastry bag with a decorator's tip or a resealable bag with a small corner snipped from the bag.

 This is the length of one side of the triangular base. If it doesn’t measure well into whole feet, feel free to measure it in inches for now.


Ex. 9 inches (22.9 cm).
 This is the distance between the side you previously measured and the point directly opposite it on the triangular base. If you measured the base in inches instead of feet, be sure to do the same with the height to stay consistent.


Ex. 12 inches (30.5 cm).
 This gives you the two-dimensional area of the triangular base of the pyramid.



Ex. 9 inches (22.9 cm) x 12 inches (30.5 cm) = 108 square inches

108 square inches / 2 = 54 square inches



, Be sure to measure in a straight vertical line from the bottom to the top, not a diagonal line that follows one of the sloping sides. Write down this number.


Ex. 32 inches (81.3 cm).
 This gives you a three-dimensional, or cubic, measurement.


Ex: 54 square inches x 32 inches (81.3 cm) = 1728 cubic inches.
 Since the length times width times the height gives you the volume of a cube, not a pyramid, you must modify this result to find the volume of a pyramid instead. To do this, divide by three. This works with all pyramids.


Ex. 1728 cubic inches / 3 = 576 cubic inches.
 To convert from cubic inches to cubic feet, divide the result by 1728.


Ex. 576 cubic inches / 1728 = 1/3 cubic foot.

With the daith, one side of the heart will go through your ear. In the helix, both sides of the heart go down through the ear, with the bottom meeting in the point of the heart and curves of the heart going above the ear.If you don't have many piercings, you may decide the daith is easier since it's a single hole, although some people have more trouble with this placement than the helix placement.

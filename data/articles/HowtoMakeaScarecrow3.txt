 You can give your scarecrow facial features using an endless array of materials. Decide whether you want him to look smiling and happy or grumpy and menacing. Here are some ideas:


Draw on his eyes, nose and mouth using a black magic marker.
Cut out triangular shapes from pieces of colored felt for eyes and nose. You can sew them on or attach with hot glue.
Use different sized or colored buttons for eyes, nose and mouth. Sew on or attach with hot glue.
Use bits of black plastic or pipe cleaner to make eyebrows. Slant them downwards to make an angry scarecrow.
 Glue some straw to your scarecrows head to give the effect of hair. Don't worry about making it look neat, he's supposed to look scary, after all! Alternatively, glue an old wig to his head or use an old mop.
 You can personalize your scarecrow by accessorizing it any way you like. His most important accessory, however, is a straw hat. Use any old hat you have lying around and secure to his head with hot glue. Here are some other (optional) accessorizing ideas:


Tie a red bandana around his color, or leave a bright handkerchief peeking out of his pocket.
Jazz up his hat using some brightly colored plastic flowers.
Stick an old pipe in his mouth.
Tie reflective or shiny ribbon to your scarecrow to add movement and reflect light.,

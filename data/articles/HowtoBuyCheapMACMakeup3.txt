 Many phone books have a section listing different businesses. Search for cosmetic wholesalers.
 Ask about the merchandise they carry, their prices, if they have a minimum order and how much they charge for shipping items. Write all of this information down on a piece of notepad paper.
 Limit your selection to 1 business and place your order.

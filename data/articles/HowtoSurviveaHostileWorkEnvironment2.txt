 Most companies have specific guidelines about harassment, discrimination, and inappropriate workplace behavior and etiquette. It’s a good idea to review these policies so that you can evaluate whether they are being followed.
 Review employee handbooks or training manuals to see if your employer provides specific instructions for addressing workplace grievances. If these are in place, document your efforts to conform to these procedures.


Evidence that you followed these instructions strengthens your case in the event that you have to seek the help of higher-up employees or outside assistance.
 If you have to address the issue of a hostile workplace environment with supervisors, human resources, union representatives, or attorneys, you will need to provide specific evidence to support your concerns.Save relevant emails and written correspondence.
Take notes during meetings and phone conversations.
Keep a log or diary detailing the date, time, and circumstance of specific encounters or incidents.
Work with other affected or involved employees to draft statements and reports detailing grievances or incidents that occur.
Keep the records you collect in a secure place where coworkers or supervisors won’t have access.
 Don’t be afraid to ask for help from a colleague, a supervisor, or a member of human resources. They can provide valuable information and advice on how to improve the workplace environment.


Coworkers you approach might feel the same way, and talking with them about the situation will help everyone feel less alone.
While it might feel daunting to contact supervisors and human resources staff about a hostile work environment, it's their responsibility to address employee concerns and resolve problems that have a negative impact on employee productivity and the work environment.

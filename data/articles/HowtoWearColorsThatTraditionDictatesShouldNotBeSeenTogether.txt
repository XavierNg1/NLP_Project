 The tradition says to avoid this mixture but careful combining can make it a stunning color set. The trick to pulling off this one is to choose a cream that is obviously cream so that it doesn't appear to be "dirty white". Another way to ensure that this look works is to wear clothing that is textured, patterned, or of a very unusual cut.;
, This is probably the most well known color fashion no-no of them all and that makes it the most fun to break. To make this one work, tone down one color and allow the other one to dominate. For example, pale pink and bold red will work well together, whereas hot pink and bold red wouldn't.


Use accessories in the contrasting color when first experimenting with this color change. Let it grow on you gradually.
 To avoid appearing too somber, avoid darker shades of brown that will be lost too easily in the black. The brown shades that go beautifully against black include tan, beige, cognac, and camel.
 Blue and green should never be seen? As with red and pink, the trick is to ensure that one color does not overwhelm the other. Try a dark blue with an emerald green contrast and see how it works on you.

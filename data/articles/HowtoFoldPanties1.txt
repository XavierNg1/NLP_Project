 The front side of the panty should be facing up. Lay it out so that one end of the waistband is closest to you.









Smooth your hand over the panty to flatten it out.;
, You want it to be flush with the top of the pantyâ€™s waistband. Your panty should now be folded in half horizontally.









Smooth your hand over the panty once more to ensure the item is as flat as possible before starting the roll up.
 Start with whichever side is closest to you and work your way to the other. This will roll the panty into a small, easily storable scroll.









This method will also work for thong panties, although the size of the scroll will be much smaller upon completion.
 Place them side by side. Do only one layer of the rolled panties so that you can easily find what you're looking for without messing up your organization.









If you're more concerned with compact storage, do multiple layers of panty rolls.

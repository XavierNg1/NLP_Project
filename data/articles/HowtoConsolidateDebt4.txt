 Credit cards usually have relatively high interest rates even when compared to unsecured loans from banks. However, if you have good credit history, you may be eligible for exceptionally low-interest credit cards. If so, you can use this new credit card to pay off high-interest debts. To start, shop around for credit card offers that have low interest rates - you may want to look online or to contact credit card companies with whom you already have a good history.


As with the methods of consolidation above, you'll want an interest rate that's lower than the interest rates on your current debt.
 Credit cards have limits to the amount of money they allow you to spend. To effectively consolidate your debt, your new credit card should have a credit limit that's large enough to pay off all of your current debts. This way, after you do so, you'll only have to make one payment - the one on your new credit card.
 Some credit cards offer an initial period during which interest payments and/or balance transfer fees are very low or are waived entirely. These cards are ideal if you are able to pay all (or nearly all) of your debt off during this low-interest period. If you can, sign up for one of these cards and pay off the balance prior to the expiration of the introductory period to save money that you would otherwise spend on interest.


Pay attention to the fine print of your credit card agreement - often, cards with initial 0% interest periods will immediately begin to incur high interest at the end of this period.

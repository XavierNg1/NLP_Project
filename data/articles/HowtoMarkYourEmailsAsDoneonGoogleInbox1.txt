 Locate the Inbox app on your device; it’s the blue-colored envelope. Tap on the application to open.


If you don’t have Inbox yet, you can download and install it from your device’s dedicated app store (iTunes App Store for iOS users and Google Play Store for Android).;
, If you had logged out of your previous Inbox session, or if this is the first time you’ve accessed the app, you will be asked to log in. Use your Gmail login details to access your account.
 If you want to mark your emails as done, you must first select them. Go through and find the emails you want to mark as done, and tap and hold the email to select it.


You can do this with as many emails as you need.
 The emails will be marked as done and will slide off your screen, giving you more room and organization in your inbox.

 This doesn't mean if you wear a lot of red you have to choose red; you could choose another color that goes well with it like orange.;
, How long the dye lasts can range from two or so weeks to permanent (will last until your hair grows out). This also ranges on how healthy your hair is.
 Some popular choices are bangs or front sections dyed, the underside of the hair, and tips. Dying all your hair could be very damaging and beware: the color may not look the same after a few weeks. Ensure that you want this color all over your hair.
 These can be found at Hot Topic, Spencer's, Static, etc. Some beauty supply stores stock a few of these colors also.
 The dye, even if not permanent to hair is VERY permanent to skin and does not look pretty, especially if you are dying your hair for a special occasion.
, The rest of the hair should be secured so that no dye accidentally gets onto it. If you are dying all of your hair, skip this step.
 Follow all of the instructions on the box or bottle. Bleach is damaging to hair, so don't leave it in for too long or your hair will become brittle and frizzy.
 Dry hair with another old towel and comb it thoroughly. If using the same gloves throughout the process, rinse them also to make sure no bleach mixes with the dye. This produces an unsatisfactory color. If not, change your gloves.
 Starting from the scalp down, apply the dye to the sections until they are fully saturated. Do not apply so much that it drips onto the other part of your hair. To make sure it is even, use a comb to spread it out from root (or other starting point) to tip (or other ending point).
 Keep the gloves on and keep the hair and water away from the body and the rest of your hair, as it will stain.

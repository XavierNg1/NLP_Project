 To begin making a classic smoky cheese ball, shred the 2 cups (473.17 ml) of smoked cheese. You can use either cheddar, Swiss or Gouda. Cheddar will give your cheese ball a sharper flavor, whereas Swiss and Gouda will make the cheese ball slightly milder., Once you have shredded the smoked cheese, add the smoked cheese, cream cheese and butter or margarine into a large mixing bowl. Mix the ingredients together with an electric mixer or by hand until combined, then let them sit until they reach room temperature., Pour in the 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) milk and 2 teaspoons (9.85 ml) of steak sauce into the mixing bowl and mix with an electric mixer or by hand until the mixture is fluffy, about 2 minutes with an electric mixer and 5 minutes by hand., Once the mixture is combined and fluffy, place the bowl in the fridge for 4-24 hours. Chilling the cheese mixture will help it get firmer so that it’s easier to shape into a ball., Once you have chilled the cheese, take the bowl out of the fridge and scoop out the mixture. Use your hands to shape the cheese mixture into a ball., Finely chop 1 cup (240 ml) of pecans or walnuts, then spread the chopped nuts on a cutting board or clean surface. Roll the ball of cheese in the chopped nuts until they coat the surface of the cheese ball. Then serve the cheese ball with pretzels or crackers.If you aren’t serving the cheese ball immediately, put it in the fridge to keep it cool. The cheese ball can be kept in the fridge for up to one week.

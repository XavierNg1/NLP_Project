 Copy the sheet you used, and start adapting it. Consider the list of items, and correct the worth where necessary, for example, deduct 1% for a car per month, and especially update the fast-changing things, like bank account and cash. Remember also your loans might have decreased, if you paid something off.
 Did it increase, or did it decrease? If it decreases, you might be living beyond your means. If it increases, you are accumulating wealth, which is generally a good thing.
 Typical US customers have a low savings quota, around 0% or even negative. In many European countries, a savings quota of 15-20% is considered normal.
 All your little estimation errors accumulate, and the result may just not be exact enough. Keep repeating it after another month or year. If you see a consistent direction, and you are sure you are not forgetting something relevant, take it more serious.


It is your decision what savings quota you want to target at, but with 0% you will have nothing when you retire, which does not sound to attractive. On the other hand, many people would consider saving 20% of their income as too much. You should try to stay safely away from 0%, and of course on the positive side.

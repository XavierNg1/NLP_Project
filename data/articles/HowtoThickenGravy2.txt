 A roux is a thickened mixture made from a fat and flour. This method is more time-consuming than the water and flour method, but the risk of lumps is minimized. Normally you should choose a fat like butter, leftover fat from the meat pan, or a suitable oil such as olive oil. The ratio is usually about half fat, half flour, although a little extra flour doesn't hurt. , You want the saucepan to be sturdy so that you can stir in there without the pan moving all over the place. Keep the stove on about medium heat and turn it down if you smell the butter burning. This will depend on what type of stove you have.
 Mix well, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Constant stirring helps to avoid making lumps. When the mixture starts to froth a little transfer it to the gravy. It should take about five minutes before the mixture froths. , Make sure you stir it well, you want the mixture to fully incorporate itself into the gravy. Otherwise you risk your gravy tasting a little strange. Keep stirring until the gravy thickens – that’s how you’ll know the mixture is incorporated. If the gravy still isn’t thick enough to your liking you can always repeat the process with another roux.

 Count the number of tasks your toddler does every day and that will be the number of clothespin you should use.


Get a few extra clothespins, just in case you realize you forgot a task later on.
 At the top of the page, place the image of the first thing your child will do in the morning. The last image on the bottom of the page should be the last thing that your child does at night. Ideas for images include:


Morning: Use images of a toilet or potty, toothbrush, hairbrush, a shirt or dress, bed, breakfast and play to represent going to the potty, brushing teeth, brushing hair, dressing up, making the bed, eating breakfast and playing, respective
Afternoon: Use images of a bed, a book, snacks, and park for the afternoon charts to represent taking a nap, reading a book, eating snacks and walking or playing in the park, respectively
Nighttime: Use images of a plate, toothbrush, bathtub, pajamas, book, praying, and a bed to show dinner time, brushing teeth, bathing, putting on pajamas, reading a book, praying and going to bed, respectively.
 Thread ribbons through the holes and tie the ribbons so you can use these to hang the charts to the hooks on the walls of your toddler’s bedroom.
 Ask your toddler to clip the clothes pins with the words “DONE” on them to each picture of the task that she has finished doing.

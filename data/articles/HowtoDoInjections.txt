 Be sure your hands are completely dry and try not to touch anything that may contaminate your hands before you prepare for the injection.;
, Make sure you are using a clean, new needle or syringe that has not been contaminated.


The syringe may be completely full or partially full.
 You can either hold it in your hand, or you can place it on a clean metal tray designed for this purpose.
 Tightly their arm with a tourniquet underneath the vein where you are planning to inject the medicine in. This will restrict blood flow through that vein and make it easier to see.
 Swab the vein and the area around it where you will be injecting the medicine.
, If the patient appears nervous or scared, gently talk to them and distract them with friendly, soothing questions. While they are answering, smoothly poke the needle or syringe through the vein it is to be injected in. Do not make any sudden jerks or movements. At this point, it's best to have a supporting hand holding the patient's arm to keep them from moving it.


If the patient is a child, you can let him/her sit on his/her parent's lap to bring about a feeling of protection. If the patient's parent isn't in the room at the moment or the patient refuses to sit in his/her parent's lap (sometimes, the patient may feel embarrassed about needing such comfort), suggest that the patient looks away, unless if the patient is fascinated by having a needle injected into his/her arm.
 Keep talking to the patient and distracting them from the pain.
 Make sure you have pulled the needle out from the same angle you injected it in, or you may cause some pain.

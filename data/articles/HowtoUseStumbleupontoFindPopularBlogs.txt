Using the search box, type in your keyword and the search results will return user profiles and actual websites. You can click on people's profiles and add them as a friend. You can also click on the "review" link. You will get a list of people who stumbled to that site, so add them too.
 Each time you click Stumble, you will get human-user rated websites, not artificial algorithm search results like Google gives you. 'Stumbled sites' are based on categories and the number of positive ratings.
 Go to Stumble Button and click settings. Go to Stumbles tab and edit the settings for your stumbles.
 Choose the sites that are relevant to yours and comment on them. Use the Stumble button, or check your profile for the feed from other people's stumbles.
 If you have deemed the site worthy of your comment, then vote for it. Not only will this increase web traffic to the blog, but the more people who visit the targeted site, the more back links created and ultimately the more chance your link will get noticed and you will get a flow of visitors to your site.

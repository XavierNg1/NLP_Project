 Shaking the drink will build up pressure in the bottle.Make sure not to open it after shaking, or it will explode and leave a mess.


You can use whatever flavor soda you prefer.
 The goal is to get your soda as cold as possible without actually freezing the soda. Check on your soda every 20 to 30 minutes to ensure that it hasn't completely frozen.Freezing times will vary depending on your freezer.
 Do not completely remove the cap from the bottle. The goal is to relieve some of the built-up pressure from the soda but not all of it. You should hear air being released from the bottle as you open it.Do this over the sink to prevent a mess.
 Once you set the bottle the right side up again, you should see ice crystals inside of the bottle begin to form. Once you've waited 1-2 minutes, pour it into a glass and enjoy.

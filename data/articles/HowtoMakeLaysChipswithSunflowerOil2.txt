 You can peel as much or as little away as you want. Lay's claims they only do a "gentle peel," which leaves a bit of skin on some of the edges., If you have a mandolin, this will be much easier to do. Set the mandolin to a medium thickness and get slicing. If you are using a knife, slice as thinly as you can without endangering yourself. Aim for regularity over your top thinness -- if they are roughly the same thickness, they will all cook at the same rate.


Baked chips must be a bit thicker than their fried counterparts, so you don't need to go as thin as you possibly can.
 This step is necessary to pre-cook the starches, which allows you to bake the chips later and get them nice and crisp. If possible, use a metal strainer or sifter to boil the potatoes in, which you can carefully lift out with tongs once they chips have finished boiling, letting all the water drain away., You want a nice high cooking temperature to really crisp the edges. This is why your pre-boil -- the potatoes are already cooked when they go in the oven, allowing the high heat to simply crisp them up.
 Add the oil slowly, mixing the whole time, so that you only use enough for a thin coating on all the potatoes. Add the salt generously.
 Do not layer the chips -- they should not be touching each other as they cook. The parchment paper will prevent sticking, which can cause your chips to rip as you remove them later.
 You can flip them once, at about the 7-minute mark, to ensure that they cook equally. This isn't strictly necessary, though it can help for older ovens that may heat up somewhat unevenly., Add a touch more salt and enjoy once cooled. The chips only need a few minutes to become cool enough to eat.

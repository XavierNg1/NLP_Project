 If you inform the police that your phone has gone missing, they may be able to provide limited assistance locating it. Call 911, or the non-emergency police number, to contact your local police office. Local law enforcement will likely ask you for the serial number for your phone. The Android ID number functions as a serial number; you can find your Android ID by removing the battery from the back of your phone and looking beneath. The Android ID will be a series of numbers preceded by the identifier “IMEI” (International Mobile Equipment Identity).When you reach out to the police, say something like, “Hello, I believe that my cell phone has been stolen. It went missing roughly 10 minutes ago, and I first realized the phone was gone when I was outside of the public library on Main St.”

, If you’ve called your phone and looked for it without results, you need to call your phone service provider and inform them that your phone has been stolen. The service provider may be able to run a GPS search to locate your missing phone.If a GPS search is not an option—or if the results are fruitless—ask your service provider to suspend service to your phone. This will prevent the thief from making phone calls and potentially racking up an expensive phone bill.
 Think back to where you may have been when your phone was stolen, and then retrace your steps in that area. The thief may have quickly changed their minds after taking your phone and, if you’re lucky, may have dropped the phone within a few hundred yards of where they stole it.Walk through places where you spent time before your phone was stolen, and continue calling your phone while looking for it.

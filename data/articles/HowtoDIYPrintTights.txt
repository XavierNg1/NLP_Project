 Freehand or download a paper template from the Internet and trace it onto the cardboard.


Use a simplistic design for your stencil. Too many edges and an intricate design may not work well with this project.
Cut out design using your scissors. You will be painting inside the template.;
, For the best result you will need to paint the design directly on the tights while you are wearing them.


Put on solid pair of tights first. In order to protect your skin from the paint, you will need to add a pair of tights underneath the set you plan to paint.
Add the sheer tights over the solid.
 Make sure you like the placement before adding paint.
 You want a thick covering of paint, but not so much so that the paint runs.


Repeat the stencil painting process until you have achieved the look you desire.



Run dryer on both heat and cool settings to set and then dry paint.
 Peel paint away from your bottom pair of tights with care. If you see paint on the bottom pair of tights that appears to be wet, replace tights and allow for longer dry time.

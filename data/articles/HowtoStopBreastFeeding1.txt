 When you're ready to stop breast feeding, you need a suitable substitute that is nutritious enough to meet the baby's needs. Seek guidance from your pediatrician about foods that will ease the baby's transition from breastfeeding to eating from a bottle or cup. These options are among those available to mothers who choose to stop breastfeeding:


Continue feeding breast milk that has been pumped. Just because you no longer want to breast feed doesn't mean you have to stop feeding the baby breast milk. This is a good option for mothers who are unavailable to breastfeed the baby but aren't yet ready to stop feeding the baby breast milk.
Replace the breast milk with formula. Ask your doctor about which fortified formula might be right for your baby.
Replace the breast milk with solid food and cow's milk. If the baby is 4 to 6 months old, he or she may be ready to take solid food along with breast milk or formula. Babies over 1 year old may also have cow's milk.;
, In some cases, ending breast feeding is also a good time to wean the baby from the bottle and have him her or use a cup instead. Take the following factors into consideration:

Babies need liquid nutrition in the form of breast milk or formula throughout their first year, but they can start drinking from a cup as early as 4 months.






Babies who drink from the bottle after age 1 may develop tooth decay and other dental issues.

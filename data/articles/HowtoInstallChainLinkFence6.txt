 Tension bands secure the chain-link mesh to the posts. Use one less tension band than the height of the fence, in feet. For example, if the fence is 4-feet high, use 3 tension bands per post. For a 6-foot fence, use 5 bands, and so on.


The long, flat surface of the tension band should face toward the outside of the fence.
 Terminal posts get end caps. Line posts get looped caps (for the top rail.)

, Leave some slack for adjustments.

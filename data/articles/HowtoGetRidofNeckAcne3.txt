 Some of the things you can readily find in your kitchen are thought to have antibacterial and healing properties, allowing you to quickly whip up an acne-fighting mask.You will need:


1/2 tablespoon of dark colored honey (darker honey has more antibacterial properties)1 egg white (do not use the yolk)
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

, Use a whisk or fork to mix the egg white and lemon juice until it becomes frothy, then add the honey.Make sure that everything is well combined.


You may wish to add other household items, such as 1 teaspoon of witch hazel (which has anti-inflammatory properties)or a few drops of an essential oil like peppermint, spearmint, lavender, or calendula, but it is unclear if these will enhance or reduce the effectiveness of the treatment.
 If you want to treat your whole neck, then you can use your fingers to spread the paste over your neck. If you want to treat a smaller area, then you can use a cotton swab or cotton ball to spread the paste over specific problem areas., Leave the paste alone for about 15 minutes, then rinse it away with lukewarm water. You may need to hop in the shower to do this. Use your fingers to break up the paste as you rinse it away.Pat your skin dry and then apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer to complete the treatment.

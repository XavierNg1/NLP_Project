 Open any web browser on your computer, and go to the Google Maps Ocean View website.
 The underwater locations currently available are displayed on the right panel of your screen. Each of the locations is identified by its name, location, and a thumbnail image. Use the scroll bar on the right to scroll through them.
 A map of the world is also displayed on the lower left part of your screen. The locations that currently have underwater Street View are identified by the red dots.
 Click on either the thumbnail image on the right panel or on the red dot on the map to go to that underwater location.
 The images captured from the underwater location will be displayed. Use your mouse to navigate through the images. Click and drag to move around. Click on the arrows that will appear to move further to a specific area. It will feel like youâ€™re diving as you go past the fishes and reefs.


To exit the underwater view, just click the X at the top of the right panel.

 Good hygiene is a key way to prevent contacting amebiasis, whether you're at home or traveling. Wash your hands with soap and water after you use the restroom, any time you touch garbage, prior to eating or making food, before smoking, after taking care of someone who is ill, and after you change a baby's diaper.Lather up between your fingers, the backs of your hands, beneath your nails, and as high as your elbows; scrub for at least 20 seconds.
If you can't wash your hands, use hand sanitizer made of at least 60% alcohol (ethanol or isopropanol)., Don’t share towels and linens, if you can help it. It’s best to keep everyone’s bathroom towels separate to avoid spreading illness. Hang your towels away from the toilet so they don’t get contaminated.If linens are soiled, put on gloves before cleaning them. Wash them in a separate wash at the highest temperature possible.
 Make disinfecting your toilet a part of your house-cleaning routine. Use hot water and detergent or a disinfecting spray or wipes made for cleaning bathrooms. Wipe down the seat, handle, and basin of the toilet.Use disposable wipes or have a separate towel that you use to clean the toilet.
Wipe down bathroom door handles, countertops, and bathroom taps every day.
 If you have a garden near a septic tank, ensure that the tank is fully contained, not leaking, and is regularly emptied by trained personnel. If you're camping, keep all human waste activities well away from cooking and sleeping areas.

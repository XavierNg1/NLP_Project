Roofing felt is a cheap and easy-to-install material: simply nail the sheets into wood, overlapping each sheet by 3 to 4 inches (or about 10 cm).;
, Divide the area of your roof by the size of the sheets you will be using. Remember that you will want the metal sheets to overlap.
, You should use about 20 nails per sheet. Whenever possible, nail in the valley between the ridges, where the roofing is closest to the wood.
 Secure the sheets together using hex screws and washers.


Whenever possible, line up the ridges of each metal sheet. This will create a tighter roof and make it easier to drill in the screws. Screw in the spaces between where you nailed the first sheet to the wood.
,, Follow the same method as when installing the metal sheets: overlap the ridge caps both with each other and with the sheets, using hex screws and washers where the metal overlaps and nails where the ridge caps attach to wood.


You will use about 40 nails for each length of ridge cap.
 If any roofing is sticking up, secure it as much as possible with nails or screws if attaching it to other metal sheets.

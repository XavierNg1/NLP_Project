 If your canned goods expire, you’ll have to discard them. Throwing away food is like throwing money in the bin. Take action to prevent waste by labeling your canned food with expiration dates.Write the expiration date on the front of your canned foods with a marker. That way, when you open your pantry, you’ll be able to quickly see which canned goods are closest to expiring.
 Once you’ve labeled your canned food by writing the expiration date in bold lettering on the front, order your canned foods based on their expiration dates. Place canned foods closest to expiration toward the front, and canned foods that expire further in the future toward the back. This will help you use items that are closer to expiration first., Even though it is a good idea to stockpile your canned food and buy in bulk, you should still set reasonable limits to how many canned goods you store. For instance, do not buy more canned food than you can fit in your pantry.Check your pantry before heading to the store. If you see that you’re stocked up on canned food, do not purchase additional canned food.
 Prepared canned food – chili, soup, and sauces – tends to be relatively expensive. But raw canned ingredients – fruits, veggies, meats, and legumes – are more affordable.Instead of buying prepared canned food, buy the ingredients to make it yourself, then freeze the dish in small batches that can easily be thawed and reheated.

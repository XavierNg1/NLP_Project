 Look for Internet Explorer on your computer and open it. It can be accessed from the Start menu or from your Quick Launch bar at the bottom of the screen. The web browser will load.;
, Locate the gear icon on the toolbar, and click on it. This will bring down Tools in a submenu.
 Locate Internet options from the submenu, and click on it. This will open a small window for Internet Options. This is where you set up or configure your browser and its parameters.
 This will open the General view of the Internet options. The Home page setting is here.
 The first section of the General tab is for Home Page. It has a text field where you can input the URL or address of the browser’s home page.


The currently set home page, or home pages, will be displayed in the text field.
 Click on the text field and remove the existing home page. Type in the new home page’s URL or address.


If you want to have multiple home pages to be loaded each time you launch Internet Explorer, you can type them in their own line. The field accepts multiple lines. Each home page will load on its own tab.
If you have a set of web pages currently open in Internet Explorer and want these to be your home pages, a quick way to do so is to click on the “Use current” button found right under the Home page field. You don’t need to type each of their URLs or addresses anymore.
If you prefer to have your home page to be blank, you can also do that. Type in “about:blank” in the URL text field.
 Click on the “Apply” button then on the “OK” button from the bottom of the Internet Options window to save your changes and exit Internet Options. The next time you launch Internet Explorer, the home page or home pages you’ve set will automatically load.

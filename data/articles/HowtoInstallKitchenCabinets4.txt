, Cut it to length if required, and cut out the sink opening and the opening for the stove (hob) if it will be built in. You may need to cut the counter top short so that it will set in if it is between two walls. If you allow a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) on the overall length, you can caulk the ends after it is installed.

For post formed (laminate on particle board) counter tops, you will get better results cutting it to length with a "finish", or "plywood" blade rather than a ripping or combination circular saw blade.
Cutting with the counter top upside down will reduce chipping, but make sure you support the piece until the cut is complete.
For cutting a sink opening, invert your sink at the location it will go, mark the outline of the outside rim lightly with a pencil, then make another mark about 5⁄16 inch (0.8 cm) inside this line for your cut. Place masking tape on the outside of the cut mark, and use a jigsaw to make your cut. If you cannot "plunge" your jigsaw (starting inside the cut line), you may drill a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) hole to drop your blade into to start your cut.
Seal all cut surfaces of post formed counter tops before installing to prevent moisture from swelling the material later if your caulking fails to seal.
More durable counter tops can be made from synthetic marble (Corian, etc.), natural granite or other stone, cementuous backerboard or plywood covered with ceramic tile.
 Screw it in from underneath, making sure that the screws you use are not so long that they will break through the material to the top.

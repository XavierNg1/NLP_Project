 You may want to be best friends with someone that does not want to be your best friend. It may hurt your feelings, but know that this just wasn't the right person. Unfortunately, the person may not be straightforward and tell you they do not want to be best friends. Pay attention to their behavior. If you notice any of the following, you may need to find a new potential best friend:


The person makes excuses or is always to busy to hang out with you.
The person does not call or text you first or always takes a really long time to respond.
You always have to initiate conversations with the person.
The person does not want to spend time with you on the weekends or after school.
 If your friend lies, gossips, or is mean to other people, she may not be a good best friend to you. See how she treats and interacts with her other friends. Does she talk badly about them when they are not around? Does she boss them around?


How your friend treats other people is how she will probably treat you.
Since you are looking for a best friend, definitely stay away from girls who gossip about others and tell personal information. You need a best friend you can trust.
 Friendships take time to grow. You do not want to reveal too much personal information in the early stages of friendship. You want to be sure this is someone that you can trust.In the early stages stick to talking about more superficial things such as school, music, TV, or sports teams that you like.
Avoid talking about your fears or family issues early on. Wait until you have known the person for awhile.
If your friend begins to share more personal information with you, this is a sign that you can begin to share the same type of information as well.

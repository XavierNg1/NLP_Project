 This special passbook is available only to people on a tourist visa, must be purchased before arriving in Japan and offers unlimited rides on Japan Railways trains for one, two, or three weeks. A rail pass for one week is around 28,300yen or $300USD for regular cars, to 37,800 Yen or $415USD for green cars. A "green car" on Japanese trains is a luxury car. The difference is very small and you will find that all seats on the Shinkansen are quite comfortable and spacious.
 Near most train stations you can rent a bicycle for the day for under $10. If you're going to tour a whole town you might find that a bicycle is cheaper, more convenient, and more fun than taking the bus or a subway. However, if you come during the rainy season to save money on the plane ticket you may want to stick with the buses and subways. If not, affordable rain gear can be purchased in any convenience store.
 It sounds like bad advice but in Japan hitchhiking isn't nearly as dangerous as it can be in other countries, especially for men. Many Japanese people will drive you as far as they can for nothing more than a few hours of English conversation. It is not recommended for solitary female travelers and is best done in pairs if you do hitchhike. For more details, read Will Ferguson's Hitchhiker's Guide to Japan.

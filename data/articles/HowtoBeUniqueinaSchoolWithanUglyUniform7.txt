 It just doesn't work. Its so obvious if shoes are the wrong color, so don't even bother trying. Some schools will even send you home (in a bad way) if you wear bright colored shoes.(Though sometimes you can sneak in a tiny flash of a color, like bright pink lining or laces).
 Buy shoes that suit you, fit you, look good on you, and reflect your personality.

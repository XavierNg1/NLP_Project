 This person will roll a pair of matched dice. Before rolling, however, the shooter must lay down a bet.A backstop or restraining surface is not required for street craps, although players may choose to use a wall or curb as a backstop or restrain the dice by rolling them in a taut blanket. , The other players may “fade” or bet any amount up to the amount of the shooter’s bet. If they do not fade the shooter’s entire bet, the shooter must withdraw the portion not faded.


Players may also make side bets as to whether the shooter will roll a winning number or whether a certain combination will appear on the roll. , The outcomes are similar to bank craps.


If the come-out roll is a 7 or 11, the shooter wins money from the other players. The shooter can bet again and make another come-out roll, or retire by passing the dice to the player to his or her left.
If the come-out roll is 2, 3, or 12, the shooter loses the bet to the other players. The shooter again has the option to bet again or pass the dice to a new player.
If the come-out roll is anything else, that number becomes the point. The other players may then make additional bets as to whether the shooter will or won’t make the point.
 The outcomes are again similar to bank craps.


If the shooter makes the point, the shooter wins and may either bet and play another round or pass the dice.
If the shooter rolls a 7 (craps out), the shooter loses any money bet and must pass the dice to the next player.
If the shooter rolls anything else, the shooter rolls again until either making the point or crapping out. There is no “come point” as in bank craps.

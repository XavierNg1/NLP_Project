 Your state has determined that a meeting with the unemployment office is required for anyone claiming unemployment benefits.


The meeting is a way to offer job search assistance and information to help you apply for and secure a job. It also serves the purpose of addressing any concerns and verifying if you have already applied or plan to apply to any available positions.
Your meeting can either be with one or multiple unemployment counselors, so don't be nervous if you see multiple people in the room - this is normal.;
, This is a mandatory meeting. If you do not attend or do not reschedule, you may jeopardize your unemployment benefit. Since the letter states a predetermined date and time, it is understandable if you need to reschedule. To reschedule:


You can call the number provided on the letter and address any scheduling concerns with a representative. It is important not to cancel the meeting, but reschedule as soon as possible.
 Usually, you will be required to bring several documents of verification with you to the meeting. In order to verify what is required you can either review the information in your letter, call the unemployment office or search your state’s Department of Labor website for unemployment information. Possible documents include:


Photo ID.
Social Security Card.
Passport.
Birth Certificate.
 Write down any questions you may have about your job search, interview process or procedures with unemployment. For example, “Is there a website for local employers to post jobs?” A counselor will be happy to assist you.

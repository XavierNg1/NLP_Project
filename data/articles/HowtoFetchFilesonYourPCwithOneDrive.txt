 Open your web browser and go to OneDrive’s download page. Download the program for your Windows OS; it can be for Windows Vista, 7, or 8.


If you have Windows 8.1, it’s already built-in.;
, Double-click on the setup file and let the program install.


The setup file has a blue cloud icon with the filename (File) OneDriveSetup.exe.
You may find the setup file on your desktop or in your default Downloads folder.
 Before installation begins, you will have to sign in with your OneDrive or Microsoft account information. Enter the details on the fields provided.
 Continue clicking “Next” to install using the default, recommended settings.


Once done, you will see the OneDrive icon on the notification area at the right side of your taskbar.
It will begin downloading and syncing your OneDrive files to your computer.
 Before you leave for that long trip or business meeting, ensure that your PC is turned on, and leave it on. The PC must be up and running for Fetch to work.
 Check that the PC is connected to the Internet. Fetch will pass through the Internet in order to access your files in this PC. If the PC is not connected, it cannot access the files.
 Skip to the next step if OneDrive is already running on your PC; otherwise, open the OneDrive desktop application by looking for it in your Start Menu and clicking on it.


You can check if OneDrive is running by looking at the notification tray on the lower-right side of your screen. The application has an icon with white clouds on it. If the icon is there, then OneDrive is running.
Fetch needs the OneDrive desktop application running in order to get through your PC. It also serves as the layer of authorization and security. Otherwise, anybody can just access your files on your PC.
 Right-click the OneDrive icon found on the notification tray. Select “Settings” to open the program’s settings menu. Under the General section, look for the option “Let me use OneDrive to fetch any of my files on this PC,” and tick it to enable it.


This option needs to be enabled to notify OneDrive that you’re okay with the remote fetching feature.
 Click the “OK” button to save and exit the Settings menu.
 If you’re away from home and need to access files on your PC, just head to any available PC where you are located. Open a web browser and go to OneDrive’s website.


Any PC will do, and there’s no need to install the OneDrive desktop application on this other PC.
 Find the “Sign In” button and click on it. Use your OneDrive account or Microsoft account to sign in.
 Inside your OneDrive account online, go to the left panel menu and look for the PCs section. This section lists all the PCs with the OneDrive desktop application installed and running under your OneDrive account.
 If you have multiple PCs running the OneDrive desktop application, you will see several PC names here. Select the PC where the files you want to retrieve or fetch are located.
 As part of OneDrive’s efforts to secure your PC and your files there, it has this added layer of security check. Click on the “Sign in with a security code” link to begin the authentication process.
 As part of its verification process, it will ask you for your OneDrive account e-mail. Input your e-mail address in the appropriate field, and click the blue “Next” button. OneDrive will send your security code to this e-mail.


This e-mail address needs to match the one in OneDrive.
 Go to your e-mail client, sign in, and open your inbox. Look for the e-mail with the subject title “Microsoft account security code.” Open the e-mail and copy the security code.
 Go back to OneDrive’s page where you left off after entering your e-mail address. Input the code that you received in the e-mail into the field provided. Click the blue “Submit” button to proceed. OneDrive will verify your code.
 Once OneDrive has authenticated the code, you will now have a direct remote access to your computer’s folders and files. Your computer directory will appear in the different categories as how they’re structured in your PC.


Folders will appear in blue boxes.
 A single click on the blue folders will open them up. Continue your folder navigation by clicking on the folders. You will be able to see all your PC’s folders and files.
 Once you see the file you need to download from your PC, just click on it and it will start downloading onto your current PC. Once it’s on your current PC, you can view, edit, and work on it as any local file on that PC.
 If you don’t need to work on the file right away but would still like to access in on a later time from another PC or device, you can opt to upload the file to your OneDrive. This can be done remotely and directly:


Hover over the file you’d like to upload and tick on the check box that will appear on it.
On the header action menu, select “Upload to OneDrive.” Choose the destination of the file in your OneDrive directory and click the “Upload” button.
The file will start uploading to OneDrive. A progress bar will appear for you to monitor the upload.
 If you want to check a file’s properties without actually downloading it locally or uploading it to OneDrive, hover over the file and tick on the check box that will appear on it. On the header action menu, select “Properties.” The file’s properties will be displayed on a right panel on the same page.


The file type, date created, file path, and file size will be displayed.

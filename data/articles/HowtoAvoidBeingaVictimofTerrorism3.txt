 If a bomb explodes nearby and you are uninjured, head away from the site of the explosion. If a terrorist or group of terrorists is shooting into a crowd, look for an exit. If you can get to the exit without exposing yourself to greater danger, do so and keep running until you are far from the site of the terror incident., If you donâ€™t believe it is possible to escape from the terrorists, hide behind a large counter or beneath a table. Alternately, seek shelter in a secure room and lock the door. Look for areas that are reinforced with brick or other sturdy materials.Turn your phone off or on vibrate.
 If you can neither escape nor hide without exposing yourself to danger, rest on your stomach and play dead. Be very still and do not move. Do not attempt to help rescuers and do not pick up any weapons.If an opportunity presents itself, escape or hide.

 You don’t have to be confident but you do have to act confident. This will make people, girls included, take you seriously. Also, as we discuss below, girls think confidence is super attractive. Why would she want to like you if you don’t like yourself very much?


However, don’t be that guy that thinks he can do no wrong and that every word out of his mouth is a new book of the Bible. Admit when you’re wrong, always seek to improve yourself, and don’t act like you’re God’s gift to women. Don’t be a Captain Hammer. For that matter, try not to be a Doctor Horrible either.....at least with all the killing bits. That would be counter-productive.;
, Don’t feed the stereotype of nerds not taking care of their bodies. Like self confidence, if you can’t care about yourself enough to take care of yourself, how are you supposed to take care of someone else? Wash your body and hair regularly, wear clean clothes (without holes!), and brush your teeth. No Bowser breath here!

, Be a Nathan Drake. Be a Bruce Wayne. Be a Captain Picard. Be a guy who’s fun to be around, knows things, and makes the world and the people around him better because that's what girls really want. You don’t have to be the smartest guy, but be knowledgeable about the world around you. Help people by volunteering your time and being there for everyone you know. And get out there and do things! Even if it’s just going to cons, you have got to get out and live your life, not just sit around all day.


If you want to do something awesome and show the world (and the ladies) how great nerds can be, do work with nerdy charities like Child’s Play. This will go to a good cause and show people that nerds contribute to society in impactful, wonderful ways.
If you really want to get a girlfriend, take a lesson from the Patrick Stewart School of Awesome and respect the heck out of women. It turns out they really like that.

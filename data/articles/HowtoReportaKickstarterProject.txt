 Reporting a Kickstarter project is not as simple as reporting a photo or a user profile in most social networking sites. Reporting a project requires legal work. If you find a project that violates your copyright, gather any legal document or proof that you can get to prove your claim.;
, Open the page of the project you want to report. Scroll down the page and on the right hand side you’ll see a “Contact Me” button. Click this button and you should be able to send a message to the project creator.


Notify the makers about your legal concern and try to see if the problem can solved through a professional talk.
 If the creators refuses to take down their project even after you've stated your issue, consult a lawyer and ask for any legal action that you may take against those that violated your copyright.
 Create a new browser tab and open the Kickstarter Complaint form at https://www.kickstarter.com/help/forms/dmca/new.
 Select the radio button which best describes you as the complainant:



I am the copyright owner – Select this option if you have the legal right to file the report against the Kickstarter project.

I am an authorized representative of the copyright owner – If you are the legal spokesperson of the one who has the right to file the report against the Kickstarter project.

Your Name/Owner’s name
Your complete address and contact details
The URL of the Kickstarter project you like to report
A brief description of why you want to report it

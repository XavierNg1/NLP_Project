 Since you'll be dealing with raw poultry, gather everything you need before you begin trussing the chicken. That way you won't have to worry about finding supplies after you've already touched it. You'll need the following equipment:


A cutting board
3 feet (0.9Â m) of kitchen twine or string
A scissors
A roasting pan

, Remove any giblets, organs or neck pieces from inside the chicken's cavity. These can be discarded or set aside for later use. Rinse the chicken's outer surface and inner cavity. Pat it dry with paper towels, inside and out, before you begin the trussing process.


If you plan to stuff the chicken, go ahead and stuff it before you start the trussing process.
Wait to season the chicken until after it has been trussed.

 The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the side lengths of a right triangle, and c{\displaystyle c} equals the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).Make sure you don’t confuse the height of the cone with the slant height, which is the diagonal distance from the top vertex of the cone to the edge of the base.The height is the perpendicular distance between the top vertex to the base., You will use the radius and height of the cone as the two sides of a right triangle. Substitute the radius for the variable a{\displaystyle a} and the height for the variable b{\displaystyle b}.

For example, if the radius of a cone is 5 cm and the height is 12 cm, your formula will look like this: 52+122=c2{\displaystyle 5^{2}+12^{2}=c^{2}}.
 Remember that squaring a number means to multiply it by itself.

For example:52+122=c2{\displaystyle 5^{2}+12^{2}=c^{2}}25+144=c2{\displaystyle 25+144=c^{2}}169=c2{\displaystyle 169=c^{2}}


, This will give you the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle, which is equal to the the slant height of the cone.For example:169=c2{\displaystyle 169=c^{2}}169=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {169}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}13=c{\displaystyle 13=c}So, the slant height of the cone is 13 cm.
 The formula is SA=(π)(r)(s)+(π)(r2){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=(\pi )(r)(s)+(\pi )(r^{2})}, where SA{\displaystyle {\text{SA}}} equals the surface area of the cone, r{\displaystyle r} equals the length of the radius of the cone’s base, and s{\displaystyle s} equals the slant height of the cone.The total surface area of a cone is equal to the sum of the lateral surface area ((π)(r)(s){\displaystyle (\pi )(r)(s)}) and the base area ((π)(r2){\displaystyle (\pi )(r^{2})}, since the base of a cone is a circle).
 The radius should be given, and you already calculated the slant height. Make sure you use the slant height in the surface area formula, not the (perpendicular) height. If you are not using a calculator, use 3.14 for π{\displaystyle \pi }

For example, for a cone with a radius of 5 cm and a slant height of 13 cm, your formula will look like this: SA=(3.14)(5)(13)+(3.14)(52){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=(3.14)(5)(13)+(3.14)(5^{2})}.
 Then, add these products together. The sum will give you the total surface area of the cone in square units.

For example:SA=(3.14)(5)(13)+(3.14)(52){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=(3.14)(5)(13)+(3.14)(5^{2})}SA=204.1+(3.14)(25){\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=204.1+(3.14)(25)}SA=204.1+78.5{\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=204.1+78.5}SA=282.6{\displaystyle {\text{SA}}=282.6}So, the surface area of a cone with a radius of 5 cm and a height of 12 cm is 282.6 square centimeters.

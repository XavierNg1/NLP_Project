 An all-silver color scheme keeps things simple and elegant.


It works best if your dress is a light, shimmering hue of silver.
You should also try to match the hue of your accessories to the hue of your dress.
Stick with delicate, dainty jewelry and simple silver heels with little adornment, emphasizing the simplicity of this option.;
, This creates another elegant, classy look, but one with more variety and visual interest.


Look for two-toned jewelry that mixes gold and silver. Each piece should have a two-toned element for the sake of consistency.
 These tones are a little less feminine and more masculine, so you can get away with bulkier jewelry and accessories if you go this route. You could even consider black leather bracelets and heavier black heels or boots to create the edgy look. This results in an overall bolder look.
 Colors are a versatile option and can either look elegant or bold. Just stick with cool hues.


Blues and blue-tinted shades of purple or turquoise work best.
Avoid warm colors, since these are more likely to clash with the cold tone of a silver dress.

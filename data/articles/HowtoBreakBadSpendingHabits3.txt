 Late fees and interest can add up, reducing your income substantially. Get in the habit of paying your bills before they are due. If necessary, set up text or email reminders for those expenses you pay online, such as credit card bills and utilities.Automating as much bill payment as possible is ideal. You’ll never see the money, and never be tempted to spend it before you pay your bills.
 You might be losing quite a bit of money when you cash your check, especially if you cash at a payday lender. Many places charge up to 10% of the amount of the check.Instead of using payday lenders, you should open a checking account. Visit a local bank or credit union.
If you can’t get a checking account, try to cash your check at the bank that issued the check.
 When you’re short on money, do you take funds out of your retirement savings? Many people do, and you need to break this bad habit.Your retirement savings are for retirement, not current expenses.


Break this habit by building an emergency savings fund. Try to save up to six months of expenses. Once you meet that goal, save up for 12 months of expenses. You can tap your emergency fund when your car breaks down or you lose your job.
Start small, by putting aside whatever you can afford, such as $5 a pay period. After a couple months, try to increase your contribution to $10 a pay period. Use direct deposit so you never touch the money.,


Popular culture is full of images of happy, wealthy people. You rarely see a working-class or even middle-class person anymore. Turn off the TV and cancel your magazine subscriptions so that you aren’t seduced into equating wealth with happiness.
 After you break your bad spending habits, commit to saving more money. Wake up earlier in the morning and use the free time to earn money by writing blogs or walking your neighbor’s dog around the block.

 The most effective way to avoid electrical problems is to reduce energy consumption by choosing non-electric decor. For example, this may mean swapping out a plug-in Santa figurine that lights up and sings for a festive arrangement of candles.;
, In cases where you do want to use electric decorations (such as strings of lights), you can reduce the risk of electrical problems by minimizing their quantity. For example, you could hang a simple and elegant string of lights along your home's eaves, rather than tracing the outlines of windows and doors as well.
 A third way to reduce energy consumption is to replace old incandescent strings of lights with much more efficient LED lights. LED lights draw much less energy and also generate less heat, reducing the risk of electrical overload and fire. LED lights also last much longer than incandescent lights.
 It can often be tempting to string holiday lights together end-to-end from the same outlet. However, this puts enormous stress on a single circuit in your home. Instead, try to plug electric decorations in throughout your home, spreading the load across several circuits.
 Holiday lights that are used repeatedly each year, especially ones that are hung outdoors, are subjected to a large amount of wear. Strings of lights with frayed or torn insulation should be replaced promptly, as exposed conductors drastically increase the risk of short circuits and fire.
 Heat sources, especially open flames, pose the risk of melting wire insulation and leading to electrical fires or other problems. Avoid stringing holiday lights across your fireplace mantle, for example. Also, keep electric decorations a safe distance away from candles, stoves, and heaters.
 The heat generated from lights hung on a Christmas tree can pose a risk of fire. This risk is increased substantially if the tree is dehydrated, so make sure that your tree is positioned in a stable base filled with water. Regularly check the level of water in the base.

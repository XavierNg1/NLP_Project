 Slowly add water to a bowl of baking soda and mix it until a thick paste forms. You don't want this paste to be too runny. It should be thick.
 Put paste on top of the stain. The stain should be completely covered by a layer of paste. Put a paper towel on top of the area to keep moisture in. , Leave the stain alone for at least an hour, but preferably several.It will take some time for the baking soda to lift the stain out of the laminate.
 Without scrubbing, gently wipe the laminate surface clean.Baking soda can be abrasive so you don't want to scrub and potentially leave micro-scratches on the surface.Most of the time, this should take care of your stain.
 If any stain remains, it can usually be addressed by using a solvent like paint thinner or nail polish remover.Apply one of these and gently scrub with a soft towel.


Be sure to use a white cloth or towel - the solvent could cause the colors to bleed!

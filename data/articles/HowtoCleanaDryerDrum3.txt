 Start by running the dryer for 10 minutes. This will soften the lipstick and make it easier to remove. You can alternatively use a hairdryer to heat up the specific spot which is being affected. This may be easier and more efficient to do.
 With the drum hot, wipe the lipstick with a soft, dry cloth. Switch which part of the cloth you wipe with frequently, to keep from spreading the lipstick any more.


You can also try using a makeup wipe to remove the lipstick.
 Unplug the dryer and then soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol. Use this to wipe off the remaining lipstick. When you've removed as much of it as you can, rinse with a wet rag or paper towels.
 With the dryer rinsed out, run a load of old towels through a cycle in the dryer to remove any product which might still remain.

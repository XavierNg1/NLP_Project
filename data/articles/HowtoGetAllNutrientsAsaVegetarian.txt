 Vegetarians should keep all options open when choosing which foods to eat. Trying new vegetables, grains and legumes gives opportunities to enjoy unfamiliar foods that can replace and usually exceed the nutritional content of animal-based foods.;
, Healthy vegetarians avoid processed foods. Study vegetarian cookbooks with simple recipes that include a variety of vegetables, grains, nuts, legumes, fruits and healthy fats. Eating at home lets you control the nutrients you consume.
 Most vitamins found in a meat-based diet can be obtained by eating vegetables such as leafy greens, which contain calcium. Consuming different types of vegetables ensures that you're acquiring the different nutrients available in each plant.


Try consuming at least 9 servings of vegetables and fruits daily for optimal nutrient intake. Consider trying dark leafy greens, cooked tomatoes and the most brightly colored vegetables in red, orange and yellow hues.
 Many meats contain important proteins that are also found in dairy products, fish and eggs, such as Vitamin B-12 and calcium. Vegetarians who eat some animal-based products normally get adequate amounts of proteins. However strict vegans who abstain from all animal products must consume additional plant foods such as tempeh or whole grain-based cereals to ensure adequate vegetarian nutrition.
 Reach for unprocessed snack foods and meals when you're rushed. Instead of turning to sugary sweets and fried meals, eat high-fiber foods such as fruit, brown rice crackers and peanut butter. You'll feel full and meet dietary requirements when on the go.
 Plant-based diets contain enough nutrition for vegetarians who eat some animal products, but strict vegans may find supplements beneficial if affected by lethargy and a weak immune system. B-12 and zinc supplements can help improve the status of a vegan's health and nutrition status.

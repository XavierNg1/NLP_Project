 Again, the exact width is up to you, but 3/4" is a good, workable thickness. Measure out each strip of wood on the walnut, maple, and cherry boards with your pencil.









You want the strips to run lengthwise along each board -- you'll then alternate strips from each type of wood to build the final cutting board.
 Working slowly, cut along your pencil lines. You should end up with three sets of perfectly even strips of wood. They look like square posts.









The number of strips you end up with will depend on the starting width of your wood.
You can play with or adapt this formula -- cutting different widths to get a variable striping on your final board -- if you want.
 The easiest style is to alternate -- cherry, maple, walnut, cherry, maple, walnut, cherry... etc. Rotate the strips so that the nicest side is facing up, and place the wood into a "dry cut" of the final cutting board.
 You'll be using wood glue to adhere the wood strips to each other, so turn each piece over so that the side you'll be gluing faces upward.
 Use your fingers or a brush to apply glue to one side of every strip of wood. You want glue covering the entire side. Don't worry about dripping or excess glue now -- you'll clean it up later.
 Rotate the wood back counter-clockwise so that the glue sides are between each piece of wood. Line them up and press them together, making sure they don't buckle or slide.
 This is necessary to help the wood glue dry appropriately. Make sure, as you apply the clamps, that the wood stays level. No pieces should "buckle" or push upwards. Ensure that the bottom or top is roughly even as well.
 Lift the cutting board vertical and let it dry for the recommended time on the wood glue bottle.









This should take 1-3 hours, but check the bottle for specifics.

 You’ll need pieces of sturdy timber to construct your boxes. Make sure the wood has been pressure treated or preservative has been applied to it. This will help your garden box to last longer.


If you are using reclaimed wood such as railway sleepers, check that they are plant safe. Some wood can be contaminated with chemicals that will negatively affect plants.
 These kits consist of pre-measured lengths of wood and all the fixings you need to fit them together. The kit also may only include just the fixings.


If you purchase only the fixings, you’ll need to source the wood yourself.
 If the planks aren’t wide enough to provide enough depth to the boxes, you may wish to double up and make your box out of two planks stacked together on each side.
 If you aren’t using a kit, you’ll need to source your own fittings. You can either use chunky posts, which will sit within the boxes so that you can nail into them at right angles, or metal fixings such as right angled brackets. Get four (or eight, if stacking planks to make a deeper box) of whatever fixing you use.


You’ll also need some nails to fit your fittings, and a drill or manual screwdriver.
 You can also make garden boxes using bricks or construction blocks. You can also repurpose old items to make garden boxes. These include old bed frames or furniture such as wooden chests of drawers. You may need to drill drainage holes in some of these repurposed items. You can purchase woven willow walls or use metal sheeting, sandbags or logs to make the walls of your garden box.


Just make sure that whatever you use is water resistant.
Wooden items will probably need to be treated with wood preservative to prolong their life in the garden.

 Take the location of your proposed knot and bend the rope back on itself. You should have both sides of rope running parallel to each other with a bend at the end. This bend is called a "bight.", This, again, is almost identical to a basic overhand knot. This time, however, you're working with two ropes at once instead of one.


The portion of the rope that rests there as you create a knot is called the "standing" rope.
 Take the bight from under the standing ropes and pull it into the loop. You'll end up curling your bight over the parallel ropes, keeping the shape of the loop intact.
 This knot can quickly turn into a mess as it pulls tight. Tighten it about halfway, then use your fingers to massage the knot into something cleaner and more secure. You want to eliminate spots where the ropes split, instead aiming for clean sets of parallel ropes throughout.
 This will create your final overhand knot. Make any last adjustments to clean the knot and you're on your way.
 This knot can be made anywhere in the rope, meaning it can help pin segments of rope between two small openings. It can also be used to provide a hand-hold if you need to yank hard on a rope and don't have a good grip.

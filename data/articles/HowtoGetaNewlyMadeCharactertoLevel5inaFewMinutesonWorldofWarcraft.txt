 This will help you finish off the quests faster. Don't worry; this can be done very easily in starting areas. For example, gather 1 quest that requires you to kill X mobs, 1 quest that requires you to loot Y objects you find on those mobs, and 1 quest that requires you to gather some stuff that can be found in nature (not on mobs). After you complete all of them, go report those quests.;
, Level up to 2 by grinding, since you have to kill a very small number of mobs to level up. Start with mobs of higher level (3 and so).
 This will ensure that you defeat mobs easily. As soon as you can learn a new one, rush to the trainer.
 Avoid melee fights at any cost. Most mobs can't attack from range; that is a huge advantage to you. Enhance your ranged attacks as much as you can (i.e. buy better ranged weapons). Make sure the mob is dead before it comes close enough for them to attack you.
 Although it's not advisable to do this at higher levels, when you are below level 20 you must loot everything you find. Sell the junk to the vendor and gain some extra coppers and maybe even silvers.

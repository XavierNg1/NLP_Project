 Offer to do the same for them.


If the game has already started, politely ask the other players in between conversations to leave you feedback at the end of the game and you will do the same thing for them.;
, Avoid trash talking in general. If you kill someone in a first-person shooter, don't let the world know by shouting "YES! YOU NOOB I JUST PWNED YOU!" Keep your comments to yourself and be friendly and helpful.
 Whether you ranked last, or you completely pwned the other player(s), you should be polite. You can replace "Good Game" with "gg" or "GG", though this tends to take the meaningfulness out of the statement.


If you absolutely cannot say good game, then leave the game. It's better than trash talking, and making people leave bad feedback about you.
 Don't confuse this with leaving negative feedback. For example, you might say something along the lines of "Nice playing with you. You're pretty good", but not "Man, you sucked really bad!!"

 For some vehicles it is considered okay to use electrical contact cleaner in your ignition. However, if your model has a high security key, it is not safe to do so. If you are unsure what kind of key you have do not use electrical contact cleaner.Instead, try using compressed air., Spraying small amounts at a time is the best method here.Whether you are using compressed air or electrical contact cleaner, you shouldnâ€™t blast it into your cylinder all at once.
 This will help remove any dirt, lint, or other debris stuck in your cylinder.Do this several times in between puffs of air or electrical contact cleaner to clear out your cylinder and clean you key.
 Once you have sprayed out the cylinder and put the key in and out several times, try turning it. You should never force the key to turn, as this can damage the key and the cylinder.

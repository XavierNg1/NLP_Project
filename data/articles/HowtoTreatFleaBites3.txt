 For some reason, fleas don't relish the taste of garlic. So prepare a your favorite Italian dish, or make Moules Marinieres, and sop up all that garlicky goodness with some garlic bread. Don't give any garlic to your dogs, however, as garlic is toxic to them.
 Fleas dislike citrus smells. Slice a lemon into thin pieces, add it to some water and heat to a boiling point. Let it sit overnight and, in the morning, spray it onto areas where you suspect fleas hang out (the ankles and the arms especially). This should help prevent future flea bites and make you smell nice in the bargain!

, Several essential oils help ward off fleas because of their strong smell. Use this to your advantage. Create tinctures or mix the essential oil directly onto your skin for relief from fleas.


Use eucalyptus oil on problem areas. Eucalyptus oil is another offensive smell for fleas. Take a little bit of eucalyptus oil, mix it into a spray bottle with some water, and spray onto ankles and arms.
Use lavender oil on problem areas. Lavender oil, like eucalyptus oil, is offensive to fleas. Apply as you might eucalyptus oil.
Use cedarwood oil on problem areas. Alternately, sprinkle a few cedar chips in your pillow, at the base of your bed, etc. to discourage the fleas from living in the area.

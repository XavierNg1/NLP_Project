 Draw a large circle (the body) and then a smaller circle on top of it (the head). Make sure that the two circles overlap a bit. Draw a light line halfway through the head.;
, On the sides of the body, draw two "C" shapes. These will be the feet. In the middle, draw small circles for the pads of his feet.
 Add two small "C" shapes on the sides of the head for his ears. Just below the halfway line that you drew in step 1, draw two tiny ovals as eyes. Below the eyes, draw a circle for the snout, overlapping it a tiny bit on the body. Draw a smaller half-circle at the top of the snout. This is his nose.
 On the sides of his body, draw two lines going down to the feet (the arms). On the left side, draw a circle for his hand. On the right side, leave it as-is.
 Add fuzz and fur around his body, then draw his eyebrows about 1 centimeter (0.4Â in) above his eyes. Draw a patch just below his right eyebrow. Draw a stitching line in the middle of his body, then draw another patch to the right of that.
 Erase all of the guidelines and colour him in. Now you have your own Tatty Teddy!

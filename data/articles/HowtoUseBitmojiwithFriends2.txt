 If you use Slack at the office or at home, you can spruce up your chats with Bitmoji. Slack will even design “Friendmoji,” which are cartoon creations starring you and another Slack user who uses Bitmoji.

You’ll need to be a Slack user to use this method.
If you’re not already signed in to your Slack team, click Log In to sign in now.
 It’s the large button near the top of the screen., This gives Bitmoji permission to post to your Slack chats., You should see a message that says “Welcome to Bitmoji for Slack!”,

If you already have a Bitmoji account and avatar, click Connect Your Bitmoji Account instead, then log into Bitmoji.
 If you already have a Bitmoji you can skip this step. Otherwise:

Click Sign Up for Bitmoji. It’s at the top-right corner of the screen.
Enter your name, email address, and a password.
Click Sign Up.
 Again, if you were already a Bitmoji user, you can skip this step. Otherwise, follow the on-screen prompts to personalize your cartoon avatar.

Start by selecting a gender (Male or Female).
Choose a Bitmoji or Bitstrips-style avatar. Bitmoji avatars are more cartoonish and less detailed. Bitstrips-style is more detailed and less cartoonlike.
Click your desired face shape, then click the right-pointing arrow at the top-right corner of the screen to move to the next step. Continue selecting features and then clicking the arrow until you see “Wow, looking great!”
Click Save Avatar. Your Bitmoji is ready to use.
 Replace “” with an emotion (e.g. angry), greeting (e.g. hello), or situation (e.g. winning).
Type /bitmoji @user to add a Friendmoji featuring both you and another user. Replace “” with an action (e.g. lunch), greeting (e.g. good morning), or situation (e.g. can’t deal). Remember, the person you tag (“@user”) must also be using Bitmoji.

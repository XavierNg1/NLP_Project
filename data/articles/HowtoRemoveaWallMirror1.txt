 Cutout wire, also called windshield removal wire, is a high-strength braided steel wire that is used by auto body shops to repair windshields. It can be purchased from auto part stores either by itself or as part of a kit that includes convenient handles on either end of the wire. You will be working the wire between the mirror and the drywall, so you need a length of wire longer than the diagonal dimension of your mirror.;
, Doing this will minimize the amount of shards that will go flying in case the mirror breaks. Even if you plan to salvage the mirror for later use, this step is a necessary safety precaution. The tape's adhesive can be removed later with a solvent.
 Begin by stretching the wire tight and sliding it between the mirror and the drywall in any corner. Wiggle the wire back and forth to wedge it behind the mirror.
 Once the wire is wedged behind the mirror, work it towards the opposite corner. Using a slight back-and-forth sawing motion can keep the wire from getting stuck. As you work the wire towards the other corner, it will cut through the adhesive joining the mirror to the wall. It is strongly advised to have another person hold the mirror steady while you do this, so that it doesn't suddenly come loose.
 Once the cutout wire has sliced through most of the adhesive, you should be able to lift the mirror away from the wall. This process is likely to tear away some of the drywall paper, so expect to have to repair the wall later.

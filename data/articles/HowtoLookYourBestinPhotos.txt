This allows you to show your face and body in a "semi-profile", which is very flattering., Nobody looks good when they are miserable. You've probably been told to say "cheese", but this can make a smile look more like a grimace. For a natural, gentle smile that is easy to maintain, push your tongue against the back of your top teeth.


Open your eyes wide (not too wide or you'll look startled or slightly crazy). Don't stare directly into the camera,as this may result in your eyes looking red in the photograph. Direct your gaze slightly above the camera.

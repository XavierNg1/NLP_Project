 Like picture hanging strips, adhesive hooks and nails require clean surfaces, so wipe down the wall with a clean cloth and isopropyl alcohol, then let it dry.


Adhesive hooks or nails have adhesive backings that stick to walls, so that you can mount pictures using the hanging hardware attached to the picture. Depending on the hardware on your picture, make sure you purchase the appropriate adhesive hanging equipment.
 Remove the liner from the adhesive strip and affix it to the hook or nail.


Some adhesive hooks come with the adhesive already affixed to the back. Skip this step and move on to the next if that’s the case with the adhesive hook you have.
 First, remove the liner from the back of the adhesive that’s attached to your hook or nail. In the place where you want your picture hung, firmly press the adhesive hook or nail against the wall for 30 seconds., When the hour is up, hang your pictures normally based on the hanging hardware installed.


Make sure you know the weight of your picture before you purchase adhesive nails, as they generally only hold between five and eight pounds (2.26 and 3.6 kg), while smaller hooks may only hold one or two pounds (0.45 or 0.9 kg).
To hang a picture that’s heavier than what your adhesive nails or hooks are rated for, use more than one. Ensure the weight gets distributed evenly by using a level during installation.

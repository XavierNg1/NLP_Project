 Though it may be best to let the diarrhea run its course so your body can get rid of the bacteria causing the diarrhea, you can also take medication to help slow down your diarrhea. Pepto-Bismol can be found over-the-counter at your local pharmacy. It has mild antibacterial effects and slows down your diarrhea. Follow the label instructions for dosage information.
 Psyllium fiber can help to soak up water in your intestines and make your stool more firm.


Adults can have 2.5 to 30 grams (0.09 to 1 oz) a day in a divided dose. You can take psyllium when you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Children six to 11 years old can have 1.25 to 15 grams (0.044 to 0.53 oz) a day orally in divided doses.
 Sometimes chronic diarrhea can be caused by medications you are already taking for other medical issues. You may want to speak to your doctor and review your medications to see if they are causing the chronic diarrhea. Your doctor may suggest changing your medication or reducing the dosage.

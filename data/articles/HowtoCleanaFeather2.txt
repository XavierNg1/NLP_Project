 Squeeze a small amount of mild dish detergent (like Dawn) or mild laundry detergent (like Woolite) into the bucket. Use your hand or a spoon to agitate the water and mix the ingredients together.
 Add your feathers to the bucket of solution and gently swish them through the water. Avoid any kind of scrubbing, which will damage the feathers. Continue to swish until the feathers appear clean.
 Fill a new bucket with clean water. Take the feathers out of the cleaning solution, one at a time, and swish them gently through the clean water to rinse away the soap residue. If you’re rinsing a lot of feathers, you may need to dump the bucket and refill it with fresh water once or twice.
 Once rinsed, place the clean feathers out flat on paper towels. Set a regular hair dryer to its lowest setting. Pick up one or two of the feathers at a time. Hold them by the quills and gently blow air on them until they are completely dry.








Don’t hold the feather right up to the blow dryer’s stream. Hold them a few inches back so you won’t warp their natural shape.

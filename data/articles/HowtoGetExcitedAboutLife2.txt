 We live and then we die. That is a thought with many implications. One exciting implication is that your life is a rare thing; it is an opportunity to make the most of it; life is a thing that should not be wasted.
 Imagine all the things you can do with the time you have. Put down on paper 5 things you want to accomplish in life. Imagining all the ways you might live your life can be an exciting thought.
 If you're feeling bored because you're stuck in the same routine, then change it up! There are a number of changes you can make that range from big to small.


Small changes include things like ordering something different off the menu rather than getting the same thing all the time when you go out to eat.
Large changes include taking a new job, moving to a new city, doing an exchange program for a year to immerse yourself in another culture.
 There are so many interacting parts, almost anything could happen theoretically. Who knows, you may run into a celebrity whose movies you enjoy, find a ten dollar bill on the ground, or bump into an old friend. The possibilities are endless!

, Sometimes we get so caught up in trying to get ahead in life that we forget to give ourselves breaks. Remind yourself that taking breaks to play and have fun is a very healthy thing to do.There are a number of ways to play; find the one that is funnest for you:


Play a video game; don't worry about whether it seems childish or dorky, just enjoy the experience - get immersed in it.
Play a board game with friends. Invite some pals over and
Play sports. Join a friendly sports league and foster some friendly competition.

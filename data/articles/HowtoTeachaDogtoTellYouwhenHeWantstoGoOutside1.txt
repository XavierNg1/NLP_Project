 Make sure the bell is within the dog's reach and is loud enough that you will hear it even if you are not in the same room. It's also important that it be durable enough that your dog won't break it.You can also use a wireless doorbell, as long as your dog will be able to push to button.If your dogs seems afraid of the sound of the bell, try dampening it with some tape to make it quieter. Then get your dog used to it by ringing it a lot and slowly removing the dampening device. Once the dog is no longer bothered by the sound, you can proceed with the training.;
, Before you take your dog outside each time, gently lift his paw and help him ring the bell. Then let him out right away. Continue doing this for several weeks until your dog learns to ring the bell himself.If your dog is not particularly motivated by the outdoors, give him a treat as you let him out to help reinforce the training.If your dog is still learning to go to the bathroom outside, be sure to reward him when he does that too.
 Once your dog is trained to ring the bell, be sure to respond to him when he does by letting him outside. If you fail to let him out when he rings the bell, he will get confused and may stop doing it.Continue rewarding your dog with treats for ringing the bell for several weeks, if not longer.

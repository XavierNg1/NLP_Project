 For LaserJet printers, the printer rollers can usually be found near the paper tray – which is often located on the top of the machine. If you can’t find them here, try opening the access panel. They may be on top here, or underneath the toner cartridge, which you can easily remove.Some LaserJet printer rollers don’t rotate manually. This means that you’ll need to unsnap the clips on either side of the roller and then remove the roller.
 Dip a cotton swab in alcohol and use it to clean your LaserJet printer rollers. Gently rub it over the surface of your printer rollers. Wipe the rollers off and dry them completely before reinstalling them in your printer.Make sure the cotton swab is just moistened with alcohol and not dripping wet. You don’t want an excess of the liquid getting inside the LaserJet printer.
 Dip a lint-free cloth into some distilled water and gently scrub the surface of your printer rollers to remove any dirt or debris that has caught on the rollers. This will help clean the rollers without drying them out or damaging them in any way.Be sure to dry the rollers completely before reinstalling them in your printer.

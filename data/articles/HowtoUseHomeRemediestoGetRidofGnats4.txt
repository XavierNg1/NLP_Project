 Mix 2 Tbsp (30 ml) lemon-scented liquid dish soap with 1 gallon (4 liters) of water in a spray bottle.


Alternatively, you could just add a few drops of dish soap to the water you use to water your plants.
If you do not have lemon-scented dish soap, just about any other type will also work. Avoid dish soaps with too many harsh chemicals, however, since these may damage the plant.
 Spray soil, leaves, and stems of infested plants with the soapy water.


The soap should kill the gnats, rather than merely driving them away.
 After an hour or so passes, mist the leaves and stem of the plant with clean water to rinse the soap off.


If you do not perform this step, the soap could gradually cause harm to the plant.

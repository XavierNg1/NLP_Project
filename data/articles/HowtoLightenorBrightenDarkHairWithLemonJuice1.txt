 Slice your lemon in half. If you have a hand juicer, you can use it to speed up this step, otherwise simply squeezing the lemon by hand works fine. Over a cup or other container, squeeze the lemon until all of the juice is thoroughly drained. You may accidentally get a few seeds in your cup, but that’s OK.;
, Because lemon juice is acidic, you run the risk of damaging your hair if you apply it directly.Instead, create a mixture of one part lemon juice three parts water.You can add the water directly to the cup, or make it even easier by combining both ingredients in a clean, empty spray bottle. This will make applying it to your hair even easier. Stir or shake the lemon juice and water together.
 If you are using a spray bottle, you can spritz it throughout your tresses or focus on the top layer to get sun-kissed highlights. If your lemon juice and water is in a cup, use a pastry brush or hair color brush to apply the mixture wherever you’d like to lighten. You can focus on your ends for a gentle ombre effect, or paint the mixture in streaks for highlights. If you have enough mixture, you can coat your entire head of hair in it!

, Think of sunlight as the lemon juice activator. When your lemon juice-coated hair warms up in the sun, the lemon juice opens the cuticle and fades pigment.Apply this treatment to your hair every time you know you’ll be spending a few hours outside, and watch as your hair gradually lightens!

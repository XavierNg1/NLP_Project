 Black spot has the following indicators:


Circular black spots with fringed margins on the leaves.
The lower leaves tend to be infected first, after which it spreads quickly.
Upper leaves often turn yellow and fall off.
The plant becomes weaker and it either blooms less or not at all.
 This helps to slow down any further progression of the fungus.


Clean up and safely dispose of black spot infected leaves that have fallen to the ground immediately. If left to lie below a rose, the spores of the fungi will start climbing the rose again as soon as the temperature and moisture are right in the spring.
 Even without signs of black spot, this is an important part of good rose preventative maintenance. Fungicides include trifloxystrobin, Ziram, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, Thiophanate-methyl, and several others. For advice on an appropriate spray or powder for your local area, discuss directly with your local garden center.
 In severe cases black spots can be seen on the stems of the roses. Be sure that these are removed as quickly as they are noticed.

 Hammer them in sideways in random areas around the tube. Hammer in at least 15 or so nails for best effect.
 Tape a piece of cardboard or another sturdy cover over the bottom of the tube.
 Pour in some rice, sand, dried beans, beads, popcorn kernels, and other small objects that will make the sound of rain.
 Add a second cover to the top of the rain stick, and tape it down.
 You could also decorate it with paint or stickers.
 Tip it from side to side to hear the sound of falling rain.

 Once you hit it enough, you should see the driver. Shoot at the driver with the 50 cal or missile.
 Ask a teammate to escort you up a hill, set up your artillery and build a box around it. Howitzers can shoot through those so don't worry.
 I get in a self-propelled gun, heavy tank, or light tank with AA and armor piercing shells. Find a big ball of bushes, believe me, they are easy to find, and park in it, but MAKE SURE NOBODY CAN SEE YOU! If you do this right, you can kill tons of helicopters very easily, and have a hidden bombardment system to decimate the enemy. But the enemy will probably find you if they hit you or you are seen firing through the bush. If you are attacked by an enemy heavy tank or are found, try to retreat or find high ground to fire off of.

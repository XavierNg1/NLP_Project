 To get ready to do scissor jumps, make sure you've spent a few minutes warming up, then stand at the end of an exercise mat with your arms by your sides and your feet about hip-width apart., To get a handle on this exercise, it's a good idea to practice your leg movements first, then work the arm movements in to complete the exercise. You're going to hop one leg towards the far end of the mat, then reverse that movement and hop the other leg forward.You're not really moving forward with this exercise, you're moving your legs back and forth to imitate scissors. Try to keep your legs straight and extended, without bending your knees, so they look like the blades of a pair of scissors.
 Maybe just a foot apart at first, then gradually increase the distance between your feet as you improve your balance. Smaller hops can also help to prevent injuries if this is a concern. It is important to build up your strength and balance before doing a move like this that can be hard on the knees.
 Once you've got your legs going correctly, add your arms to the mix. When you hop your right leg forward, swing your right arm backwards.Your legs and arms should be doing opposite motions, so as your left arm goes forward your right arm goes back, at the same time, your right leg goes forward (with your left arm) as your left leg (with your right arm) goes back.
 Set a timer for 30 or 60 seconds and do as many scissor jumps back and forth as you can during that time. Keep moving for the entire length of the interval.

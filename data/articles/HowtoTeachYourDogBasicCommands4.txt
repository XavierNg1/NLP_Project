 The "come" command is also known as "recall." Like training for other basic commands, begin with your dog in "sit" position., You should do this in a more encouraging voice than you use for other commands, as you want the dog to want to come to you. Accompany the command with a gesture to show the dog what you want.
 Once you have shown your dog how to come and what command you will give, place a piece of dry dog food at your feet and point to it. After a very short time, the gesture of pointing at the floor in front of you should be enough. Later only the command or the gesture will be needed.
 When your dog reaches you, praise it using the phrase "Good come!" Give him or her a nice pet on the head, showing the dog that you are appreciative of what it just did for you., When interacting with your pet, take opportunities to call it from across the room by using its name and saying "Come!" and praising it when it gets there. This will make your dog familiar with the command.

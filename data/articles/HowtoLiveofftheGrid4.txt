There are countless videos and articles online about how to live off the grid. Alternately, visit your local library and check out some books on how to live off the grid, grow fruits and vegetables, and manage your solar array., Renting a cabin in a rural, isolated place might provide you with a taste of what you can expect when living off the grid.

Spend a week or so in one that most closely approximates the sort of home you plan on living in.While the amenities and features of a particular cabin might not be exactly the same as those that you’ll include when moving off the grid, spending time in such a cabin could help you better determine what you’re looking for.
Use the experience to decide the location, size, and amenities of your off-grid homestead.

 You'll find it in the "TV/Video Services" section of your PS3's menu. If you are having problems logging into Netflix because someone else's account is on it, you can reset the app using this method., You'll need to start holding these buttons as soon as you load the app. After a moment, a message will appear asking "Do you want to reset your Netflix settings and re-register?"

If the message does not appear and Netflix opens, you'll need to close the app and try again.
 This will remove the account that is currently associated with the app and reset it. You'll be prompted to log in or start a trial when you launch the Netflix app next.

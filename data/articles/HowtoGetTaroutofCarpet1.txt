 After the tar stain forms, blot it immediately with a paper towel. Instead of rubbing, pat at the stain using gentle dabbing motions to lift the tar.Be sure to blot only the stained area to avoid spreading the tar to clean areas of carpet.
Make sure to start blotting at the stain as soon as it forms. Keep blotting until no more tar is lifted.;
, A powerful way to remove fresh tar is to freeze and harden it so that it’s easy to scrape off. To freeze the tar, hold an ice cube against the stained area of carpet for at least a minute.After about a minute, touch the tar and feel whether it has hardened. If it has not, hold the ice cube against the stain until the tar has fully hardened.
 After you have finished freezing the tar, use a butter knife or spoon to scrape up any tar that may have hardened into the fibers of the carpet. Because the tar has frozen, the tar should come off in crumbles.Try not to be too rough as you scrape, as this can damage the carpet further.
Scraping and blotting should have reduced a significant amount of the stain, but it’s likely that you will need to use a cleaning solvent to get rid of the entire stain.

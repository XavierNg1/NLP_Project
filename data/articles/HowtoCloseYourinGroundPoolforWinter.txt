 You have to ensure that your water pH, alkalinity and calcium hardness are all balanced. This will actually protect the surface of the pool from etching and straining.

Add a winterizing chemical kit to your water. This will help keep it blue and clean for the next season.
Make sure to follow the instruction enclosed with the kit that was provided by the manufacturer.
Do not make use of a floater that has a strong oxidizer. This will make the floater stick against the wall and stain or perhaps bleach your wall.
For similar reasons, you must not also throw chlorine or bromine tablets in the pool. They will actually sink to the bottom and thus, will damage the surface of the pool.;
, This will actually get the water out of throat of the skimmer which may easily damage if water were to freeze in there.

Another option is to actually put an Aquador on the mouth of the skimmer. An Aquador is a plastic dam that will hold out the water from the skimmer which will allow you to leave the water level up for the winter. This will help when it comes to supporting your cover and also in keeping the liner from floating when the winter is your rainy season.
 Do this by using a shop vac. You have to use the discharge of the shop vac to blow water out of every line from the filter system. When the water is purged from every line, you must put a plug in the lines at the pool end., Be reminded that the type of cover to use will depend on several factors., The filter must have a plug at the bottom that allows it to drain. Always be sure to open the air relief valve on top in case you have one. Put the valve in the closed position and remove the pressure gauge.

 You have a much better chance of scoring your headshot if you can move your crosshair onto your target faster.

Fire in bursts of 2 or 3 with an AK, and bursts of 3 or 4 with the M4.

Put recoil to good use. At extremely long distances, it is best to aim for the upper chest. Not only will your target suffer the damage from a bullet to the chest, the recoil of the second or third shot will usually take his head off.

Use the strafing method. The strafing method is where you fire 2-3 shots with your rifle, then strafe either left or right a short distance and then fire again. Making sure you maintain your aim, rinse and repeat. Try not to be too predictable, strafing left and right alternatively will make you an easy target. Try strafing in sporadic, unpredictable patterns.

Do not crouch and stay still. Despite your aim being steadied when you are crouched, you are made an easy target. If you want to crouch, try using the popping method - strafing normally until you are about to fire, and quickly tapping the control key. While you are descending into a crouch, fire a bullet or two off. This is a fast, accurate and effective way of killing long range.;
, With the AK and using the popping method, you can afford to shoot 4-5 bullets.
 The M4 is certainly better suited for spraying than the AK because of recoil pattern differences.

Do not 'spray 'n' pray'. When you are spraying, do not panic, and keep your aim controlled. Depending on how close your enemy is from you, you may want to aim slightly lower than the head or body to compensate for recoil.
The AK47 Spray pattern jumps upwards quickly in a backwards "7" shape after the second uncontrolled shot making it a good weapon to spray at the knees or feet close range to pick up a headshot.

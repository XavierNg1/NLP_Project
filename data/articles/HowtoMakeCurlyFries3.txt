 Toss the fries in a generous amount of olive oil. Keep tossing until all fries have an even coating of oil.If youâ€™d like to spice your fries, now is an ideal time. Try using salt, pepper, garlic salt and chili powder. Arrange the fries in a single layer on a cookie sheet.


Use more baking sheets and less fries per sheet. Keep the fries from touching one another to help them become crispy and cook evenly., Wait for your oven to preheat. It may be tempting to put the fries in and be done with it, but wait. Allowing the oven to complete preheat means your fries will cook evenly and prevents them from getting soggy., After the fries bake for 15 minutes, give them a good flip. Either toss them in the pan or use a flipper to move them around. The flip will keep both sides of the fries browning and even crispiness., Generally, after flipping initially, your fries will need another 10-15 minutes baking time. When your fries are the desired golden brown, you know they are finished. Remove your fries from the oven and allow them to cool slightly before serving.


Turn the oven to broil for the last few minutes if you desire extra crispiness. This will quickly give the fries a very deep brown color.

 Before you work on the stove, make sure that it's off and not hot. If you are removing rust from the cast iron, make sure that you wear gloves and a facemask. Also, make sure the stove is in a well-ventilated area and open up all the windows if you are cleaning it indoors., Go back and forth over rusted areas on the stove with a #00 or #000 steel wool or a wire brush until the rust starts to come loose. Continue to do this over all the rusted areas of the cast iron until you've removed all the rust you can.You can also use a 150 to 400 grit sandpaper instead of steel wool.
 Use a vacuum attachment or a shop vac to remove all the dust particles and debris that you were able to sand off the cast iron. Continue to go over the entirety of your oven until all the dust has been removed., Put some cast iron polish into a rag or cloth and rub it onto the surface of your oven. Apply a thin coat of cast iron polish over the entirety of the oven. This should change the hue of the oven and make it appear shinier. Once you've applied the polish, let it dry for a 24 hour period.You can purchase cast iron polish at fireplace stores or online.
 Make sure that the polish has dried completely before washing off your oven. Use a dry cloth and dab the surface of the oven to test that it has fully dried. If it is dry, scrub the cast iron with a damp cloth. If there is still rust or dirt remaining, you may have to repeat the process of scraping and polishing the oven to get it completely clean., Use a dry terry cloth or cotton rag to completely dry off the oven. Once it's dry, put some dry kindling in the oven and bring it outside. Light a fire and bring the oven to 300°F (148.88°C). Continue to heat it until the oven no longer smokes. Once it stops smoking, your oven is safe to use again.If you are heating the oven indoors, make sure you have plenty of ventilation because the polish smoke is hazardous to your health.

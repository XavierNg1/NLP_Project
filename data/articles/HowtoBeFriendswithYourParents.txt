Treat your parents the way you want them to treat you. If you want them to listen to you, then listen to what they have to say. Giving respect gains respect.;
, Just as you might try a sport with a new friend, why not join your parents in their hobbies and let them take part in yours?

, Children (and sometimes adults) often see parents as a bank clerks, chefs, or house keepers. Instead of letting your parents do everything for you, share in tasks and be responsible for your actions.
 Doing things together makes relationships stronger.
 It's a good way to break down old habits and styles of interaction; plus, it's more intimate. You may find that a parent opens up to you more, or opens up in different ways, when the other parent isn't present.
 Inform them "politely and diplomatically" the issues which you are not comfortable talking/sharing with them.
 Sometimes, showing mutual appreciation is the best way to build and maintain relationships.


Never forget their birthdays. It is symbolizes affection. It's a good feeling to know that you are in other people's thoughts.
 If you act ashamed of them when your friends are around, how do you think they feel? If you chew their face off because they call you to see if you'd like something, how you're doing, or what you'd like for dinner, do you think they'll be friendly for long?

, Telling the truth goes a long way in gaining your parents trust. You may be tempted to lie about a mistake you made, in order to avoid getting in trouble, but it will only make matters worse if they DO find out what you did. And parents pretty much ALWAYS find out about this stuff. If you confess your mistake and apologize in a mature way, they may still be angry, but they will be proud of you for dealing with things responsibly. Being mature doesn't mean not making mistakes. It means handling your mistakes responsibly.
 This applies if you live far from them. You can even pay them a visit as a surprise. They will love it.

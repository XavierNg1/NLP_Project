 Towel dry your hair just a little, but it still needs to be wet! Do this at night.;
, Use a wide-toothed comb to get out all of the tangles. Do not use a brush, as it damages wet hair.
 Take a small section from either side of your head, and clip the rest back with a large clip. If it is easier for you, use a rat tail comb to section your hair.
 Braid your hair into small, normal braids, starting from as high on the roots as you can get. Once you have finished the braid, tie it off with a small elastic.
 Once you have finished a section, unclip hair and section again. Continue braiding your hair until you have made all of your braids.
 In the morning, take out all of the braids and gently run your fingers through your hair to flatten it a little. Use a light to medium hold hairspray if desired. Do not brush your hair.

 If you have planned your restaurant outing in advance, monitor your blood glucose levels carefully throughout the day and eat wisely and within general diabetic dietary restrictions.
 Check your glucose levels in the restroom or outside the restaurant if you prefer, but be sure to keep track of your blood sugar levels before and after the main meal.


If you plan to have dessert, it may be wise to do a quick sugar check before ordering any cheesecake or chocolate mousse.

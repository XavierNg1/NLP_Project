 For the fudge, you’ll need a 9-inch by 9-inch (23-cm by 23-cm) baking dish. Use a piece of wax paper to line the pan so the fudge won’t stick.You can substitute parchment paper for the wax paper if you prefer.
 Add ½ cup (113 g) of butter to a saucepan. Heat the butter over medium heat until it melts completely, which should take 3 to 5 minutes., When the butter is melted, add ½ cup (118 ml) of milk and 2 small (3.4 ounce/96 g) packages of lemon cook-and-serve pudding to the pan. Stir the mixture together until it’s completely blended.For the creamiest fudge, use whole milk.
 When the mixture is blended, raise the heat to medium-high. Allow the mixture to come to a boil, and then cook it for an additional minute to thicken it.Stir the mixture constantly as you bring it a boil.
 After you’ve cooked the fudge mixture for a minute, remove it from the heat. Add 3 ¾ cups (469 g) of powdered sugar to the pan, and mix it until it is fully incorporated., When the fudge mixture is completely blended, pour it into the prepared pan. Use a rubber spatula to press and smooth the mixture in place. Lightly dust the top with powdered sugar if desired.Make sure to spread the fudge mixture in as even a layer as possible in the pan.
 Once the fudge is in the pan, place it in the refrigerator. Let it chill for 3 to 4 hours, or until the fudge is completely set., When the fudge is fully set, remove it from the refrigerator. Use a sharp knife to cut it into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces and serve.Keep any leftover fudge in an airtight container. It should keep for 1 to 2 weeks.

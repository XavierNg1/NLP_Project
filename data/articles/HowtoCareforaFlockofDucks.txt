, Keep them in their shelter with a bit of outdoor running for the first few days. If you leave them out at night when they first come to their new home, they may fly away, so lock them in their shelter at night for the first few days.
 Ducks always need fresh water. They also need grass, grain and grit to feed on. Grit is needed for digestion, so put it in a flower pot or box for them to eat. Ducks will usually also forage for slugs, snails, and worms as a snack. All you need to supplement the bug diet is basic grain ration. If you want to fatten up your ducks to butcher, feed them corn and mixed protein foods.
 Healthy ducks will produce for up to three years. The dark part of your duck shelter should have separate sections for comfortable egg-laying. If your ducks won't lay eggs, put china eggs in the nest to encourage them to lay eggs. Take the eggs out daily, since foxes are attracted to them and to avoid brooding and damaged eggs. Before cooking, wipe the shells since they are more porous then that of the hen.

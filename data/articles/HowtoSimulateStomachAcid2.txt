 For this type of experiment, you can simulate a stomach with a strong zip-top plastic bags. Freezer bags are usually stronger than regular bags. You'll also need water (or one of the liquids from the first section) and food (bread works well).While using water doesn't simulate stomach acid, most foods will break up in water eventually, especially bread or crackers.
You also may want to wear latex gloves for this experiment, as well as put down newspaper or paper towels.
 Tear the food into larger pieces to simulate the teeth breaking it apart. Add the food to the bag. Pour in enough liquid to cover the bag. Squeeze out the extra air, and zip up the bag., Gently squeeze the bag back and forth. This motion simulates how the stomach works. Keep working at it until the food is mostly broken apart., At this point, you can end the experiment, as you've simulated the stomach. However, you can also simulate the small intestine. For this part of the experiment, you'll need a single stocking, with the foot cut out. Scoop the food in one end. Squeeze the food down the stocking, noticing how liquid comes out through the stocking as you go. When you've reached the other end, squeeze the food out onto a plate, simulating how food is turned into feces and squeezed out of the anus.

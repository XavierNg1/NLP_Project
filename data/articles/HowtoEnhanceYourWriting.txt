, A great way to practice this is to pick a random topic and write about that for 5-10 minutes, and never stop writing! Even if your words run dry, keep it flowing! It doesn't matter what you write; just write something!

, Read whatever you enjoy reading and figure out what you like about that author's writing and try to write like that. Also you will learn all sorts of new words.
 Anywhere. Try on your arm or sticking bits of paper in your pockets.
 If you hate writing about owls, don't write about owls. Eventually, you'll become comfortable writing about anything, but even then you'll always have favorites.
 If you are in a forest, pretend like you're a character and imagine what you'd write if you were describing this place and what kind of mood you would set and what kind of action would take place.
 Occasionally, to challenge yourself, write about something you aren't fond of. Eventually you may even like writing about owls.

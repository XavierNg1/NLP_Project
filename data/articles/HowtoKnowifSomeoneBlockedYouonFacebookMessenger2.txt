 You can use any web browser to access Facebook Messenger on your computer.


Blocking your messages is not the same as blocking you on Facebook. When a person blocks your messages, you’ll remain friends with them on Facebook and will be able to interact on one another’s timelines. They can also unblock you at any time.
 If you’re already signed in, you’ll see a list of recent conversations. If not, click Continue as (your name) or type your login information as prompted.
 It’s at the top-left corner of the screen. As you type, a list of contacts will appear.
 This opens a chat with that person.
 It’s at the bottom of the screen.
 If you are blocked, you’ll see a message in the chat box (where you just typed) that says “This person isn’t available right now,” they have either blocked your messages, deactivated their Facebook account, or completely blocked you on Facebook.


If the message goes through without error, your messages are arriving to their destination. It’s possible that the person just hasn’t logged into to read them.
 If you received the error message, your final step is to figure out if their profile looks any different on Facebook.


Sign in to https://www.facebook.com, then search for the person’s profile. If you can’t find their profile, they’ve either deactivated their account or blocked you completely. If their profile appears normal, they’ve only blocked your messages.
If you can’t find the profile at all, there’s only one way to find out if you’ve been completely blocked—ask a mutual friend to view their profile. If the mutual friend can see the profile but you can’t, your entire Facebook account has been blocked by the user.

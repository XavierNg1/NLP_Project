 Official Louis Vuitton purses do not have the tag attached. The tag is separate, often slid into a pocket of the purse. Be especially wary of tags that look cheap and are attached with little more than string.
 Knock-offs use cheap plastic or suede to line their bags. Depending on specific design, a real bag is lined with a variety of textiles, such as canvas, fine micro monogram textile, cross-grain leather, polyester, or microfiber suede.
 The oxidizing natural cowhide leather does not need protective plastic, and bags that come with that plastic are fakes.
 Legitimate bags use brass or gold metal, but fakes use plastic with a layer of gold paint.
, Originally, authentic Louis Vuitton bags were only made in France. However, for the past several decades the company has also manufactured bags in the United States, Spain, Germany, and Italy.
 The majority of bags made after the early 1980s have a production code stamped on the bag. Since the 1990s, the code includes two letters followed by four numbers. Before the 1990s, the code was a one or two letter code followed by three or four numbers. Some were also simple three number codes.


Look in the right place. The date code is located beneath the D-ring.
 Although Louis Vuitton bags are similar, no two designs are exactly alike. Research what kind of lining, feet, and base, as well as other details, a particular style of bag should have. Check the company's website or ask your nearest boutique.

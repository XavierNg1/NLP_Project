 You can deactivate your Facebook account temporarily. None of your information will be deleted, and you can reactivate it at any time. While this doesn't keep you from accessing it, subconsciously knowing that it's deactivated could help keep you from visiting it.


When you deactivate your account, your profile will be hidden from the rest of Facebook, which will help keep you from getting distracted by notifications and messages.
 You can easily reactivate your Facebook account at the end of the day by logging back in with your email address and password. Your account will be restored and your information will be saved.

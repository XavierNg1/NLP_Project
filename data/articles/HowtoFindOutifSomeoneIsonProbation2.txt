 You can call a probation office and ask if a person is on probation under their supervision. You will most likely want to telephone the office in the county where the person lives. Also, since some probationers (people on probation) are allowed to check in with their probation office remotely by phone or mail, they may no longer live in the same county where their probation office is located. Locate the probation office in any county where the person used to live, if you have that information.
 You should be able to find an official website of a county's probation office, which will contain contact information. You can also search the database of probation offices at https://www.appa-net.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Webcode=VB_Directory.
 When you call, ask if the office can verify whether a person is on parole under their supervision. Be prepared to give the person's name and any other identifying information you can provide. If you have further questions, ask to speak to the person's parole officer.

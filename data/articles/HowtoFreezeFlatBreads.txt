, If desired, place a sheet of wax paper between each flat bread stacked on top of another. This will make them easier to pull apart for thawing.
 The main thing is to ensure that the flat bread has enough space to be stored without getting broken. It can stand upright or sit flat, depending on the space available.


Avoid placing anything heavy on the flat bread or it may break while frozen.







Heat in a hot oven for 10 minutes.






Remove and open the foil carefully to allow the steam to escape. Wear oven mitts to avoid a burn.






Serve.

 You are not the cause. They may not love each other anymore, but they love you, and that's why they are in this custody battle. Your friends could provide you a little moral support and that could be helpful.;
, Allow them to deal with their own emotions without getting involved.
 Answer the judge honestly; no one is going to be angry or upset with you. The judge simply wants to make sure you are going somewhere you'll feel safe and comfortable.
 Know that they love you very much, and love them back.
 For example, if you wanted to stay with your mom, but you really need to stay with your dad, try not to be sad. He is your daddy and he loves you. There will still be time for you to visit your mom.
 Tell your parents that you want to stay, for example, with your dad. Tell them that you are facing major changes in your life because of their decision and that you'd appreciate having your opinions considered as they try to work out where and with whom you'll live.
 If you're supposed to go to your dad, but you'd rather be with your mom, tell your dad yourself, instead of making your mom tell him. Also, if you don't want to do something your parent has planned, be honest about it and say what you'd rather do. That parent would like to know what would make you happy.
 Go to your best friend, a teacher you can trust, or your church pastor, and tell them what is on your mind. It will help you greatly to get some of your own thoughts and anxieties off of your chest!

, Just remember, they are having a difficult time just like you. When you need to talk to them, speak up, help them keep you a top priority.

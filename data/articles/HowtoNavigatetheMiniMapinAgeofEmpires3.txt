 Pressing the arrow keys accordingly (i.e., left key to move left, up key to move up, and so on) will allow you to scroll the focus to the area of the minimap you want to go to.
 If you need to move to a different location on the game world, just press the arrow keys.
 If you want to adjust how quickly the minimap scrolls when using the arrow keys, click the Menu button on the top right corner of the screen and then click “Options.” On the left-hand pane of the Options screen, click “Game Options.”


On the Game Options screen, you will see sliders for Scroll Speed and Camera Acceleration Time. Adjust the Scroll Speed slider to control how quickly the minimap scrolls when you press the arrow keys and the Camera Acceleration Time slider to set how quickly the camera accelerates to full speed when using the Arrow Keys to navigate.

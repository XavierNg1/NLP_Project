 This will be the color of the the body and head.;
,, Try not to make the crayfish any longer than it is.
 Start to mold the head in a bit of a cone, but try to flatten the tip of the head a bit.
 Cut the piece in half.
,, You will need 2 pairs of 3 legs, 3 on each side of the lobster cousin. Make the small snake just a little smaller or bigger than your middle finger. Then about a quarter down the leg, bend it so it looks like the crayfish is actually walking on something. Once you've done this, repeat this step 5 more times.
 If you aren't sure what the tail looks like, look up lobster or crayfish on Google images to get a good idea to make your model more realistic.
 Thin out the bottom for the start of the claws. Take out a piece from the clay claw so that one side of the claw is smaller than the other side.

 Generally speaking, you can use coconut oil in place of other oils (vegetable, canola, etc.) for baking and cooking.


Use equivalent portions of melted coconut oil for most oils. For example, if a recipe calls for ½ cup of vegetable oil, use ½ cup of melted coconut oil.
To replace shortening with coconut oil, mix coconut oil and butter in equal proportions. Use ¾ the amount called for by a recipe.For example, if a recipe asks you to use 2 cups of shortening, use ¾ coconut oil and ¾ cup butter to make a mixture totaling 1 ½ cups.
 Allow the coconut oil to come to room temperature, or melt it, or blend it to a paste-like consistency, then use as you would butter.You can also substitute coconut oil for butter when making a butter-based frosting for baked goods., Eggs are often used as a binding agent, but coconut oil can work just as well. This can help if you are trying to cook vegan, and is another way to incorporate coconut oil into your diet. Simply use 1 tablespoon of coconut oil in place of one egg, adjusting as necessary if you are seeking a particular consistency.

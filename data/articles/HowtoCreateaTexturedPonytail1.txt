 If you already have curly or wavy hair, you can skip this step and move onto the next. If you have straight hair, prep it by adding loose curls to it with a flat iron. You can do this by wrapping strands of hair around a flat iron, then closing the flat iron on it for a few seconds. Finish off with a texturizing hairspray or mousse.;
, You will eventually be pulling this hair back towards the ponytail. The ponytail can be as high or as low as you want, but something on level with your ears would work the best with this style. Also, don't worry if your ponytail isn't perfectly neat or smooth; this is part of the look!

, Tilt your head forward and flip the ponytail over the top of you head. Clip it in place if needed. Next, spray the hair at the back of your head/nap with hairspray and comb it upwards towards your ponytail., Insert the bobby pins upwards into the base of your ponytail. This will also help give your ponytail some lift and volume., Pinch some of the hair at the top of your head between your fingers, and gently tug it to loosen it. Don't pull the hair completely out of the ponytail. Do this a few more times at various spots around the ponytail to get that textured, messy look., You can use a boar bristle brush or a teasing brush for this. Start close to the base of your ponytail, and brush it upwards using short strokes. Work your way down to the base of your ponytail.
 If they are very long, secure them to the base of your ponytail with more bobby pins. Again, don't worry about being too neat here., Use a lightweight, volumizing hairspray. Once you are done, you are ready to rock your new style.

 This means you shouldn’t be seeing the apple logo on the screen, rather it should just be black. If you must, wait until the screen turns off.


If your device won’t turn off, let the battery run dead.This may take a few hours, but if your phone is no longer responding to button use and won’t turn off, it is the best option. If you choose to let it die, make sure to plug it in when you are ready to force reboot.;
, The home button is located on the front of the screen and is circular. The sleep/wake button is usually located on the right hand side of the phone, but is sometimes located on the top of the phone in older models.The sleep/wake button is the button you usually press to either put your phone to sleep, or turn the screen back on., You may need to hold them together for up to ten seconds. Once you see the apple logo appear on the screen, you can release the buttons.This is a force reboot or a hard reset, and your apple product may be repaired afterwards.


A white screen of death may seem overwhelming but if it can be repaired, your data will more often than not be restorable.

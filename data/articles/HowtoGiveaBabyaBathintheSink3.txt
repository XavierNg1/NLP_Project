 It used to be quite common for people to bathe their babies directly in a sink. Baths designed especially for babies, however, increase your babyâ€™s safety, and many fit right into your sink. Choose a flexible rubber mold that will fit the sink in which you plan to bath your baby.When bathing a baby in a sink, make sure you can sit or stand comfortably at a height that allows you to hold the baby securely and be careful that the faucet is not in the way or could injure the baby.
 You may want to consider getting a standalone bathtubs designed for bathing babies. These can placed within a bathtub, on the ground, or on a counter or table. The benefit of these tubs is that they are larger, and your baby will not outgrow it as quickly as they will outgrow a sink insert.Baby basins are a great option, as they allow you to bathe your baby where you feel most comfortable. These tubs cost between $20 and $70 and are available online or from stores such as Babies'R'Us.
 The most important criteria in choosing where to bathe your baby is safety. To improve the safety of a sink, clean it thoroughly with soap and water and then rinse the sink completely. Further, line the sink with rubber, or even a thick towel. This will provide cushion and provide a less slippery surface.

 If you're unsure, pick one of your favorite letters. For example, you may want a character with the letters L and S in their name, because you like how those letters sound or feel they would fit the character’s personality.
 Common name endings for girls are: a, bell, na, ly, ie, y, line, etc. Common name endings for boys: ob, ab, an, ly, etc. Pick one you like, or make one up!

, If the thing you pick/see isn't a good jumping off point for a name, think of synonyms for the thing.


For example, if you are staring at the moon, think of a synonym, such as “celestial body”, which could become the name “Celeste”.
 You may like the letters “o” and “a”, and could add a “n” and “h” to make “Noah”.


If the name you come up with sounds clunky, add more letters, but don't overdo it.

 Do not slouch your shoulders forward or hunch them up by your ears. Your posture should be relaxed and confident. Use your shoulders to slightly lift your chest up, making room for your lungs to take in more air. Think of Superman posing triumphantly.


Don’t force this posture unnaturally. Simply focus on keeping your shoulders as far back as possible while still feeling comfortable.;
, Your chin should be parallel to the floor. This is essential for keeping the airway in your throat open – looking up or down will constrict your vocal chords and limit your singing ability., Do not bend forwards or backwards from the waist. Instead, stand up straight so that your shoulders are above your ankles and your back is relaxed.
 Your feet should be 6–7 inches (15.2–17.8 cm) apart, with one foot slightly in front of the other. This will keep you weight slightly forward as you sing., Keep your knees and elbows loose and slightly bent so that you are not standing rigidly in place. This helps more than just your posture – a relaxed, loose body helps you generate air and control your voice while you sing., The best way to see your mistakes is in the mirror. Watch yourself from the side and from the front, fixing any mistakes as you see them. You can also practice against a wall—simply stand against it in bare feet, focusing on making your head, shoulders, butt, and heel touch the wall.Remember:


Shoulders back.
Chin level with the floor.
Chest out.
Stomach flat.
Joints relaxed.

 Challenges are exactly what they sound like - they're fan-made creations that are designed to make your gameplay much more interesting and challenging. A challenge doesn't normally require anything special to do - just your imagination.
 Create a Sim and start them out without a home and one thing that must remain on the lot for the entire challenge (think of it as the 'legacy' part - passing on the family heirloom and returning honor). It is up to that Sim to build a house, make a life and have children with their partner. You must play for ten generations of Sims - how long can you go on for?

, Create a teen, but don't make them look fabulous - they should have less-than-average clothes with messy hair. Put them on an empty lot and try to make money and survive the old fashioned way - fishing, gardening, finding artifacts.. anything goes when you're trying to survive. You can find the full rules simply by searching the Teen Runaway Challenge for Sims 4.
 Think of what you have available to you with CC and your current game - what wacky things can you attempt to do?

 If you want to give up “cheat days” completely, this also means sticking to a regular fitness routine. Studies show that working out at the same time each day can reinforce the habit, and lead to greater fitness gains.For most people, this means working out first thing in the morning, or first thing right after work.
No matter what time of day you choose, selecting a time and sticking to it will help you to commit to daily workouts.
 Just like with food, knowing what workout you’re going to do before you do it eases stress and helps you to make healthy choices. Prioritize this time for yourself and stick to it.It is important to work different parts of the body on different days, as well as to get a mix of cardio, strength training, and stretching.
Create a workout schedule for yourself that lasts for at least one month.
 It may come as no surprise that one of the very best ways to stick to your fitness routine is to do it with someone else. Find a fitness buddy who enjoys the same types of activities you do. Have fun, stay accountable, and get your exercise every day.Make sure it is someone who has a compatible schedule.
Plan your workout calendar together.
 Even if your plan is to exercise every day of the week, it is still important to rest, otherwise you run the risk of injuring yourself. Plan some active rest days! Maybe you hit the gym six days a week, and on that seventh day you go for a hike, or a leisurely jog at the beach. Find a way to have fun and be active while letting your body recuperate.

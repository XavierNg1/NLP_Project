 Look into the various concepts of math and science (almost always physics-based concepts along with (especially in the case of Animal Kingdom park) Biology and Evolution) along with other educational values in various areas of the parks.;
, Almost most rides actually have some educational value, there are some that don't seem like it. And to avoid the disappointment of showing one that doesn't, research what values it tries to teach yourself.


Preview the newest copies of the rides you'll be wanting to teach, from YouTube.
Research on the Internet places where educational values can and will be taught.
Call the Disney Parks on a phone. Ask them what values the specific ride will teach this kids. Be willing to provide the age groupings of each of the kids if they vary in ages, and make it sound like you are planning an educational trip for a class of "x (age)"-year old kids for an "anonymous" group of kids.
, Try to see the ride from the viewpoint of the kid. Although almost all rides in Epcot's future world are devoted to educational concepts, there are some who can turn wild and be at disappointment for some. Realize you may have to tone the ride down to suit the age group.
 Point out each issue you'd like to mention, as you ride, unless the ride is so loud and fast you can't even feel your brain thinking. If the latter is apparent, point these points out after riding and note the exact points using "landmark" areas of information.

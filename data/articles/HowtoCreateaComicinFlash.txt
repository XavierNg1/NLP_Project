,, Make a symbol over the comic strip that is only a black square with no filling over the squares on the image. Drawn inside the square(s).
 Find a font to convey what they are saying. If it's in black and white, draw a line to it, if its in color, draw a talking, thinking or 'BAM!' bubble so the color won't interfere. Color it white in on the inside.
 Once on that, go to layout and click on Storyboard-Boxes.

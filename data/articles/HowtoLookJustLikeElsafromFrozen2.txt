 It fits more "Elsa" as she is not very open about herself, plus she doesn't expose much skin. Places to get good long sleeves are:


Aeropostale
Macy's
Hollister
H&M

, If you like short sleeves more than long sleeves, you can also go to the Disney Store to buy "Let it go" graphic tees or one with Elsa on it.
 The rhinestones will look like snowflakes. You can even get a kimono with a big snowflake on the back with little snowflakes around it, or even make your own snowflakes out of rhinestones.
 However, if you don't wear "crazy" colors, that's totally fine! You can wear natural makeup if you like, as it is all about being confident in yourself. You can also wear lots of mascara, but not so much that your lashes become stiff and caked.
 This braid starts at the middle of her head, so keep that in mind. Here is what you do to make it:


Pull out your bangs.
Grab a section and divide it in two.
From the right side, take a chunk and cross it over the left.
Now from the left side, take a chunk and cross it over to the right.
Repeat until the remaining hair is about the size of your other pieces.
Take the remaining hair and cross it over whatever side you are on.
Now you have 3 strands.
Braid until you reach the ends.

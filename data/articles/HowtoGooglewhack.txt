You can only use two words.
No proper nouns.
They have to be real words.
Proper spellings only (you might want to check your phrase on Word or something before whacking)
The words must appear in Google's dictionary (if they do, then they'll be underlined in blue at the top of the page after you search)
No putting quotes around the words.
Google gives you a little blurb of the page that the words came up on. If it's just a list of words that the two happen to appear in, then that page doesn't count.;

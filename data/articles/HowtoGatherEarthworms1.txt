 You will need: a shovel or spade and a container filled with moist soil and leaves.


An ideal time to look for earthworms is when you are already digging up soil, such as during gardening, fence building, or digging a foundation. If you go deeper than just the surface, you will find different types of earthworms, including nightcrawlers.
Dress for gardening. You’ll be digging through soil for worms, so you’re likely going to get dirty. You may want to wear old clothes, knee pads, gardening gloves, gardening boots or shoes.;
, Select a patch of ground in your backyard, garden, or forest and begin digging a small hole. As you lift the soil out, sift through it for worms and collect any that you find. An excellent place to dig for worms is near a stream or water source.


You can also try digging in a community garden or forest floor, but you should avoid digging up earth in privately owned golf courses, fields, and public parks.
Be as quiet as possible so your vibrations don’t spook the worms.
Be sure to look under rocks, logs, and other items lying on the ground.
 Worms are equipped with setae, which are bristles that help them move through the earth. This may make it difficult to pull worms directly out of the ground. Dig around a worm that is trying to burrow back into the ground, being careful not to cut the worm. Once you’ve loosened the soil, it will be easy to pluck the worm out and put it in your storage container.
 When you’ve exhausted a patch of ground, replace the soil and begin digging a new hole a couple feet away. Repeat the digging and searching process, and replace the soil when you are finished.

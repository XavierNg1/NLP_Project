 Oily skin is caused by excess skin oil (or sebum), which begins to occur for both males and females during puberty. The amount of oil produced varies from person to person, but for some people there will be an excess of oil, giving the skin a shiny and oily look.


After puberty the oil production generally subsides, but problems with oily skin can continue into adulthood.
Oily skin is often exacerbated by hot and humid weather conditions.
Oily skin can be uncomfortable and upsetting, and those with oily skin tend to suffer more from acne., If you have oily skin and acne, heightened stress levels may exacerbate the problem.Adopt a healthy lifestyle and try to find ways to relax. To calm down at a particular moment try doing some deep breathing, or even some gentle yoga or meditation.


Going out for a walk can help you to clear your head while getting some exercise.
Make exercise a regular part of your daily routine to help you blow off some steam.
 It is a myth that greasy foods lead directly to greasy skin and acne, but it’s important to have a healthy diet to promote good overall health and well-being. Some foods, including those rich in carbohydrates, such as bread, may trigger acne. The oiliness of your skin does not depend on what you eat, but if you work in a kitchen, oil can stick to your skin and block your pores., Thick sunscreens can be difficult for people with oily skin, as the heavy liquid will add new oiliness to your skin and block your pores. It is, however, absolutely vital to protect your skin from the sun. When you are buying sunscreen look for “oil-free” options, and products designed especially for those with oily skin.


Sunscreen gels are generally less likely to block your pores than lotions or creams.
Choose a sunscreen that has broad spectrum coverage with an SPF of at least 30. Make sure that the sunscreen is water-resistant. Apply at least 15 minutes before you go in the sun and wear it daily.

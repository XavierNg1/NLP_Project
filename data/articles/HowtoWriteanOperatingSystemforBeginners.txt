 You will need Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express Edition and the Cosmos User Kit. Get Visual C# at http://www.microsoft.com/express and get the Cosmos User Kit at http://www.codeplex.com/Cosmos/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx.;
, If you took the entire Visual Studio, it will take a long time to install, however VCS itself will not take that long. Install VCS first, then install the Cosmos User Kit.
 Before you start programming, you will obviously need to start learning C#. If you already know, then skip to the next step.
 Create a new project in VCS by clicking File, New Project and selecting CosmosBoot, or the like. Then you can start coding. Enter your code on the line after 'Cosmos.Kernel.Boot.Default;'. You can add 'Console.WriteLine("Cosmos booted.");' to test it out.
 Leave everything at it's default, unless you want to burn it to a CD and select ISO Image. See further instructions on YouTube, just run a search for 'Cosmos C#' or something like that.

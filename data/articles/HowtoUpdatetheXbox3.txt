 Flash drives plug into USB ports, which are rectangular slots likely found on the side(s) of your computer's housing; a CD, on the other hand, goes in your computer's CD slot.

If you're using a CD, make sure it's a CD-RW ("read-write") rather than a CD-R ("read only").If a blank window for your flash drive or CD pops up, leave it alone--you'll need to use it in a minute.
 You can do so from the Xbox website:


USB - Go to the following link to start your download: http://www.xbox.com/system-update-usb


CD - Go to the following link to start your download: http://www.xbox.com/system-update-cd

You may first need to confirm the download or choose a save location before continuing.
 This will unzip it, allowing you to view its contents., To do so, select everything inside of the folder, then press Ctrl+C (PC) or ⌘ Command+C (Mac)., If your flash drive or CD didn't prompt a window to pop up, you can open the respective storage option either by opening My PC and double-clicking the flash drive or CD icon at the bottom of the window (PC) or by opening Finder and clicking the flash drive or CD name in the left-hand pane (Mac)., To do so, simply click the white space in the flash drive's or CD's window and press Ctrl+V (PC) or ⌘ Command+V (Mac).

Make sure you paste the contents in the main window of the flash drive or CD and not in a folder.
 You can do this by pressing the Power button on the Xbox 360 console, or you can press and hold the Guide button on a connected controller., The flash drive goes in one of the USB slots on the far-right side of the console's face, while the disk goes in the console's CD tray., Your update should be available in a pop-up window as soon as the console loads the Home screen.

If you use the console's Power button to do this, be sure to turn on a controller as well.
 This will prompt the update to begin.

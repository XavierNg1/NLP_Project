 The business owner serves as a conduit of revenue between the consumer and the governmental entity. You will need to keep records on how much tax you have collected and make sales tax liability accounts for each client, such as Sales Tax Payable.When the sales tax payment is made, the liability is satisfied.


If you are a contractor, you would record your sales tax as an operational expense.
 Once you have completed the forms using the data from the spreadsheet, mail them to the governmental entity with the sales tax payment. Or the client may wish to receive the forms and make the payment directly.
 All back-up documentation such as invoices and sales receipts need to be kept for seven years. This documentation will be required for sales tax audits.

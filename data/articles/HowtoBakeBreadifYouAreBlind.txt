 You will need roughly two or three cups of all-purpose or bread flour, one cup of lukewarm water, one package of dry active yeast, a pinch of salt, and two tablespoons of butter and sugar.;
, The measurements don't have to be precise, but close is always nice. Add the sugar and water together in a separate bowl, and pour the yeast in on top. stir gently and leave to activate for about five or ten minutes. When you return, pour the yeasty water into the flour.
 Dust your hands with more flour and begin to massage the flour and water. Gently scrape the still dry flour, salt and butter towards the mass of water, push, roll and massage. When the dough is smooth and silky to the touch, place it in a warm, lightly oiled bowl and cover it with a warm towel.
, When it's done, add more flour to your hands and work surface, remove the dough from the bowl and drop it onto the counter top. Knead it a few times until it feels right, about five minutes or so. Place it into the pan you will use.

You can roll the dough into a rectangle that might fit the pan, and roll it into a tube, placing it seam-side down in the pan with butter greasing it, or find your own way.
, Turn your oven on to 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 176 degrees Celsius and put the pan on the middle rack. Close the oven door and, after about twenty minutes or so, remove the pan from the oven. tap the top of the loaf, then the bottom.
 If the bread sounds hollow, it's done. Turn the bread onto a wire rack or cutting board and wait for it to cool before slicing it. Enjoy!

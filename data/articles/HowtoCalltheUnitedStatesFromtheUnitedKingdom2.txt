 Dial the UK’s international calling code into your phone, which is 00. This will signal that the phone number you are about to dial is out of the country.


If you’re calling from a mobile phone, you may need to press the “+” sign on the keypad before or instead of “00.”, After you dial 00, press 1 on your phone’s keypad. This is the country code for the United States that will signify that the phone number you are about to dial is a U.S. number.


If the phone number you wish to dial is listed online, in a directory, or spoken to you including the number 1 before the area code and next seven digits, you don’t need to dial the “1” more than once. For example, you would dial 00-1-(###)-###-####, not 00-1-1-(###)-###-####.
 After inputting the international calling code (00) and the country code (1), dial the area code of the region of the United States you are trying to reach.A U.S. area code is always a three-digit number, and is often listed in parentheses before the following seven digits of the phone number, like so: (###)-###-####.
A U.S. toll-free number replaces the area code with one of the following codes: 800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 844.However, toll-free numbers will not be free when calling from outside the U.S., and in fact may not work at all when dialed. Instead, call a company’s alternative, standard phone number.Note that a person’s area code may not be the same as their physical location in the United States if they’ve moved but kept the same phone number, or bought a phone in a different area than the one they live in.
 Follow the international calling code (00), the country code (1), and the three-digit area code with the remaining seven digits of the U.S. phone number. After all numbers are entered, press the call button to place the call.All U.S. phone numbers contain ten digits total, with three for the area code plus the remaining seven digits, like so: (###)-###-####.
Note that you should not include any special characters like “#,” “-,” “(,” or “)” even though they may appear in these examples or wherever the number you are trying to dial is listed.

 Whenever possible, opt for mushrooms sold out of loosely packed bins, as opposed to plastic-wrapped containers. This will allow you to select the cleanest and best-looking individual mushrooms.Look for the mushrooms with the thickest caps.
 Both the stem and the cap of the mushrooms you select should be firm and dry to the touch. Mushrooms with domed caps that curl under are especially fresh. Avoid shiitakes that appear shriveled, or feel soft or slimy to the touch.The gills on the underside of the mushroom’s cap should be dry and firm too.
Dark spots or a wet appearance indicate that a mushroom is past its prime. This evidence will first show itself on a mushroom’s gills.
 Refrigeration can help keep your mushrooms fresh. Keep them in an open plastic bag, as they need access to air. If you purchase them fresh, they will last for a few days.If you want to preserve shiitakes in the fridge for a bit longer, cut off their gills. This will keep the rest of the mushroom fresh for about a week.

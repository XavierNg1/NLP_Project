 You can't have a keyblade battle without keyblades of course so go find one at a toy store near you. Or you can make one. Design your own.;
, Mostly they will want to try too.
 So want to try as well. Make one strong and fierce with a good balance between your ground.
 Not your mom and dad of course. They wouldn't want you to do this anyway because this video could get you a small cut or bruise.
 No magic or specials will have to be done but physical or attack mode will be done. Play the game several times with your friend. Find cheats and walkthroughs and see if they help.
 I suggest a very grassy area near your house. Your house will give it more action feeling but I shall explain later.
 Make sure it supports YouTube or it won't work. Use incredible moves that seem impossible or dangerous like go on our porch and use once hand and jump over the fence and be ready to hit the other keyblade without any bruises{or not shown so practice} Hit and swing. Run toward each other and jump hitting each others' keyblade. Make some words into it or at least screaming and moaning. Then make when you hit them{try not to hurt them a lot} and they fall and moan as their keyblade disappear. Then comes back{do the editing later] Then make one of you the winner and try a Final Fantasy background when you win.
 Make keyblades disappear and appear, flashes, and a kingdom heart background music or Final Fantasy. Any could be good though One Winged Angel makes it intense to the viewers.
 Have fun and see how many comments you get and feedback.

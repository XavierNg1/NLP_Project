 Three standard styles exist:


The full-size open-weave rope hammock is the cheaper of the two types of full-size hammocks. It is recommended for people in warmer climates, as it provides better air circulation and is more durable in higher temperatures. As a cost-effective option, the rope hammock is probably the best bet.
The full-size fabric hammock is widely considered sturdier and more comfortable than the open-weave rope alternative. Fabric hammocks are almost always more expensive but generally last longer. Those willing to spend a little more for a higher-quality item should opt for the fabric hammock.
The hammock chair comes in both rope and fabric form. This option is ideal for those with limited space, and is much more viable as an indoor option for students or those living in bachelor apartments. It is the most affordable choice of the three, though it doesnâ€™t allow for the same freedom and flexibility as full-sized hammocks.
 Going in with a good idea of what you want will make your search for a hammock that much easier.

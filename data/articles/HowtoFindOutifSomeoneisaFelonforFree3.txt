 This site gathers sex offender information from states, territories, and tribes into one database. Simply enter a name to search.
 A search by name will determine if the individual in question has been an inmate of a federal prison at any time since 1982. You will know the person is a felon, though the site will not report the nature of the personâ€™s crime.
 The people on this list are not all felons, since some have not yet been captured and convicted. They are, however, blocked from entering or doing business in the United States because of suspected involvement in terrorism, drug trafficking, or providing weapons of mass destruction.

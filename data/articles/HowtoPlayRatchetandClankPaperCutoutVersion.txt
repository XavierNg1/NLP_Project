, Then let your friend draw his character.Your character can be from the many games(Ratchet, Captain Quark, the robots from Deadlocked, enemies, even Clank), from another game (Mario, Zelda, Pikachu, etc.), or create your own!Let your imagination go wild.If you draw Ratchet, you can draw him with armor or without armor and if you draw him with armor, you can copy armor from the game or create your own. If you draw Clank, you can draw him as normal Clank or giant Clank. Color your character in if you want.
 If you drew a character from a game, you can stick with the character's name or use another name.
 You can either draw it with your character or draw it separately and then attach it to your character. You can either draw a weapon from the many games(N60 Storm, Chopper, etc.) or create your own. However, only draw shooting weapons.Color in your weapon if you want.
, Would that rocky place outside with a few trees make a good battlefield? Or would you rather rumble inside your room? It's all up to you.
, When a player loses nanotech, shade in the nanotech units.
 Move around the battlefield and try to shoot your opponent. Aim for your opponent and say, "Shoot".If your opponent does not jump out of the way in one second or less, he takes damage and loses one nanotech unit. If you want the battlefield to be like Obani Draco, move your character on trees, walls, etc.
 Every time you win a round, you increase your nanotech units, get more weapons, etc. Only increase one thing per round victory. Keep track of round victories and stats on another sheet of paper.

 Put down the straight edge of a piece of paper onto your map between the two distances you want to measure. Make a tick mark on the paper’s edge to indicate your “point A” and one to indicate your “point B.”


Hold the piece of paper still and evenly against your two points in order to make the most accurate tick marks.
If you want to, you can use a ruler or tape measure straight on the map, and note down the measurement to the smallest fraction of a unit possible.
 Place a ruler or measuring tape up against your piece of paper with the two tick marks and note the distance from one to the other. Use this method when your distance is too large for the bar scale given on the map, or you want to find a precise measurement using numbers.


If measuring with centimeters, find the distance to the nearest millimeter. If using inches, find the distance to the nearest eighth of an inch.
Note the scale given at the bottom of the map. It should show a ratio and a bar scale given by both centimeters and inches, so you can choose which unit to measure by. If one equates to a whole number, like 1 centimeter = 1 mile, you might choose that unit for easiest measuring.
 Use the representative fraction, or ratio, of the map to find the ground distance based on your measurement on the map. Multiply your distance by the scale number.


For example, for a map with a scale of 1:10,000: If you measured 10 centimeters from your Point A to Point B tick marks, you would multiply 10 by 10,000 to get 100,000 centimeters, the true ground distance from Point A to Point B.You can then convert your number to a more relevant distance. 100,000 centimeters equals 1 kilometer, for example, which is about 0.62 miles.

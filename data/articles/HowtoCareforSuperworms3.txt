 You may want to allow some of your superworms to grow into beetles. The beetles can then breed, providing you with more superworms. If you have reptiles that feed on superworms, this can save you money. To start, separate larvae into chambers.Chambers should be tiny containers. Film canisters or vials work well.
Make sure to punch small holes in the lid of your containers for ventilation.
Use wheat bran or oatmeal as substrate. You should also add a small slice of carrot for moisture.
 The second life stage for superworms is the pupae stage. It takes about 10 days in a chamber for a superworm to pupate. In the pupae stage, superworms will curl up into a round ball. Once they reach this stage, remove them from the chambers. Put each pupae in an individual container, slightly larger than their original chambers, stocked with fruits, vegetables, and substrate., While you wait for the pupae to turn into beetles, make a breeder container. You will transfer beetles to this container so they can breed.Use any type of plastic container with smooth sides, such as a Rubbermaid container.
Add an inch of substrate such as wheat bran.
Place part of an egg crate in one corner. Beetles will gather here to breed.
Use a ventilated lid on the container.
 Check your pupae daily until you see beetles have emerged. Once your pupae has turned into a beetle, place it in the breeding chamber. Add each new beetle to the chamber. They will continue to breed until they die. You can remove superworms as you see them and feed them to your reptiles.

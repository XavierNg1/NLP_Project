 With a grocery buying business, this means determining which areas of town you will service, along with a list of grocery stores and supermarkets that you will use for filling customer orders. Identifying specific delivery days throughout the week as well as drafting guidelines for placing orders will help to set customer expectations and allow you to keep the business manageable.;
, Allow for expenses like wear and tear on your car, fuel costs and something for your time, as well as the actual cost of the groceries purchased. You may choose to charge a percentage of the total grocery bill or a flat rate per delivery, plus the cost of groceries. Whatever model is used, make sure it covers expenses and allows you to earn some profit from each completed order.
 Using free accounting software will work, as long as the software allows you to create customer accounts, prepare invoices and track income and expenses from your business venture.
 In many areas, even personal shoppers must obtain business licenses before offering their services in the area. Check with the local municipality to determine the cost of the license and where you can submit the required paperwork.
 Pass out fliers or business cards to neighbors, relatives and friends. Identify local publications and web sites that allow free advertising for this type of service. If possible, set up your own website and outline what you do, how orders are taken, a schedule of rates and prices for your services and the delivery schedules.
 Doing so will help to ensure repeat business and also prompt good word-of-mouth that allows you to increase your customer base over time. Always communicate with customers when an ordered item is not available and determine if a substitute is acceptable.

 Type in 'command' and the Command Prompt option should reveal itself.


This trick can be used on the more modern variations of Windows as well, such as Windows 8.1.
 Alternatively, if your desktop isn't working properly, you can just get to the Command Prompt via a restart. Access the Start Menu and manually restart your computer, or restart it using the physical power button. When the computer reboots, you'll have a chance to access the Command Prompt by pressing the F8 key.
 Pressing F8 opens a menu that gives you a list of ways you can boot your computer. Your mouse won't be available, so use the arrow keys to navigate the menu and the Enter key to make selections.

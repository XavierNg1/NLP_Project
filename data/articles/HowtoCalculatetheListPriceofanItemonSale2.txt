 In order to calculate the sale price of an item, you need to know what the original or list price is, and what the discount percent is.

For example, you might know that a sweater is $69 and on sale for 25% off.
 Remember that percents are hundredths, so to convert, either divide the percent by 100, or simply place a decimal after the number and move it two places to the left.For example, 25% expressed as a decimal is .25.
 This will give you the discount, in dollars, off the original price.

For example, 69×.25=17.25{\displaystyle 69\times .25=17.25}. So, $17.25 is the discount off the original price.
 This will give you the sale price.For example, 69−17.25=51.75{\displaystyle 69-17.25=51.75}. So, the sale price of a $69 sweater that is 25% off is $51.75.

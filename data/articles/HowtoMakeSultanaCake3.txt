 Prepare a loaf pan by either lining it with parchment (baking) paper or greasing with butter/margarine.
 Stir to combine well.
 Smooth out the top. Arrange the blanched almonds across the top of the loaf to form a topping. It can be random or added in a pattern, as preferred. Cover with foil.
 Bake for 1 1/2 hours.
 Let sit for 10 minutes in the pan, then allow to cool on a wire cooling rack.
 It can be buttered or eaten as it is.


Keep stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, in an airtight container.

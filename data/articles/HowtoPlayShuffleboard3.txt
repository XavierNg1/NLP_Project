 Deck shuffleboard has 2 oval scoring areas, each 6 feet (1.8 m) in length, spaced 30 feet (9 m) apart. There are lines in front of and behind each scoring area; the inside lines are called "Lady's lines" and the outside lines are called "Gentleman's lines.”, The disks are the same size as in outdoor shuffleboard and they are marked with two separate colors. The cues are similar to those in outdoor shuffleboard, although the shooting section, or "shoe," consists of a semicircle cut into a rectangular piece of wood.Players may play in teams of 2, with one player playing one end of the court and the other the other end.
 This is usually done with a coin toss, as in table shuffleboard., Keep going until all of the disks have been cast. Players stand behind the “gentleman's line” when shooting. During play, players can try to knock their opponent's disks out of the scoring area or off the court.Take any disks that fail to cross the Lady's line off the court.
 Tally up the points after all players have cast their disks. Disks score points according to where in the scoring area they land, as long as they are completely inside that scoring area.


The center of the scoring area consists of 9 squares labeled with the numbers 1 through 9, arranged in the format of a magic square; any line of 3 numbers adds to 15. The semicircle furthest from the players scores 10 points for any disk landing in it, while the semicircle nearest the players deducts 10 points for any disk landing in it.
 Whichever side reaches a score of either 50 or 100 first, wins.

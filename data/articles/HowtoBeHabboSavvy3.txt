 Not because they are nice, but because you are.
 Categorizing them would be best e.g. putting seats together on one side & plants together on another.
 Displaying items that are not for sale will only annoy your customers who will then annoy you with their questions and remarks.
 Having more of the same item in your inventory will make it easier for you to trade them without having to pick anything up.
 Anyone who is insistent that you pick your things up for no apparent reason is just spoiling for trouble. Ban him. He isn't worth your time or effort.
 Being cranky will turn away customers. Close your store once you find yourself tired, annoyed etc.

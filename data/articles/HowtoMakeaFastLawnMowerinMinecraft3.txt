 The more rookies you get, the faster the job will be. Only one is needed if you have a small lawn.
 Because rookies are very fond of dirt, tell them that you will give them a stack of dirt if they do the job well.


Kill them if they purposely made a big hole in your yard. Otherwise, give them the dirt and ask them politely to leave.

 Fill a small saucepot halfway with water and heat it on the stove over medium heat. Once the water begins to steam but before it begins to simmer or boil, pull it off the stove.


Do not allow the water to reach its boiling point, as it may end up heating the breast milk too quickly if it is this hot.
Always pull the pot of water off the stove before preparing to put the bottle or container of breast milk inside. Never directly heat the breast milk over the stove.



It is safe to allow the bottle to touch the bottom of the pot once you remove the pot from the stove, but if you are still apprehensive, simply hold the bottle in the water without letting it touch the bottom.
You can warm breast milk from a frozen or chilled state using this method. If you are warming breast milk from a chilled state, it should only take a few minutes. If warming it from a thawed state, it may take twice the time.
 Carefully swirl the bottle or container of milk to even out the temperature.


You could also stir the milk with a spoon or coffee stirrer to accomplish the same task.

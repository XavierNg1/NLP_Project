 Mix to combine thoroughly, then cover the pot.
 Bring to a boil over medium high heat, then reduce heat to med-low and simmer for 40-50 minutes, or until chicken is almost cooked.
 Set the sauce aside to be strained, reduced, and poured over the chicken later.
 In a large frying pan, heat the oil to medium high. Then, brown the chicken on all sides.
 Set the chicken pieces on a plate covered in paper towels.
 If youâ€™re in a more casual setting, you can just add the chicken back to the cooking pot after the sauce is ready.
 Remove the bay leaves, and the peppercorns if you find them too spicy.


If you want a smoother sauce, strain it with a strainer.
If desired, skim any excess fat from the top with a cold spoon or a fat separator.
 Remember to add the salt after you reduce the sauce, as it will get saltier from the soy sauce as it boils down.


If you prefer a thinner, less salty sauce, add a little water and reheat.
For a thicker sauce, heat the sauce on medium-high heat until it is reduced to your desired consistency.
Stir occasionally, making sure not to let the sauce burn on the bottom.
 Either pour over the chicken on your serving platter, or put the chicken back into the pot.
 Adobo is traditionally served over steamed rice. Pour a little extra sauce over the rice, if desired.

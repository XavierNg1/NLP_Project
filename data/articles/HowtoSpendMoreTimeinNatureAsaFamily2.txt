 If there are places to sit and relax, your family is more likely to spend their time outdoors. If you have a yard, put out chairs and places where people can sit and relax. Take advantage of any outdoor space that you have access to. If you have enough space, you can host outdoor parties in your front or backyard.Hanging hammocks will also encourage people to be outside.
 If your children aren't into nature, you can try to bring some technology to your backyard instead. Purchase a projector online and hang up a large white sheet in between two trees. Plug your projector into your laptop and play a DVD or streaming movie. This is a great way to get electronic-oriented children playing outdoors., If your family has a busy schedule, it may make it harder to go on all day outings in nature. If this is the case, make sure that you coordinate your schedule with your family members and figure out a time and date that is open for everyone. Even if you don't have a lot of time throughout the week, you can still allocate a couple of hours spending more time in nature as a family.

Instead of using the time to watch TV as a family, your family can have a conversation outside.
 Simple activities like reading, shopping, studying, or eating can all be moved to an outdoor setting. Move some of these things outdoors to set the tone for your family. If you insist on being outdoors more often for regular tasks, it will rub off on other people.

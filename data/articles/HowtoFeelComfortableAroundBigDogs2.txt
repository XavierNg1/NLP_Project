 Always let the dog approach you first. This will allow the dog time to adjust to having you in its space, and become more comfortable with you. If a dog is comfortable with you, you are more likely to be comfortable around the dog.If a dog is shy, but still approaches you, do not talk to the dog or make eye contact with it. Let your hand hang by your side so the dog can sniff it.
 Once the dog has approached and sniffed you, then it is ok for you to offer your hand for it to smell. When offering your hand, offer the back of your hand with your fingers closed, i.e., a relaxed fist position., When petting the dog, always pet the sides of the dog first. Try to avoid petting its head. A general rule of thumb is to start from the body and move towards the head.For example, begin by touching the dogâ€™s back. If the dog is comfortable with light touch, then begin to pet its back. If the dog becomes comfortable with you petting its back, then you can move toward the back of its head and ears.

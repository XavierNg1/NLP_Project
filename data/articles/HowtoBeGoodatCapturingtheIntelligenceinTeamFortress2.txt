 Only a few classes are ever good enough to actually get the enemy's intelligence out of their base. For example, a slow moving Heavy certainly would cause a ruckus, but probably couldn't even get out the flag room because of it's slowness. A fast moving Scout, on the other hand, is fragile, but can dodge enemy attacks.;
, Certain classes are perfectly built to help others. Go in small teams where each is given an achievable goal. Can your team deal with a base full of sentries? Are they mobile enough to get back to the base with the intelligence, or powerful enough to lock it down until a faster class arrives? Remember to communicate with your team as well. If you were killed by some camping spy/pyro etc. don't let your death be in vain. Warn your teammates so that they may avoid a similar fate!

, For example, if you are playing ctf_2fort, an engineer is likely to have set up a sentry near the spawn room, to kill enemy scouts. If possible, alert your teammates to the problem so they can at least delay your death until you can get around it.
 On ctf_2fort, the bridge across the middle has a roof. Scouts can double jump onto this roof and onto the other side, short-cutting across the entire lower section. Scouts can also double-jump across the court-yard if there is excellent defense near the lower entrance.
 If a pyro saw you, for example, you could turn around and gun him down while running down a long stairway. If a Heavy saw you, you could use your melee and run in circles around him to (mostly) avoid his minigun.
 Flag runners die from enemies behind them all the time.
 Wait a few seconds to let the enemy team be fooled into thinking there is nobody that got through their defense.
 In ctf_2fort, this is the courtyard. The closer you are to the enemy team's exit when you die, the easier it is to retrieve it on subsequent trips if it hasn't returned to its home.

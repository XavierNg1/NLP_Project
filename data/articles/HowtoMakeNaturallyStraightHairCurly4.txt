 There are many different types of curling irons available, and you want to choose one that will fit your hair and the style you want. If you want small, tight curls then choose a curling iron with a small barrel diameter. If you want beach style curls, get a bigger barrel. You can buy curling irons online or at beauty supply stores. , You want to do this before you curl your hair with a curling iron. Make sure you get every part of your hair including the nape of your neck and under the layers of your hair. Wait a second for the hair spray to dry before you start using the iron.
 Never go above 400 degree Fahrenheit. If your hair is fragile it's probably best to stick around 200 degrees but if it's thicker and coarser you could try 300 degrees too. , Don't make the sections too large or too small - depending on the amount of hair you have you'll probably want more or less sections. Just make sure it's manageable. Start at the top of your head and work your way down - this will make it a lot easier.
 Start at the roots. You should hold the hair on for anywhere between 10 and 20 seconds before you move on to the next section. If your curling iron has a clamp then roll your hair all the way around the barrel and use the clamp to hold it there.
 Gently use your fingers to extenuate the curls before you give it this final spray. Hopefully you're satisfied with the results and everything looks good. Don't forget to turn off the iron!

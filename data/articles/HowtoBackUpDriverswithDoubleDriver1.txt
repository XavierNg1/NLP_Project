A new window will appear. Click the Save button to download the software.
When the download is completed, open the file with WinZip.
In the zip file, there is a folder called "Double Driver." Double-click it, and then double click on "dd.exe." This will open the Double Driver program.;
, This will bring up a new screen that displays drivers you have backed up. No drivers will appear when you run the program for the first time.
 Click on the button "Scan Current Systems," found near the bottom of the screen. The program should complete a scan almost instantly. You will then see the names, versions, dates, providers and class of drivers in your system. The program will also select the drivers that are currently in use.



If you want to backup all of your drivers, simply click the arrow next to the "Select" button, under the "Backup" menu. You can choose to select all or select none. You can also choose the "Invert" option, which means that the program will back up all of the drivers that you leave unselected.
 You can choose to save drivers to either a structured folder, zip file or an executable file. Then hit "OK." Depending on how many drivers you are backing up and the output type you've selected, the process could take up to a few minutes.

 If you aren't using Outlook to manage your Gmail account, you can add it so that Outlook handles all of your Gmail messages. You can then use special features in Outlook to delay sending emails, allowing you to recall them if you'd like.


See Sync Outlook With Gmail for instructions on adding your Gmail account to Outlook.
 You'll find this in the Home tab, or in the Tools menu.
 This will open a new window where you can create your delayed sending rule.
 This will open yet another new window.
 This will tell Outlook that the rule you create will apply to all future outgoing messages.
 You can further define what messages your rule is applied to by selecting specific conditions, such as "with specific words in the subject." If you want the rule to apply to all messages, just click "Next" without selecting anything.
 This will enable you to delay your sent messages., This will allow you to define how long the messages should wait before sending.
 Make sure you give yourself enough time to change your mind.
 If there are certain types of messages that you never need to recall, you can add exceptions to your rule. If you want the rule to apply to all of your messages, click "Next" without selecting anything.
 Name the rule something like "Mail Delay" so that you can easily identify it later in case it needs changing or deleting.
 This will enable your new rule.
 Click the "New Email" button and compose and send your email like you normally would. It will be sent to your Outbox, where it will wait the amount of time you designated.
 All of the messages will stay in the Outbox until they've hit the delay time that you set in your rule. Once a message is sent, it leaves the Outbox and you cannot recall it.
 Select a message in your Outbox and click the red "X" button to cancel it. The message will be moved to your Trash folder, and you can drag it back to your Drafts if you want to make changes and send it again.

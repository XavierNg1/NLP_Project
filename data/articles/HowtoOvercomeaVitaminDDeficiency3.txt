 More serious cases of vitamin D deficiency might require high-dose therapy. Also known as stoss therapy, this method of treatment involves a total vitamin D dosage of 300,000 to 500,000 IU.Discuss factors like age with your doctor when considering stoss therapy. High-dose therapy has been linked with an increased fracture risk in older women., Severe cases of hypocalcemia, or calcium deficiency, can accompany vitamin D deficiency. Typically seen in infants under six months, hypocalcemia can cause seizures and lead to rickets, or soft, bent bones. An IV calcium supplement may be required and a patient should remain under close observation under calcium levels normalize., Your doctor will most likely recommend follow-up testing to gauge the treatmentâ€™s effectiveness. Annual tests might be required if you fall into a high risk category or have a condition that interferes with vitamin D absorption.Follow-up tests can also determine if your vitamin D levels are too high due to high-dose therapy. While vitamin D toxicity is rare, it can cause organ damage. Consult your doctor about stopping supplements until your vitamin D levels return to normal.

 You can use any type of milk you want, including low-fat, whole, almond, or soy. Whole milk or 2% milk will give you the most flavorful milkshake, however.If you only have skim milk, but would like something richer, add a splash of half-and-half or heavy cream.
For a thicker milkshake, use only Â½ cup (120 milliliters) milk. For a thinner milkshake, use 1 cup (240 milliliters) of milk.;
, If the ice cream is too hard to scoop, it will be too hard for your blender. Let it thaw on the counter for a few minutes until it is soft enough to scoop out., If you like your ice cream extra sweet, you can sweeten it further with some vanilla extract or sugar.You can use agave nectar, honey, maple syrup, or stevia instead., From time to time, pause the blender, and scrape the mixture down the sides using a spatula. This will help everything mix more evenly. If you want a thinner, frothier smoothie, blend it for a few more seconds., You can serve the milkshake as is, or garnish it with a swirl of honey or chocolate sauce.

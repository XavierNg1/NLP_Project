 If you are more of a visual learner, focusing on or drawing graphs, pictures, and/or mind maps will help you understand and remember concepts and ideas better. For example, if you are trying to remember a definition, look up images of the word in your search engine.
 If you are more of an auditory learner, record lectures to help you remember concepts and ideas. This way you can go back to the recording to help you understand your material better. You can also use rhyming and/or music to help you remember words, ideas, and concepts. For example, if you are trying to remember a definition, come up with a musical rhyme to help you remember the word and definition.
 If you are more of a kinesthetic learner, use your body and hands or focus on sensations to remember concepts and ideas. Also use physical objects as much as possible to help you learn. For example, use flashcards to help you memorize information because you can touch and move them around.Keep in mind that writing and drawing graphs are physical activities.

 You’ll also need ice, vodka, triple sec, and limes to make the shot. Ice is good for mixing the kamikaze. Use a shaker to best make the kamikaze shot. Some people enjoy using lime concentrate for convenience sake, while many argue that you should use fresh limes.


A good tool for an aspiring bartender or home entertainer is a double jigger. These come in two sizes: 1 ounce and ½ ounce or 1 ½ ounce and ¾ ounce.For a medium to large party, buy a liter of vodka and triple sec. For this size, you'll also need about a dozen fresh limes or a liter of lime juice.
 For the shot version of the drink, you’ll use less liquid to fit into a shot glass. You can measure either ½ ounce or ¾ ounce of vodka and triple sec. Again, a double jigger will help you measure out these portions equally.


Pour the two alcohols into the shaker.
 Use the portion used for the vodka and triple sec for the lime juice. It is best to squeeze fresh limes, instead of using store bought lime juice. Everyone has their own tastes and you should follow yours. Add the lime juice to the shaker.
 Add a scoop of ice to the shaker. Right after adding the ice, cap the shaker, and shake. Shake the concoction vigorously for about five seconds or more. It’s important to shake the mixture quickly so the ice doesn’t melt.
 Strain the mixture directly into a shot glass. Add a slice of lime to the edge of the shot glass for added presentation. It is best to take the shot right after being made because the drink is chilled just right.

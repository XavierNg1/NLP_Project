 Once your workspace has loaded, Flickr will need to be authorized.
 Once you click authorize, you will be taken to a webpage that you can choose to authorize it or not.
 After you have authorized it on the website, you will need to go back to the program and 'Complete Authorization'. This will take you to the screen where you will choose your images that you wish to upload.
 Click on the Green plus sign (+) to get to the screen for you to select images to upload.
 Since you have already authorized it, your image (or images) will be uploaded straight to Flickr. After that, you have the option of going to the location or not.

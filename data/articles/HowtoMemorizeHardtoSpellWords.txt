 If you try to learn a lot in a day it will be hard to memorize them. Review your previous lists regularly -after a day, after three days, after a week and after a month. Circle words you had difficulty with in pencil and add them to your current list.;
, If a word has '..ible' or '..able' at the end of it and you are not sure how it's spelled; do this for example, "I'm not sure how to spell learn-able. Oh I know ! I am i able to learn, yes! So I know that 'learn' has 'able' at the end!!"

, For example, if you are finding it difficult to pronounce 'bankruptcy', break it up - 'bank'+'rup'+'tcy'.
 An anagram is a sentence or phrase where the first letter of each word are the letters of the original spelling in logical order. Eg. Arithmetic = A Rude Idiot Thought He Might Eat Toffee In Church. Dictionaries sometimes have suggestions for commonly misspelled words and online sites, such as www.ssynth.co.uk/~gay/anagram.html‎, can help. It is suggested that you try to make one yourself as you are more likely to remember it.
 Choose good quality books that have advanced vocabulary. Regular exposure to the same words will improve your recognition of them and memory of their spelling.
 Put them on the door, on the fridge, on your desk - everywhere and anywhere! Every time you encounter the word, read the spelling and then cover it and practise until you have learned it off. This is a great way to overcome words that you really struggle with.

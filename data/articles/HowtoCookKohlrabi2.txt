 Slice the kohlrabi bulbs into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces, and cut each slice into 1-inch (2.5-cm) chunks.

Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger.
 Fill the saucepan with 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) of water and add a dash of salt.

Do not fill the pan with water any higher than this. If you use too much water, you could end up boiling the kohlrabi instead of steaming it. A low level of water will give you just enough to create steam.
 Cover the pan and bring the water to a boil over high heat.

The lid is necessary to trap the steam. The high heat is also necessary because it creates more steam at a quicker rate.
 Reduce the heat to low and let the kohlrabi steam for 5 to 7 minutes, or until soft enough to pierce with a fork.

Note that you can also steam the kohlrabi leaves, if desired. Steam the leaves as you would steam spinach, cooking them for about 5 minutes.
When done, drain the kohlrabi by pouring the contents of the saucepan through a colander.
 The steamed kohlrabi can be enjoyed hot and as is.

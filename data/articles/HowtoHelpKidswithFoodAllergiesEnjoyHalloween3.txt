 Halloween treats aren’t limited to candies and snacks. Kids also enjoy getting small toys and trinkets. For instance, you could offer spider rings, vampire rings, stickers, bouncy balls, or whistles.Many kids appreciate getting neat school supplies, too. Have some mini notepads, pencils, crayons, or markers available for trick-or-treaters with food allergies.
 If you offer just one candy for Halloween, or several treats that all have an ingredient (or ingredients) that are commonly associated with allergies, a child with food allergies will be unable to enjoy the snacks you provide. Try to have at least one treat that is free of the most common allergens (nuts, soy, wheat, eggs, fish, shellfish, and dairy).Kids love apple slices, bananas, and other fruits.
Other sweets and candies that you might consider offering include bubble gum, licorice, and gum drops.
Check the Safe Snack Guide at http://snacksafely.com/snacklist-20161030.pdf for a list of snacks free of various allergens.
Post a sign in your window to explain that if a child has allergies, they can ask you for a special alternative.
 The teal pumpkin is a universal symbol of an allergy-friendly trick-or-treat opportunity. You should also register your house on the Teal Pumpkin Project’s online map of homes that offer alternative Halloween treats. Visit the TPP database at http://www.foodallergy.org/teal-pumpkin-project/fever-map#.WBZfAfkrKUl.If you don’t have a porch, place your teal pumpkin on the stairs leading to your home, or in a window where it will be visible to trick-or-treaters.
Decorative teal pumpkins are available from many arts and crafts stores, or you could paint a regular pumpkin teal.

Skirts or dresses that are too short. If the skirt is anywhere above the knee then it is too short.






Clothing that is too tight. Clothes don't have to be overly baggy or ill-fitting to be "modest", but they should not cling to your body. It can be fitted but if the cloth has to stretch for you to put your hand under it, it's a bit too tight.






Shirts that are see-through. Pair these with a modest t-shirt or other top underneath if you wish to wear them. Use your best judgment.






Sleeveless shirts. Capped sleeves are okay, just no halter tops, or shirts with straps. (If you really want to wear a dress or shirt that has straps then a great alternative is to wear a cute coat or sweater over it. It will cover your shoulders and keep you modest. Just make sure to keep it on the entire time!)






Any shirt that is too low cut in the front or back. Also, it is inappropriate to wear t-shirts with slogans on them, especially to church. Also, don't wear any garments that have lots of skin showing or bra backs or straps. Also, no shirts that will expose your body when you bend over or lift your arms. (A good way to tell if the shirt is safe to wear is by doing Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes)






Don't wear flip-flops, beach-styled shoes, Running shoes, or sneakers. Dressy sandals are fine. You can still have fun with your shoes, wear heals or pumps, just don't make them too outlandish.. make sure you look nice!






Avoid looking overly casual. Wearing a dress or a shirt and skirt is the standard for church dress. If you don't have anything else then it is ok to wear your nicest pants.

Some Mormon gatherings are formal even if it is not on Sunday so check before you decide what to wear.
 As long as you dress modestly, anything else is basically up to you. Be yourself.

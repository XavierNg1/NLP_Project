 In order to make a sensory weighted toy, you will need:

A stuffed toy (such as a stuffed animal), preferably around 12 inches
Some small, heavy items, such as small rubber balls
Sharp sewing scissors or a seam tearer
Sewing needle and thread;
, Make sure that the hole is big enough to put your small objects through.,,, If there isn't room, don't panic - it's only a suggestion, not a necessity.,, Squish the toy to feel the items inside moving about, and lie down with the toy resting on you to feel the weighted effect!

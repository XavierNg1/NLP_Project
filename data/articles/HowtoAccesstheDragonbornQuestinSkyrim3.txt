 Even if you’ve downloaded the Dragonborn DLC, if you haven’t reached the “Horn of Jurgen Windcaller” quest, you cannot access the DLC.


The “Horn of Jurgen Windcaller” quest is part of the main story, so continue with the main storyline quests until you reach this on.
 Windhelm is a city northeast of Skyrim. As you head for the city, you might be assaulted by cultists (Method 1), but if not, continue your way to Windhelm.


Once you reach the outskirts of Windhelm, do not enter the city.
 You’ll find him around the docks, which is just outside the city area. He will be working on one of the ships moored there. Ask him to give you a ride to Solstheim.


Asking Gjalund for a ride will start the Dragonborn DLC quest.

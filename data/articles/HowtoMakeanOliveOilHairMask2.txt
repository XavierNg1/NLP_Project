 "Extra virgin" coconut oil is best, but any oil without added fragrances, flavorings, or colorings will do.Coconut oil is especially good for damaged hair because its fatty acid composition penetrates the hair shaft much more efficiently than most other oils.It's also an excellent treatment for dandruff and dry, itchy scalp and is a natural anti-fungal agent.


If you can afford it, raw organic coconut oil is the most effective oil to use on hair. Like raw honey, raw coconut oil may solidify in the jar; if so, microwave it for 10-20 seconds until liquified.Because this mask is so lightweight, it's perfect for fine or thin hair.
 Stir these oils together in a resealable glass jar. If you have short hair, 2 tablespoons of coconut oil and 1 tablespoon of olive oil should be plenty, but adjust the quantities as necessary according to your hair's length and thickness.
 Using your hands, massage the oil through your hair. Focus on the ends, as these tend to be the driest and most damaged. Comb through with a wide-tooth comb or your fingers.
 If you have long hair, put it in a ponytail or loose bun, then wrap with a shower cap, plastic wrap, or grocery bag.
 Leaving the coconut oil mixture in your hair overnight gives it plenty of time to penetrate even the most damaged hair shafts. In the morning, rinse out with warm water. Follow with a gentle shampoo and conditioner.

 Some good house plants are Wandering Jews, Peperomias, Chinese evergreens, and Hostas.;
,,,


You could name your plant based on one of its characteristics, like if it's green, you could name it Greenie, if it's spiky, Spiky,etc.
You could also try naming it a part of it's name, like a Wandering Jew could be Julia, a Chinese Evergreen could be Ever, and so on.
Or you could come up with a human name, like Frank, Donna, Bob, Eliza, or Amanda!

, Take a pot and paint it so it looks like a pet bed. Put your plant's name on the front. Then, fill it with soil and transplant your new buddy once it's ready.
 Go online and look up the specific needs of your plant, like ow often it needs to be watered, how much sun it needs, when to fertilize it, etc.
 Tell it about all your problems, all your joys, what happened at the mall today. Plants are awesome to talk to because they will never laugh or tell you mean things!

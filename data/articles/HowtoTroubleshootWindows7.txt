, You need to then click on "Properties", to view some major details about your computer and its hardware and operating system.
 The information we are looking for is pictured under the header “Windows Edition” near the top of the window. Make sure that you are using some sort of Windows 7 Operating System. Pictured above is “Windows 7 Ultimate” but this troubleshooting method will work on the Home Premium and Professional versions as well.
 Select “Control Panel” to view settings, and customize areas of your computer.
, Through this window, you can troubleshoot problems with incompatible programs, sound, mouse, and keyboard issues, internet connections, personalization of your Windows computer, as well as running maintenance tasks for the good of your PC.
, The options that are provided describe specific problems that your computer can diagnose, if you’re having a problem. Simply double click any of these option, and the troubleshooting wizard will open.
 All the troubleshooting wizards run in the exact same way, regardless of what specific problem you are trying to diagnose. The first step in running the troubleshooter is to simply press “Next” at the bottom of the window. This will start the troubleshooting process.
 If for any reason you would like to stop scanning for problems, click on the “Cancel” button at the lower right hand corner of the window.
 If you have already tried the solution presented, simply click “Skip this step,” and Windows will offer you another solution, and will eventually end, giving you a report of possible fixes.
 Windows will then check for problems again, as it did the first time you ran the wizard. If all goes well, you should see a window displaying that troubleshooting could not find any problems. In this case, you have diagnosed, and treated your computer’s problem, saving time and money in the process!

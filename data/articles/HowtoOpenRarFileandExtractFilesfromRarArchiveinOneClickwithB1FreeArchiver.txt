 Versions for Mac and Linux are available too. Then install the archiver on your computer or laptop. It’s just a few clicks, no registration is required. Run B1 Free Archiver from the “Start” menu. If you cannot find B1 icon in the “Start” menu, type “B1” in the search field below.;
, Let’s take “birthday party.rar” archive. Right-click on it to open context menu. Select “Extract here” option in the context menu to unrar files from the archive.
, Sometimes it's more convenient to unrar files into separate folder, especially when there are a lot of files in the archive. That way it's easier to find and view them later and avoid a mess in the original folder. It's still one click, instead of “Extract here” select “Extract to...” from the same menu.
 In our example - “birthday party”. With this option all photos are extracted from rar into new separate folder with name “birthday party” next to the archive.

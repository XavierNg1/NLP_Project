 The head of your golf club should rest on the ground while you are positioning the starting grip of your left hand. The grip of the club should rest across the palm of your left hand. The heel of your hand, where it connects to the wrist, should be even with the end of the handle.


If you find holding the end of the club even with the heel of your hand uncomfortable, you might improve your grip by leaving Â¼" (.64 cm) of the handle extending beyond the heel of your hand.;
, With the club still resting across your left palm and the heel of that hand even with the end of the club's grip, wrap your fingers around the grip. Your fingers should have no space between them, and your thumb should be lined up with the shaft.


The last three fingers (pinkie, ring, and middle) of your left hand will form the foundation of your grip. These fingers should be firm against the club.
The knuckles of your pinkie, ring, and middle fingers should be mostly visible while gripping the club in this fashion, when viewed from the side of the club opposite your left hand., Your pinkie finger will serve as the anchor for the grip of your right hand. You should place your right pinkie finger so that it fits snugly between the knuckle of the forefinger and middle finger on your left hand., Curl the remaining three fingers of your right hand around the grip so there is no space between your fingers. The thumb of your right hand should be positioned over the thumb of your left hand, so they are both in alignment along the length of the shaft.


Your hold on the club should be firm, but relaxed. Gripping the club too tightly can hinder your swing, while gripping too loosely may cause the club to fly free of your hands while swinging.

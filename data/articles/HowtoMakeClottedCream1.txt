 Clotted cream thrives on low heat over a long period.;
, Pasteurization is heating food, usually a liquid, to a very high temperature and then immediately cooling it down. The high heat lessens spoilage by preventing microbial growth, but a by-product of this is that the structure of the cream erodes, along with some of the taste. In order to get the tastiest clotted cream, stick with organic, high-fat, less pasteurized cream.
 The main thing to worry about here is how high up the sides of the pot the cream goes. Try to get it so that the cream comes up at least one inch and no more than three inches on the pot., Cover the pot with its lid and close the oven door. The cream may take as long as 12 hours to fully clot.


After 8 hours, the cream will develop a thicker, yellowish skin resting on top of the cream. This is the clotted cream. If you're checking on the cream in the oven, be careful not to puncture the clotted cream on top.
 Then, place the pan in the refrigerator and refrigerate for another 8 hours, being careful not to disturb the outer skin.
 Reserve the whey liquid for use in cooking or baking. (Buttermilk pancakes, anyone?)

, Store for three or four days in the refrigerator.

 If you are in a map you are not familiar with, you might as well be in the middle of nowhere with a gun.;
, Knowing what each gun is best used for is important if you don't want to die. For instance, you wouldn't shoot someone right next to you with a rocket launcher or shoot a tank with a pistol.
 This sounds stupid but you should always take aim at the best player and try to kill him/her more than the other players. This makes the other players scared of you and less likely to want to find you. That is, unless they have a sniper rifle.
 Have a cool and funny name like 'Pony Slayer' or 'Bullet on you'. If your name is your first name or something like 'Halo Dude', you probably won't be very scary.

 To create 70's waves, you should start with clean hair. Wash and shampoo your hair using a clarifying shampoo. Avoid any heavy shampoos or products, as these can weigh down your hair and interfere with the waves., Give your hair a light blow drying. Tilt the blow dryer away from your face. Blow dry your hair in upwards motion so the hair is being blown away from your face.Make sure to blow dry your hair in the direction of the hair shaft to prevent frizz.
You can part your hair in the middle or off to the side slightly, but avoid a deep side part for this look.
 After your hair is mostly dry, use a curling iron. Separate your hair into one to two sections and curl each section one strand at a time. Make sure the curls all point away from your face. This helps with the 70's look.If you have bangs, curl them as well.
 Once your curls are done, take a brush and run it through the curls. Starting at the roots, comb through the curls and tease your hair slightly. This will create volume. Use your fingers to flip your hair back further, creating a feathered look., Once your hair is curled to your liking, take some hairspray. Spritz on a light layer to set your curls and keep your hair shape in tact.If you dislike hairspray, you can use mousse or hair gel instead.

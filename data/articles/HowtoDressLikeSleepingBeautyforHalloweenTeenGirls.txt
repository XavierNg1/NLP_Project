 Sleeping Beauty was tall and thin; so you have to become thin to fit in her role.;
, Sleeping Beauty had clear skin; drink a lot of water' apply honey on face morning and evening, and have no dark circles.
 Sleeping Beauty actually had very light pink skin, which brings glow, because of a boon. But we normal girls don't have fairies to give us boons, so don't get tanned too much and apply as much sunscreen as you can.
 Sleeping Beauty was blonde. Â If you are blonde, well and good. But if aren't don't go crazy on coloring your hair or buying a blonde wig. You can look good in black, brown, red, hazel...etc. hair too.
 Because Sleeping Beauty had an ancient cut and if you have that cut you will look crazy.
 The skirt's length can vary on your which, from knee length to mini to micro minis. DON'T go for long skirts, you will look like a nun.
 Let the top be a bit tight. You can even buy a crop top or even wear a blouse! Go in tank-ini or a bikini top if you are comfortable!

Apply concealer on your under eyes, chin, and side nose.

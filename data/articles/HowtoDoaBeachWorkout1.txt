 Go down towards the water where the sand is packed. Warm up by doing a 10 minute jog or walk down the beach.;
, Start in a standing position with your feet together. Then, step your right foot in front and lower your body so that your knee is almost to the ground.


Rise up to your starting position and bring your left leg to meet your right leg. Step forward with your left leg. Keep your hands on your hips during this exercise and make sure your front knee never passes your toes.
 Keep a steady pace that allows you to recover your breath, but also keep your heart rate high. This is your "resting" period, so do a fast walk, if you are unable to jog.
 Find 2 markers on the beach, such as lifeguard stands. Sprint to 1 stand, touch the ground and sprint back.
 Stop and do 10 squats in place. With feet hip width apart, lower your butt till your thighs are almost parallel to the ground, and then slowly raise your body up.
 Stop and do 10 jumping jacks. Walk in place for 10 seconds, and then do 10 more jumping jacks.
 Stop and do 10 squat thrusts. Crouch down, place your hands in front of your knees, and then kick your legs back into a plank position.


Jump back to your original crouching position and stand up. Repeat this motion 10 times.
 The circuits should take about 5 minutes to complete. With a 10 minute warm up, the total cardio interval training with 4 rounds would take 30 minutes.

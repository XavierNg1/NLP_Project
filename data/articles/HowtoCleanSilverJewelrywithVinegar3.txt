 Pickling is a process that removes oxidation and residues from jewelry, such as after soldering or in order to clean a heavily tarnished piece. Start by obtaining some distilled water, since minerals in tap water may react with the acid in the vinegar., You will need a safety mask, such as a particulate mask, as well as safety gloves. In addition, you will need a pot or crock pot that you donâ€™t need for cooking, since it is not a good idea to use this pot for cooking afterwards., A great pickle (cleaning solution) can be made with distilled white vinegar, salt and distilled water. For every cup of distilled water, add one teaspoon of salt. Remember to add the vinegar to the water, rather than vice versa.
 Warm up the pickle to just before boiling. Add the jewelry to the pickle and let it soak until you see signs of improvement.
 Use a pair of tongues to remove the jewelry from the pot. Then, rinse it thoroughly. Dry it with a clean cloth.

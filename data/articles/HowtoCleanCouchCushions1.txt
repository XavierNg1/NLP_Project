 Different fabrics and materials require different cleaning agents. Additionally, some fabrics should be handled or cleaned in a particular way for best results, and some might even need to be dried a particular way. Some common fabrics used in couches include:


Cotton blend
Leather
Linen
Vinyl;
, The tags on your couch or couch cushions will usually provide you with advice as to what kind of fabric you are dealing with and how that fabric can be best cleaned.Some common abbreviations you might see on your tags include:


W: Use water-based detergent.
S: Clean with water-free products, for example, dry cleaning solvent.
WS: Either water-based cleaner or water-free cleaner is OK.
X: Professionally cleaning only, though vacuuming is acceptable., You'll want to remove all loose dust, hair, and any other crud that may have accumulated in the nooks and crannies of your couch cushions before using any kind of liquid cleaner. For most fabric types a vacuum cleaner can be used to remove dirt and hair.









Most vacuum cleaners have one or more upholstery attachments with a soft brush attachment. Make use of these for best results.If you lack a vacuum cleaner, unzip the cover, take it outside, and shake it thoroughly.
 Whenever you use a new cleaner or even a cleaning agent you are familiar with on a new piece of furniture, you should test it first. Choose a small spot that is out of sight and use a small amount of cleaner to see if it will damage the fabric.
 In most home supply or cleaning sections of stores you can find pre-wash cleaning sprays for furniture. Use these on your cushion and allow the spray to sit for as long as the label directs, or gently dab the stain with a damp sponge and mild detergent, allowing the solution to set for several minutes before moving on to the next phase in your cleaning efforts.
 If there is discoloration after rinsing, do not hand or machine wash. Take the cover to the dry cleaner instead.

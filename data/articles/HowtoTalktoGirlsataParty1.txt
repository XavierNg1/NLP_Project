 Before you walk up to a random girl, it's a good idea to scan the room and figure out what's going on. Look at the people at the party and figure out who came together. Find girls that look bored or have no one to talk to and consider talking to those girls first., Once you've found the girl that you want to start a conversation with, make eye contact before approaching them. Look in their direction and wait to lock eyes with them and smile. If the girl smiles back, you can approach them. If they look away or seem uninterested, you should approach a different girl., Once you get the girl's attention, approach her and strike up a conversation. Walk over to her and smile as you approach so that you put her at ease.

If she smiles back and makes eye contact, it's a good signal that she wants to talk.
Look at her arms and whether they are crossed. Crossed off arms indicate closed body language and she may not be interested in talking to you., If you've walked up to the girl and her body language says that she wants to talk, start up a conversation and introduce yourself. If they say hello back, there's a good chance that they want to talk to you.

Say something like "Hey, my name's Erin. I just saw you from across the room."

, After you ask her what her name is, make sure to remember it. Asking a question can open up a conversation with the person.

Good starter questions include "Having fun at this party?" or "Are you into the music they are playing tonight?"

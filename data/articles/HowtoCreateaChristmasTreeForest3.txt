 You can sell your Christmas trees wholesale or retail. Wholesale includes contacting established Christmas tree retailers or distributors in the area and selling off a significant portion of your lot for a discounted rate per tree. Selling retail, or directly to the consumer means that you'll have to open up a booth or storefront to cater to specific customer needs.


The upside to wholesale is that you can quickly offload all of your trees in one business transaction rather than invest time in selling it to individual buyers.
If you plan on selling wholesale, make sure that you contact local buyers before you plant your tree forest.
You will see a higher rate of return per tree if you sell retail, but you also run the chance of not being able to sell all of your trees before the holiday season is over.
 If you plan on selling retail, you'll need to build a business infrastructure around your tree sales that includes a stand or space for salespeople. If you are going to run a cut-your-own tree strategy, then you'll need the equipment in the form of a hacksaw or bone saw, as well as a mechanical baler to help transport the trees. For both retail and wholesale, you'll also need storage and loading areas to transport your trees.Infrastructure can also include the sales processes behind selling trees to the consumer.
 If you are selling trees directly the consumer you should invest into local and regional advertising in media avenues like newspapers, magazines, and online. When selling wholesale, make sure to establish industry connections before your harvest is fully grown. Lining up a list of buyers before your crop is finished growing will ensure that you can sell your trees if one buyer drops out.Offering perks like free tree delivery could create a competitive advantage for your tree farm.
Magazines that you can get advertisements in include, Christmas Trees Magazine, American Nurseryman, and Northwest Christmas Tree Association Buy-Sell Directory.

 In a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, horseradish, onion powder, dry mustard, celery salt, salt, and black pepper until well combined.


You will need to whisk for a minute or two until the sugar is fully dissolved by the liquid ingredients.
For this particular recipe, seasoned rice wine vinegar is the recommended vinegar option. If this is not available, however, you can substitute it with plain rice vinegar, white wine vinegar, or apple cider vinegar. If you have nothing but plain white vinegar, you can use that as well, but you should substitute it in proportions of three parts vinegar to one part water.;
, Taste test the dressing with a clean spoon and add more seasonings as needed.


Mind the consistency as you make alterations. An added dash of salt or pepper will not make much difference, but if you add much more lemon juice, vinegar, sugar, or mayo, the consistency might become thicker or thinner than it should be.
 For this dressing, it is recommended that you wait at least 1 hour before serving it with coleslaw so that there is adequate time for everything to reach the right temperature.


Fold your coleslaw mix into the dressing, thoroughly coating all the vegetables with dressing.

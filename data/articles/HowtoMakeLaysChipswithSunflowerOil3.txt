 Use a sturdy brush to scrub down the skin of the potato and remove any dirt or grim.
 If you look closely at Lay's you'll see that they still have some bits of thin skin attached. That said, you want to remove as much skin as possible.
 If using a mandolin, set it to the thinnest possible setting and carefully shave the potatoes into paper thin slices. If you're using a knife, know that this thin isn't quite possible -- you'll need to cook them a little bit longer.
 Use a gallon-sized resealable bag and shake until all of the potatoes are well coated.


You do not need to dry the chips like the other methods, as microwaves use this moisture to actually cook the potato.
 Take this parchment paper and place it on a plate in the microwave. If desired, sprinkle with extra salt or a little bit of black pepper.
 These chips cook quickly, so be ready to remove them once finished. The final time depends on the microwave's strength, the number of chips, and the placement in the microwave, so keep a watchful eye.
 If they aren't brown at all, they won't get crispy. If they get too brown, they will quickly burn. Keep your eye on them and remove as the start to crisp up -- they will cook just a bit more as they cool, so go a little on the early side.
 Since the chips can't be overlapping, you can't cook too many of them at once. Remove the first batch, set aside to cool, and get another batch going.

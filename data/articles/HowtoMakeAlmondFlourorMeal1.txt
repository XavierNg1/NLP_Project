 Any amount of almonds will do because the ingredients start and end with almonds. Nifty! Why blanched almonds for almond flour? Blanched almonds are simply almonds without their outer skin. These make for a more uniform-colored flour and a more even taste.









In order to blanch almonds, boil them for about a minute or two, uncovered. Use a cloth or your hand by rubbing the skin off or removing nut from the shell. Completely dry the almonds before using, as the water will make it into butter.
Why sprouted? Sprouted almonds simply mean almonds that are soaked overnight. They are easier for the human body to digest, making your overall experience more pleasant. Specifically, sprouting takes away toxic enzyme inhibitors so that the enzymes your body deploys during digestion can do their job.;
, Again, it doesn't matter how many almonds you use. It's probably better, however, to err on the side of fewer almonds, as almond flour has a relatively short shelf life â€” 3 to 6 months in the fridge and even less outside.
 This usually takes anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute, perhaps longer depending on your pulsing apparatus.









If you want finely textured almond flour, be sure to pulse the almonds a little longer. Be advised, however, that pulsing the almonds for too long can result in almond butter.
 Unused, room temperature almond flour can become rancid when it oxygenates for too long.

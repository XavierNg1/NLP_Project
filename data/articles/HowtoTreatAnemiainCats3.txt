 Mild anemia may not become noticeable until it has progressed to a more severe level.That is why it is important to take your cat for an annual checkup with a veterinarian to detect health problems early and treat them before they get worse. If you do not have a veterinarian where you take your cat, find one as soon as possible and take your cat for an initial appointment.
 Although cats are known to be a bit lazy, lethargy is not normal for a cat. If your cat is skipping meals because she is asleep, or you return home from work to find the cat in the same spot you left her, then your cat could be lethargic., A loss of appetite is another potential symptom of anemia in cats. Pay attention to how much your cat is eating. If she is eating less than is normal for her, then this may also indicate that your cat may be anemic., Pale gums indicate that your cat may be anemic.Your cat’s gums should be a rosy pink color, just like our gums. It is preferable to look at your cat’s gums in a room with natural lighting. Artificial lighting can give gums an artificial creamy or yellow tinge.


To look at your cat’s gums, gently lift the upper lip and look at the gums. If your cat has pale gums, then this is a sign that your cat may be anemic.
 If your cat has pale gums and/or other symptoms of anemia, you will need to take your cat to see a veterinarian. The vet will examine your cat and check for problems such as fleas, lice, or other parasites. The vet will also check for unusual organ enlargement or masses within the abdomen that could indicate that your cat has a tumor. The vet will then draw blood to run lab tests.The lab tests will look at the cat's biochemistry and hematology, an examination of the red and white blood cells. These lab tests can tell the vet if the cat is anemic, as well as determine the severity of the problem, tell whether the problem is recent or long-standing, and confirm whether the cat is making new red blood cells or not.

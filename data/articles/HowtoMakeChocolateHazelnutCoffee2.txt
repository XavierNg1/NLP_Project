 Add 1 14-ounce (396 ml) can of sweetened condensed milk and 1 ¾ cup (414 ml) of half and half to a medium size bowl. Stir well to ensure that they’re well combined.In some areas, sweetened condensed milk may be sold as condensed milk. It is evaporated milk that has been sweetened with sugar.
 Once the condensed milk and half and half are combined, stir 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of chocolate syrup, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of hazelnut syrup, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla bean paste into the mixture. Mix well until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.You can use homemade or store-bought chocolate syrup,depending on your preference.
Hazelnut syrup is typically found in the coffee aisle at the grocery store.
If you don’t have vanilla bean paste, you can substitute an equal amount of pure vanilla extract.
You can use this recipe as a base for any flavored cream that you like. Just mix in the corresponding syrup(s) in place of the chocolate and hazelnut.
 Transfer the creamer mixture to a airtight container that’s easy to pour from, and add the desired amount to a cup of hot coffee. Keep in mind that the more creamer that you add, the stronger the chocolate hazelnut flavor will be in your coffee.Make sure to refrigerate the creamer. It should keep for several days to a week.

 Not all calls get through, and when they don't, answering machines and voice mail are there to take the calls we miss. Because you don't know who might reach your machine, using proper phone etiquette is important.
 Your answering machine greeting at work should be handled much like you would handle a "live" call: "Hello, you've reached the office of Mr. Burns. Please leave a message, including your name, phone number, and time you called. If this is an emergency, please contact my assistant at 415-555-1234."

, You can say "Hi, this is Steve. I can't pick up the phone at the moment, but leave your name and number, and I'll call you back as soon as I can."


If you want to be more anonymous, you can say "Hi, you've reached 415-555-1234. There's nobody available to take your call, but leave your name and number and we'll get back to you."
Family options are flexible. You can answer for your whole family: "Hi, this is the Simpson family. Sorry we can't come to the phone right now, but leave a message and we'll call you back as soon as we can!"
You can also have the whole family speak (either as a chorus, or individually), but the essence should be the same: sorry we missed your call, we're not able to answer at the moment, please leave a message.
Whatever you do, avoid saying "We're not home right now," especially if you're not home! This lets potential troublemakers know they won't be disturbed as they "borrow" your TV, stereo, and jewelry.

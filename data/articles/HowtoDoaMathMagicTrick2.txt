 This trick only involves addition and subtraction, but some people get confused by the instructions. It works best on a friend who will pay close attention, and who is unlikely to make a math mistake.
 Announce that you'll write down a "magic number" on a piece of paper. Write down 1089 without showing anyone, then fold the paper in half.
 Tell him not to show you the number or tell you what it is. Make sure he understands that none of the three digits can be the same.


For example, he could pick 481.
He might need a simple calculator as well.
 On the next line underneath the number, he should write down the same digits in reverse order.


For example, 481 backwards is 184.
 Now that your volunteer has two numbers, have him subtract the smaller one from the larger one.


481 - 184 = 297.
 Now ask him if his number is two or three digits long, without telling you the actual number. If it is only two digits long, have him place a 0 at the beginning.


In our example, 297 has three digits, so you can skip this step. Sometimes your friend will end up at 99, and this step will turn that into "099."

, Ask him to take his answer and reverse the digit order again. If he added the zero the beginning, remind him to include it as part of the number.


For example, the reverse of 297 is 792.
 As the final calculation, your friend adds the last two numbers he wrote down.


In our example, 792 + 297 = 1089.
 Announce that you know the last number he wrote down. Unfold the piece of paper and reveal the 1089 you wrote down earlier.

The answer is always 1089. If your friend has a different answer, he did not follow instructions, or he made a mistake.

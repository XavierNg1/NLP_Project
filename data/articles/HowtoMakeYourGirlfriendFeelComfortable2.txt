 Usually, the more you know someone, the more comfortable you are around them. Get to know her well, and let her get to know you well. This will make your relationship more comfortable for her.
 There's nothing more embarrassing for a girl than when her boyfriend tells everyone that she's "his," followed by an offensive term, or that he'll "get her in bed tonight." Don't say these things to or about anyone. It's okay to compliment her beauty, but don't make sexual references when you're talking about her looks, as this is embarrassing for girls. Keep your intimate relationship details private, unless she tells you otherwise. Avoid teasing her in front of peers, and never ignore her., Communication is everything, so if you have an issue with something your girlfriend said or did, it is important to discuss this with her rather than give 'the silent treatment' or treat her in another immature way., It is possible that your girlfriend is uncomfortable around you simply because she's afraid that you'll force her into doing something she doesn't want to do. This may include anything from kissing, smoking, doing drugs, touching, or having sex to getting tattooed or drinking alcohol. Make sure not to pressure her into doing anything that she may not be ready to do!, Never assume that someone is okay with getting physical, even if they had expressed interest at an earlier time. Ask, "Can I give you a hug?" Check in with your girlfriend frequently during sexual activity. Ask, "Is this okay?" and "How does this feel?" If you show that you care and respect her, then she will give honest answers and the trust in your relationship will strengthen.

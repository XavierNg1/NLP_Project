 Mix a solution that’s 3-to-1 water to baking soda in a shallow bowl until the soda dissolves. It will have the texture of a loose paste. Open your oven, and spread this mixture on the glass of your oven door. You can use your fingers to spread it on every bit of the glass., The baking soda mix will begin to loosen the stuck-on grime on your oven glass. Set a timer for 15 minutes.
 After the baking soda mask has had a chance to soften some of the splatters on your oven door, scrub the mixture with a kitchen sponge. Use the rough side to loosen as much of the stuck-on food as possible.
 Rinse your sponge and wipe up the baking soda mixture, working from one side to the other. Periodically, rinse and wring the sponge, until you’ve cleaned up all traces of baking soda.
 Use a clean, dry dishtowel to dry your oven door. If there are any remaining traces of baking soda, use a damp sponge to wipe them up and re-dry those areas.
 For sparkling, clear oven glass, use a commercial glass and window cleaner, such as Windex, to give the glass one last wipe. Spray some of the cleaner on a paper towel and wipe from side to side. There is no need to dry again. Your oven is now ready for use as normal.

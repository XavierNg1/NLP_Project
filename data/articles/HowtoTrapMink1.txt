 Minks travel more than most furbearers, covering up to ten miles a night. They normally follow a definite route. They will usually visit the same spots near water areas every time they are near them. Learning a mink's travel habits will make it easier for you to trap it.;
, Live traps catch the mink without killing it. Lethal traps dispatch the mink. When selecting the type of trap you are going to use, decide if you want to deal with an alive and probably very irritated mink or if you want the trap to dispatch the mink.


Check your state regulations regarding using lethal traps on minks.
 The set is what you will use to lure the mink into your trap. The most common sets either lure the mink to a dark hole using bait (pocket set) or trap the mink on its pathways (blind set).
 There are different types of traps to choose from based on the environment. A body-gripping trap is designed to allow the animal’s head, neck, or torso into the trap’s opening. This trap holds the mink by compressing its jaws around the body. The foothold trap, such as the longspring or coilspring, is a steel-jawed trap that restrains mink by the foot.


Use a No. 11 double longspring, No. 1 ½ coil spring, or a No. 110 Conibear body-gripping trap. These traps are the most effective in trapping and killing the mink.

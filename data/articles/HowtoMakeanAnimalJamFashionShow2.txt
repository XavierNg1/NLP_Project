 Yell out: "Fashion show in my den!" Repeat it a couple of times. When you feel you have yelled enough, say, "Last call!", and go to your den. Don't make it too crowded!

, Do however many themes the people are in there, minus one. Make it hard, so they can be more creative. Judge them on what they wear, what animal they are, and what they are., Who wants to be the Judge, and who wants to be the Model.
 Some themes that everyone can do include: Dress Scary, Silly, or Nerdy.


If you have lots of members, do stuff like Dress Girly, Shiny, or Epic!

, Check that all participants are wearing trendy threads. If not, say, "Excuse me, but your attire is not suitable for this show."

, The loser is the only one out. The winner goes to the fashion finals.
 Say a theme, and pick losers only, until there is one left. If wanted, award them with a prize.

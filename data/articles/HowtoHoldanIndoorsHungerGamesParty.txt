 Use Hunger Games themes to make the invitations from. Write the date, place and time on each one.


If people are to come dressed in Hunger Games costumes, include this as a request.;
, You can probably use classy, expensive looking food (reminiscent of the Capitol food), or just put the food in beautiful dishes. Perhaps serve a small chocolate fountain, cupcakes (in memory of Peeta) and a really amazing cake.


Avoid popcorn, pizza and other usual things.
 Get Hunger Games posters, fake bows and arrows, Hunger Games cups and balloons.


Make party favor bags filled with Hungry Games favors and trinkets for the guests to take home after the party.
 Think of suitable things you and your friends can do, like karaoke, dancing competitions, cupcake decoration, Hunger Games drawing contests, etc.


Consider having a contest to see who has worn the best Hunger Games costumes.
Consider showing the DVD of at least one of the movies.
 Instead of killing each other, give all players three minutes to hide around the house. Decide which areas form part of the game and which are off limits, such as your parent's bedroom.


The basement is probably the best bet, as there will be a lot of rushing around and bumping things.
 Wherever is included in the game, hide things like compasses, water bottles, bottles with a life in it (put a piece of paper saying "You have got another life" inside), snacks and other things, which can help players through the Hunger Games.


Put away all breakables, such as vases, sculptures, etc.



For effect, you could even make an arena with plastic human figures and places people can shoot arrows.
 When the three minutes are over, the game begins. Players will have to shoot other players with Nerf guns or fake bow and arrows. Hit in head or chest costs a life, on feet or hands half life. Unless a person has a "new life" piece of paper.
 The last person left declares victory and gets the biggest slice of birthday cake.

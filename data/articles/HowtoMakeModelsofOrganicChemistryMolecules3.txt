 This method is best if you want to study the actual geometry of the bonding. It also works for isomerism. Use Plasticine or any modelling clay that does not dry by itself; it is important that the material does not dry, or your model will not hold together very well.Roll pieces of Plasticine into balls.
 Use them to connect the atoms together to make molecules.


For carbon, make sure the 4 bonds are tetrahedrally orientated as in the image below (of ethane.)
For other atoms, look up which atoms are used to bond to them, and find out the bond angles.

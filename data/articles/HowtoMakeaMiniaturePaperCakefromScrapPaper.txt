 You can use newspapers, tissue paper, pages of notebook or any other paper. Tear it into small pieces. Keep the torn pieces inside a small bowl or a plastic glass.;
,, Mix the ingredients well. This is very similar to making a real cake, where the paper acts as flour, water as the eggs and talcum powder as baking powder!


The amount of talcum powder depends on how much paper mixture there is. Add gradually, until a good paste like consistency has been formed.
 This will help the observer to guess at the flavor of the cake. For example, orange color for orange cake, brown for chocolate cake and white for vanilla cake. This will act as food colouring.
 For example, you could use a heart shape mould, a circle mould or a square mold, depending on the person you're giving the paper cake to.
, For best results Let it dry for four complete days. Do not take out the mixture from the mould before three days have passed.
 Take a health drink packet and cut the bottom edge in the shape of one fourth of a circle. Wrap a rubber band or a thread around to close the bag. Make a small hole at the tip of the bag.
 Then mix it all together well. Choose the poster color according to the color of the cake, or according to your preference.
 Close the bag with either a rubber band or thread.
 Create beautiful patterns on the cake. Let the cream dry for 1-2 days.
 Once the cream has dried on the cake, you can add additional decorative elements if wished, or leave it as it is. Once everything has dried completely, the cake is ready to give as a gift or use as a decoration. It's delicate, so be sure to place it on something firm, such as a plate for display or inside a little box for gifting.

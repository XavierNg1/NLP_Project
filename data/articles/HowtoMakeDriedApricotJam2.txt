 Wash the apricots. Chop roughly.
 Cover with warm water and let soak for a minimum of 8 hours.
 Add the lemon juice and some zest.
 Reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, taking care not to burn the apricots. Leave uncovered and stir frequently. When the apricots are soft, move to the next step.
 Once cooked, add the warmed sugar to the soft apricots. Bring to the boil again, stirring constantly. Cook until the sugar dissolves.
 Cook for another 30 minutes or until the jam reaches setting point. Keep an eye on the pot to prevent burning; you can stir occasionally if needed.


If scum rises during cooking, skim off.
 Add the almond slivers and stir through. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes.
 Stir the apricot jam, then transfer to the jars. Seal and label.
 The jam will be ready for eating after 2 weeks of sitting.


This jam keeps for up to 6 months but should be refrigerated upon opening.

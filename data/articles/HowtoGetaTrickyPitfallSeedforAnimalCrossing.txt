 The only way to find a Tricky Pitfall Seed is to happen upon it in your town’s Lost and Found. Your town won’t have a Lost and Found unless you’ve built the police station.


The police station is a public works project. It won’t be available to you right away. You have to wait until one of your citizens suggests it, and then you can start building.;
, The Lost and Found is updated frequently. You should always take items out of it that you want. This keeps the space open for new items.
 Eventually, you will notice a Tricky Pitfall Seed in the lost and found. Grab it! It will look different from the regular pitfall seeds in that it will be black instead of white.
 To bury the seed, equip your shovel, dig a hole, and drop your seed in.


Once you’ve buried it, you will be able to see the difference between it and regular pitfall seeds. The Tricky Pitfall Seeds leave a much smaller star on the ground, making them harder to see and avoid.
Once buried, you can wait around and hopefully see someone fall in!
This can be even better for online play with friends.

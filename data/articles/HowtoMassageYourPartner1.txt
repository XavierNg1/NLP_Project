 The best place to give your partner a romantic massage is on the floor, as a bed can be too springy.


Lay a duvet or a soft blanket on the floor.
You can also have your partner sit in a chair, a la the massage scene between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore in the film Ghost.Keep some small pillows close by to ensure your partner is lying comfortably during the massage.;
, If you have access to an indoor fire, get it going to warm up the room. Look for music you know your partner would enjoy or music you find soothing and calming.
 The most popular massage oil is sweet almond oil as it glides easily on the skin, doesn’t get absorbed too quickly and is thin and light. Other oils like olive oil, coconut oil, grapeseed oil, avocado oil also work well for a massage.Each of these different oils offer unique therapeutic benefits that can enhance and improve the effects of a certain type of body massage.To warm up the oil, pour the oil into a metal container and place it in a pot of water on the stove. Turn the stove to low heat and let the oil warm up.You can also rub the massage oil between your hands right before the massage to warm up the oil.
Always check the temperature of the oil to ensure it is not too hot before you use it for the massage. You don’t want to burn your partner’s skin and turn a sensual experience into a painful one!

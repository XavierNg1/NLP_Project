 There are lots of possibilities but here are some great ones to get you started:


Wash the car/dog/siblings/paths/clothes, etc.
Babysit your younger siblings on a Saturday night to let them have a night (or more) out
Clean your room weekly for a year (yes, a big gift!)
Take out the garbage/clean out the trash can
Do some gardening (especially weeding)
Do the grocery shopping
Take your parents on an adventure hike/treasure hunt;
, Perhaps you only want to do it once, or maybe you'll do it for a month, or a week, or every six months. Be generous!

, If you make a booklet, do you want to provide the same service several times, or a variety of services? Think about how much time you will need to spend doing these things when your parents ask!

, You are free to be as creative as you'd like - draw them, design and print on the computer, color them in, etc. If you are making a booklet, think about how you will assemble this. If you make it look like a little raffle ticket book, this will be fairly straightforward: Simply cut two pieces of thick card for the front and back covers, make your vouchers the same size and cut to shape, place all together, and staple into place. Add any designs and messages to the cover that help show it's a book of redeemable vouchers.

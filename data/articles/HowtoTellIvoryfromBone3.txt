 Antiques dealers have handled hundreds or thousands of ivory, bone, and plastic pieces, and they're usually quite adept at figuring out which is which using the methods outlined above as well as their own knowledge about the ivory trade.

Be sure to find a reputable dealer to appraise the item. Don't go into just any antique store; find a place the specializes in ivory so you can be sure the information you get is correct.
Antiques shows are a good place to get items appraised. Check online to find out whether a show will be coming to your area.
 To leave absolutely no question about the composition of your ivory or bone item, take it to a forensics lab and have it chemically tested by a scientist. The cellular structure of ivory is different from that of bone, but lab equipment is required to determine which is which with finality.

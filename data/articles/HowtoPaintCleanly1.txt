 Preparation is an important part of your plan to paint cleanly. You should take certain steps each time you paint to reduce the chance of mishaps.


Spread heavy drop cloths over the entire floor area. Don't substitute plastic covering to protect floors; it tends to bunch up when walked on.
Move lighter furniture out of the room you're painting.
Move heavy furniture to the center of the room and cover it completely with plastic covering.
Remove all wall decorations and area rugs.
Take down curtains and curtain rods.
Use masking tape to protect the trim and windows, door frames and baseboards. Also tape off fixtures that you can't remove.
Remove wall plates from electrical outlets and light switches.
Keep the area around the surface you're painting clear of all obstructions.
 You can take steps to greatly reduce the number of accidental spills. These steps differ depending on the method you use to paint.


Roll off excess paint on the roller grid. Drops of paint can go unnoticed and set in on surfaces.
Don't allow the roller to spin after each stroke. Spinning rollers often splatter paint in all directions.
Use a can roller grid instead of a separate pan. Grids that attach inside the paint can reduce paint splatter and also eliminate the need for pans. Pans tip over easily and people may accidentally step in them.

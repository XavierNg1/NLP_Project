 What you need to buy is a gel cleanser, a facial scrub, a moisturizer, and a spot treatment or cleansing pads. Optional things to get are at-home facials, pore strips, eye creams, and special washcloths/cleansers.
 Get a body wash for the shower, and optionally a loofah to go with it. Also look for a high-quality daily body lotion. Pick up some shaving cream and either a disposable razor or the kind that you need to replace just the heads on. If you prefer to, pick up a cream to remove hair. Wax is the best option for eyebrows, but if you get it done professionally, pick up some tweezers as well. Deodorant, perfume, tampons,body sprays and nail kits and lip balm are essentials.
 Such as mousse, gel, straightening/curling balm, etc. You should get a new brush and/or comb every 6 months or so, so go ahead and buy a wide-toothed comb and quality hairbrush, and a pack of bobby pins and hair ties and headbands . If you don't already have one, you might want to pick up a flat iron and heat protectant spray.
 And if you have braces, either get them in a discreet or cute color. Just no yellow, dark green, or orange. Don't get white, either. The comparison to your teeth will make your teeth look more yellow!

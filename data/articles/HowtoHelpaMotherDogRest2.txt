 Mothers who've just given birth may run into complications, such as infection or low calcium. Often, that means she's not able to feed the puppies herself. In that case, you will need to hand feed the puppies while the mother recovers, and you may need to hand feed the puppies for good., You'll need bottles made specifically for puppies to feed from. You'll also need a commercial formula designed for puppies. While you can make homemade formulas, these formulas are not balanced as well as the commercial ones., You can mix up enough formula for a day, but make sure to keep the extra in the refrigerator. Follow the directions on the package for mixing, then heat the mixture to 98 to 100 °F (36.7 to 37.8 °C) by placing it in a pan of water. Also, make sure to thoroughly clean the bottle and nipple each time you feed the puppies., When feeding, the puppy should be on its stomach. In the first three days, feed the puppy every two hours. After that, you can move to every three hours, with four-hour periods at night. The second week, you can change to four-hour stretches during the day and six-hour periods at night.When the third week comes around, you can start moving to solid food, puppy mush, though you still need to be bottle feeding regularly.

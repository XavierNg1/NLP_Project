 Though there are only a few places in the world where you can see tigers in the wild, these places are sometimes open to travelers. If you’re visiting a place in which tigers freely roam, hire a guide to help ensure a safe journey.Often, organizations interested in the well-being of wild animals will provide you with information to inform you of how to behave safely in certain areas and avoid dangerous situations.
 If a tiger has not noticed your presence, try to get away before it sees you. You are more likely to attract attention by moving, so simply wait until the tiger has moved on of its own accord. Once it has, move safely but deliberately towards safety, ideally in the opposite direction., Stated otherwise, don’t pee in a tiger’s domain. An innocent bathroom break may be interpreted by a tiger as an act of aggression, and they may perceive you as a threat if you urinate in their territory. As a general rule of thumb, always ensure that you are well hydrated and have visited the bathroom before you walk into Tiger territory. , If you’re somewhere – such as the Ganges Delta in India – where people are regularly attacked and killed by tigers, consider wearing a backwards-facing mask. Rear-facing masks trick tigers, which prefer to sneak up on potential prey.By fooling the tiger into thinking you have eyes in the back of your head, you may prevent yourself from becoming its next meal.
Even when tigers have been observed stalking humans, they do not attack people wearing a two-faced mask.

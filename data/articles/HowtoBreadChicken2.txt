 Rinse the chicken breasts, cut away any excess fat, then pat them dry with a paper towel. Pound them into cutlets or cut them into smaller pieces, depending on your method of cooking and recipe.
 Get a large, sturdy, Ziploc bag that's large enough to hold 1 gallon (3.8 liters). The bag must be sturdy, otherwise it may rip during the next few steps.
 Crack the eggs into a small cup first, then beat them with a fork until they turn pale yellow. Pour the beaten eggs into the bag right over the chicken breasts.
 Zip the bag shut firmly, then shake the bag to coat the chicken. You can also move the chicken breasts around with your fingers, turn the bag upside down, or toss it around. Make sure that the chicken breasts are evenly coated.
 Plan on using about 1Â½ cups (135 grams) of bread crumbs. It is better to use too much and have some left over than not using enough and getting a clumpy mess. If you want fancier breaded chicken, add in some seasonings, such as salt, dried herbs, or grated Parmesan cheese.
 Be careful not to touch the chicken breasts too much during this step, even through the bag. This will prevent the bread crumbs from accidentally rubbing off. Keep shaking the bag until the chicken breasts are evenly coated with bread crumbs. Don't worry if you have some crumbs left in the bottom of the bag.


Discard any left over mixture. Do not reuse it.
 Use a pair of kitchen tongs to pull the chicken breasts out of the bag. You can cook them by frying or baking. Make sure that you could them thoroughly; chicken is not like beef and must be fully cooked.

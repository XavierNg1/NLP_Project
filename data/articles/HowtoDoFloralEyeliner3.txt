 Flower eyeliner is very attention grabbing. You should keep other makeup minimal when wearing it. Add only a light layer of foundation after applying floral eyeliner., A single coat of mascara is all that is necessary for liquid eyeliner. Too much mascara, or something like false eyelashes, can take attention away from your floral liner.Go slower than you usually would when applying your mascara. This can help prevent you from smearing your flower shapes.
 Filling in your waterline will help your eyes pop and make them look bigger and more defined. Choose a colored eyeliner if you used floral eyeliner. This will give your eyes a floral, spring look. Opt for a color that's the same or similar to the one of the colors you used for your flowers.

 You'll need a container to mix and keep your sugar scrub in. This recipemakes about 2 1/2 cups of scrub, so you'll want to find a container big enough. Alternatively you can split the scrub between several smaller containers or halve the recipe.
 Pour 3 tablespoons of coconut oil into your container.


You can also add 1-2 gel caps of vitamin E oil if you want to make this scrub even better for your skin. Simply piece the cap and squeeze it into the oil. If you do this, however, make sure you let the scrub soak on your skin for a few minutes before rinsing it off.
 Now, add in 2 tablespoons of honey. Any kind will do, but the thicker the honey is, the better.
 Pour in 1/2 cup of real sugar. This can be any sugar but raw sugar will be the most harsh while white sugar will be the least harsh. Brown sugar falls somewhere in the middle.
 Now that you have all of your ingredients in the container, mix everything together. If it seems to wet, you can add more sugar. If it's really dry, try adding half a spoon of oil.


Store the finished product out on your counter or in a cupboard. Putting it in the fridge will only make it go turn hard.

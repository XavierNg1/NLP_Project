 If you plan to use the lemons within a few days of purchase, store them away from direct sunlight. They typically stay fresh for about one week at room temperature. After this point, they start to wrinkle, lose their vibrant color, and develop soft or hard patches., Place the lemons in zip-locked bags, squeezing out as much air as you can. In this state, the lemons may retain most of their juice and flavor for as long as four weeks.The ideal temperature for storing ripe (yellow) lemons is between 4º and 10ºC (39–50ºF). For most refrigerators, the middle shelves or door shelves are around this temperature.

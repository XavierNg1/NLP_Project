 According to the directions on the cake mix box, preheat your oven. The box will usually call for preheating the oven to about 350 degrees.
 Use a nonstick spray like Pam to grease your pan. Spray a light layer on the bottom and all four sides, making sure that there is an even coating.


Once the pan is greased, sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of flour in the pan. Gently shake the flour around the pan until the bottom and the sides of the pan are coated with the flour.
, Pour the pumpkin puree into the mixing bowl and stir it together with the cake mix. Make sure to get out all of the lumps so that you have a smooth, clump-free batter.


Note: The pumpkin puree works best with a white or a yellow cake mix.The flavor of the pumpkin will be diminished if you use a chocolate or other strong-flavored cake mix

, Pour in the water and mix it with the pumpkin puree and the cake mix until the mixture is well blended.
 Pour the mixture into your cake pan and put it in the oven. Bake the cake as directed on the box, usually about 30 minutes.
 Make sure you let the cake stand for at least 15 minutes once you are done baking it. This will give the cake plenty of time to cool down before you try to eat it.

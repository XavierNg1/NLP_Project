 If you need to, draw a cutting guide using a pen and ruler first. This will create a gap in the bracelet so that you can take it on and off.;
, These will be your bracelets. You can make them as narrow or as wide as you'd like. Something between 1 and 2 inches (2.54 and 5.08 centimeters) would work great.
 Starting at one end, wrap the tape around the bracelet like a candy cane. Make sure that you overlap each layer slightly so that the cardboard doesn't show through.You can find washi tape in the scrapbook section of most arts and crafts stores. It comes in lots of different colors and patterns.
You can also use colored or patterned duct tape. Simply lay it across the top of the bracelet, then cut off any excess., You can get really creative here. You can wrap a contrasting color in a loose spiral around the bracelet for a candy cane effect. For something simpler, lay down a strip of washi tape lengthwise down the middle of the bracelet. You can also decorate the bracelet with stickers.
 If you have thicker wrists, the bracelet may not stay on very well. Use a hole puncher to punch a hole on each end of the bracelet. Thread a short piece of pipe cleaner through both holes. Bend each end of the pipe cleaner into hooks so that it stays in place.Use a color that matches your bracelet.

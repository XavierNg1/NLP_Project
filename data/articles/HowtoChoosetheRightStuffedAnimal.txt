 There are many possibilities in a stuffed animal, such as:


Are you looking for a spotted animal, or a solid-colored animal?
Are you looking for a squishy animal, or a more solid animal?
Are you looking for a plushie, a knitted, a furry, a plastic?
Do you want a very big animal you can sit on or a small animal to put in your pocket?;
, There are many choices, from giraffes and kangaroos to the common teddy bear. Most common animals include:


Teddy bears
Dogs
Cats.
 You don't have to get one of those if you want to be different. You could get a monkey, a lion or even an octopus! If you really like dogs or cats, try getting one that looks like your favorite breed. You could have a bright green snake with a colourful pattern, or a moose with bells on its antlers, or a hyena with gold and orange streaks.
 Sometimes the best animals are ones that have been stitched up and redecorated. It makes them look edgy, interesting and unique (personalize it, because it will be identical to the ones from the store) . If you want a new animal try a toy store. Ask around friends if they have any old stuffed animals they are willing to give to you. Always check for stains or rips before buying. Don't buy a stuffed animal that is too expensive.
 Don't go with something anyone would name their stuffed animal, like "Rover" for a dog, "Simba" for a lion, or "Bananas" for a monkey. Use words from a different language or name it after a family member or past pet. Choose a name that suits him/her.
 Purchase them or make clothes at home. You can also give accessories to your stuffed animal, like purses and collars.
 Take an old shoe box or use the corner of your room. Add some decorations and make/buy some big doll furniture. Get old towels and scraps of fabric or felt to make a bed. Also make or buy some toys for your stuffed animal. You can also use dog or cat toys.

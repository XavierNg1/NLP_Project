 Swamp coolers are rated by how much air the cooler can move, and is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM).

Multiply this figure by the height of your ceilings.
Divide that number by 2 (120 for European measurements).
The result is the CFM rating for the evaporative cooler you need.
For example: If you have a 1,500 square foot home with 8 foot (2.4 m) ceilings:

1,500 square feet x 8 feet (2.4 m). ceilings = 12,000 ÷ 2 = 6,000 CFM.
You need a unit rated at 6,000 CFM or higher.


Example 2, in CMS (cubic meters per second): If you have a 140m2 home with 3m ceilings:

140m2 x 3m ceiling = 420 ÷ 120 = 3.5 centimeters (1.4 in).
You need a unit rated at 3.5 centimeters (1.4 in) or higher.

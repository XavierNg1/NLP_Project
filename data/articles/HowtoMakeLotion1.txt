 Every lotion is a bit different (that's part of the reason there are so many varieties available in stores) and there is no wrong way to go about making it. For this basic concoction, you'll need:









2-3 tbsp (30-45 g) distilled water (or substitute aloe vera gel)
1/2 cup (4 oz) grapeseed oil (or coconut, jojoba, etc.)
2 tbsp (30 g) beeswax
Vitamin E oil or capsule
Essential oil(s) (a few drops ought to do it);
, Do this slowly -- you don't want to scorch your materials. Patience will result in a better product.









Some schools of thought suggest using a double boiler -- if you have the means, this is a good, safe method of melting.
 Place the mixture into a large glass bowl. Don't wait to do this -- if your mixture overcooks, it may not form.









Your pan will clean with soap and water; don't worry. Soak it now to go easy on your scrubbing elbows (or dishwasher).
 For a thicker, more butter-like consistency, add less water. Mix with a hand mixer until your scented potion becomes thick.









Rose water is also a good alternative to distilled water, if that matches the scent you are aiming to produce. It's easy to find in grocery stores, too.
 It needs time to thicken up and congeal. It does not have to be covered or moved to a cool area -- simply leave it on the counter and walk away.









When adequate time has passed and your lotion has formed, scoop 'er into a glass jar or other lotion-worthy container. Throw a tag on it and wrap it up for a personal, thoughtful gift!

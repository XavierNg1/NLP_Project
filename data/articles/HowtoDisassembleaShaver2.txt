 Simply turning it off is not enough. The last thing you (or we) want is for an electric current to be running through the shaver while you poke and prod its insides with metal tools.


If the shaver runs by battery, you do not need to worry about this, but it should still not be plugged in.
 If you can see that the shaver, or any part of it, is held together by screws, then this should be rather easy.


Simply find the appropriate screwdriver and turn the screws counter-clockwise to remove them.
 If you have unscrewed the blade, remove it carefully and without touching the sharp edge of the blade. If you have unscrewed the body of the shaver, pull the two halves apart slowly and carefully.

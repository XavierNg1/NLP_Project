 Write things down, and sketch phrases that you think or feel strongly about. Anytime you find something that inspires you, write it down, or when you feel inspiration, try to sketch it. By doing this, you can then access when and how you felt inspiration - and hopefully create the pattern of feeling it again.;
, Reading books can feed your brain, and help you collect thoughts that can expand into ideas. A good suggestion for a book is 'Inspiration' from Barnes & Nobles, and look at pictures and paintings. Art ideas inspire more art ideas. Books in general can give you new ideas, and make you think about things you hadn't considered before. A new idea from a book can give a multitude of inspirations.
, Try to make it a point every day to find inspiration in all five senses - in seeing, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.

Consider stopping to smell the roses; quite literally. Look at flowers in a living garden.






Watch a beautiful sunset/sunrise, to inspire you.






Listen to inspirational music, or nature sounds - whichever suits you better. Experiment with different ideas to see what helps you along the path to inspiration.
, If you're tense, your natural ability will freeze up. In addition, your mind will be cluttered with overly fast-paced thoughts and even anxieties.
 Write for the sake of writing. Draw for the sake of drawing.
 When your ideas aren't all jammed in your head, it feels like you'll have room for more.
 Two minds are better than one, and 3 or 4 are even better.
 Pick anywhere where you can easily chill and do your thing all at once.
 Without adequate rest, your brain won't fully repair from both the physical, emotional, and especially the mental actions of the day.

, A state or district, such as District of Columbia, may have a general sales tax of 6%, but set the tax rate on liquor and prepared food at 10%.New Hampshire, for example, has no general sales tax but still taxes prepared food at 9%.
Massachusetts, for example, only starts counting sales tax associated with clothing when the bill exceeds $175. So if you buy under $175 worth of clothing in Massachusetts, the state government won't tax it.
 We don't often talk of "city sales tax," but it's there. Most people, however, just lump it in with state sales tax. If you want to know exactly how much money you'll pay in taxes for a certain item, check your local state and city tax laws for more information

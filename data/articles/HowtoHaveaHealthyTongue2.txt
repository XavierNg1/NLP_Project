Drink at least six eight-ounce glasses of water a day to reduce bad breath.Avoid sipping water in small doses as this may actually wash away helpful saliva. Instead, take full gulps., Smoking can dry out your mouth and discolor your tongue while reducing the amount of helpful saliva you produce. This can cause bacteria to become more aggressive and can cause oral issues, including bad breath, which is hard to deal with. Quitting smoking can jumpstart your saliva production again. It can also reduce bad breath and stop the discoloration of your tongue., Gum encourages the production of saliva in your mouth, which can reduce acid. That said, gum that contains sugar can encourage bacterial growth in your mouth, leading to cavities and tooth decay. Sugarless gum that contains xylitol is recommended to help moisturize your tongue.Sucking on sugarless hard candies can have a similar effect., Diuretics can cause your mouth to dry out because they dehydrate your body.

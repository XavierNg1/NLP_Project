 In unfortunate areas where marrowfat peas are hard to find, you can make do with fresh or frozen peas instead. Just avoid "petite" peas, which won't keep their texture in the mash. The popular English peas or garden peas are a fine choice, though they won't have the same taste as the traditional mush.Frozen peas often have more flavor than supermarket "fresh" peas.The older English peas get, the less sweet and more starchy they become — although this isn't necessarily a bad thing for mushy peas., Rinse the peas in a colander. Discard any brown or wrinkled peas.
 Put the peas in a steamer basket above ½ inch (1.25cm) of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the peas are soft and their skins are well wrinkled. This takes about ten minutes for fresh peas.Frozen peas will cook faster, perhaps in as little as five minutes.If you don't have a steamer basket, boil fresh peas for five minutes or frozen peas for three.You'll lose some flavor with this method.
 While not traditional, these American additions make for a much richer side dish. Melt 1 tbsp. (14g) of butter, then combine with the peas along with 1 tbsp. (15 mL) heavy cream, plus salt and pepper to taste.For a lighter and somewhat more traditional flavor, skip the cream and add a squeeze of lemon juice and a sprig of finely chopped mint.If you want to go haute cuisine, you could also add browned scallions, bacon, or any ingredients you might add to split pea soup.
 Using a potato masher, fork, or immersion blender, break up the peas until they form a mash. Don't go too far: you should still see pea skins and partially intact peas.
 Serve the mushy peas as an accompaniment to fish and chips or another British-inspired meal. Leftovers can be stored in the fridge and reheated for several days.

 Wear it with headphones or a party hat, if you have either, and get a flower bracelet. Buy a princess necklace or non member necklace in a cute colour. If you don't have an instrument and proper headgear, use an animal hat or beret and have a designer skirt if you wish.

If you are a non member, wear something like the clarinet on your back with a head flower.


Boys: Use a boy-colour instrument and some headphones. If you are missing these, take them out. Throw on the rock-est things you have.;

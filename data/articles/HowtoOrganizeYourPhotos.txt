 You didn't accumulate these photos overnight, and you're not going to sort them overnight, either. One approach would be to set a timer for 15 or 30 minutes, and just work for that long.;
, Spread them out over a table or use shoe boxes or trays. If you can leave the project on display for awhile or store them in order between sessions, you'll have less preparation time in each sitting.
 This could be an album, scrapbook, frames, flip-frames, or simply a decorative box.



Cull any hopelessly blurry shots, along with anything that's much too bright or dark. Also throw out anything featuring the photographer's thumb or camera strap if it cannot be salvaged by cropping. Consider discarding duplicates or near-duplicates, too. If you have good double shots, pass them along to Grandma, or anybody else who would appreciate them.
Sift out anything that could be improved by cropping or other adjustment and place it in a separate pile or tray.
Sort them into broad categories. For example, put family photographs in one pile, nature or artistic shots in another, and utility photos (such as pictures taken of your home or belongings for insurance purposes).
 You could arrange them chronologically, by subject, or by event, for instance. Begin sorting them in whatever detail you choose.
 If you're writing directly on the photo, rather than alongside them in an album or scrapbook, make sure you use an appropriate pen.
 If they're going in albums or scrapbooks, you'll also need to arrange them on the pages. You can do a rough layout before committing to a permanent arrangement.

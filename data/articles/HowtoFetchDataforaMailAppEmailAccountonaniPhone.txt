If you select Push, new messages will be sent to your iPhone as soon as they are received.
If you select Fetch, messages will be received based on your device's Fetch interval settings.
If you select Manual, new messages will only be retrieved when the Mail app is open.
 You'll find this in the upper-left corner of the screen. This will return you to the Fetch New Data menu.
 If you set your mail account to Fetch, this is the interval that the mail app will check for new messages.


Setting the Fetch interval to Manual will require you to open the Mail app to retrieve new messages.

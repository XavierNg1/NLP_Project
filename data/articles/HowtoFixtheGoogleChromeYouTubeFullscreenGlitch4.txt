 Chrome contains a “hardware acceleration” feature that helps boost performance. Unfortunately, the feature can also cause issues with tabs and scrolling.Many Chrome users experiencing issues with full screen mode in YouTube report that disabling hardware acceleration solved the issue.,, You may need to scroll down to see it, as it’s at the bottom of the page.
 It’s just beneath “Accessibility.”

,, Now you’ll need to test whether or not disabling hardware acceleration worked for you.
 This will put the video into full screen mode.


If hardware acceleration was your issue, the video will now appear fullscreen (no parts of Chrome should be visible).
If you still see Chrome or your desktop when you’re supposed to be viewing a full screen video, the issue was not the result of hardware acceleration. Return to the Settings screen to turn on hardware acceleration, then try another method.

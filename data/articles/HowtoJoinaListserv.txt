 Since most Listserv applications are designed for internal use within the group, it can only accept email address that comes from a certain server (like the internal email addresses given by your company).


Create an email account or ask your firm’s IT personnel to give you one.
Some public Listserv are programmed to accept almost any email account, as long as it’s working. If your existing email addresses can be included in the Listserv you want to join, you don’t need to create a new one.;
, Once you have your email account, talk to the administrators or IT personnel of your firm and ask them to include your address in the Listserv. They’ll simply add your email address to the server’s mailing list.
 Email messages may be sent any time of the day, depending on the policies of the firm. Listserv are generally used for broadcasting messages like announcements or news throughout the group.
 Once you receive a Listserv message, the first thing you’d most likely want to do is to reply to it. It’s a great way to introduce yourself or simply interact with other members of the Listserv mailing list.


Just use the Reply feature of whatever mailing application or webmail you’re using to respond back to the Listserv message.

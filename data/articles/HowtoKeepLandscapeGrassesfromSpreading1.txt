Cut the bottom out of a large plastic pot. Use heavy shears or a stout knife to cut the bottom out. The pot should be 12” (30.5 cm) or more across and at least 8” (20.3 cm) deep.
Bury the pot where you want the grass.
Center the grass in the pot. Use soil from the hole you dug to sink the pot to fill the pot.
Use a cement drain tile, metal culvert section or plastic drain tile without perforations buried in the ground to confine the grass roots if you don’t have a large plastic pot.
Set pots or other items confining roots into the soil so that you leave about 1” (2.5 cm) of the rim above ground.
Every few years you will need to lift the container and divide the grass plant to keep it from becoming root bound or breaking the container.;
, It will have the spreading confined to a certain area.



At the edge of the area where you wish to confine the grass dig a trench 6” (15.2 cm) across and 8” (20.3cm) deep. This air gap generally prevents rhizomes and stolons from crossing.
Mow the edge of moat frequently in case the grasses manage to cross it.

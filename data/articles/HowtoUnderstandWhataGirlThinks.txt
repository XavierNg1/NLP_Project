 She may or may not show you due to shyness or fear of being critiqued. If she's good at math, ask her how she gets it so well. Don't be too obvious if you don't know whether she likes you or not. It could result in sounding clich√©d.;
, If a girl likes you and doesn't know if you like her back, she is unlikely to do anything about it. It will give them more confidence, and they will be more open.
 She's probably intimidated too, so just break the ice and start to have a fun conversation as a kick off. However, cockiness and extreme boldness are unsavory.
 if you do not dress likely, you cannot begin to know what a girl thinks, apparently. Take a look at your style, you shouldn't change your style for anyone else. Just remember that clothes make the person, and girls love guys with their own styles.
 If one girl doesn't think the way you thought she did, then move on! There are more fish in the sea!

,, Most girls love to find a guy who is sensitive enough to do those small little things. (Pull out her chair, let her go in front of you in lines, offer her your chair if there are none left. Try not to call her ma'am, though. Ma'am is for older women). That's common sense. This also means avoiding making comments that would be sexist, or doing/saying something that treats women as objects.
 Most important, respect the girl's parents as if they were you own, and even better! They make the final decision. If you both like something that the parents respect, good. If you both have a rebellious trait in common, that creates a bad image for parents. Just don't mention it. Be a charmer, irresistible. You worked for the girl, her parents should be easy.
 Girls love attention.

 Trim all sides of the cake even to give the cake sharp straight sides.;
,  No crumb coat just lay it on thick

,  Recheck your level and be sure it is perfectly flat and level.  Make adjustments by adding or removing icing where needed.
  Use a new clean spray bottle to lightly mist your cake with water.
,  Your fondant should go past your cake board.  The larger the piece of fondant, the easier it is to smooth.  Fondant that barely covers the edges of the cake will most likely wrinkle and be hard to smooth.
  This is important not to trim it shorter because it will cause wrinkles when smoothing.  Also, if it is left long then when you are smoothing the hanging weight will cause the fondant to pull away from edges of the cake.
  Always start smoothing from each corner and work toward the center line of the side.  Once at center line the start at the top and work your way from top to bottom.  You can lift the fondant at the cake board to help release air and stretch a bit to pull out wrinkles.
  Trim bottom excess fondant with a sharp knife, pizza cutter or a craft knife.

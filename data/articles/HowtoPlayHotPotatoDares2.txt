, Start playing like you normally would, saying the chant that goes with it. In case you don't know it, here it is: Hot potato, pass it on, pass it on, pass it on, hot potato, pass it on before you burn yourself!


With more than two players, throw the ball across the circle, at random. For younger kids, throw the ball around the circle to make sure they know when they'll receive the ball.
 Whoever has the ball at the end of the chant has to do a dare. Whoever gave the loser the ball is the one in charge of assigning it.
 When the loser carries out the dare, keep playing!

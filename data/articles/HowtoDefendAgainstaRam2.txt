 If a ram decides to charge, it can get to you pretty quickly, so it is highly advised to never turn your back on a nearby ram. Knowing where the ram is at all times is the most effective safety measure.This takes vigilance, but it is the kind of proactive measure that is most likely to pay off. If you can see the ram always, then you have a better chance at defending yourself in case of a charge.
To the end of always having eyes on the ram, it is advisable to work with at least one other person, which can help you get done what you need to while still keeping the ram in sight.
 The ram’s head is its main weapon, so touching its head can be taken by the ram as a sign of aggression. This is why it’s especially important never to pet a ram on the head. Even if it seems friendly, this act can change the ram’s demeanor quickly.Rams that were raised as pets may get close and nuzzle in a way that encourages you to pet them, but you have to avoid it no matter what.
Pushing a ram’s head, even more than scratching or petting, will be taken as an act of aggression against it and can lead a ram to become aggressive.
 When a ram is about to charge, it lowers its head. So if a ram sees you lower your head toward it, this will be taken as a sign that you are an opponent. If you lower your head, you are challenging the ram and you may cause it to charge you.This is especially important to keep in mind if you happen to drop something and need to bend over to pick it up. You should squat and keep your head upright as much as possible so the ram doesn’t see you lower your head.

 If you normally part your hair on the side, go a little deeper than you normally would. To keep it in place while you work on your hair, you can use a clip on the side with more hair, away from the roots., A deep hair part should line up with the highest point of your eyebrow. Doing so will make the look seem more sophisticated and clean. Just use a comb to help you see where the part should go, starting from the highest point of your eyebrow arch.You can take the part a little further down for an edgier look.
 No one is perfectly symmetrical. Therefore, make sure to try the part out on each side of your head. You may find that one side looks better than the other, or you may find that both look equally good. Either way, you have that information for the future., To get a straight line in your part, use a comb to make the part. Take the corner of the comb and drag it up through your hair in a straight line, then split your hair to either side based on where you drew the line. You may need to go over it again.
 While a straight-line part can look lovely, you can also take a messier approach. After you've dried and styled in your hair, simply flip up your hair from the side you choose. This technique creates a rounded crown of hair on top of your head, as well as the messier part.
 If your face is round, letting the hair come partway across your face. In other words, with a down-do, don't just sweep your hair back or behind your ear. Let it frame your face. Doing so gives your face more definition.

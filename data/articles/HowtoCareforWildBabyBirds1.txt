 If you find a baby bird all alone in its nest, don't assume its mother abandoned it. It's more likely she's off getting food for her baby and will return soon.


No matter how much it's chirping and crying, never remove a baby from its nest. Think of it as kidnapping.;
, A nestling is a young bird that hasn't grown feathers yet. They sometimes fall out of their nests, which puts them into danger. The best thing you can do for a nestling is to NOT take it home, but try to return it to its nest.


Search nearby trees and bushes for an empty nest. If you can find one, place the bird back into its nest so it can wait for its mother to return.
Remember to be gentle when handling it!

, Birds can be quite good at hiding their nests in nature. If you can't find the nest, you should still try to reunite the baby with its mother by making a manmade nest for it to wait in.


Fill a small box or bowl with dried grass or paper towels, and place the bird in its makeshift nest. Do not use fresh grass, because that could make the baby bird cold
You can also use a basket with a handle, then hang the basket from a nearby tree branch.
Leave this "nest" where you found the bird. Wait to see if a parent bird comes by to take care of the baby., Licensed wildlife rehabilitation specialists will be best equipped to keep the baby bird healthy and happy.


If you canâ€™t find a rehabilitator on your own, call vets, bird stores or the local Audubon Society and ask them to put you in touch with one.
The wildlife rehabilitator will want to know where you found the bird, so he or she can return it to its home when it's healed. Be as specific as possible.

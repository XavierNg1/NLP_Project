 While it's tempting to buy a popular ringtone or a trendy wallpaper, that's just an extra expense that doesn't make your phone work any better. Some phone companies offer ringback tones, as well, which are not necessary components in making your phone work for you. Analyze the age of your phone and determine if insurance is really worth the price. Often, when a phone gets to be several months old, insurance isn't worth the cost. Also consider whether you really need that three-way calling function or GPS service. If you're trying to reduce costs, these are "extras" that you can probably do without.;
, If your package has a limited number of minutes, try to keep track of how many minutes you've used so that you do not exceed your plan's allowance. Paying for extra minutes is expensive. To reduce your usage, check your voicemail from a landline, call during off-peak hours and place calls during your nights/weekends hours. If you cannot cut down your minutes on a regular basis, look into changing plans to accommodate your usage.
 Text messaging, picture messaging and playing on the Internet eat up data allowances. By reducing the amount of time you spend on each of these tasks, you are likely to reduce your bill.
 If you add people who are apt to exceed your minute allowance or fail to pay their portions of the bill, you will end up having to pay more for your phone.
 Paying late results in additional late fees.
 Sometimes you will get a discount as a result of your employment. Many government employees or employees of large firms or companies receive small discounts on a monthly basis. These help reduce the overall cell phone bill. Additionally, some companies reward loyal customers with discounted rates. Even if your provider won't give you a discount, it doesn't hurt to ask.
 Phone companies make mistakes. By checking your bill, you will find any mistakes or erroneous charges.

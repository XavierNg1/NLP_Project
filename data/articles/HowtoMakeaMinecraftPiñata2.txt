 This time though, you don't have to make a room. Instead, make just a roof to attach the piñatas to., If you will give all the items to the piñata breaker, make just 3 piñata. Lessen the loot inside each piñata.

If the piñatas are for something like Choose and Get, make more piñatas. Five to 8 are enough. Lessen the loot some more in each piñata. Two kinds of loot in each piñata is good.

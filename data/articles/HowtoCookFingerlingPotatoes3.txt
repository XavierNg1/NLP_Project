 After washing your hands, use your thumbs and fingers to clean the potatoes’ skins under running water. Do not use soap. Wash your fingerlings even if you peel them before cooking. This way, your peeler won’t move any dirt or chemicals from the skin to the flesh., Skin 1.5 lbs (680 g) of potatoes if desired. Leave them whole or slice or dice them into smaller bits. To serve them halved, you can either slice them now or wait until you have boiled them whole. Once you are finished prepping, transfer the fingerlings to a pot., Fill the pot with enough water to cover the potatoes. Place the pot on a burner and boil the water. Once the water boils, switch the burner off. Allow the potatoes to sit in the boiled water as it loses heat. This may take ten or more minutes., Line the skillet’s bottom with a tablespoon of cooking oil, or more if needed. Wait until the potatoes and water have cooled off almost all the way, then place the skillet on a burner set to high. Drain the cooled-off potatoes and water into a colander over the sink. Then empty the potatoes from the colander into the skillet once it is hot., Stir your potatoes around so all of them touch the skillet without sitting on top of one another. Then leave them alone for a couple of minutes. Choose one piece to remove in order to check its bottom. If it has browned, stir the whole batch up so other sides can touch the skillet. If it hasn’t, put it back and check again in a minute or two., Continue to stir your potatoes up every couple of minutes so the potatoes brown as evenly as possible on all sides. Sprinkle your seasonings over them as you near the end. Stir them up to distribute them evenly over your fingerlings. Turn off the heat and serve.

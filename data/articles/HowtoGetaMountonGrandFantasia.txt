 You can sign up for an account on the Aeria games website, and you can use your account for any of their games.;
, You'll need to login in the live game; if you login at the site it won't work. Make sure the game isn't on any maintenance.
 Do quests or defeat monsters to raise your experience and level up.
, An icon will help you identify mount shops. Travel to the mount shops and examine the mounts.
 The merchants will be asking for about 15 Gold- NOT bronze or silver.
 Permanent mounts are for level 30's and 40's. Pick the mount you can afford and is appealing to you.
 An example of this is in Ancient Forest, where Tes will offer you a quest and reward you 5 consumable wolf totems that can temporarily summon a wolf. Once an item is consumed, you will be able to ride the mount until you do any action that requires you to leave your mount. (Example: Fighting)

,, Each time you summon the mount, an item is consumed from your backpack. Be sure you are aware of this before using your mount summoner.

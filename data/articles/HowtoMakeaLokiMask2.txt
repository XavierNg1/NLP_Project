 Again, use a reference picture to guide you. The nosepieces should roughly resemble elongated hourglasses, with the nose-end lobe longer than the forehead lobe.


You're cutting three pieces so that you can layer them over your nose. If you have a particularly long nose, you may want to cut four or five.
 This will give your nose "breathing room" when you don the mask.


Although you can cut square holes to fit your nose, you may want to cut the nose holes to the end of the nose lobe to expose your nostrils if you plan to wear the mask for extended periods.
 This is where you'll put the "L" that identifies the mask as the Mask of Loki.
 You may want to temporarily tape each nosepiece in place as your adjust their positions and refine your nose holes, then glue them in place when you're satisfied with their arrangement.
 You can create the four nose rivets in one of several ways:


Cut out cardboard circles.
Use the plastic or metal heads off thumbtacks. (Do not use the entire tack.)
Use actual light rivet heads.
 Use the reference picture as your guide to place them correctly.
 The "L" should be slightly italicized, without serifs, and of a size appropriate to fit within the circle. Again, consult the reference picture.

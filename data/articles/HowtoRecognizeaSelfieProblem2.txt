 You should look at your social media habits and consider if you post a lot of selfies on social media every day. Though taking selfies on your phone may be enough for you, you may feel compelled to share it on social media with others. Too many selfie posts can be a sign that you are addicted to taking them and sharing them for others to see.


You may scroll through your social media pages to see if many of your posts or the majority of your posts are selfies. This could be a sign that you are a little too into posting selfies and sharing them with others.
 You should also be mindful of how often you click open your social media and check your selfie posts. Are you constantly looking at Facebook or Instagram to see if your selfie post got enough likes? Are you upset when your selfies do not get as many likes or comments as you hoped? These could be signs that you have an unhealthy relationship with selfies and social media.You may start a tally of how often you check your selfie posts during one day. If you check your selfie posts more than one to two times a day or feel you are checking them compulsively, you may have a selfie problem.
 You should also consider how your selfie habit affects you commitments and daily routine. Notice if you are coming up short on your commitments because you are too busy trying to get the perfect selfie. You should also recognize if your selfie habit is distracting you from getting things done in your daily routine or taking up time in your day that should be spent on other commitments or tasks.For example, perhaps you notice that you spend 30 minutes trying to get the perfect selfie in the morning before school to post on social media. You may realize that by the time you get the perfect selfie, you have missed your bus or end up late for your first class. This could be a sign that your selfie habit is taking up too much of your time.

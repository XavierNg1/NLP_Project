 Figure out what you would like to be paid for writing. You may have different rates for different outlets; for example, you might charge less to write an article for a nonprofit organization’s blog than you would for a larger business. You can be flexible on your rates, but you should establish a standard.It’s important to have rates so that you have a fee to quote if you are hired for a writing job. There are many websites and other publications that need writing, but they often don’t know what to charge. Give them a starting point and negotiate depending on length, difficulty and time involvement.
It’s also important to not charge too little. If you are constantly undercutting your rates, you may find it difficult to raise them and earn what you really deserve.
 If you are trying to get writing jobs that pay by the piece, you may get many small payments. It can be easier for many employers or outlets to pay you through a simple payment service like PayPal.You can usually register for free on an online payment service like PayPal, but they may take a small percentage of your pay.
 If you’re making money, you’ll likely have to claim it on your taxes.Make sure you keep meticulous records of your income, including job, date, and amount.


If you are collecting royalties from a book, remember that this is also taxable income.
 Show your clients that you are an active writer who is currently working. Even if you’re not getting paid, you should still have relevant, current examples of your writing available on your website. Every six months or so, comb through your writing to find the best of your recent work. Add one or two of these to your portfolio.

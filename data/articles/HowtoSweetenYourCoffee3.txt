 If new or exotic flavors are what you're looking for, then you can purchased flavored syrups. If you frequent coffee shops, you've likely seen arrangements of syrup bottles made by Torino, Da Vinci Gourmet, or Monin. These syrups can be purchased online and used to flavor and sweeten coffee, tea, desserts, and other items.
 Of course, the classic calorie-free coffee sweeteners are the ubiquitous pink, blue, and yellow packets. Saccharin, aspartame, and Sucralose, marketed as Sweet'N Low, Equal, and Splenda respectively, dissolve quickly and are available in easily portable packets that make them ideal for travel.

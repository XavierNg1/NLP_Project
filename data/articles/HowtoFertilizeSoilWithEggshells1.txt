 When you use eggs in a meal or for a recipe, save the shells. Crack open your raw eggs, rinse the shells with warm water, and let them dry in a sunny pot. Run your finger around the inside of the shell when washing it to remove any residue, but try to preserve the membrane. Most of the nutrients are in this.


For best results, plan on using 4 to 5 eggs for each plant you want to fertilize.;
, You can crush them into flakes using your hands or a food processor. You can also grind them into a powder using a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder instead.It is possible to use whole eggshells in your soil, but they will decompose much faster if they are crushed or ground into powder.To make the crushing process easier, bake the eggshells at 350 degrees until the start to lightly brown before grinding.
 Putting eggshells directly into the hole with the plant ensures that the plant will get the nutrients from the decomposing eggshells., As they decompose, they will leach calcium and other nutrients into the soil. This will help your plants grow into strong, healthy plants.
 When you buy plants from the nursery, you will need to transplant them outside, or into a new pot. Before you do this, consider mixing a handful of crushed eggshells into the soil. Overtime, the eggshells will leach their nutrients into the soil, and help the young plants grow into healthy, strong plants.


If you aren't able to use eggshells right away, you can also crush them and add them to your compost bin.

 Call the editor and pitch your idea or story and inquire whether they would be interested in your subject..


An example of a phone call: “Hello Mr. Jones. How are you? My name is Jane Doe and I’m calling you to let you know I am currently considering doing a story about the consequences of fracking on small towns. If I can gather up enough citizens of Smallville, USA to interview, would you be interested in this article for your magazine?”
It would be helpful to have general commitments already from those you wish to interview for your story. This can help you sound more reliable, prepared, and ready to write your story to the editor.
 If you receive a positive response from the editor, thank them for their time and inform them of when you will be sending them the pitch via email.For example you could end your call with: “Great. I will send you an official pitch within the week. Just to verify, your email is sam.jones@everythingmagazine.com? Ok, awesome. Thank you for your time and I look forward to working with you.”

, Once you have been given the go-ahead to send your pitch, follow the guidelines and instructions the magazine has for submitting pitches.If for any reason you feel or know you will be delayed in emailing the prompt in, send an email to the editor explaining your delay and try to give them an estimate on when they can expect the pitch.
Most magazines have their guidelines online. Make sure you have reviewed them so you have the best chance at getting your pitch reviewed.It would be helpful to get a few copies of your target magazine to read in an effort to get a feel for the type of style they are looking for as well as average length for the articles they publish.

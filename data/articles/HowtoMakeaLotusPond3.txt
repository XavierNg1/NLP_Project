 Lotus need fairly shallow water so if you have a deeper fish pond you will either need to have a shallow end for lotus or plant them in a container that is raised on blocks under the water.
 Larger fish will eat lotus – Koi carp in particular. Therefore, you need to make sure that the planting bed is weighed down with sand and lava rocks or gravel to prevent them accessing the lotus tubers.
 Fish need clean, fresh, oxygenated water, food (usually on the surface), hiding places and enough space to move and grow.


Unfortunately, lotus will easily choke a pond, therefore the pond will probably require a filter or fountain to keep the water fresh if you have fish – ask for advice at your local aquatics supplies store.
Lotus will prefer to be away from any fast moving water caused by a fountain or filter, so keep them in a separate part of the pond.
 Fish need enough space for their size – don’t believe the old wives’ tale that fish only grow to fit the available space. It isn’t true!


The fish won’t appreciate living in a small space with a fountain pounding overhead and lotus choking up all the space.
You’ll need to confine your lotus to one area of the pond and let the fish have the rest of the space.

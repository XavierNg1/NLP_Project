 Three commonplace items are all you will need to make this flag:


Square piece of fabric
Rubber bouncing ball about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter
Rubber band;
, Many materials around the house are perfect for making a penalty flag in a pinch. Think about using dish rags, larger fabric samples, and swaths. A cloth napkin is a sure-fire winner, and though any size will work, for the most authentic flag, use either the luncheon or dinner sizes at 13 inches (33.0 cm) by 13 inches (33.0 cm) and 18 inches (45.7 cm) by 18 inches (45.7 cm) respectively.
 This ensures that you will have the same amount of cloth on all sides of your flag. Not only will your flag look better, it will also be more aerodynamic. Remember an even placement of weight will allow your flag to be thrown farther and much more accurately.
 Bring them together and twist the fabric tightly around the bouncing ball. When the ball seems tightly wrapped and secure, pinch the twisted area of fabric shut.
 In order to form a sturdier bundle, you may need to wrap the rubber band around the twisted area of fabric several times. This will secure the ball inside of the fabric and keep the flag in one piece.

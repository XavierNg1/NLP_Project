 Take your peeled and halved garlic and rub it on the inside of your saucepan. Discard the garlic afterwards. Insert the butter into the pan and heat it over a low heat. Roll the melted butter in the pan to evenly distribute it., Sprinkle your flour into the butter a little at time, stirring it in with a whisk as you do so. Continue to stir these ingredients while cooking them like this for about 2 minutes. Then stir in your beer., At this point, you should increase the heat to your saucepan to medium-high. Heat the mixture until it boils, then reduce the heat so it stays at a steady boil. Stir it constantly throughout this process, and allow the mixture to boil for roughly 2 to 3 minutes.When the mixture is thick and smooth, it’s done. Depending on your stove top, it may take more or less time for the mixture to reach this consistency., Reduce the saucepan’s heat to low. Add your cheese to the mixture in ½ cup (118 ml) increments. While doing so, stir it with a wooden spoon or a similar kitchen utensil until the cheese is fully melted and the mixture is smooth.


Add cheese in this way until no more cheese remains. Continue stirring throughout the process with a utensil., Pour your beer cheese from the saucepan into a serving container, a crockpot, or a fondue pot. If you use a serving container, eat your cheese quickly so it doesn’t cool down too much or thicken excessively. Crockpots and fondue pots will keep your beer cheese warm throughout a party or event.You may want to add some garnish to your beer cheese to improve its presentation or modify the recipe. Chopped onions and parsley flakes, for example, are an excellent addition.
Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator. In most cases, this recipe will keep for at least 5 to 7 days.

Some areas have food cooperatives where you can collectively purchase local food with other buyers. This drives prices down since you can buy in large quantities, and it also allows you the convenience of being able to shop for all your food items in a single supermarket-like environment.
Locally-owned ethnic food stores are often easily accessible sources of high-quality, locally-produced food.;

If you find a producer with whom you are satisfied, ask about making arrangements to purchase food on a year-round basis. Many farmers may be able to provide more food than what they have displayed on a particular day at the farmer's market.
Farmers may also be able to provide information on how to best store, cook and prepare the food they sell, especially if you are purchasing something you've never tried before.



Those who exclusively buy locally are not able to have any type of food they desire available year-round. Often they must purchase only seasonal produce, and must stock up on meat during certain times of the year when animals are slaughtered. In order to prolong the amount of time you have to consume your food, invest in a stand-alone freezer and learn how to can and dehydrate produce.

 After the sweater has been washed, put it in the dryer for a few minutes to remove any stiffness. Choose the low heat option to minimize any shrinkage. After 5-10 minutes, remove the sweater from the dryer., Lay the sweater down in the shape that it will be on your body. This means that the body part is flat, and the arms and shoulders are in the form they are when you wear it. Do not hang your sweater, as that could cause it to stretch or get hanger bumps in the shoulders.


If possible, set the towel on a tile floor, rather than on carpet. Otherwise, your carpet will get damp as the sweater soaks through the towel.
 Cotton is heat resistant so it can withstand repeated use of an iron. Check the sweaterâ€™s label to see if there are any special instructions regarding ironing.

 Sometimes, people just aren't good for us. If this person leaves you feeling sad or not good enough, odds are you're in a toxic friendship.


Don't hold grudges against the person. They may be too wrapped up in their world to notice their effect on you.
Make peace with your feelings. Whatever they are, they're legitimate -- you wouldn't be feeling them if they weren't! Forgive yourself, too.
 A toxic friendship isn't worth having. Though you may hope, change is unlikely to come. A better way to spend your time is around people who let you thrive and make you feel comfortable.


Stop putting effort into the relationship. Be kind when near, but don't seek out opportunities to be noticed or appreciated by this person. Put effort into relationships where the other person is willing to meet you halfway.
Concentrate on other friends. You have a support system all around you of friends and family who care about you. You are not dependent on this person.
 You are the most important person in your life. Above all, you need to be happy. And this person isn't cutting it.


If they confront you on your avoidance, be clear. Tell them, "I need to spend more time with other friends; I feel like I'm doing all the work in our friendship." If they want to salvage the relationship, they will try. If they don't, good riddance! You can walk away knowing you did the right thing for you.

 If the rust only showed through the chrome in pinpricks, drying the surface with a towel after cleaning may be enough to keep up the chrome's appearance.
 Apply a wax or polish to the chrome to protect it from any further damage. Use a product only for its intended purpose, such as car wax for chrome-plated vehicles.


Typically, wax is applied, buffed and left to dry, then a second layer is applied over it and buffed again.
 This will keep a nice shine on the chrome, but the level of rust protection depends on the brand of paint and how well it is applied. Select a paint appropriate to the task, typically automotive paint, and apply as evenly as possible over areas pitted by rust damage. Use a fine, 1200 grit sandpaper to smooth it down after it dries, taking care to avoid sanding unpainted areas.
 This is an expensive option, usually only performed on cars that were severely damaged by rust. Hire a mechanic who offers a chrome plating service if you want to re-chrome your car. If you're feeling ambitious, you can try to chrome plate objects at home, especially if they are relatively small.

 Baking soda helps remove odors from a variety of surfaces, including textiles.


Sprinkle baking soda on the rug.






Allow the baking soda to absorb for about 1 hour.






Vacuum the rug using a brushless suction head of a vacuum cleaner.
 The slight acidity of vinegar makes it effective in removing odors and germs.


Mix equal parts water and vinegar in a spray bottle.






Lightly mist the rug with the vinegar and water solution.






Wipe the rug gently with a clean, dry cloth.

 A desiccant is a substance that draws moisture out. Suitable desiccants for herbs include cornmeal, sand, orris root, borax, silica gel and even kitty litter.


Silica gel is popular because it is light and won't crush the herbs; it is easily obtainable from craft stores. However, when working with it, wear a mask to avoid breathing in its fumes.
 Pick when moisture won't affect the herbs or their flowers.
 Glass and plastic won't create moisture.
 Keep any flowers separate from one another (not touching). Leaves and petals that are close together will require pulling apart to ensure the desiccant goes in between gaps and dries out every part of the herb.


If the shape of the petals or leaves is important, check for any that get bent out of shape and realign them as you're rearranging the desiccant.
You can layer desiccant and herbs if wished; just be aware that the more weight on top, the more the plant matter beneath risks being crushed.
 This will only take a few days. Desiccant will leave herb leaves and flowers bone-dry and therefore somewhat brittle. To remove desiccant, use a small brush or a camera cleaning bellows to shift desiccant off the plant matter without damaging the plant. Handle with care.


Avoid over drying the herbs or they may simply fall apart when handled.
 The herbs are not suitable for consumption.

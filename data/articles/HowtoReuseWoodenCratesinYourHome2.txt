 Start by drawing rectangles on either side of the crates with a pencil, near the top of the shortest sides. The handles shouldn’t be much wider than a third of the width of your crate. Use a jigsaw to cut out the handles, following your pencil lines.

If the crates you have already have handles cut into them, you can skip this step., You’ll need to get casters, which are small wheels specifically for furniture and crates. The wheels are attached to a small metal plate with holes, designed to be screwed into another object. You’ll want to use a drill to screw the wheels into the bottom of the crate, one for each corner., Make sure to follow the grain as you sand. You shouldn’t need to sand down finer than #180 grit. This will make sure the crates are smooth enough for you to handle if you need to cart them around., Use a brush attachment with soft bristles. This will ensure you’re not scratching the crate, and the bristles will pick up the wood dust more effectively than other attachments., Your options here are nearly limitless. You can use stencils and spray paint to write on the cart. This can be useful for writing a child’s name or labeling the cart with a word reflecting its contents. Alternatively, you can use paints to decorate the cart.

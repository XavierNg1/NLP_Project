 Do you want to tell a small group of friends and family? Do you want to tell your significant other? Do you want to tell a coworker? Do you want to tell it to just about whomever will listen? You must consider who specifically you want to tell, because, if they are not found together naturally, you might have to call together all the people you want to see to tell them the news.
 Unless it's a person you are scheduled to see anyway (for example, coworker, parole officer, etc.), you may have to set aside a time to see them and tell them the news. This can be something as great as a party or as simple as a cup of coffee.

Clear your throat, to ensure there is no junk in your throat
Make sure you are prepared to speak loudly
Think of the actual words you are going to say (you don't want to stammer, entirely ruining the effect of the happy news)
Quickly check to make sure there is nothing in your teeth
Take a deep breath

, The element of surprise can be completely ruined if your demeanor gives it away. (Hint: oftentimes, a way to really get the best audience response from good news is to actually pretend like you have bad news to share. Then, at the last second, you share that you do in fact have good news, now bringing your audience from sadness to great surprise and happiness)

, Make sure to keep eye contact with your audience. If you don't, they may think you are lying.

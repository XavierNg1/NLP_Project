 What if a bear walked up to your character in the middle of the woods? Would your character keep quiet or participate in a heated debate in politics? You have to know how he or she would act to have an equal reaction., The first couple of minutes of the games is a "tutorial". You have dialogue which will make your character's first impression in the game world. In Skyrim, the decision of going with the Stormcloak or the Imperial during the dragon attack can inform other characters who you side with during the Civil War of Skyrim., It's time for your character to shine! Remember to stick to your character's description, and remember, if it's your first time and you aren't doing too well, that there's always another chance to get back on track and continue to have a fun Role Playing experience!

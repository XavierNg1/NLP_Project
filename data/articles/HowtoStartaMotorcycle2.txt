 For cold starting, there is usually a choke lever or "cut-off switch" on the handlebar. On some bikes, there may be a choke lever mounted on the carburetor. Operating this will provide the necessary rich fuel mixture when the motorcycle is "cold" – when it hasn't been used for more than a few hours. The dirtier the carburetor, or the colder the engine is, the more the choke will need to be engaged.You don't need to use the choke lever when starting a motorcycle "hot." If the motorcycle has been running and the engine is already hot, you won't need as much power to get it going. Just use a small amount of throttle and the engine should fire.Many bikes have a cut-off switch on the kickstand, so make sure that the kickstand is up as well. Having the bike in neutral will disable the kickstand shutoff.
 Make sure that the cut-off switch is "on." You will need to leave the handlebar throttle twist-grip closed while operating the starter motor or kick-start lever. Otherwise, the engine will flood, making starting difficult or impossible. Remember – the choke lever is usually not necessary if the bike has already been running in the past few hours.
 Your dash lights should "light up" when it's in this position. Also if your bike is in neutral as suggested, then you should notice a green light indicating that you are in neutral.
 Squeeze and hold your clutch lever down (located on the left) and push the start button (located on the right). You should hear the blissful sound of your motorcycle cranking up.
 Shortly after the engine fires, close the choke lever progressively and open the throttle slightly as the engine warms. As you ride, you may still need some choke for a short distance – but close the choke lever as soon as possible to achieve smooth running. Do not over-rev the motorcycle when it is warming up.

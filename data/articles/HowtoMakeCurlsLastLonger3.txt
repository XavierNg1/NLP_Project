 Irons require dry hair in order to work effectively and can burn if your hair is wet.


You may also wish to apply a heat-protective spray to your hair before using the iron since it can be dangerous the first few times. These sprays can be found at any beauty store.
 Since heat is what makes the hair curl, it is important that the curling iron is very hot before you start to curl. It should be 200 degrees or above.


Do not use a cheap iron. Invest in a more expensive, reliable iron which will provide consistent heat.
 Go at a consistent pace so that the iron does not have time to burn your hair.


Be sure to avoid letting the iron sit in one place too long.
Do not let the iron touch your skin since it is very hot.
 Leave the pin in for around 10-15 minutes.


This will help hold the curl in and should increase the time the curls stay in your hair.
 Apply a liberal amount, maybe around 10-15 sprays.


Hairspray is key to holding hair in place and will help curls stay for a long time.
Let the hairspray sit in your hair for around 10-15 minutes.
 Your hair should now be in curls that will last for a long time.


You can also then braid this hair before bed if you want to try an alternative method.

 If you live in an area that has definite seasons, use the seasons to your advantage to tailor your money-making schemes.


In summer, you can mow lawns and sell lemonade.
In autumn, you can rake leaves.
In winter, you can shovel snow or hang lights.
In spring, you can help plant gardens and ready the garden for planting.
 In addition to the seasons, take advantage of holidays!

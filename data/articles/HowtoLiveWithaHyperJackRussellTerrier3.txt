 Jack Russells specifically are happiest and most fulfilled when they have a job that they’re responsible for. Try to give your dog a job that fits the strengths of the breed. For instance, Jack Russells love to dig and hunt. If you give your dog the task of taking care of rodents in the yard and reward your dog when it does well with this job, then it probably won’t have as much hyper energy to exert.If you don’t have a yard for your Jack Russell to dig in, you can give it a cleaning job by commanding it to put away toys or give it a notification job by commanding it to bark when the mail truck or school bus drive by your home. Reward these actions with treats., Your Jack Russell may react to or reflect the energy that you put off. Do your best to have a calm and assertive presence. If you’re stressed about your job or frustrated about an argument you had, your dog will pick up on and be impacted by that nervous energy., Dogs sense the world first and foremost with their noses, so aromatherapy might have a powerful influence over your Jack Russell. Just like it has a calming effect on humans, lavender can relax dogs as well. Ask your veterinarian about other scents that may be specifically effective for calming your Jack Russell as well as safe application and dispersal methods.Sometimes essential oils are safe to apply directly to your dog’s skin, but you may want to consider purchasing a dog aromatherapy pre-mixed spray that’s already properly diluted and safe to spray throughout your home.

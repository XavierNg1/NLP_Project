 If you are looking to explain your introverted nature to the extroverts in your life, don’t forget to share the non-negotiables. It’s tough being an introvert when those around you label or stigmatize you. Ask your loved ones to avoid using common labels like “anti-social” or “shy,” because these don’t effectively describe most introverts., An extrovert’s ultimate mission is to “rub off” on you. Discourage your friends and family from taking on such a challenge. While it can be nice for you to get out of your comfort zone every now and then, they can’t change who you naturally are.Explain to your extrovert friends that they are welcome to make recommendations for social situations. But, they should be cool if you choose to decline. Overall, send the message that they should not be trying to “fix” your introverted ways.
 Introverts aren’t interested in competing with outgoing personalities while communicating. If a brash extrovert interrupts you, you are unlikely to put up much of a fight to dominate the conversation. Such a tendency may lead to extroverts missing out on important insights that you may have to share.Ask your extroverts to avoid interrupting and actively listen to what you have to say. Also, they should ask insightful questions to keep the conversation going.
 Introverts are generally slow to warm up to people and take their time opening up. If the extrovert complains of your private nature, let them know that it’s nothing against them. Introverts are valuable friends, partners, and coworkers, but extroverts may not realize this if they judge you too quickly.

 You should also wash them if they are very dirty.
 Pour a mixture of one part bleach to one part water. Immerse the jeans in the bucket of bleach water until they are tan or white, or up to one hour.


Rinse the jeans very well. You can dye them immediately after bleaching.
 Find a place to put it. You may want to set it out on a lawn if you are afraid of getting dye on bathroom or kitchen surfaces.
 Boiling the water is the best way to ensure a good dye job; however, you can also use very hot tap water. Pour the water into your bucket.
 You will need one-half bottle of dye for every pound of fabric. For richer colors, use a full bottle.


You can buy Rit dyes in a number of colors at supermarkets, box stores and craft stores.
 Stir well.
 Pour the mixture into the dye bath. Stir well to combine.
 Mix it into the dye bath.
 Wring them out. Insert the jeans into the dye bath.
 Then, stir them once every 10 minutes for up to one hour. The longer you leave the jeans in the dye, the darker the color will be.
 Wring the jeans out and then take them into wash inside. Use a tray or bucket to ensure dye doesnâ€™t drip on your flooring.
 Air-dry the jeans. Wash the jeans separately for two to three more washes.

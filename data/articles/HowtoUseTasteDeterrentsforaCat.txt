 Cats have fewer taste buds than dogs and aren’t affected by many flavors that are used for dog deterrents. Pick one that is advertised as a product for both cats and dogs. Bitter apple deters cats, whereas spicy flavors do not., Opt for a natural repellent rather than a chemical one. Prolonged exposure to certain commercial chemicals can make your cat sick or cause hair loss., Some deterrents may stain carpets or upholstery. Perform a spot test by applying a small amount of the deterrent on a hidden area of your item. Let it dry to see if the item is colorfast. If there is no change, you can apply the deterrent safely., Cats are less inclined to eat things around the house than dogs, but there are some things to worry about. Particularly, cats like to eat plants, many of which can be hazardous to their health.

Examples of common plants that cats should not eat include cacti, Christmas trees, daffodil, mistletoe, tomato leaves, Hydrangea, ivy, lilies, and Chrysanthemum.
Even if it won’t hurt your cat to eat a plant, it will probably hurt the plant. It is always a good idea to spray deterrents on house plants, unless they are designed for your cat to eat, like cat grass.Electrical cords and furniture are chewing hazards for cats. Try spraying them with the deterrent as well.
 After you have introduced your cat to the deterrent, spray it on plants or other items that it likes to chew. Consider using your hands to rub it into and around the plant. After your cat is familiar with the deterrent, the smell alone should repel it, but it doesn’t hurt to be thorough., Continue spraying the item daily to ensure that the deterrent doesn’t fade. Do this for at least two weeks. After two weeks, it is likely that your cat will have lost interest in the item. If not, continue treatment until your cat no longer shows interest in it.

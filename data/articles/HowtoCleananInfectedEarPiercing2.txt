 Start by cleaning the infection twice a day at home. You should see signs of improvement, like reduced redness or swelling, after two days. If the infection worsens or shows no signs of improvement, schedule an appointment with your doctor or visit a healthcare clinic., Monitor the infection closely during the first day. See a doctor if the infection starts spreading beyond the piercing site or if you develop a fever. These could indicate a more serious infection that will require antibiotic treatment., Be extra cautious about dealing with an infected cartilage piercing, or a piercing at the top part of the ear. It’s better to be on the safe side and have a doctor look at infected cartilage sooner rather than later. Infected cartilage piercings are more likely to escalate, and they can lead to long-term deformities, such as "cauliflower ear," which causes the cartilage to take on a bumpy appearance., When you visit your doctor, they’ll likely take a culture of the infection site. This will help them identify the type of bacteria that has caused the infection.Ask the doctor, “Do you recommend any antibiotics for this infection? What type of antibiotic is most effective for this type of bacterial infection?”
Do not wash or clean the piercing for at least 24 hours before seeing a doctor. The doctor will want to take a swab of the infected ear to diagnose it, and cleaning products can interfere with this test.
 Redness, swelling, itchiness, and other signs of infection can also be due to an allergy. If cultures come back negative, talk to your doctor about getting an allergy test.If you’ve never had a piercing before, you might find that you have a metal allergy. You can avoid allergic reactions to piercings by getting an earring that is nickel-free, as nickel is the most common metallic allergen.
Your doctor may refer you to an allergist for more specialized testing to identify what the allergy might be.

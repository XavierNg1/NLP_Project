 Woodpeckers are easily scared off by the sight of predators, shiny materials, and anything out of the ordinary, especially if it moves. Try affixing the following visual deterrents to your house in the area where woodpeckers have caused damage:


Hang aluminum pie plates, foil strips or reflective tape on your home. The pieces of aluminum should be long enough to dangle and move in the wind, which scares woodpeckers away. Aluminum flashing, a material sold at hardware stores, can also be nailed to your house to protect it from woodpeckers.
Hang pieces of string or colorful rope in the areas where woodpeckers like to hang out.
Place a hawk, owl or eagle figurine on your rafters close to where you've seen woodpeckers.
Hang a flag or decoration near the area for a more visually appealing solution. A windsock or windmill that moves quickly when the wind blows works well to scare woodpeckers away.
 Woodpeckers are scared by the sound of their predators and other unfamiliar noises. Install one of the following sound deterrents hear the area where woodpeckers drum on your home:

Purchase an ultrasonic recording of a woodpecker in distress, along with predator sounds, and put it in your attic window or somewhere close to the top of your house. Program the device to go off periodically day and night to keep woodpeckers away. More expensive sound systems can be programmed to make the predator sounds when a woodpecker comes close.
Place several wind chimes on and around your house. The noise from these chimes may discourage woodpecker visitors.

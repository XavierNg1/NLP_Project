 You can shift the topic of conversation instead of changing it abruptly, by branching out in small steps from the subject that you are currently talking about.


Use ‘word association’ to shift from one topic to another. For example, if you have dragged on the subject of skiing or snowboarding too long, go on to talk about the weather up north, which can eventually branch to talking about the weather down south.
 You can build a bridge from one topic to another by agreeing with the speaker, and then using the word ‘but’ to change to a new topic.


For example, if you don’t want to hear any more about cars, you can say, “I love fast cars! But I’m actually really into running fast.” Other transition words/phrases include: “That reminds me of…” and “By the way…”

, Let your conversation partner help you change the topic of conversation. Listen carefully what they are saying and ask questions that steer the conversation in a different direction.


Make your questions open ended. This means they cannot be answered by a yes or no. Begin your question with the Who, What, Where, When, Why, or How to get a more detailed answer. , Maybe the conversation has just gone off on a tangent. Reintroduce an earlier topic by saying something like “I was really interested in what we were talking about earlier - can you tell me more?”

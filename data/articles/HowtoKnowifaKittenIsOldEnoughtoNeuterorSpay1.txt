 There is some debate about when cats should be fixed. Some experts suggest getting a kitten spayed or neutered when the cat is as young as two months old. Others, arguing that cats need more time to develop before removing their sex organs, say that spaying and neutering should occur closer to when the cat is four months old.In general, in an effort to limit pet populations, early spaying and neutering is encouraged. Many veterinarians agree that it is better to spay or neuter your kitten a bit early rather than risking it starting its reproductive cycle and getting impregnated accidentally.;
, Instead, doing it before her first cycle can actually help her health in the future.


Having your kitten fixed before her first estrus minimizes the risk of some health conditions that could pop up in the future, for instance mammary tumors.
 Your veterinarian will have the best idea about when your kitten is ready to be spayed or neutered. Have a discussion with the vet about when the surgery should occur and why the vet believes your kitten is ready.Feel free to ask the veterinarian any questions that you have about the surgery. You should get enough information so that you are secure in your decision to get your cat spayed or neutered.

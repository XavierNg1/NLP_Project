 A small beard comb works wonders when it comes to identifying and removing stray whiskers . . . and food crumbs. The Van Dyke is a refined look; inattention will show!

, The shape of your chin beard has a huge effect on your overall appearance, so keep the lines clean as time passes. While new beard growth is inevitable, daily attention to your face, and precision upkeep of your mustache, soul patch and chin beard area with a pair of sharp scissors and a beard trimmer will help you extend the mileage on your Van Dyke.
 Beard and mustache wax - especially when applied with a twist of your fingers - can turn your Van Dyke into a show stopper at a party or special event. Be sure to wear clothes as stylish as your beard.

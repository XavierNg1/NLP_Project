 Freeze 2 to 3 hours or until firmly solid.


Make sure the apple slices are in a single layer and are not touching one another. The benefit of this method is the apple slices are frozen individually, making it easy to use as much or as little at a time as needed. If the apples overlap or touch during this initial freezing, however, they will be stuck together until you thaw them, thereby removing this benefit.
 After the slices are frozen solid, remove them from the cookie sheet using a flat spatula and transfer them to a freezer-safe plastic container.


Alternatively, you could also use freezer-safe resealable plastic bags. Just make sure to press out as much air from the bag as possible when sealing it.
 Label the containers with the current date and freeze the apple slices for 6 to 9 months or until you notice freezer burn starting to form.


Apples frozen using the dry pack method can be used for virtually any culinary use.

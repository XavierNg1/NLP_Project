 Measure out all of the dry ingredients and put them in a large mixing bowl. Use a whisk to combine the ingredients for at least 30 seconds. This will ensure that they absorb the wet ingredients evenly. You'll need to whisk together:2 1/4 cups (288 g) of white whole-wheat flour or all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons of baking powder
1/2 teaspoon of baking soda
1/2 teaspoon of coarse salt
3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons of packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon of granulated sugar

, Get out a separate bowl and place 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter in it. Melt the butter in the microwave and let it cool a little. Add the remaining wet ingredients and whisk them together until the eggs are completely incorporated. You'll need to combine the melted butter with:2 cups (473 ml) of buttermilk
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

, Heat your griddle to medium. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a rubber spatula to stir the batter until the dry ingredients are just mixed into the wet ingredients. Carefully fold in the grated zucchini.To fold the zucchini, gently use a twisting motion with your wrist as you incorporate the zucchini into the batter. The goal is to keep the volume, so don't over mix the batter.
 Spray the griddle with cooking spray right before you're ready to cook the pancakes. Once the griddle is hot, pour 1/2 cup (about 175 g) of batter onto the griddle. Cook the pancakes until the edges look dry and bubbles appear and burst on the surface of the pancakes. Flip them over and cook them until they're golden on the other side. Serve the pancakes with maple syrup and butter.Depending on the size of your griddle, you can fit 1 to 6 pancakes at a time.

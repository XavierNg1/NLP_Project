 If you are bitten, don’t overreact, and avoid doing things to excite the hamster. Don’t shake or shout at your hamster. This will only scare it, and make it more likely that it'll bite again. If you are holding the hamster when it bites you, slowly lower it back into the cage. This should cause the hamster to release its grip. If that isn’t enough, slowly pry its jaws open to get your skin out of its mouth.
 Hamster bites can break the skin if their teeth are particularly long, but for the most part should be treated as a minor wound. Wash with soap and water to clean off any blood and pat the wound dry with a clean cloth.If the bite does create a deep puncture wound, and your skin is badly torn with lots of bleeding, apply pressure with a clean, dry cloth, and get to a doctor as soon as possible.
 After cleaning up the bite area, you’ll want to make sure you prevent an infection. Apply an antibiotic cream to the cut, then cover with a clean bandage. Make sure the bandage covers the entire wound., Like other animals, hamster bites can transfer bacteria and other disease to humans, including Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis, rabies, and tularemia.If you are bitten, keep an eye out for additional signs like fever, pain, and failure to heal around the bite area, which could be signs of a more serious problem. If you do notice more serious signs following a hamster bite, contact a doctor immediately.


Rabies is extremely rare in hamsters. Unless the hamster is sick and acting unusual, and rabies is widespread in your area, you are probably not in danger.If you suspect the hamster may be rabid, go to your doctor immediately.

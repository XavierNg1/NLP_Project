 Look for the Google Docs or Google Drive app on your mobile device and tap on it.


You will be brought to the main view with all your docs listed and sorted.
 Unlike on the website, there’s no column title on the mobile app and there’s no Owner column. However, you can still identify shared docs by looking for the icon with two heads right after the filenames. All the files that have this icon are shared files.
 Once you’ve identified a shared doc, tap it to open it. Depending on the access level assigned to you by the owner of the doc, you will be able to edit, comment, or view it.

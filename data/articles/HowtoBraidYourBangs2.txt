 Create a deep side part that is in line with the outer edge of your eyebrowâ€”the part may be on the right or left side. With a comb or your fingers, separate your bangs from the rest of your hair. Pull the remainder of your hair into a low ponytail or secure it to your head with a duck bill clip.


If you have slippery hair, spray your bangs with dry shampoo. This product will remove any excess oil from your tresses and add texture to your locks., Like a French braid, a Dutch Braid will sufficiently prevent your bangs from falling over your eyes.









Grab a small section of your bangs along your deep side part.
Divide this section into three equal strands.
Pull the back strand under the center strand.
Pull the front strand under the right strand.
Add a small amount of hair from the back of the bangs to the back strand. Bring the back strand under the center strand. Add a small amount of hair from the front of the bangs to the front strand. Bring the front strand under the center strand.
Repeat the above step until your bangs are secured in a Dutch braid and the braid reaches the top of your ear., Once you have completed the braid, secure it in place with a small rubber band or clips. To create the illusion of a thicker braid, carefully separate the individual strands of the braid.


Choose a tool that is clear or matches color of your hair.

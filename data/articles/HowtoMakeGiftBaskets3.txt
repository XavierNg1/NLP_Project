 Food-themed gift baskets are among the most common, and the traditional wicker basket is an appropriate fit in many cases. If you want to vary from this, however, try to stick baskets or containers that have a comforting, cozy ambiance.


For example, you could stack wine and cheese items on a cheeseboard, place gourmet coffees and teas in a burlap gift sack, or arrange fruits and wines in a wooden crate., Knowing that you want to treat the recipient to a basket of delicious food is a good starting point, but “food” is too general to stand as a solid theme. Try to pick a specific type of food or common food pairing and work from there.


Popular examples can include:

Wine and cheese baskets, containing one or two bottles of wine and several blocks of cheese to accompany the wine;
Gourmet tea or coffee baskets, accented with tea biscuits or coffee cake;
Chocolate baskets, containing chocolate goodies in multiple forms;
Fruit and nut baskets, offering several types of fresh fruit and cans of salted or flavored nuts.


Think of the receiver's favorite foods. If the receiver loves chocolate, then some type of chocolate theme is probably a good way to go. On the other hand, that same basket would be a bad choice for someone who lacks a sweet tooth.
Consider the time of year. Certain seasons and holidays are associated with different types of food, and you could build a theme around that. For example, autumn is associated with pumpkin, apples, cinnamon, and caramels; winter calls to mind hot chocolate and mint.



If you plan to present the basket later that same day or the following day, you can probably include more fresh foods like fruits, cheeses, and homemade baked goods. These won't work if you're making the basket a week in advance, though.
Opt for preserved foods, commercially prepared foods, or ready-mixes if you need to save the basket for more than a few days. Ready-mixes also work well for recipients who enjoy spending time cooking in the kitchen.

 Under FERPA, once a student has turned 18, you may not share information with his her parent/guardian unless their parent/guardian claimed them as a dependent (as defined by the Internal Revenue Code) for tax purposes or the parent/guardian was appointed as a legal guardian by the court because the student is incompetent. http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html The usual definition of incompetent is having an impairment (disability) that would prevent someone from managing his or her own affairs (i.e. medical affairs, financial affairs). If you violate this, the student may file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Family Policy Compliance Office. The number is 1-800-USA-LEARN (1-800-872-5327). Their address is 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202-852.

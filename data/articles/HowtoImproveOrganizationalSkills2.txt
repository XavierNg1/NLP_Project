 De-cluttering is essential first step in organizing your home. Dump out drawers and remove unnecessary items, throw away expired food, throw out or donate clothes and shoes you haven’t worn in over a year, properly dispose of expired medications, throw out or consolidate empty or half-empty toiletries, and any other items you don’t absolutely need. , Create labeled binders for “Auto Insurance”, “Vacation”, “Receipts”, “Budget”, and any other important item or even in your life.


Try color coding your binders. Blue for Receipts (gas, grocery, clothes), Red for Insurance (auto, home, life), etc.
Keep the binders on an organized shelf.
 Use the often underutilized vertical space in your home. Purchase hooks to hang up bikes in your garage and stand alone (floating) shelves to make efficient and decorative organization spaces.
 Like organizing your office, purchase bins and baskets to put all of your things into. Put similar objects into the same bin and have a system to store your bins. Buy bins and baskets of all sizes to organize everything in your home including utensils, make-up, stuffed animals, food, shoes, and trinkets.

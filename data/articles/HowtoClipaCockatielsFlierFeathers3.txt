 These are new feathers that are growing in to replace lost feathers. A blood feather contains a vein and an artery, providing blood flow the feather needs to develop. In a cockatiel, blood feathers have a dark purple/blue quill (the tube-shaped portion of the feather).
A cockatiel's mature feathers have a pale, opaque, slender quill that does not contain blood.
Blood feathers are often sore and tender to the touch, and handling them at all will hurt your bird.
Clipping a blood feather can cause serious (potentially fatal) bleeding that may require a veterinarian's attention.
 Restrain your bird, and apply pressure to the broken quill shaft with a cotton ball to stop the worst of the bleeding. Apply cornstarch or flour, using a cotton ball or Q-Tip, to the surface of the quill. Do not pack these substances into the feather's shaft. Continue to press firmly until the bleeding stops.You can also use a coagulant like Kwik Stop, available online or at your local pet store. Kwik Stop may sting your bird a little, but it is said to be very effective. It contains a topical anesthetic to treat the pain.
When a blood clot forms, be very careful not to disturb it, or the feather will start bleeding again.
Return your bird to his cage and watch him closely for at least an hour. If he seems weak or listless, or if the bleeding starts up again, see a vet right away.
Even if you successfully stop the bleeding, you may want to take your bird to an avian vet to have the damaged feather completely removed.
 If you are unable to stop the bleeding with pressure and cornstarch, take your bird to the vet right away. If your pet has a medical condition (such as liver disease) that prevents proper blood clotting, a clipped blood feather should be treated as a life-threatening emergency.

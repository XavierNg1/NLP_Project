 Sometimes you have lots of apps running at the same time. This consumes a lot of system memory and can slow down your device and the apps.


To check on iOS, double-tap the Home button to see all the running apps.
To check on Android, open the Application Manager from the Settings then swipe to the left to see the list of Running apps.
 Closing some of the apps you’re currently not using can help free up some memory and speed up your device.


On iOS, swipe up on each of the app you aren’t using to close them.
On Android, swipe away each app that you want to close.
 This step can be optional, but restarting your device can sometimes help free up memory and speed up your apps.
 Look for the Candy Crush app on your device and tap on it. You can now play Candy Crush again.

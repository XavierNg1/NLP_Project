 It's creepy and annoying. If you do it too much, you might be presumed to be a stalker (unless he is obviously looking for a relationship). Look at him when he's talking to you, and then every now and then look down or around then look again. Don't just sit and look straight at him or he will think you are crazy. It's okay to look at him but not 24/7. If you look at him a lot, he might get creeped out.;
, Don't let your anxiety get to you, since it can make you act jittery and weird. Most guys don't like girls that are always shouting, yelling, and screaming.
 It's good to laugh when it's appropriate, but only do so if it's actually funny. Otherwise, it's annoying and he might doubt your sincerity.
 Your hair should be smooth, your skin should be clear and not exceedingly greasy, and please brush your teeth. Nothing is more disgusting than bad breath and BO.
 This could be an instant turn-off.
, Also, don't swear in your attempts to look cool in front of him or attract his attention. Guys like women who are mature and intelligent as well.
 There is nothing like a good facial smile.
 This is a major turn on; think about it, I'm sure you've stood too close to someone that smelled bad. Did it turn you on? I bet not. Wear deodorant and maybe a little bit of perfume, 3 sprays at max. Too much smell can be a turn off, too! Also takes showers and baths every night.

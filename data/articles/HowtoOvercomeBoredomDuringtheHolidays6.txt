 It might sound undesirable but it's better than sitting on the couch moaning. Being active is a good antidote to feeling bored and the act of cleaning can be very inspiring, especially if you clear away last season's stuff and make room for the new things you feel like doing ahead.


Throw out clothes you haven't worn for a long time. Give them to a charity.
Clear off desk and shelf space so that you can see the areas again.
Re-organize a room or two. Changing things around can be a great boredom buster and the newly arranged furniture and items will inspire you.
Clean out the car. Remove all food wrappers, drink containers, crumbs, scrunched up papers, parking vouchers, etc. Give it a thorough dusting and wipe down, plus a spritz with a sweet-smelling spray.
Add something new to your home that is functional and beautiful. It'll take you time to find an object that is both things and that will fit well within your home, so it makes for a good way to dispel boredom.

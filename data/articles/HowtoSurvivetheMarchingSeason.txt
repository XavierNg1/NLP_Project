 The directors are the end all do all on the field. They are the ones who make all the final decisions and should be the last person you go to, if you are struggling with marching band. You should always start near the bottom of the chain of command and work your way up. Respect any other paid staff as well.;
, It's their responsibility to make sure everyone in their section is marching and playing well. They have been chosen as leaders over other upperclassmen in their section.
 These are the people who have been in band longer than most. They have more experience and wisdom than underclassmen, but no decision making abilities.
 Roadies are usually adults and fellow students who load instruments and props. Treat them well, and help them when possible, and you might find that life is a lot easier.
 Memorize your drill spots and coordinates, because if you don't, you will stick out like a sore thumb! You might find that it helps to run through the show by yourself if you get to rehearsal early.
 When you don't know you're music, you are not a box 5 performer.
 Oh, it's sunny and warm when you leave the house? That can change. Quickly. You should always bring layers to change into in case it rains or suddenly drops 30 degrees.
 If you spend months refining your style and learning your spots, why does the band seem to progressively get worse? That's on individual effort. Keep up the motivation until the very end. There are no excuses not to get better.

 If you want to cheat to get the Fateful Encounter Regigigas that was given away at Toys R' Us during the promotion, you'll need to use an emulator or use a physical Action Replay. Using an emulator is much easier, especially if you're already playing a ROM instead of the actual game.
 The code will replace the first Pokémon in your party with the Fateful Encounter Regigigas. Make sure it's a Pokémon that you don't care about, because it will be gone forever.
 The process for this varies depending on the emulator, but it's generally similar. If you're using VBA-M, click "Tools" → "Cheats" → "List cheats."

, This will let you revert your game in case the cheat gives you a Bad Egg, which is possible. A Bad Egg will corrupt your game.


You can create save states from the File menu of most emulators. In VBA-M, click "File" and select "Save State." Choose a slot to create the save state.
 In the Cheats menu, click the "New Cheat" button and paste the following code. Make sure to select "Action Replay" or "Generic Code" if given the option (some emulators will auto-detect code types):94000130 FCFF0000

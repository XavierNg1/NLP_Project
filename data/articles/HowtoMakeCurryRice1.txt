 Add the oil to a wide, sturdy saucepan and place it over a burner set to medium-high. Heat until shimmering or you just barely notice smoke.;
, Transfer these vegetables to the hot pan. They should start to sizzle immediately. If not, increase the heat.


Cook until the vegetables soften. Depending on the heat, this should take around five minutes. Try spreading the vegetables in a single layer and stirring only once every minute or so to shorten the cooking time.
 Don't add the water yet â€” you want the dry rice cooking in the oil. Spread the ingredients flat in the pan. Let them cook for up to five minutes, stirring often. When the rice gains a pearly white color, you're ready to proceed.


This technique of cooking the dry rice in the pan is known as "toasting" the rice. It is used to give the dish a satisfying nutty flavor and, according to some, reduce cooking time., Stir the ingredients to combine. If your pan isn't big enough to hold the water, transfer your ingredients to a steeper-edged pan.
 Turn the heat to high and let the mixture cook uncovered without stirring. Check on the rice every few minutes to monitor its progress.


Eventually, the surface of the rice will appear dry and steam will billow out of small holes (usually after about eight to ten minutes). This is a sign to proceed.
 Turn the burner to the lowest possible heat. Cover the pan snugly with a lid and cook for 15 more minutes. Don't stir or remove the lid during this time.
 After simmering, remove the pan from the burner and take the lid off. Let it stand for five minutes to cool and finish absorbing the water. Use the back of a fork to "fluff" the rice, giving it a little extra volume. Spoon on to serving plates and enjoy.


If the rice still contains a noticeable amount of water, return it to low heat in five minute increments to evaporate the remaining moisture.

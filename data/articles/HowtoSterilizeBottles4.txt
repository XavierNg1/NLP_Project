 This is available in tablet or liquid form at pharmacies and drug stores.
 Choose a glass or plastic container big enough to hold the bottles, lids and nipples you wish you sterilize. Measure out water and liquid or tablet sterilizing solution according to the instructions on the package.
 Make sure they are all completely submerged in the solution. Add the lids and nipples as well.
 Check the solution's packaging for instructions on how long the bottles need to soak. Most manufacturers recommend soaking for at least one hour.
 Use tongs to pick up the bottles, shake off the excess solution and place the bottles on a clean dishcloth to dry.









Make sure your hands are clean when you handle the bottles after sterilizing them.
Do not rinse the bottles. The residue of chemical solution is considered safe to ingest for both adults and babies.
If you wish, you can leave the bottles and other equipment in the chemical solution until you're ready to use them.
Change the solution after 24 hours.

 Lay your pashmina out flat and then fold it in half, connecting opposite corners that are diagonally across from each other. With each hand, pick up the two corners of this triangle youâ€™ve formed that have the smallest angles. Wrap the pashmina around your waist and tie the corners together a couple inches above your right or left hip bone.


If your pashmina sarong is patterned, the clothing that you wear underneath should be solid.You can also wear your pashmina tied this way over the top of a dress, leggings, or a fitted pair of pants., If you are wearing a skirt or dress and want to accentuate your waist, wrap your pashmina around your waist and tie it in a knot. Leave the ends hanging loose, or wrap it around your waist again and tuck the ends back into the loop.


Try out some of the knots used to secure pashminas around the neck as a scarf, but instead secure it around your waist as a belt., If you want to have a fun, loose-fitting skirt, try making one out of your pashmina. Open the garment so that it is entirely open and exposed. Then, hold one end flat to your side and wrap the other around your body 1-2 times until the end meets the first end you are holding to your side. Tie the two together with a double-knot or safety pin them for security.

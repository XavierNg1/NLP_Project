 To stay young looking, make sure to get between 6 and 8 hours of sleep every night. Fatigue can cause your body to release extra cortisol, a stress hormone that breaks down the elasticity of your skin. Getting enough sleep will also prevent puffy eyes and a general worn-down look, which can both be aging., To look younger after 40, make a conscious effort to eat foods that are not processed or high in saturated fat, sugar, or sodium. Many food additives can cause skin inflammation and may have an aging effect on your body. Choose to infuse your diet with antioxidant-rich foods, such as:Kale, spinach, and other leafy green vegetables
Salmon and other fatty fish
Beans, lentils, and peas
Tomatoes
Carrots
Apricots
Blueberries
Nuts

, Staying hydrated is important to help skin looking supple and young. As a general rule, men should drink about 3 liters (13 cups) of fluids per day, while women should drink about 2.2 liters (9 cups). Be sure to drink water before, during, and after exercise to compensate for lost fluids.Drink water before you are thirsty to stay hydrated.
 Exercise can contribute to a youthful appearance by boosting circulation, firming skin, reducing stress, and eliminating excess body fat. Do at least 30 minutes of moderate cardiovascular exercise (i.e. anything that gets your heart rate up to 50 to 60 percent higher than its resting rate) per day, 5 days a week to elicit results.This rate of exercise, if maintained, can decrease cellular aging in your body by nine years.

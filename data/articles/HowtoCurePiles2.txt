 A diet rich in fiber will make your stool easier to pass because fiber helps your stool to become softer. Having softer stools will reduce inflammation. The recommended amount of fiber is around 30 grams per day. For men over 50, 30 grams of fiber a day is recommended, and 38 grams of fiber is suggested for women. Eating vegetables like broccoli, beans, or fresh fruit will provide the necessary intake. You can also take a fiber supplement. Other foods that are high in fiber include:


Fruits like raspberries, pears, apples, bananas, oranges, strawberries, figs, and raisins.
Vegetables like artichokes, green peas, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, and carrots.
Legumes and nuts including split peas, lentils, black beans, almonds, pistachios, and pecans.
Grains, cereal, and pasta including whole wheat spaghetti, bran cereal, oatmeal, popcorn, barley, and rye bread., Drinking water helps prevent flare-ups and speeds up the healing process because a hydrated body can digest food better. Your stool will be softer, causing less strain during bowel movements, reducing the risk of hemorrhoid irritation.The Institute of Medicine recommends that men drink 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids every day and women drink nine cups (2.2. liters) a day., Diuretics like alcohol and caffeine increase urination and can cause dehydration. Dehydration can eventually lead to constipation, which can cause hemorrhoids to flare up or linger. As such, avoid alcohol and caffeine while upping your intake of other, more hydrating fluids like water. Processed foods like instant meals and packaged candy have high amounts of salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats that can impede digestion. Because these foods can also lead to constipation, you should avoid them at all costs to prevent and cure hemorrhoids.

 If you have fabric placemats, do not let any stains or spots sit on the fabric for very long. Remove stains right away, as the longer they sit on the placemats, the more difficult it will be to get them out. Food that tends to stain fabric like tomato, mustard, and coffee should be removed right away if they get on the placemats.You may keep two sets of placemats, one made of vinyl or plastic and one made of fabric. Use the fabric placemats for special occasions, as they will be more difficult to clean if they get dirty.
 Use a clean cloth or a sponge that has been dampened with soap and water. Dab any stains or spots on the mat until they come out. Do not scrub or rub the mats, as this can damage the fabric.Once you have spot cleaned the placemats, let them air dry flat on a clean towel. You can also hang them on a clothesline to dry.
 For stubborn stains, try a cleaner that is safe for use on fabric, such as an all natural cleaner or liquid detergent. Make sure the cleaner does not contain harmful chemicals like bleach or ammonia. Apply a small amount of the cleaner to the mats with a damp cloth or sponge.Let the placemats air dry once you have cleaned them. Make sure all the cleaner is removed on the placemats before you let them air dry.
 Check that the fabric placemats are washing machine safe before you put them in your washer. Most fabric placemats can go in the washing machine. Once you have washed the placemats, let them air dry. Air drying them will ensure they do not get damaged by the high heat of the dryer.


Do not wash towels or clothing with the placemats, as they can lead to pilling. Wash only the placemats and other fabric items like table runners or table cloths together.

 Honey contains trace amounts of hydrogen peroxide so it can gently lighten your hair. To make a natural hair lightening solution, mix 1 to 2 tablespoons (21 to 43 g) of raw honey into 1 cup (237 ml) of water until well blended.For a more nourishing lightening treatment, swap the water for olive oil. Olive oil is extremely moisturizing, but it also has gentle lightening agents so it works very well with honey.
 You can apply it all over your head or target specific areas where you want to add highlights., After you've covered your hair with the honey mixture, let it sit on your locks for 30 to 60 minutes to give it enough time to lighten your hair. If you like, you can place a shower cap over your head and let the honey mixture sit on your hair overnight for more intense lightening results., When youâ€™re ready to get the honey out of your hair, wash it with your usual shampoo. Follow up with a good conditioner, and let your hair air dry.

 Get out a small sauce pot and pour 1 cup (240 ml) of water into it. Add 1 tablespoon of flour into the water and whisk the mixture to break up any lumps. Try to dissolve the flour in the water.

If you don't have a whisk, you can use a fork to quickly combine the water and flour.
 Turn the heat on to high until it begins to boil. One it's bubbling, turn the heat down to medium-low. It should only bubble a little. Simmer the mixture for 30 minutes. Turn off the heat and let it cool.

Cooking the flour and water mixture will make your fake blood thick.
 Pour 2 tablespoons of red food coloring into the cooled flour and water mixture. Whisk or stir the red food coloring until the color is completely mixed into the thick mixture.

You can add more red food coloring for a brighter shade of fake blood.

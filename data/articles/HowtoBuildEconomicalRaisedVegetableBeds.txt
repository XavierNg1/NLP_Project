 Take one of the 2"x4" planks and offer it up to one of the 4' scaffolding planks, allowing 10cm to protrude from what will be the bottom of your frame. The finished bed frame will be 45cm deep (2x 22.5 cm width of scaff plank) - so you leave a 10cm 'foot' at the bottom to help anchor it in the ground.;
, Pre-drill the holes for 2 screws, through the scaff plank and the support 2x4 from the outside. Use a drill bit smaller than the screw width. This is vital, as the screws are so long, they become impossible to tighten without pre-drilling.


Attach the scaff plank to the support 2x4.
Repeat until you have your frame completed frame.
 Measure out a 6x4' area on the ground where you want your raised bed to sit and mark it using sticks and string - this will ensure your edges are straight. (Choose a sunny spot for best veg results.) Make sure you have the required 10cm depth dug at the corners for the frame feet.


Dig over the top layer of soil, piling the dug earth to the centre.
 With the help of a friend, flip your raised bed frame and lay it, feet first, on to the dug area of the same size. Use the spirit level to ensure the frame is sitting level.
 Your raised bed can be filled with any type of soil. For best results, ensure that the soil is well raked.

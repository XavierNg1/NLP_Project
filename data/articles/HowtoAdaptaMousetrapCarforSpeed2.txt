 Reducing the weight will lower rolling friction with the ground. Trim the deck down so it is only as large as necessary to support the mousetrap. When gluing down the deck, put it as close to the back wheels as possible without touching them.


Drill holes in nonessential components to reduce weight. Consider drilling holes in the frame and the wheels.The material used for the frame of the car should be as lightweight and as rigid as possible. Consider bamboo, balsa wood, or foam.Use glue whenever you need to attach something. Tape can be used too, but glue is smoother and weighs less. Whatever you do, don't use metal bolts. They add weight.
 A complicated system of gears and pulleys can be useful when building a racer for distance, because they increase the overall torque. However, when building for speed, they principally serve to create more friction between the components. Consider connecting the lever directly to the axle when building a car for speed., As speed increases, so too does air resistance, making it a progressively more likely to stop your car in its tracks. To prevent this from happening, make sure that as little surface area as possible is exposed. Experiment with different materials for frames to see what is most aerodynamic.


If you are using a wood frame, sand it and paint it. This will make it more aerodynamic.Similarly, reduce the surface area of the car to reduce air resistance. For example, find a thinner frame and wheels.
 Your car can lose a lot of energy at the point where the axle touches the frame. Watch these surfaces to see if the axle seems to get stuck. Try applying a lubricate, like graphite powder. Alternatively, redesign the axle. Consider installing ball bearings.You can search online for a chart of coefficients of friction, to determine which materials have the least friction when paired.

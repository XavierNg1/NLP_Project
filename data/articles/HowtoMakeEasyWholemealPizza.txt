, Put the flour and margarine in a large mixing bowl together. Using you fingers, mix until the mixture becomes like crumbs.
 Using a fork, stir in the milk until the crumbly mixture becomes a dough.


If it is still crumbly, add more a bit milk.
 Use your hands to gently shape the dough.


If you want one large pizza, make all of the dough into one ball.
If you want smaller multiple pizzas, split the dough into smaller balls.
 Spread flour on the table and flatten it first with your hands, then roll it out using a rolling pin. It should end up about 1cm (⅜") thick.
 Try to cover most of the pizza, leaving about 2-3cm (1") around the edge as crust.
 Sprinkle as much as you want; some people don't like a lot of cheese on top though, and that's fine too. If you love cheese, sprinkle enough cheese so that you can barely see the tomato purée.
 See the suggestions outlined above, or just let your imagination flow and make new combinations you've never tried before. This is the part where you can be most creative, which is always a fun thing in the kitchen. Add as many or as few toppings as you'd like, being careful not to add too many or the pizza won't be as easy to eat.


Make sure to place heavier toppings like chicken, sausage or onion below and lighter ones like spinach, peppers or sweetcorn on top.
Make sure that you cook any meat (except pepperoni) beforehand. While in the oven, the pieces of meat will get heated but not properly cooked through.
,, Feel proud that you've just made your own healthy, nourishing and very yummy pizza.

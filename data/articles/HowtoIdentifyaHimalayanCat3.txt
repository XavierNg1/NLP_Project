 If you want to adopt a cat from a breeder, make sure to find a reputable breeder. Reputable breeders will do health certifications to screen for genetic health problems. They also will raise kittens at home and won’t isolate them.Start by checking cat breed websites, such as The Cat Fanciers’ Association, The Fanciers Breeder Referral List, and The International Cat Association.
If you visit breeder websites, watch for red flags. These include immediately available kittens, multiple litters, paying online with a credit card, and your choice of any kitten.
 Instead of going to a breeder, consider adopting a Himalayan cat. Try Himalayan rescue organizations, such as The Persian and Himalayan Cat Rescue and The Purebred Cat Rescue.

Try pet adoption websites. Always double check the characteristics of any advertised Himalayan cat to make sure that the cat is in fact a Himalayan.
You can also check your local shelter.
 Finding your perfect Himalayan cat may take time. If you are interested in getting a cat from a breeder, be aware that some breeders may not let Himalayans be adopted until they are old enough to start showing their point colors, which may be between nine and twelve weeks.Make sure to search all avenues, including adoption or rescue, before deciding on whether you are going to adopt an adult cat or get a kitten from a breeder.

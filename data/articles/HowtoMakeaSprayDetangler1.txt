 Leave-in or rinse-out conditioner will work for this purpose. A quality conditioner adds oils to your hair, helping them slide past each other without tangling.


To make your own conditioner, try Â½ cup (120mL) Greek yogurt, 3 tbsp (45mL) honey, and 5 tbsp (75mL) natural oil. A light or medium oil such as grapeseed or olive oil works best, since you'll leave this mixture sitting in your hair.;
, Although you can use conditioner on its own, oil gives the mixture more "slip," which makes curly hair much easier to detangle without breaking. Add the oil about a tablespoon (15mL) at a time, mixing well. Test it on your hair after each spoonful, detangling with your fingers. Keep adding oil until the hair strands glide past each other seamlessly.


While you can use any type of oil, a heavy oil can leave your hair feeling greasy and limp. Try grapeseed oil or olive oil instead.
Each person's hair requires different amounts of oil. If you rarely have issues with dry hair, you may even be able to skip this step.
 Look for a heavy-duty, reusable spray bottle, or rinse out another bottle and attach a spray top. Cheap spray bottles wear down quickly, making them more expensive and tiresome in the long run.
 Spray your hair with the detangler. Gently detangle with your fingers, a wide-toothed comb, or a rubber-bristled brush. When finished, just leave the spray in your hair. This will keep your curls shiny and bouncy, and avoid damage from excessive rinsing.


If your hair feels too greasy after detangling, try making the spray with a lighter oil.
 Depending on the length and thickness of your hair, you may need more or less detangler spray than you bottled. Homemade conditioner goes bad within one or two weeks. If using it as the basis of our spray, only make enough to last one or two sittings.

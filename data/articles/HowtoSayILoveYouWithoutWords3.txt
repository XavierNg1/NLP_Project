 There is nothing wrong with buying a gift from the store, but the thought and time that goes into making a gift for someone can really say “I love you.” Think about things that are special in your relationship to incorporate into a gift. It can be something as simple as framing pictures from a vacation, or as involved as building your partner a piece of furniture. This is an instance where the thought really does count., Maybe your partner had a favorite toy when they were growing up, or they love a certain brand of honey that isn’t available where you live. Go out of your way to try and find a special something for your loved one and they will really appreciate the effort. Not only are you giving them a gift, but you are also showing how well you know them and how much you listen to them., While each partner should contribute in any kind of relationship, you shouldn’t expect the immediate reciprocation of a gift. With holidays like Christmas or anniversaries as exceptions, your partner may not even know that you intend to give a gift. Allow them to appreciate you and give them time to put back into the relationship.

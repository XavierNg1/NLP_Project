 The onion should be chopped into small pieces and the garlic should be minced.
 Simmer the mixture for about 5 minutes, uncovered.
 Let it cool on the side.
 Strain the wine mixture into the saucepan (removing the solid onion and garlic pieces). Mix well until the texture is smooth. Then add the Tabasco sauce, salt, oil, and honey. Stir through.
 Do not leave the mustard unattended at this stage as once it begins to thicken, the constant stirring is essential for a good consistency.
 Store the mustard in a non-metallic container. It should keep for up to 8 weeks.

It is recommended that you keep the mustard in the refrigerator for about two days before consuming, as this will help to blend all the flavors.

 This part of the guide will help you decide if it is a good screenshot or not.;
, Then try to get a screenshot of it.
 People will be unhappy if they detect the slightest cheat (e.g. moonjump or infinite ammo)

,


Does the screenshot have any unnecessary stuff, such as more people or a gun in the way?
Is the screenshot messed up in any way?

,, Look for things that stand out. Example: If you took a shot of two people shooting each other with spartan lasers, would you name it Laser Pointers or Flaming Hot Spartans? Is the screenshot weird, cool, or funny?

, When a friend is online, just click on his profile and hit send screenshot (or something along those lines).

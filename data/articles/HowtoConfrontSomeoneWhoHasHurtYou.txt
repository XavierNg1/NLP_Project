 Don’t blame, just state your feelings. Use “I feel …” statements, not “you did …” statements.;
, You don’t have to resolve every argument you ever had with this person.
 Since you’re the one who’s called this meeting, you get to decide what topics will be discussed. Again, writing down what you want to talk about might help. Stay in control, stay calm, stick to your agenda, don’t get pulled down rabbit trails. If the other person starts blaming you (and they likely will do so) just acknowledge their feelings, which leads to the next point:

, While it may seem counter-intuitive, listen as much as you talk. When the person responds, repeat what they've said to make sure you understand. One of the most effective ways to confront someone is to “hold up a mirror” by repeating what he has said or describing what she has done. You might say, “This is what I hear you saying...” Repeat or rephrase what the person has just said to you. Quite often, they’ll feel understood and gratified that someone else can articulate what they are feeling or thinking.
 Don’t get sucked into old patterns. Your job here is not to fix the other person or make them feel better. It is to have an honest conversation.
 Own what is yours, but don’t accept blame for what is not.
 Your freedom is not dependent on their apology, but on your own decision to confront and set boundaries. “More commonly, a person’s first response is a fierce defensive reaction to being confronted,” Clinton and Springle write.
 It doesn’t mean we have to blindly trust again. It doesn’t mean the hurt is magically erased. Reconciliation is based on trust, and trust must be proven over time.”

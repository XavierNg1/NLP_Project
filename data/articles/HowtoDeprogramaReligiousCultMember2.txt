 The cult may try to shut you away from the person. Don't give them any excuses. Tell the person that you're there for them, and they can contact you any time., The cult leader hopes that you'll do something drastic, that will make the person shun you. Don't do that.Instead, be there for them and be kind. Invite them to hang out with you. Send cards, emails, or letters. Keep showing your love., This helps remind the person that their old life is still there for them, and they can come back to it. For example, "Jean is holding a party on Saturday and she's hoping you can come" and "Your brother said he misses you.", The person may believe that the world revolves around their cult. However, they are unlikely to be open to other ideas unless they come to them., Being pushy or confrontational may lead to their resenting you and strengthen their faith in the cult. They may considerÂ your efforts religious persecution. Be kind, loving (even to strangers) and understanding with them., A cult keeps people in by its magnetizing and entrancing environment, so if the person gets away from this environment, they'll have space to think and reflect.A place with limited internet or phone will be especially helpful in giving them time away from the cult.
Use the vacation to have fun, not to press your views onto the person. The conclusion that the cult isn't perfect needs to come from the person.
 This helps build trust. The easier it is to leave a cult, the more likely the person will leave, so make your place be easy to access.

 Remove the knots in your hair by brushing it backwards, preferably without creating any parting. This will give you the perfect slicked-back look.
 Twist a section of hair three times and push it forward to create a little bump. Pull it up and secure it with a bobby pin.
 Pull your remaining hair into a semi-high ponytail at the back of your head and secure it with a hair tie.
 Roll the ponytail around repeatedly to create a bun. Use bobby pins to keep it in place.


To prolong the style, spray the bun and the twisty bump with hairspray.

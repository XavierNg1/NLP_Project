 Call or text one of your friends. You may not have seen them in a while because you might have time off from school, so you should catch that person up on what’s going on in your life and ask them about theirs. Try to immerse yourself in the conversation so that you are a little distracted from the fact that it’s Christmas.
 If you want to distract yourself from the fact that it’s Christmas Eve, you should do an activity that isn’t related to Christmas. For example, you could try one of the following activities:


Read
Write
Draw something
Play a musical instrument
Exercise
Take a bath

, The fastest way to pass the time will be to fall asleep, because when you wake up, it will be Christmas morning! However, sometimes it’s hard to fall asleep on Christmas Eve. Here are some ways that you can try to fall asleep faster:


Wear noise cancelling headphones to counteract distracting noisesWear socks to bed
Take a warm shower before you try to fall asleep
Go to your “happy place”
Listen to music

 Especially ones with skull and crossbones designs or red and black ones. When not wearing a bandana, make your hair a bit messy. You can also use an eye patch; get one at your local costume store.
 White, ivory, beige, cream and tan peasant shirts are great for the look. Skull t-shirts are also great. Plain black, white or beige shirts with cut-off sleeves are a great addition to your wardrobe. Brightly colored long sleeve button ups are piratey. Just make sure they are loose, not stiff like a shirt a corporate executive might wear to the office. And make sure you leave all of it untucked but the very front, creating a sagging look (regardless of how it's finished) and unbutton the top few buttons.
 Capris, capris, capris or large cotton harem pants. These are incredibly piratey if they have the right knicker-looking characteristics! Avoid denim and other recent additions in fabrics. Stick to hemp, cotton, wool and other natural fabrics. Keep them in brown and natural colors. It's a good idea to tear of the hem to make them look a bit more tough, but also keep them baggy, because they would have been real knickers, stolen from men. If you live in a cooler climate, you should probably wear long, flowing pants in the winter. Avoid short skirts. You could wear calf length skirts with harem pants and tall boots.
 Costume jewelry is perfect for this--what would you have pilfered from another ship?

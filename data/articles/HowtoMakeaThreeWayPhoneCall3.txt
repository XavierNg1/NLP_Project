 When that call is established, dial the number of the second person.
 When you press this, the first person is put on hold, and the call is made.
 When the second person answers, press SEND to create the conference call.


If the second person does not answer, press SEND twice to end the connection and return to the first person.






Note per Verizon: If you are traveling and the instructions don't work, or if you are in OH, MI, MN, SD or Southern IL, you will also need to press SEND before dialing the number of the second person.

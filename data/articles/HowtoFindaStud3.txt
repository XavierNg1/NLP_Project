 Hanging items on a plaster wall can be easier than hanging them on drywall because plaster is applied to an interior layer of wood lath. Lath is generally strong enough to handle any item weighing less than 10-15 lbs. But for heavier items like television sets you’ll still need to find at least one stud., An electronic stud finder that measures changes in the depth of the wall will not work on plaster. But a magnetic stud finder or particularly strong magnet can indicate where the wood lath has been nailed onto the stud.


A metal detector can also show you where the lath has been nailed to the stud.If you use any of these methods remember to find multiple studs and measure the distance between them to make sure that you haven’t found a metal pipe or wire that isn’t attached to the stud.
 You can find studs in drywall by driving a pin through the wall to see if it hits the stud. But plaster is generally too tough for a pin to penetrate. A pin also won’t go through the wood lath in any case.


The knock test will still work for plaster. Knock on the wall to see if a stud is present. An area with no stud will produce a low, hollow sound, while an area with a stud will produce a higher, more solid sound.
Using switches and outlets to find studs will also work. Any electrical switch or outlet will be mounted on a stud. Turn off the electricity to the switch or outlet and remove the plastic cover to see on which side of the stud the switch or outlet is mounted by looking for the screws.
 You may not need to worry about studs if you use a strong enough wall anchor. Some wall anchors are strong enough to hold several hundred pounds, whether on drywall or plaster. Always remember to read instructions carefully before hanging anything on a wall anchor to avoid serious damage to your wall.

 Knees should be bent. Start slowly, at first, for safety.
 If you want to turn clockwise, you will be sliding on your left foot. If you want to turn counterclockwise, you will be sliding on your right foot.
 Your foot should be perpendicular to the direction you are traveling. This will create friction against the floor. Hold this position until you come to a stop.


Straighten the leg and angle the wheels so they slide on the floor. This friction is what will cause you to stop.
Keep the other leg bent at the knees as the skate rotates approximately 180 degrees. All your weight should be on this leg.

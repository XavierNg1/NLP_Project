 If you are in an orchestra or band at school, the group will always have a note that everyone will tune with. Most will play a concert “C” or “G.” During rehearsals, your group will let you know what note they will be tuning to. You will be responsible for transposing a half note below the said note.


If the band is tuning to a concert “C,” you will tune the clarinet to a D., Always start with the lowest octave on your clarinet. Tuning with a band requires you to utilize your ears over anything else. Determine if your low octave is in-tune by focusing on your own sound in relationship to everyone else.
 Make adjustments to the low octave by adjusting the upper barrel. Pull the barrel when sharp and and push the barrel when flat. Make your adjustments in intervals of about half a millimeter.It’s better to tune at home before practicing with the band. This way you are ready and won’t need to make large tuning adjustments.
 Usually a band will play the tuning note twice. The second time is for you to check the tuning of the higher octave of your clarinet. During the second duration of the tuning note, play the higher octave of D. Again, the higher octave is usually out of tune and a bit sharp., Make adjustments to the higher octave by adjusting the halfway section. Pull the halfway part when sharp and push the halfway part when flat. Make your adjustments in intervals of about half a millimeter.


Make sure you line up your bridge key after making adjustments.

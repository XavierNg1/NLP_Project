 Begin using the cup at one meal per day once the child is familiar with the cup. This may occur at eight to ten months old. Then, replace your baby's bottle at other meals. Do this until all meals are eaten with a sippy cup instead of a bottle.


Start with meals in the middle of the day and with snacks.
Work on one feeding at a time. Don't rush, but be sure to always make progress.
Offer your child a sippy cup instead of a bottle during other times of the day such as nap time and snack time preparation.
Children are less likely to give up feeding habits first thing in the morning and right before bed. These are times when a child is likely to seek comfort.For weaning the night time bottle, have a bedtime ritual in place such as a warm bath, a story, and a favorite toy. This can help reduce the stress of losing the bottle.
 Going back and forth between the bottle and sippy cup during meals will only confuse the child. Continually diminish the presence of the bottle. Keep track of how frequently your child uses a bottle.

 Hold the stick with your dominant hand, near-vertically, so that the open rim of the head faces you. Leave a few inches of space between your dominant hand and the head of the stick.
 Pull the stick up to a cradling position on your non-dominant side, letting your dominant hand slide to the butt of the stick.
 Work on using the same techniques you use to cradle with your dominant hand. It may feel awkward at first, but with practice it will become more natural.


As you grow as a player, it is very important that you can switch your cradle between your dominant and non-dominant sides. If you are right-handed, for instance, you probably tend to cradle with your right hand on top and your left hand near the butt of the stick. If a defender attacks from your right side, it can be extremely useful to quickly switch your handsâ€”you can dodge to the left or avoid the defender with your left hand on top and your right hand near the butt of the stick.

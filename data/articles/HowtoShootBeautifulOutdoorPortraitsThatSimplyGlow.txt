 With the rise of digital cameras these are now VERY affordable. Consider purchasing a used camera and optics.;
, This lens has the best optics (by far) and allows you to shoot in dim light without a flash. DO NOT use a zoom lens - bad optics and they require too much light.
 100 is best but 200 will do. DO NOT set it at 400 or above, as this creates "noise" and grain--unacceptable in fine portraits.
 This is by far the single most important factor in creating a fine portrait without expensive studio lighting. The quality of light during this time is unequaled. NEVER shoot portraits in full sun.
,, Do not put your subject closer than 15 feet (4.6Â m) to anything - you want a blurred background with no distractions.
 Most people stand back way too far from their subject.
 The first 3 or 4 shots the model will be nervous (you are probably closer to them than they are used to) - Try keep them relaxed and smiling. Ask them to look slightly away from the camera - they should be looking at your shoulders or just a foot or two to your side. For a great portrait take several images with the same pose.
 DO NOT get glossy - portraits always look better in matte finish.

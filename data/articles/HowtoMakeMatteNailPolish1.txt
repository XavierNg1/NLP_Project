 Once you paint your nails, you will have to work quickly, or the polish will dry and become hard to work with. Here is a list of what you will need to have ready:


Basecoat and nail polish
Baking powder
Tightly-woven sifter
Small dish or container
Small, soft makeup brush;
, You will need to break up any clumps that are in the powder, or they will ruin the surface of your manicure. If you still see any clumps, break them up using a toothpick.
 Be sure to apply a basecoat first. Then, choose any nail polish you want, and paint your nails with it. Leave the other hand unpainted for now; this is so that the nail polish does not dry out too quickly.
 Dip the brush into the baking powder, then gently sweep the brush over the wet nail polish. The powder will stick to the polish. Dip the brush into the baking powder each time before you brush your nail with it. If you don't do this, the bristles will get caught in the wet polish and become ruin.








Make sure that your nails are evenly coated with the baking powder. If there are any gaps in the powder, there will be gaps in the matte effect.
Make sure that you are using a soft-bristled makeup brush. If the brush is too stiff, it may cause streaks in the manicure.
 This will be enough time for a thin layer of baking powder to sink into the nail polish, giving it a matte effect.
 Be sure to remove any specks of powder. Your nails should now be matte. If the powder has dried into the polish, dip the brush into some water and try brushing the powder off again. This should help remove the stuck powder.
 Apply a basecoat and some nail polish, then dust your nails with baking powder. Brush the powder off using a clean brush.
 Your nail polish may still look glossy while wet, so it may be a good idea to let it dry completely in order to see the final results. Also, you might want to avoid using a topcoat. Most topcoats are glossy, and will take away the effect. If you can find a matte one, then use that.

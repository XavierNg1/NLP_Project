Scan the Internet for a design you desire. You donâ€™t necessarily need the large design to fit the chair right now. Instead find something that not only you like, but one you know you can cut out on the chair.



 


Look for designs that emphasize the skull shape and not color or fine lines. You will need a basic design that can be translated to your plastic chairs.





;
, Either you can copy it onto the chair from an enlarged pattern or you can use it as inspiration or a guide for your design.


Measure the chair area. Measure just the area that will hold the skull design on your chair.






Take a 81/2 x 11 printout to a local copy shop to have it enlarged. Make sure the design is not trademarked as you could have trouble having it enlarged at a commercial copy shop. Request light or transparent paper so that you can trace and/or transfer the design to the chair.
 Consider using a pencil or brightly colored chalk to draw your outline instead of a permanent magic marker.


Perform a rough sketch or trace the outline of your skull design and then stand back to make sure the outline resembles a skull. What may translate well on paper may not look the same on plastic. Before you make this change permanent you may want to look at it from all angles before cutting.

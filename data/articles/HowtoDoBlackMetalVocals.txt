 Secular black metal is about evil, death, and depression. Make the sound you think somebody would make with their last breath if they were slowly dying. Use that sound to form words. However, Christian black metal is about positive/negative topics related to Christian beliefs.;
, Do you want a Marduk "argh I messed up my voice" sound, a Krieg/Burzum "pitched" sound, a Chthonic "Screamed" sound, Malevolentia "Shriek" sound, or the "Sabbath" burp?"

, Singers and vocal stylists use the terms "chest voice" and "head voice" to refer to using different parts of their vocal chords to achieve different effects.For a shout like, Krieg-esque approach, you'll want to practice singing in chest voice quite high, but not breaking into head voice.
 This should produce a quite high, shout like sound if you're doing it right.
, Many trainers/teachers will tell you that this is a really bad thing to do, singing without diaphragmatic support, but in some instances - such as in a soprano voice - it can't hurt.

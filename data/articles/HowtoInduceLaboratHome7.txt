 If you are committed to a home birth, you should still have a doctor or midwife present. Most doctors will not rush to induce labor unless there are extenuating circumstances, including when:


Your water breaks, but there are no contractions.
You are two weeks past your due date.
You have an uterine infection
You have gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, or not enough amniotic fluid.
There is a problem with the placenta or baby's positioning/growth., With gloved fingers, the doctor will reach into the cervix and rub the membrane of the amniotic sac until it separates from the uterine wall. Naturally-released hormones then usually kick-start labor., Known medically as a "amniotomy," the doctor uses a thin hook to break the amniotic sac. This almost always brings on labor within a few hours.


While it is short, this may be painful and uncomfortable.
 It may be applied directly to the vagina or taken orally. This usually happens in a hospital, and it thins out the cervix to prepare it for labor.


This often leads to strong cramping and some pain., This is generally for slowed or stalling labor. In emergencies, like those outlined above, it can also help induce labor.


Labor induced with oxytocin often leads to more frequent contractions., These strategies do not always work, especially if the body is not quite ready to go into labor. If you've tried to induce labor and it failed, it is imperative to get to a medical facility. The following risks and precautions should be carefully minded:


Infection (especially if water has broken)
Tears in the uterine wall
Late pre-term babies (beginning labor prematurely)
Irregular contractions.

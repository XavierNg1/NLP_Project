 Since there are a variety of different styles, sizes and colors available, pick a few different bags that have all of these features.;
, Is there plenty of room to fit all of your items comfortably? Are the items constricted inside the bag? Is it difficult to zip the makeup bag close? Does it fit inside your purse? Does it contain a zipper or a Velcro adhesive closure?

, Zipper closures stay closed even when the makeup bag shifts around in your purse. Makeup bags with Velcro closures are more likely to come open when your makeup bag is moved around in your purse. This movement can also cause your cosmetic items to come out of the bag and come open while inside your purse-leading to stains inside your purse.
 Check to see if this compartment is removable, which makes it easier to clean. A makeup bag organizer keeps all of your cosmetic items neat and makes finding your items a lot easier when you are in a hurry.
 Some cosmetic bags come with several pockets, while others come with only a few pockets for powder and lipsticks.
 Nylon, polyester or microfiber makeup bags are easy to clean with a damp washcloth. Many of these can also be hand washed with a gentle detergent when powder or other substances stain the outside or the inside of the makeup bag. Make sure the cosmetic bag has the same material on the inside.
 Does it provide good protection for your makeup products? Does it prevent your items from moving around too much while they are inside the bag?

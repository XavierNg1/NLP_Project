 You should never decide to do a cleanse if you are sick. Detoxing and/or fasting can exacerbate illnesses and slow down healing. If you are under the weather, injured, or battling a more serious medical concern, take this time to recover and consider a cleanse at a later time.You may be wanting to address symptoms like difficulty sleeping, headaches, or constipation.
Consider whether or not these symptoms could be due to some kind of illness or condition.
Always check with your doctor before doing a cleanse.
 Drastically altering your lifestyle—even for just a few days—can be stressful and tiring in and of itself. As such, avoid trying to do a cleanse when you are under stress for other reasons. In order to be successful with your cleanse regimen, select a time when you don’t have a lot on your plate.You’ll be most successful with the cleanse if you are not busy while doing it.
Try doing this over a weekend, or during a break from work or school.
Additionally, think about any social obligations you may have. You’ll have more success if you can avoid going to parties and other gatherings.
For example, over the holidays is not a great time to try for a cleanse.
 Although moderate activity can be perfectly fine during a cleanse, high-intensity exercise should be avoided. If you are an athlete, do not plan to cleanse during periods of intense training.All cleanses involve some level of calorie restriction.
Exercising on a drastically reduced calorie regimen can weaken your muscles and lead to injury.
If you are doing a very restrictive liquid fast, you may feel very tired and may avoid activity altogether.
 At it’s core, cleansing means restrictive eating. As such, cleansing should only be undertaken if you feel confident about your relationship with food.This can trigger negative past relationships with food, such as food avoidance, binge/purge cycles, overeating, and others.
If you have a history of disordered eating, cleansing is not recommended.

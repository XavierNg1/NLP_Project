 Tuvaro will often add a command to the end of your browser shortcut icons which reloads the Tuvaro software when you start the program. All of your installed browsers may be affected. There are several places that you may have shortcuts, and you will need to make changes to each individual shortcut:


Desktop
Start menu
Taskbar
Quick Launch

, Select "Properties" from the menu.
 This can be found in the Shortcut tab.
 For example, the Internet Explorer target may be shown as "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe""http://AdProgram.com". Remove the "http://AdProgram.com" from the end of the target line.


If none of your shortcuts have an address at the end, then one of the malware scanners already took care of it. This isn't guaranteed though.
, Leaving just one shortcut unchanged can reverse everything you've done when it's used.

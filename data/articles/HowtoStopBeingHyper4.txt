 If nothing seems to help with your hyperactivity, you might consider seeing a doctor.


If you suspect that you have ADHD, bipolar disorder, or something else more complex than just hyperactivity, speak to a specialist.
 Sometimes, it helps to talk about your hyperactivity. People trained in the treatment of hyperactivity will be able to advise you further.


They may suggest stress reducing techniques like: counting from 1 to 10, "silent screaming", or other activities that help reduce anxiety when hyperactivity gets in the way of daily life.
Counselors or therapists will also be able to advise you on whether or not to seek prescription help for you hyperactivity., If nothing else is helping enough, it's time to see a medical doctor. See a doctor, especially, if you have trouble concentrating at work, can't keep schedules, constantly forget things, and/or if the stress caused by these issues starts to feel difficult to deal with.


There is no verified test that proves whether you have ADHD or not. The doctor will most likely have you fill out surveys that will examine your behavior in the past and the present, identify situations where you felt too hyper, and take into account how your hyperactivity affects others.
Doctors will most likely advise sufferers to follow a "multimodal" plan. These plans use a variety of techniques to curb your hyperactivity. This includes various prescriptions for hyperactivity. The most common medication is Adderall. Doctors will most likely encourage you to seek out behavioral therapy as well.

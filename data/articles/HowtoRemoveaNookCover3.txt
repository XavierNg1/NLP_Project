 Find the flap in the lower right corner that says “Nook” on it. Lift this flap to reveal a memory card if your Nook has one. Remove the memory card. You’ll also see the two screws under the flap.
 If your nook has never been worked on, there will be one or two pieces of tape covering the screws. Remove the tape, but be wary that this voids your Nook’s warranty. Use a size T5 Torx screwdriver to remove both screws. Set them somewhere you won’t lose them., Use the prying tool provided with your Nook, or a flat plastic tool. Do not use a metal tool as you could break the nook. Carefully insert the tool between the back cover and the Nook Color’s main body and begin prying the cover off., Once the corner is pried off, slide the tool around one side to begin separating the back cover from the rest of the nook. When there is enough space in the gap, use your fingers to pry the back cover all the way off. Go slowly and be careful to avoid breaking the cover.

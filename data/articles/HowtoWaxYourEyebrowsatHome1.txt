 You will need microwaveable grooming wax, tweezers, a makeup brush or Popsicle stick, a brow comb





;
, Next, prepare to do the upper region of one brow. Only wax one brow at a time so that you can concentrate on what you’re doing. You don’t want any of it to get in your eye! If you feel jittery at all doing it yourself, then stop and have someone else it apply it for you.
 Only microwave for 10 to 15 seconds, 5 to 10 seconds if less than half is in the jar. Don’t let it come to a boil, though, which it can easily. Stir to make sure it’s evenly heated. (It should be the consistency of warm honey.) 







, Quickly but carefully, while the wax is still warm, glide the wax on the hair that you want removed above the brow. Next, place a strip of fabric over the area, press firmly and rub over it going in the same direction that the hair grows. Let it set for a few seconds, and then pull it off. But don’t worry! It only grabs the hair, not the skin, so it shouldn’t be painful.
 Then, using the comb side, gently comb the hair upwards. Trim any excess and long hairs (only the ones sticking over the comb) by cutting straight across with the scissors. Be careful to not cut into the actual brow. 







, You’re working with a small area. Be careful you don’t get wax on the area you just finished! If you do, though, just dab a little baby oil on it to remove it.
 You don’t want to skip this step, as it reduces puffiness and redness in just a couple minutes. Wait a few minutes, then wipe off. 







, Take your time. You want it to match as perfectly as possible to the other brow. Otherwise, you’ll have eyebrows with two different shapes! Put soothing lotion onto the areas when you’re finished.
 No one’s brows are perfect, even after waxing. This helps make them look more symmetrical.

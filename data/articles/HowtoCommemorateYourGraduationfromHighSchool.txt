 A vacation can be a wonderful way to commemorate your achievements, and it can also be a great way to rest up after a long, tedious senior year. Try exploring a new city or even a new country if you long for some change in your life! Whether your trip be short or long, you take a road trip, go by plane, or use the train, a vacation can be an excellent activity to connect with the outside world and observe an honorable achievement.;
, A party can be a great way to celebrate your graduation. You can invite your friends, family and relatives, plan a cookout, and do whatever else you feel is a worthwhile way to celebrate your high school graduation.
 Graduating can be a wonderful incentive to purchase a gift. Feel free to get something expensive, such as an iPad 2 or a new TV, since finishing your senior year is a mammoth milestone!

, Your parents supported you all through high school and helped you to meet your state's graduation requirements, so it is important to be reciprocal and do something for them as well. It is advisable to let them choose the restaurant.
 This is a great way to highlight some of your best memories from all four years of high school. If you have pictures, it is recommended to include them as well.
 In addition to having the support of your parents, your teachers taught you what is necessary to learn in high school, and they helped you meet graduation requirements. Try creating a humorous poem, giving a gift card, or producing original songs for the teachers.

 If you want to add a ton of new brushes, you can make your life much easier by just dragging and dropping them into the correct folder. This is effective for both Windows and Mac computers.


Make sure Photoshop is closed before beginning.
 The two different paths are outlined below. However, on a Mac all you have to do is Cmd-Click on the Photoshop icon to bring up the folder.



Windows: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop\

Mac: /Users/{YOUR USERNAME}/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Adobe Photoshop ___/

, This is where Adobe organizes all of your brushes for you, and where Photoshop looks when searching for new brushes.
 Once you've opened the .ZIP file, click and drag the .apr into the Brushes folder. The next time you open Photoshop, the new brushes should be there for you, ready to use.

 Arrange is so that the bottom corner of the square is pointing toward you, and the top corner is pointing away from you.









This fold can be completed with a wrinkly napkin, since wrinkles and creases add texture and make it look more interesting. However, if you're worried about your guests using wrinkly napkins, you may press the napkins first.If you're using a patterned napkin, start with the patterned side facing down against the table.
 Bring the bottom corner up to meet the top corner. The napkin should now look like a triangle, with the bottom edge facing you and the top pointing away from you.
 Starting with the bottom edge facing you, roll the napkin into a long hot-dog shape until you reach the top corner. You'll finish with a long tube-shaped napkin with pointy ends.
 Start with either pointy end and begin rolling it toward the other end. Keep going until the entire tube has been rolled into a spiral. The napkin should now be shaped like a rose. Use your fingers to adjust the shape to make it look more rose-like. Tuck the end into the folds on the underside of the rose.
 This fold looks best displayed in a shallow cup or nestled into a saucer to keep it from coming unrolled.

 You'll need a temporal artery (forehead) thermometer. These are usually digital and work by recording the temperature of infrared heat waves from the temporal artery in the baby's forehead. This type of thermometer can be expensive, but it's easy to use.Temporal artery (forehead) thermometers work reliably in babies of all ages and are likely more accurate than axillary (armpit) thermometers in babies under three months old. (A rectal temperature is still recommended for babies under 3 months old.)

, The temporal artery thermometer will have a circular tip that looks like a flattened knob. Place this sensor head on the center of your baby's forehead.Make sure you're using a digital thermometer designed for temporal artery readings. These are not the same as forehead strips, which should not be used because they're too inaccurate.
 Press down the thermometer's "on" or "start" button while you slowly move the thermometer's sensor across your baby's forehead. Keep holding down the button until you reach the top of the baby's ear.Keep the sensor against your baby's skin the entire time you sweep it across the forehead.
Or, follow the manufacturer's directions on the package, especially while you are learning how to use the thermometer.
 You can stop holding down the button when you get to your baby's hairline. By this point, the thermometer should display your baby's temperature on the digital screen. Record the temperature.The reading should only take a couple of seconds, making this the fastest and one of the most accurate way to take your baby's temperature.

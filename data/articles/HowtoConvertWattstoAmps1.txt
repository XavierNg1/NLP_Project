 For specialized applications, such as home wiring or automotive wiring, there are specific voltage values. Since these values are always the same, it is possible to construct a chart that links a wattage value to an amperage value. These charts are based on the equations that link wattage, amperes (amps), and voltage in any circuit. If you plan to use this type of table, it can be found online. Just make sure that you are using a table with the correct fixed voltage.For example, a house usually uses 120V AC (in the United States) and a car generally uses 12V DC.
You can use an online amperage calculator to make things even simpler.;
, Once you have your chart, you should skim it to find the value you are looking for. These types of charts usually have several rows and columns. There will be a column labeled “Power” or “Watts.” Start there and locate the exact power of the circuit in you are dealing with., When you have located your Watt measurement in the Power column, follow that same row to the “Current” or “Amps” column. There may be several columns on the table, so be sure to read the column titles and ensure that you get the correct value. Once you find the amp column, double check the value to make sure it is in the same row as your Watt value.

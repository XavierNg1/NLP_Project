 The mouthpiece end that inserts into your instrument should be round and clean. There should be no rust or other debris on it. Look for dents and an oval or squashed shape by holding the mouthpiece at eye level or comparing it to an undamaged mouthpiece.
 If your mouthpiece is misshapen at all, use a trueing tool to return it to its correct shape. This tool looks like a skinny T and has a somewhat pointed end. To use, insert the tool into the end of your mouthpiece. Tap it very gently with a rubber mallet (not a hammer!). The tool will force the mouthpiece end to become rounded., Give a gentle clockwise twist when inserting the mouthpiece. When removing the mouthpiece, give a counter-clockwise twist. It should not turn more than about a half of a rotation, if that. Never bang in the mouthpiece.Over time, the twisting will have a threading effect and make the mouthpiece less likely to be stuck.
 Always remove the mouthpiece before putting the instrument in its case. Place the instrument in the case properly. Do not put extra items like music or other items in the case where they don’t fit.
 Keeping your mouthpiece clean will help ensure that it fits properly and smoothly into your instrument. Wash it carefully with warm water and mild soap, drying it afterwards with a soft cloth. Periodically, apply a little dab of valve or key oil to the insertion end., Dropping a mouthpiece on a hard surface such as tile or concrete is sure to dent or otherwise damage your mouthpiece. Even dropping a mouthpiece on carpet can risk damaging it. If you drop the mouthpiece, inspect it right away to ensure that it is still round. If it’s dented, use a trueing tool to reshape the insertion end.

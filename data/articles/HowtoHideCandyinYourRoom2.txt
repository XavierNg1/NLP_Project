 You don't have to make a secret cubby to hide your candy. You can use what you have in your room, such as a sock drawer or tissue box. This section will give you a few ideas on where you can hide candy in your room.
 Find a tissue box, then carefully lift out the entire stack of tissues. Place your candy in a thin layer along the bottom, then place the stack of tissues back. Pull out the first tissue—this will make it look like the tissues are "in use."

, This only works for a short while, and you have to take the candy out before you go to sleep. Keep the candy on the bottom of the pillow case—the side that is touching the mattress. If you put it in the top, the candy will make lumps, and give your secret away.
 Find a shirt that you never use, and hide the candy in it. Place the shirt neatly back in your drawer. It would be best to use a shirt that you don't wear often. For example, if it is summer, hide your candy in a winter shirt or a sweater. If it is winter, hide the candy in one of your summer shirts.


Another great hiding spot is inside of a pair of socks.
Coat pockets make great hiding places too!

, Push the box towards the back of the shelf, against the wall. This will keep the box out of sight.
 It would be best to use folders that you are currently using. That way, the folders will look like they are only being used for magazines.
 Candy and toys are both brightly-colored. If you have a bin where you keep lots of small, plastic toys, you can hide some small, brightly-colored candies in the bottom of that bin. The bright colors of your toys will help camouflage the bright colors of the candy.

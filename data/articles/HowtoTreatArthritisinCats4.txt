 The theory behind acupuncture is that specific regions of the body correspond to the function of a particular joint or organ. Inserting needles into these points is said to improve the function of the corresponding area.


Theories as to how this happen relate to the release of natural morphine-like substances, called endorphins, and stimulation of nerve impulses which inhibit the transmission of pain.
Some cats with arthritis do seem to benefit from weekly acupuncture sessions, and if they tolerate the needles, there are no adverse side effects to this therapy., Heat therapy is a useful tool in relieving the pain associated with arthritis. It involves the application of heat to the sore area, commonly in the form of microwaveable wheat bags.


The theory is that the heat dilates blood vessels which then carry away lactic acid and other metabolites that accumulate around an inflamed joint. The heat also relieves muscle spasms and helps the animal to relax.
A microwaveable wheat bag is ideal for this. Follow the directions on the bag's packaging and heat for the appropriate time. Then speak calmly to the cat, encourage her to lie down, and place the bag over the sore joint for five to ten minutes at a time.
Give the cat a heated mat to sleep on. She will really love the warmth and it helps reduce the chilling on her joints that leads to stiffness.
 An exciting option for the treatment of arthritis is stem cell therapy. This differs from previous generations of therapies in that the principle is to encourage repair of damaged tissue, rather than merely treating the discomfort.


This therapy involves harvesting fat from the cat's body, extracting stem cells from the sample, activating them in a laboratory, and then injecting the activated stem cells into the joints.
Success rates of over 95% of cases showing some form of improvement are hugely exciting.Many animals are so improved a few weeks after treatment that they no longer need to take pain medication.

 Before you go shopping, make a list of the items that are essential for your basic business wardrobe. As you put the item in your cart, cross it off the list. This will prevent you from getting carried away and spending money on things other than the necessities.A guideline to consider when shopping for business attire is the 70/30 rule. This rule suggests that 70% of the items you buy should be classic, versatile pieces, like your grey dress pants, navy blue blazer, and white blouses. The other 30% can be fun, bright, or trendy pieces. Sticking to this will help you ensure that most of your purchases will be multi-purpose and will not go out of style., You can find great, high-quality business attire for low prices at discount stores like Marshalls, TJ Maxx, Nordstrom Rack, or thrift stores. Check out these stores before heading to the more expensive department stores to see what items you can cross off your list for cheap., While saving money is always a joy, there are certain items, such as shoes, dress pants, and your suit, that you just shouldnâ€™t skimp on. Invest in a few high quality items, rather than a large amount of cheaper ones.

Good quality leather shoes, dress pants, and a wool suit can last you for many years if you take good care of them, which will save you money in the long run. The alternative is buying cheaply made items, and paying to replace them each time they break or wear out.

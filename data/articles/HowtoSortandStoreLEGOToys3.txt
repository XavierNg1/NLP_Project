 Depending on the size of your collection, you can opt for simple plastic drawer sets that only have a few drawers to more elaborate cabinets with many drawers that are usually used to hold crafting or hardware supplies.As with the plastic bins, storage cabinets that feature clear drawers are the best option because you can easily see what LEGO pieces are inside.
Look for drawer systems that provide different size drawers, so you can easily organize your collection based on the size of the pieces.
 In order to maximize your space, it may make sense to store multiple types of LEGO bricks and pieces in a single drawer. To prevent them from becoming mixed up, it helps to have a drawer organizer with different compartments, so you can separate the pieces based on your chosen sorting system.Drawer organizers are available at office and home supply stores. They come in a variety of sizes, and some are even customizable, so you can create the ideal storage for your LEGOs.
 Even if your storage cabinet has drawers made of clear plastic, it’s a good idea to label them with the contents, so you don’t have to go searching for a certain piece in the middle of a build. For the most organized collection, be as specific as possible when creating the labels.A label maker is obviously ideal for creating labels for your drawers, but you also easily create custom labels on your computer as well.

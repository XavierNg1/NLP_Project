 It’s vital that you feel comfortable with the person or company you are dealing with. After all they are going to have your company’s data in their hands. You need to trust your IT company as equally you need to trust your accountant. So does the person or company have a reputation, are they talking gibberish or making sense, do you feel they are trustable. These are some question to consider. But in most cases trust comes down to gut feeling.;
, It’s important to see whether the IT service company you are dealing with has the right level of skills for IT Support. You could ask how many years’ experience the IT Staff have or who are the IT service company’s existing customers and how long have they been with them. Also are the people working on your IT fully supported by senior staff and do they have access to helpful support resources that may save time if a serious IT problem occurs. For example Microsoft have professional support training and qualifications as well as technical forums and libraries of valuable troubleshooting information.
 There are very few IT companies in Thailand that are great at this.
 This may need to be considered early on the selection process.
 Cheapest may sound attractive but it may end up costing more later if jobs have not been done properly the first time due to unqualified personnel.
 A good IT company will keep various records of your IT environment to help with planning and support.
 Preventative maintenance (such as IT Outsourcing) involves routinely checking and updating your IT. If this is done properly the need for reactive maintenance decreases somewhat. Reactive maintenance is a case of only attending to a problem when something goes wrong.

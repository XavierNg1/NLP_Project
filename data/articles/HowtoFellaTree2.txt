 Look for dead branches, loose bark, cracks, or debris.
 Try hugging the tree and looking up to further assess.
Branch distribution
The height of the tree
Broken limbs in the canopy that can fall
The best place for a drop zone (should be free of people or anything that can be damaged)
Large branches from other trees touching or entangled with the tree you want to chop down. These will need to be removed from the adjacent tree.










Look for signs of root instability including: cow pie fungus, other uprooted trees, roots near a river or lake.

Clear a path at least 30 feet (9.1Â m) from the stump. Your exit should be at a 45 degree angle from the sides and back of the tree. Go behind another tree for protection, if possible.

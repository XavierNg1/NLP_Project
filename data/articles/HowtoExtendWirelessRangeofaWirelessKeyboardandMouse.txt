 If your wireless keyboard and mouse aren't performing well, radio-frequency range might not even be the issue. Check other possible problems before evaluating hardware and software options.


Batteries: Depleted batteries will make your wireless devices operate sluggishly.
Trackball mouse: Trackball mice get dirty after extended use, inhibiting performance. If you use a trackball mouse, flip it over and twist the locking ring to the open position. Take out the ball and clean the connectors. Replace the ball and lock it in place.;
, Other devices that use radio frequencies can interfere with your wireless mouse and keyboard. If possible, move appliances that have antennas, like televisions, AM/FM radios, baby monitors and cordless phones, to another area of your house. This can extend the range and signal strength of your wireless devices.
 Wireless devices transmit data to their receivers, which usually are docked in USB ports in the back of your PC's tower. If your mouse and keyboard aren't responding or are working intermittently, move the wireless receivers to ports in the front of the tower, if that provides a better line of sight between them.
 Even a slight adjustment of the tower position can have a positive effect on signal strength.
 You can attach a copper wire antenna directly to a receiver to extend its range. By running the antenna up a wall a few feet, you'll be able to use your wireless keyboard and mouse from more than 30 feet (9.1Â m) away.
 The newest versions of wireless mice and keyboards are highly functional and have superior range to previous generations. If none of the measures you take to extend the range of your wireless keyboard and mouse work, consider buying state-of-the-art devices.

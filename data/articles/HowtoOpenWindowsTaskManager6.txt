 Either use the ⊞ Win+X shortcut as described above and press C to access it, or get into it some other way through your Start menu. On older versions of Windows from Windows 7 to about Windows 95, this option used to be under the System Tools menu of the Applications set in the Programs list of computer tools pre-installed with Windows (if you haven't yet moved them around). Sometimes the ⇧ Shift+F10 option may work to open this, but in the mere case it doesn't, recognize that your Start Menu will be completely helpful.,

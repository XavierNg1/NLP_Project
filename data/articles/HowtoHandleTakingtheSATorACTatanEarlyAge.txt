 Being asked to take the SAT/ACT which is a very big honor, and you should be proud of yourself.;
, Don't think that just because you have to take the SAT/ACT, you have to study like crazy to get a good score. You are taking a test meant for people 4-6 years older than you. They have learned more, so you shouldn't try to compare yourself to them. This is just an opportunity to see how you do on an upper-level test.
 Some of these kits are not worth it. When you take the test again, your junior high scores will be deleted. If you really want to study, here are some links that might help you.

, High school juniors and seniors only have one or (in the case of juniors) two shots at it. You're in 7th grade, so you have 6 shots, so the test shouldn't be a huge deal for you.
 Don't spend ten minutes on a question, because there will probably be some that you don't know, especially on the math section.


If you answer a question incorrectly on the SAT, you lose points. The SAT is designed so that theoretically, guessing blindly will not increase and in certain test schemes might decrease your score. If you can eliminate at least two of the answers, you may wish to guess.
If you're taking the ACT, guess on every question you don't know. Don't leave any blank.
 As you can see, the averages of 7th graders on these two tests are not that high.

 This is a very basic client that will only handle whether or not the server had sent the other client’s info to the current client. Please note that unlike the server code, this code requires a server name. If you are running all of this on one computer, the server name should be the name of your PC. You can find out your computer name by right clicking on My Computer and going to properties.
 This should be in the same directory as the server code.
 Go to the start menu and in the search bar type in “cmd” and hit enter. Do this three times. The windows should look like this.
 You will have to type the exact path when using the command window. You will need to run the server code first on one command window and then the test client code on the other two. If everything was successful you will get something these messages in your window.

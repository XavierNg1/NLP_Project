 If your grill has become rusty or dirty, and food is sticking to it like superglue, cooking is no fun at all. The solution? It's time to re-season it. Start by giving it a thorough scrubbing with soapy water and a stiff-bristled brush.
 You want to make sure you get all the soapy residue off, and also check to make sure you got all the crusty bits cleaned as well. If not, repeat step 1.
 Pop it in the oven for a little bit until it's dry as last year's fruitcake.
 Follow the steps outlined in the Initial Seasoning section, and soon you'll be enjoying your grilling again.

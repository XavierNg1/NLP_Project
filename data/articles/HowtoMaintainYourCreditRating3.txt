 When you need a new line of credit, choose just a few lenders you think will approve you, and apply to as few of them as possible. That's because new applications for credit result in "hard pulls" of your credit report, and a number of them in a short amount of time makes it appear you are trying to amass a great deal of credit at once.
 If you are at risk of falling behind on a bill, contact your creditors as soon as you can. If you ignore them, not only will you sow distrust between yourself and the creditor, you greatly increase the chances of them reporting the missed payment to the credit reporting agencies.


You're also far more likely to be able to set up payment plans or modify the terms of a loan if you've been speaking with your creditors all along., It won't always work, but you can sometimes negotiate with a creditor to remove a negative item from your report. Counterintuitively, this works best when you still owe money to the creditor. Most creditors would rather get some money than no money, so there's an incentive for them to make a deal.Write your creditor and offer to pay a portion of the account if they will remove the item from your credit report (or at least mark it as “paid as agreed”). If they agree to your offer or you agree to their counteroffer, get the agreement in writing and uphold your end of the bargain.
If you're considering bankruptcy, let the creditor know. You'll almost certainly get a deal (sometimes at a steep discount) if you do, because many creditors get nothing at all after bankruptcy.

 At 10 or 11, they should, but good rules are:


No fighting
No swearing
Don't be rude
Don't answer back

,, If you are still going to spank, follow these guidelines:


Don't do it in anger, wait for the next day.
Don't do it bare. Their 'front - bottoms' will have started developing, and it will be embarrassing, humiliating and cruel. To some people this may seem the point of a spanking, but a spanking is to stop a child from doing something. See How to Give a Spanking for more information.
Don't do it to hard.
Don't use an implement. It is abusive and indeed illegal in some places.

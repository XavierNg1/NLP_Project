 Start cleaning from the top of the room and work your way down. Change or rinse cleaning cloths and brushes frequently. Rinse the area with clean water or a vinegar solution and wipe the area with a clean towel.
 Let the cleaning solution set for 15 minutes. Rinse the area with a damp towel or spray bottle. Dry it with an unsoiled cloth.

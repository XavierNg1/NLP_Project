 In the event that a tiger is tracking you or has begun to snarl at you and seems ready to attack, try to stay calm. Do not look the tiger in the eye, but do turn towards the tiger. Back away slowly while fighting the urge to turn your back and run.Keep walking backwards until the tiger is well out of sight, then turn and move quickly away from the location of the tiger.;
, Try to look and feel brave. Whatever you do, do not run. Running away from a tiger is all but inviting it to attack you. Inciting a chase can literally prompt an uncertain tiger into attacking. While slowly backing away, stand up as tall as possible.Make yourself look like less of a helpless prey animal by standing up straight.
Crouched down, you look weaker and smaller â€“ both of which will increase the chances that a tiger will attack.
 Even simple sounds may frighten a tiger off if they are not accustomed to the noise. Make noise with anything you have, especially if it makes a loud or unnatural sound.If you have a firearm, shoot it into the air.
If you have a signal flare, light it and hold it in front of you.
Jingle or shake any metal or glass items against one another.
If you attempt to shout at the tiger, do so with full confidence. Any nervousness that is betrayed by your voice may incite the tiger to attack.
 If the tiger begins to physically attack, it is unlikely to stop. Continue making as much noise as possible, and use whatever you have to shield yourself and strike back in self defense. Avoid playing dead; if the tiger is attacking out of an interest in eating you, it will simply proceed unencumbered. Remember that your best chance of survival is convincing the tiger to flee, which will require you to frighten or injure the tiger.If you are lucky enough to survive an attack, work to stop any bleeding and get medical attention as quickly as possible.

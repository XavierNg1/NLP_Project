 If you're just starting out, small metal objects work best. For more advanced practice, you might use unwashed clothing.
 Let your eye travel from one object to the next, staying conscious of the initial feelings or impressions you get from each.
 Take a few deep, cleansing breaths. Relax into a seated position and close your eyes.
 Turn it over and open your mind to the history it contains. If you see or hear anything, let your partner know.Repeat with all objects and check for verification later.


Try to identify the gender, age, and race of the owner.
Report your impressions with accuracy and ask your partner for verification.
Don't fret if you don't get any impressions. Not every object will inspire a vision.

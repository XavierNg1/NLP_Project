 Your detergent bottle should have a chart that tells what amount should be used for your wash load. When using a High Efficiency or front loading washing machine with soft water, use the minimum recommended amount of detergent into the washing machine. If you need to add bleach (which is used to whiten clothes), put it in appropriate dispenser. Always handle bleach carefully as it can cause harm to skin, eyes and clothing if it splashes.
 Colors are washed in cold water. Whites, under most circumstances, can be washed in warm water without problem. To kill mites, bed linens (especially pillow-cases) need hot water.


When in doubt, go with cold water, as hot water can shrink clothes.
 Add clothes to the washer but do not over stuff the washer as the clothes won't be cleaned well if there is too much laundry in it.
, Place your pile in the dryer. Make sure the lint tray is emptied, as a full tray can cause fires or make it impossible to dry the clothes. Tap tray gently upside down against garbage can to empty it.
, Iron items and hang on coat hangers immediately after drying to prevent wrinkles.

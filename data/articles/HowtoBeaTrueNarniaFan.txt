 The order in which the books were published is not the chronological order they should be read in. The chronological order begins with The Magician's Nephew. The sequel is The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, followed by The Horse and His Boy. The next book in the series is Prince Caspian, after that it is Voyage of the Dawn Treader, followed by The Silver Chair. The final book in the series is The Last Battle.;
, The movies star William Moseley as Peter Pevensie, Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie, Skandar Keynes as Edmund Pevensie and Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie. (And Ben Barnes as Caspian in the latter two.)

, Research them to find out as much as you can about them, and maybe you could even take on some of their characteristics, too.
 Anything to show your appreciation.
 Some websites sell mocks of the characters' armour, swords, shields and bows etc.
 Narnians always use their powers for good, not for evil. Keep that in mind.
, At the end of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, the Pevensies are crowned Kings and Queens of Narnia - Queen Lucy The Valiant, King Edmund The Just, Queen Susan The Gentle and King Peter The Magnificent. Think of an adjective that describes you, and secretly call yourself "King / Queen (your name) The (your chosen adjective)". And remember - "Once a King or Queen of Narnia... always a King or Queen of Narnia."

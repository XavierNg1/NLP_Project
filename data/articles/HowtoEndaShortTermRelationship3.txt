 Allow the break-up some time before you communicate with your ex again. Both you and your ex need time to heal and move on. Calls and texts immediately after a breakup can be confusing for both sides. Your ex also deserves the chance to move on. Moving on will be difficult for them if you continue to act as though you are not confident in your decision to end the relationship.If you ex calls you, politely say, “I need some space. Please do not contact me for now.”
Do not respond to any further communication. If they continue to contact you, ignore them rather than continue to engage with them and repeat your requests for them to stop.
 Stop commenting on their Facebook page or liking their Instagram post. If the temptation is too much to handle, consider unfollowing them for a while. You can always continue to follow them after you have both moved past the relationship.Unfollowing your ex from social media will help to curb jealousy that may occur as you each move on to the next relationship.
 Breakups, even from short-term relationships, can be difficult. You or your ex might feel guilty or lonely and could become vulnerable and possibly do something that you will regret in a face-to-face meet up. It is important to give yourself and your ex time to heal.


Spend time with your friends and keep busy, distracting yourself with plenty of activities. Breakups are hard no matter what, even if you are certain you want to end the relationship.

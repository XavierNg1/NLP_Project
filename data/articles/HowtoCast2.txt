 Put your index and middle finger ahead of the reel and your other two fingers behind it.


Unlike spincasting reels, spinning reels are designed to be reeled with the hand opposite the one used to cast with. As most fishermen cast right-handed, most spinning reels have the handle on the left. You can, of course, switch hands.
Spinning rods are also slightly longer on average than spincasting rods, with the guide nearest the reel seat somewhat larger than the other rod guides to permit the line to flow more freely when you cast.,,, The bail is a loop of wire on the rotating rim outside and behind the reel spool. It gathers the line when you reel in and deposits it on the spool. Opening it moves it out of the way of the line so you can cast your lure.
, To help you target your bait to the casting area, point your index finger at the place you want to release the line. You may find this technique difficult at first.


If you are casting with a long-handled spinning rod of the kind used in saltwater fishing, youâ€™ll want to use your reeling hand as a fulcrum from which to pivot the rod as you cast.
As with spincasting tackle, if you release the line too soon, your lure and line will fly upward. If you release too late, your lure will hit the water right in front of you.Some fishermen use closed-faced spinning reels, in which the reel spool is covered similar to a spincasting reel. On these reels, a trigger above the reel works similar to the button on a conventional spincast reel. Grip the line in your index finger and hold it against the trigger as you pull the trigger back. The rest of the casting technique is otherwise the same as using an open-faced spinning reel.

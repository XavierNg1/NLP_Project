 Explore the Sarepia Forest or Lost Temple of Zios to find a place you want to live in.


Sarepia Forest is a good place because there's lots of prey thriving! Sarepia Forest is a very popular place so you may need to consider it carefully if you prefer to hunt alone.
The Lost Temple of Zios is a great place too and very few wolves live and hunt there.
 If you're hunting, what you're hunting depends on whether you have a pack or not. Lone wolves can easily hunt small prey but it takes a whole pack to bring down deer.


The gray wolf is also known as the timber wolf.
Hunting in a pack is easier to get more prey and more prey means more power and energy. More power and energy means being a stronger wolf, and being a stronger wolf will give you respect from other wolves.

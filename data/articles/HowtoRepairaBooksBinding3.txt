 It’s harder to repair a hinge that’s still clinging to the book by threads, so removing it actually makes your life easier. Cut away any threads or loose paper so that the text block is even and clean., You can find this type of tape in most craft stores. Cut the tape so that it’s the same height as the text block. Don’t use the height of the cover for measuring the tape since the text block is usually shorter than the cover and you’ll end up with too much tape., It’s best to use a brush for this application since it lets you apply the adhesive evenly., Hold the tape by the dry tabs and line up the stitching with the edge of the text block. Stick one tab with adhesive to the first page of the text block and the other to the spine of the text block. Use a flat piece of plastic to rub the tape, ensuring that it sticks to the text block., This can take anywhere from a few hours to overnight. You should be able to tell if the adhesive is dry by running your finger over the top – you’ll be able to feel if there’s any wetness under the tape., You should lay it on top of the binder tape that is already glued to the text block and under the binder tape that hasn’t been glued yet., Then gently bring the cover up so the edge of the cover fits along the seam of the binder tape., This should be the tab sitting parallel to the spine, between the spine and the text block. When you pull the cover up, the spine should lay flat against this tab., Smooth it with a flat piece of plastic so that it lays flat against the cover. Close the book and run your flat plastic piece along the spine so that the tab sticks to the spine., The rubber bands will help all of the adhesive dry evenly and make sure that the tabs all lay flat against the spine and text block. Let it all dry overnight so that it doesn’t fall apart when you pick it up., Open your book carefully and flip through the pages so the book can adjust to the repair.

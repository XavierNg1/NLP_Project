 Combine the two ingredients in a large stockpot and bring them to a boil over high heat.


You can add the aromatic ingredients before the vinegar water reaches a boil, but boiling the water before you add these other ingredients can help keep the boiling point high, thereby making the water boil faster.
 Halve the lemon and squeeze the juice into the water before adding both halves to the water, as well. Also add the peppercorns, bay leaves, and salt.


Turn the heat down to medium and let the aromatics simmer for 10 minutes. Boiling these ingredients first will create a flavorful liquid for your octopus to cook in.
 Use tongs to dunk a whole, uncut octopus into the simmering water three times, letting it stay beneath the water for 5 seconds each time.


You could also wear thick rubber gloves and hold onto the octopus by the head with your hands as you scar it.
This method is best suited for a whole octopus. You will not be able to scar a cut-up octopus, since the purpose of this method is to cause the tentacles to curl up as they are rapidly dunked into the hot water.
 Drop it into the water and turn the temperature to medium-high, or until the water reaches a light boil. Let cook for 30 minutes, or until otherwise tender.


When tender enough to enjoy, the octopus should be tender enough to pierce with a fork.
 Let the octopus cool for a few minutes, just until it becomes cool enough to touch, and enjoy.


You could also cover the octopus and save it in the refrigerate up to 8 hours.

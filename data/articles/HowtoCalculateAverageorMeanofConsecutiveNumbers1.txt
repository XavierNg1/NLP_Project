 This is the number of numbers in the sequence. Determine whether the series has an odd or even number of terms.

For example, the sequence 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 has seven terms, an odd amount.

The sequence 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 has six terms, an even amount.
;
, This is the number that has the same amount of terms on either side of it. This middle number will be the average of the series.

For example, in the sequence 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, the middle number is 6. It has three numbers to the left of it, and three numbers to the right of it. So, in this series of numbers, 6 is both the mean and the median.
 To do this, find the pair of numbers that has the same amount of terms on either side of it. To find the average, add these two numbers together and divide by two. Their average will be the average of the series.For example, in the sequence 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, the middle pair is 5 and 6. It has two numbers to the left of it, and two numbers to the right of it. So, to calculate the average of the series, calculate the average of these two numbers:5+62=112=5.5{\displaystyle {\frac {5+6}{2}}={\frac {11}{2}}=5.5}So, in this series of numbers, 5.5 is both the mean and the median.

 Look for scratches in the paint or any other noticeable damages to the door and frame. Also check for grime or any sticky buildup that may just need to be cleaned. Close the door and run your eyes along the gap between the door and the frame, noting places where the gap is very thin.;
, This is very useful if you canâ€™t determine where the door is sticking by physically examining it. The paper should glide smoothly around most of the door. Wherever the piece of paper gets stuck is the problem area.

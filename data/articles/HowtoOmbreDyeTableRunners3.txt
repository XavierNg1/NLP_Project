 You only need two dye baths if you are using two colors. Make one bath for each color used, according to the instructions on the dye packet. Some color combinations that might work include:

Orange and pink
Green and blue
Purple and pink
Red and yellow

, Dampen the runner, and squeeze out extra water. Do not fold the runner as you would for a single color ombre effect. Instead, just roll it up from one end to the other. This will let you dye both sides of the table runner separately. The hem of the rolled table cloth should be visible on either side of the roll., Choose one color, and dip one end of the runner into the tablecloth, submerging it up to halfway up the table runner. Gently move the runner up and down the dye, but try not to get dye higher than the halfway mark. Rinse out excess dye.If you want a white strip in the middle, submerge the runner less than halfway up the runner. If you do not want a white strip, submerge the fabric up to the halfway mark.
 Once you have rinsed the first color, reroll the runner. Dip the other side into the dye and submerge the fabric until you have reached the desired color. Rinse out excess dye, and hang to dry.

If you want the two colors to blend together, dip the second color past the halfway mark.Test this first with a rag or scrap to make sure that that the dyes do not run brown when mixed together.

 Take a 40-minute walk daily or jog for half an hour. This helps to improve circulation, which allows for the distribution of nutrients in the body. This ensures that the skin gets the nutrients it needs to rejuvenate itself and stay healthy.
 Smoking increases the level of nicotine in the body and decreases the circulation of the blood. This results in less nutrients being absorbed by the skin and less toxins being released from the skin, causing reduced rejuvenation and growth of the skin.


Smoking also dehydrates the skin and depletes it of essential vitamins. This includes vitamins A, B complex, C and E, and minerals like potassium, calcium and zinc.
 Try to reduce your alcohol intake, or cut it out completely, if possible. Alcohol increases the level of toxins in the body, which has a negative effect on the skin and contributes to aging and thinning.
 Massage helps to improve the circulation of blood, allowing important nutrients to circulate throughout the body, nourishing and thickening the skin.


Apply a massage oil to the skin and massage the area for at least 90 seconds. This should be done twice daily for best results.
 Exposing your skin to sunlight can cause it to become thinner. Therefore you should wear long pants, long sleeved shirts and hats that have a broad rim in order to protect your skin from UV rays.


The ultraviolet rays of the sun break the collagen in the skin, causing it to lose its elasticity. This makes the skin thinner and causes it to bruise more easily.

 Use the finely pointed end of your comb to evenly part your bangs, making sure that the parted line of your bangs are straight. Comb your bangs forward. Tie or pin the hair that you are not trimming back.
 You can skip this step if the ends of your bangs fall alongside your dominant side. Twisting the bangs will allow you to easily cut your bangs if they fall opposite your dominant side. For example, if you are right handed and your bangs swoop across from the left side of your face, you will need to twist the bangs to face your right hand in order to comfortably trim them with your right hand. It is never a good idea to trim bangs with your non-dominant hand as you could make mistakes. Once they are twisted, comb out the section below the twist to work out any tangles., Beginning at the top (the shortest part of your bangs), cut the ends of the bangs at a 45 degree angle. Make very small cuts, and trim less than you think you need.
 To make the cut look less blunt and more natural, cut upward into the bangs, taking care not to cut too much off. You will only be taking a very small amount of hair off at this point. Part your bangs down the middle and cut one half first, then move to the other. When finished, brush them out and make small cuts into the bangs as one single piece.

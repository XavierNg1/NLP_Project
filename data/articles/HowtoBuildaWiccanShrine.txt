 You can use anything as the base for your shrine. A small end table or TV stand will work wonderfully. Whatever you decide to use, make sure you consecrate it and use it only for this purpose. This will be a holy shrine dedicated to the Wiccan God and Goddess.;
, There are many beautiful altar cloths that you can purchase from Wiccan supply stores. Some have symbols of the God and Goddess, others portray Celtic symbols. You may just want to use a plain color cloth or you can choose not to cover the shrine at all. This is strictly a matter of personal taste.
 This symbol can be anything from a white candle to symbolize the Goddess or a yellow candle to symbolize the God to an ornate statue to portray the Wiccan deities. Use something that is meaningful to you. If you live in a home with other non-Wiccans, you might not want to be so bold as to use blatant pagan symbols. In this case, a corresponding candle may be the best choice to represent the Wiccan God and Goddess.
 When you are ready to pray or give an offering, the incense can be lit to help promote a more spiritual state of mind or to consecrate an item before offering. The censer can be anything from a seashell to a bowl of sand or even an elaborate pagan censer if you wish.
 You can use anything you wish for this from a small saucer to a seashell or piece of pottery. Whatever you choose for this purpose, use it only for offerings. It will become a holy thing and shouldn't be used for other reasons if you can help it.
 Light the incense and sprinkle it with water and salt, while asking the elements and the God and Goddess to bless and consecrate the space. You can write your own words for the blessing, incorporate someone else's or just speak from your heart as you do it.

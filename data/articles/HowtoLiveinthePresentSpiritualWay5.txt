 Go deeper into the sensation.


You should notice the water touching your body is just a sensation, and the interpretation of it tells you if it is cold or not.
Similarly go deeper into negative emotions you feel in your body to dissolve them. It's cause negative emotions such as anxiety, despair, grief, etc, are no more than intense pressure, tautness, or discomfort you experience somewhere in your body and that doesn't make you unhappy. It's the mental interpretation of them that makes you unhappy. Situation is usually neutral, When a situation becomes tense, too serious, sad, anxious or fearful, and you feel down, then just smile. Its cause smiling tricks your mind to release feel good chemicals like dopamine. Its like transmuting and channeling the negative energy. Plus it helps you become more aware of sense perceptions.


Although its not an effective practice to always use a negative situation to smile or become present. Instead be aware as much as you can. Being aware doesn't mean not to think; it means even if you are thinking be there as the background witnessing presence. You are that presence.

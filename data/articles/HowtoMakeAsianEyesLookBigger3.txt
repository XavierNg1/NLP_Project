 Blepharoplasty is a permanent option for giving your eyes a rounder shape, or adding an additional eyelid fold for those with monolids. Consult with your plastic surgeon prior to surgery to get an idea of the nature of the procedure and whether such action can produce the looks you desire. Such surgery can also help remove sagging skin and bags under the eyes., Trimmed medium to thin eyebrows with a high arch are a common shape for drawing attention to the eyes, creating the illusion that they are much larger. Note that eyebrows frame your entire face, and altering the shape of your eyebrows may give your entire face a different appearance. Speak with a beautician before making any drastic changes to your eyebrows to understand how to rock the new look., Specially designed "circle" contacts are available that make the iris appear much larger, promoting a round, doe-eyed look.Black is a very popular color when it comes to choosing colored contacts as well, as it makes the pupil look much bigger, thus widening the eye. Speak to your optometrist before wearing contacts. Poorly made contacts or taking care of contacts incorrectly can damage the eye.
 Your hairstyle can change the way your whole face looks. Tell your hairdresser what you want specifically and ask for any recommendations and suggestions. You could also try changing to a hair color that contrasts with the color of your eyes, drawing greater attention to them.

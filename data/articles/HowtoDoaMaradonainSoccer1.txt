 Watch videos of the motion to get a feel for how the great soccer “trickster” Maradona used it. The Maradona turn is famous for its effectiveness in moving the soccer ball past a defender, especially in sticky situations. It’s a stylish spinning move that when done properly can be virtually impossible to defend against. Watch slow motion videos to acquaint yourself with the basic tactics of the move.;
, Approach the ball as if you were dribbling. Visualize a defender approaching as you attack their territory. Go through each motion of the move slowly and deliberately.
 The Maradona is all about stopping suddenly, then redirecting the ball in a different direction. The movements of the actual turn should be relatively slow compared to the pace of your dribbling down the field. Stop the ball with your foot on top of it and drag it back toward you.
 Take your foot off the ball and place it on the ground next to the ball, between the ball and and imaginary defender, turning your body so that the defender is on your side. Get your arm on that side up, to shield against the defender.
 Grab the ball with your non-dominant foot. As you spin, drag the ball into the space behind you. Keep the ball within your personal space, but far enough behind you that the defender won’t be able to reach it past your body.
 After you drag the ball behind you, spin and retake forward possession, dribbling the ball off in a angle down the field and past the defender. The key to using the Maradona turn in play is the dynamic speeds throughout. Imagine the whole move as approaching a defender fast, slowing and executing the turn, then bam! You’re sprinting past the confused defender as you continue down the field.

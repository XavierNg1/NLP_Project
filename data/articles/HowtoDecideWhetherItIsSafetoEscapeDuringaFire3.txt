 When family members are all on the second floor and you cannot use the stairway but the hall is clear, get all family members in the room that is easiest to escape from.
 If you can safely exit through it, do so using your escape ladder. Always send children down first.


If you do not have an escape ladder, pass the children down to safety first.
Adults and older children can lower themselves to arms length and drop.

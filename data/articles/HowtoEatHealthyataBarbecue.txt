 By eliminating bread from your burgers and hot dogs, you can cut the calories by about a quarter and you'll have more room for other foods. You can also cut up your hot dog into pieces and dip it in mustard or ketchup (whatever you prefer) like nuggets. For burger, you can also try eating it with just one bun on the bottom. Alternatively, choose whole grain bread.;
, No barbecue is complete without fruit. By piling half your plate with assorted fruit like watermelon, pineapple, grapes, strawberries, etc., you'll feel fuller longer and won't be craving those salty chips.
 No chips are good for you, but some are worse than others.
 Instead of eating potato salad, slathered in mayonnaise, choose a green salad.
 This is one of the most efficient ways to reduce your calorie intake at a barbecue. It can be hard though when everyone around you is drinking what they like. A lot of people like soda and would hate to trade it in for water, but drinking soda (yes, even diet soda) could ruin your whole healthy barbecue lunch. If you think water is too boring, try adding a lemon or lime slice to it to give it some zest.

 You don't have to buy expensive, 'fancy' clay, it is just recommended.
 You will need water too!, Now just 'knead' the clay in your hands., A pot? Go! You will need to make a hole in the middle that runs from the top to the bottom. A plate? Smooth it down onto the table but leave it a little bit thick., Make sure the clay is dry before picking it up again.

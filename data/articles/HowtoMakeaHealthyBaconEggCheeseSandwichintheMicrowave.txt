 To do so you will want to crack the egg and tilt the yolk from one side of the cracked shell to the other while holding it over a small bowl and allowing the egg white to fall into the bowl. Dispose of the yolk. Repeat this step so you have two egg whites.;
, Microwave on high for 30 seconds to 1 minute and 30 seconds depending on how you like your eggs cooked.
, Put 4 strips of the turkey bacon on top of the paper towel and cover with another paper towel.
 Microwave for 4 to 5 minutes. Check the crispness of the turkey bacon and make sure it is how you like it. If it is not crispy enough you can continue to microwave for 30 second increments until it is done to your satisfaction.
, and put the bacon on top. Place the other side of bread over the bacon.
 Enjoy!

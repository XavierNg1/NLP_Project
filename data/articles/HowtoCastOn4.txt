 It is best to use a smooth, light colored yarn. Keep making chains until you have the same number of stitches your pattern requires, then add at least six more chains.Here is how to make a crochet chain stitch:








Make a small circle with the yarn. The tail end should be on top of the ball end. Both ends should be facing in opposite directions.
Poke the a crochet needle through the circle and catch it onto the tail end.
Pull it through the circle partway so that you have a loop.
Take the hook out and poke it through the loop you just made. Gently tug on the tail end and ball end of the yarn, tightening the loop. The yarn should now be on your crochet needle.
Fold the ball end of the yarn over the hook and away from you.
Use the hook to pull the yarn through the slipknot. This will cause the slipknot to fall off the hook. This is one chain stitch. To make another, fold the yarn over the hook, towards yourself. Use the hook to pull it through the loop so that it is on the crochet needle.
 Be gentle with it so that it does not unravel. Once it's the length you need, cut it free of the working yarn. Take the end and pull it back through the last chain you worked to secure the chain and to keep it from unraveling. Take what's left of the tail and make a temporary slip knot — this is the end you will unravel to release your stitches.
 You will notice that one side of the chain looks like a row of V's. The other side looks like a chain with bumps. You will be sticking the needle into these bumps.
 You don't want the needle to be sticking all the way through the bump — stick it just far enough so that you can catch yarn with it.
 Be sure to leave a tail that is several inches long. Hold the yarn tight over the needle.
 The loop that ends up on your needle is your first stitch.
 Keep slipping the needle through the bumps in the chain, and pulling loops of yarn through.

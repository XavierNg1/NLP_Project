If the title already exists, you will be redirected to the article for the title. If so, try a new title, or change yours a bit to make it even less logical. After all, you are a person who can see the world from a very unique perspective.
If you get a search page with similar titles to the one you are searching you may prefer to edit one of these, rather than starting a new article. But duplicate articles are not a real problem at Illogicopedia so you don't have to. If you find that your exact title is not being used at all, then you have hit paydirt! At the top of the page you will see something like There is no page titled 'Have a ball'. You can create this page.. Click create this page and you should be presented with a blank editing box.
 The example article is worth looking at. You don't want to violate the Rules or the Policies on Content. Basically, the site is a clean site and does not want smut. (For that, go to Uncyclopedia or Encyclopedia Dramatica.)

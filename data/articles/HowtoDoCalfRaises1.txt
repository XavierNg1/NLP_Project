 Make sure the step is not very far up and close to the ground. You don't want to fall too far should you lose your balance.


If you're using a step-aerobics platform, you might want to slide two risers beneath the step.;
, Engage your core by pulling in your upper ribs and belly. Make sure that the balls of your feet are solidly planted on the edge of the step. Your heels should be over the edge.









If you feel unstable, or like you're losing your balance, practice this method with a wall or railing near by.
Place your hands on the wall or the railing.
 Distribute most of your weight onto the balls of your feet, and keep your legs straight.
 Then, begin to lower your heels, and move your weight away from the balls of your feet. Lower your heels until they're below the step, or platform.









You should be feeling your calf muscles stretch on the downward movement.
Repeat this sequence until you feel tired.

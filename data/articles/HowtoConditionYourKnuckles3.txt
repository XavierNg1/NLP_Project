 The bucket should be wider than your fist and deep enough to contain at least five inches of rice.
 Use a lot of force as you grip handfuls of rice, then release the rice back into the bucket. In addition, push your knuckles into the rice, and twist your hand to add additional pressure.
 Stop when you feel sore or if your skin breaks. Complete this exercise for a few minutes as part of your usual workout regimen, and use other knuckle conditioning methods in addition to punching rice for best results.


Some martial artists replace rice with harder, more coarse material, but now, this is considered unsafe.
Use rice unless you are training under the supervision of a professional trainer who recommends other materials.
 Repeat this for every finger. Remember, the more contact your hands make with the rice and the more pressure you put on your hands, the better your results will be. Take a break if you are experiencing excruciating pain or begin to bleed.
 Grab handfuls of the rice and squeeze. This will strengthen not only your knuckles, but your entire hand. Repeat the rice exercises as part of your regular workout.

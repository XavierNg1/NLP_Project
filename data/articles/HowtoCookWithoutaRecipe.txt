 Start cooking from recipes, eventually you develop your own tastes for what you think would go together well.Check your time available, good cooking takes time.;
, Also, sit down and read some good cookbooks. Some of the best are the Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook, the Pillsbury's Best is great, the New York Times Cookbook by Craig Claiborne. Another old standard is "The Joy of Cooking" and the food network chefs have all published cookbooks, too. You'd be surprised how much of a feel for cooking you can get just reading (and trying out) different recipes. Watch the Food Network on TV and watch their videos on their website (www.foodnetwork.com.) After a while, you know what you like and can experiment, and get a "feel" for what goes well together. But first you need cooking and baking basics.
 Do a little experimenting and season to taste. Don't be afraid to try. Some of the best dishes are made by accident.
,), and make sure you know the basics of cooking. For example if you know the science behind making a basic sauce, you can do all sorts of things to vary it. Recipes limit people, chances are if you think something will taste good, it will, or if you think it tastes good, then other people will too!

, Breakfast casseroles are always a hit. Try new herbs -n-veggies vs. salts -n-such.Start small and before you know it different ingredients will just fit.
 Or take a standard recipe and add to it.You will never make something same twice.Probably it gets close, but never the same.
 It'll take practice. Hopefully your critics will be gracious when you mess up, because you will probably mess up a couple of times.
 Some great combos are, sweet sauce/spicy seasoning, olive oil seared garlic with lemon zest, and BBQ sauce with brown sugar. Cooking is so much fun when you can be the creator.
 You have to love food! If you love food, you will be the sort who will seek out places to try new tastes and smells, and from there you will learn too.

 Try to find a happy medium between what would please your guests and what you can afford. Weigh the pros and cons of hiring a professional caterer, as it's not cheap, but it's one less thing you'll have to handle personally. Some couples choose to base the menu on the culture of the family, or go for something that most people like, such as Italian or Asian fusion.


Some people favor having a candy buffet as part of a wedding; this allows those with a sweet tooth to consume delicious sweets whenever they feel like.
At the same time as deciding on catering, make reservations for any additional rental/hire equipment needed, such as marquees, chairs, tables, dinnerware and flatware, linens, arches, etc.
Focus on this when there are at least 6 months left to go.
 Before settling on a cake it's best to have a tasting first. Also look into a cake that will match your theme, and please both the bride and groom. Sample cakes around eight months before the wedding and select the design at this time.


Check in on the baker again a few months prior to the wedding to be reassured that your order is still on the books and ready to go as planned.
It's best to have the cake delivered directly to the reception venue. Relying on a family member to do this places too much pressure on them and should it be dropped by anyone other than the responsible bakery, you have no recourse to a quick solution!

, This gives guests plenty of time to check your list and get the gifts.


Be realistic about gift pricing. Acknowledge the breadth of wealth by including very affordable through to more expensive items as part of the gift list. And also allow for non-gift list choices; some people really do not appreciate being forced to use one.

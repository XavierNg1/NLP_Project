 Use a mug that is microwave-safe and is suitable for drinking from. The handle should be in good shape and the mug must be large enough to make the brownie from. Make sure the mug is also a hard and sturdy glass.;
, In your mug mix the wet ingredients together with a metal spoon. Break the egg yolk by pushing and breaking the yolk gently. Then slowly add each dry ingredient to mixture and stir again until well combined.

Beating the egg yolk before adding it to the wet ingredients mixture will make your brownie light and fluffy.
 Place your mug in the microwave. Operate it to 1 minute and 40 seconds. While it bakes it should puff up and rise. Once fully cooked remove from microwave with oven mitts and place it on a safe place so no gets burned mistakenly. Have it cool for about 5 minutes.

To avoid spills while brownie is cooking, place a small dish or bowl beneath the mug. This helps catch any brownie mix leaking on the microwave floor.
To test if brownie is ready poke a toothpick in the middle of it. If it comes out dry it's ready.
 Scoop vanilla ice cream, sprinkle chocolate sprinkles, add chopped walnuts, spread marshmallow fluff, be creative! There are many topping decisions to choose from and they all go down to you for choosing.
 Serve and enjoy eating your brownie. You can either eat your brownie from the mug or remove it from there. Enjoy your sweet and delicious brownie!

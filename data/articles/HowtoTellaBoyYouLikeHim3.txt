 Intensity may scare him off. Keep your note light-hearted and playful:


Hi! :) I couldn't resist dropping you a note. Uh oh...I think Mrs. Umbridge is watching me! --All clear for now. Are you going to Sarah's party on Saturday? I like you -- wanna go together? :)"

, You can either put it in his locker (don't forget your name!), slip it in his book, or hand it to him directly. A quick, "I think you dropped this," will surely raise his eyebrow.
 Depending on his response, you will need to act a certain way.


If he responds positively, talk to him in person. You've got nothing to lose!
If he responds negatively, stay friendly. When you see him, smile. Continue as normal. Do not go out of your way to pursue him any further. The ball is in his court now.
If he doesn't respond, you may need to talk to him in person. If you didn't hand deliver the note, it's possible he didn't get it. Wait a few days. If he still hasn't responded, visit the conversation in person. He may just need time to think.

Instead Repair Disk Permissions with Disk Utility. Launch Disk Utilities from Applications > Utilities > Disk Utilities. Select your hard drive, click “Erase” and then “Erase Free Space”. You can pick which option you want, but the “Zero out deleted files” should be sufficient for most people., Viruses can slow down your computer and take up precious space on your hard drive. Another way to clear memory on your hard drive is to remove viruses.


On windows you can use the Microsoft Security Essentials program to scan and clean your computer, or download a virus scanner application like McAfee.While Macs are a little better at preventing viruses, they can still get them.

To make sure that you’re always up to date on security, open your System Preferences > App Store Preference pane > and check the “Automatically check for updates” and “Install system data files and security” boxes., Using a cloud drive is another viable option to clear memory on your computer hard drive. If you don’t have a lot of memory on your hard drive, but want to keep quick access to certain files, you can use online cloud drives like Google Docs, Dropbox, Box, and iCloud Drive.

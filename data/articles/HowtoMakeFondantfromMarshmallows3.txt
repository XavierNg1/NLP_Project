 Unwrap the ball from the plastic wrap and place it on a greased work surface. Use a greased rolling pin to roll it out in to a flat, thin disc that exceeds the size of the cake you want to use it to dress.









You can use cornstarch instead of shortening on your work surface to make sure the fondant doesn't stick.
Rolling it to a thickness of 1/16 an inch is a good bet for most cake recipes.
 Lift it using the rolling pin, then carefully transfer it to the cake so that the center of the fondant disc rests in the middle of the cake. Drape the edges of the disc over the sides of the cake. Gently press it around the cake so it stays in place with no bumps or wrinkles.









Don't stretch the fondant at this stage, or the cake will end up with wrinkles.
If the fondant rips while it's being transferred, you can smooth it out by gently pressing the ripped edges together.
 Use a knife to trim the fondant from around the base of the cake. Lift the trimmings away.

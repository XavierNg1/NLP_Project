 Find something that you can really get into. On the weekends you might want to do something active, like rock climbing, or taking dancing lessons. If sports aren't your thing, try something else- whatever you enjoy doing. It's important to find something that you enjoy doing because time passes by really quickly.;
, If you have a boyfriend or girlfriend or really close friend, it may make you less likely to want to leave. This will be a tough situation to deal with. On the other hand, a close relationship can distract your attention.
 Learn about its good things and what it has to offer, because when you leave, you'll appreciate your vacation a lot more, and you might learn a very valuable lesson from this.
 Hand in good quality assignments and homework and focus on your exams. If you focus hard on homework and tests, summer will come faster. Also, your parents will not be mad if you get A's all year.
 Find things that your vacation location has to offer that your home also does. For example, if you're going to Italy, and you want to have real pizza, don't go to that Pizza Hut, but go to a classic restaurant in your city. But don't do this excessively. If you do, you won't appreciate your vacation spot as much.
 This shows you that time is really passing by, fast. However, for some people, counting the days until summer arrives only makes time seem to slow down. Try forgetting about the future and get involved in the current activities. Before you know it, summer's here!

 You can sketch ideas to finish later as full drawings, or just doodle.;
, Realize that what you draw, what you create, is for you. If you want to draw stick figures, draw stick figures. If you want to draw a kitten, draw a kitten. If you want to fiddle with shapes and colors, do that. Your imagination is unlimited so don't stifle yourself just because what you are putting on a sheet isn't the "in" thing or isn't what people expect.
 Turn off your inner critic while you draw, or at least send him or her on a vacation for a while. Don't reject something before you even begin it.
 If your subject looks exactly as you intend, fine. If not, it is simply your interpretation of the subject.

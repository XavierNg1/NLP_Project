 An air-tight door though is not a very recent or novel concept, its importance has enhanced due to the changes in the environmental conditions. With growing noise and air pollution becoming a regular part of our daily life, an air-tight door can also reduce noise levels.
 As already stated above, an air-tight door can prevent dust and smoke from coming in, and can serve as an air trap. Some other uses are as follows:

Thermal insulation: Air-tight doors are ideal thermal insulators for any room because they do not let the outside prevailing temperature affect the inside temperature.
Water penetration: Using air-tight doors can stop water from entering, thereby preventing many common problems arising due to the penetration of water, such as mold, fungus, insects, etc.
Acoustic silencing: The peace usually needed for concentration and sleep can be marred by the growing amount of noise in the atmosphere, finding its way into our rooms even though the normal doors are shut. When the doors are air-tight, once the door is closed, nothing can hamper the peace and work can progress in a very silent manner.
Smoke and air resistant: Air-tight doors have the ability to resist smoke and air from outsides and help maintain freshness inside.


Use to keep air-conditioning constant inside, so use in rooms that receive the benefits of cooling or heating that is circulated; this will help to keep an even temperature maintained
Use for the study, for a work-from-home space, for bedrooms
Use to keep the noise of the games room or playroom from the rest of the house!

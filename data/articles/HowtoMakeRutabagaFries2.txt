 To ensure that the oven is ready to bake the fries, set the temperature to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully preheat. Next, line two large baking sheets with parchment paper so the fries won’t stick.If you prefer, you can line the baking sheets with silicone baking mats.
 The fries require one large rutabaga. Remove the skin with a vegetable peeler, and cut it into long, thin strips as you would with a potato French fries.Instead of one large rutabaga, you can use a couple of smaller ones.
You can cut the fries to any thickness that you like, but a ½-inch (13-mm) thick is the usual size.
 Place the rutabaga in a large bowl. Add 1 ½ tablespoons (22 ½ ml) of olive oil, 3 sprigs of fresh, chopped rosemary, 2 minced garlic cloves, ½ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of garlic powder, ¼ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of salt, and ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of freshly ground black pepper. Mix well so the fries are evenly coated with the seasonings.If you prefer a stronger garlic flavor, you can add more cloves of fresh garlic.
 Once all of the rutabaga fries are coated with the seasonings, arrange them on the lined baking sheets. Spread half of the fries on one of the sheets and the other half on the other sheet so all of the fries are in single layer.If you don’t have two baking sheets, you can bake the rutabaga fries in two batches.
 When the fries are on the baking sheets, place them in the oven. Allow the fries to bake for about 30 to 40 minutes or until they are crispy.Be sure to turn the fries every 10 minutes so they don’t burn.
 When the fries are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Sprinkle a little more salt over them if desired, and transfer to a plate to serve.The fries pair well with simple ketchup or creamy dipping sauces, such as a parmesan aioli.

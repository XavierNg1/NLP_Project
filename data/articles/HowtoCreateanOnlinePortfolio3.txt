 Pick between five and ten examples of your best work. Make sure you can confidently discuss the items in the portfolio if you’re asked about them during an interview. Create more than one portfolio if you have work in more than one field or if you want to demonstrate different work to different audiences.


For example, if you are seeking employment in both photography and writing, you might want to make separate portfolios that show your skills and background for each area.
 Label the work so it’s clear to your audience what they are looking at. Your examples should also showcase the skills and experience that you listed earlier on, so describe any skills or experience that you’re demonstrating through each sample of your work.


Keep your labels short and make sure the language is clear.
Make sure all of your files display clearly before making your portfolio live.
Give dates for your work.
 Select examples of your work that will make an impact. You need to immediately make an impression, because clients and employers are not going to spend more than a few minutes on your portfolio. Use backgrounds, fonts, and other web design elements that complement your work and make it stand out.

 You will need a good pair of rose gloves and a pair of sharpened bypass pruners.


Rose gloves need to be thick and tall to protect your hands and arms from any thorns growing on the bushes.
Bypass pruners cut like scissors do, making them preferable to anvil-type pruners, which have a tendency to crush the stems as they cut. Nice, clean cuts are essential to maintaining the health of the plant.
You should also make sure that the pruners are very sharp. Sharp pruners will make cleaner cuts than dull pruners.
If you do not have bypass pruners, you could use hedge clippers or trimmers, instead. Whatever you use, though, make sure that the tool can create sharp, clean cuts.
If cutting canes larger than 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) in diameter, use loppers instead of pruners.;
, Regardless of the purpose, time of year, or type of cut you are making, the cut should be made roughly 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) above the leaf bud at an outward angle.


The slant should be away from the bud.
Cutting any closer to the bud could shock it, but cutting any further from the bud will leave too much old stem, and the plant will be directing a lot of lost energy to stem that will no longer produce much.
 As you prune your roses, you should periodically dip them into a cleaning solution to sanitize them, thereby limiting the risk of spreading disease. This should be done regardless of how much you are pruning and during which season.


A common, all-purpose household cleaner is thought to work best.
Alternatively, a solution of 70% rubbing alcohol can be used, instead.

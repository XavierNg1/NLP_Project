Brush with an egg yolk, if desired. Resume cooking instructions.
 Start making parallel horizontal cuts about 1 1/2 inches (3.75 cm) from the filling and at 1 1/2 inch (3.75 cm) intervals down both sides. Leave a 1 1/2 inch (3.75 cm) uncut edge at the top and bottom for the ends.
 Starting at the top, start braiding the cut ends. Fold one strip over from the right side, then the left, and repeat, slightly overlapping a bit each time. Continue in this motion to create a braided effect, tucking in the last strips underneath the bottom, uncut edge.


Cover with a kitchen towel or cheesecloth and allow the stromboli to rise for 30 minutes. Resume cooking instructions.

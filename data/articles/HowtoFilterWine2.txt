 This system requires two people to operate. One person is needed to steady and pump, and the other person is needed to switch bottles. It works by pumping the system to push the wine through the tubing to the filtration system.This method is faster than using a gravity filtration system.
 The wine is forced through the filter pads. There are three different grades of filter pads.Coarse filter pad. A coarse pad adds polish to the wine without losing body or color.
Polish/medium filter pads. This is the type of pad used by winemakers. It adds polish to wine without removing too much body or color.
Sterile/fine pads. Use this pad last. 80% of yeast is removed with this pad. A fine pad also removes the effects of oxidation in your wine.
 Affix the outtake siphon tube to an empty bottle. Open the release on the barrel or storage unit.Make sure to sterilize your equipment before using.
Have one person operate the pump while another steadies the tube on the bottle, switching out bottles as necessary.
 As wine begins to get stopped up behind the pad, cease pumping and replace the pad with a new one., Apply the process of powder filtration by adding the powder to the wine in small doses. Continue to add powder in small amounts to the wine as you push it through the filtration system.


Powder filtration works by forming a cake along the filter pad with the filtration powder, allowing the pad to filter out very fine particles.
Replace your filtration pad constantly. Never reuse pads.
 Clean it with water and sulfite solution. Rinse once more with water.

 Roll out your dough and cut it into 6 even pieces, about 5 ounces each.Roll the pieces into 6 individual balls


Dust your workstation with flour to prevent dough from sticking.
 Roll your pieces into about 8-inch flat circles. If your dough is very warm, it may be difficult to handle, cool it in the refrigerator for about 5-10 minutes if necessary.
 Evenly divide your filling into about 3/4 cup per individual pie and scoop it onto half of each dough circle. Carefully fold the dough over to cover the filling and use your fingers or a fork to press the edges together.
 Use a sharp knife to cut a few slits into the top of your pies. This allows steam to escape when baking and helps to prevent the pie from cracking or bursting in the oven.


Brush the top of your pockets with egg or melted butter to keep the top moist.
 Bake your pies on a lightly oiled or non-stick baking sheet in the oven for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or until the crust is golden brown and flakey.


Enjoy with a side of ketchup.

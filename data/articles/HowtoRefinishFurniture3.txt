 Use a brush to apply an even coat of the wood stain you have chosen. Avoid overlapping brush strokes, since each brush of stain creates a darker hue.


You may want to test the stain on the underside of the furniture to practice using the right stroke and pressure to create the color you want.
Work with the grain so that stain doesn't build up in the crevices and make them look darker than the rest of the furniture.
Follow the directions for wiping off the stain with a soft cloth once it has soaked into the wood for a certain amount of time. Letting the stain stay on the wood for more time will create a darker stain.
 Use a brush to apply your chosen topcoat to the furniture, taking care to spread it evenly. When you're finished, let it dry completely.


Use an old cloth or t-shirt free of lint to further spread the topcoat and rub it evenly into the furniture.
Make sure you apply a very thin coat; a thicker coat could look murky, rather than shiny.
 Use a fine-grit sandpaper to sand the furniture evenly after the topcoat has dried. Spend the same amount of time sanding each section with the grain, so that all parts of the furniture look even. If desired, add another layer of topcoat, let it dry, and sand again. Repeat until your furniture's finish looks complete.
 Screw the knobs, hinges, pulls and other hardware back onto the completely dry and finished piece of furniture.

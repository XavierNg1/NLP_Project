 You will need an extension cord if your mailbox is far from your house.


Drape multi-colored lights or white lights around the mailbox at Christmas and Hanukkah time. Use red lights for Valentine's Day, orange lights for Halloween, green lights for St. Patrick's Day, and red, white and blue lights for Flag Day or Independence Day.
 A small wreath could hang around your mailbox, or you could add elements of a wreath, such as swags of pine, to the sides and top of the mailbox.


Wrap garland around the mailbox post for extra festivity and to complement your wreath.
Remember that wreaths are not just for Christmas. They are appropriate for Thanksgiving, Easter, and any other holiday.
 You could use Christmas bells, Easter eggs that ring, bells in the shape of hearts, or silver and blue bells for Hanukkah.
 You can find weather resistant decals that affix to the mailbox. These are simple, available for seasons and holidays and easy to put on and take off.
 You can buy a black cat for Halloween, an Easter basket or a large heart.
 This will provide some decoration without overdoing it on the part of the mailbox that gets the most traffic.

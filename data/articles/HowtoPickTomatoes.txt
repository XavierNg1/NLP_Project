Your climate will determine the best time to pick summer tomatoes from the garden.



 


Tomatoes are generally ready to pick 55-to-100 days after planting the seeds, depending on the variety.






Tomatoes can be harvested when they are still green and allowed to ripen off the vine.






Pick tomatoes from the vine before the first freeze.






Pick tomatoes often (every 1-to-2 days in some cases) during the peak growing season to prevent over-ripening on the vine.

Most ripe tomatoes are a bright red color, although tomatoes that ripen in hot weather may be yellowish-orange.






Different varieties of tomatoes will have different mature colors. Tomatoes can ripen to colors of red, orange, yellow, pink and purple. Check the bottoms of the tomatoes for the mature ripe color of the variety you are picking. This is where tomatoes begin to ripen first.






The skin of the tomato should be smooth and slightly shiny without any dark spots or bruises. Even a small spot can indicate that the tomato is rotten on the inside.


Tomatoes that are appropriately ripe should feel slightly firm when you lightly squeeze them. A hard tomato needs additional time to ripen.






If the tomato has soft spots, it usually means the soft areas will turn to bruises and the tomato may rot.
A tomato that is too soft all over is over-ripe and should be removed from the vine and discarded.


Lighter-weight tomatoes are not quite ripe.






Tomatoes that are heavy and dense are usually ripe and ready to pick and eat.



The tomato should smell sweet and earthy at the stem. A strong sweet smell indicates that the tomato will be more flavorful.

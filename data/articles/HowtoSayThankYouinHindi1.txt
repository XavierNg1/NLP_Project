 This is a common but formal way of saying "thank you." It's often used in situations where you really want to stress your gratitude (like if you've been given a gift). You may also want to use it with important business contacts, authority figures, and people who are older than you. This word is pronounced in three parts:Lay your tongue against the top of your mouth to pronounce "dha" with a soft d sound that's close to the English "dh" sound. Use the short u sound (as in "stuff"). It should sound close to the English word "the." This part is not said with an "ah" sound.
Next, say "nyuh." Again, don't use the "ah" sound.
Now, say "vod." Here, you will use the "ah" sound.
All together, it should sound a little like "dhun-yuh-vaad.";
, If you're especially grateful for something, you can use the superlative "bahut." This means essentially "very much" or "a lot" and is used a lot the way English speakers might use "very." This word is pronounced in two parts:


First, a short "buh" sound.
Next, a more forceful "hut" sound. Put the stress on this part — the whole thing should sound like "buh-HUT."
Say "dhanyavaad" after this to complete the phrase. See above for pronunciation help.
 This is another polite, formal way to say "thank you." The actual meaning in English is a little closer to "I am grateful." This word is pronounced in four parts:Say "obb." (rhymes with "rob"). This part isn't pronounced like the English word "ab."
Next, say "ha."
Then, say "ree." The r sound you want to use here is very similar to the Spanish r — it should sound almost like "dee" in English.
Finish with "hoon" (rhymes with "toon").
All together, it should sound like "obb-ha-dee hoon."

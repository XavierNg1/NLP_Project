 It is no secret to you that your school has a lot of rules. Whether you agree with them or not, they are still expected to be followed. Before doing something that could get you into trouble, think through the situation and decide if the risk is worth the consequences if you get caught., A common complaint amongst teachers is that students do not attempt to do their work. This leads to a defiant and ineffective classroom and a frustrated teacher. If you want to stay on the teacherâ€™s good side, complete all of your assignments on time and turn them in.For example, if you have a book report due, get it done on time (or early) instead of asking to turn it in late.
 All schools have policies in place. Common ones include things like tobacco bans, bans on weapons, dress codes, or attendance policies. These policies must be followed by each and every student. If you fail to follow these polices, you will get into trouble.For example, if you bring alcohol onto school grounds, you will certainly get in trouble.
 Conflict with other students can lead to trouble. Whether it escalates to a physical fight or simply causes class disruptions, these conflicts are not amusing for your teachers. If you make an effort to get along with your fellow students, you can avoid these conflicts entirely.

 It usually takes about two months from the time the seeds are planted for chamomile to produce flowers. This should occur by early to mid-summer, or about two weeks after you’re transplanted indoor seedlings., Your plants should continue blooming all summer long. As you snip off blooms with garden scissors, new ones should grow in their place. This will give you plenty of flowers to dry and enjoy all year round!Snip the flowers at the base of their individual stems. You can then trim the stems down to the base of the blooms for drying., Place the flowers on a plate and put them in a cabinet. This will allow them to dry fully. Wait until the plant crumbles easily to your touch, usually about 1-2 weeks later., Keep the dried flowers safe from moisture and sunlight, which could make them go bad. Mason jars work perfectly, and they’ll store easily in your pantry next to the tea., Using a tea ball, make chamomile tea! Put about a teaspoon (5.69 g) of dried chamomile into the tea ball. Let it steep for several minutes in hot water.You can make tea with fresh flowers as well, although dried blooms work better. Double the amount you use.
Add some honey to make this bitter-tasting tea sweeter.

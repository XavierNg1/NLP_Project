 To be eligible for unemployment benefits you must not only be unemployed, you must also be actively seeking suitable full-time work. This means searching for work with at least 2 different employers every week. You must submit a record of your work search at least once a month online at http://www.michigan.gov/uia or by mail, fax, or in person using form UIA 1583, available at https://www.michigan.gov/documents/uia/1583_268058_7.pdf. Your records should include:The name of the employers where work was sought, or the name of the search engine or employment agency used.
The online or physical location of the employers.
The dates on which work was sought.
The method used to seek work with each employer.
 If you have received unemployment benefits within the last year and a half, then to be eligible for a renewal of benefits:You must have worked after your prior benefit year began.
Over the course of this work, you must have been paid at least five times the last weekly benefit amount that was in effect.
 Qualifying wages typically come from the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters prior to when you filed your claim. If you cannot qualify based on this standard base period, the UIA will use your wages in the four most recently completed quarters as an alternate base period.For example, if you filed for benefits on October 15, 2015, the five most recently completed quarters would be: July – September 2015; April – June 2015; January – March 2015; October – December 2014; and July – September 2014.
The standard base period in this example includes: April – June 2015; January – March 2015; October – December 2014; and July – September 2015.
The alternate base period includes: July – September 2015; April – June 2015; January – March 2015; and October – December 2014.
 In order to qualify for unemployment benefits, you must have earned certain minimum amounts.You must have wages in at least two quarters of your base period.
In one quarter your gross wages from all employers must be at least $2,871.
Total wages for the four quarters of the base period must equal at least one and a half times the highest amount of wages paid in any quarter.
For example, using the base periods in the previous step, if you earned $3000 in the January – March 2015 quarter, you would need to have earned $3000 x 1.5 = $4500 over the course of all four quarters combined.
If you do not qualify using the standard base period, try the alternate base period. If you still do not qualify, try the Alternate Earnings Qualifier.
 If you earned a large wage in one quarter and significantly smaller wages in the other quarters, so that your total earnings are not 1.5 times your high quarter wage, you may still qualify under the Alternate Earnings Qualifier.You must have wages in at least two quarters.
Total wages for all four quarters must be at least 20 times the state average weekly wage (SAWW). For 2015, the AEQ amount is $18,214.20 . You can find the SAWW chart for all years at https://www.michigan.gov/documents/wca/wca_averge-weekly-wage_chart_477569_7.pdf.
For example, if you earned wages in only two quarters – $12,900 in one and $5,500 in another – you would not be eligible under the regular qualifying method, because $12,900 x 1.5 = $19,350, and $12,900 + $5,500 = $18,400, which is smaller than $19,350.
However, in this example you would be still be eligible for benefits, because $18,400 is larger than $18,214.20, the minimum amount required to qualify under the AEQ.
Remember: if you don’t qualify under the AEQ during the standard base period, see if you qualify during the alternate base period.

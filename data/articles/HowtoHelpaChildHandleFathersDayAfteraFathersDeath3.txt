 Expecting a child to cope calmly with the loss of their father is unreasonable. You should be prepared to talk to them and help them control their emotions, especially on a holiday as specific as Father’s Day. Having the day planned out will help you predict when the child might have the most intense emotions.For example, you might be met with resistance or outbursts over what to eat for dinner. Instead of making this a big deal, try to help the child understand their anger.
 The child will feel better knowing that their father has not been forgotten. Allow them the space to memorialize their father in some way, and make an effort to do the same. Be sure that they actually see you giving their father recognition of Father’s Day. Some ideas might be:Plant a tree in his memory.
Do charity work in his memory.
Talk to him in some way.
Do activities that he would enjoy.
 Teaching children to grieve is important. Teaching them to come to terms with that grief is also important. Plan a fun event for the end of the day to lighten the mood after Father’s Day. Explain to them that it is okay to feel sad and that it was good to recognize their father, but now it is okay to let go of the sadness for a while and have fun.You could plan a trip to the park or the zoo in the evening.

 Take a medium size carrot, and remove the skin using a vegetable peeler. With a sharp knife, trim off the ends of the carrot to get the thickness as close to uniform along the entire length as you can., Instead of using a knife to cut out notches, drag a citrus zester along the entire length of the carrot. The notches won’t be as deep as they would be with a knife, so the flowers will have a delicate, frilly look when they’re finished.For this method, you can’t use a grater or microplane style zester. You need a traditional zester that features a series of sharp holes at the end of a handle.
 After you’ve run the zester along the entire length of the carrot, use a sharp knife to slice it into coins. You can make the coins as thick or thin as you like, and each will have the notches to create the subtle flower shape.

 It's as simple as that, in order to get better results, you'll need to train. 3-4 times a week is perfect, anything less and you won't be improving fast enough for results to be noticeable, too much and you could risk over training and 'burning out';
, If there are no tracks close by, a sports oval is good. Do not run in large areas that are over 1 kilometer (0.62Â mi) long. Having a short (400m) track makes it easy to keep track of your progress.
 Do not start this plan unless you already have some sort of fitness.
 Run various distances ranging from 800m - 5 k. Write down your times and also your lap times. By keeping track of your lap times, you can see how well you run the distance and if you go out too hard or not hard enough etc.
 Without goals, your running will feel futile and pointless.
 That means shorter distance at or close to race pace. e.g. if your pr (personal record) for 1500m is 5:30 and you want to drop down to 5:00, you should run say 6x300m with each 300m in one minute (which happens to be the pace you need in order to run 5 minutes) with, say, a 45 second rest in between each 300m. As you get fitter and it becomes easier, reduce the rest until you can run the complete 1500m in the time desired. Do this for whatever distance is required and make up your own plan.
 Runs lasting 45 minutes to 1 hour should be done twice every three weeks. This will ensure your legs can stay the distance in any event.
 Results should appear within weeks and after a few months; your fitness should be through the roof.

 Depending on what recipe you use, always check the shelf life of the ingredients that you choose. Store leftover salad in a sealed airtight container in the refrigerator. On their own, expect sweet potatoes to last two to three months in the fridge, but always go by whichever ingredient has the shortest shelf life.The dressing may cause the salad to spoil quicker. If you know you won't be eating the whole batch, split the dry salad into portions before adding dressing. Only add dressing to the portion that will be eaten immediately. Store the rest separately and toss when ready.
 Be aware that there is some debate about whether it’s sweet potatoes are safe to eat raw.

However, keep in mind that research on the subject suggests that regular, frequent consumption can have ill effects, so don’t make it a daily habit. Limit your intake to every once in a while.Avoid them entirely if you suffer from kidney stones, since raw sweet potatoes can make your condition worse.

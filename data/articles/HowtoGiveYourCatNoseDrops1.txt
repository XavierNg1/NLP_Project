 If you are right handed, use your left hand and make a "C" shape with your thumb and forefinger. Place the thumb under the cat's jaw, and the forefinger on her forehead. The cat's head should now be held in your hand. Grip the head gently and twist your wrist so that the nose is rotated upward to point towards the ceiling., If you are right handed, pick up the bottle of drops in your right hand. You should already have removed the lid in preparation.


If you have not already removed the lid of the bottle, let go of the cat's head, remove the lid and start again.
 Holding the dropper bottle between your finger and thumb, invert the bottle such that the dropper is pointing towards the floor. Give the bottle a gentle squeeze until a drop of liquid appears at the end of the nozzle. Maintain this pressure and position the dropper nipple as close to the cat's nostril as possible.


Once you are happy with the position of the bottle, squeeze the bottle until the required number of drops are dispensed into the cat's nostril.
 The exact distance of the dropper nipple is not crucial, but the closer you are to the nose the more likely it is that the drop will go into the nostril. In an ideal world, you should touch the nipple to the nostril, but some cats will flinch away when they feel the bottle’s touch, which will make you lose the positioning of your bottle.


Try to hold the bottle so that it hovers about two to three millimeters above the entrance to your cat’s nostril so that the drop is most likely to go in.

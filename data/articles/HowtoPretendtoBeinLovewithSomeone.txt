 Also, try to pick somebody that you won't have too much trouble pretending to love.;
, Think of what good characteristics they have in them- are they funny? Smart? Caring? This is helped a lot by Step #1- you can 'choose your attributes'. But if you can't choose your person, and you dislike that person, try to be a little more accepting of his/her ways. It'll be a lot easier if you can start off with a relatively good relationship with your 'love'.
 Whether you're trying to convince the subject of your affections or someone else, you'll be expected to seem in a better mood when he/she is around.
 When people have crushes on other people, they tend to be louder to try to get the attention of their crush. You'll want to imitate this. Talk louder, laugh louder, smile more, move a bit more when you're talking to other people. Make this change obvious to any looker-on.
 Think about how you'd act with someone you loved. Go on dates, put time out for him/her, and enjoy yourself. Even if you aren't interested in the person romantically, you can still be friends. It'll make it seem much more realistic.
 Do not go on pretending to be in love with someone- ever. If you need help with this, see wikiHow's "How to Break Up With Someone You Love".

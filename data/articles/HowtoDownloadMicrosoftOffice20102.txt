 Office is available on a variety of torrent sites, though this method may have questionable legality.
 Always check downloaded software for viruses, as non-traditional methods are ripe for abuse by hackers. Read the comments on the torrent site to see if anyone else encountered problems.
 In order to install Office 2010, you will need to enter a valid product key. Some downloads will come with a text file containing keys that you can use, while others will have a key generation program that will create a unique key for you to use.


Be very wary with key generators, as they can easily install viruses without you knowing.
 Once you have found a valid key, the rest of the installation will proceed normally. If you have a cracked version installed, you may not be able to access updates for Office from Microsoft.

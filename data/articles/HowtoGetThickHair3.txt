 There are products made for both men and women that are found to be effective by many people.


Some of the products are hair growth-stimulating shampoos, and others have a more complicated application process that requires you to sit with the product on your head and allow it to work. Do some research to figure out which is right for your needs.
Test the product on one discreet part of your head before applying it to your entire scalp, since you may have an allergy.
 Extensions are attached to your existing strands of hair in such a way that they blend in with your natural texture and color. They can be as long or short as you want.


Extensions can be expensive, so conduct some research before you choose what type to get.
Visit a stylist to ask for information about extensions and have them placed in your hair.
 Coloured sprays and creams can be used to colour the scalp and give the appearance of thicker hair. Another option is Nanogen, tiny keratin fibres which bind to your hair making it thicker, but wash off easily. These are a more flexible solution that transplants.
 Commonly called hair plugs, hair transplants are surgically inserted in spots where hair is balding or thinning.


This method is usually pursued by men, but women with thinning hair may also get hair transplants.
Hair transplants are done in a doctor's office. Consult your doctor or ask for a referral to get further information about whether you are a good candidate for this procedure.

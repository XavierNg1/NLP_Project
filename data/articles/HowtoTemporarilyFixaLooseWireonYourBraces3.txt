 Braces wires can be very easy to cut. You won’t need anything very large. Choose a pair of wire cutters that can fit comfortably inside your mouth.Distal end wire cutters are best, since they will grip the cut piece of wire. This helps avoid the possibility of you swallowing part of the wire.
If you don’t have wire cutters handy you may be able to use nail clippers.
 Anything you put in your mouth should always be clean. Wipe the wire cutters down with rubbing alcohol before putting them into your mouth. You should also sterilize nail clippers if using those.Let the alcohol dry or evaporate before inserting the wire cutters into your mouth.
Use the wire cutters soon after cleaning them. If they lie around for a long time, they may be exposed to bacteria.
 This helps prevent the clipped part of the wire from flying into the back of your throat. You want to avoid swallowing the wire at all costs. Swallowing the wire can be painful and sometimes dangerous., It may be difficult to see and cut the wire by yourself. If there’s any chance you won’t be able to do the job neatly and without hurting yourself, ask a friend or family member for help.Avoid shaking the wire too hard or pushing with pressure on the back teeth while trying to cut the wire, as you can detach any of the brackets.
You can try looking in the mirror under a bright light. Not all wires will be visible or easily accessible to you.

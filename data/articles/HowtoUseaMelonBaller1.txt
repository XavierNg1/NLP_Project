 Scrub the whole melon with a clean brush under cool, running water. If you skip this step, bacteria on the rind can easily contaminate the melon flesh during slicing. Wash the knife and melon baller in hot, soapy water.Don't wash the melon until you're ready to cut it, as a wet rind may encourage mold.Avoid soap and detergent, which may penetrate to the flesh.Produce washes are harmless, but unnecessary.;
, Leaving it in two halves provides a bowl to catch the juice. That said, it's not a big deal if you've already cut it into quarters or slices. If your melon has a center full of seed pulp, scoop this out with a large spoon and discard it.
 Hold the scoop flat against the melon, or at a slight angle. Press down into the melon until the entire scoop has sunk into the flesh. If a portion of the scoop is above the melon level, you'll end up with irregular chunks instead of spheres.
 Turn the melon baller 180ยบ, until the scoop is facing you. There should be a perfect ball of melon sitting in the scoop.


If your melon balls still aren't satisfactory, rotate two full rotations before you remove the scoop.If you're using a baller with a plastic scoop or handle, don't apply too much force. These may break if used on dense fruits.
 Many melon ballers come with a different size scoop on each end of the handle. Try round, metal measuring spoons instead if you want to make balls of additional sizes.Plastic measuring spoons may work on soft fruit such as watermelon.

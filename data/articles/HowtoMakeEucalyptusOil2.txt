 One jar will be used for making the eucalyptus oil in, and the other for storing it. You can use pint jars, quart jars, or larger jars, depending on how much eucalyptus oil you intend to make.Make sure your jars are clean and dry, as any water or moisture can result in mold.
The jar you use for making the oil can be clear or dark glass. A dark glass jar is best for storing the eucalyptus oil.
 You will use the same proportion of leaves to oil as you did in the crock pot method - about 4 parts oil to 1 part eucalyptus leaves. Use 1/4 cup of eucalyptus leaves for every cup of oil.


Place the eucalyptus leaves in the jar, followed by a thin layer of sea salt.The salt will help to extract the oil from the leaves.
With the handle part of a long spoon, smash the eucalyptus leaves into the bottom of the jar, releasing their natural oils.
 Allow to steep for at least 2 weeks in the warm sunshine. The longer you allow the mixture to steep, the stronger it will be.


Make sure your jar is tightly sealed, and give it a good shake to stir the leaves together with the oil. Continue to shake the jar every 12 hours or so until the steeping is finished.
The spot where you keep your mixture while it's steeping should receive 8-12 hours of direct sunshine per day for maximum benefit. Keep it in an area that's not hidden from site, so that you don't forget to shake it.



The strainer will catch the leaves, which you can discard.
Wipe down any excess oil from your storage jar with a damp cloth.
 You can be as creative as you like in designing labels for your homemade essential oils, but you'll definitely want to identify it by type (Eucalyptus Oil) and by the date it was completed.


The oil will be good for approximately 6 months from the time you make it.If you've included other herbs to your eucalyptus oil, include this on the label. Some popular additions are: Sage, Lavender, Spearmint, or Rosemary.
To store oil for a longer time, keep in the refrigerator.

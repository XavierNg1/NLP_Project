, If you suffer from regular voice cracks, it's common to soothe your throat with warm water-based beverages. While milk and other cloying liquids can coat the throat, making it more difficult to speak clearly, teas, coffee, and other hot beverages are all recommended.


One of the most common home remedies is some hot herbal tea, mixed with about a teaspoon of lemon juice and honey. Chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, and licorice root teas are all soothing to the throat.
Don't drink scalding hot tea, which can burn your throat and make it more difficult to speak comfortably. Drink it warm.

Spicy foods like chili peppers, curries, and salsas
Oily foods like buttery biscuits, cookies, or other desserts
Fried foods like French fries, fried fish or chicken

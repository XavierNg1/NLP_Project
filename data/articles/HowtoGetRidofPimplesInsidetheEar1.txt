 Before touching the pimple, make sure that you wash your hands one to two times. Touching pimples with unclean hands can cause the pimples to get worse, since dirt and oil may further block your pores., One way to start healing the pimple is to wipe it with an alcohol pad. This also helps keep it from getting infected and stops the spread of any infection., Witch hazel is another disinfectant that can help clear up and prevent ear pimples. Wipe the ear area with a cotton ball or swab coated in witch hazel., Wash the area with the pimple with water as warm as you can stand it. Also use natural soap or an oil-free cleanser. This cleanser should contain Salicylic Acid, which helps unclog pores and heal pimples. For inside the ear, use a warm or hot washcloth or Q-tip to wash and massage the pimple. Don't rub the pimple; that can cause further irritation.Be very careful when using the Q-tip â€” do not insert it into your ear canal. Only use it to swab the outside of your ear.
 To help reduce the pimple, apply acne cream that includes two to 10% Benzoyl Peroxide. Let the cream dry on the pimple.You can also apply 10% Glycolic Acid cream.
 Try placing some Neosporin or other ointment cream or gel to help heal the pimple. Let the gel dry., Soak a cotton ball in hydrogen peroxide and spread it on the pimple. If the pimple is inside the ear canal, you can pour peroxide into the ear. Drain the peroxide into a bowl or onto a cotton swab.
 Pimples in the ear are just like any other pimple. Ear pimples tend to be caused by a buildup of dirt, shampoo, and earwax. The key is to leave them alone and they will heal.


Don't try to pop them, even if this is what you normally do with pimples. Aural pimples (pimples on the ear) are not only painful when squeezed, but if they are on the fleshy lobe of the ear or inside the ear, they can bleed for some time afterwards and cause more problems.

 The sooner you start treating the stain, the better your chances of removing the stain will be. Do not hold off on treating the stain or do part of the process and then put it aside. Treat the stain completely as soon as you notice it., Some stain removers may lead to discoloration of fabrics and other surfaces, so it is best to test an area of the fabric or surface that people will not notice.For example, you might test the inside of the leg of a pair of jeans, the back of a sofa, or an area of hardwood flooring that is always covered by an area rug.
 Using heat may set the stain, so avoid exposing the stain to heat. Do not use a hair dryer, clothing dryer, or iron to treat the stain.

 This application allows you to view pictures, re-size them, and other functions. If it is not in your dock, click the magnifying glass symbol in the top right corner of your screen and type in "preview". It should show up in "Applications" or "Top Hits". Click the word "Preview". Go to "Tools" and click on "Show Colors". This will make a new window show up. This window is an important part of the guide, so don't close it.;
, Go to Wikipedia and type in "list of crayola crayon colors" into the search box and hit Enter. Scroll down to the list of standard colors. Click the Preview icon, which will now be on your dock if it was not already there. That will make the color window show up again. Click on the Color List icon, which is third from the left. Make a new color list, and call it "Crayola Colors".
 Then mouse over the first color on the list, and drag the color sample from the window to the list. Do the same with the second color, and so on until you're done. You can give them their real names later on if you'd like.
 Now you have all the Crayola colors on your Mac! If you want to put them to use, there are loads of drawing programs to download for your Mac, like Paintbrush!

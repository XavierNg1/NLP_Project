 Putty knives are short, flat tools made of metal or plastic. If the paint is still fresh, you should be able to remove a good chunk of it with a putty knife. Make sure not to scrub the paint, as this could stain the carpet. Bring the putty knife under the paint and push it away from the carpet.You should have a container next to you where you can dump the paint you scrape up.
 Again, you don’t want to rub or scrub the paint; this will only drive it deeper into the carpet fibers. Blot as much of the paint as you can, until you feel the cloth isn’t removing any more paint.


It’s important to use a white cloth; a colored cloth might transfer its dyes onto your carpet, making a bigger mess., Turpentine will help separate the paint from the carpet fibers. This will allow you to remove more paint without scrubbing. You should be able to remove the majority, if not all of the paint., While blotting the paint with turpentine might remove the actual paint, you might need to clean the carpet fibers of some discoloration. Mix a tablespoon (15ml) of dishwashing detergent with two cups (473ml) of cold water. Dip a clean white cloth into this solution and sponge the area where you spilled the paint. Sponge until the area is clean.


After cleaning, use a paper towel to absorb any leftover solution.

 You can also use minutes followed by decimal points to identify latitude and longitude. However, you must again start by identifying the broad lines of latitude and longitude. Figure out where the lines of latitude and longitude meet to pinpoint your location.For example, say your location falls at 15째N, 30째W.
 Some maps identify minutes followed by decimal points rather than minutes followed by seconds. An online map should be able to provide you with the minutes broken down into decimals for each line of latitude and longitude. For example, a line of latitude may be found at 23.0256 minutes., When using the degrees and decimal minutes system, you do not use directions like north, south, east, and west. Instead, you use positive and negative numbers to determine where locations fall on a map.Remember, lines of latitude fall north or south of the equator. When using decimals to indicate latitude and longitude, positive numbers fall north of the equator and negative numbers fall south of the equator. The number 23.456 falls north of the equator, while the number -23.456 falls south.
Lines of longitude fall east or west of the Prime Meridian. Positive numbers fall east of the Prime Meridian, while negative numbers fall west. For example, the number 10.234 falls east of the Prime Meridian while the number -10.234 falls west of the Prime Meridian.
 To write out the full location, start with the line of latitude. Follow this with the coordinates using minutes and decimals. Add a comma and then the line of latitude followed by its minutes and decimals. Remember to use positive and negative numbers to indicate the direction of coordinates. You do not use the degree symbol with this format.For example, a line falls 15째N, 30째W. Identify the number of minutes and decimals and then write out the coordinates.
The above example could be written as, "15 10.234, 30 -23.456."

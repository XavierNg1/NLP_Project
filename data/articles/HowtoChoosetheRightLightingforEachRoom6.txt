 Whether your goal is to enhance the beauty of your home, or provide additional security, you have numerous lighting options to light up your home's exterior. Extend the hours you can spend outside, or create a festive environment!

, The selection of lighting fixtures is of two primary types: decorative and functional., The design of these fixtures should complement the look and feel of your house and landscape while providing sufficient lighting for safety, security, and functionality.


When installing a wall lantern, size the fixture to the door and surrounding space. Wall lanterns should be mounted slightly above eye level at about 60" to 66" from the center of the fixture to the floor. Post-top lanterns can be selected to match the style of the wall lanterns. Large post top lanterns make a better impression when used in large open space.
 They spill light in all directions and can be a cause of light trespass (onto others' properties) and distracting glare for drivers. Many lighting designers forgo lantern style lights entirely and instead use lights with hoods (that shield the glare) and lights that are positioned within plant material so they are hidden completely.
 They are strategically positioned around the property to selectively illuminate plant material and architecture. A skilled lighting designer positions fixtures so only the effect of the illumination is seen, not the lighting fixtures themselves.
 Add landscape lighting, deck lighting, and step lighting to not only bring out the beauty of the home at night, but also add extra security and safety.

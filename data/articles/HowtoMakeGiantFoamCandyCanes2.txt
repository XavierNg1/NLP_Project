 Using a sheet of plywood and a garbage can lid (anything round will work), trace a half circle to create an arch.
 To keep the PVC from wiggling around when bending, create a channel by placing small pieces of scrap wood along the outline. These should be placed about 4-5 inches apart on either side of the line you’ve drawn. It’s best to drill these in place so they don’t shift.
 Place your template on the ground and grab your ½ inch PVC. Measure the noodle into three equal parts. Using a hairdryer, begin to slide the PVC through the channel, heating it along the way so it’s bendable. Only bend the top third of the noodle.


If you want to save time, simply eyeball the appropriate bend spot and bend according to your preference.
Be careful not to hold the heat source at the same spot for too long as it could melt.
This will take several minutes so take your time.
Wait until it’s cooled before popping it out of the template.
 Depending on the size of your PVC pipe, you may need two noodles.
 Cover the seam where the two noodles meet (if applicable) first. Otherwise, go ahead and cover the entire cane with white duct tape.


Due to the curves and noodle material, the tape may not lay perfectly flat.
 Diagonally, wind the red tape around the noodle. You can further customize the decoration with glitter, bows, etc.


If you’d like your stripes to be extra precise, measure two to three inches for each stripe (or larger if you prefer giant stripes). Make a small mark with a pencil. When winding the tape around the noodle, let the marks serve as a guide along the way. This will keep your stripes even and a consistent size.

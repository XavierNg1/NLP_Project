 Backpacking is the ultimate form of camping in the wilderness. It allows you and your group to carry everything you need for a successful and safe hike. Backpacking is also an exhausting endeavor.


Evaluate your physical and mental strength before committing to a backpacking trip. This will help both you and your group.
 Most modern backpacks are top loaded giving you access to the main compartment through the top. The bottom of your pack should be reserved for items to be used in setting up camp like a tent. All heavy items should be positioned in the center of the pack. This includes pots, pans and other cookware.


The top portion of your pack should include all the supplies you might need during your hike like snacks, tools, and a map., Check if your program provides a backpack for campers. Some will allow you to bring your own. You’ll probably need an extended trip or multi-day pack. These are anywhere from 50 liters to larger.


Get fit for your backpack at an outdoors store to avoid injury.
 You will definitely need certain supplies regardless of your trip. These supplies include a headlamp, sunscreen, matches/lighter, multi-tool pocket knife, and a water bottle.


Most camps won’t require you to bring food and cookware.
You could play it safe by bringing nuts or other types of energy snacks. Make sure you bring a strong sealable bag to avoid animals from interfering with you., For a summer backpacking trip you should bring multiple wicking t-shirts and underwear. Wicking material allows air to breath through your clothes. You should also bring a rain jacket, sweatshirt, and a baseball cap or a hat that shades your face.
 Every program is different. Some trips specialize in winter backpacking trips. These are intense trips that require additional planning and preparation.

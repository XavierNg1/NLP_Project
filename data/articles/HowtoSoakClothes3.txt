 This is an absolute must. Some fabrics are ideally suited to soaking, but others will not stand up so well to the procedure. In general, heavy, durable fabrics are great to soak, whereas delicate garments might be better suited to a scrub.


Be careful about soaking wool. It is a soft, delicate fabric, and a wool garment runs the risk of shrinking if you soak it for too long.
 If stains are especially bad, then it usually pays to rub on a small amount of detergent or the suggested stain removal agent directly to the stain. Run a web search to determine the best practice for a particular type of stain: e.g. grass, blood, food, urine.

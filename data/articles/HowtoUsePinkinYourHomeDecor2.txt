 Pink also comes in a variety of different shades that are suitable for different styles of decor. Try decorating with subtle pinks such as blush, shell pink, and rose to give your home a summery feeling. For example, use a neutral color base, such as cream or ivory with shell pink pillows, urns, and other decorative pieces. This will give your living space a light pop of pink., Dark bold pinks, such as fuchsia or hot pink, will draw a lot of attention. As a result, you should use them mainly as impact pieces that will catch the eye and hold attention. Use bold pinks in artwork, upholstery, or as part of a patterned rug. Although you can paint walls in bold pinks, some people may find this overwhelming. It is best to stick to smaller rooms or accent walls.Pair hot pink with green or navy blue to make a bold and vibrant statement.
 You can also try layering different shades and patterns of pink to create a youthful elegance. This type of decorating is called monochromatic. Use pink as a base color and then layer your accent pieces with different shades of pink. This type of decorating works nicely in the bedroom.For instance, if you are decorating a nursery or childâ€™s room you can use multiple shades of pink to create a unique look. Try layering light pink walls with bubble gum pink furniture, and hot pink floral accessories.

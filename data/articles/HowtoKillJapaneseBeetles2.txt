 Japanese beetles can be easily removed from plants with your hands. After you remove the pest from the plant, drop it into a bucket of soapy water.


Don't squish the beetle to kill it. Beetles attract more beetles through pheromones, which are so powerful they can attract beetles from a few thousand feet.If you squish a Japanese beetle, you run the risk of releasing the female beetle sex pheromone.
This should be done early in the morning. Lay out a drop cloth and shake your plants, then dump the beetles on the cloth into soapy water.
 Japanese beetles are attracted to certain plant species, so when you plan your garden, avoid plants that they will migrate towards. Carefully consult a list of susceptible plants, like this one from the Farmer's Almanac and this one from the Department of Agriculture.
 These covers allow sunlight, air, and water in, but keep beetles out. Make sure to keep the edges of the covers flush with the ground so no beetles can get through. If you already have a grub problem, avoid this method because it could potentially trap beetles inside with your plants.


You can buy floating row covers online or at garden centers.
 Japanese beetles are attracted to overripe and rotting plants.To avoid luring in beetles, harvest your plants regularly and try to keep them healthy.
 These traps use pheromones and scented lures to attract beetles. Most research has found that traps attract more beetles to a yard than it actually traps.This means you are unnecessarily attracting beetles to your yard, resulting in a larger problem. Only use this method if you have a large yard and can place the trap a significant distance away from your garden.

 For this tutorial, it doesn't matter what you start with. You could start with a sphere or a plane. Just choose whatever you're 'feeling'. There is no way to be 'wrong' here!;
, You never know what it will evolve into. Go with the flow â€“ for instance, the shape in this image appears to be growing legs.
 Or don't even try to work out your mass of feelings, and depending on whatever you need to unwind, just let it work its own way through. You are trying to relax, so give yourself that space to do so any which way.
, If you do something you don't like, CTRL Z will undo what you have done.


Once it's finished, keep a printed copy of the image for your journal as a visual display of how you felt and approached your feelings for that day.

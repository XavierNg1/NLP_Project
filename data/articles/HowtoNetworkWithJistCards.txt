 Always have some in your desk, your portfolio, or anything that you keep with you all the time.;
, While making these Jist cards,remember that you aren't working to get a job, per se, but to be remembered.



Concentrate on your different working skill sets, perhaps design a few for different 'occasions'.

Create different cards for different situations, e.g. data entry, executive assistant, administrative assistant, helicopter mechanic...

Broaden your network by having your friends and acquaintances carry them. They find themselves in the position to advocate your skills and/or knowledge.

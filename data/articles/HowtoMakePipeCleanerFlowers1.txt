 Measure down 1/3 of the way on your pipe cleaner. Fold this top into a loop, and twist the end around the rest of the pipe cleaner to secure it. You will have something that looks like a stick with a loop at one end. This will make your first petal.


This pipe cleaner will make the petal part of your flower. It can be any color you want. Popular flower colors include: white, blue, pink, and purple.;
, Measure halfway down the pipe cleaner, starting from the base of the loop. Fold this top half into a loop. Give it a quick twist to secure it. You should now have two loops next to each other. This will make your second petal.
 Fold the rest of the pipe cleaner towards the base of the second loop. Twist the around the pipe cleaner to secure it. Leave the last 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) untwisted. You will need this to put your flower together.
 Use the same steps you used to make the first set of petals.


Try to use the same color as your first pipe cleaner, unless you want a multi-colored flower.
Remember to leave behind a 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) stub.
 Take the two sets of petals, and align them so that all the loops match up. Twist the two stubs together.


When you are done twisting, you can pull the two petal sets apart, like opening a book.
 This will make the center of your flower. Leave about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) or so unrolled. You will need this stub in order to attach it to your petals.
 Push the stub down between the petals, so that it aligns with the petals' twisted stub. Hold the stubs together, and gently push the yellow disk down until it lays flat against the petals.
 Hook a green pipe cleaner around the base of your petals. Start wrapping it tightly around the petal base, moving downward. When you reach the bottom, straighten the green pipe cleaner out. This will make your flower stem.
 Give it to someone you care about, or stick it into a pretty vase.

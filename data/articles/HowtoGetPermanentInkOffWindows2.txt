 For this method, you'll need regular rubbing alcohol, a cloth or rag, and a sponge with soapy water.
 Pour some of the rubbing alcohol onto your rag until damp. Carefully wipe down the glass, applying a medium amount of pressure to clean off the ink. If necessary, apply more rubbing alcohol to your rag and repeat the process.
 When the majority of the ink has been removed, you'll need to clean off the rubbing alcohol from the glass. Use your sponge with your soapy water to clean off the glass. You could follow this up with a bit of glass cleaning spray, if desired, to remove any streaks.

 A blown fuse will turn the entire string dark, not just part of it. This often happens when too many strings are connected end-to-end. A fuse can also blow when the wires are accidentally stapled during installation, or when the lights are plugged into a socket with too high a voltage (such as US lights in a UK socket).


If only some of the lights are dark, skip down to replacing the bulbs instead.;
, A string of Christmas lights typically has one or two tiny fuses in the plastic box attached to the prongs. Examine the plastic closely on the side of this box and in between the prongs for a cover you can slide or pry open. These often get stuck, so you may need to use some force.Do not plug the lights back in at any point during this method.
 Each fuse should be transparent, with an unbroken wire running through each one. If a fuse is black, or if the wire inside is broken, it needs to be replaced.


You may need to remove the fuse and hold it up to a bright light to inspect it.
 Gently lever the blown fuses out with a thin screwdriver.
 Many Christmas lights are sold with spare fuses for this purpose. If your spares have escaped from the holiday box, take the blown fuses to an electronics store and ask for a replacement. 100-light strings typically use 3A fuses, but it's best to confirm your fuses' rating with a store employee.Never use a fuse with a higher rating. This can cause a major fire risk.
Some LED lights only require one fuse, but keep a second one in the plastic compartment as a spare.If there's a fuse that's not attached to any wires, just transfer it over to the other slot.
 Pop the new fuses into the slots and close the plastic cover. Plug the light bulbs in to see if this has fixed the problem.


If the lights still won't come on, try a different outlet in case you blew a house fuse or circuit. If that doesn't work, keep reading for other solutions.

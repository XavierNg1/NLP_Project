 Messy buns also work great, as braids do too, depending on what type of braid you choose to do.


If you're in a hurry, it's best to stick with hairstyles you're most familiar with. That way, you can do them faster and have more time for your makeup or whatever else you need to get done.






If worst comes to worse, wear your hair down for the day. Brush it out and scrunch it to add some body and height. Spray it with hairspray to lock in the body for at least a few hours. If you have time, add a cute headband (having a few patterned headbands are recommended). However, be sure the headband matches your outfit!
You can also do your hair in the bathroom at school when you have time. Just be sure you aren't missing any classes or taking too long! You could also do your hair on the bus/car.
 It's cute, chic and you can enjoy having part of your hair down while having the rest clipped up! Try adding a little body to the top of your hair for some elegance.
 Just take the hair that falls in front of your face and comb it back against your scalp. Twist it two-three times and gently push it forward for a bump. Pin it in place. Either put the remaining hair in a low ponytail or keep it down.
 The best type of ponytails are the sleek, oily kinds, but you don't have to have gross hair to do a ponytail!

 (Try using something besides their daily kibble.);
, To begin, make sure your canine is calm and not excited. When you have their full attention, sound the clicker and immediately give them a treat. Repeat this several times, until your canine understands that "click" simply means "treat"!

, Be patient, as they may still be focused on the treats! Repeat the one-word command as many times as possible until your canine performs it.
 It is not necessary to hug and kiss and overjoy them! In fact, too much praise can lead to misbehavior.
 When they have continued to do good, take the clicker away from the equation as well. By this point, your canine will do as you ask, and your praise will be enough, eliminating the need for the clicker or treats. This will also allow new commands to be more exciting for them, as they will begin getting treats again!

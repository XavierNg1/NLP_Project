 When standing up to them, you must remain calm and collected, despite the boiling hot rage you might be brewing within. It is much more effective to seem like you aren't angry and you know what you are talking about.


No matter what the bully is doing, you can stand up to them. If they are calling someone ugly, tell the person that they are wrong. The same goes for if they are insulting you.;
, Many people think they are doing this, but it ends up turning out like; "OH MY GOSH JUST BE QUIET ALL UR DOING IS BEING RUDE UGH". Reactions like this will usually excite the bully, and make them keep doing what they're doing. If you say; "Look, I know you probably think this is funny, but it isn't. You are really just hurting the feelings of innocent children in the game. If I were you, I would be extremely ashamed." Saying this will either bore or offend the bully, causing them to slow down on their insults, or try harder.
 If the bully doesn't do anything about your explanation, just get everyone to ignore him/her. This will definitely bore the bully into leaving.

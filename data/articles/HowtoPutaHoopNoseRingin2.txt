 Captive ring pliers may distort the shape of this ring. Locate the split in the ring and grab the metal on either side with both hands. Move your right hand clockwise and your left hand counterclockwise so that the ends twist away from each other in a subtle spiral.Only twist the hoop open enough to create a gap around the pierced portion of your nose.
Do not pull the ends apart sideways, since it will be nearly impossible to squeeze the ends back together again.
 Glide one open end of the hoop into the piercing hole. Slide the rest of the ring through the hole, until the bottom of the hoop is centered in the piercing and the opening lies directly below it.
 Use your fingers to gently twist both ends of the ring back toward each other, until they are brought together. Make sure the ends are brought as close as possible. This will keep the hoop secure, and the edges of the ends from scraping your nose.

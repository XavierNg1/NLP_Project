 This method is best for washing tired eyes. If your eye has been contaminated, then the ideal method is the previous bowl method. Consult an eye care professional before using this method for anything other than washing tired eyes., You want to choose a cup that is roughly the diameter of your eye socket. A thoroughly cleaned shot glass is one example of a small-diameter cup for this method.


The commercial eyewash solution or sterile water should be between 60–100°F (15.6–37.8°C)., Tilt your head down toward the cup. Place the rim of the cup snugly against your eye socket.
 While still holding the cup against your eye socket, tilt your head back so that your eye and the bottom of the cup both face upward. This will bring the solution in direct contact with your eye.


Be prepared for some small spills. Lean over a sink while you do this so that the solution doesn't run down your face and onto your clothes. If you're worried, wear a towel around your neck to keep yourself dry.
 By looking around in a circular pattern and blinking several times, you’ll help the solution cover much of your eye, which will help hydrate them or remove the contaminant., You can then lower your head to remove the cup without spilling the solution all over yourself. One round of flushing might be enough for dry, tired eyes. However, you may need to repeat in order to finish flushing a contaminant from your eyes.
 Don’t wipe at your eyes at all. Simply pat dry your closed eyelids with a clean, dry portion of the towel.

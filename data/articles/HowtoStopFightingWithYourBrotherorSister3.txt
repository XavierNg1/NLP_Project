 Pick a random but appropriate time and do something for him/her that you know he/she will appreciate (ex: going out and buying his/her favorite candy bar for him/her). If he/she asks, "Why did you do that for me?" respond with: "Because I wanted to."


This shows your sibling that - despite all the fighting you do with him/her - you still love him/her and you desire a better relationship.
Even if your sibling doesn't take time to do something in return for you, don't feel discouraged, but keep on being nice and kind to him/her. Note that you shouldn't be kind to him/her once in a while, but you should keep being nice ever single day whether he/she deserves it or not!

, That way, your sibling won't exclaim, "You've still got to do your homework so hand me the TV remote!" or "Oh my gosh! I can't believe you still haven't finished your chores!" Taking care of your agenda will eliminate the possibility of you and your sibling quarreling over who has finished what.


If you've finished your chores and your sibling has not, offer to help him/her with a part of it. Although you would prefer not to help him/her, this will help strengthen your relationship with him/her and let him/her know that you care for him/her. However, do not do all of his/her chores or else he/she might start using you.
 Your sibling deserves his/her own privacy just like you do. Keep away from reading his/her diary, checking their Instant Messaging, email, etc. Unless if you have special permission from him/her, do not invade your sibling's privacy or he/she may retaliate and invade yours!


If your sibling gives you special permission to read something personal of his/hers (ex: diary entry), do not take advantage of it and cross the borderline! Although you may be tempted to, this is not the right choice and may harm your relationship with him/her, giving your sibling a reason to be mean to you.
 Keep in mind that younger siblings tend to look up to you - even if he/she would never admit it - so don't crush his/her dreams. Be a good role model for him/her and someone he/she would want to follow and is proud of.
 This will tighten your bond with him/her and make sure sibling feel appreciated. Play with action figures, write a story together, or find a hobby that you both enjoy doing. After all, you can't fight and be happy at the same time.


Overlook tiny mistakes that he/she makes (ex: Your sibling left a dent in your favorite action figure) to avoid fighting. Your relationship with your sibling is more valuable than your items.
 Give him/her the best advice and comfort him/her if he/she needs it. Even if your sibling may not do this for you, it doesn't mean that you should give him/her the cold shoulder. In fact, if you help him/her, your sibling might feel obliged to do something nice for you too even if it isn't what you may have in mind.

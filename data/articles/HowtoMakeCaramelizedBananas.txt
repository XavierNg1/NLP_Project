 Then cut them in half, splitting the bananas into quarters. Place the banana quarters aside.;
,, Melt on medium-high heat.
 While the butter is melting and the skillet is heating up, take the butter set aside earlier and use the brush to thoroughly coat the bananas in butter.


You could also dip the bananas into the butter and let it sit, but this will make the bananas extremely buttery.
 Sprinkle the brown sugar to cover all of the bananas.
 Flip immediately and then coat that side with sugar as well. Let them sit for about one minute.
 Pour the rest of the sugar in. Let most of it sit in the pan now, in order for the brown sugar to melt and create a rich caramel.
 When the bananas are golden and slightly brown down the middle, remove from pan. Serve with whipped cream, ice cream, fresh fruits, or serve plain if you prefer it that way.

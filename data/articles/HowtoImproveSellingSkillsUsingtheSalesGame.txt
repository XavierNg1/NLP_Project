 Walk around a neighborhood and knock on a door. Look the person in the eye and see what goes on in your body. Tell them you're on a scavenger hunt and ask if they have a paperclip, canceled stamp, piece of junk mail, potato chip, etc. (use your imagination). If they ask you why you're doing it, tell them you're working on being more friendly and talking to strangers. Do this until it becomes completely natural.;
, Find something inexpensive. (Don't worry about the stories in your head or what people will say/think, most people throw them away). Wrap them in Xmas wrapping paper or some other gift wrap. Start with 10 and approach random people and come up with a story that is natural to you. (Notice how we usually tell white lies...try telling the truth). Notice what goes on in your body when people say no and look at you strangely. Don't worry about them, just go on to someone else. The next 10 give to someone of the opposite sex you find attractive. After that, the final 10 should go to someone of the same sex who reminds you of your parent of that sex.
 Under a buck. Then create a sales script that you can memorize. Make the pitch less than 60 seconds long. Something like this: "Hi, you look like you might like to have fun. (This stops them, you've got about 10 seconds to keep their attention). I'm supposed to sell these "articles" and if I can't have fun doing it, I don't want to do it. It takes 60 seconds, would you listen?" If they say no, say thanks and you're on to your next prospect. If they say yes, give them the rest of your pitch. Tell them it's a game that your playing to break up your habit of not approaching strangers. Be light. Have fun. Watch their eyes and see if you can smile and connect with them.
 "Would you buy this "article" for $1 now?) Most people never ask for the sale, you've got to ask every time. If they say "no" say ok, I had fun and thanks for playing (this is a game). If they say "yes," make the exchange and see how great you feel.

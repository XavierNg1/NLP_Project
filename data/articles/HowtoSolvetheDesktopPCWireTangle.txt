 This first plug branches out to two simple power strips ( always on ),(three or four sockets each ) placed at both sides of your desk. From this initial " Y " layout you fit the rest according to your needs and likes. In the photo a pilot light in the right corner is housed in the switch for the modem, to turn it off when not in use; modems have no problem re-catching the signal after being switched off. On the right side there are two power strips placed in opposite directions', a simple security trick to avoid switching the PC absentmindedly,(you have to bend a little further to reach it because the CPU switch is a bit out of the way, almost next to the modem switch). On the contrary, the disks switch is quite at hand, on the right as well. Under the board some cables can be seen linking right and left sides, suspended from open eye bolts inserted in the down side of the countertop.;

. Again, as on the right, an " always on ", 4 socket power outlet, gives power to an "off/on" power strip.
 This power strip is connected to the PC power stripwhich in turn gives power to another switchable power strip where the hard disks adapters are plugged in.As a result you can only switch the hard disks on, if the PC is already working, giving you great ease of use, besides the pilot lamp on the switches will tell you if you forgot switching them off while " in session". ON THE LEFT, a square four-socket plug supplies energy to a lamp, to a telephone adapter and to a long power strip which powers the printer and the loudspeakers. Being able to turn them off is a very welcome feature when you want to relax reading to some music background on the headphones. A red pilot light, sticking out from under the counter, tells you if this long power strip is on or off; that's quite useful to save you a fright or some discomfort when you switch the PC back on forgetting you had left this last two elements powered on. .

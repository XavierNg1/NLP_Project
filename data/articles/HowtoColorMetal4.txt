 Remove all dust, dirt and fingerprints from the metal before beginning. Wash the metal with soap and water. Let the metal soak in a degreaser. Place it on a clean surface to dry.


Do not handle the metal with your hands after cleaning. Even the grease from your fingers can impact the formation of the colors.
Heat adds color to metals in a fairly unpredictable way that varies based on temperature, humidity, time, and the composition of the metal., You can use this method on any metals containing copper or iron, such as steel. A smaller, focused flame, such as a Bunsen burner or torch, will provide a more dramatic variation of colors. An open flame will create more of a subtle variation. Depending on the temperature that the metal reaches you can create a color from pale yellow to blue.Use some tongs or a wrench or similar tool to grip the metal to avoid contacting the heated metal after exposing it to the flame.
If you have an oven you can also heat the metal that way to provide a more even coloration.
 There is not much you can do to control the pattern or formation of the coloration. You can only somewhat control the color by how long you heat the metal. You will notice that the piece doesn't remain the same color as it cools from the heat. For example, reds may cool to bluish purples.


Be sure to heat metal only in a well-ventilated area.
Use caution not to burn yourself. Wear some work gloves.
If your flame is fine and your metal piece large enough, you can trace patterns onto your metal.
 Turn off the torch or heat source. Set the metal down somewhere safe, like a concrete floor, to cool. You may want to have a bucket of cold water on hand to dip the hot metal in and cool it quickly.
 If you are working a piece of jewelry or art, you may want to apply a sealant to protect and give the metal a glossy finish. After the metal cools, apply a coat of beeswax or an acrylic clear coat to protect the colors and the surface.Allow the finish to dry.

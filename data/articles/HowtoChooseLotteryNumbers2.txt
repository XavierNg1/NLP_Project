 The Delta Lotto method is way to choose lottery numbers based on a statistical study of numbers that are next to each other. This information has been related back to winning lottery numbers, which has formed the basis for this method. In other words, the delta method is based on research, but keep in mind there’s no guarantee you’re going to win if you choose your numbers this way., The number should be between 1 and 5. For instance, the number 1 is a good number to choose because often, more than 60% of the time, the number 1 is part of the winning delta numbers included in the series. However, feel free to choose another low number that you feel good about such as 3 or 5 There is no exact science. Example: 1

, There are a number of combinations that you could choose from. For instance, you could choose 3 and 5. Or, 2 and 6 could be an option. You could also choose two consecutive numbers like 7 and 8. Example: 3 and 5 Sequence: 1-3-5

, It can be above the number 8 , such as the number 9. Or, it can be below, for instance, 7. For the fourth number, pick something pretty close to 8 ,either above or below it. Example:9 Sequence 1-3-5-9

, Choose two numbers a few numbers away from each other such as 11 and 13. Another option could be 14 and 9 or 10 and 14. Choose the numbers randomly or choose your favorite numbers between the given range. The smaller number doesn’t have to be listed first. Example: 11 and 13 Sequence: 1-3-5-9-11-13.
 Once you have selected 6 numbers in the method described, you have created a six-digit lottery number sequence. Write it down in the order that you selected them. In our example, the numbers are 1-3-5-9-11-13

, Make sure the sum of the numbers is not greater than the highest number allowed in the game you’re playing. For instance, if the highest lottery number you can play is 56, then our numbers are within the range because the total sum equals 42. 1 +3+5+9+11+13 = 42


If your is within about about 15 from the total but not greater than the total, then you have selected some good numbers.
If you need to select different numbers so that you sum is not greater than the highest lottery number, then do so.
It’s okay if numbers repeat themselves where applicable. For instance, you’re number close to 8 could be the number 9, and you could also select 9 for your number between 8 and 15. If you need to do this to make sure that your sum total is not greater, that is fine. Remember numbers sometimes repeat in winning lottery numbers.
 Delta numbers aren’t usually in sequential order. So, change the numbers around a bit. Put the first number last and the last number first. Put the numbers in the middle at the end or beginning. Rearrange them so that they are in a different order. For example, our numbers rearranged could be 1-3-5-9-11-13 or it could be 5-3-11-9-1-13. There are a number of different variations that you could have., For now, our delta series is 5-3-11-9-1-13. This is not your final lottery number. You will use these numbers to create your lottery number sequence.
 The first delta number of the series becomes the first lottery number of your lottery sequence. It remains unchanged. However, the remainder of the numbers will be added together to create the lottery numbers. For example:, the first lottery number is 5. Example: 5

, (5 +3 =8) This sum of these two become your second lottery number, the number 4. Repeat this for the rest of the delta numbers. Adding the sum of the numbers next to each other is how you create each number in the series to create your final lottery number sequence. If our delta numbers are 5-3-11-9-1-13, then our lottery numbers are created in the following way:


The first lottery number is 5. Example: 5-
The second lottery number is created by adding the first lottery number to the second delta number. For our example, we get 8 as the sum of 5 and 3. The number 8 is our second lottery number. For example, the number ares 5,8 so far. Example: 5-8-
Add the second lottery number to the third delta number. For example, the number 8 is our second lottery number. Our third delta number is 11. For instance, the number 8 plus 11 equals 19. ( 8+11 =19) So, nineteen is our third lottery number. For example, the lottery numbers are 5,8,19 so far. Example: 5-8-19-
Add the third lottery number and the fourth delta number. In our case, 19 is our third lottery number and 9 is our fourth delta number. For instance, 19 plus 9 equals 28. (19+9 = 28) Twenty-eight is our fourth lottery number. The numbers are 5,8,19 and 28 thus far. Example 5-8-19-28-
Add the fourth lottery number and the fifth delta number. For our example, 28 is our fourth lottery number and 1 is our fifth delta number. Twenty-eight plus 1 equals 29. (28 +1 = 29) So, Twenty-nine is our fifth lottery number. Thus far, the numbers are 5,8,19, 28 and 29. Example: 5-8-19-28-29-
Add the fifth lottery number and the sixth delta number. In this case, 29 is our fifth lottery number and 13 is our sixth delta number. 29 + 13 =42 . Forty-two is our sixth lottery number. The lottery numbers are 5,8,19,28,29 and 42 so far. Example: 5-8-19-28-29-42
Our final lottery numbers are 5-8-19-28-29-42. Now, your numbers are ready to play. Repeat the process again to create another delta number.

 Pour the cream into a small saucepan and set it over medium heat. Wait for bubbles to develop before continuing.


You must heat the cream slowly, so do not use any temperature above medium. If the cream gets too hot, it could curdle and ruin the texture and taste of the sauce.
 Break the blue cheese into small crumbles, then sprinkle those crumbles over the cream. Stir the cheese into the cream with a mixing spoon.


Stir the sauce rapidly and continuously after adding the blue cheese. Doing so distributes the heat evenly and allows the cheese to melt before the cream has a chance to curdle.
 Continue heating and stirring the mixture until the cheese completely melts and the sauce becomes smooth.


The heat still needs to remain at medium since the dairy-based sauce can curdle easily. If the sauce begins to simmer rapidly during this stage, turn the heat down to an even lower heat setting.
 Remove the sauce from the stove and immediately serve it over cooked steak.


You can store this sauce for about one week if you keep in a sealed plastic or glass container in your refrigerator.
This sauce is best served warm and can be reheated using the stove or microwave.

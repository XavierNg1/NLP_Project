 In this page, you can either chat with a Microsoft support representative or request a call from support to start the cancellation of your Xbox Live membership.


In choosing to chat with a representative, you will be making your cancellation request by actually chatting with a Microsoft representative. Just indicate your concern before opening the chat window.
Instead of you contacting Microsoft support, you can just request a representative to contact you instead by clicking the "Request a Call from Support" option in the Contact Us page. Just indicate the contact number you wish to be reached at, and have that phone nearby.
 Again, be specific in communicating with the representative. Remember, you can cancel your Xbox Live subscription instantly if you request that specifically.
 You may be placed in a queue or line if the representatives are still busy at the time of your request. The wait time is indicated on the page.

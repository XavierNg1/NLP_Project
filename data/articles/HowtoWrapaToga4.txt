 While standing, hold a sheet horizontally in front of you. Fold the sheet in half, until it is the proper length. It should cover from your armpits to your legs. Decide on how much leg you want to show or cover.
 Holding the folded sheet horizontally in front of you, first wrap one side around your chest and then the other side, much like a towel. Leave 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) of one corner loose at the front of your body., Twist the 4 foot (1.2 m) length a few times to make a rope. Run this twisted sheet over your shoulder and behind your neck. Tie the end of the twist to the sheet running across your chest., Spend some time smoothing the layers and folds, then pin the toga onto your tube top. Take extra time to pin the halter securely.
 Although optional, this adds interest. For example, tie a belt or rope just under the bust or at the natural waist. Pin a brooch on your chest just under one of the halter straps.

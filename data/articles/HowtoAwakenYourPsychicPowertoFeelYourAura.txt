 It works best if you are lying down flat on your back, comfortable with your head on a pillow. A great time to try this is once you're off to bed. Close your eyes and relax.;
, Then bring both of your hands together above your belly so that the finger tips of your left hand are touching the finger tips of your right hand. It will almost look like you're praying. When your hands are completely relaxed, your fingers will naturally bend, they should not be forced straight. When your finger tips are touching with your hands relaxed, there should be enough space between your palms that you could hold a soft ball in your hands. This is the starting position.
 If your hands touch, you can no longer feel the aura. The aura leaving each of your hands will form a zone of resistance between your hands, which you should be able to feel as your hands are moving toward one another. It will feel as if you are holding a balloon between your hands, and as your hands move together, you will feel the balloon "squeeze".
 Once you've discovered this resistance, you are now feeling your aura. You can now start moving your hands father apart, then back together again slightly to create a bigger balloon. With a little practice, you can feel your aura between your outstretched hands, with your hands as much as 100 centimetres or 36 inches apart.Â

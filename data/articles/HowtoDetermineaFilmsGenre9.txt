 Comedy films are pretty easy to spot. A comedy movie's main emphasis is humor, and these types of movies attempt to make audiences laugh and generally generate positive feelings.
 If it does, the movie's an action comedy. Films such as Beverly Hills Cop belong to this sub-genre.


If the movie does mix action and comedy, make sure it's more slapstick humor than intense violence, or you may be watching a dark comedy.
 If it does, you're watching a mockumentary. This sub-genre is often used to poke fun at world issues of cultures. Use films such as Borat and This Is Spinal Tap as a guideline.
 If so, you're probably watching a rom-com, or romantic comedy. Films like Love Actually, Notting Hill, and Pretty Woman belong to this sub-genre.
 This is a satirical film. Movies like Airplane! and The Interview are works of satire.
 If so, you're most likely watching a dark comedy. Dark comedies attempt to make light of normally dark subjects, such as death, terrorism, or crime. Movies such as American Psycho, Pulp Fiction, and Fight Club blend dark subject matter with humorous elements.
 This is a tragicomic, or tragicomedy. Movies such as American Beauty, Life Is Beautiful, and About Schmidt fall into this category.

 It should ideally be on level ground.


Dig a shallow hole for your first block's location. Use a hand tamper to make the soil level and compact. Add 2 or 3 inches (5 or 7.5 cm) of gravel to the hole.
Set a 4-inch-thick (10 cm) concrete block into the hole. The gravel will help prevent any rainwater that could run under the shed from washing away loose soil.
Continue placing 4-inch (10 cm) concrete blocks in this manner in evenly spaced, straight rows. The number of blocks you need and their spacing depends on your shed's dimensions.
Stack 2-inch-thick (5 cm) blocks on top of the initial concrete blocks to level the foundation as necessary.
 The number and length of pieces you will need depends on your shed's dimensions. The 2 by 4-inch (5 by 10 cm) measurements refer to each board's width and depth., Each frame should have a slanted top and a center board as a crosspiece.

Let the cedar roof hang down the sides and front of the shed., The height of the doors should reach the bottom edge of the 2 by 6 (5 by 15 cm) header board.,, Use strong hinges to attach the doors to the shed.

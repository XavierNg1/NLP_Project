 Although you may be in complete love with that movie star or music star at the moment, you may not feel that way in five years - in other words, don't choose a theme that you know probably won't last, unless you can change it easily. For example, it is much easier to change themed lampshades and bedding than it is to change themed wallpaper. A basic theme and two or three principle colors works well.;
, It can make a huge difference. Re-arrange furniture if you see fit. Organize your closet and get rid of or store clothing that you don't wear anymore.
 Is it the ugly flower stenciling above your bed or the paint job that looks awful? Focus on fixing your main concerns before attempting to change anything else.
 Changing your bedding is an easy way to create a theme that will resonate through your room. Also, solid colors or "clean" looking colors can instantly make your room seem cleaner and put together, especially when coordinated with the rest of the room. Bed-in-a-bags are handy for people on a budget. If you feel your current bedspread doesn't mesh with your design plans, sticking to ones from Walmart, JC Penny's, or Kohl's is a good way to stay on track with your expenses.
 A valance can tie your room together, while curtains give you a certain privacy.
 A coat of paint can spruce up that old pine dresser or bookshelf. Approve it with your parents first. Many stores sell "oops" paint that was mixed incorrectly for rock-bottom prices. Sometimes you can find just the right color, or, if you find something close (but lighter than what you're looking for), a skilled employee can add tint to get a shade closer to what you're looking for.
 Try making things like interesting sculptures with creative items or homemade art. A framed paint-by-numbers from the dollar store can be cute. Or, enlist a friend in making you a pretty picture.

 Place the cantaloupe under running water and use a vegetable brush to scrub the entire surface. Because these melons grow on the ground, they do sometimes carry food-borne pathogens like salmonella, so washing is very important.

It’s not necessary or recommended to wash any fruits or vegetables with soap or detergent. Clean water and a good scrubbing will safely remove dirt and pathogens from the cantaloupe.;
, Place the melon on a cutting board or durable flat surface. Hold the melon steady and carefully cut it in half, through the middle, with a sharp knife. It’s not necessary to remove the skin from a cantaloupe before cutting it.Cantaloupe rind isn't edible, but when you cut the fruit into hand-held wedges, you can eat the fruit right off the rind.
 Place the melon halves so the cut sides are facing upward. Use a spoon to scrape out the seeds from the center of each half. Take care to remove as little fruit with the seeds as possible, because that’s where you'll find the juiciest and sweetest flesh.Discard the seeds into a compost bin or garbage once they’ve been removed, or clean them and roast them like pumpkin seeds for a delicious and nutritious snack.
 Turn the melon halves over so they're cut-side down on the cutting board. Cut each half in half again to form large quarter wedges. Carefully cut each of those wedges in half again (lengthwise) to form eight small wedges.For a very small snack or to feed lots of people, cut each wedge in half again for a total of 16 wedges.
 Once the wedges are cut, you can serve them as is to be eaten as hand-held snacks. To eat cantaloupe like this, hold a wedge by the rind and eat the fruit from the rind by taking small bites.Don’t eat the greenish flesh touching the rind.

Discard the rind when there's no orange fruit left on it.

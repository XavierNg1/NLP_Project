 Put a small amount of olive oil in the pan and set the burner to medium heat.There should be enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Substitute butter or bacon grease for the oil if desired.If you use bacon grease, keep in mind the eggs won’t look as neat due to meat particles and the coloring of the grease.
If you have extra burners and skillets, have multiple pans going at the same time to prepare the eggs faster.;
, Do this once the oil becomes shinier, indicating that it’s warm. Have a bowl ready to put the eggshells into as you go. You may want to cook three eggs at a time to keep the process manageable.Burner heats may vary. Make sure the heat isn’t so high that the eggs sizzle and whiten as soon as they hit the pan. The whites should stay translucent for a few seconds.
 You can ensure that the egg tops are cooked and not runny by spooning oil over them. Alternately, you can use a lid and spoonfuls of water.


With a small spoon, take hot oil from the bottom of the pan. Carefully pour hot oil over the whites of the eggs only. Wait a couple of minutes until the whites are set and no longer wiggly. Then spoon hot oil over the yolks.To use water instead of oil, pour one or two tablespoons of water into the empty space of the pan. Put the lid on the pan. Cook the eggs until the whites have set and aren’t loose or runny., Transfer the eggs gently to their serving dishes using a spatula. If multiple burners and skillets don’t make enough eggs all at once, you will need a way to keep the eggs warm as you repeat the steps for another batch. For the finished eggs, remove the pans from heat and put lids on them to keep the heat in. Alternately, transfer the eggs to a large serving plate and cover it with a lid. Then separate and serve them when the next batch is finished.

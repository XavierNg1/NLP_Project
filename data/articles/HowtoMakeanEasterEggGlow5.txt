 After the dye or paint dries, remove the rubber bands. The covered areas will be white and free of paint, leaving cool-looking stripes behind.
 This technique works for raw or hard-boiled eggs (not plastic). The wax of the crayon will repel the dye, leaving white space in whatever shape or design was drawn on the egg.
 If you put an egg into a small glass or tumbler with about an inch of dye in it and just enough width for an egg, the egg can soak just its bottom half in the dye. Let the egg dry, turn it over, and put it white-side down into a similar glass with a different color of dye.


You can also experiment using larger, flat containers with shallow (several millimeters) of dye in them.
Sit an egg carefully in the shallow dye, so that it does not roll. Take it out and let it dry.
This will result in a 'spot' or circle of dye on one side of the egg. Turn the egg so that another area faces downward and soak in the dye. Dry off and repeat until you have created a spotted egg.

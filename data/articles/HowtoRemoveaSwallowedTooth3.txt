 Inducing vomiting is not recommended unless recommended by a doctor. Vomiting after swallowing a foreign object could cause you to aspirate (inhale) the tooth into your lungs. If given the OK by a doctor, vomiting can remove the tooth from the stomach.
 In order to retrieve the tooth, youâ€™ll want to use a container or a sink with the drain closed. As unpleasant as it may sound, try to throw up into a colander that will catch the tooth and allow the watery content to run through, so you can avoid having to search through vomit for a tooth- which may just cause you to throw up more.
 The most common way to induce vomiting is to stick one or two fingers into the back of your throat. Tickle the far back of your throat until your gag reflex causes you to vomit.
 Ipecac syrup is an emetic remedy designed to induce vomiting. Use as directed, and mix a small amount with water. Drink it down quickly, and it should make you feel some nausea, followed by stomach contractions which will cause you to vomit.
 Be very careful; drinking too much salt water can lead to severe dehydration and even death. Mixing three teaspoons of salt into a sixteen ounce glass of warm water and drinking it down should make you vomit within twenty to thirty minutes.
 Mix a tablespoon of prepared mustard into a cup of warm water. Your stomach should react in a similar fashion to the salt water.

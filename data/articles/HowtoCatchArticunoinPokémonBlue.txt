 You'll need a Pokémon that knows Surf.


The easiest way to reach there is to go to Fuchsia City and start surfing first to the south and then west.;
, This area is full of puzzles, and there are 5 floors with water bodies with currents which may flow you back to where the current ends each time. You need to stop the current by blocking it by boulders.


These boulders have to be pushed inside a hole with the help of a Pokémon who knows the move Strength. There are 4 boulders, but only 2 of them will block currents blocking your path to Articuno.
 Surf towards north. You will see a bird sitting on a platform. This is Articuno.
 This will help just in case you knock it out. You will be able to get it back.
 You should have these arrangements to catch it easily:


An Electric-type or Fire-type Pokémon
At least 50 Ultra Balls
Hyper Potions
A Pokémon that knows a move which may paralyze Pokémon or put them to sleep

, Then paralyze it or put it to sleep. After this, start throwing Ultra Balls.

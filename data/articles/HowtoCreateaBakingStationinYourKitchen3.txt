 Make a list of your most-used recipes, and then think about the ingredients you need for those recipes. Get out your baking supplies, and check for what you already have. You probably already have flour, sugar, and vanilla, but you may not have ingredients like cornmeal, cornstarch, yeast, brown sugar, and corn syrup, which are common in some recipes., You've probably seen a line-up of canisters to hold common ingredients. You don't have to get a pretty matching set, but having a canister for each ingredient is important. You'll need one for flour, one for each type of sugar you use, and smaller containers for things like spices, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.Make sure each container is labeled so you don't have to open it to figure out what it is.
 If your baking station storage is a jumble of bottles and canisters, you'll never know what you have on hand and what you need to get. That's how you end up with several bags of brown sugar, for instance. Have a place and container for every ingredient you use, and organize them by how you use them., If you start adding in other items, such as random household items or other kitchen items, everything will be cluttered, and you won't be able to find what you need. Make sure your baking station is just for baking items, even if it's only a small area., That is, if you use certain items in both baking and cooking, consider having them in both areas. That holds true for ingredients like cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, but it's also true for items like stirring spoons and whisks.

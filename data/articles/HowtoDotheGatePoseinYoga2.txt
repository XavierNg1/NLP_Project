 Point your toes to the right and your kneecap towards the ceiling. Do your best to touch the bottom of your right foot all the way to the floor while keeping your leg straight. It's okay if your pelvis turns slightly to the right, but keep your upper body facing forward.
 Keep your palms facing down.
 Turn your left palm up and extend it upwards towards the ceiling.
 Your bicep should rest on your left ear. Turn your head so that you are looking at the ceiling. Keep moving your left hip forward slightly. Turn your torso away from the floor.
 Lower your arms and move your right knee to the left. Repeat the pose for the same amount of time on the other side.

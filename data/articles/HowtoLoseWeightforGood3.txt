 One of the worst things you can do for weight loss is skip breakfast. If you eat early in the morning when you wake up, your metabolism will start working as soon as you get up. If you skip breakfast, your body goes into starvation mode and will stop burning fat as you expend calories during the morning. Plus, you will be less likely to give in to the temptation to snack throughout the day. Eat a sensible breakfast with protein, fruits, and whole grains to decrease your appetite throughout the day and help your metabolism work better.Have a piece of whole wheat or whole grain bread with some peanut or almond butter and a piece of fruit. You can also make it into a peanut butter and banana or apple sandwich. This meal has plenty of protein and whole grains to keep you full throughout the morning.Try half a cup of old fashioned oatmeal with a tablespoon of nuts and a half a cup of fruit. Microwave the fruit to warm it and mix it and the nuts into the oatmeal once you've cooked it. Use combinations like strawberries and almonds or bananas and walnuts.This gives you a hearty breakfast that will keep you full longer. It also has just the right amount of sweetness to satiate your sweet tooth.
If you don't like oatmeal, try an egg white omelette with spinach, tomato, and avocado. Mix 1/4 cup spinach into the omelette and have some cherry tomatoes and fourth of an avocado on the side. This has plenty of protein, fiber, and other essential nutrients that will sustain you throughout the day.
 If you have balanced lunches and dinners, you are less likely to overeat throughout the day, which will help you keep your weight off. Combine protein rich foods such as fish, chicken, other lean meats, beans, nuts, and tofu with fiber rich foods such as whole grains and vegetables to fill yourself up with every meal. The two components work together to keep you satisfied and fuller for longer periods of time.


For lunch, try a salmon salad with sauteed salmon, spinach, pecans, tomatoes, and feta cheese. You can also try chicken salad made with Greek yogurt, nuts, and grapes in half of a whole-wheat pita.
For dinner, try a fillet of tilapia sauteed with tomatoes and dill with a side of roasted broccoli, a portion of great northern beans, and sauteed green beans. You can also try baked tofu with chickpeas, kale chips, and roasted brussel sprouts.
Avoid foods with a lot of carbohydrates and sugars. Pasta, rice, and other starchy carbs will keep the pounds on you or pack them back on. Eat grains such as brown rice or quinoa if you want these foods in your diet.
Also focus on portions. You don't want your plate overrun with too much food or too many calories. Make sure half your plate is full of vegetables and avoid large helpings., Eating a small snack between meals will help you eat less during your meals and keep you from overeating. Snacks are typically eaten between each meal and between dinner and bed. Try to aim for two snacks a day during the times that you find yourself getting the most hungry. For example, if you find yourself getting hungry between lunch and dinner and between dinner and bed, have your snacks then. If you are hungry between breakfast and lunch and between dinner and bed, eat then. Just make sure they are small and healthy snacks, not full meals.


Try eating a tablespoon or two of almond butter with an apple or carrot sticks or a small wrap or half sandwich with a fourth a cup of chicken salad made with Greek yogurt and grapes. The protein will fight off hunger and the sweetness will help keep you satisfied.
 Vegetables are essential to any healthy lifestyle and will help you keep the weight off. Vegetables like kale, spinach, squash, avocado, beets, turnips, and carrots are full of fiber, potassium, and essential vitamins and nutrients that will help you stay healthy and lose weight. This will also help you eat less meat and carbohydrates such as pasta, which are full of fat and calories. Incorporate them into two to three of your meals as well as your snacks. The added fiber and other nutrients will help you get full faster, which will help you eat less and lose weight. Plus, you will be healthier overall.


In meals that you love such as pizza, instead of adding tons of cheese or pepperoni, try adding more veggies such as spinach, peppers, artichokes, tomatoes, or broccoli. Also switch to whole wheat crust. The veggies and crust taste great on the pizza and will actually fill you up faster, which will help you eat less and lose more weight.For a snack, have carrots with a tablespoon of hummus or peanut butter. The carrots are great for dipping and they taste great with both of these spreads. Plus, the fiber and protein in the snack will cut your cravings fast.
Instead of french fries, try some veggie fries instead. Try roasting other root veggies such as beets, squash, and turnips for dinner. Cut them into strips, sprinkle them with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt, and cook them in the oven. They are a much healthier option than potatoes and will fill you up faster.
Opt for dark leafy greens such as kale, mustard greens or spinach instead of lettuce. These dark green leaves are rich in antioxidants as well as vitamins A, C, E and K. They also have tons of fiber to keep your feeling full and satisfied longer.If you love pasta, substitute zucchini or spaghetti squash for your noodles. They have a similar texture and consistency as pasta but with much fewer calories and carbohydrates and many more hunger and fat fighting nutrients. Simply cut your zucchini into thin strips either by hand or with a vegetable cutter. The spaghetti squash comes out of the rind in tendrils that look like spaghetti, which is where it got its name. Saut√© the vegetables in a pan with a little bit of water until they are cooked. Then add the rest of your ingredients like you normally would for a great and healthy Italian dinner.
 While eating meat and oils that are lower in fat is good for you, avoid buying fat-free products, particularly dairy-derived products other than milk. The natural fats that appear in foods actually help you stay fuller longer. Plus, when the fat is removed from products like yogurt, manufacturers typically incorporate additives, such as excess sugar, that are less nutritious. In the long run, the extra fat will actually help you eat less and keep your weight off.


Try to buy lite options of dairy products instead. The only difference is that these are typically made with 2% milk instead of whole. These products don't have additives and still have hunger fighting fats, but they have less fat overall., Drinks can be a hidden source of extra calories in your everyday life. If you drink sugary sodas, you add a few hundred calories to your diet per can. Instead, substitute water for soda and regular coffee or hot tea for your latte. Even natural choices such as fruit juices pack tons of sugar. Opt for a piece of whole fruit instead, which provides valuable fiber.If you want to add something to your coffee, add some 2% or skim milk instead of cream. If you like sweetener, substitute all natural, no calorie sweeteners such as stevia or monk fruit.
If you like the carbonation of sodas, try seltzer water. You get the carbonation of soda without the sugar and artificial ingredients.
 One of the worst things for weight loss is eating out. The ingredients and calorie content are hard to control, so you can end up eating way too many calories without realizing. Try to cook at home as much as possible. This way, you can control what kinds of foods you are eating and keep the nutrition balance.


If you have to eat out, try grilled meat options with vegetables or salads with minimal or no dressing. Also pay attention to portion sizes. Split a portion if it seems like it is larger than necessary for one person.
Steer clear of pasta, fatty meats, and fried foods. These are full of calories and lack nutrients that will help you stay fuller longer., When you are at the grocery store, avoid picking up any junk food such as chips, candy, or heavy desserts. If you don't have them in your house, you won't be tempted to splurge on them in a moment of weakness. Instead, buy healthy options for snacking, such as nuts, peanut or almond butter, fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, raisins, or dark chocolate.


Try making a trail mix with unsalted almonds, raisins or dried apricots, dark chocolate morsels, and all natural granola. The mixture has sweet and savory elements and is packed with hunger fighting nutrients., There are certain foods that all of us love that aren't the most healthy. Instead of cutting out these foods forever, allow yourself to have them every once in a while to maintain a sense of balance. Try not to use food to reward yourself for hitting a certain weight or dieting goal, but go ahead and have a slice of cake on your birthday.

 This means you should be nearly complete with the application and be able to provide the supplementary materials to the letter writer for reference. This may include:


Copy of your transcript
Writing sample or portfolio of work
Statement of purpose or cover letter
Curriculum Vitae or resume
Name of the institution
Degree or fellowship program applying for
Name of the contact at the institution receiving the letter
Address and dates for sending the letter
Any necessary letter forms, prompts, or the URL to complete and upload the letter

, Tell the most desirable candidates on your list that you hope to use them as a reference, in person if possible. Inform them of the general guidelines, due dates, and provide them with the necessary resources at this time.
 Ask directly whether or not they're willing to write you a positive letter of recommendation. If not, or they're unsure of whether or not they'll have time to complete it, move to other candidates on your list.
 Professors and academic advisors are generally happy to provide recommendations and consider doing so part of their professional responsibilities. However, because of the sheer volume of requests they receive, you should be sure to request the letter of recommendation well in advance of any admissions application or other deadlines.


A good rule of thumb is making first contact a semester ahead of time to gauge their willingness to write a letter, and then making sure they have all materials at least a month or two before the deadline.
 Thank your references for providing letters with a note or phone call. Also, it's a good idea to keep them updated on your progress. They have a stake in your success, so let them know if you've been offered a spot at the university or program. This will also keep the door open if you need more letters somewhere down the road.

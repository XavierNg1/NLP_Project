 Without proper form, your shooting will be less effective. Always keep your elbow in, bend your knees, and keep your eyes on the basket.;
, A mistake many aspiring basketball players make is by playing with others before they are ready. Play by yourself, harness your skills, and then you can go out and play some guys.
 If you shoot the ball, know that you're going to make it because, if you hesitate or lose faith in your shot, you won't improve.
 If you're tall, practice playing in the paint. If you're a shooter, practice shooting the ball. If you can master one part of the game, the rest of your game will open up.
 If all you do is shoot, your opponent will play you tight and, if you only dribble, they'll guard the lane. If you change it up, though, then your opponent won't know what you'll do next, giving you the upper hand.
 If you mess around while practicing, or, if you don't give one hundred percent every time you play, then it will rub off on how you perform during the games.
 It's hard to improve if you play with people who don't challenge you and it's better to have someone who'll push you to play your best.
 First look to make your middle school team, then your high school team, then college, and then hopefully the N.B.A. Always have a goal to reach.
 If he/she is small, post him/her up. If he/she is slow, drive into the lane. This won't only help you to score, but it will help your teammates score because it opens the defense.
 If you pass, not only will your teammate get better, but it will take some of the workload off your shoulders too. Oh, and always cheer on your teammates when you're on the bench, it makes the game more enjoyable for everyone.
 you don't want other players to know how and when your going to shoot. Don't shoot at the same spot all the time; change your shot's position all the time

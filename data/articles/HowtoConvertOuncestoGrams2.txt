 If you're stuck without a calculator, try this trick for converting ounces to grams in your head. Start by multiplying your ounces by 30. This is easy in your head — it's the same as multiplying by 3 and adding a 0.


Let's use the method in this section to convert 8 ounces to grams again. 8 × 30 is the same as 8 × 3 (24), plus a 0 (240).
 To do this, you can just take the zero off. In other words, it's the same as your original number times three.


In our example, 10% of 240 is 24 (we just took the 0 off).
 With this strategy, you can get very close to the 28.35 conversion without even touching a calculator.


Half of 24 is 12. 240 - 12 = 228 grams. This pretty close to our original answer (226.8 grams) — especially for not using a calculator.

 Set out your school clothes by your bed that evening so that you don't have to panic the next day about what to wear.;
, If you pack your own lunch then it's a better idea to pack it in the morning.



If you have any homework due next week or even tomorrow then get it done. Don't wait around for later, thinking that it won't matter if you just get an OK grade. Do it earlier and do your best so that you can get a good grade.
 Being that girl that everyone can count on will give you an awesome, responsible feeling. Always carry with you a spare pen or pencil, and carry some scrap paper with you in case your friends might need it during or after class.
 If you go to a school where having a locker is optional, then choose to have one! They're super helpful and they lighten up your bag a bit. You can go get your books that you need for each class either in-between classes or during interval and breaks.
 If you need to get up quite early in the morning for school or work then go to bed early too. By doing this, you'll feel much better the next day and you won't look like a zombie. Plus, set an alarm on your clock or your phone too.

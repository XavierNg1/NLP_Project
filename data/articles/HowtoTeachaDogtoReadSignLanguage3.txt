 With deaf dogs, you have to make sure they are watching you before giving them a signal. Therefore, the first thing you must teach them is a "watch me" sign. Pick a hand signal for it. Make the hand signal for your dog, and then point to your nose. When your dog looks up at you, give a hand flash or a thumbs up (as a replacement for the clicker that some trainers use), and then give him a treat and praise. Practice this signal with him until he understands he needs to look at you with the "watch me" sign.This method should also work just fine if you are deaf and are working with a hearing dog.
 Choose what you want your first trick to be. As noted, "Sit" is always a good place to begin. Choose your hand sign for "Sit.", After doing the "watch me" sign, give the dog the sign for the command you want to teach. Immediately use a treat to position him for the command.For instance, for "Sit," hold the treat in front of his nose, and then move it above his head so his butt hits the floor., As soon as the dog is in the correct position, give him praise and attention. Offer him the treat as reward., Continue practicing the command. Once the dog seems to understand, remove the treat from the equation. Practice the hand sign without the treat until the dog has it down pat.

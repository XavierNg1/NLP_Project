 Use 1 pound (453.59 g) of peanuts still in their shells. Drain the peanuts. Next, put them in a large stockpot. Add 4 cups (.96 L) of fresh water and 4 tablespoons (59.14 mL) of kosher salt to the stockpot.You can also add 2 tablespoons (29.57 mL) of smoked paprika, Old Bay Seasoning, shrimp boil mix, or star anise to the water with the salt.
 Reduce the heat to a very low boil, and cover the stockpot. Boil the peanuts until they are soft. The longer you boil them, the saltier and softer they will become. Try boiling them for as few as 2 hours for firmer, less salty nuts or up to 12 hours for a very soft and salty nut., Drain the nuts, but do not rinse them. Store the boiled peanuts in an airtight container. Eat or serve all the peanuts within 2 or 3 days after preparing them. They will dry out and become inedible after that.

 Being vigilant in the classroom is the best way to catch students cheating and to prevent cheating from happening in the first place. State your expectations at the beginning of the class and before the exam.


Make sure your students know the penalties for academic dishonesty.;
, Arrange desks in the room to spread out students if possible. Alternately, assign seats to students so that they do not sit at their usual desk. Students will not be able to sit next to a friend with whom they plan to cheat.


Ask students to store backpacks, books, or binders under their chairs.
 If your test environment is a large space, such as an auditorium, consider having an assistant or two help you monitor the students during the exam. These individuals can roam around the room and cover more ground than a single person can.
 Look at each student as he or she comes through the door and say hello. Keep an eye on students who look fidgety or nervous.


Glance at their arms, hands and hats to make sure there aren’t any notes written on those areas. Be wary of students who are constantly pulling their long sleeves down to cover more of their arms.
Keep in mind that many students are anxious when they come into an exam. Don’t automatically assume that someone is cheating because he looks nervous.

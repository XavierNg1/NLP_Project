 Start with a pitching wedge or 9 iron.;
, You will notice the dimples from the golf ball on the impact tape.
 This means that you need to line the ball up between the middle of the club head and the heel of the club head. Keep inching the club head forward or back, depending where your mark is on the impact tape. If the ball mark is closer to the toe of the club, you need to line up somewhere between the middle of the club head and the toe.
 This lets you get a clean picture of where you are impacting the tape.

 Sections are the easiest way to ensure you don't miss any strands with your flat iron.The thicker the hair, the more layers you'll want to section. Those with very thick hair can divide hair into four, five or six layers. Extra sections are added in the same method described below, but you will divide your head into four, five or six layers instead of three.
 Place your thumbs behind your ears and pull the hair up, gliding your thumbs across the back of your head until they meet in the middle. Twist and clip the section to create the top layer.
 Scoop up the remaining loose hair above your ears into a single section. Secure the layer with a hair tie or butterfly clip.
 The layer just above the nape of your neck will be first section you straighten.
 Begin with the bottom layer and smooth straightener from about a half-inch away from your scalp steadily down your hair shaft.When the bottom layer is finished, continue separating small sections of hair in the middle layer. Smooth hair with the flat iron from a half-inch away from your scalp down the hair shaft.
Lift hair from your scalp when straightening the top layer. After separating small sections of your top layer of hair, place the flat iron as close to your roots as possible. Press the iron firmly closed and draw it down the hair shaft outward from your head.
For pin-straight, divide each layer into small sections. Glide the straightener only a few times over each section before moving along.If your prefer smoother hair, divide it into larger sections. Then clamp the flat iron tightly and run it over each part slowly, ensuring the heat penetrates each section but with less direct contact.

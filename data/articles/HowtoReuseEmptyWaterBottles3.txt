 First, choose a design you would like to create. Then, collect bottle caps. Most water bottle caps are white, so you can paint them different colors to have variety. The last step will be to glue the caps to a large sheet of paper. Hang the design where you wish for a colorful decoration., This is a great way to decorate your home, and it also makes for a fantastic DIY gift. To create a flower vase, cut off the top part of the bottle with a utility knife. Glue colorful wrapping paper, white paper, or felt to the bottom half. Decorate the bottom with stickers, markers, or other supplies if you wish. Fill the bottle up with water and place flowers inside.
 These can illuminate your home or backyard in fun ways and are relatively easy to create. To make these, simply cut off the bottom portions of several (5-10) empty 1 liter water bottles with scissors or a utility knife. Paint the top halves of the bottles with acrylic or transparent glass paint or decorate with washi tape in a design of your choice. Remove the caps and slip the bulbs of string lights into the bottle openings, one bulb per bottle. Using the knife, poke a small hole near the opening and pass craft wire through it. Twist the craft wire with the string light wire to hold the light in place.

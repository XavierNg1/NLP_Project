 In the event you have decided to forego eyeliner, eyeshadow is a great option! Try to stick to neutral colors, you don't want contrast to make your look too edgy. The lightest shade that matches your skin tone is a choice to consider.
 You'll need an applicator for this task, and a large eyeshadow brush is the best option available. Using your eyeshadow tool, cover each lid evenly with the best tone for your skin.
 This time you'll want to choose a shade barely lighter than your skin color. Using a fresh applicator, blend these across your lid in the direction of the other color to create as natural a gradient as possible.
 Check to see whether your eyeliner is the same thickness all the way along your in a mirror.

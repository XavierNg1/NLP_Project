, It's very important that you get your chores done. We all know that if your parents expect you to handle some kind of chore and you don't, they won't be very happy with you.
 We all hate it, but it's the number one way to be prepared for school.


Check the deadlines for your homework and finish the ones with the closest deadline first. You could spread out the other assignments in such a way that you take full advantage of the time you have. For instance if you have a week to finish a book report, you could prepare an outline on day one. Day two could be for research at the library. Day three could be for putting together the first draft. And so on.
 Your brain cannot stay focused for more than that. So, study well for an hour and take a break- have a snack, take a walk or do some stretches.
 It's the best way to relax! Make it a nice, hot shower.Also, don't let anything distract you.
 No one likes smelly breath or messy hair!

, If you set it out early you won't need to spend 20 minutes finding something in the morning.
 This way you won't need to freak out in the morning looking for the homework you left on the counter.
 Sleep is so very, very important!

,, Do NOT skip breakfast. Ever. A good, full breakfast will give you an energy boost that will help you get through your day.

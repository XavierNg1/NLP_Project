 White vinegar or apple cider vinegar can be mixed with baking soda and dishwashing soap, instead of hydrogen peroxide. This may be less effective, but does not have the risk of bleaching your dog's fur. Follow the instructions for hydrogen peroxide above, except where noted below:


Vinegar will fizz immediately when mixed with baking soda, and quickly break apart. You may wish to rub the baking soda into the dog's fur, then pour on the vinegar.
 Massaging with scented pet shampoo will not remove the skunk oil permanently, but it may hide it temporarily. It is only useful as a short-term solution, unless you are willing to reapply it regularly. Skunk odor can take weeks to dissipate naturally, and may rub off onto clothing and furniture, so this is not recommended as a long-term solution.


Tomato juice is not significantly more effective than scented shampoo, makes a mess, and can even stain your dog's fur slightly.Despite its popularity as a home remedy, it is not a good solution to skunk odor.
 Most of the scent may be trapped in the dog's fur, especially if it is long and the spray wasn't directly aimed at the dog. Trim the fur yourself or take the dog to a dog groomer who's willing to work around the smell of skunk.

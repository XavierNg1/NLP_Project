 For example, if you have .WMA (Windows Media Audio) files you’d like to convert to Mp3, you’ll need a tool that supports both file types.


Freemake is free and incredibly easy to use.Visit their site and click “Free Download.” Choose a location you’ll remember and save the installer. Once the download is complete, double-click the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
Audacity is popular and free, but not for beginners.Audacity converts many types of audio for free, but you’ll need to install plugins to convert to and from WMA. Download the installer, the LAME MP3 encoder, and the FFmpeg import/export. Install them in that order.
Try an online tool. If you’re just working with one or two files, an online audio converter may be all you need. Sites like http://www.media.io and http://www.online-convert.com are free and popular.
 If you installed software like Freemake or Audacity, open the software and then find the audio file by clicking “Audio” or “File,” then “Open.” If you’re using a web tool, find a button that says something like “upload” or “add file” and select the file.
 In Audacity, go to “File,” then “Export” to choose a format. In Freemake and most online tools, click the file type in the list (such as .Mp3 or .WMA).
 Click “Convert” or “Export” to begin the conversion. Depending on the speed of your computer and the size of the file, this can take a few minutes. Most tools will ask where you want to save the new file, so select a location. Once the conversion is done, open the file in your desired media player and enjoy.

 There are many load boards on the internet, you just have to decide which one is right for you. There are some free load boards available, however, many of them do not have a wide selection of loads. Most paid load boards cost less than $20/month and have tons of loads available in almost all 50 states. A simple search on Google will return many results for load boards. Do some research and find the one that fits your needs.;
, You'll need your basic information (name, address, email address, phone number) as well as a credit card for payment if you are using a paid board.
 If you'd like people with loads to find you, the best thing you can do is post your truck to the load board. You'll post the type of truck, your location, how far you want to drive, and how much space you have to the load board. This will enable those with loads to search you out.
 You can search for loads by location, distance, and size. By searching for loads you become your own boss by choosing how far you drive and how much you carry.

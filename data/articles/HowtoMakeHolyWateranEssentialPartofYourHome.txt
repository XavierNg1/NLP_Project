 They are sold in religious stores, or you can make your own by using a flat seashell. Seashells have been used as a symbol of baptism for centuries.;
, Some religious hospitals also have a container of holy water in their chapel. If you do not see a container of holy water in the church sanctuary, don't be afraid to ask the priest about it, he will show you where it is located. Be sure to bring a bottle or small container to hold the holy water.
 Then, pour some holy water into the holders. You don't need to overfill. By placing a thin sponge in the font, you can delay the evaporation of the holy water.
 Explain that you believe that holy water forgives the common sins. Tell them that whenever they see a holy water holder, they should dip their finger in the water, make the sign of the cross with the wet finger, and leave. Tell them that they won't have to spend a lot of time in purgatory.

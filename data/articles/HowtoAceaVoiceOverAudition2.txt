 If you got the script beforehand, great. You should have already studied and practiced it. If you're seeing the script for the first time, take a couple minutes to read through it. Find the main message. With that message in mind, think about how you want to deliver the script. Practice reading out loud if you can.
 Besides the high stress of auditioning for a job, a lot of companies will purposely heckle you to see how to respond under pressure. Stay cool, calm, and collected, and follow any directions you are given, even if you think you know better.

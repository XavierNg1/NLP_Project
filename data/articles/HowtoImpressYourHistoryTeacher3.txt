 History teachers often have specific time periods or historical figures they are especially fond of, or types of situations they are drawn to. You can tell what these are by noticing what they most focus on in their lectures. Have a question or two ready to ask, in case there is a dead space in the class discussion. Your teacher will see that you've done the reading and put some thought into the material.


Your teachers will be grateful for your help in keeping the conversation going – those dead spaces are as boring for them as they are for the rest of the class.
Your teachers will either think you're interested in the same things they are (win), or they will give you props for paying close enough attention to figure out what they like most...either way, it's a win for you.
 To properly study history, it's vitally important to stay caught up on the reading – you need to understand each important historical event before you can understand why the next incident occurred. If there is anything you're confused about, or want to learn more about, you can ask your teacher if he or she has any suggestions for further reading. Your teacher will be impressed that you are looking ahead to the next lesson.
 There are tons of informational podcasts out there that put an entertaining spin on history, like “Stuff You Missed in History Class” or the BBC's “Rex Factor.” Search for episodes about specific historical periods or events that you will be covering in class, and pick up some obscure fun facts to drop into the class discussion.

Hedges that have recently been planted, such as within the previous two months, require only generalized shaping.
Use a large pair of pruning shears to cut the hedges down to a height of approximately 6 inches (15.24 centimeters). Don't worry about making sure that the tops of the hedges are perfectly aligned at this time, just that they have been adequately trimmed.;

This can be done simply by using a yardstick or measuring tape. Determine the distance from the base of the hedges to their highest point.



In the spring following the first year of growth by the hedges, greater amounts of shaping must be done. Review the height of the plants, and trim them down to half their current size. This can be done without focusing a great deal on symmetry.
Make sure that this process has been completed before the hedges begin blossoming.
In addition, during the second year of growth, the sides of the hedges can be shaped lightly. Using a large pair of shears, trim growth that is sticking out from the sides of the hedge. Focus most of your attention to especially deviant branches and leaves, being carefully to avoid performing excessive amounts of trimming.



At the start of the third growing season, repeat the process described above, trimming the hedges to half their starting height. Greater amounts of shaping on the sides of the hedges may be required at this time.

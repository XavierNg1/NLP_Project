 Be surprised at the new graphics and wordings, and artistic design. Comic books as well as all graphic novels have drastically changed, and are no longer just for the young.;
, It is a nice place to visit, have lunch before or after, and make a day of it. Look at the shelves for the latest comics, as well as some of the older ones.
 Ask a staff member to show you the latest comics, or to recommend the best ones, or the older versions as opposed to the latest to compare the changes made.
 Instead of books on the shelf, expect to find an assortment of comic books and graphic novels. See the Tips below for suggestions on matching your areas of interest with specific comics and graphic novels.
 In fact, if you have an idea for a story, you can go to the library, and find a book on How to Make a Comic Book and try to make your own.
 Each comic shop has a culture and feel all its own. If you feel like the shop you chose first is too small, too big, too dusty, too dark, try a different one. If the staff isn't helpful, realize that the culture of a different shop's staff might suit you better. Don't judge all comic shops on one experience, they're all as different as the books they carry.

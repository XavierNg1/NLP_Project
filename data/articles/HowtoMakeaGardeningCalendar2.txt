 For beginning gardeners, a wall calendar with blocks for each day may serve as an acceptable gardening calendar format. Purchase a wall calendar or make your own using photographs of seasonal plants.
 Experienced gardeners recommend using a 3-ring notebook to record gardening plans and track activities. The notebook provides flexibility to create sections as applicable to your garden.


Organize gardening tasks monthly. Most gardening notebooks including a page for each month of the year, with a list of tasks and associated dates for gardening chores applicable to each month. You also may organize gardening tasks weekly if you choose a more detailed approach.
Include garden plans. If you design garden plans on graph paper (or any other type of paper), keep the garden plans in your notebook. Depending on your gardening needs, you may include a master plan or individual garden sketches.
Add an inspiration section. Include photographs or articles featuring ideas you would like to implement in your garden.
Include a gardening expense report. Track money spent on seeds, plants, soil, fertilizer and other gardening supplies. This will help you create monthly and annual gardening budgets.

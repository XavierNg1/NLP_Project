 Follow the instructions on the dye box. You should have a tube of dye that is either mixed with another substance or applied directly to your hair.
 Using the same technique you used to apply the bleach, apply the dye to your hair section by section, making sure each strand gets completely covered. Place the plastic cap that came with your dyeing kit over your hair and wait for the dye to work.
 After the amount of time specified on your package of dye has elapsed, rinse out the dye with warm water until the water runs clear. Use the purple shampoo to wash your hair, then use conditioner.
 For the next few weeks, limit your use of heat styling tools and products that contain chemicals. The bleaching and dyeing process is hard on your hair and it needs time to recover.


Instead of blow drying your hair, pat it dry with a towel and let it finish air drying.
You can create curls or style your hair straight without using heat.

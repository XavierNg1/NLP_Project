 Popcorn can actually be a relatively healthy snack when made at home. Movie theater popcorn, however, is notorious for extra calories from things like butter and oil. If you want to go healthy at the movie theater, ask for a small popcorn without butter.Serving sizes at movie theaters tend to be large, so you may be surprised how big a small is. Splitting your popcorn with a friend can help you cut back on calories.
If you're really watching what you consume, ask about how the popcorn is prepared. The healthiest popcorn will be prepared with heart healthy canola oil rather than things like coconut oil.
 While pretzels are not necessarily low calorie, they do come with less calories than things like popcorn and nachos. Movie theater pretzels, or pretzel bites, tend to have somewhere between 300 and 500 calories in a serving. If you love pretzels, this may save you some calories if you choose a pretzel over popcorn.In general, dipping sauces should be avoided as they contain a lot of calories. However, if you really want a dipping sauce, go for mustard over cheese-based sauces. Mustard only contains about 5 calories per serving., While hotdogs are not a health food, they do have some protein. This can make you full faster, preventing overindulgence. Also, hotdogs are pretty low calorie. They usually only contain about 210 calories in a serving.Make sure to watch what you add to your snack. Adding things like nacho cheese or chili will send calories from hotdogs skyrocketing.
 Nachos are generally the worst treat at a movie theater. Nachos can contain as much as 900 calories and tend to be very high in fat. While a serving of nachos may be tempting, it's not the treat for you if you're looking for healthy movie snacks., If you want a healthy snack, ask about the theater's policy regarding outside food. Some theaters allow you to bring in food from home. If it's not allowed, see if you can sneak in some treats from home. You may be able to bring in some healthy treats not offered at a theater. Ideas include:Vegetables, such as carrot sticks
100-calorie bags of popcorn
Lower calorie pretzels
Low-fat string cheese

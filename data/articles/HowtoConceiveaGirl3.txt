 Dr. Ronald Ericsson based his gender selection method on the idea that X-sperm (female sperm) swim slower than Y-sperm. Sperm are deposited into a column with albumin, a glue-like substance, and start swimming down the column. After a while, the idea is that the Y-sperm will have traveled further down the column than the X-sperm, and X-enriched sperm can be isolated. The X-enriched sperm are then used to inseminate the mother.
 Check with your local fertility doctor about the Ericsson method, and whether they know any practitioners. Although many fertility doctors don't support the Ericsson method because it isn't backed up by widespread scientific support, you should be able to find a practitioner.
 Although this isn't cheap, it's far cheaper than IVF and methods like MicroSort.

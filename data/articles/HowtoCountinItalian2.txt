, Use numbers from one two nine and the word "cento."


One-hundred : Uno cento, (rarely is used; just cento).
Two-hundred : Due cento.
Three-hundred : Tre cento, and so on.
Remember cento does not need to become plural.
 (/mil-le/)
One-thousand : Uno mille, (rarely is used; just mille).
Two-thousand : duemila. (mila : /mi-la/)
Three-thousand : tremila, and so on.
Note that mille, in contrast to cento, becomes plural as mila.


Million : Un milione,

segmented as un-milion-e; pronounced as oon-milly-oh-neh. (/un-mi-ljo-ne/)
Please note, "milione" always comes with its article "un" when one million is involved.



Remember two cardinals "uno" and "otto" as they begin with a vowel.
Any other number is built by attaching the larger number and then the smaller number; hence,

Forty-three is quarantatre.
Seventy-five is settantacinque.
Hundred and ninety-six is centonovantasei.
Four-hundred and twenty-five is quattrocentoventicinque.
Note that in Italian they attach them; in contrast to English that they put a hyphen.


If smaller number is uno or otto, drop the last letter of the larger number (I put a vertical bar | to show the drop); hence,

Thirty-one is trentuno (trent|uno).
Fifty-eight is cinquantotto (cinquant|otto).
Hundred and one is centuno (cent|uno).
Two-thousand and eight-hundred and sixty-four is duomilottocentosessantaquattro (duomil|ottocentosessantaquattro).
Two-thousand and eight hundred and sixty-one is duomilottocentosessantuno (duomil|ottocentosessant|uno).

 It doesn't have to be anything really specific, but a successful event tends to have a consistent feeling throughout. Choose a theme that is easy to plan and decorate. Everything should be consistent with the theme.


You can usually hire someone that will decorate your wedding, but it can be expensive to do so.
Visit the venue and take pictures of how the area looks. You may want to measure the dimensions of the room or area, to allow you to plan where you want everything go and to know if you have enough space.
As part of the theme, research the flowers you want at the wedding. Find out if they're available during the time of your wedding or if they're out of season (the costs of flying them in can be very high). Finalize flowers around four months ahead of the wedding date.
Match decorations to the color theme for best overall appearance.
 Research into the design of your wedding invitations when you still have around 10 months to go, and work on purchasing or ordering their printing when there are about six months to go. Leave plenty of time if you're making your own and always have lots of spares, as making a mistake now and then in writing or making them is inevitable.


Be creative; you can make your own and add a personal touch or go to a professional.
Send out invitations around two months prior to the wedding; this should be sufficient time if you've already sounded out your guests and sent them "save the date" cards. (If Jewish, make sure to get kippots made.)
Make wedding programs. As with the invitations, you can you have your programs professionally printed or make your own. Itâ€™s not recommended that you print your programs much more than a week in advance in case there are any unexpected changes, such as changes in ushers or candle lighters. If possible, have your officiant proofread the ceremony portion of the program.

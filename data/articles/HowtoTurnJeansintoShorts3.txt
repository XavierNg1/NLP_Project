 If you want to prevent excess fraying, or if you prefer not to have a line of fringe around the bottom of the shorts, you'll need to hem the shorts to prevent the fabric from unweaving.


Fold the edges under one-fourth of an inch and use a sewing machine to hem the shorts.
If you don't have a sewing machine, fold the the edges under one-fourth of an inch and sew around the edge of the shorts by hand.
 If you want to cuff the shorts, you should still stitch around the edge to prevent them from fraying too much.


Use a sewing machine to stitch around the edge of both legs, or stitch them by hand.
Fold the shorts up, then fold them up again to create a cuff.
Use an iron to press the cuffs into place.
If you want to keep the shorts permanently cuffed at the same length, you can stitch up the side of the cuffs to hold them in place.
 If you're going for the classic fringe look, it's time to throw your shorts in the wash. Put them through the regular wash and dry cycle to produce a nice line of fringe.









If you want more fringe, repeat the wash and dry cycle.
If you want to prevent the shorts from fraying too much, wash and dry until the shorts have the desired amount of fringe, then stitch around the legs right above where the fringe meets the intact denim.

 Many local colleges allow people to enroll in single classes, but if you don’t want to go that route there are plenty of private art schools around. Look for one in your area. This will help you regiment your time.
 Try reaching out to local art teachers at colleges and high schools. They might have some free time and be willing to tutor you if you offer them a decent salary. Even if you only meet with them once a week for an hour they can help you focus your practice for the rest of the week. They’ll be able to track your progress better than you can alone too.
 Many galleries and museums have free art classes. You won’t have as personalized an experience but it won’t cost you any money either. You often get to hang out in a museum at night and try to draw their exhibits too, which is pretty cool.

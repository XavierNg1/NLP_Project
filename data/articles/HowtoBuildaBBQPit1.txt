 It’s important to have a great location for your BBQ pit. You don’t want it too far away from your house so you have to carry all the food and utensils too far, but you don’t want to put it somewhere where the smoke will blow straight into your or your neighbour’s house.More important than convenience elements, however, are the safety factors which you should bear in mind.









Be sure you place it away from overhanging trees, buildings and fences which could be damaged by the smoke or catch fire.If you are building it on the surface, it should be placed on level ground.;
, There are a huge variety of potential barbeque pits, and you can even be creative in your design. Find one you like and you have the right space for. Check you can afford all the materials and you have the time to work on it. There’s nothing worse than leaving something half-finished.









Rope in a few friends or family members to help, especially if they are quite good with their hands. You can pay them back with grilled meat.
 Barbecue pit plans vary from the very simple, to the very complicated and ornate. If you are building it from scratch, you can find some plans to follow on the internet. If you are not so experienced in building, it might be a good idea to start off with a relatively simple plan. You can lay it out on the ground to get a clear picture of the size and shape.








A rectangular shape with sides that reach up to around waist-height is fine.
You can add more elements, such as a cooling rack, or a smoker.

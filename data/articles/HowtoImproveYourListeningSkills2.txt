 It can be tempting to finish someone's sentences when you are convinced you know what they are going to say next– especially when you don't have a lot of time. But most of the time, you'll only be expressing your own train of thought, and the speaker will become frustrated because you aren't letting them express themselves., Often, when people want to talk about a problem, they are looking for support more than anything else. If you impose your own solutions without being asked, or give advice when it wasn't asked for, it will seem as if you don't trust them to figure it out for themselves., Any time you interrupt someone when they are speaking, it comes across as rude and thoughtless. Interrupting tells the speaker that you think your ideas are more important or interesting than theirs, and that you don't have time for them or care what they think., If someone is telling you a story about something that happened to them, don't counter it with a similar anecdote from your own life. It will come across as boastful, which most people find extremely unattractive. It will also appear that you are more interested in “winning” the conversation than learning more about the other person.If someone is talking about their recent vacation, it's fine to mention that you've been there and really enjoyed it. But don't tell stories about your time there – allow the speaker to remain the center of attention.
At all costs, try to avoid mentioning how much money you earn or how much you have saved or invested. Especially if you're more successful than the speaker.
 Be careful when listening not to abruptly change the topic of conversation. It is natural to want to move away from an uncomfortable topic of conversation, but it shows a lack of respect for the speaker.

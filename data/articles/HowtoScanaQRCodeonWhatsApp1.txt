 You'll see a black-and-white box in the middle of the page; this is the QR code.


If you're using the WhatsApp desktop version instead, you'll see this code the first time you open the program.;
, It's a green app with a white phone icon inside of a white speech bubble outline.


If you haven't yet set up WhatsApp, do so before continuing.
 It's in the bottom-right corner of the screen.


If WhatsApp opens to a conversation, first tap the "Back" button in the top-left corner of the screen.
 You'll see this option near the top of the page, below your profile name and picture.
 Your iPhone's screen should be facing you, while the camera should be facing the QR code on your computer.


If you've previously scanned a QR code with WhatsApp, you will need to first tap Scan QR Code near the bottom of the screen to invoke the camera.
 If your camera doesn't acknowledge the QR code right away, try moving your iPhone closer to the screen.


Once the code scans, the WhatsApp web page will display your WhatsApp messages.

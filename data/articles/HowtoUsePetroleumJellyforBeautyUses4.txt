 If you’re tired of your favorite fragrance fading before the end of the day, dab a very small amount of petroleum jelly on the inside of your wrists, behind your ears, and anywhere else that you normally apply perfume. When you spray the fragrance over the areas, it will cling to the jelly so it lasts longer., If you’re having a bad hair day, petroleum jelly can help smooth flyaway hair and disguise split ends. Tame flyaways by placing a pinch of the jelly in your palm, rubbing it between your hands, and smoothing it over your hair. For fried-looking ends, dab a very small amount on your fingers and run it over the ends to smooth them.Be careful not to go overboard when using petroleum jelly on your hair. If you apply too much, your locks can wind up looking greasy and limp.
 If you find yourself frustrated with nail polish bottles that won’t open because of dried polish along the rim, petroleum jelly is the answer. Before you close the bottle after polishing your nails, spread a small amount of the jelly along the rim. The bottle will open easily the next time you use it.

 It is important that your employees or colleagues know to expect such a meeting in the near future. This will get their minds working on the topic and will provide for a much more productive session.


Perhaps issue some background materials on what SWOT is all about, along with some suggestions for individual preparation. It also helps to make it clear what is hoped for in terms of individual participation.;
, Use a large flip-chart to make a chart with four squares - like a tic-tac-toe chart, but 2 x 2 instead of 3 x 3.


Label the top left square “Strengths”
Label the top right square “Weaknesses”
Label the bottom left square “Opportunities"
Label the bottom right square “Threats”.
 Be sure to make it clear that the top two squares (Strengths, Weaknesses) focus in the “Internal” aspects of your organization or company. The bottom two squares focus on “External” elements; things that are not directly under your control.
 This step is completely optional but it can be helpful to guide the process, especially for beginners. You can choose to create individual SWOT charts for employees to use in the brainstorming session explained below, or you can simply have them bring their own paper and write it out themselves.

, A small amount will work, enough to make an effective paste with the powder. Combine the two ingredients with a whisk.
 The heat will open up the pores on your hair, which will let your mixture better sap the unwanted color.
 You can apply it with your hands. Cover the entire affected area; if you fail to apply it evenly, you might wind up with an interesting pattern in your hair.
 Cover your hair with a shower cap if necessary. After an hour has passed, rinse the paste from your hair with cool water.


Moisturize thoroughly with conditioner if your hair feels dry after youâ€™ve washed the paste out.

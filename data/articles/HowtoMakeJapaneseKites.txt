The top angle should be approximately 150 degrees and its sides about 16 inches (40.64 cm) long. The bottom sides should be about 20 inches (50.8 cm) long.;

The front side of washi paper is slippery and the thin fibers tend to soak ink in quickly. Use colorful markers or lightweight paints to decorate.

Do not fold the kite tightly; you are simply finding the center line.


The vertical spar should be approximately 25 inches (63.5 cm). The two diagonal spars should be approximately 20 inches.


Position the center spar on the faintly folded middle line.
Place the first diagonal spar so that it crosses the center spar 2 inches (5.08 cm) from the top. It should extend past the center spar about halfway to the right. The diagonal spar should hang over the left edge about 1 inch (2.54 cm). Do the same for the other diagonal spar but on the other side. The two diagonal spars should meet at the same point in the center.
, Press firmly with your fingers until the glue dries.,

Punch out two small holes with a toothpick on either side of the center spar one-third of the way down the kite.
Create another two holes parallel to the first two on either side of the center spar one-third of the way up from the bottom of the kite.
Thread kite string into the top left hole, starting from the back. Thread that same string trough the top right hole, starting from the front.
Repeat this process with the bottom two holes using the other end of the kite string.
Tie a new piece of string to the top of the center spar to the bottom. This is the bow line.
Wrap the bow line tightly until the kite begins to bend in the middle.
Collect the lines of string together and knot them.

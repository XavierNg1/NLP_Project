 Cut it about a quarter way from the top. This top is to be the hat, the rest is to make the body. Hence, the body part should be much more substantial than the hat part.
, This is to make Santa's bearded face.
 Do this gently, as you don't want to squash down the hat. Pipe a much smaller bit of whipped cream at the very top of the hat, to form a pompom.
 These are the buttons.
 Place just under the hat in the whipped cream face, where eyes should go. Alternatively, place two small chocolate chips there.
 The finished product should be a little strawberry Santa. Repeat for each of the strawberries you're turning into Santas.
 Place in the refrigerator until needed but if uncovered, don't leave in there more than one to two hours, or they may start to take on fridge odors and won't taste as nice.

 College brings along all kinds of new challenges, especially in your first year. You may suddenly be very busy with classes, social activities, and studying. But, you will need to prioritize your significant other and make sure you give them an appropriate amount of time and attention.


Even though it’s important to give your boyfriend or girlfriend your attention, it will need to be a balance. You are obviously in college because you want to succeed in school, so make sure you are giving the right amount of time to all of your academic responsibilities.Sometimes, combining the priorities of school and a significant other can work, too—try having study dates, or doing homework together.;
, Similarly to making your significant other a priority and making time for them, you need to make sure you make time for yourself.


Taking time for yourself might seem like an easy thing to do, but you might find out it can be difficult! If you are having trouble making time for yourself, put it in your planner or on your calendar, and make sure not to schedule anything else during that time.
 If you go to the same school, or even take some of the same classes, the two of you might begin to feel a little overwhelmed from too much time together. Make sure to pencil some alone time into your schedule., Talk to each other honestly and openly. Do not harbor any secrets or grievances. These omissions can end up weakening your bond, especially when they finally come out.


Simply talking isn’t necessarily good communication. Make sure you are really listening to your significant other rather than just waiting for your turn to speak.An advantage of living near your boyfriend or girlfriend through college is that when you communicate with them, you can also read into their body language. For example, folded arms might indicate defensiveness, while a lack of making eye contact might signal disinterest or even shame.

 If your SI joint pain is severe, your doctor may suggest an SI joint injection. It will provide immediate pain relief. Your doctor will inject an anesthetic and anti-inflammatory medication in the area, helping to reduce inflammation of the joint and any pain.Your doctor may suggest that you start a physical therapy program right after the injection has been done. The injection will also allow you to resume your normal activities.
 You may benefit from a brace or a support for your SI joint so it can be stabilized and stay in place. Your doctor may suggest that you use an orthotic or brace, such as a wide belt, around your waist to keep the SI joint in place.Once the SI joint is less inflamed, you may be able to loosen the orthotic. Your doctor may schedule follow up appointments with you to ensure the brace or support is working.
 Your doctor may suggest that you get a referral for a chiropractor to help adjust your SI joint in a safe, effective way. The chiropractor can help to adjust your SI joint and make it more mobile using several methods or techniques.You should only go to a chiropractor that has been referred to you by your doctor, as you do not want to make your SI joint worse by going to an inexperienced chiropractor.
 Surgery should be considered an absolute last resort for SI pain. However, if your pain has not been properly managed or relieved by other methods, surgical intervention may be necessary.

Let your doctor know about the pain you experience, as well as what types of pain management you have tried. This will help them better assess whether surgery is the right option for you.

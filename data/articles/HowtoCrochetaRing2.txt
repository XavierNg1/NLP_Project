 Attach the yarn to the crochet hook using a slip knot, then work one chain stitch from the loop., Work 12 single crochets into the center of the chain you just created.

Join the last single crochet to the top of the first using a slip stitch.
Completing this step should form a tight circle that will act as the foundation round.
 Chain one. Double crochet once into the stitch at the base of chain and the stitch that follows, completing one decrease.

Chain three.
Double crochet once into the next two stitches, completing another decrease. Chain three.

Repeat this pattern across the remaining stitches in the round.


Join the last chain to the top of the first completed double crochet using a slip stitch.
 Chain three, then slip stitch once into the first stitch of this chain. Slip stitch once more into the first chain-three space.

Chain three, then slip stitch once into the first chain.
Slip stitch once into the next double crochet. Chain three, slip stitch once into the first of those chains, then slip stitch once into the next chain-three space. Chain three and slip stitch once into the first of these chains.

Repeat this pattern around the rest of the round.


Join the last stitch of this round with the first using one slip stitch.
 Work a chain long enough to wrap around your finger. Connect the last stitch of this chain to the opposite side of the picot decoration using a slip stitch.

The exact number of chains will vary depending on the size of your finger, so you'll need to check the length against your finger before completing the band.
When joining the band to the decoration, slip stitch into the slip-stitch space in between picots on the opposite side of the ring.
 Cut the yarn, leaving 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of excess. Pull this excess yarn through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

Using a tapestry needle, weave the excess ends into the stitches.
This step completes the project; your ring should be ready to wear.

 Corporations may choose illustrative case study method to show what has been done for a client; schools, educators and students may select cumulative or critical case study method and legal teams may demonstrate exploratory (investigative) case study method as a way to provide factual evidence.


Whatever case study method you're employing, your purpose is to thoroughly analyze a situation (or "case") which could reveal factors or information otherwise ignored or unknown. These can be written about companies, whole countries, or even individuals. What's more, these can be written on more abstract things, like programs or practices. Really, if you can dream it, you can write a case study about it.;
, Once you've picked your angle, you need to determine what your research will be about and where it will take place (your case site). What have you talked about in class? Have you caught yourself coming up with questions during your reading?


Start your research at the library and/or on the Internet to begin delving into a specific problem. Once you've narrowed down your search to a specific problem, find as much about it as you can from a variety of different sources. Look up information in books, journals, DVDs, websites, magazines, newspapers, etc. As you go through each one, take adequate notes so you can find the info later on!, Talk to your professors, go to the library, surf the web until your bum falls asleep. You don't want to replicate the research that has already been done.


Find out what has been written before, and read the important articles about your case's situation . When you do this, you may find there is an existing problem that needs solution, or you may find that you have to come up with an interesting idea that might or might not work in your case situation.
Review sample case studies that are similar in style and scope to get an idea of composition and format, too.

 You could use the same towels you used to buff and clean the exterior of the windshield in order to avoid going through your towels too quickly.
 Starting in the upper-left corner of the passenger’s side, move the scrub pad down the windshield in parallel rows, working your way to the left (driver’s) side. You’ll have to stop after cleaning the first half of the windshield to apply glass cleaner to the driver’s side.


Remain in the passenger seat or lean into the car from the passenger’s side door to avoid bumping or leaning on the steering wheel while cleaning.
 Just as you did on the passenger’s side of the windshield, move the scrub pad from top to bottom until the entire surface of the interior windshield has been scrubbed clean. When you’re finished, use a dry microfiber towel to go over the entire surface of the windshield to ensure you didn’t leave any cleaning liquid behind. Move your hand around the entire surface of the windshield in a small, tight circle.

 Goth? A smarty-pants? A Thespian?;
, What do you wear most often? Fish out your favorites. Use these clothes as a template for what else you should buy.
 Buy clothes similar to the ones you love. Make sure nothing has curse words or innuendos. Buy some nice khaki and black pants. Do you love that blue tee? Then buy a professional shirt in the same shade. 'Upgrade' the clothes you have by changing the cut or style. Don't be afraid to buy fitted clothes.
 For girls, try nice jewelry in a single shade and neat fingernails. If you wear glasses, keep them clean and simple - you probably shouldn't buy the hot pink cat frames.
 Try out different ideas until you find something you like. Don't think that there's just one way to look smart/neat because that isn't true. If something isn't you then try something else.
 If you're trying to look smart then plain, well fitting clothes work best. Slogans, logos, faded clothes, rips and "distressed" fabrics tend to edge away from the smart look.
 Have a look through the magazines and books at the hairdressers when you go, or have a look on the internet to find something you like. If you want to make a good impression then try to keep your hair from falling over your face too much (if you have a style that does this then just clip it back, you don't need to get it cut if you like it!) as hiding your face will make people feel wary as they can't see your expression. How you style your hair will depend on your hair type, but as a general rule avoid anything which looks untidy and you should be okay.
 Large quantities of make-up doesn't usually look smart, once again this is simply a case of looking through magazines and finding a look you like but if you're not sure where to start then try some mascara, natural (minimal) foundation (if you need it)and lip gloss.
 Keep tattoos small and discreet. Keep body piercings to the ears and maybe belly button. Remember that you might want to cover these piercings and tattoos up someday!

 Tap the Search button in the upper-right corner of the screen, or click the search bar if you are using Chrome. You can search for messages based on a variety of different criteria.;
, Enter an email address to find all of the messages you have received from that address. You can enter a partial email address if you can't remember the whole thing.
 Enter a name to find messages that you have received from a specific person.
 Type keywords to search through subject lines and message bodies to find matching messages.
 You can use operators such as older_than and newer_than. You can search by days, months, and years. For example older_than:6m will search for emails that are over six months old. newer_than:3d will show all of the messages you have received in the last three days.
 You can use the larger and smaller operators to search for messages above or below a certain size. For example, larger:2m will look for messages that are larger than 2 megabytes in size.
 Use multiple search operators to narrow down your results. You can combine an email address search with a date modifier, or a keyword search with a person's name.


You can use the OR operator to search for two (or more) different search terms at once.
You can use the - operator to exclude terms from your search results. For example, searching for date -movie will search for anything that matches "date" but doesn't contain the word "movie".
You can use " " to search for exact phrases.
You can use + to search for exact terms. For example, +movie will return anything matching "movie", but not "movies".

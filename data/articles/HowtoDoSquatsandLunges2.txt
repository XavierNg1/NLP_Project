The most important thing with squats is to have the correct form, so you shouldn't attempt weighted squats until you can perform body weight squats with perfect form.
Start with a low weight — maybe just using the bar (which weighs 45lbs) — and slowly build yourself up to heavier weights as your squat technique and muscle strength improves.,


Set up the squat rack so the bar is slightly below shoulder level. Position the safety bars so they are low enough to allow you to squat down fully with the bar on your shoulders.
When you're ready, duck under the bar and grip it widely with your palms facing forward. Rest the bar across your upper back (not your neck). If this feels uncomfortable for you, try using a bar pad.



Place your feet slightly wider than a shoulder width apart, with your toes pointing slightly outwards.
Hinge your hips and push your butt backwards until your hamstrings are parallel with the floor.
Keep your chest up, your shoulders back and your eyes looking straight ahead.
Remember to keep your back straight — this is especially important when you are squatting with heavy weights.
Push out of the squat with your heels and don't let your knees cave in towards the center. If this happens, you may need to reduce your weight.



Breathing deeply is very important when squatting heavy weights. If you hold your breath you can become dizzy, nauseous or even black out.
Take a deep breath in as you squat down and exhale powerfully as you rise up. Maintaining this breathing pattern will give you the energy you need to keep going.
If you're pushing yourself to get another few repetitions, don't be afraid to pause between repetitions to take a couple of deep breaths.

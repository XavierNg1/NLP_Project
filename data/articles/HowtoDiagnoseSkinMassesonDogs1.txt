 Start by using clean hands to gently feel around the skin mass. The skin mass may be located on your dog’s belly or trunk, though they can appear anywhere on your dog’s body. Note if the skin mass feels soft and moveable under the skin. If this is the case, the skin mass may be a buildup of fatty tissue, known as a lipoma, which is not life threatening. If the skin mass feels hard and does not move with your touch, it may be a tumor.Regardless of how the skin mass feels, you should get it examined by a vet to confirm it is not a tumor. Doing the feel test is not a definitive way to diagnosis the skin mass.;
, If the skin mass is one centimeter or larger in size, you should get it checked by your vet. One centimeter is about the size of a pea.If your dog has multiple skin masses that are the size of a pea or larger, take her to the vet right away.
 If you notice a very small skin mass on your dog, keep an eye on it and pay attention to how it develops over the next month. If the mass appears to be growing or spreading, you should bring your dog to the vet for a diagnosis. You should also note if the mass does not go away after a few weeks, as this could be a sign of a serious medical issue.Pay attention to how the skin mass develops in terms of feel. If the skin mass starts to feel hard or less movable under your dog’s skin, you should bring your pet to the vet for a diagnosis.

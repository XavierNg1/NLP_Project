 GTA 4 has online play capabilities, but you can only play online and save your progress when you connect to your online account, which depends on the system you are using. Regardless, the account log-in should start when you launch the game. So launch the game by double-clicking its shortcut on your desktop.


Logging in lets you save and then use your progress to play online.;
, When the game starts up, and after the publisher logos appear, the online account window will prompt you to log in. Type your log-in details when the log-in window appears. When you’re done, press the “Log in” button.


Your account should then be logged in, allowing your to play Multiplayer mode and save your progress in Single Player.
 Once you’ve logged in, you can either start a new game or continue your previous session’s progress. Begin by clicking on “Play” in the Start menu.
 If you want to begin a new game, click on “New Game.”


If you already have a game in progress that you want to continue playing on, ignore this step and go to the next one.
 If you’ve already played endless hours and want to keep playing from where you left off, just click on “Resume Game.”

, When logged into your online account, your progress is saved automatically upon completing missions.
 If you want to save your progress manually, you can still do so. Save manually by going to one of your safehouses. They are the house icons in the map.


When you’re at the safehouse, simply head to your bed and stand close to it.
A save button should pop out. Press the indicated button to save your progress manually.

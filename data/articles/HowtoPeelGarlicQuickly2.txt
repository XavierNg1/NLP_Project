 Do this on a flat, stable surface. Make sure to face the sharp edge of the blade away from you.
 Place your outstretched palm over the blade, then push downward with a quick, light blow. The goal here isnâ€™t to completely pulverize the garlic clove, but rather to break apart the peel from the rest of the garlic. You can learn to do this very quickly with practice, but don't get careless with your fingers.
 The peel should now separate easily from the rest of the garlic.

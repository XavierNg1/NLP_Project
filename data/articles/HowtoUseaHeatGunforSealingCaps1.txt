 These seals cover the neck of the bottle, which has a lip at the opening to give the seal a firm attachment point. Such seals do not extend over the cork. These seals leave the central part of the cork exposed so that the wine can breathe.
 As home wine making is a popular hobby, there are many companies that provide these seals. Look for bottling and home wine making materials providers on the Internet. The seals usually will come with a tear-away band to remove seals already in place., Slide the seal over the neck of the corked wine bottle with the tear-away band on the end of the seal closest to the bottle opening. Slide the seal down far enough that it wraps around the flared edge of the bottle opening, but will not close over the cork., Use the heat gun on a low setting. Move the stream of air over the seal without lingering in any single area. Rotating the bottle as heat is applied will help insure this. Do not let the tip of the heat gun make contact with the seal. Continue until the seal appears snug. Avoid over-shrinking the seal, which could cause the seal to crack.

 You see, characters such as Goofy and Donald were created to make Mickey Mouse interesting. By himself, Mickey was okay, but Walt Disney wasn't going to leave him alone. Instead, he created a crazy cast of co-characters to play off of him. Then Micky was interesting; this is why we have co-characters. Now the pressure is off to make the most perfect main character.;
, Not in a geeky group of unlikely hero's sort of way, but every day interactions. Is it the barber? The handyman? Mom? Siblings? All of these ordinary types of people can add or take away from your main character in lots of fun or morbid ways. So go ahead and make a big list of who your main character could run across during the story.
 Writing sage's across the world will all say "write what you know" So, lets do just that. With your list handy put a name of someone you know next to a type. Be fair and list the best person for the job. Would your own Mom be a good fit for your main characters Mom? If not then put someone else, but make the fit as perfect as you can.
 Now your characters are not the people you know, but based on them.
 This way, you can find an interesting dynamic that wouldn't have been there before. You don't need these characters to be your main characters best friend, but to be there to make him or her look and feel more interesting to the reader.

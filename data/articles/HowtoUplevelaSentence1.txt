 Strong verbs are usually connected to a direct action the subject is doing in the sentence. They carry a specific meaning. Avoid weak verbs, such as "to be" or "have." Strong verbs will grab the reader’s attention and add more intent to the sentence.For example, rather than write, “The man was going up the hill,” you may write, “The man strode up the hill” or “The man ran up the hill.”
You may also use strong verbs in an academic paper to describe a source. For example, rather than write, “Shakespeare has an argument that man is trapped by his own ambition,” you may write, “Shakespeare argued that man is trapped by his own ambition.”;
, This will put the reader right in the heart of the action from the very start. Use a verb with -ing at the end, followed by a comma. The verb should describe the action of the subject in the sentence.For example, you may write, “Jogging, Mark nearly stumbled over a rock.” Or you may write, “Screaming, Sarah crawled away from the bear.”

, Adverbs are a great option for adding more description and detail to a sentence. Adverbs end in -ly and describe the verb in the sentence. It should appear after the verb.For example, you may write, “Fred sang soulfully to the crowd,” or “Della wept quietly in the corner.”

, Sometimes you can uplevel a sentence by transforming it into a question. Having questions in a paragraph can help to vary the sentence type and add complexity to your writing. Use “who,” “what,” “where,” “how,” and “why” to start the question.For example, you may change a sentence like “I wonder how you dig a hole in winter” to “How do you dig a hole in winter?” or “I question why we say a prayer before dinner” to “Why do we say a prayer before dinner?”

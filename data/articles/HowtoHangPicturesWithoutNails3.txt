 There are several brands that make hooks that are designed to be inserted into drywall without hammers, nails, or any other tools. These include Hercules Hooks, Super Hooks, Monkey Hooks, and Gorilla Hooks.They are made of different materials and rated to hold varying weights, but each one does require making a small hole in the wall. According to the manufacturers:


A Hercules Hook can hold as much as 150 pounds (68 kg).
A Super Hook can hold up to 80 pounds (36.28 kg).
A Monkey Hook can hold up to 35 pounds (15.87 kg).
A Gorilla Hook can hold as much as 50 pounds (22.67 kg).
 Push the long, curved (not kinked), tapered end of the hook through your drywall. Once youâ€™ve pushed it most of the way in, position it so the small hook on the outside will be facing upright (so that you can hang things from it). Set it in place by pushing it in the rest of the way., Most press-in hooks come in packs of four or more. To hang heavier pictures using two hooks, measure the width of the picture and divide it into thirds. Place one hook at the one-third mark, and a second hook at the two-thirds mark. For even heavier pictures that require three hooks, measure the picture and divide it into quarters. Place one hook at the one-quarter mark, one hook in the center (two-quarters), and one hook at the three-quarter mark.

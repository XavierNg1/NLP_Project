 Talking about mental illness is not an easy topic anywhere you do it. Given the personal nature of the topic, try to do it someplace private, like your home or at one of your family member's homes. This will give you all the privacy you need to deal with the tough discussion.


This will prevent you from getting interrupted while discussing it.
 Even though you are the one with bipolar disorder, it affects those around you as well. Listen to your family express any worries or concerns they have about your condition and how it affects them.


This may be hard to do since you are the one with bipolar depression disorder. However, make sure you keep your mind open and really hear their concerns., Explain to your family that the treatment for bipolar depression is long term. Even when you feel better, you will need to continue treatment. You should also explain each part of your treatment to your family so they truly understand what you are doing to help.This will likely be some combination of therapy, lifestyle changes, and medication.
For example, tell you family, "I am working with a therapist to work through my issues, I am on medication to help level out my moods, and I am working on changing my though patterns and life choices to bring me a better, more stable life."

, A good way to help your family understand is to give them places they can look for support. Tell them about support groups they can join, online education resources they can read, or offer to go to a family therapy session with them.


Organizations such as Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, National Institute of Mental Health, and the Mayo Clinic have a plethora of online resources your family can use to better understand your condition.
There are online support groups locators for the United State and other countries that your family can use to find a bipolar support group near you.

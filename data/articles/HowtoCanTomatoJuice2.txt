 You may also use a deep, heavy stockpot if you do not have a canner. Fill the canner halfway with water and gradually begin heating it over medium heat.
 Do not wait for the juice to cool. Moreover, you must only use standard, food-grade glass canning jars, complete with new metal lids and clean metal screw bands. Place a funnel in each jar and ladle the hot juice through the funnel. Fill each jar, leaving only 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) of empty space in between the juice and the top of the jar.
, Twist the metal lid onto the mouth of the jar. Secure the lid in place by tightly screwing the sealing ring over the lid and the jar.
 Use canning tongs, also called a jar lifter, to lower the jars into the water. Place the jars into the hot water carefully, preventing them from touching. The glass jars could chip or break of allowed to clink together.
 The jars should be covered by about 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5 cm) of water.
 Cover the pot and increase the heat to high. Once the water begins to boil, begin keeping track of the processing time.For pint (500 ml) jars, allow the juice to sit in boiling water for 35 minutes.
For quart (1000 ml) jars, allow the juice to sit in boiling water for 40 minutes.
Add an additional 5 minutes onto the processing time if you live at an altitude between 1000 and 3000 ft (305 to 914 m), and extra 10 minutes for altitudes between 3000 and 6000 ft (914 m to 1.8 km), and an extra 15 minutes for altitudes above 6000 ft (1.8 km).
 Use canning tongs to avoid splashing yourself with hot water. Do not tighten the rings and do not allow the jars to strike one another.
 Keep them on folded towels at room temperature. Do not place them in a drafty area.
 Gently press the center of the lid. If the dome does not pop up, the jar is sealed. If it does pop up, you will need to reheat and re-jar the juice.
 Remove the rings before storing them to prevent the rings from rusting.

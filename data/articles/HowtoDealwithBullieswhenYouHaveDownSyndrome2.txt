 Say "please stop," "leave me alone," or "you're bothering me." Say it lots of times if you need to. Keep repeating, and get louder if you need to, so that other people hear you. If they notice what is going on, they might help you.

You don't need to say anything fancy. Just keep repeating. This is called being a "broken record," and it is a good way to deal with bullies.
Sometimes people aren't paying attention, or they are very scared of the bully. This means they might not help you right away.
 You might wonder if you should treat the bully the same way they are treating you. This is usually a bad idea. The bully wants you to fight back because they think it's fun, even though it's not fun for you. And the grown-ups might think you are a bully too.

Don't call names or be rude.
Don't push the bully.
Don't say something nasty about the bully, like telling them that they are mean (even if it's true).
Don't fight.
Keep repeating your magic words: "please stop," "leave me alone," and "you're bothering me."

, Start going towards someone who is in charge. The bully might stop if they see that a grown-up is nearby, because they don't want the grown-up to know that they are being a bully., Write down the day and time, and the facts of what happened. Keep the journal somewhere private, where bullies won't find it. If you can type it, that's better, because it's harder to get lost or stolen. You can show the journal to an adult when you need help.

 Most hotels offer complimentary pick up and drop, enquire regarding the same. If your hotel does not offer one, you may ask your hotel to book one for you, however this is a bit more expensive.
 The airport authorities provide transport to fixed points within the city; you can call and inquire about the same to determine the closest point to be dropped off with respect to your hotel. You can then use an auto-rickshaw and get to your hotel. However, this is not advisable when and if your flight lands late at night or you have too much luggage.
 The deal with such taxis is that you have to pay the fare in advance, once you provide an address.

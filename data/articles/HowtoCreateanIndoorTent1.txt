 This tent is definitely one you'll need to take down at the end of the day or in a day or two. Drag pieces of furniture together. Throw fabric over the top, such as a large sheet, and weigh down the sheet on the outside with pillows.


If you place chairs facing outward, throw the sheet over the tops, and let it hang down to the seats on the outside. Then, place pillows or books on top of the sheet where it rests on the seat of the chairs.
For a bigger tent, use binder clips to attach one sheet to another.;
, For a simple tent, tighten a string between two sturdy points. Throw a sheet over it in an a-frame shape to create a simple, quick setup tent. Add some pillows below, and you're good to go.For another option, run a dowel under the fabric, then use strings on the end to attach it to the ceiling.
 Find a tablecloth that runs all the way to the floor. Throw it over the table to create the tent. To get into the tent, just duck under an edge. If you want a more permanent door, pin or clip an edge up.Create your own tent-tablecloth by cutting a piece of fabric slightly bigger than your tabletop. Sew or glue a skirt on that goes all the way around the table, leaving a slit on one side. Hem the fabric to make it last longer, or use a fabric that doesn't fray, such as fleece.

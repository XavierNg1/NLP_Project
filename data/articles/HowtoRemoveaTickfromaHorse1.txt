 Use fine point or needle nose tweezers to remove the tick. Do not use blunt tweezers. By using blunt tweezers, you will risk squeezing the tick’s stomach, which could cause it to regurgitate its stomach fluids into the horse.;
, With your tweezers, grab the tick as close to the horse's skin as possible.Apply enough pressure to grab the area where the head attaches to the neck. However, be careful not to apply too much pressure. Too much pressure can cause the tick's body to break off with its head still embedded in your horse’s skin., In a slow, vertical motion, gently pull the tick until it detaches. Do not squeeze, yank, or twist the tweezers while you are pulling the tick. This can cause the body to detach from the head, leaving the head embedded in your horse’s skin.The tick is completely removed if all of its head parts are gone from the horse’s skin. You may also see bite marks in your horse’s skin, and possibly parts of the mouth, but as long as the head is removed, you can assume that the tick has been removed safely.
Pull the tick directly upward from the skin to get the smoothest removal possible.

 Many churches have Pew Bibles for parishioners to read along during worship services, as well as during church-led Bible study sessions. Most Bibles will have the specific translation, or version, printed on the binding of the Bible. If you cannot find it, the first page of the Bible will likely name the translation.

If you are not a churchgoer, or you do not like the translation your church uses, research the different translations. Read at least a chapter from versions that interest you. If you can understand and appreciate the way the Bible is written in the particular translation, jot down what translation it is.;
, Bible Gateway is one of the more common websites offering numerous Bible translations. Find one that suits you best, and bookmark it.

If you own a smartphone or a tablet computer, there are several free applications available for Bible reading. Research options and translations available to you in applications, and download one you find to be the best.
 In print, it can feel necessary to read from Genesis to Revelation in order. Online, however, it is easier to select other books to start with. Choose what order you wish to read the Bible in, and write a plan of how much you will read per day., Set daily notifications, mark it down in your calendar, or create an alarm to alert you of when you should read. Don't become frustrated or give up if you get off-track. You can always catch up or adjust your plan to accommodate as needed.

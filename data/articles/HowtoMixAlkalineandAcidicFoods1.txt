 All vegetables are considered alkaline foods. Broccoli, cucumber, and string beans are a few alkaline "power foods." Fruit that is fresh, with the exception of cranberries and plums, are also alkaline foods. Some dried fruits, dates and figs, count as well. Milk and almonds are generally alkaline foods when eaten on their own.


If you forget the precise list, just go for leafy vegetables and bright fruits, such as watermelon.
Alkaline foods are not processed, so if you find yourself buying canned or prepackaged, do a double-check. Even prepackaged lettuce (in salad mixes) can diminish the health benefits.;
, Meat, fish, poultry and eggs are generally acidic foods. Cereal, grains, and nuts are usually acid producing as well. Cheese is another common culprit with parmesan being ranked as the most acidic.Meat, fish, dairy products, caffeine, sugar and salt are the most acid forming foods.Be aware that even seemingly healthy items, such as wild cooked trout or salmon, can raise your body’s acid levels.
Choosing low-fat versions of some foods, such as milk, can lower acid levels. This is a good compromise measure for those people who don’t want to drastically change their diet.
 A wide variety of waters are considered neutral — tap water, spring water, river water, and even sea water. They all exist at the center of the pH scale, ranking at 7.0. Olive oil and egg whites are also commonly considered to be neutral in nature.

 If you decorate it too soon, the icing will melt and slide right off. Also, a warm cake is a fragile cake. If you try to handle it too soon, it may fall apart. Listed below are several decorating ideas., For a richer cake, spread more buttercream down the sides. Use a spatula, palette knife, or butter knife to do this. Start spreading from the center outwards. You can make the frosting as smooth or as textured as you'd like., Slice the cake in half horizontally. Spread some buttercream or over the bottom layer. Start from the center and work your way towards the ends. When you are done, place the upper layer on top. You can then spread more buttercream over the top and sides or the cake, or drizzle some glac√© icing over it., For some added color and flavor, sprinkle some lemon zest, orange zest, candied orange peel, or candied ginger over the top of your frosted cake., Cover your cake with thick, buttercream frosting first. Then, arrange the sugared cranberries however you want on top. To make the berries look like holly, add some mint leaves. Here is one decorating idea:

After you have frosted your cake, three berries in the center. Arrange rest all around the edges of the cake. Place two to three mint leaves around the three center berries.
 Begin by frosting your cake with a thick layer of buttercream. Make or buy some 1 to 2 inch (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) tall gingerbread men. Stick them on top of a cake, right into the frosting.

You can use plain gingerbread men, or decorate them with piped icing ahead of time.

 As mentioned above, whole wheat flour is heavier than white flour, which can leave your baked goods dense and stodgy. To avoid this, try sifting your whole wheat flour two or three times before using it.
 Whole wheat batters and doughs tend to be thicker than those made with white flour. As a result, it's a good idea to allow for a slightly longer cooking time to ensure the baked goods are fully cooked through.


The one problem with this is that a longer cooking time may cause the outside of the baked goods to burn, while the inside remains undercooked.
To combat this, you should also reduce the temperature of the oven (or pan, if you're making wholewheat pancakes) and increase the cooking time even further.

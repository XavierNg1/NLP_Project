 There are a variety of ways to do this. Try keeping a log or journal for several days. Or make a chart or graph illustrating how your time is spent. Be sure to keep track of everything that's taking up your time: sleep, work, eating, chores, school, etc.


Be honest with yourself here. This will show you how best to manage your time, especially if you find yourself upset at spending so much time in one area of your life.;
, Now that you know where your time is going, how would you like it to be spent? Mainly, what do you want to change about your current routine? If you noticed any wasted time, start by making a goal to address it.For example, if you found yourself spending several hours responding to pointless emails, taking extra breaks, or waiting for things, make it a goal to rescue that wasted time.
 This doesn't have to be incredibly detailed. Just rank your goals in the order in which you'd like to complete them. Try to put at least 30 percent of your weekly time towards accomplishing a goal.Re-evaluate your goals periodically. You may find after accomplishing some tasks that your priorities have shifted. Don't be afraid to alter your goals or plans.
 Give yourself a manageable range of time and make a list of the goals you must accomplish. Keep a separate list of things you'd like to get done. Then, look at your week and assign tasks for each day that get you closer to achieving your goals.


Remember to include time for family, relaxation, or personal time. While you don't need to detail what you'll be doing, you should be sure to block out the time.
 Don't allow your schedule to fill up with things that don't get you closer to your goals or that don't make you happy. If something seems like a waste of your time, try to cut it short or get out of it.


Likewise, don't feel like you have to accomplish everything yourself or it won't be done correctly. You'll most likely need to learn how to trust and let go in order to accomplish your tasks.

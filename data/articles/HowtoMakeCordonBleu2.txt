 Restaurants will usually pre-fry the chicken, ensuring the breadcrumbs don't get soggy in the oven. After coating in breadcrumbs, heat up 1 tablespoon olive oil on medium-high heat. Cook all sides of the chicken until the outsides are brown, then transfer to the buttered dish to finish in the oven.


Lower the oven temperature to 350 if you pre-fry.
You will only need to cook the chicken in the oven for 20-25 minutes if you pre-fry it., The bacon's natural fat will help the chicken cook evenly in the oven, and you'll save the egg & crumb mess. Close chicken breasts and wrap with sliced bacon, securing the bacon with wooden toothpicks. You can then cook it like normal.
 The biggest issue here is hardness, as Swiss cheese holds its shape well under heat. Similar "melting" cheeses will work as well, like cheddar, Gruyere, cream cheese, and mozzarella., Looking to really make the dish your own? Skip the ham for a more flavorful or unique smoked meat. The options are endless, but in general, you want a meat that is naturally salty, thinly cut, and has a somewhat smokey flavor. Some ideas include:


Prosciutto
Iberian ham
Cooked bacon
Pancetta
Capicola

, Most restaurant-quality cordon bleu is topped with a simple but creamy sauce to help cut the salty, crunchy texture. Frequently the dish is paired with Dijon Mustard, which provides a necessary burst of acid to completely the dish. To make a sauce, start with a basic roux, then add milk, dijon mustard, and salt and pepper to taste:


Melt 2 tablespoons butter on medium heat. Whisk in 2 tablespoons flour and cook until golden brown, whisking the entire time (1-2 minutes)
Add 1-1/2 cups of whole milk, 2 tablespoons dijon, and a touch of salt and pepper slowly, stirring throughout.
Lower the heat and stir until desired thickness. If you want, mix in fresh rosemary and/or thyme before serving.

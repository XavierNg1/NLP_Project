 Connect an Ethernet cable from the Ethernet computer on one port to the Ethernet computer on the other.


If you don't have an Ethernet port, you can also use a USB-to-Ethernet adapter.
 On each computer, in the Network preferences panel, select Show Network Port Configurations and make sure Built-in Ethernet is checked.


If Ethernet is active, it will be shown in the Network Status pane of the Network System Preferences panel.
 Open the Sharing preferences panel on one of the machines, and activate Personal File Sharing. Make note of the computer address, shown here as "afp://192.168.0.2" (afp stands for Apple File Protocol).



Using a Finder window in OS X 10.3 or later, click the Network icon in the side bar.
When all have loaded, look for the name of the first computer you set up, and click on it.
You may be asked for your password.
Another dialog will appear with all the available volumes. Select one or all of them, and their icons will appear in your sidebar as partitions.

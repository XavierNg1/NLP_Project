 A hazmat suit is an absolute must if you are traveling to the Glowing Sea. Hazmat suits provide you with 1000 radiation resistance. There are several ways to get a hazmat suit. The easiest way is to go to Becky Fallon in Fallon's Basement located in Diamond City. However, if you are short on caps, other ways would be to go to the Yangtze, Marowski's Chem Lab, or Cambridge Polymer Labs.
 Power Armor is mandatory if you want even the slightest chance of surviving in the Glowing Sea. It will protect you from Deathclaws, Radscorpions, Feral Ghouls, and other dangerous enemies. It also provides radiation resistance.

You can wear power armor over your hazmat suit for ultimate radiation protection

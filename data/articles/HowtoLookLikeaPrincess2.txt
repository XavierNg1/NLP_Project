 Disney princesses are big right now, but it can be difficult to dress like one in regular daily life. Fortunately you can incorporate modern-day Disney princess styles into your look.


You want to get the color scheme correct when you're picking what looks to use. For example: if you wanted to emulate Belle in her yellow ballgown, you might get a '50s inspired yellow dress, with golden earrings, and matching yellow headband, and shoes to match.
You can create the princess look with a more modern outfit. For example: you might pick a pair of green jeans to match with a purple top, with fish scale like shoes and shell earrings for Ariel.
You can get really creative with this and try out different outfits that are inspired by Disney princesses.
 You can easily buy a Disney princess costume, or you can make one. This latter is obviously more difficult, but can be very rewarding. Again, it depends on which princess you want to look like. These are good for Halloween and costume parties.


Making a gown like Belle's yellow ballgown requires that you have a sewing machine and the right colored material, but the end result can be very cool.
Pocahontas's outfit or Ariel's mermaid outfit are easier costumes to make, because there is less material.
 Most of the Disney princesses have subtle, natural style make-up, with eye shadow and lipstick depending on their outfits and so on.


Golden champagne and peach colored eye shadows are good choices to use for your natural look.
You'll want to line your eyelids with a darker eyeliner (black or dark brown) and smudge depending on which princess you're emulating.
 While your hair is never going to look exactly like your favorite Disney princess you can get a hairstyle that is close to it. You can use this for your Disney princess costume or you can couple it with your modern-day Disney princess look.

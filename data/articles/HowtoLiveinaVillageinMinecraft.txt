 The following method can increase your chances of finding one:


Write down the seed you are using by using the /seed command.
Create a new world on superflat with the same seed . Preferably on creative.
Find a village and write down the coordinates.
Go to those coordinates on your other world.;
, You will want a clear shot of it so you can shoot any zombies attacking. Make it however you want, but you might want to use an iron door so villagers don't invade your home.


You can also occupy an already existing house in the village.
 Zombies won't be able to enter, but don't forget about the other mobs that can harm you. Make it cobblestone or better, at least three blocks high with at least one block overhang.
 This will prevent some monster spawning.
, Traps like cannons and deep pits into cactus or lava are a great way to get mob drops. Don't forget to keep it villager friendly as they can fall in the trap.
 Trade with the villagers and protect them.

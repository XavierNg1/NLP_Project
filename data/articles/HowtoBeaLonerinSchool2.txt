 Loners keep to themselves and don’t want people to try to interact with them. To help with this, discourage people from approaching or talking to you by keeping your eyes down. Don’t look people in the eye and encourage them to speak to you.Make sure not to make eye contact with people in areas where they might come and talk to you, like in the lunchroom or the classroom.
 Try folding your arms over your chest. This signals that you don’t want to be bothered and want to be left alone. This body position helps make you look closed off and unapproachable.Fold your arms loosely across your body and keep your head down. This will help people realize you don’t want to be bothered.
 Adding accessories helps put up a barrier between you and others. They will see you doing something with the accessory and not disturb you. The accessories also give you a reason to ignore everyone around you.


For example, you can wear headphones, read a book, look on your smartphone, or draw on a sketchpad.

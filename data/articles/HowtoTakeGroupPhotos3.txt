 If you are the photographer and not the subject of the photo, it is easier for you to prep for the perfect photo. Choose a nice background that is worthy of the occasion. Make sure there are no unsightly objects in the frame that will distract from the photo.
 As the photographer, it is your job to ensure that everyone is visible and looking their best in the photo. Make sure that you can see all of the faces (especially if there are a lot of people of varying heights) and that no one will be embarrassed by anything in the camera’s frame – like spinach in their teeth or their fly being down., Try to be cute and funny to get people to feel more comfortable with you. This will help them produce more natural-looking smiles. Make sure you let everyone know when you are taking the photo so that they can smile on cue.
 Inevitably, someone will not look their best in each photo that you take, especially when you are dealing with large group shots. The more photos you take, the more likely it is that there will be one that is acceptable to everyone. Take several so that they have some to choose between.

, Transfer commercial ice cream to your refrigerator to get softer for about half an hour, then transfer it to the baking pan and spread it with a spatula or knife. Place plastic wrap atop the pan and allow it to freeze for no less than 6 hours (you could even freeze it overnight).
 Take the frozen ice cream outside of your freezer and remove it from the pan using the hanging parchment paper or aluminum foil. Speedily use a steak knife or biscuit cutter to create 9 ice cream squares (they need to be equal).
 Put the baking sheet in your freezer and allow to set in there for no less than an hour.
 Put a bowl that's medium sized above a little saucepan. Warm the saucepan with the heat being low and put the chocolate inside the medium bowl. Stir the chocolate once in a while, and continue to stir until the chocolate has melted thoroughly.
 Turn the heat switch to off and transfer to a wire rack to cool to a medium temperature.
 Dunk the squares into the chocolate mixture very speedily, until the chocolate topping coats the entire ice cream square, then take the dunked squares out of the chocolate. Continue to do this process until all the ice cream bars have been dunked, then allow to freeze again for no less than half an hour.

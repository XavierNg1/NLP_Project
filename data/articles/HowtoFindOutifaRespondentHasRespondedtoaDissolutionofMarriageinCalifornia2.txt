 Each superior county court in California has a unique website,where the public can look up case information in the case management system (CMS). To look up the case online, follow these instructions:

Go to http://www.courts.ca.gov/find-my-court.htm.
Under Superior Court, click the county in which the case is filed.
Unfortunately, each county’s superior court website has a different way of accessing case information. However, you should be able to search for a case using the case number. If you don’t know the case number, see Part One.
If a response has been filed in the case, you should see it in the list of forms filed. Keep in mind that a form could be physically file-stamped, but not yet entered in the CMS. Usually filed forms are entered in the CMS within a few business days of being file-stamped.

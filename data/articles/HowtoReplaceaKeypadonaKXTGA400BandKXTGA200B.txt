 See Things You'll Need, below.;
, First you will need to take the battery cover off, and remove any battery inside. Once that is done you'll need to unscrew the two screws at the bottom corners. After you've done that use the flat head screwdriver to pry open the phone (it should snap open easily, do not be afraid to apply force if needed.) Once you have the back cover/shell off, you will need to undo the screw at the top left by the antenna, remove that screw and then pull the antenna upwards until it is no longer over the main circuit board. After that flip the circuit board (mother board) over and move it partially to the side (do not try to yank it away from the front cover/shell, the antenna is still attached.) Once it is flipped over you should be able to see the old keypad either stuck on the motherboard or sitting inside the key holes in the front cover/shell of the phone, either way remove it and throw it away!

, Take your cloth and dip it in a little bit of rubber alcohol and start cleaning the area of the motherboard that the keypad lays against (right under the LCD screen.) This could take several minutes if there is goo on it, but take the time to clean it up!

, Start by making sure the silver buttons are still inside the front shell/cover of the phone before you put the new keypad inside the key holes, once you know the two silver buttons are there, put the new keypad in where the old one was and start putting the phone back together (reverse the above steps.)

 Whether you get them on sale or you go for the expensive dogs; make sure you find the kind of hotdogs you like best.
 Add bacon, cheese or any other topping right on the dog before you cook it. Use toothpicks to hold a piece of wrapped bacon in place or throw on a piece of cheese right before the hotdog is fully cooked.
 If you are using a garden rake, add one hotdog to each prong. Make sure the hotdog is fully pierced and you can see the other end of the rake (so that the hotdog doesnâ€™t fall off the rake and into your fire).
 Make sure you have a decent flame or heat coming from your heat source. You should be able to cook the hotdogs fairly quickly if you have a strong flame/heat.
 Avoid placing the meat directly into the flame if you are cooking them over a campfire because it could cause the hot dogs to burn.
 Turn the rake or your cooking device over to ensure the meat browns evenly.
 Or use a hot pad, a towel or your t-shirt to remove the dogs and plate them.

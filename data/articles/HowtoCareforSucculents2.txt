 Mealy bugs, aphids, and vine weevils are the most common pests that succulents attract. Check for mealy bugs at the point where the leaf attaches to the stem. Look for aphids on leaves, stems, and flower buds. Watch for impaired growth or limpness, which is evidence of vine weevils or root mealy bugs.Mealy bugs are usually about 2 millimetres (0.079 in) to 3 millimetres (0.12 in) long and resemble lice. When they first attack, they'll leave balls of white fluff on the plant. When squashed, they leave a red stain.Vine weevils are large gray insects that resemble beetles. They lay their eggs in the soil in late summer, and their larvae have fat white bodies with brown heads.Aphids are about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) long. Their bodies are pear-shaped and can be black, green, yellow, pink, gray, or brown., Mix a few drops of soap in tepid water. If you have severe infestation, add a few drops of cooking oil to the mixture. Apply it to the affected areas with a cotton swab. You can buy insecticidal soap at your local nursery.For root mealy bugs, remove and discard of the soil. Dip the plant in water with a temperature of about 160 °F (71 °C). Replant the succulent in fresh, clean soil., Buy nematodes at your local nursery. Water them into the soil, where they'll attack the weevil larvae. Repeat the treatment according to the instructions on the package., Pests can “hitchhike” on plants fresh from the nursery. If you're already growing succulents, isolate the new arrivals for about two weeks. Check for pests and signs of disease daily.


After you plant your succulent in its permanent location, continue to monitor for problems at least once a week.

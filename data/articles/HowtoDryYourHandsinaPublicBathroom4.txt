 Try to give yourself room, so you can hold onto the cloth. Using both hands, pull down evenly on either side until you see fresh cloth., Hold the cloth with one hand and dry your other hand. Then, switch hands and repeat these movements. Don’t touch anything else while you do this. You don’t want to risk making your hands dirty.
 Placing your hands on opposite sides, rub the cloth briskly across your hands. There are different ways to do this. You can move them in the same direction, or you can move one hand up and the other hand down.
 If the cloth becomes too saturated to get your hands completely dry, simply pull on the cloth to expose fresh toweling. Be careful to not touch the dryer’s exterior as you do this.


Try not to rub your hands on the wet cloth, because this will only make your hands more damp.

 During a seizure, your dog may twitch or shake uncontrollably. Seizures can be a one-time event. If so, they're usually caused by a specific illness or injury. But, if seizures happen repeatedly, they're referred to as epilepsy.Since it's important to determine if your dog has repeated seizures in order to make an epilepsy diagnosis, track if and when your dog has repeated seizures and how long they last.
 Many things can cause seizures or epilepsy in a German Shepherd. The veterinarian will need to test for other conditions or to see whether your dog is in good health. Some common causes of epilepsy in the German Shepherd include:Eating toxic substances
Diabetes
Low blood sugar
Liver disease
Kidney disease
Brain infections (like encephalitis), injuries, or cancer
Strokes
Problems with the blood such as electrolyte imbalance or anemia

, The vet will take a complete medical history of your dog and examine him for head injury. The vet will also want to know what your dog has recently eaten. Although there aren't diagnostic tests for epilepsy, the vet will do blood work, urine testing, and possibly an electrocardiogram (ECG).These are done to rule out other conditions. If other conditions are found, your dog is diagnosed with secondary epilepsy.
 If the vet can find no cause for the repeated seizures, your German Shepherd will be diagnosed with primary or idiopathic epilepsy. This true form of epilepsy means that your dog's brain is experiencing uncontrolled bursts of energy that aren't caused by any illness or injury.Primary epilepsy usually shows up in dogs between the ages of 6 months to 6 years of age. German Shepherds can inherit the condition.

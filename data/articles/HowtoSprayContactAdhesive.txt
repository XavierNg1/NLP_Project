 Wipe up the excess dust with a shop vacuum and tack cloths. Both surfaces must be completely dust free.


It is a good idea to vacuum in the workspace to avoid adhesion problems and blowing dust.;
, Use a solvent to remove oil and dirt if the item can’t be washed with mild detergent and water. Dry the surfaces completely.
 Read the package to determine more specific temperature requirements for the adhesive you are using.
 Hand held spray applicators are ideal for small jobs. High volume, low-pressure applicators are ideal for medium to large jobs jobs.


Automatic spray applicators are ideal for the largest jobs. They will require larger air compressors.
Pressurized cylinders and compressors require care during storage and use.
 Adhesives can contain strong chemicals.
 Turn on the adhesive and apply it one coat at a time, until you are comfortable and ready to work on your main project., Both surfaces need to be facing up to apply the adhesive.
 Spray a uniform layer and then let it dry for 30 minutes. These surfaces require two coats of adhesive to adhere completely.
 Allow it to dry for 10 to 30 minutes, or the amount indicated on package directions. It must dry slightly to evaporate some of the liquid before it is ready to adhere.


Some adhesives require you to wait four to 24 hours before bonding. Bonding is the act of connecting the two adhesive surfaces together and smoothing the air bubbles out., Use several parallel spacers. Place your other surface on top of these spacers and position it exactly.
 Set the top surface carefully on the bottom surface.
 Start in the center and work out toward the edges.
 Try a pinch or nip roll for best results., If you’ve done a thorough job of applying pressure, you can trim the edges almost immediately with power tools or machinery.

 Almost as if you are a blank white canvas and your style is the art. What would you want to say to people? Indie is about finding your own voice and and being proud to speak.


Look for vintage clothes that you like. Older cuts and prints are often lost to time, and some of them are completely worth bringing back!
Don't be afraid to wear something that you might think is a little crazy. Being indie is about being you! If you think it will look good, give it a shot.
 Visit your local thrift store instead â€” you will save money, help the earth by recycling, and find treasures you would never see at the mall.
 Jewelry, watches, hats, scarves: all of them are avenues of expression. Look for treasures in your travels, but don't forget that you can make them yourself! Your accessories should look like they have significance to you.
 Indie culture tends to focus on a natural look. Minimize the makeup, wear organically shaped clothing (flowy tops or willowy pants), and keep your hair looking great but kind of like you just rolled out of bed or came off the beach.

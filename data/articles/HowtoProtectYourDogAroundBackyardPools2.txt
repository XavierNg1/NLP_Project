 If your dog doesnâ€™t know how to swim, or you have an older or obese dog that might get tired, you should put them in dog life vests when they are playing around the pool. This helps your dog stay safe in the event that they fall into the water.You can buy dog life vests at any pet store.
 You should skip the dog toys in and around the pool. If your dog is running after toys around the pool, they can hurt their paws or fall into the pool. If your dog is in the pool, they may chip a tooth by grabbing the toy and biting the cement edge instead.Dog toys increase the likelihood that your dog will swallow pool water full of unhealthy chemicals.
 Chlorine and chemicals are not healthy for your dog. They can cause the coat and skin to dry out. If the dog remains damp for too long, they can get hot spots in vulnerable areas, like around their ears or under the collar.Rinse your dog with a garden hose or in the bathtub after they have been in the pool. Use a clean towel to dry them off afterwards.

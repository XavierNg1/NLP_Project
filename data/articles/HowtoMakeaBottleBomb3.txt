 Take a single Mentos and poke a hole through the center. You can use a nail, safety pin, pencil, ballpoint pen, or similar to create the hole.


If you need help getting the object through the center of the Mentos, you can gently tap it with a hammer to push it through. Be careful not to hurt yourself.
You can also try tying the string or floss around the Mentos rather than through it, but be sure it’s tied very tightly., Run about four inches of string (sewing thread or floss works best) through the hole in the Mentos. Hold the string by the two ends so that the Mentos is suspended in the center.
 Put the Mentos just inside to the mouth of the bottle—don’t let it touch the soda—and drape the ends of the string over the lip of the bottle.
 Keeping the ends of the string outside the bottle, screw the cap back on so that the string is held in place by the tightened cap. Cut off the portions of string left dangling outside the cap.
 When they unscrew the cap, the Mentos will drop into the soda and cause the soda to explode out of the bottle. (Be prepared for a mess.)

 Putting your goals into words in your diary allows you to focus more easily on those goals, and often makes them feel more achievable.Not all goals have to be lofty ones. You can use your diary for goals both big and small, short-term and long-term.
The main objective is describing clearly what those goals are. Once you do that, developing a plan of action comes much more easily.
 You can make daily lists of simple things you need to get done, or you can create to-do lists for more long-term goals. Whether you’re trying to accomplish a certain goal, solve a particular problem or simply plan out your day, they are all much easier to tackle once you’ve broken them down into smaller tasks.If you’re trying to make a tough decision, try creating a list of pros and cons in your diary to help you.
 Use your diary to map out your day, organize your thoughts and making time to do the things you need to do, like homework or chores.


Your diary is also a great place to set reminders for yourself, especially if you are using it daily., Your diary is a written account of what you’ve done along the way and functions as an excellent log of your progress.


Progress can be hard to measure objectively and sometimes it's easy to forget successes you’ve already had.
Looking back at older entries can help you put things in perspective.

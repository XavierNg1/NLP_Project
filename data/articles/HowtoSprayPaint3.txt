 Because glass, ceramics, and porcelain all have an incredibly smooth surface, it will be too slippery for the paint to adhere well. Use sandpaper to roughen the surface a bit.
 Make sure that none of the shavings from sanding it down are stuck to the glass, as it will cause difficulty with the paint sticking. Use a damp rag or cleaner if desired.
 Glass especially needs primer because it expands and contracts with fluctuations in temperature, making cracks and creases in your paint a big possibility. Add at least one coat prior to painting.


Paint your glass. Using the same basic painting techniques as described above, apply an even coating of paint over your glass or ceramics. Allow time to dry.






Add a second coat of paint if necessary. If you feel that your project is finished with a single coat of paint, then skip this step.

 Here's what you'll need to make loaded baked sweet potatoes:


4 sweet potatoes
1 cup of cooked black beans
1 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 cup diced green onion
1/2 cup spicy or mild tomato salsa
1 cup sour cream
chili powder
paprika
pinch of salt
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese

, Wash the sweet potatoes and dry them thoroughly. Use a fork to poke holes on the top of the potatoes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 Place the sweet potatoes directly on the rack in your oven, or on a baking sheet if you prefer. Bake for about 45 minutes, or until they feel soft inside when you poke them with a fork. Remove them from the oven and allow them to cool.
 Use a knife to cut deep into the sweet potatoes and open them in half. Take a fork and mash and fluff the sweet potato meat a little, leaving it inside the skin.
 Mix the sour cream, chili powder, paprika and salt in a bowl. Distribute the black beans, pepper, green onions, tomatoes, salsa, sour cream mixture, and cheese in separate bowls for serving.
 Divide the beans evening among the four potatoes, spooning them directly on top. Load the potatoes with the other toppings to taste, finishing with a dollop of the sour cream mixture and a sprinkle of cheese. Serve warm.

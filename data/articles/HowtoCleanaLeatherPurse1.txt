 Keep rubbing the area until it is damp, but not soaked through.;
, You can use a store-bought leather bag cleaner, which often comes in a kit. You can also make your own by mixing a few drops of a mild soap (such as unscented dishwashing soap or baby soap) with distilled water.
 Try to keep your stroking motions in line with the leather's grain.This will help protect the integrity of the leather.
 Don't worry about drying the bag just yet.
 Avoid speeding the process up with a hairdryer. If you are in a hurry, consider setting the bag down in front of a fan. Cool air will be less damaging to the bag than hot.
 Use a soft cloth to apply the moisturizer. Rub the moisturizer on using circular motions. The moisturizer will help keep the leather soft and supple. Do not substitute regular hand lotion, which can stain and degrade leather.
 This will help restore the texture and shine to the bag.

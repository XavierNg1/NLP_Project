 A good sniper will only take one shot before moving to a new location. If you stay put after taking a shot-especially after hitting a target-you will be easier to track and kill.;
, The SRS99D Sniper Rifle and the Covenant Beam Rifle are the choice selects. These weapons have multiple zoom function and are relatively common.
 These nests are usually in higher places with plenty of foliage, rocks, and other natural objects used to conceal you. A good sniper position can see vast distances of the map. All this allows a sniper to kill without being killed. And as said before, keep moving. A well-seasoned sniper will scope out multiple sniping posts before taking his first shot.
 When he/she jumps, shoot near the feet or where the head will be after they land. When your target strafes, look for a pattern or a break in the movement. If a target is trying to make a speedy getaway in a vehicle, you need to adjust your aiming speed according to that of the vehicle. When you see an opportunity to fire, take it.
 This slight difference will account for where your target will be in a second. When they are in a vehicle, you have to aim further ahead than normal.
 A few sticks and your free of opposition. On the plus side, if your target has discovered your position, simply move to another location with a bead on your past spot. More than likely your enemy will return for revenge.
 As said above, grenades are good for that, but a close range weapon like a shotgun or assault rifle would be better suited in case you run out. Carrying a bubble shield or regenerator is also wise.

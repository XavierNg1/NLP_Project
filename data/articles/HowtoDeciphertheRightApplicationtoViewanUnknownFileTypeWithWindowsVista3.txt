 It will take you to a Bing search page with its search term default set to "file extension (3-digit file extension)". Just one example would be "file extension doc" but doc could have been set to most any other type of file.
 They are pretty accurate as to the programs that can open the file.


If you were to do this manually on a web search page such as Bing or Google, type the extension code followed by the phrase "site:FileInfo.com". However, this requires slightly more knowledge of how search pages work with some websites. (I.e. DOC file information can be found by typing "DOC site:FileInfo.com" into the search box of the search page, which narrows results down to stuff from FileInfo.com)

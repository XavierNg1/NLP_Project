 Use a warm (but not hot) heat setting so you don't damage your hair or your face.

Always dry your bangs first. Don't mess around putting on your moisturizing lotion or make up or start drying the rest of your hair. Your bangs are shorter and thinner than the rest of your hair and will dry quickly. Once they are dry, they will be set and it will be difficult to style them., Angle the dryer so that the warm air shoots over the hair. Don't dry your hair all the way--focus instead on getting the roots dry so that you don't have cowlicks messing up your fringe., Make sure the air from the blow dryer is always following the movement of your brush. If you are working with a lot of hair, try drying it in smaller sections, moving it gradually across your brow.Keep brushing your hair back and forth across your forehead until your roots are dry.
 Your bangs should be completely dry after a few seconds.

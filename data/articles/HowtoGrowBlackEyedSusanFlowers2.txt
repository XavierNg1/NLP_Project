 Black eyed Susans are surprisingly drought-tolerant after they become established. For the first year, however, they should be watered when the top of the soil begins to dry.


Water them only once or twice each week during dry spells from the second year on. Try to avoid getting the foliage wet, as this can cause mildew to form.
 Spread a 2-inch depth of organic mulch over the soil around the plants to help retain moisture in the soil. You don’t need to give your plants fertilizer, as they grow well enough without it.
 Remove the flowers as they begin to fade to encourage the plants to produce more flowers or, if more Black Eyed Susan plants are desired, leave a few of the flowers on the stems to go to seed.


Trim all of the stems right down to the ground in late winter to make room for fresh growth in the spring.
 This dividing should be done in March. Prepare the planting site before digging them up if the divisions are to be replanted. Water the plants one to two days before digging them up. To dig your plants up and divide them:


Push a dirt shovel into the soil all the way around the plants 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) away from the stems to sever the roots. Push the dirt shovel into the soil again and lift the whole clump up with the tip of the shovel.
Carefully work the plants apart, being sure to leave a good fist-full of roots and three to five healthy stems on each division. Replant them right away or pot them up in soil-based potting soil to give away to neighbors, friends and family.

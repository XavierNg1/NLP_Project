 If you are experiencing symptoms of a cat allergy, it is best to speak to your doctor. Most likely, your doctor will recommend the use of medication to reduce and/or prevent your symptoms. By getting your allergies under control, you are better able to become a cat person. Your doctor might recommend:


Anti-histamines.
Decongestants.
Steroids.
Injections.
 If you are living with a cat at home, you can help control your allergies by designating cat-free zones. You need a place (or two) where you can relax and recuperate when your allergies are bothering you. It's also important for you to experience allergy relief in places where you work and sleep.Consider making the following spaces in your home cat-free:


Your bedroom.
Your home office.
 Cat allergies are a reactive response to cat dander. You can reduce the amount of dander in your home (and thus reduce your allergic reactions) by having the cat groomed.You can ask a friend or family member to bathe the cat weekly, using a dander-reducing shampoo.
However, most cats strongly dislike being bathed. So another option is to have the cat groomed by a professional.

 Wheelie is basically a real life technique used by professional bikers and regular bikers. It is basically lifting your bike high enough to only have your rear wheel on the ground and lets you go faster. This technique is only available for bikes in Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart 8., This will lift the character's bike up high enough to get a nice speed boost for a brief moment. Since bikes do not let you super-drift, you can use this instead and use even when there are no turns. The wheelie is also useful for off-road bikes since it allows you to take off-road shortcuts without slowing down.

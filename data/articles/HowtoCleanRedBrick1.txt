 Use the nozzle of your high-powered vacuum cleaner to remove any surface dirt and grime on your red brick. Go over the entire surface of the brick with the nozzle of the vacuum, making sure you get into all the nooks and crannies.You can try out different settings, but you’ll probably need to use the highest one to effectively remove most of the dirt.;
, Mix 1⁄2  c (120 mL) of mild laundry detergent with 1 oz (28 g) of regular table salt and add just enough water to create a paste. Use a clean, damp cloth to apply the paste to the red brick and let it sit for fifteen minutes, or until dry.Once the paste has dried, remove the remnants with a nylon brush, or another hard-bristled brush.
If there is any remaining soot or dirt, try applying a bit of vinegar with a wet rag and wiping it clean.
 Use a clean rag to apply a bit of distilled white vinegar to the red brick. Dampen the cloth with the vinegar and wipe it across the surface of your brick. Let it sit for a few minutes and then wipe it off with a clean damp cloth.Remove any remaining vinegar residue with some warm water.

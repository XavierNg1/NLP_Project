The flavoring can be made in advance and stored for use later. Place in a sealed glass jar and place in the refrigerator or keep at room temperature. When stored, the oils and water will separate. Just mix again before use. When used, the gum arabic will keep things together (you may need to blend the syrup to break up the gum).

If your flavoring is solid (gum) it may be necessary to put part of the water into a blender, add the flavoring and acid, blend, then add sugar and additional water to finish.

 Adding acid to water reduces the risk of acid splashes, as opposed to the other way around.
 You could use any coloring you desire, or leave it in its natural state. The coloring should not affect the taste.
 In other words, however much you use of the concentrate, use five times as much water.

Carbonate the beverage yourself,
Mix soda water directly with the concentrate, instead of water in the previous step.

Use a soda fountain that will combine the concentrate with carbonated water at the tap.

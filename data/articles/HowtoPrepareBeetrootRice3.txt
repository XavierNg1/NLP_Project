 Keep it aside.
 After the oil is heated up, add mustard seeds, split black gram, split Bengal gram and red chillies.
 Once it turns brownish, add the grated beetroot and the curry leaves.
 Saute the beetroot till the raw smell goes away.
 Once it is ready, mix it with already cooked rice.
 Garnish with coriander leaves, if wished.

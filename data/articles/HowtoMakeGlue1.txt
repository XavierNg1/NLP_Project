 Use your measuring cup and measure ½ cup of flour and ⅓ cup water in a medium sized bowl. This simple flour glue is great to make if you are making crafts for a party or something short-term. This glue, however, will not usually last on long-term projects because it will dry out.;
, Blend the mixture until it as thick as pancake batter. The paste should not be too thick or too drippy.









If you need more glue, simply double the recipe.
If you need less glue, start with the amount of flour you will use, then add water, a teaspoon at a time, until it reaches the right consistency.
 Pour your glue paste in a saucepan and stir constantly until the mixture bubbles. Take it off the heat when the paste starts bubbling, and wait until the mixture cools before you use it.
 You can use a brush or your fingers to apply the glue to your crafts. The glue paste can be used to stick paper together for a variety of craft projects and decorations such as making greeting cards and kids projects.









This glue can become moldy over time. To prevent mold, you should dry your craft project completely over a heater.
 Keep any unused glue in a tightly-sealed container in the refrigerator. The glue should last a week or two.


If the glue gets dry, add a little warm water to reuse it.

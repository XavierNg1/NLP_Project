 Go into the lobby for Bed Wars and choose a mode, teams of 3 or teams of 4. These are unique game modes which add more or less players to your team!;
, This is located at the back of your spawn cave, where, hence the name, you spawn.
 This costs a lot of gold, but it will keep you protected from enemies. It will take a while to get the required 20 gold for a sword and armor, but don't give up!

, This is very cheap and doesn't cost much at all at 4 iron ingots! And it is extremely important you get wool early on, so you can defend your bed and build to the middle, trap enemies, and so on.
 If your bed is destroyed, you won't be able to respawn, and if all your team dies, you lose! The area around it should be big (maybe 5x5), with plenty of layers; and NOT hollow. Try using wool, sandstone, wood and if you can afford it, obsidian for about 5 layers to annoy enemies and kill them while they mine towards your bed.
 This is important because if you communicate with your teammates, they are more likely to like you and help you out and you can even play more games together using /p invite (username)!

, You'll need diamonds for Team Upgrades, which help you and your team out, from sharp swords to more resources. You can even make enemies who enter your base blind!

, This is really important if you want OP gear such as diamond gear, obsidian and more.
 Then once all other teams have been eliminated, you have won! Congratulations!

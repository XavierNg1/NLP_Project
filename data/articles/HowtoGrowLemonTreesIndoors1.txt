 Meyer lemon trees are the most common for indoor growing and produce small to medium fruits with a strong flavor. Pink variegated lemon trees are another good option for beginners and produce lemons with pink flesh.;
, Shop at a nursery for a tree between two and three years in age. Planting a lemon tree from seed can be done, but is not recommended, since trees planted from seed may take a long time to grow and produce fruit.
 A 10 to 15 gallon (40 to 60 liter) container should give your tree plenty of room, and under average conditions, a lemon tree can grow up to 8 feet (2.4 meters) in a container that large.


If the container you choose does not have any drainage holes, drill one or two into the bottom.
 A store-bought, soil-based mix that is slightly acidic works best. Mix sand into the potting mix to allow for better drainage.


A potting mix with a base of peat moss can also work and presents a soil less alternative. These artificial mixes work even better when they contain compost.

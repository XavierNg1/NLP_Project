 If you think you might have tetanus, admit yourself to a hospital as soon as possible. In most cases, you will need to be hospitalized to treat a tetanus infection â€“ especially if it is severe., If possible, get treated with a prophylactic dose of human tetanus immune globulin (TIG) (or equine antitoxin).This should begin to halt the spread of tetanus through your system.


You do not need to wait for severe symptoms to seek treatment. If you have not been vaccinated and you think that you've been exposed to tetanus bacteria: consider getting the antitoxin.
 Penicillin, chloramphenicol, and other antimicrobial agents are commonly used to treat tetanus.You may also be given drugs to stabilize your muscle spasms.
 In very severe tetanus infections, drug treatment might be coupled with tissue debridement: the surgical removal of dead, damaged, or infected tissue.You should only go this route if it is recommended by a licensed and trusted physician. Be absolutely certain that the infection has spread too far to treat otherwise.
 Be aware that even after you've recovered from tetanus, you can still get reinfected at any point. Get the vaccine as soon as possible after the symptoms disappear. This will reduce the risk of lockjaw coming back. Continue to re-up with booster shots every ten years (at least) to keep yourself protected.

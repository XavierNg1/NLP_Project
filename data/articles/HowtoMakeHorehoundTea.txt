 Place the water on high heat and bring the water to a full boil.;
, A non-metal container is preferred, as a metal container can compromise the purity of the horehound tea as will plastic. Swish the hot water in the container, then pour the water down the sink.
 Horehound has essential oils that will evaporate with the steam, so steeping should be done while covered tightly. You can use a saucer, some tea cups come with a decorative cover for this purpose. Use 2 tablespoons of fresh horehound leaves for each cup of boiling water. Traditionally, one extra tablespoon of fresh leaves are added "for the pot." If you are making tea with dried horehound, use one tablespoon for each cup of boiling water, plus one tablespoon "for the pot."

, Check the tea often, as the steeping time will depend on if you prefer your horehound tea weak or strong.
 Garnish the horehound tea with honey, a sprig of peppermint, a small amount of fresh ginger or a lemon slice. A teaspoon of anise seed will provide a licorice flavor to your horehound tea.

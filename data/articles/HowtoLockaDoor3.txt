 You may have seen this in the movies â€“ and it really works! Bear in mind that this method only works if the door opens inward.Warning: If someone tries to force the door open from the outside, there is chance that the chair will break. This is a trick, not a fail-proof security system.
 Do not use a folding chair. Close the door and stand inside, so that the door opens toward you. Wedge the top of the back of the chair underneath the doorknob, between the knob and the door. The two front legs of the chair should not be touching the ground., The chair should apply pressure to the door, at an angle, focused just beneath the doorknob. This will make it much more difficult for a casual intruder to open the door.

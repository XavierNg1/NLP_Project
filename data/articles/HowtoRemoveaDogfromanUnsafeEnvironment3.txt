If you choose to adopt the dog, you will have to be prepared for the long term commitment. Buy it toys, bowls, dog food, water, etc. and make sure you have plenty of room in your home for it to roam.
If you choose not to adopt the dog, it will be sent to a local animal shelter to be adopted by someone else. Congratulations, though; you've just saved a life!

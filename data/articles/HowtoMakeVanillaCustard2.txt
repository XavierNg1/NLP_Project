 There are some recipes that call for as many as six eggs, which have a deep yellow color and thicker body. If you add more eggs, be sure to add a bit more sugar as well, about a tablespoon. An extra teaspoon of cornstarch, too, can help keep the custard together.
 A simple teaspoon of almond or cherry extract will quickly change the flavor profile of your desert. Similarly, a touch or spiced rum, chocolate liquor, or other strongly-flavored alcohols have long been used in custards. Add it after you've mixed the egg yolks in and stir well., The butter goes in towards the end, after you mixed in the eggs and the milk mixture. Simply stir it in until melted.
 Add these with the corn starch in the beginning and mix well. While you can't exactly call it "vanilla custard," you can drastically change up the desert with just this simple addition to the recipe.

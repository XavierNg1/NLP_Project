 Routinely check to make sure the filter is effectively cleaning debris from your pool. Keep the drain systems clear of debris to allow the water to flow freely and easily. Check the pump frequently to confirm water is circulating properly.


Use pool water test kits to maintain the proper pH and chlorine levels.
When chemicals need to be added, do it as far from the collector intake pipes as possible.
 The correct range for recreational use is 82-84°F and 78-80°F for more active swimming. If your temperatures are far above that, you are probably wasting energy. Buy a pool thermometer to help you monitor the temperature and reduce the pump speed when the water becomes too hot., Evaporation is responsible for the greatest loss of energy in pools. To prevent energy from being lost, keep the solar cover on the pool whenever it isn’t in use. The solar blanket will continue to collect energy from the sun and heat the water, while also preventing the heat from escaping.Pool covers block debris from entering the pool, which will reduce the pool’s cleaning time and chemical consumption.

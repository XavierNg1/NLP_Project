 The day before your wax, exfoliate the area. You don't need to use a special scrub. All you need is a washcloth or bath pouffe with soap. Make sure to do this at least a day before your wax.
 This is important for hygiene, since you should not shower for at least 24 hours after waxing. Don't use this time to exfoliate if you forgot to do so the day before.You do not want to cause unnecessary irritation right before a wax., This will ensure comfort after your wax. Cotton underwear and a dress is perfect.  

Avoid wearing tight fitting clothing like yoga pants or skinny jeans.
 For 24 hours: Avoid sex or other activities such as sitting in the bath or swimming for 24 hours after you wax. Open hair follicles are especially susceptible to bacteria and irritation during this time., During shower time, lightly exfoliate the area daily. This will help prevent ingrown hairs. Be gentle. You don't want to cause irritation. Again, you don't need a special scrub; a clean washcloth or shower pouffe will do.,

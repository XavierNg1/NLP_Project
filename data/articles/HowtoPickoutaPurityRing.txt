 A religious ring has references to Jesus, crosses, or bible verses. A non-religious purity ring generally has the motto "True Love Waits" and should be worn with just as much pride as a religious ring. A good program for this is "The Silver Ring Thing".;
, Another option is to walk around the mall and look for different jewelry stores. Look around at every store that you go to - you can "adapt" any silver ring into a purity ring. If you really like one silver ring, even if it doesn't say "True Love Waits," it means something to you and can be used to symbolize your promise. Pick a purity ring that fits your personality and means something to you.
 This will make it very easy to find rings instead of window shopping for rings that might be out of your price range. You will be surprised that the rings aren't that expensive, but there are some high-end ones as well. Decide whether you are going to splurge or go for a moderate price. Also, how will you wear the ring? Are you purchasing a chain to wear it on around your neck, or are you wearing it on your finger?

, If you have a ring that already fits your ring finger, you can print out a ring sizing chart and line it up with the right circle. If you can, try on the ring. Any jeweler or jewelry store will be able to help you size a ring.
 If you want, you can wear your ring on a necklace chain.

 Most real trees will be grown in your local area and won't have had to travel too far to reach your home. Most fake trees have been shipped all the way from China. That's a lot of extra energy miles.;
, Most artificial trees are made from metals and plastics. These leave a trail of toxins in the environment where they're produced. Your real tree is made of - tree. And if you look for organic growers, it won't have had pesticides sprayed on it either.
 Fake trees are not biodegradable although if well cared for, they can last a long time (but probably not longer than a living tree) - something you might want to balance in the equation. Your real tree can be chipped and used as mulch and is definitely biodegradable.
 Maybe you could prefer a tree that is living and one of your local biodiversity and plant it after it has been a Christmas helper. Buy a tree, in a pot, and plant it in your garden, or in a public area if you donâ€™t have a back yard, after Christmas. Or, simply repot it and bring it in again next year.

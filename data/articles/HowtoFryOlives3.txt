 Drain the olives, pit them if necessary, and pat them dry with a paper towel if they were jarred in any liquid other than oil. Roll small amounts of blue cheese into narrow log shapes. Stuff each olive with a small cheese log., Place the flour, egg, and breadcrumbs into three separate shallow dishes. Dredge the olives in the flour first, then in the egg, and in the breadcrumbs last. Let them rest for a minute so the coating can set., Cover a saucepan with 2 inches (5 cm) of oil. Heat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) over medium-high heat. Fry the olives until the coating is golden brown, or about 30 seconds., Use a slotted spoon to transfer the olives to a cooling rack or plate lined with paper towels. Let them rest for a few minutes so the paper towel can soak up the excess oil. Place the drained olives onto to a platter and serve them hot.Set a pair of tongs or a small glass jar of toothpicks next to the platter so your guests can serve themselves.

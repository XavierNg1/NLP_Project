 Eggs are a good source of vitamin B, which turns food into energy. You could try scrambled eggs, hardboiled eggs, or an over-easy egg on toast. For a lower cholesterol option, eat the egg whites only, not the yolk., Beans contain magnesium and carbs, both of which are great for providing energy. You could try black beans, pinto beans, or baked beans with rice for a quick and energizing midday snack.

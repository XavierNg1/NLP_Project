 Take stock in the number of delicate ornaments you would like to protect as well as the ornament shape and size.


Count the number of ornaments that could fit safely in a dozen egg container.;
, You can stock up on containers throughout the year and just store containers in your Christmas box or a closet. Go for the strong cardboard containers instead of the flimsy Styrofoam holders. You will maintain your ornaments inside the containers so make sure the surrounding material is strong.


Clean inside of containers and make sure all residue is eliminated. Most likely you will only need to brush away any debris inside the carton, however if you experienced an egg debacle, either carefully wash the inside of the carton to remove the matter or discard the carton and use the next one.






Inspect each carton for damage. The idea is to ensure a safe haven for your ornaments so any cracks, rips or tears on the carton should eliminate the carton from being a contender.
 You may also want to wrap each ornament in tissue paper for further protection, but if you are using a sturdy cardboard container your ornament should remain in good shape.


Close the egg carton using the pre-determined ridges once you have filled it with ornaments. If the fit isnâ€™t perfect, consider using tape around the edges or lightly wrap a rubber band around the carton.
 Storage will be easier this way as well because you can stack boxes neatly to avoid having the ornaments rolling around inside.

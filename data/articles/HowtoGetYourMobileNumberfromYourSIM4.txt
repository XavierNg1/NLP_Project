On the LG G4, you will need to tap the "General" tab first, then "About Phone.", Depending on your device, one of these two menu options will lead to your phone number., Scroll down the Status screen and you’ll find the “My phone number” field which shows your SIM card’s number.


If you do not see your number, look for "SIM Status." Tap that to view the final sub-menu where your number is displayed.

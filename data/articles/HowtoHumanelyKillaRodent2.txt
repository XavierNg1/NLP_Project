 The aim of this method is to destroy the rodent's brain with one swift, powerful blow to the head from a hammer or other blunt striking object. This can be very daunting and/or emotionally taxing. If you doubt whether you can kill the rodent in one blow, seriously consider other options. There is risk of causing much more pain and distress if you carry this out badly., Some colloquial methods, like putting the rodent in a bag and smashing it against a wall or stomping it haphazardly are not humane. They can result in a painful and protracted death for the rodent.
 You also want to be sure you have a clear shot when you strike. One useful method is to confine the rodent in one corner of a sturdy sack or bag before striking.


The humaneness of this technique depends on force and accuracy.

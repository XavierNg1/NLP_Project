 You can determine the game mode by going to the pre-game screen and viewing the goal of the level. From the game map, click or tap on a level to see its pre-game screen.;
, Click or tap on the “Play” button to start the level. The main goal will again be displayed before you can begin.
 Each level can have a different target for its main goal. In this game mode, the number of soda bottles you need to match or clear is indicated in the upper portion of the screen.
 Start playing the level. Focus on the targets, and do not just attack the game board. Look for the soda bottles you need to clear and work on getting to them as fast as you can.


Soda bottles can be cleared just like any of the candies in Candy Crush Saga, by matching it with similar-colored candies. Each soda bottle you clear increases the soda level. In the soda, candies will rise instead of fall as you clear them.
 Aside from the main goal, every level requires you to meet a certain minimum score in order to move to the next level. If you’ve successfully completed the goal, but didn’t meet the required score, you will still lose the game. Go for huge combos and cascading matches to get some bonus scores.

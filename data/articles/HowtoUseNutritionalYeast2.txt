 Many vegan sauces, especially those with cheese in them, use nutritional yeast as a substitute. Replace equal amounts of nutritional yeast for shredded cheese in recipes.

For non-dairy versions of cheesy dishes, like cheesy rice, cheesy pasta, or cheesy vegetables, mix in nutritional yeast to the food immediately after it is removed from the heat. If the dish is dry, drizzle olive oil over it before mixing in the yeast., When preparing a store bought or homemade pizza, leave out the cheese. Instead, lightly sprinkle nutritional yeast on top of the pizza. When the pizza comes out of the oven, the yeast will have melted to a cheesy consistency., Make mashed potatoes as you would normally. When the potatoes are well mashed, mix in nutritional yeast. The more yeast you use, the nuttier the flavor and the stringier the consistency.

You may be able to achieve a richer consistency in your vegan “cheesy” mashed potatoes by adding a tablespoon (15 ml) of butter to the potatoes.
Dishes of a similar consistency to mashed potatoes, like scrambled eggs, can also be made into vegan friendly “cheesy” recipes in the same fashion described for mashed potatoes.

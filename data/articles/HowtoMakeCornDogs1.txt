 Open the package of hot dogs, rinse them off, and pat them dry with a paper towel. Hold a hot dog in one hand and place a skewer at its tip. Push the skewer carefully through the length of the hot dog, stopping about 2 inches (5.1Â cm) from the other end. Repeat with the remaining hot dogs.









Try to get the skewer to slide straight through the hot dog, so it doesn't poke out through the side.
If your hot dogs are heavy, you might want to slide the skewer closer to the other tip.;
, In a large mixing bowl, mix the cornmeal, flour, baking powder and salt. Use a whisk to combine the ingredients well. Pour in the milk, eggs and sugar. Whisk the batter until it is smooth with very few lumps.
 This makes the corn dogs easier to coat evenly with batter.
 Pour the oil into a large dutch oven or stockpot. Place it on a burner and turn the heat to medium high. Heat the oil until it reaches 360 degrees. Test to see whether the oil is ready to fry by using a candy thermometer.









If you don't have a candy thermometer, place the handle of a wooden spoon in the oil; if you see bubbles rising from the spoon, the oil is ready.
Be sure not to fry the corn dogs until the oil is ready. If you try, the batter will simply fall off the dogs.

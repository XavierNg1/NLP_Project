 Wearing helmets are a must and are worn for safety and sometimes to identify opposing teams.

Starting the Game
Each team starts on the wall of their respective side with 7 players: 6 fielders and one goalkeeper. To start the game, the referee blows the whistle and throws the ball in at the center line represented by a white mark on the side of the pool deck. The two sprinters are the players closest to the side to where the ref threw the ball, and are usually the team's fastest swimmers. The two teams race each other to be in possession of the ball and either pass or hand the ball off the the chaser, who follows the sprinter.

Gameplay Rules
After the first possession is taken, a shot clock is started for 30 seconds in which the team must score or the possession of the ball is changed resulting in a new shot clock. Possession changes when the time is up.

Fouls and Penalties
Fouls in water polo vary from simple possession changes to full on ejections:


Minor Foul
These are very common in water polo and result in a free pass. Play is not stopped for these fouls. They include mild grabbing and pushing. If a defender commits the foul, the fouled player gets a free pass to a team-mate, but can be blocked after the ball leaves the player's hands. If the offense commits the foul, then the ball changes possession with a free pass.

Major Foul
These are fouls when a defender is overly aggressive on a player and result in being kicked out of the game until 20 seconds pass or until a possession change. They include grabbing, kicking, pushing underwater, and preventing movement. When committed, the attacking team is awarded a free pass and the defending team must play a player down.

, The front center position is the Set who the ball is trying to be passed too and is given the #6. The outside positions of the front line are the wings and given the numbers 1 and 5. The back center position is the point and is given the number 3. The outside back positions are the flats, or drivers and drive for the goal when the set is fouled. The flats are given the numbers 2 and 4.

2-4 Setup
The 2-4 is a set up when the team has man up. Like the 3-3 there are 2 lines. The front has 4 players and the back 2. Position names can greatly vary so here's a chart with the numbers.
--------/Goal\--------
--(1)-(2)--(3)--(4)--

------(5)----(6)------

, When the Whistle is blown the sprinter goes after ball and is followed by the tailer. If the sprinter gets possession of the ball, then he either passes it to and open player, or if pressed, to the tailer behind him. The offense then set up a 3-3 and continues from there. If the sprint is lost then the sprinter defends the opposing tailer, and the tailer defends the opposing sprinter. The other players also take action accordingly.

3-3 Offensive Tactics
After the sprint or possession change, the team will attempt to set up a 3-3.
--------/Goal\--------
----(1)---(6)---(5)---
----------------------
----(2)---(3)---(4)---
----------------------
The ball is usually started from the 2,3 or 4 positions. By passing the ball around the perimeter, the team tries to get to a position where the ball can get passed to set (6). The Set will then either have a shot on the goal, or get fouled. If fouled, it is the flats' (2 and 4) responsibility to drive toward the cage for a pass and then a shot. If no pass is made, the flats become the wings and the wings move back to the flats and the process is repeated.

2-4 Offensive tactics
The 2-4 set up is used when the opposing team is a man down, do to a foul or brutality..
--------/Goal\--------
--(1)-(2)--(3)--(4)--
----------------------
------(5)----(6)------
----------------------
The front line of the set up is on the 2-meter line and the rear about 5 meters (16.4Â ft) out. The 2 and 3 positions are on the posts of the goal. These are the equivalent of a set in a 3-3. The point is to get the ball to the 2 or 3 for a shot or for the 5 or 6 positions to get close enough to shoot. The tactics for offense are much the same as a 3-3 with the exception that there is no drive when a player is fouled.

Man to Man Defense
This defense is used most often when each team has the same amount of players on the field and the way it works is to make it so there is no one for the offense to pass to. Each player chooses one player from the opposing team to guard and prevent a pass from reaching them. When played correctly, the offense will have the shot clock run out, or a pass will be blocked

Zone defense
This defense method is used when the other team is a man up, or in circumstances where normal position line ups are broken. The basis of this defense is to guard the players with a good shot at the goal if passed to, and react effectively if the ball is passed to an open player. The main objective in this defense is to always keep the inside water, so that if the ball is passed to someone on the perimeter, their chance of making a goal is reduced. When played effectively, the shot-clock will expire, or the only shots available on the goal will be from the out side and easily blockable.

 Before you begin making baked lamb meatballs, you will need to preheat your oven. Turn your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit or 190 degrees Celsius. Allow the oven to reach this temperature before baking your lamb meatballs., You will need a muffin tin that will fit 12 meatballs. Line the muffin tin with 12 paper muffin tin liners. If you do not have paper liners, you can grease the muffin tin with a little bit of olive or vegetable oil.
 In a large mixing bowl, combine one pound of lamb, ¼ cup of diced yellow onion, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon allspice, 1 teaspoon sea salt, and ½ teaspoon cinnamon. Use your hands to combine the ingredients until the spices have mixed evenly throughout the meat., Once you have combined the meat, onion, and spices, use your hands to mix in the egg and almond flour. Gently massage the mixture until all the ingredients are combined. Take care to not over-mix the ingredients. You should still be able to see chunks of lamb in the mixture., Use your hands to gently roll the mixture into meatballs. You will want to make sure you divide the mixture evenly to form 12 equally sized meatballs. Place the meatballs in the prepared muffin tin.
 If your oven has preheated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, or 190 degrees Celsius, it is time to bake the meatballs. Place the meatball-filled muffin tin in the oven. Bake the meatballs for 20 minutes, remove from the oven, and enjoy!,

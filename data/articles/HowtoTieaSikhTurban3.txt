 You will be able to wrap with both hands if you hold one end in your mouth. Hold it in the left side of your mouth.
 Start on the left side, and come up high on the right side. Come around the top of the knot.
 As you come around the left side, wrap the turban low, covering the top part of your ear.
 On the right side, go lower on each wrap. On the left side, go higher on each wrap.
 As you wrap, a peak will begin to form on the front of your head. Wrap the end around the peak. It will look like the center of a bow, as the end will pinch the peak. Each side comes out wider than the middle.









This type of knot was used by kings.
 Pull the other end around the back. Pull it up over the crown of the head, covering the exposed part of the patka. Tuck it under the top folds.
 Stretch out the turban so it fits well over all parts of your head.

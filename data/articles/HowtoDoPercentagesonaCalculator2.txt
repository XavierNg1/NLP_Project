 Because percentages all represent fractions with the common denominator of 100, you can add a list of percentages without any additional work. By contrast, remember that to add fractions, you must work through the steps of finding common denominators and converting your fractions to those common denominators. With percentages, however, no additional work is necessary. Just add the numbers together.


For example, if each of six people draws a portion of the company’s payroll, you can find out how much they represent together by just adding the relative percentages. If their respective shares are 10%, 5%, 8%, 22%, 10% and 8%, you can just add 10+5+8+22+10+8 = 63. Those six people make up 63% of the company’s payroll.
When you are adding, ignore the percent symbol, and just add the numbers. Put the symbol back in your final answer.
 Again, because percentages represent fractions with the common denominator of 100, you do not need to do any additional work to subtract percentages. If you are working the the concept of removing some percentage from an original whole item, you should represent the whole item with the number 100 (because the whole means 100%).


For example, suppose you want to calculate an income percentage. 100% represents the entire income from some project, but then you must subtract, for example, 10% for expenses, 12% for salaries, and 25% for taxes. How much is left? Simply use your calculator to perform the subtraction of 100-10-12-25. The result is 53%.
 If you have a problem that is initially written as 25% x 30, just write the 25% as its decimal equivalent 0.25 and conduct the operation. This would be 0.25 x 30 which gives the result of 7.5. Similarly, if you have a division problem of 200 ÷ 10%, rewrite this as 200 ÷ 0.10 and enter this into your calculator. You will get the result of 2000.


The last result may appear surprising, if you expect division to produce a smaller result than the starting number. However, you should understand that division by a number less than one will always lead to an increase by the reciprocal of that number. For example, dividing by 1/10 is the same as multiplying by 10. Dividing by 1/2 is the same as multiplying by 2.

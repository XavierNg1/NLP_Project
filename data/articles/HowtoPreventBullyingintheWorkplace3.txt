 Workplace bullying is a behavior that is ongoing in nature. The bullying is repeated, systematic, and damaging. This damage can come in the form of emotional, mental, or physical harm.


A repeated and systematic offence is when a bully takes a methodical approach to bullying a victim over and over again.
 Examples of bullying behavior could include:


Insulting or offensive language
Attitude or language that humiliates, frightens, criticizes or degrades someone else through yelling, screaming or through soft spoken but demeaning words.
Practical jokes or teasing on a regular basis that hurt the victim, either emotionally, mentally, or physically.
Displaying degrading or offending material.
Spreading rumors or gossip about another employee.
 Subtle behavior may include deliberately excluding a person from routine activities, intruding on employee’s personal space via spying or tampering with their equipment, or intimidating another employee through belittling opinions and inappropriate comments.
 This sort of behavior includes setting unrealistic timelines, overloading another employee with work, deliberately drawing back access to resources and information or giving unfair treatment to workplace entitlements.
 While the person that these actions are taken against may think they are not fair, the following actions are not considered bullying.


A reasonable decision undertaken to transfer, discipline, counsel or dismiss an employee.
Employer’s decision not to promote or benefit an employee based on an objective assessment.
 Workplace bullying may range from verbal and emotional abuse to physical abuse and humiliation. Many of the reported cases have been committed by management that ultimately puts employees in an awkward position.


Other forms of bullying are committed by employees against other employees. This may include discounting employee’s opinion and making false statements regarding their performance in front of others.

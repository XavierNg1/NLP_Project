 If you want to create high-quality recordings of your Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii U, or any other game console, you'll want to use a capture device that records video to your computer. These consoles don't have built-in recording options, and a capture device will result in a perfect recording. Some of the more popular capture devices include:Hauppauge HD PVR 2
Elgato Game Capture HD
Blackmagic Intensity
AVerMedia Live Gamer Extreme

, The process for this varies depending on the capture device you are using. Typically the software will come on a disc with the capture device. If you don't have the disc, you can download the software from the manufacturer's support site., Most capture devices will connect to your computer via USB. Try to use a USB 3.0 port if you have one for the best performance. Do not plug it into a USB hub, as this will usually slow things down too much., Plug the game console's video and audio cables into the capture device instead of your TV, using the IN ports., Use the OUT ports on the capture device to connect it to the TV. This will pass the signal from your console through the capture box back to the TV, allowing the capture box to record the signal in between., After everything is hooked up properly, start the recording software that came with your capture device. The interface will vary depending on the capture device you are using., Start playing your game on the console. You should see a small version of your TV's display in the recording program on the computer. Once you're at a spot that you want to start recording, click the Record button in the capture program. Depending on your settings, the video may be saved to your Videos folder or another location on your computer.

 Fingerprints can leave smudges on the lens. Every time you touch the lens, you risk damaging it.To prevent the need for extra cleaning, keep your fingers off the lens.
 Most monoculars have either a neck or wrist strap. If you are using your monocular during an activity such as kayaking, hiking, or hunting, you should secure the strap to your body. This will prevent your monocular from dropping and breaking.
 If you have a non-waterproof monocular, you can still take it out near the water if you are careful. Protect your monocular by keeping it in a sealed ziplock bag or dry bag while it is not in use., If your monocular came with a cap, you should make sure that it is capped while you are not looking through it. Even if you have a strap securing your monocular, a cap can prevent damage from wind, sand, dirt, and water.
 When you are looking through your monocular, you should be sitting or standing still. Do not use it while walking, paddling, or driving. Not only might you collide into another object, damaging your monocular, but you may also end up injuring yourself. This is particularly true while focusing or adjusting your monocular.

 With your curtains hung in place, measure the required drop. Mark the position where the curtains should fall using pins. Always double check your measurements before cutting and sewing.;
, Take down the curtains and unpick the stitches that join the lining to the curtain, going sufficiently high to allow you to work on the two new hems.


Make a note of the measurements of the existing curtain and lining hems, so that you can make the new hems the same size. These will often be double hems.
 Unpick the curtain hem, and trim excess fabric, allowing for the need to create a double hem if necessary. Turn it up to the marked length.


Check that it is level using the tape measure, then press.

Slip stitch in place. Repeat with the lining hem.
 Slip stitch the curtain and lining to re-join them.

 Not all experiences cost money, but having enough money to meet your needs is essential to being comfortable straying from your routine. Look for new things to do that cost little or no money, and save money to afford more expensive experiences.


Low budget experiences might include things like going to a local open mic night. In contrast, you might need to save if you want to go to a big concert that is coming to town in a few months.
 The fear of trying new experiences is often rooted in the idea that the experience has to turn out “good.” If you view each experience as a chance to learn something new about the world and yourself, you can eliminate the fear that the unknown will be “bad.” Think about what you can learn from an experience that you are considering, whether you like it or not.For example, if you are going to order a new food on the menu, you should think of it as an opportunity to learn more about food options and personal tastes. This way, if you don’t like the food, you won’t consider the experience a failure.
 There is an infinite number of experiences to try. If you want to gain the most from doing things that you have never done before, choose experiences that matter to you. Take suggestions from other people, but make the decision to try new things that you are curious about.For example, say your friends went to Bali and highly recommend you go, but you have always wanted to see Ireland. Take a trip to Ireland first, and then, if the opportunity presents itself, consider taking a trip to Bali.

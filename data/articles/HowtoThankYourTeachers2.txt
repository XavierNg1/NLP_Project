 You don’t need to feel like your gift needs to be expensive or extravagant. Giving a gift to your teacher to say thank you is already going above and beyond, so think about giving a handmade gift. Gifts that represent an inside joke or are from a favorite local business are great choices.


Think about what would be easiest for you to give. If you’re good at baking, try making cookies or cupcakes for them. Or, if you are creative and had them for a year long high school class, you might make a scrapbook or a photobook of your time in their class., Even if you feel like you bonded with your teacher, don’t gift them personal items like perfumes or bath products. This can turn the gift from thoughtful to awkward quickly. Also avoid scented items like candles, as those are extremely taste-specific, and you might guess wrong, leaving your teacher with a scented candle they can't use., If you can, a good way to show your appreciation to a K-12 teacher is to donate something back to their classroom. This doesn’t have to be monetary. You can donate some classroom supplies or you can donate your time. Volunteering to help them clean out their classroom or to help them with student projects is a great way to show your appreciation., If you aren’t close enough to your teacher or professor to know exactly what to give them, a gift card of a small amount to somewhere like Amazon, Starbucks, or a local shop or restaurant is always a safe bet. Don’t give a huge amount because that’s inappropriate for a gesture of thanks for a teacher.Giving your teacher a gift as a way of saying thank you is definitely a situation where the old saying “it’s the thought that counts” applies. The fact that you even made the effort is what they’ll remember, not the precise dollar amount of your gift or gift card. Shoot for $20 or less as a general rule, and even a $5 gift card would be appreciated.

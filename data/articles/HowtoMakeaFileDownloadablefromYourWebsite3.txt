 Log into the Weebly site and open your web page in the Weebly editor.
 You can highlight text in a text field or select an image on your page that you want to turn into the download link for your file.
 When you have text selected, this looks like a chainlink, and can be found at the top of the text editor. When you have an image selected, click "Link" in the image control panel.
 This will open the file browser.
 Once you select the file, it will begin uploading.


Basic users are limited to files 5 MB and smaller. Premium users have a 100 MB file size limit.
 After uploading the file, the link will be ready to use. Click the Publish button to push your changes to the live site. Your visitors will now be able to click the link and download the file.

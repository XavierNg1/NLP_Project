 If you are unsure whether your dishwasher has a built-in unit, contact your manufacturer. If you can’t find it on the bottom of the dishwasher, you probably don’t have one. Don’t put dishwasher salt into other spots marked for normal detergent or dishwasher cleaner. This could easily break your appliance.

Most dishwashers in the United States do not have built-in softener units that need to be filled with salt. Only select models come with this feature., The easiest way to know if your dishwasher needs more salt is for it to tell you that it’s ready for a refill! Many dishwashers have an indicator light either on the top panel of the dishwasher and/or on the unit itself. If your lights are green, they’re good to go. If your indicator lights are red (or, on the unit itself, clear), then you’re ready to pour in more salt., If your dishwasher doesn’t have indicator lights, it’s up you to make your own schedule. It’s a good idea to refill the salt about once per month in dishwashers that contain built-in units. Even if you have indicator lights, you may want to do a refill if it’s been over a month.If you notice that your indicator lights are taking more than a month to tell you to refill the unit, they may be broken. Check your unit levels, and call your manufacturer if you’re concerned.
 Monitor your dishes to keep an eye on the water softness. If your water is getting too hard, you’ll start getting streaky dishes that look like they have a white film on them. This will be especially obvious on clear glasses. Top off the reservoir with salt to restore that pretty sparkle to your wine glasses!

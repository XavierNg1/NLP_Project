Things like meditation, exercise, and spiritual practices can help you recenter yourself on who you want to be.Try making a list of your values to figure out what type of person you strive to be. Look over this list often to remind yourself.;
, When your goals are specific and achievable you are more apt to meet them and feel good about it. On the other hand, if you goals are vague and unrealistic you are more likely to get frustrated and forego all of your goals.For example, going to the dentist twice a year is a specific and achievable goal. On the other hand, improving your health is too broad and vague.
 Eliminate things that stress you out and slow you down. Try to be one step ahead instead of one step behind. Being prepared will help you feel less stressed and overwhelmed. Create routines for yourself that promote success.Prepare for the next day the night before. Lay out your clothes or pack your lunch.

Come prepared to meetings.
Keep in mind that success is not a straight line. You will sometimes have setbacks, and this is all part of progressing towards your goal.

 Discuss the status of your puppy’s vaccinations before taking your puppy to walk in public areas that are shared with other dogs.Be sure to keep your puppy on a leash for her own safety.
 Give your puppy the opportunity to chew on an appropriate chew toy. Praise her for taking and playing with the toy.


If your puppy seems unsure about the chew toy, try putting a little tuna juice or peanut butter on it to make it more enticing.
 If your dog begins playing too roughly, you can give her a “time out” from playing for a while, even before a bite occurs.

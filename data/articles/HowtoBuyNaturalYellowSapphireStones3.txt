 Some sapphires often contain some space inside them, which on slicing may showcase imperfection. Although some jewelers leave the space as it is, but some fraudulent ones fill the gap with borax paste or dust of glass to add on to the weight of the stone. Patches of unevenness is considered as a good indication of this swindling practice.
 Foil backing adds on to the deep colorization and luster that makes the stone look brighter than ever. The backing could be really hard to notice any difference from naked eyes, but by examining the base of the stone with a magnifying glass can often reveal a foil backing. This type of practice is more common in antique type of jewelry, hence observe them carefully.
 Always purchase a gemstone from a provider who is certified to sell gemstones. However, the certification may not give you the surety of genuineness like physical checking of the stone might, but it does provide you the satisfaction that the gem is approved of the officials of a trusted organization.

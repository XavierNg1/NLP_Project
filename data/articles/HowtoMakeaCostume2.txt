 The size of the sheet will depend on the size of the person wearing the costume.
 Place it over the intended wearer and use a black pen to mark where the eye holes go. Take the sheet off and cut 1 1/2"x2" holes for the eyes. The holes can be bigger or smaller, as desired.
 Cut off the seams on the sheet, in a rough, uneven manner. Then use a soapstone, steel wool, or other rough object an rub in all along the edge. This will make it look old and worn.
 You can also add additional details. Stain the sheets with some tea, or splash on some fake blood. Get chains from your local hardware store and wrap them around the costume wearer's shoulders. You can even get glow in the dark paint from the craft store and paint on a ghoulish face!

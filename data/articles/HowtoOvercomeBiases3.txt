 Biased opinions are often formed in the early years of life, and they are difficult to overcome. If you want to beat your biases, you will have to commit to it as a long term goal. Make a list of any biases you identify, and create steps to work against them.For example, if you find that you are biased against a particular culture, try going to a restaurant that serves food from that culture.
Ask yourself why you feel this bias. If you can identify the roots and triggers of your biases, you will understand them and be better equipped to overcome them.
 Your brain is programmed to weigh negative thoughts and emotions more than positive ones. This was a survival mechanism for early humans, though it doesn’t serve us today. So regardless of what kind of bias or negative thoughts you are having, make a point to counter them by holding positive, anti-biased thoughts for a longer period of time.For example, from a survival standpoint, it was more beneficial for our ancestors' brains to remember something dangerous (e.g. a tiger) than something that creates pleasant feelings (e.g. a pretty flower).
 When you assume that something fits in every situation or applies to every member of a group of people, you are inevitably going to see things that contradict that. Instead of ignoring or rationalizing such things, make a note of them. These contradictions help to break down your biased opinions so that your mind can move past them.For example, if you notice a homeless person doing work for food, make a note of the incident. This can help break down any biased thoughts about homeless people being lazy.
 If you know that you have strong biases but can’t move past them, you may need professional help. A good counselor can help you find the root of your biased opinions and give you guidance to move beyond them. They can also help you learn coping mechanisms in the meantime.

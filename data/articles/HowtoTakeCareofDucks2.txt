 Ducks will eat frequently throughout the day. Rather than establishing a specific feeding time, allow them constant access to food. Domesticated ducks typically eat pellet mash. You can also feed your ducks chopped vegetables and worms (of any variety) as the occasional treat.You should be able to buy a good-quality poultry feed at your local pet store or farm-supply store.
Do not give your ducks medicated food. This type of poultry food is engineered to be given to hens in a poultry farm to stop the spread of disease. Feeding medicated food to your ducks could harm their health.
 Ducks need constant access to water. Not only do they drink about 1 liter (0.25 gallons) of water a day, but they also need water to help them swallow and digest their food.Provide the ducks with water in a metal dish, and place this next to a similar dish containing the ducks’ pellet mash food.


If the ducks have immediate access to a pond or lake in their enclosure, they will be less reliant on you to provide them with drinking water.
 Ducks are messy, unclean animals; they defecate frequently and, unlike cats and dogs, cannot be trained to use one specific area for their bathroom. In order to keep the ducks’ shed clean and to maintain their good health, you’ll need to scoop out all of the duck feces from the floor of their living area. Also, change their food and water and wash the shed walls as necessary.Cleaning the shed is even more important in the winter, since ducks will be spending more time inside of the shed and less time outside. You may need to clean the shed multiple times a day.
The more ducks you have, the more often you will need to clean the shed.

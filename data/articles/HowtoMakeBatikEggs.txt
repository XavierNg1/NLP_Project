 If blowing the egg, do so by making a small hole both ends of the egg, using a pin. Blow out the content (use some strength) and keep the egg and yolk for cooking.


Bear in mind that blown eggs are a lot more fragile than whole boiled eggs.

, If you're not using food dye, you'll need to make your own from crepe paper. Cut the crepe paper into strips about 1"/2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) wide. Put them into a bowl and cover with hot water. This will release the dye.
 Add one tablespoon of white vinegar; this sets the dye. Allow to cool before using.
 Any area of the egg where you don't want the dye to color should have wax or crayon on it.


Drip candle wax for clear egg color to show through. The wax is hot, so take care using it and if working with children, do the hot wax part yourself and then let them use crayons on the egg if needed.
 Start with the lightest dye first, gradually building up to the darkest choice over subsequent layers.
 Leave it in the dye until the dye takes and is the desired color.
, Hold the egg to the side of the candle to melt off the wax. Soak up the melting wax from the egg with paper towels or a soft cloth. Be gentle so as to avoid scratching or marring the design on the surface.


An alternative method to remove the wax is to place the egg in the oven at a moderate setting (350ºF/180ºC). The wax will melt in about two minutes and it can be quickly wiped off with paper towel on removing the egg from the oven.
 Simply follow the steps outlined above up to five times (putting wax on, dipping in dye, removing wax with heat) and graduating from lightest to darkest dye colors.
 They make wonderful additions to Easter baskets, Easter displays or simply added to an Easter table for a quick decoration.


Be aware that with each subsequent layer, it may take longer for the darker dyes to take; just be patient.

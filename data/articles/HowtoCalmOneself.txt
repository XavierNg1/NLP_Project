 Just breathe. Slowly. Breathe in for 5 seconds; hold for 5 seconds and then out for 5 seconds. This works because you are doing the opposite of what an excited person would be doing.;
, Feet flat on the floor, arms by your side, hands in your lap. This also works because you are then doing the opposite of what an excited person would be doing.
 It may help to invent this scene before you are... not calm, or you will have a mental blank. This works because you are not visualizing your fears and feeding your excitement.
 Worrying won't get you anywhere or help you achieve anything so why waste your energy. Easier said than done, yes but if you can feel yourself beginning to worry just think about something else. Worries are familiar paths to travel in our brain, and easy for us to follow. If you have a concern, and you can do something about it right now, do it. If not, it will keep.
 If you know are worked up, then you can ignore or get over what agitates you.
 Chances are, if you're not calm and you don't want to keep it that way (eg: you wouldn't want to be calm if you were ecstatic), you're stressed, angry or depressed. If you're having fun and generally enjoying life, scenarios which cause these feelings will appear less often. So laugh at life and have fun. You only live this life once.

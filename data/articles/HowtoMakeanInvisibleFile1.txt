 You'll need to create a regular file here first.;
,, "Folder" or "Text Document" are quick and simple choices.
,,,,, Your file is now hidden, meaning it won't show up in search queries or your File Explorer app; however, if you create a regular folder in the same directory with the same name, it will rename itself to be "Filename (2)", which betrays the fact that you have a hidden folder in that directory.


Your file is also literally invisible unless your computer is currently displaying hidden files and folders.

 Learn not only the names, faces, and positions of its players, managers, and owners, but their personal histories as well. Find out what other teams they belonged to before joining yours. Go over recent seasons to see how new members helped or hurt their game, and how the loss of other players may have done the same. Dive into the off-the-field drama of scandals, backroom politics, and draft picks to round out your knowledge of the team as a whole.
 You don’t have to memorize the stats of every single player who ever played for them since the team was founded (although this will probably impress people if you do), but at least familiarize yourself with the team’s general history. For instance, you don’t want to claim to be a diehard L.A. Dodgers fan and then be called out for not knowing that the Dodgers were once based in Brooklyn. Memorize such basic facts as pennants they have won in the past, former players who were inducted into the Hall of Fame, and those players who weren’t inducted but should have been according to other fans.
 Even if you are unable to watch every single game, provide ample time in your life to keep up-to-date on their performance so far. Stay informed about who is injured and otherwise underperforming. Devote a chunk of your brain to planning how you would personally strategize future games based on current predicaments.
 Use “we” instead of “they” when talking about the team. True, you aren’t technically part of the team, but you are a fan and part of the franchise, so think of your team as extended family whose every action effects you personally. Allow yourself to be swept up in the drama. Revel in their victories as if they symbolize your own. Take it to heart when they make mistakes. Participate in casual debates, online forums, and call-in shows to share your opinions and argue with others.

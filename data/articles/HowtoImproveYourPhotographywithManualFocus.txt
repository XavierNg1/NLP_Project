 You may need to check your manual to find its location. Most of the newer models will have it.;
, This will allow you to see the difference they make. Like, a landscape photo versus a macro photo or a portrait.
 There are a variety of ways to check or find out.


Look at the side of the lens. A lot of the newer lens have a switch on the side where you can turn manual focus off and on.
Try out the lens. If it's an older lens, even just a few years older, and the camera is not very old, your lens may be a manual focus because it doesn't have an autofocus with that particular camera.
Use an old style lens on the camera. Be extremely careful with this option. There are electronics in the lens and the camera that there weren't before. You can easily find yourself ruining one, or both, of them, if you aren't careful.
 Since you are relying on the manual focus, it forces you to do it, but think about what you are doing.
 If it helps, get out a ruler and measure it. Then set your camera accordingly.

 Lay them down so that the long side of the paper is facing you.
 Smooth the fold to get the paper as flat as possible.
 Go the same direction as the previous fold. Take the top edge of the paper and bring it to the bottom. Smooth the fold again.
 Continue folding in the same direction. You should end up with a long strip of folded paper.
 Starting about 1/3 of the way from each end of the strip, fold each end of the long strip down at a 90 degree angle. You should end up with a shape that looks like the letter 'n.'

, You should now have a piece that resembles a 'r' shape. This piece will become a handle for your gun.
 Create a long, tight cylindrical shape.You want the tube to be relatively tight to produce a realistic looking barrel. By rolling the paper you create the look of the Colt handguns. Pinch the middle of length of the tube and fold the piece in half so the round openings at the ends are even., Hold the handle at the base of the longer segment. Take one folded side of the barrel and slide it over the bottom segment of the handle and under the top segment. Take the other folded side of the barrel and slide it over the bottom of the handle and under the top segment.
 You don't want it so tight that it ruins the shape of your double barrels. You just want to adjust the gun to the proper shape.

 Open the lid, unwind the power cord and plug it in to the nearest outlet. Leave the power setting knob on the off position until you are ready to fill it with chicken thighs.

If desired, place a slow cooker liner into the pot and fold the excess over the edges of the pot. The excess liner will be on the outside of the slow cooker.;
, Prepared chicken broth can be used or a chicken bullion cube can be dissolved in 1 cup of boiling water., Sprinkle a generous amount of garlic powder, seasoning salt and pepper to the top of all chicken thighs. There is no need to rub in or add butter or oil to the chicken thighs., The chicken thighs will touch during the cooking process. Do not flip them over. This will take off some of the seasoning. It is important that the seasonings stay on the top of the chicken thighs while cooking to create a slight crispy top., Cook on low for 6 hours. The chicken thighs will be cooked through and will pierce easily with a fork. The top of the chicken thighs that were not in the chicken broth will be a little crispy.

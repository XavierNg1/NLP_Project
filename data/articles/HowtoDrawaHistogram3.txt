 We recommend using this one.
 There is a drop down menu at the top of the chart that gives you a few basic sample charts that you can fill with your own data. Alternatively, you can build one completely from scratch.
 You will see a box labeled "Title" towards the middle of the page. You should title your chart there.
 You will see a large box below the title bar, towards the bottom of the page. Enter each data point that you have, with one data point per line (so...5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 15, 15, 20, 20, 25, etc).
 Click the Update Data button above the data box.
 The chart should automatically adjust to your data, but you can also manually set the interval size and the maximums and minimums for the axes.
 Use the print screen function on your keyboard to take a picture of the completed graph. Paste and crop the image in MS Paint or whatever basic image software came with your computer. Save the image and print it if you want to.

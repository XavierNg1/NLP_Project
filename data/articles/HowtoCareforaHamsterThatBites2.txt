 Hamsters don’t like being touched or handled by unfamiliar people. When you get a new hamster, slowly ease into putting your hands near it. This will condition him to your presence, and prevent nervous biting.When you first introduce a hamster to its new cage, leave it alone for a few days to get accommodated to these new surroundings without you.
After a few days, slowly place your hand in the cage when the hamster is awake. Don’t go near it. Instead, let the hamster come to you. Treats can be a good way to encourage your hamster to check out your hand.

 In Greek language, there can be no wrong pronunciation if you know how to pronounce the individual letters correctly: each Greek letter has one and only one pronunciation, except for some limited combinations of letters who are paired (see below) and give a different pronunciation. So in greek, putting random letters together can very well produce a pronounceable word, albeit it being a nonsensical word (just like above).


Greek diphthongs (two letters that are pronounced as a single sound). There is a symbol for the separation of these letters to sound like individuals. The symbol is ¨ (διαλυτικά) and the second letter goes between the dots. Diphthongs and examles of ¨ are as follows:

αι as e in "left". On the other hand, αϊ is pronounced "α-ee" (α ι)
ει as i in "quit". On the other hand, εϊ is pronounced "e-ee" (ε ι)
οι also as i in "quit". οϊ is pronounced o-ee (ο ι)
αυ as af in "after" or "av" in "aviator", depending on the word. αϊ is pronounced α-ee (α υ)
ευ as ef in "left" or "ev" in "evolution" depending on the word. εϋ is pronounced e-ee (ε υ)
ου as oo in "loose". οϋ is pronounced o-ee (ο υ)

;
, The mark ' (called tonos - τόνος) written over a vowel and makes it stand out in the word, for example if "evolution" was a Greek word, a ' would be written over u (evolUtion). In "American", over e (amErican). In "University" over e (univErsity) etc. So the word "αεροπλάνο" is pronounced "aeroplAno". You emphasize the a. If a word has only 1 vowel, there is no need for the ' mark.
 This is a relic of an ancient diphthong and is not pronounced, but must be written.

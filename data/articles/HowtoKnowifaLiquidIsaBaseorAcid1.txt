 Acids and bases are well known for neutralizing each other on contact. This neutralization reaction can be recognized because it releases heat and gas, which causes the two reactants to fizz. Choose a well known, safe acid to do this reaction. Put a sample of your liquid into a bowl or dish. Add your acid with a dropper. If you see fizz forming in the bowl, your liquid is most likely a base.Choose a dilute acid such as vinegar. Do not use strong acids.;
, Add the base to a bowl and then add your liquid to the base with a dropper. If you see the fizzing and bubbling of a neutralization reaction, your liquid is most likely an acid. There is no need to use a strong base. Something like baking soda will work well., You can distinguish acids and bases by taste, but this should never be done with “mystery liquids.” If you know what liquid you are testing, then you can decide if it is safe to drink. Only drink liquids that are intended for human consumption, e.g, water, milk, orange juice.
 If you determine that your liquid is safe to drink, taste a sample. You can distinguish acids by their sour taste (lemons are high in citric acid). Bases can be identified by a bitter taste (mustard is basic).

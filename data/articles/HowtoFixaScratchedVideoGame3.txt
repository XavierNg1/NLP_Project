Make sure to choose a toothpaste that's actually an abrasive, one that feels gritty between your fingers or when it's in your mouth. A natural, chunkier toothpaste will work best.
 Don't rub the toothpaste in circles; it will only create more scratches that are harder for the console to read.
, If the scratch looks entirely polished away, try putting it into your console and playing it. If it still looks scratched, you may need to gently polish it several more times until the scratches are completely gone.


Over repeated polishing, the scratch will start to look like more of a shadow. When you're got it to this state, you're good.

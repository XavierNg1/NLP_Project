 The recipient of the forwarded message will be able to see the names and email addresses of anyone else who was involved in the original email thread – and depending on the situation, it might be most respectful to those people if you remove their emails from the forward.
 You don't need to change anything, depending on the context, but you might consider lightly editing the text or structure of the message that you're passing along. Take this opportunity to delete any parts of the forwarded message that you don't want your recipients to see. Once the email has been sent, you can't take it back! Look for the following things:


Carats (the bulky <<<>>> chains that can build up in a much-forwarded e-mail)
Mechanical errors: unnecessary extra lines/spaces; grammatical and spelling errors.
Attachments that are copies of the e-mail that you are forwarding. This is a waste of bandwidth and a golden opportunity for spammers/virus spreaders.
Banners that companies place at the bottom of your e-mails. These might read something like, "Free emoticons for your email!" or "make free pc to phone calls with ----"

, In a long email thread, there is information left over from the people who got the message before you: specifically, their names and email addresses. As the messages get forwarded along, the list of addresses grows and grows. All it takes is for some poor friend to get a virus, and his/her computer can send that virus to every email address that has come across his computer. Someone might even take all of those addresses and sell them or send junk mail – or even try to apply for a credit card in your name!

 There are a broad range of color and materials available for bondage play. From nylon to silk, you can have varying levels of comfort, security, etc., with the varying types of rope. If you are unsure what type you want or need, talk to your local sex-shop., Rope can be a dangerous tool in BDSM, as it can, if used improperly, cause nerve damage, asphyxiation, or even death. For instance, never press the rope against the front of your partner’s throat. Some things to consider when using rope play:When someone is bound, you should never leave them by themselves.
Avoid positions that make breathing difficult.
Make sure the ropes are comfortable and allow for circulation. There should be at least a finger’s-width of room between the rope and your partner’s skin.
 There are cuffs for the wrists, legs, and even genitalia. They are a quicker way of restraining your partner than rope and can be safer depending on the type. They come in a lot of varieties from soft-velcro to locking metal handcuffs. Again, check with your partner to determine what type to use., There are a few different types of gags out there, and you should talk to your partner about the best fit for them. A ball gag can create an intense sense of vulnerability as it can impede breathing somewhat and stretches the jaw in a way the body isn’t used to. A bit gag is friendlier on the jaw and breathing. With any gag you choose, you should establish a safe-gesture or signal, so your partner can let you know they feel unsafe.Don’t keep the gag on for longer than twenty minutes, especially if someone is new to gag play.
 A leash can be fun for the sense of control it offers to the dominatrix and the sense of being controlled it gives to the sub. In order to use a leash safely, don’t pull on it sharply. Make sure the collar is fitted properly, leaving two fingers’ width of room between the collar and the skin.

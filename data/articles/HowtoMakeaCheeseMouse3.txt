,, Cut small rounds of radish, carrot, zucchini or similar vegetables with round shapes. Insert two ears per wedge, adding the ears about a quarter of the way from the large end of the triangle (well away from the tip).
 Cut small triangle wedges from olives for the nose. Place on the very tip of each wedge.
 For the eyes, cut out slits of sundried tomatoes, roasted peppers, or similar. Place these a little below the ear area. Play around with the exact placement until the look seems most mouse like to you.
 It's now ready to serve.


An alternative way of serving is to place the mice directly onto cheese crackers for ease of picking up and eating. This can dispense with handling difficulties!

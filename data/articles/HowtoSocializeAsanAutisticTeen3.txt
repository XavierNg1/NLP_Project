 If your friend invites you to a party and you know it will be loud and smelly, you have the right to say "I'm busy that night" or "That's not really my scene." Choose gatherings where you can be happy.
 Know what constitutes the legal drinking age in your area, and remember that different people respond to alcohol differently. It's much safer to stay in control of your thoughts and actions.


If someone offers, simply say "I don't drink." Most people will leave it at that. If you face peer pressure, keep repeating "No thanks, I don't drink" until they give up.
Stay away from alcohol if you have a family history of alcoholism or mental illness. This has the potential to turn very dangerous for you, and make your life much harder.
 If it's loud or crowded, you may feel overwhelmed at times and need a brief break before you can comfortably re-engage.


Stepping outside for a breath of fresh air
Going to the bathroom and washing your face
Taking a break in a quieter room (within earshot for safety reasons)
Helping out in the kitchen
Going to the balcony for a one-on-one chat with a close friend

, This might take the form of going up to people you already know quite well and having a chat, or finding a comfortable place in the room where you feel part of the action but not at the centre. Find a comfortable retreat that you can return to if you get overwhelmed or need a little break.


You may feel more comfortable hanging out on the fringes.

 Sometimes, despite your best efforts at prevention, your dogs might get ticks. If your dogs seem lethargic, exhibit lameness, or have fevers, you should contact your vet and set up an appointment to check for ticks.Keep in mind that ticks also bite humans and that you can therefore exhibit signs that there are ticks on you, your dogs, or in your home. If you have a rash, joint pain, headaches, or a fever, get checked out by your doctor and have your dogs checked by your vet., If you only find one or two ticks on your dogs, you can remove them yourself, but you must use proper technique. Grip the tick as close to the skin as possible and with a quick flick remove the tick. Avoid squeezing the tick's body as this can cause the tick to vomit its stomach contents (with infectious agents) into your dog's bloodstream.Use a pair of fine nosed tweezers or a special tick hook removing device. Take care not to leave the mouthparts in the dog's skin as this can cause a tick granuloma, which may requires treatment.
Using other commonly suggested methods of removing ticks can also make the situation worse. Avoid using petroleum jelly to suffocate the ticks or fire to burn the ticks off.
 Unless your dogs only have one or two ticks, you shouldnâ€™t try to remove all of them yourself. Call your vet and ask for an appointment, but also find out what you can do to help your dogs in the meantime.

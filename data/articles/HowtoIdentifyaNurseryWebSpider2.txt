 Possibly the easiest way to identify a female nursery web spider is to watch for any spiders that are carrying an egg sac. A nursery web spider will carry her eggs in her fangs until they are nearly ready to hatch.The egg sac looks like a tiny white golf ball. It typically contains a few hundred eggs.The spider will carry the egg sac underneath her body., When it is almost time for the eggs to hatch, the female spider will spin a protective nursery web. This tangled web is usually spun in high weeds or low shrubs, with the egg sac itself suspended inside a leaf.After spinning the nursery web, the mother spider will stand guard over it until the eggs have hatched.The nursery web spider will shelter the young spiders until they are ready to fend for themselves.
 Nursery web spiders, unlike many other species, do not spin webs for hunting purposes. Instead, these spiders hide in wait for prey (typically insects) and then spring out quickly to catch it.Instead of entangling insects in a web, the nursery web spider simply overpowers and subdues its prey.These spiders hunt both by day and by night.
 A nursery web spider, while at rest, will often adopt an "X" shaped posture, holding its front and hind pairs of legs together.

 Weave oceanic colors like blue and green into your wardrobe. Maxi dresses and skirts flow in waves like the sea, as do some scarves. Gold jewelry is sometimes associated with mermaids––go for hammered gold or replicas of ancient coins, as if it were something you found on the sea floor.

When you go swimming, add a swim skirt or even a silicone mermaid tail to your swim suit.;
, You do not necessarily need starfish, or other used-to-be-alive animals, because some mermaids are against hurting aquatic animals. If you want to wear ocean animal-related accessories, replicas of dolphins, sea turtles, and tiny fish can be a cute touch.


Wear subtle sea related jewelry, including bracelets, bangles, necklaces, pendants, head bands, hair bands, wrist bands, rings, earrings, and anything else you think resembles the ocean.
Consider hats and scarves, with pops of sea colors.
 You can make your own mermaid tail or purchase one from a costume store.

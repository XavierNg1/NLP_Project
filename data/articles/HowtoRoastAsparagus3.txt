 Asparagus spears are done when the stalks are pliable, but not completely soft. Place the roasted asparagus spears on a serving platter.
 Sprinkle the roasted asparagus spears with finely grated Parmesan cheese or toss them with lemon juice if desired. Place lemon slices on top for presentation, if available.









Another tasty alternative is balsamic vinaigrette. If you haven't tried it, experiment. It gives it a subtly tangy flavor.
 The beauty of this veggie is that it's good cold, too! Save the leftovers for tomorrow and snack on 'em straight outta the fridge.









Store the asparagus in an airtight container. They'll keep for a day or two. Combine them with other recipes, too -- asparagus matches well with a number of flavors.

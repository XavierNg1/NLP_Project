 Fill a steaming wok or other steamer pan with 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of water. Set the pan on the stove over medium heat, and bring the water to a boil.


Before the water starts boiling, place an appropriately sized steaming rack over the top of the pan. The steaming rack should sit at least 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) above the surface of the water.
 Combine the egg whites and chicken broth in a heat-resistant ramekin. Add salt, if desired. Whisk or stir the ingredients together until evenly combined.


Use low-sodium chicken broth and omit the salt if you want the dish to be lower in sodium.
Note that the chicken broth could be replaced with vegetable broth, if desired.
 Place the ramekin on the center of the steaming rack. Cover the pan with its lid, then steam the egg whites for about 4 minutes, or until it is set and cooked throughout.To test for doneness, insert a toothpick through the center of the egg whites. The egg whites should be done once the toothpick comes out clean.
 Remove the ramekin from the heat. Immediately sprinkle the chopped tomato and feta cheese crumbles on top.


You can omit or change the toppings as desired, using up to 1/2 cup (125 ml) of any combination. For steamed egg whites, you could also consider using flaked tuna, flaked salmon, or other cooked and shredded/chopped seafood.
 Enjoy the steamed egg whites immediately and straight from the ramekin you cooked them in.

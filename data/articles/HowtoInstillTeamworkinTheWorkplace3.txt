 Managers and supervisors need to encourage their team members to bring up any problems, complaints or ideas. Welcome and encourage your staff to contact you in person or by email.
 Everyone is busy, but a weekly or monthly meeting to touch base will keep everyone on the same page and empowered to share progress, challenges and other important information with the entire team.
 There should be no side conversations, alliances or cliques when it comes to teamwork on a project. Make sure everyone knows to include the team on important messages and information.

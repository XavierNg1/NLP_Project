 If you have a smartphone, and you said, “I bet there’s an app for that.” You’re right. There is. Go to the app store for your device and type in, “fake a call.” You will find that some are created to play jokes and others are more serious. Check the functions and reviews to see which one works best for you. Be aware that some free apps may involve ads which could make faking calls in the heat of the moment a little problematic. Consider whether it is worth it to you to spend the money and purchase the app.


iPhones apps allow you to set everything from who is calling to the wallpaper on the screen in order to look entirely convincing.Androids have apps which allow you to initiate fake calls by shaking the phone, tapping the power button several times, or using the proximity sensor.;
, Learn about all of the features your app offers and make sure you understand all of the functions of your new app. If you downloaded a free version and feel that it is not adequate, upgrade and purchase the app. If you are having too much trouble using this one, you can always delete it from your phone and download a different one.
 You want to make sure that you are comfortable using your app before you find yourself in a situation where you need it. Try faking phone calls by yourself, then take it to the next level and attempt to fake a phone call in front of a friend. See if they can tell that the call was not real. If you don’t have the need to fake a call for a while, be sure to revisit the app on occasion for a little practice.
 Periodically, updates will be available for your app. You can check back with your store and see if you have an alert for an update. If you have set your phone to update automatically, this will be done for you. Be sure to review the changes any time updates occur and reeducate yourself with any new processes.

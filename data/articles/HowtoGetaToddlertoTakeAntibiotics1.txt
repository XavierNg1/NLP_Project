 This includes giving medicines that are taken once or twice a day as opposed to four times a day. There are different brands of antibiotics that act in a similar fashion, but some of them have to be taken more frequently than others.Talk to your doctor about the situation if your child won’t take her medication, and see if there is another pill that your child can switch to.;
, Some antibiotics will also taste better than others, though this will partly rely on your toddler’s preferences. However, if your child has already been started on an antibiotic course, she might not be able to switch., When medications are more concentrated, your child has to take less of the medication to get the same effect as a more diluted medication. When your child has to take less, you may find that she has an easier time swallowing the antibiotic.


For example, if your child was prescribed 200 mg of amoxicillin (which is the equivalent of a full teaspoon), your doctor could instead prescribe a higher dose of 400 mg amoxicillin (which is equivalent to half of a teaspoon)., To chase away the bad taste of the medicine, you can also give your child something tasty immediately after. Most antibiotics have a bitter flavor, so giving your child something sweet could help her to keep from vomiting after taking her medication.


One example could be giving your child a spoonful of chocolate syrup after taking her medication. In this situation, the old Mary Poppin’s saying “a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down”, really is true.
 You are generally not supposed to do this, but certain antibiotics may be able to be mixed with food. However, it is very important that your first talk to your doctor about doing this.


If your doctor gives the go-ahead, crush the tablet up, or open the capsule, and add the contents to applesauce or pudding.

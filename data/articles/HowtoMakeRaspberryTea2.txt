 In a large pot, bring the water to a boil., Stir all ingredients, allowing the sugar to melt and the raspberries to soften. Taste the tea as you stir. Remove the tea bags when your desired flavor has been reached. This is usually after three to five minutes.Black tea can become bitter if steeped for too long. Remove the tea bags before the tea becomes bitter., Use a strainer to pour the hot mix into a new container. The raspberry seeds and solids will sit in the strainer. Use a spoon to push the raspberry juice through the strainer. Use the spoon and strainer to avoid getting raspberry seeds in your tea mix., Put the tea in the refrigerator and let cool. Add ice to speed up the cooling process.


If your tea is weak, let it cool in the refrigerator without ice. If your tea is too strong, the ice will dilute the tea and soften the flavor.
 Pour the raspberry tea over ice-filled cups and enjoy.


Garnish with an orange slice, lemon slice, or mint leaf.

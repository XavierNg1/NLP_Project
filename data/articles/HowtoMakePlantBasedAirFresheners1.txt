, A ceramic or glass bowl would be ideal.
 For example, roses, freesias, violets or lavender. Wash the flowers if needed, or spray them with a little water to gently moisten.
 Let sit in this water to rest and infuse overnight.
 Transfer the flowers to it and cover with water. Let it settle by chilling in the fridge.
 Label so that you remember what's in it.

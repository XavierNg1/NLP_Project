Technically, it is illegal for telemarketers to call cell phones. However, this often happens anyway, so register either cell phones or landlines.;
, Once a month, telemarketers are required to clear numbers that have newly registered for the Do Not Call list. This means that after you register, you might still get some telemarketing calls before the end of the month.If you still receive telemarketing calls after a month, the telemarketers are in violation of the law. You can register a complaint against them with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
 The National Do Not Call Registry stops most telemarketing businesses, but it will not block all types of unexpected calls. Political organizations, charities, surveyors, and organizations that you have a relationship with may still be able to call you, by law. If you do not want these organizations to contact you, try other methods to block them., Some states have an additional, state-only do not call list. If yours offers one, registering with it can be an added layer of protection. Check with your state consumer protection agency to see if this option is available to you.

A list of contact details for each state’s consumer protection agency is available at https://www.usa.gov/state-consumer.

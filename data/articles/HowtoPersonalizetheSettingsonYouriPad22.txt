 This is usually turned on by default, but you can turn if off if desired.
 Tap the Settings icon, then the Notifications icon, then turn off Notifications. If Notifications are already turned off, then you can click the switch to turn them on.


You can also turn off Notifications for individual apps by choosing an app from the list in Notifications.

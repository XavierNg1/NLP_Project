 Finance charges can come to a good amount and maybe being aware of just how much you are paying to spend money you haven't got will slow you down. Some things you can look for are:


Programs that you aren't using and don't need
Annual credit card fees
Exorbitant interest rates;
, In most cases, 'convenience' equals higher costs. That one dollar bottle of vitamin water costs two or more at the convenience store.


In one month, buying 3 bottles of vitamin water a week can add up to a big difference:

3 (bottles a week) X 4 (4 weeks in a month) is $12.00 versus 18-24 dollars for the same type of drink.
 If you must smoke, find a local 'smoke shop' and pay cash. The cigarettes are usually cheaper there, however, many charge you for using debit or credit. This also applies for anything else that you purchase on a regular basis.




A chain store might charge you 7-8 dollars VS. a smoke shop of 5.00 dollars VS an outlet shop and 3.00 dollars. At a pack a day, this is $ 2555 VS $1825 VS 1095. (Results may vary).
 Do you really need everything you are paying for? Alternatively, can you put something into a plan instead of paying a higher charge?

, It is healthier and much cheaper.
 Find out exactly what you are paying for and if it is necessary. Shop around.
 If you have a magazine that you buy fairly regularly, it is much cheaper to subscribe to it.
 Pay the minimum or a little above the minimum and pay a lot towards a single bill. Do this until it is paid off. Then take that amount and apply it to the next largest bill.
 Instead of paying it once a month, pay it every two weeks. This will add up to an extra payment a year.

 (If that is a choice in your school) Students who don't cover their books take other precautions to care for their books. Some strategies:


Take good care of the covers - carry books carefully in your bag, making sure not to scrunch them, or to bend back covers when pushing them in.
Don't leave books sitting next to items that can cause stains, such as your lunch, ink, or markers with loose lids.
Leave books at home or at school/college where possible (this also helps to prevent back strain caused by carrying too many books)!
Carry your books by hand; use string or a strap to tie them into a neat bundle with a carry loop.
Make or purchase a durable book bag to carry books separately from other items. A book bag is also handy for slipping in between other items in a bag while still protecting your books.

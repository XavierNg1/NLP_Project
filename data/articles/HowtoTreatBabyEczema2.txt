Ask your doctor about appropriate dosing for your baby, as medication dosing depends on the age of the infant.
 You can purchase 1% hydrocortisone over-the-counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy.


Apply the medicine to the areas of the rash once or twice per day, or according to the directions on the bottle.
 If over-the-counter options are not enough, then your doctor may order prescription medications for your baby.Your doctor can offer higher strength immune suppressant medications, such as stronger topical corticosteroids or other creams, or rarely oral medications. Or, your doctor may recommend other options such as anti-inflammatory medications.


If your baby's rash becomes infected, he or she may also need topical or oral antibiotics to combat the infection.
Follow your doctor's suggestions, as he or she will know best exactly what your baby needs.
 However, it is sometimes used in very severe cases of eczema.
 Eczema is not a curable condition, but it is one that can be effectively managed by avoiding triggers and treating symptoms. Many people experience prolonged periods of remission of their eczema, and may go years without having any symptoms.


If your baby has eczema, the chances of it recurring later on are high, but some babies outgrow it.

 A political party includes both the party apparatus and the candidates running for office under the party’s name. If you want to donate in order to promote the party, consider where the donation would go the farthest. Typically, candidates for higher offices have a much easier time fundraising than candidates for smaller offices. One of the functions of the party organizations is to distribute money to the candidates for smaller offices who have a harder time fundraising. If races for national or higher profile offices are uncompetitive, consider making the donation to the party.
If you have supplies such as food, office supplies, or furniture, you can also donate those. Typically, a campaign will be in greater need of these items than a party.
 The easiest way to make a donation is to go to the website of the recipient, enter your credit or debit card information along with your name, address, occupation and employer, and donate your desired amount.Word to the wise: if an organization doesn’t have a way for you to donate on their website, it’s poorly managed. Donate to someone else.
 If you prefer to take things slowly, write out a check and mail it to the party or candidate. Make sure the check is filled out correctly and the envelope is addressed properly.Also include your name, address, occupation and employer.
 Finally, you can donate cash in person. Simply find a party or campaign office and tell them you’d like to make a donation. They’ll give you an envelope with spaces on the back to list your name, address, and employer. Fill out the back of the envelope, put the money in, and hand it over.

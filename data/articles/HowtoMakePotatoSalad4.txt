, Once they're done boiling, remove the potatoes from the hot water, drain them, and wait for them to cool.
 Peel the skin off the potatoes. It should slide off pretty easily. If you'd like to absorb the flavor of the skins in the salad, you can also just keep the skins on.
 Mix 4 tablespoon (59.1Â ml). mustard and 4 tbsp. soy sauce together in a small bowl. Combine the ingredients for a thicker mixture.
 Place 3 diced bell peppers, 10 diced 10 medium-sized button mushrooms, 100 g. (3 oz.) diced drained semi-dried boiled peanuts in oil, 3 diced slices of smoked turkey, 1 small tin of peas, 1/2 of a diced red onion, and 1/2 of a diced green onion together in a bowl. Toss them together to combine the ingredients.
 Now that they've cooled off a bit, you can chop them into manageable pieces.
 Toss the ingredients again to combine them.
 Mix the dressing with the potatoes and other ingredients until they're all combined and you've made a rich, creamy salad.
 This will allow the ingredients to blend.
 Serve this salad with glazed chicken, green beans, or any other side or side dish.

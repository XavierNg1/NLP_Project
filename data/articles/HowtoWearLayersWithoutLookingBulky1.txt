, One main color can keep your outfit looking neat. Competing colors may contribute to a bulky look. Not everything you wear has to be the exact same color, but go for a general color scheme.For example, wear a light blue blazer over a darker blue sweater.
You can also try something like a vibrant red vest over a lighter red shirt.
 Mix different types of prints and patterns. This can help your outfit stay stylish even when you have to layer. For example, try throwing polka-dot blazer over a blouse.Remember to keep one central color scheme in mind.
 You want to use fabrics for layering that are not too bulky. Instead of going for very heavy types of fabric, opt for a few layers of lightweight material.Things like chiffon, linen, and silk tend to be lighter weight.

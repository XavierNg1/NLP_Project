 The first step to getting a boy to kiss you is to be friendly and welcoming. If you are not already friends with him, introduce yourself and try to regularly communicate. This will create a closer relationship between you and him, and allow him to develop physical feelings for you.Try to keep conversation light and fun. You want to be a desirable person to spend time with so that he wants to get closer to you.
 Sometimes, when a boy wants to kiss you, he might be too uncertain of your feelings to make the move. Giving him hints that you want a kiss from him may be just what he needs to do it. Laugh at his jokes, ask him to spend time with you, and let him know you think he is cute.Here are a few things you can say:


"You are so funny. It is so fun spending time with you."
"I really like your shirt today. You look so good in it."

, Whenever you see him, or he tells you a joke, be sure to show him your best, "come hither" smile. Try grinning, and look at him flirtatiously at the same time. This will help to boost his confidence to kiss you., Show him you are interested by playfully touching his hand, shoulder, or face. When you touch him, it will signal to him that you want to get closer. When you greet or part ways, give him a long, tight hug., By giving him deep eye contact, and then looking at his lips, it will alert him that you may have kissing on your mind and are looking for a kiss from him. You don't have to look at his lips the whole time, but keep moving your eye contact from his eyes, down to his lips, and back up to his eyes when you talk.

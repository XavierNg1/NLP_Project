 Spread out your ingredients in newspaper-covered large pans such as a cookie sheet or table.Put the ingredients in place in a place that is dry and under direct sunlight such as in front of a window.


You will not need to dry the asafoetida.
If you are using fresh red chilli peppers or fresh coriander seeds, you will need to dry these ingredients in advance for about a week.
 Add a dash of cooking oil in your pan. Then fry the asafoetida for 2 to 3 minutes until it changes to a light yellowy colour. Remove the asafoetida from the pan.


It's important that you are using a whole piece of asafoetida when frying in oil and not the powder. If you are using an asafoetida powder, you can add it directly into the sun dried ingredients during grinding.
 Cooling down the ingredients prevents wet lumps from forming during grinding. A good wait time would be about 15 to 20 minutes for everything to completely cool down.
 Grind everything in a food processor. If you are making a large batch, you may need to grind everything in batches.


Alternatively, you can bring your ingredients to a grinder mill or grinding store where they will have large machines to grind the ingredients for you.

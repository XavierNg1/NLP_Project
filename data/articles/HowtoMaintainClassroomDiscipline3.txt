 No matter the age of your students, everyone should be treated with respect. Your students are more likely to treat you with respect as well.
 Show interest in your students by getting to know them. Make sure you know their names. Find out other information about them by asking questions.


Keep in mind, however, that you shouldn’t become the student’s close friend. It’s important to maintain a level of distance in order to preserve your authority in the classroom. Otherwise, a student may seek special treatment or favors, especially when dealing with a discipline issue., When your students are engaged in the class material, they will take more responsibility in the conduct of the class. Plan out interesting and engaging lessons and incorporate fun activities to keep up their involvement.For example, take simple polls in the class to determine how students feel about a particular issue.
 Even though these students are teenagers, they may still need to work on their social-emotional skills. Help students problem-solve their issues with friends and classmates.For example, if a student misbehaves or upsets another student, help this student come up with his own method of reparations that will be a meaningful solution.
 Treat your students equally. Although you might have favorite students, don’t show this to your students. Apply discipline evenly across the board.
 Treat every day as a new opportunity for success in your classroom. Don’t assume the worst of your students.
 Keep moving throughout the classroom when you’re teaching and when students are doing group or individual work. Students notice that you’re engaged with their progress. Give hints to students as they work on problems., , If you need to talk with a student about discipline, don’t do so in a way that humiliates the student. Take the student aside or talk to him outside the classroom. Don’t use the instance as a moment to embarrass the student in front of his peers.

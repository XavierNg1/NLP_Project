 There is no cure for psoriasis, so most treatments focus on removing the scaly layer of your skin so it is smooth and not irritated. The treatment may also prevent skin cells from growing too quickly, which can reduce inflammation and the formation of lesions. Your doctor may suggest topical treatments in the form of a cream or ointment as a first step to address your psoriasis, especially if it is mild.Your doctor may suggest topical corticosteroids that you apply as a cream or ointment to your affected skin. Your doctor may also suggest a medicated cream that contains vitamin D analogues.
 If your psoriasis is more severe or it does not go away with topical treatments, you doctor may suggest the use of light therapy or phototherapy. During light therapy, your skin is exposed to natural or artificial ultraviolet light in controlled doses.Your doctor may refer you to a dermatologist, who will perform light therapy on your skin in their office. Depending on the severity of your psoriasis, you may need to do about 20 light therapy sessions before you see improvements on your skin.
You can also try lying out in the sun as a form of light therapy. You may do multiple sunbathing sessions throughout the week to help treat your psoriasis. Make sure you wear SPF 15 and over on areas of your body that do not have psoriasis and avoid getting sunburnt, as sun burns can make psoriasis worse., Your doctor may suggest oral medications or injected drugs if your psoriasis is very severe or resistant to other types of treatment. There are severe side effects for these medications so your doctor may only recommend that you use them for brief periods of time.Your doctor may prescribe oral drugs like retinoids or methotrexate. Your doctor may also suggest the use of injected drugs, which will help to treat psoriasis on your entire body.

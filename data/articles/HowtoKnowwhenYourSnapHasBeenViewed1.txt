You can also access this page by swiping right on the camera screen.
 An empty arrow means the snap has been opened, but not viewed. A filled square means you have a pending snap to to view.
The color of the icon also matters. A red icon means the snap does not contain audio, while a purple icon means the snap does have audio included.
Color coded icons also apply for chats. A blue chat bubble means your chat has been viewed. A grey chat bubble means the chat is either pending or expired.



Keep in mind, like the snaps themselves they will be deleted from the server after viewing, once you leave the expanded chat screen.

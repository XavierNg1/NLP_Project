If privacy is an issue, your treatments will need to address that. Consider what part of the interior space your window is in, as well as what portion of the outside environment it opens up to. For example, a bathroom window that opens out to a front driveway will need much more privacy than a library window that opens out to a garden.
Window coverings may be used to diffuse light, or block light out altogether. Consider how the sun rises and sets in relation to the room the window is in, and decide if it is necessary to manage that light using window treatments.
Window dressings can be used for decorative purposes, to frame a window, draw attention to the window's architectural details, accent an interior design and/or camouflage an oddly shaped or placed window.
It is possible to create interior design optical illusions by strategically choosing and installing window furnishings that lend to a desired effect. For example, you can make a ceiling appear higher by hanging vertical, floor to ceiling drapes.
Thick window coverings can be used to protect your interior space from the elements and regulate room temperature.
 Choose treatments that fit into your budget, compliment your d√©cor and fulfill your intended purpose(s).

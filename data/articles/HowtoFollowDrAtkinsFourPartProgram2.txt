 Atkins recommends you start with 25 grams of net carbohydrates each day and slowly increase the gram count. If weight loss stalls or slows down drastically, you may have reached your "Carbohydrate Level for Losing" or CLL. In order to jump start your weight loss again, adjust your net carbohydrate level by lowering it 10 grams.
 These foods have higher net carbohydrates per serving and can be added to the list of allowed foods used during Phase 1.

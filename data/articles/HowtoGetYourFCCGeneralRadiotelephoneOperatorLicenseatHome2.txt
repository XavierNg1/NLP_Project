 The FCC offers everything you need to prepare for the exam. The FCC uses only the questions present in the question pools on its exams.


On the Examinations page of the FCC Website, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on "Examination Questions Pool."
Download the materials for Element 1 and Element 3. (Include Element 8 if you've decided to pursue the radar endorsement as well.)

, If possible, have someone quiz you verbally on the questions.

It is not recommended that you look for additional outside information for studying purposes. Only questions given as examples in the Question Pool will be used on the exam.
 While the FCC administers and awards the PG licenses, it does not administer the exams required to obtain them. Rather, the FCC authorizes several Commercial Operator License Examination Managers (COLEMs) to conduct the exams nationwide.The FCC offers a list of authorized COLEMS on its Website, along with their respective fees. To access this, go to the Examinations page and select "Testing Managers, Locations, Schedules, and Fees."Once you have decided which COLEM you will use for your exam, contact them to check when the next scheduled exam is and how to register.
Many COLEMs offer online testing, in addition to in person exams. This may be beneficial to you if there are no testing facilities in your area.In some cases, if you pass the exam, the COLEM will electronically file your application for you. Otherwise, they will give you a Proof of Passing Certificate (PPC) that needs to be included with your license application.

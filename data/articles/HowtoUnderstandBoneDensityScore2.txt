 T-scores are typically reported in terms of standard deviations from the mean bone density score for young, healthy adults of your gender. The number indicates how close or how far your bone density measure is from the average.


If your T-score is -1, 0, or a positive number, your bone density is considered normal and healthy.
If your T-score is between -1 and -2.5, your score indicates that you may be at risk of osteoporosis. Your bone density is lower than average and you may have osteopenia, which can lead to osteoporosis.
If your T-score is below -2.5, you likely have osteoporosis. Your bones are likely weak, brittle, and prone to breaks from falls or even from some regular activities.
 This score gives a reading of your bone density in comparison with other individuals of your weight, sex, racial or ethnic background, and age.


If your Z-score is -1, 0, or a positive number, your bone density is comparable to that of other people of your demographic characteristics.
If your Z-score is -2 or below, your bone density is worse than average for people of your demographic characteristics. This result points to the possibility that there may be a cause of your bone loss other than aging; you may need additional testing and treatment to delay or prevent additional loss of bone density.

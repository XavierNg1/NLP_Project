 Painting buffalo check requires three different colors. For best results, choose colors that complement each other well. For instance, you might choose white, gray, and navy.A common combination is a base color of white and then two different hues of a given color. For instance, you might choose white, bright red, and dark red., You can best paint your wall using a roller brush and a bucket of paint. Lay down some cardboard and newspaper before you get started to catch dripping paint., If the wall or object you wish to paint with a buffalo check pattern does not already include one of the colors you want to include on your buffalo check wall, you’ll need to paint it to include one of these colors. Clean the wall with a damp cloth, then allow it to dry.When you’re ready, pour the paint into a tin paint pan. Roll the brush in the paint. Slowly roll the brush across the wall in “W” shapes of varying sizes to get the entire wall the right color.
 When your wall is dry, cut a piece of cardboard stock to the exact dimensions you wish each square in your buffalo check pattern to be. Starting at the top left corner of the wall, use a pencil to lightly trace the bottom edge of the square. When you’re finished, slide the square down so that its top edge directly abuts the bottom edge of the square above. Continue working your way down the column.There’s no need to trace the entire square. Just run your pencil along the bottom edge at regular intervals, keeping the left edge against the corner of the room.
For best results, your squares should be about seven to 12 inches on each side.

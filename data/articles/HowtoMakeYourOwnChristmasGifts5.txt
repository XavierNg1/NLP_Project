 Buy an inexpensive picture frame and personalize it for the recipient.



Use dimensional fabric paint to create your own unique designs.
Gather together or buy plastic BarbieÂ® doll accessories, beads, jigsaw puzzle pieces, and other knick-knacks that symbolize the interests of the recipient. For example, for a sports enthusiast, you could use plastic Barbie doll tennis shoes, plastic toy baseballs and/or popcorn from a doll house set. Find a jigsaw puzzle with pictures of footballs or soccer on it and use those pieces or get some sports-themed scrapbooking or card-making accessories from the craft store.
Use hot glue and/or glue dots to glue the items on the frame. You can leave it as is or use some spray paint to color the whole thing, items and all in silver, gold or another color.
Put a special poem or message in the frame and you've got a show-stopping gift without an extravagant price tag.
 Stick it in the center of a piece of cardboard using a glue gun or a glue stick. Collect picture of things the receiver likes. Make a collage of the pictures around the person's picture. This inexpensive gift is very nice for people of all ages.
 They can be sweet to give, and reminds them of you!

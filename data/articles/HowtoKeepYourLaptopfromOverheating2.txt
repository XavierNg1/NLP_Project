 There are many brands to choose from (Thermaltake, Xion, Targus) and are available at computer stores like Best Buy or online from Newegg. You can even buy risers, or computer stands, that have ventilation.


If you can't afford/find cooling mat, always prefer something hard under the laptop rather than something soft. For example, use a plastic casing, a lap desk, tray table or even a wooden cutting board to provide a solid, flat surface to allow proper airflow.
Don't use your laptop on soft surfaces such as a sofa, carpeting, folded quilt or pillow. Any vents located on the bottom of your laptop will be blocked and airflow will be reduced, causing it to overheat. It may even overheat enough to catch on fire.
, Use a steel flat bar as an external heat sink. It works because your computer has to heat up more mass before it overheats. This also means, that the larger the bar, the longer it will take for it to overheat. It will only work if your laptop has a metal case, and it feels hot.

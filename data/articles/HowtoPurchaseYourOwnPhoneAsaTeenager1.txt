 Offer to do some serious cleaning that could take the burden off your parents...for a fee. Charge a small sum of money for each chore, depending on the type of chore. The more undesirable, the more you should ask for. Set a maximum asking price depending on how well set off your family is.


You could offer to clean the bathroom, shovel snow, rake leaves, water the garden, make the beds, do the dishes, wash the car, clean your room, or organize shelves/cabinets.;
, Get a job! You can go and get an actual part-time job at a small establishment or work around the neighborhood. If you work around the neighborhood, you can charge more than you would for your parents. Once again, charge by the chore and the undesirability.


You can offer to tend or water a garden, clean their pool, clean the patio, rake the leaves, or shovel snow.
 You probably get money from your siblings, family, and extended family for your birthday, allowance, and holidays you celebrate. Keep a jar or piggy bank for the money you collect. Store some cash for yourself as well. You could keep sticky notes that remind you how much you need, your current balance, and what you're saving for.


Save up some extra for your first payment(s) on your future phone.

 In order to import Pokémon from a previous generation, you're going to need to have a GameBoy Advance game. The six games you can use to import Generation III Pokémon are Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, or LeafGreen.

You can't use a GamePak from previous generations. If you want to transfer a Pokémon from Generation I (Red, Blue, and Yellow) or Generation II (Gold, Silver, and Crystal) to your DS, you'll have to find a different way of transferring the Pokémon.;
, Take your DS, DSi or DS Lite and put the GamePak into Slot 2. If you're unsure where Slot 2 is, it's located in the center of the bottom of the DS where the volume control and the headset jack are located. It will be covered by the DS's cartridge; pull it out and insert your GamePak into the GameBoy Advance slot., Don't start up Generation V games such as Black or White; it's not possible to directly import Generation III Pokémon from a GamePak into Generation V. However, once you've transferred the Pokémon you want into Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver, you can then trade them to a game such as Black or White., Once you have loaded the DS game's main menu, there should be a new option labeled "Migrate Pokémon From...". Select this option., Once the screen pops up, you will be able to pick six Pokémon from your Generation III CP Box that you want to transfer to your Generation IV game. These Pokémon can't know HMs, or else you won't be able to migrate them.

You have to migrate six Pokémon at a time, so if necessary, catch "filler" Pokémon in your GamePak game and place them in your Box to transfer along with the Pokémon you want to use or trade in your DS game. The "fillers" can be low-leveled Pokémon like Poochyena, Wurmple, or anything else easy to catch; they can be kept or released when transferred to your DS game.
Be careful which Pokémon you select to migrate! Once you've migrated a Pokémon from your GamePak to your DS game, you won't be able to send it back. Avoid sending away your entire Generation III team unless you're planning on restarting your game or have suitable replacements for your team.
 After transferring your GamePak Pokémon to your DS game, load your DS game and travel to Pal Park., Once you've reached Pal Park, participate in the Catching Show to catch your Generation III Pokémon in Pal Park. The location of your migrated Pokémon will be dependent on its type; Water types will be located in water, for example., Once you've begun a Catching Show, go through Pal Park and catch the Pokémon you migrated from your Generation III game! Well done!

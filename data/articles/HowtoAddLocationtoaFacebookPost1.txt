, Either on your Timeline or Home page, write a new status message on the box that says “What’s on your mind?”

, Once you finish writing a status but before posting, look just right below your status in the same “What’s on your mind?” box. You will see four gray icons alongside the blue “Post” button. Click on the second icon from the left, the one that looks like a GPS marker.
 Clicking on the location icon opens up a list of known places around you. You can either click on one of those places, or start typing your location and it will usually pop up even before you’re done typing. Click on it to add it to your status.
 Check your status for errors and give it a once-over before you hit Post. Doing so will save you from tagging yourself in the wrong place and going through the trouble of having to edit your post.

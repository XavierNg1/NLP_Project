 Seal the bag so that no water can escape. Use easy-to-seal Ziploc bags for convenience. Otherwise, tie the opening of each bag shut.;
, Wedge each bag deep into the toe box of the shoe. If you want to stretch another part of the heel, then try to arrange the bag such that the water will expand at the desired point.Be aware that this technique works best on leather/suede shoes. It also usually works on fake leather. However, false leather tends to shrink back to its original size rather quickly, so you'll have to repeat this a couple of times for the full effect.
 Place the heels in the freezer, bags of water and all. Leave them to cool overnight. If you need to stretch the heels more quickly, then make sure to wait at least until the water has completely frozen within the bags., Once the water has frozen overnight, remove the shoes from the freezer. Leave the ice packs to thaw for 20-25 minutes: until the ice melts to water. Remove the bags from the shoes.
 Wipe off any water that the melting ice bags have left on your heels. Then, try to wear the heels. Check whether they've stretched enough. If the shoes still don't fit, then feel free to freeze again or try another method.

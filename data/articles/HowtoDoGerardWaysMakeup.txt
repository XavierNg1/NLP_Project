 (Check the Things You'll Need section below);
, This will be your foundation. You want to get a "dead" look.
 You want to get it nice and dark. Thickness depends on how dramatic you want to look.


, Choose a dark shade of red, purple, or, for those who would like, a dark brown.
 Start under your eye, as to make it look like you haven't slept in 7 days. Use your finger to smudge the eyeshadow around, to blend it in. You don't want to overdo it, as for you will look like a druggie! Next, apply to the top. This should only go up to the eyebrow, not any higher. Smudge and blend in as desired.
 If you choose, you can add some color to your lips. A pale pink, or, if you would like, a dark red. If you do not want to add any color, your white makeup should cover your lips. (Only the parts where you would apply lip balm or lipstick.)

, Add a strip of tape to your forehead,(put on as straight as possible.), and then one on your nose. This part takes 3 pieces of tape, apply 1 piece to the bridge of the nose, 1 on the left and 1 on the right. Try to make as straight as possible. These pieces will end up making a bar in the middle,(where your eyes are.), and then apply red or black face paint in the middle. Once done, remove the tape, there should now be a bar of red or black over your eyes.(See video, a lesson by Gerard Way himself!)

, Gerard's hairstyles: Short white hair, short blond hair, short black hair, long black hair, long red hair. Keep in mind that Gerard also likes to add bits of color in his hair. He adds in stripes of red, lavender, and even green.
 (Optional) A black, dark red, or purple nail polish works fine. Just do your makeup first!

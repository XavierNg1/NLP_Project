 Start by reversing the flow of the filter to flush away any gunk that has collected. How you do it depends on the type of filter, but generally, you use a syringe or hose that comes with your water filter to reverse the flow by pressing water through it backwards.If you're using your filter often, all you need to do is reverse the flow. If your filter has been dry for a while, you need to moisten it by letting water go through it in the normal direction before reversing it.
 Some filters can be brushed to remove the gunk instead of reversing the flow. However, your filter must be designed for brushing, so always check the manual first. To brush it, simply use a soft-bristled brush to gently remove any gunk and build up on the filter., Tap water that has chlorine (as many cities add chlorine to the water) can help clear out bacteria in the filter. Run a gallon or so of water through the filter the normal way to help clear off the bacteria.If your tap water isn't chlorinated, add 8 drops of clear liquid bleach (unscented) to a gallon (about 2 liters) of water. Stir it up, and then let it sit for half an hour before using.If you want to be sure your filter is disinfected, you can make the bleach solution a little stronger, with about a capful of bleach in a quart (about a liter) of water.
 If you're planning on storing your water filter, you need to dry it thoroughly. You can let it air dry in a warm, ventilated area. Just don't put it directly in sunlight.

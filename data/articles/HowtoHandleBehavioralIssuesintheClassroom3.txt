 This will help students predict their day. Try to keep each day similar to the next.


For example, math always happens at 1:00, after recess.
At the beginning of each day, read the schedule aloud. Hang it where students can easily look at it for reference.
 Handling transitions can be difficult for some special needs students, and giving extra time to prepare can help.


Consider getting a light-up timer to demonstrate how much time is left.
Praise them when they handle it well.
 Inconsistent behavior on your part will lead to confusion and anxiety among students.


Don't let a "better-behaved" student get away with doing something that a "worse-behaved" student isn't allowed to do. This is unfair, and they won't understand how rules work.
Some students may try to test limits. Make it clear that the consequences will be the same each time.
 These include "Be respectful of everyone," "Keep your hands to yourself," and "Don't talk while the teacher talks." This can help the students remember the rules, and you can point out the poster if a child is refusing to follow a rule.

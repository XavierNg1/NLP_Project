Click on the selected group name link to browse its home page.
 To make an existing group “Closed,” you must access to the Group Settings page. You can reach at the Group Settings page of a group either from the Your Groups page or from the group’s home page.

To go to the Group Settings page from the group home page, click on “Menu” button at the bottom right corner of the group cover image and select the “Edit group settings” tab in drop-down menu.
 On Group Settings page, click on the “Closed” radio button under “Privacy.”


When you are done, click on the “Save” button at the bottom of the page to make this group “Closed.” The setting will be updated with a notification “Your changes have been saved” at the top of the page.

 If you want to get to know the girl outside of school, a good way to talk to them is through social media. Add her on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, or Tumblr. When you have her username, you can direct message her.


You can ask by saying, "Have you tried the new Snapchat filter? Do you have an account? What's your username?"
Ask her how her day is going before asking her about her username.
 You can text each other if you both have a cell phone. If one of you doesn't have a cellphone, you can talk over a land-line. When you ask for her number, don't make it a big deal about it. Ask as if you were asking her any other question.


Ask her for her phone number by saying, "Hey, I'd like to talk to you outside of school. Can I have your phone number?"
Ask her what the best time to call would be.
 Once you start talking to her regularly, be sure to listen more than you talk. Ask her questions if the conversation stalls and see what she has to say about herself. If you haven't heard of something she talks about, then do research online to learn about it.


You can ask her questions like "What kind of movies do you like," "What kind of music do you like," or "Are you into sports?"

, If you're a funny guy, then try to make her laugh whenever you can. Boys who can make girls laugh are viewed as friendly, fun and popular.If you aren't funny, that's okay too. If this is the case, be nice during the conversation and stay away from picking on her or making fun of her.


The happier she is while talking to you, the more she'll want to date you.

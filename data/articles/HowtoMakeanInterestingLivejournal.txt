 You can make a fan based page on your favorite TV star, an informational page on your favorite sport, there are really endless possibilities!;
, For example, if your theme is figure skating, a picture of a girl doing a basketball move won't do at all! Instead, Google "Figure Skating" for a wide range of photos to use.
 Let's say your theme is swimming. Don't start by saying "I love swimming because..." That's boring! Instead, say "Who are the girls and guys who zoom through the water? Spend countless hours in pools? The swimmers!" And then go into your paragraphs on your LiveJournal.
 An interesting journal would be one that is updated 4-5 times a week. If this is not possible, so be it, but your visitors won't appreciate the same thing over and over.

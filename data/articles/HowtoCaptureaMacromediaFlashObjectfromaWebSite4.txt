 Certain websites such as Hulu use the RTMP protocol to stream their videos. These videos are Flash objects, but cannot be accessed the same way that a normally-embedded Flash object can. If you are trying to save a flash movie but cannot find the actual SWF file for the video, you are probably trying to access an RTMP stream.
 There are a few programs that specialize in capturing the streams for RTMP files. Some of the more popular programs include:


Replay Media Capture
StreamTransport

, Most of these programs will attempt to install browser plugins and toolbars that can slow down your web browsing experience. Make sure to disable and decline any extra installations during the program’s setup.


These programs are notoriously finicky and there is a chance that they will not work with your particular system setup or with the specific video you are trying to capture., RTMP capture programs must be running before you load the video. They will automatically begin capturing the playback when the video starts.
 After a moment, the stream should appear in your RTMP capturing program. You will need to play the entire video in the browser in order for the whole thing to be captured.
 Once you are done streaming, select the appropriate file in your RTMP capture program and save it wherever you’d like on your computer. There will likely be several options to pick from in the capture program, due to ads that are often played with videos. Inspect the file details to see the length, which will help you determine which of the files is the correct one.
 You may need to use a specialized video player to watch the videos after saving them. VLC player and Media Player Classic are two of the most popular free options available.

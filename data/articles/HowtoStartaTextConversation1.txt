 If you recently spent time with the person, you can always make the initial text about the last thing that you did together. Using an event as a reference point allows them to give you their opinion and is a casual way to start a conversation.For instance, you can say something like, "Whoa, I'm so full. That restaurant was so good!"
Or you could say, "Wow, Ms. Thornberry's class was so boring today. I was falling asleep.";
, Asking a question as your initial text puts the ball in their court and they can either respond or ignore you. If they respond with another question, make sure to follow up with them.Your question can be something as simple as "What are your plans for the weekend?" or "What kind of shoes were you wearing today? I want to pick up the same pair."

, Adding humor to an initial text is a great way to get the ball rolling. Avoid mundane openings like "Hi" or "What's up?" as your first text. If you text them something that they aren't used to seeing, there's a better chance of them texting you back.


You could say something like, "So, I just walked 20 blocks for a sandwich only to realize that today's Sunday and the store is closed. How's your day going?"

, While a bit of mystery can build interest, you don't want to withhold your identity for too long or else it can come off as creepy. When you have a person's number, but they don't have yours, it's always good to let yourself be known.


Start the text with a question like "Guess who this is?" followed by your name, or "Hey you, It's Garrett. I got your number from Kelly."

, The only way you can start a conversation over text is by going for it. If you have their contact information but are too nervous or scared to reach out, you'll never be able to have a conversation with them. Don't wait too long and build up the event in your head. The worst that can happen is that they don't text you back, which is the same result you'd achieve by not texting them at all.

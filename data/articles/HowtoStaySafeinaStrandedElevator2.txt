 Do not try to pry open the doors or climb out of the elevator. This will likely lead to injury and put you in danger. Instead, stay seated on the floor of the elevator. Standing up in the elevator can lead to feelings of anxiety and vertigo.Try to get comfortable on the floor. Use jackets or bags to prop yourself up. Hold onto your bag or your coat if that helps you stay calm.
 To help you stay calm in the elevator, do deep breathing exercises. Find a comfortable seated position. Then, inhale for four counts through your nose, hold it, and then exhale for four counts through your mouth. Do this several times until you feel calm and relaxed.You can try closing your eyes to help you stay calm as you deep breath.
If you have access to music, such as on your cell phone, you may listen to music as you do deep breathing to stay calm.
 Though you may feel anxious in a stranded elevator, try to sit tight and wait for help to arrive. Getting upset will only lead to more tension in the elevator and make you more nervous. Be assured that once help is called, people are often rescued from stranded elevators within an hour.To help ease your anxiety, you may try calling the help personnel on your cell phone or through the help button in the elevator to keep them updated on the situation. Ask them for reassurance that help is on its way so you can stay calm.

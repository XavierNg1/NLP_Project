 Make sure there is no plastic or foil covering the cork. It should be just the cork and the bottle. To remove the cover, simply slide it off by pulling it upwards. If it doesn’t slide off, pull on the tab if it has one, which will remove the top portion of it. Alternately, cut it off with a knife by gently tracing a knife around the edge of it., It can be any kind of flat shoe (not high heels or flip flops), as long as its opening is large enough to accommodate a bottle of wine. The bottle should go in bottom first, so that the cork is facing you. To keep the bottle in the shoe, you will hold the bottle with one hand and the shoe with your other hand., Continuing to hold both the shoe and the bottle, hit the bottom of your shoe against a wall several times. The bottle should be horizontal and you only need to make contact on the wall with the portion of your shoe directly under your bottle. Your shoe will protect the bottle from breaking, but don’t hit it too hard. A firm hit several times should begin to move the cork out due to the pressure in the bottle.








If you are on a picnic and there isn’t a wall nearby, you could hit your shoe against a pole or a tree. Just make sure not to miss it or you will likely drop your bottle!
If you don’t have a shoe that fits a wine bottle, you could wrap the bottle in a towel or hold a book behind the bottle while hitting it. The shoe’s purpose is simply to protect the bottle from breaking.
 Once the cork has moved out of the bottle by about an inch, you can simply pull out the cork with your fingers. Your bottle of wine is now ready to enjoy.

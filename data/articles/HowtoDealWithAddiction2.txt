 Take away one cigarette from that pack each day and throw it away. So one day you smoke 20, and the next 19, and so on. Once you get down to half the amount of smoking, or whatever it is, than you had before, you're ready for the next step.;
, Alright, so keep doing half those cigarettes as you had before, or that one glass of wine a day as opposed to two. And get a family member or close friend to make sure you don't cheat and do more. Because after all, you're only cheating yourself. But you may still need some help. Get them to encourage you!

, Many people do this for cursing. Every time you smoke one more than you should (or cheat) you have to put a quarter or a dollar in the coin jar. When it fills up (which it shouldn't) donate the money to charity and start again. No one likes to lose money, right? So it'll break that habit.
 Just one cigarette wouldn't hurt, right? Wrong. You know you want it, but you shouldn't have it. No, it's not right to cheat at any time. Be strict with yourself. Just stop buying it,and make sure that person is still helping you.
 Make a list of all the reasons why you shouldn't do or eat that addiction, and post it by your bedside, or in your wallet, or just somewhere you'd see it daily. That'll remind you.
 Or down, as the case may be. Smoke (or curse or drink or Tweet or whatever) less and less each day. Set yourself a goal every week. If you can't reach it, put more money in that jar. Have friends and family encourage you. Look at that list. You can do it!

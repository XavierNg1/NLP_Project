 Paraphrasing is just putting something in your own words. When you are writing a research paper, you will paraphrase research the majority of the time.


The only time you want to use a quote is when something is said in a unique way. If the original author said, “Veggies are green,” that isn’t a particularly unique way of saying it; you can easily rewrite it.
However, if the author said, “The vegetation is such a succulent green that the sunlight dances off of its leaves,” that is a more unique way of saying it; in that case, you may want to quote the author by placing quotations around the phrase and using the text word-for-word.
 When you paraphrase, use a thesaurus to help you pick out new words if you can’t think of ones on your own.


Just make sure that the word you choose has the same connotation as the original.
Connotation is the feeling or emotional punch a word has, beyond the dictionary definition.
 Paraphrasing isn’t just changing the words, it also means changing the structure.


Therefore, you can’t just take a phrase like “The cat likes to lick ice cream” and replace it with “The feline loves to lap ice cream.”
Rather, you need to structurally change it: “Because the cat enjoys ice cream, he was lapping it up.”

 Take every single CD of of that cluttered CD rack!;
, Do you want them categorized by genre? Or how about most used? Genre is easier, and i recommend that way.
, Take a look at pile number one. Take the CDs in that pile, and divide them into rock, country, hip hop, classical, pop, religious, or whatever categories fit your needs.
 Complete step 4 for the remaining piles.
, Now that all your CDs are categorized, it is time to re-shelve. Start with one pile, such as country music, then put those CDs in the first area of your CD rack. Continue doing this till all the CDs are on your CD rack

, Congratulations! You have just categorized your CDs!

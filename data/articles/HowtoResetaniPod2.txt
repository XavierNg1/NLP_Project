 If you can't reset your iPod no matter what you do, you may need to restore it. Restoring your iPod will erase all of the data, but you can load an old backup so that you don't have to start over from scratch.
 If your device does not appear in iTunes, even though it is plugged in, you may need to enable Recovery Mode. You will need to unplug your iPod from your computer to enter Recovery Mode. See this guide for detailed instructions. If your iPod is recognized by iTunes, continue to the next step.
 Select your iPod and find the "Back Up Now" button in the Backups section. This will allow you to back up your settings, apps, and pictures to your computer before you restore your iPod. If your iPod is not functioning, you may not be able to make a new backup before restoring.


Make sure to back up to your computer instead of iCloud, as an iCloud backup doesn't save everything.
 With a backup safely made, you're ready to restore your iPod. Click the "Restore iPod" button to begin the restore process. You will be asked to confirm that you want to restore.


The restore process can range from several minutes to an hour, so make sure that you have enough time to wait for it to finish.
 After the restore process is complete, you can start using your iPod as if it was new, or you can load an old backup file. This will restore all of your settings and apps. You can load an old backup after the restore process is complete and the "Welcome to your New iPod" window appears. Select "Restore from this backup", ensure that the correct backup has been selected, and click Continue.

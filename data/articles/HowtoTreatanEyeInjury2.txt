 Do this as soon after the injury as possible. Hold the compress against the eye with gentle pressure. The compress should be cold, which will help reduce swelling if applied very soon after the injury.The compress can be made of a cold pack or a cloth filled with ice.
Put pressure near and around the eye, but not on the eyeball itself.
Leave the compress on until it’s no longer cold. Repeat this several times a day for a few days.
 If the colored or white part of the eye has blood in it, the person should see an eye specialist immediately. This should happen even if the person isn’t in severe pain. Blood in the eye could lead to or be a sign of serious complications. The person should also seek immediate medical care if they have:Vision problems (such as double vision or blurry vision)
Severe pain
Bruising around both eyes
Bleeding from the nose

, After the swelling has stabilized (usually after a couple of days), heat will be more effective than ice. Create a compress with a hot water bottle, a heating pad, or a washcloth soaked in hot water.A heat compress should be warm to hot; however, don’t make it so hot that it is uncomfortable or will burn you.
Keep the compress on for as long as you like. A minimum of 10 minutes is good, but you can feel free to leave it on much longer than that.
Repeat this several times a day until the injury is healed.

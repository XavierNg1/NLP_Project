 Vinyl seats are the easiest type of seats to clean, since spills and messes usually just wipe off. Spray an all-purpose glass cleaner on the seats and wipe them down with a soft cloth.Work on one seat area at a time so that the glass cleaner doesn’t run down and drip onto the floor.
 You can also use a mixture of baking soda and water to clean and polish vinyl seats. Make a paste of the two ingredients and rub it over the upholstery, one seat at a time. To finish the job, rinse the seats off with a mild soap and water mixture. Wipe the seats dry with a clean, soft cloth.


Oil-based cleaners will harden your vinyl seats, so you should refrain from using these types., On the seat upholstery, there are seams where the upholstery has been sewn together. Dirt and debris can easily gather here and it is often hard to lift this dirt with a vacuum or cloth. Use a toothbrush to get at these areas, scrubbing gently with your cleaner.
 Remove the floor mats from the car and clean them using the same cleaner that you’ve used on the rest of the upholstery. To clean the mats, make an all-purpose upholstery cleaner by mixing 1 part water with 1 part dishwashing liquid. Spray the mixture onto the mat and brush with a soft-bristled brush. Rinse thoroughly with warm water and use a microfiber cloth to dry the mats.


For rubber or vinyl mats, you can also apply liquid wax shoe polish to them. This will help improve their shine and will also make them easier to rinse off and keep clean.

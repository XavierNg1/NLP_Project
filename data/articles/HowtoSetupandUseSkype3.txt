 You can purchase a Skype phone number for $5 per month. This will allow anyone to call you from any phone. This is especially useful if you are traveling in another country or are moving to a new area.


You can choose the area and country code when you set up your Skype number.
The Skype number acts just like any telephone number.
The caller will receive charges based on standard rates. For example, if the caller lives in New York, and your Skype number is in London, the caller will be charged standard international rates.

Skype credits can be purchased either through the application, from the Skype website, or by purchasing Skype cards from retail outlets.
Different calls will have different rates.

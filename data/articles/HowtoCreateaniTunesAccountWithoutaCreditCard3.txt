 If you recently changed regions for an existing Apple ID, you must provide a payment method and update your billing information. After doing so, you can remove your credit card from the account again.
 You cannot set a payment method as none if the Apple ID has a balance due. Update your payment information so that the balance can be paid, and then you can set your payment method to "None".

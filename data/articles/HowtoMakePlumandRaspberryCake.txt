, Into the mixer bowl add the butter, the sugar, and the vanilla. Start the mixer on a low speed and combine the ingredients. After a minute, increase the speed to medium and mix until the mixture becomes pale, which should take 2-3 minutes.
 At this point you can begin adding the eggs. Add 1 egg and wait for it to mix thoroughly with the batter, then repeat this process with the other 2 eggs until they are well-incorporated into the cake mix.
 Add the flour, the baking soda, and the baking powder to the sieve. Next, using a spoon, pass the ingredients through the sieve into an empty bowl, then mix in the salt.
 With the mixer now on a slow speed, add some of the flour mix and then some of the yoghurt to the bowl. Repeat until all of the flour mix and the yoghurt are incorporated. Turn off the mixer, scrape the cake mix from the beater, and set aside.
 Next, add the plums, folding them in gently so as not to break them. Then, carefully add the raspberries. Now place the cake mix into the loaf tin, filling it to about three quarters of full.
 The cake is now ready to go into the oven. Bake for 50-55 minutes. After this time test the cake by putting a wooden skewer into its centre. If the skewer comes out cleanly, the cake has finished baking.
 Set the cake aside to cool down to room temperature. After the cake has cooled, remove from the pan. It should slide out with little effort.

 To keep your lips looking soft and supple, make a homemade scrub out of sugar and honey (or oil). Exfoliating your lips eliminates the dead skin that can accumulate overtime, and can stimulate circulation in your lips. Mix one tablespoon of sugar (brown sugar or cane sugar is preferred) with a teaspoon of honey or coconut oil and mix the scrub together. Gently rub the mixture on your lips for 2-3 minutes, and rinse off with water., Keeping your lips moisturized is a great way to enhance your natural pout, because conditioned lips look more plump than dry lips. Always carry lip balm with you, and apply a generous amount to your lips whenever they feel dry. Be sure to condition your lips after exfoliating them as well., After you've finished brushing your teeth, turn your toothbrush onto your lips. Lightly brush your lips in small circular motions to increase blood flow. Increasing the blood flow in your lips will make them temporarily fuller., Drinking water and taking skin vitamins is a great way to naturally enhance your lips. Try to drink at least 8-12 glasses of water everyday, and try to take a skin or multivitamin daily. Having better health will give you a natural glow, even in your lips.

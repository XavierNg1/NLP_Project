 Your main goal is to steal back the money and escape the estate. You should just run to the greenhouse and take down several waves of White's troops. After that just run into the house through the cellar. You will now enter the house, it's best just to sneak and have several machine guns with you in case your spotted.;
, In the Haitian level, in order to sneak past the red haired woman just crouch behind the desk and slowly walk around her. If she finds you, you get killed. In the opera level try looking for ways to distract enemies like shooting crates and working with machines.
 Just don't do anything strange and you'll be fine. Don't hit any buttons when cut scenes happen. Look for a laundry cart to find a way through a vent

, Keep the AK-47 for long fire fights and use your Walther P99 in close combat. Remember to melee if an enemy comes to close.


If you don't have ammo or are in a room with a lot of enemies, half the time you can sneak around them.
 The troops wear black and can be hard to see.

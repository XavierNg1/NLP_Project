 You want to talk to people that you can trust. If you don’t know anyone, then ask around. Talk to people who have bought undeveloped land and ask who their real estate agent was.


Make sure the agents are familiar with the market for undeveloped land. Many agents only sell homes, so they might not have any idea what a vacant lot could be worth.
You also need to talk to more than one agent. In fact, you should speak to as many as you can, since you will get a much broader perspective that way., Don’t be nervous. Real estate agents are approached regularly by sellers hoping to figure out how much they can ask for their property. Call up the agents and introduce yourself. Then ask how much you could get for the property if you put it on the market today.


Say something like, “Let’s say I list this property with you today. What’s the most I can get if I need to sell it in the next six months?”The agent probably needs to look at the property, so meet them to show them around.
 The real estate agent might impress you with their knowledge and enthusiasm. If so, you should consider hiring them to help you buy or sell undeveloped land.

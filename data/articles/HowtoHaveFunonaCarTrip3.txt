 When you take a road trip, it is tempting to eat along the interstate in an effort to “make good time.” Rather than rushing to your destination, slow down and enjoy the small communities and towns you are passing through. One of the best ways to experience a town or city is through its local eateries.


Stop for breakfast, lunch, or dinner at a locally owned restaurant.
Grab snacks and a coffee at the farmer’s market.
Pick out restaurants you would like to try before leaving on the trip or ask locals for recommendations., Your route to and from your final destination will be dotted with wonderful natural landmarks, quirky tourist traps, and unique historical sites. Don’t be afraid to deviate from your route to take in the region’s beauty and lore. Take a brief hiatus from the care whenever you see an attraction that peaks your interest.


Use the stops as restroom breaks.
Potential stops include local museums, factories, flea markets, roadside attractions, national parks, sports facilities, and university or college campuses., After spending endless miles cooped up in a car, road trippers can get a little stiff and stir crazy. Instead of pressing on, set aside time to stretch your legs and breathe fresh air. You and your passengers can stop at parks, playgrounds, waterfalls, caves, lakes, beaches, mountains, or deserts.


Have a picnic at the park
Take a thirty minute walk in the woods
Play frisbee at the playground
Dip your toes into an ocean, lake, river, or stream
Take a guided tour through a cave or cavern
Admire the beauty of the desert or the power of a waterfall

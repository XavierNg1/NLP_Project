 Rent tradelines were typically not allowed on your credit score. However, this changed in 2011 when Experian announced they would be including rent. Recently, TransUnion also announced that they would also be including rent data. It is important to know that unlike other accounts, you cannot report rent directly to the credit bureaus yourself, and you must use a third-party service to do so.The three third-party rent reporting services are William Paid, Rental Karma, and Rent Reporters.
 All three services generally work the same: you submit and verify your payments to the reporting service, and then they send the information to the credit bureaus. The major difference is cost.


Rent reporters is free for the first thirty days,and then costs $9.95 per month. Rental Karma is free, and William Paid is free but only if you pay your rent via electronic funds transfer. If you pay with cash or credit card, the fee is 2.95% of the rental amount.
Visit the websites for each of these services to register or to learn more.
 While creditors will see rent tradelines on your account, it currently does not affect the main credit score, which is known as the FICO score. It does, however, affect your Vantage Score, which is another type of credit score that your creditors will often take into account.

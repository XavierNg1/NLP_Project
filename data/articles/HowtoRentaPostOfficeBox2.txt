 If you are over 16 and have a permanent address in the United Kingdom, you can apply for a variety of Royal Mail post office boxes.


Note that you must have a permanent address. If your address is in "care of (c/o)" of someone else, you cannot apply for a post office box.
Be aware that you cannot choose which post office you would like to use. The one that usually distributes your mail is where you're allowed to have a post office box.
 Royal Mail provides three options:


PO Box Collect: This is a traditional post office box. You'll travel to your local post office branch and physically collect your mail.
PO Box Delivery: Items addressed to your post office box will be delivered to your home or business address.
PO BoxÂ® with Transfer of Normal Address Mail: This places all the mail sent to your name in your post office box, where you will physically collect it.
 Royal Mail post office boxes may be leased for 6 or 12 months. Payments must be made in advance.
 See Sources and Citations (below) for a link to an application. Your application should include:


Proof of address. You can submit one of the following items as proof of address. The item you include must be the original, and less than 3 months old:

Bank or building society statement (dated within the last 3 months)
Phone bill for a landline only
Utility bill (gas, electricity or water dated within the last 3 months)
Council tax bill
Royal Mail Account number for an existing service


Payment for your post office box; you can pay via direct debit/check or postal order.
 Your post office box should be ready for use in two weeks or less. Royal Mail will notify you when your address has been verified and your box is prepared. Post your application to: PO Box Application Team, PO Box 740, Barnsley, S73 0ZJ

 The longer the better, and the softer the better (maraschino cherries are good because they're already very soft).


Show the audience that it isn't in a knot already before putting it into your mouth.
Move the stem around in your mouth to increase its flexibility by softening it with your saliva. You can chew and bend it if this helps to soften it.
 The easiest way to do this is lengthwise, so that the folded stem lies along the length of your tongue, one end on the top of your tongue, one end on the bottom.
 Bite down gently until the two ends cross over, forming a loop with an X-shape crossover of the stem ends.
 Try using your teeth to rotate the looped stem toward the end you are trying to push through. This might take a few minutes, but it is possible, especially with practice!

 The meal plan provided by your doctor or dietitian is your best option for maintaining your blood sugar. Don’t add new foods or change what they’ve given you. If you want to sometimes deviate from the plan, talk to your doctor or dietitian in advance about how to do it safely., If you’re on medication for diabetes, make sure you take it in the correct amounts and at the times directed. These medications will help keep your blood sugar from getting too high, but if you use them incorrectly they could cause your sugar to drop too low., Eating several small meals throughout the day rather than three big meals can help you keep your blood sugar steady. Choose balanced meals that are on your meal plan.

Eating several small meals is especially helpful for people who have reactive hypoglycemia, which occurs when your blood sugar drops because your body releases too much insulin after meals.Healthy meals are low carb, with higher levels of protein and fats. For example, eat a salad with grilled chicken or a half sandwich with a cup of soup.
 Stay on top of your numbers so that you know where you stand. This will allow you to eat a snack before your sugar gets low, or take insulin if your sugar is unexpectedly high.Carry your testing kit everywhere.
Test before and after your planned meals.

 Not all pull-up diapers are sized equally. Although most older children won't fit into those meant for toddlers, those that do, tend to wear them. For those that can't fit into those toddler-styled ones, most bedwetting diapers are of a pull-up style, yet offer the protection most older children need. And if you still can't fit into a bedwetting diaper, most disposable adult diapers offer the ability to pull the garment up and down as the "change" seems fit.;
, Never purchase cheap pull-up pants. Do your research. Call the company. Remember that pull-up pants are measured by the hip or waist, whichever is larger.
 Although most pull-up pants aren't as hard to change as those of diapers, some people will need to downplay these facts, and provide a worry-free environment where "not a care in the world" can bother them.

 Most people will tend to shy away from using them at school, but to get the same effect or to use the pull-up pants up at an increased rate, continue using them at school.

 Use the easy-open side to wrap the pant up and throw it into the trash collection container.

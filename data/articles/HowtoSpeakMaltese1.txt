, Each vowel has a long and short sound, similar to English vowels. Pronounce the vowels like this:


A: A long “a” sounds like a in “far.” A short “a” sounds like “u” in “shut.”
E: A long “e” sounds like the e in “shed.” A short “e” sounds like the ai in “hair.”
I: A long “i” sounds like ee in “jeep.” A short “i” sounds like I in “fit.”
O: A long “o” sounds like aw in “law.” A short “o” sounds like o in “got.”
U: A long “u” sounds like oo in “fool.” A short “u” sounds like u in “full.”

, Many of the letters in the Maltese alphabet sound like their English equivalents. These letters include: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, S, T, V, and W.


Ħ makes a sound like a regular H in English (as in “house”).
Ż makes a sound like a regular Z in English (as in “fuzz”).
 Several consonants in Maltese take on a different sound than its English equivalent. These include:


C sounds like “ch” in “church.”
Ġ sounds like “j” in “join.”
H is silent if it’s in the middle of a word. If it’s at the end of a word, it sounds like the “h” in “hen.”
J sounds like “y” in “yes.”
GH is primarily silent and usually prolongs the sound of the vowel that it follows.
R is trilled, similar to a Scottish or Spanish R sound.
X sounds like “sh” in “sheep.”
Z sounds like “ts” as in “hats.”

, A “q” in Maltese is pronounced with a glottal stop. A glottal stop is a sound that is made by completely closing the glottis (the area at the opening of the vocal cords at the top of the larynx) and then opening it up again. This is done very quickly.To do a glottal stop, speak the part of the word before the Q. Stop your air flow when you get to the Q (don’t pronounce the Q, of course), and then pick up the word again to pronounce the letters after the Q. This sounds similar to when a Scottish or Cockney accent speaks a word like “better” or “fitting.”Search online for audio examples of what a glottal stop sounds like.

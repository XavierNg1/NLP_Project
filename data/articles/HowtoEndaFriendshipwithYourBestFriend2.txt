 Letting a friendship fade is not instantaneous, and your friend may take a while to catch on.
 You might take longer to respond than usual, and/or give shorter responses that are less interesting.



"I can't. I have a lot of homework."
"I already made plans for then." (You don't have to mention that those plans are a warm bath and a phone call with your dad.)

, This doesn't mean you need to ignore your friend completely; you can be polite to them while focusing most of your attention on other things.


Don't get into long conversations about your friend's problems. Change the subject after a little while, or say you have to go and encourage them to talk to someone else.
In group settings, be polite to your friend, without focusing much attention on them individually.

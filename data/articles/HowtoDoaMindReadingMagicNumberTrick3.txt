 Tell the crowd that you will be able to increase your volunteer’s memory through telepathy or the power of your mind. Interact with the crowd and let them know that most people can only remember 5 or 9 letters but you can increase it all the way to 14., Choose these four letters and read them aloud at a natural rate. Read one letter for every second and drop your voice after the “K”. Do not repeat the letters.The average person should easily be able to remember these letters.
Don’t say the letters too slowly or the crowd will expect you to use the same rate throughout the trick.
 Again, say these letters at a rate about one letter per second and do not repeat the sequence. Depending on your volunteer, he may or may not be able to remember these 6 letters., The majority of people won’t be able to remember this sequence. Again, read these letters at a rate of a letter per second without repeating the sequence., It is important to emphasize the limits of human memory. The trick works because it seems almost impossible to memorize more than 10 letters but now you'll use magic to allow a random person to increase his capacity to 14 letters.
 The trick uses the principle of memory chunking. By breaking up large units of information into chunks between 5 and 9 items, we are able to increase the capacity of our memories. The 14 letters is actually divided into 4 chunks, the words frog, bat, pig, and duck.If the volunteer gets it wrong, ask the audience if someone thinks that they have got it and get them to shout it out.

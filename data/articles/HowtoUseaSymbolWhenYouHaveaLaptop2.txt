 Macs are much more standardized than PCs, so this should work on any working Mac keyboard.
 Note that the selection of available symbols is much more limited than on a PC, and that each is caused by pressing and holding the Option key while pressing one or more of a variety of keys, rather than a strictly of a code. You can find lists of available keyboard symbols at sites like http://fsymbols.com/keyboard/mac/.


Accented letters are created by holding down the Option key, then pressing a key for the type of accent, then the letter you want to accent. If it is a capital letter, you will need to hold down shift as well. The accented letter Á, for instance, is obtained by pressing Option and Shift, then pressing E and A in sequence, then releasing all keys.
Symbols other than accented letters are still created by holding the Option key and pressing another key, but rather than making the symbols capitalized, the shift key changes the symbol altogether. For instance, holding down Option and pressing = creates ≠, while also holding down the shift key creates ±.

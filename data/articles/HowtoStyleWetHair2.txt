 Use your fingers or a comb to part your hair down the center of your head. Then pull back a section from the top on each side of your center part to create two side parts extending to the backs of both your ears. Clip these two side sections of hair so they stay out of the way., With the section of your hair (the section in the middle of the back of your head that you have not clipped up yet), create two even ponytails a little bit above the nape of your neck. Tie these ponytails very close together in the middle of your head, so you canâ€™t see the part separating them.Use small, thin, elastic hair ties to tie these ponytails.
 Twist each ponytail one at a time, twisting from the base of the ponytail down to the ends. When you get to the end of the ponytail, continue twisting. The ponytail will start to twist and wrap around itself. Wrap the ponytail around its base and tuck the ends into the elastic hair tie.Twist and wrap the other ponytail around its base and secure it, so you have two, small buns right next to each other.
 Unclip the two side sections of your hair, and twist back one section at a time, starting from your forehead. Continue to twist the hair back towards the two small buns. Lay the twisted side section over the top of the two buns, and wrap it underneath if your hair is long enough.Twist the other side section of your hair, and again, lay that section over the top of the two buns, overlapping the first twisted side section.
 When your two side sections are both twisted and wrapped around the two small buns, secure them with a few bobby pins.

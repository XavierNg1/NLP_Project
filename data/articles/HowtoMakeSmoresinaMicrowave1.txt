 Place one of the graham cracker halves on a plate with a paper towel on it. Set the other graham cracker half aside. The paper towel will prevent the cracker from getting soggy.


If you can't find any graham crackers, you can use another similar honey-cinnamon flavored cracker instead.;
, If you are using one of those large chocolate bars that have brick-like lines, use those lines as a guide. The chocolate should be a little smaller than the graham cracker.
 Stand it up on the flat side, so that it doesn't roll off when you move the plate. Do not place the other graham cracker half on top just yet; you will do that at the end.
 Put the plate with the s'more on it into the microwave, and heat it on high for 15 seconds.The chocolate will start to melt and become soft, and the marshmallow will puff up.


If the marshmallow puffs up too much, heat the s'more at 5-second intervals. Let the marshmallow deflate before heating it again., Press down on the s'more to seal it. Be careful not to press so hard that the graham cracker breaks.
 S'mores are tasty while they are still hot, but they won't be much fun to eat if you burn your tongue on them!

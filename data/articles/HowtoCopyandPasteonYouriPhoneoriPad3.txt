 The picture can be from a message you received, a website, or a document. Doing so opens a pop-up menu.
 If the image can be copied, Copy will be one of the menu options.


Images from many websites, documents, and social media apps can be copied, but not always.
 Do so in an app that allows you to paste images, such as Messages, Mail, or Notes.
 Now you've pasted the copied image into the selected location.

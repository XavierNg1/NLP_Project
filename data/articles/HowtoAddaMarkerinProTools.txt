 From your Pro Tools session, go to View in the toolbar, hover over "Rulers," and verify that "Markers" has a check-mark next to it. If it doesn't, click directly on "Markers" to place a check-mark next to it.;
, Locate the spot in your audio track where you want to add a marker and click directly on that point. Press the "Enter" key on your keyboard to bring up the New Memory Location dialog box.
 At the top of the New Memory Location dialog box, type in a name for your marker next to the "Name" field. To the left of the name field, you can designate a specific number for your marker or leave it as is. The number field can be used to overwrite existing markers or to reorder your markers.
 Under the Time Properties section, make sure "Marker" is designated, otherwise click the radio option next to it on the left.
 All the options in the General Properties section are pieces of information that can be stored with your marker and are completely optional. Selecting Zoom Settings will store the current zoom setting with the marker and Pre and Post Roll Times will also be stored with the marker if selected. Other options you may choose to include are showing and hiding tracks, storing the track height, and recollection of enabled Edit and Mix Groups.
 Although adding comments is also optional, you may want to add specific information about the marker you are adding.
 When you are finished customizing your marker, click on the OK button in the bottom right of the window to add the marker to your audio file. You will now see a yellow marker in the shape of a diamond appear on your Timeline where you have added it.

 Canaries suffering from blood mites may have powdery lesions around the face, beak, or eyes.Other symptoms include weakness, lack of appetite, or lack of energy. Be on your guard if your canary seems to be sleeping more than usual., This type of mite in particular can usually be found on the head and around the crest of the bird. With your fingers, gently brush the feathers around the head of your canary. The mites will appear as small red specks. After a few seconds, the specks may move and disappear into the feathers. The mites are small, so look carefully., If you are concerned that mites have moved into the cage, you can try using a white cloth. Fold the cloth so that it fits in the cage, and place it on the bottom. Leave it there overnight. In the morning, if you see any small red specks on the cloth, you may have an infestation., If you donâ€™t see mites on your birds but suspect there might be an infestation, examine the cage closely, especially the nesting box. Blood mites like dark spots and are often found in the cracks and bedding of the cage. Use a flashlight to shine into these dark areas. You may see hundreds of tiny specks milling about in these spots.

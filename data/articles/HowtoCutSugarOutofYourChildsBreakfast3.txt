 Soda offers no nutritional benefit to children and contains only empty calories from added sugars or artificial sweeteners. Children should be drinking minimal soda in general, but should especially avoid it during breakfast, when their bodies need nutrition to give them energy for the day.It goes without saying that children should not be given energy drinks such as Red Bull, Monster, Rock Star, and others. These drinks are packed with both sugar and caffeine and, if drank for breakfast, will first make children jittery and then tired for the rest of the day.
 Many fruit juices—especially those marketed to children—have added sugars, and are nearly as high in sugar as sodas are. Fruit juices also contain no fiber.Read the nutrition label before you purchase fruit juice, and avoid any that have primarily artificial ingredients or that contain large percentages of sugar. Sports drinks—such as Gatorade and PowerAde—are also very high in sugar; discourage your child from drinking these as well.

If your child demands fruit juices, you can slowly wean the child from the juice by diluting the juice with a little bit of water. This will reduce the sugar content in the child’s drink, and the amount of water can be slowly increased over time.
 Although limited amounts of naturally flavored fruit juices—which do contain some healthy vitamins—are fine, children only need to drink milk or water on a daily basis. These drinks will keep kids hydrated and give them calcium without boosting their morning sugar intake.If children are reluctant to stop drinking soda or fruit juices, you can negotiate: ask them to drink a glass of water before each glass of fruit juice.
Alternately, serve milk or water in glasses that appeal to children and distract from the contents of the glass. Look for glasses or plastic cups in fun shapes and colors that appeal to your child.

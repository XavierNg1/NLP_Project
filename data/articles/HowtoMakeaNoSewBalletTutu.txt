 Measure around the waist. Measure the length you want the tutu to be. Cut the tulle to 2x the waist and length. You can also triple the waist if you want a fluffier tutu.






;
, Holding the tulle with the longest side facing you, Cut about 2.4 inches (6 cm) of vertical strips.
,, Making a loop with the top, pass it under the elastic and pull the tails through the loop. The strip is now attached to the big circle. Repeat making and tying on the strips until you have tied strips the whole way around the circle of elastic.









For a fuller and fluffier tutu, pull the tie tighter (you would need more strips and at least another 1 meter (3.2 feet) or more for an adult).
With these measurements, 10 loosely tied strips will cover 15cm (6") of length, which is more than adequate for a fun tutu. For the more elaborate tutu, the tightest knots of 10 strips will cover 5cm (2").
 The result is one reasonable tutu from 1 meter (3.2 feet) of net (tulle) and it is long enough for a child or a small adult, limited only by the length of the elastic. It can do the job as it is or be dressed up by adding another colour, a circular cover skirt, a few spangles, sequins or rhinestones. Enjoy.

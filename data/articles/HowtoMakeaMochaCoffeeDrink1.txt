 Here is what you'll need to make a mocha coffee drink using brewed coffee:


8 ounces freshly brewed coffee (or instant)
1/2 cup (4 ounces) milk
1 tablespoon (15 g) cocoa powder
1 tablespoon (15 g) warm water
Sugar (optional)
Whipped cream and cocoa (optional, for topping);
, To be closer to authentic, you'll want to use double-strength, dark-roasted coffee. And you could use instant coffee if you're in a pinch, but brewed coffee is just so much better.


Coffee reaches "double-strength" when it's around 4 tablespoons (60 g) of coffee grinds to 6 ounces of water.
 Combine equal parts of each and stir up in a small bowl. You'll need about 2 tablespoons (30 g) for one mocha drink.
 The more coffee you have, the more chocolate syrup you'll probably want. But be sure to leave room for milk!

, How much? Well, how big is your mug? 1/3 to 1/2 cup (3 to 4 ounces) is usually plenty.


You want the milk between 140 and 160°F (60 - 70°C). Any hotter than that and the milk burns, losing its flavor.
 If there's any foam, be sure to hold it back with a spoon, so it layers above the mocha on top.


If you like a really, really sweet mocha, add a teaspoon of sugar to your drink before you top it with foam.
 Chocolate or caramel syrup -- or even cinnamon or turbinado sugar -- is a nice touch, too.

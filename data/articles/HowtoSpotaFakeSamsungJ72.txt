 A quick way to check the authenticity of a Samsung J7 is to check its IMEI in an IMEI-checking website. There are a few different ways you can find the number:


Dial *#06# from the J7. As soon as you enter the final #, the IMEI will appear on the screen (it will say “IMEI” just above the number).
Look for the IMEI on the packaging, or under the battery. You’ll have to slide the back cover from the J7 to access the battery.
If you’re buying a J7 online, ask the seller (if you’re buying online) to give you the number.
 You don’t need a user account or password to use this tool—just type the IMEI into the blank.
 Now you’ll see a bunch of information about your phone. You should see the word “Samsung” next to “Brand.” If you don’t, the phone is not a legitimate Samsung product.

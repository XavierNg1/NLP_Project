 The preferences file contains program defaults for Firefox, such as the starting home page, tab configuration and more. If your web browser is facing difficulties displaying web pages properly, you will be able to reset your preferences to the default settings. You will need to navigate to your profile’s folder. You can quickly access the folder under Troubleshooting Information. You can open this in one of two ways.


Click on the ☰ icon located in the top right of the browser window then click on the �>Troubleshooting Information.
Activate the menu bar by right clicking an empty space in the window tabs at the top of the browser. Click on “Menu Bar” to reveal Firefox’s menu bar. Go to Help>Troubleshooting Information.
 Under the “Application Basics” click on Show Folder to open a file explorer window with your profile files open. Close all instances of Firefox.
 Locate the file named “prefs.js” and either rename the file or delete it.


Delete or rename additional preference files such as “prefs.js.moztmp” or “user.js” as well.
 Firefox will automatically create a new preferences file for your profile.

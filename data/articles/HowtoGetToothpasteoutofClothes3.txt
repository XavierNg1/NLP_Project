 Take a napkin and then gather some detergent, water, and olive oil. Pour the detergent and water together in a glass, and mix them.


Then, take the oil, and put it over the stain. Don’t use too much oil or it could ruin the clothing.
Pour the water mixture onto the toothpaste stain next. After a few minutes, wipe it off. You may still need to wash the clothing further in a bucket or washing machine. However, this should help remove the stain.
 Take a lemon, and cut it in half. Then, rub the pulp side on the stain for about one minute.


Wash it off with normal detergent powder. You can also mix freshly squeezed lemons with baking soda, which is a natural remedy that is great to use for cleaning.Wait for the fizzing to stop. Once done, mix it again until it becomes pasty. Then slowly rub the mix on the stained area. Use one teaspoon of baking soda and two teaspoons of lemon juice. You could also try using rubbing alcohol on the stain.
 Vinegar gets stains and foul smells out of almost everything. Wash a small load of clothes with a cup of vinegar or add some to your bucket of water.


You can also pre-treat the clothing with vinegar if it’s super stained or smelly. Then, put it in the washing machine following the instructions above.
It's best to use white vinegar. Mix one part vinegar with 2 parts water. Mix and apply to the stain. Let it sit on the clothing for about one minute. Then, blot it with a clean dry cloth. Rinse and launder.

 Tap the “Create” button on the rightmost part of the header tabs of the Events screen. A small window for “Create Event” will appear.


Type in the name of your event in the first field. Are you celebrating a birthday, a baptism, a wedding? Put it in and make it interesting.
You can put some additional info for your guests, such as attire, gift registries, and directions in the Details field.
Clearly indicate where your event will take place in the Where field. Make it very specific so that your guests can easily find it.

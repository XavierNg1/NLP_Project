 Whether you're in a theater or at home on a couch, a movie can be a great moment to instigate physical contact. Take her hand lightly. If she likes you, she'll hold your hand back, or give your hand a squeeze. If she doesn't, she'll move her hand away.


If she holds your hand or moves closer to you, you can put an arm around her and see how she reacts to that. Ask if it's okay if you can't tell what she wants.;
, Saying goodbye is a great moment to make a move, because there is a quick exit strategy for both of you. This is probably the best move to make on a first date. Make sure it's clear that you're leaving, so she doesn't feel pressured. If you're driving, drop her off and walk her to her door. Make it clear you don't expect to be invited in.


Go for a hug and a kiss on the cheek first. If she moves away, squeezes you quickly and lets go, or seems otherwise uninterested, thank her for the nice evening and leave. If she holds on, moves closer, or offers you her lips, kiss her.
 If you're on a date and you're taking a walk together, or going from one place to another, you can initiate some low-stakes public intimacy. Try holding hands, putting an arm around her shoulders or waist, or just touching her arm. She'll probably move away if she's uncomfortable, but ask to make sure.

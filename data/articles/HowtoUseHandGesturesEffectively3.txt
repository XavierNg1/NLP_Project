 Even if you think you are comfortable talking to someone, a number of ways you move your body can betray this. Certain hand gestures show nervousness, timidity, and even submissiveness. Hands in your pockets, for example, gives off a signal you may be nervous. Hands crossed in front give off a notion of weakness or timidity as if you are in need of protection.Squeezing hands together is also a gesture that can convey a "self-soothing" gesture that you are nervous or fearful., While hands can certainly make you a more effective communicator, and even cause people to be more comfortable around, they can also detract from your ability to communicate effectively.


It is recommended keeping your hand gestures in a "box," while talking to others; a space from the top of your chest to the bottom of your waist. What this means is you should keep within certain parts of your body because then it allows people to keep looking at you and what you're saying, rather than trying to track your hands., Sometimes people who have trouble finding words use hand gestures as a sign of nervousness or distraction. Avoid doing this as it does not help clarify your point anymore, but only serves to likely confuse people more.If you find yourself unable to come up with what you want to say next, slow your hands down. Perhaps put them in a calming gesture in front of you, as this is better than using wild hand movements to exasperate difficulties communicating.

 Belle spends most of her day exploring her town or the castle on her feet. Choose shoes that are comfortable but still feminine, like a pretty ballet flat or a small kitten heel. Again, go for versatility and choose shoes in solid, neutral colors such as black, brown, grey, or blue. If these shoes are too boring for you, consider buying some with pretty bows or sequins on them.
 Although Belle is sensible, she definitely has a bold and daring side! When going out, wear some high heels in a bright and eye-catching color.

 If you’ve tried a number of tactics and nothing has worked, then it may be time to call in the wildlife professionals. Get ahold of a local wildlife refuge or zoo and request contact information for an avian expert. This person will come out to your location and may even relocate large bird flocks.Again, be prepared to pay for these services. You may be able to contract with an expert if repeated treatments and visits are necessary.
 Contact Wildlife Services or Animal Control in your area to see if traps are available for rent or to borrow. If not, you can buy a “bob” or “funnel” trap online relatively cheaply and resell it afterwards. Place the traps around the infested areas and check them daily. When you find a bird inside, drive as far away as you can and release it., Look into the laws in your area before attempting to harm any pest birds. Some species are protected by law, whereas others are considered “nonprotected” and can be killed by shooting or chemical agents, also called avicides.For example, certain states in the U.S. allow citizens to shoot pigeons and sparrows as a control measure. But, it is still recommended that you exhaust all other measures before even considering this type of action.
 Some people may find this tactic repugnant, but it is one guaranteed way to reduce your pest bird population. Remove or destroy eggs once every two weeks in the spring and summer months. Pull down nests from window eaves, gutters, and other undesired places at the same time.








A less messy method is to give the bird population birth control pellets via feeders. However, you won’t be able to guarantee that only certain types of birds are affected.Depending on the bird type you may need to contact the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to get a permit for egg or nest removal.

 In a healthy relationship, couples make time for one another in their busy schedules. If you wish to passively hint that this person is no longer worth your time, limit your interactions with them. Instead of hanging out with your partner or the person crushing on you, pick up a hobby, play video games, hang out with other people, or become highly focused on your career. Eventually, they may decide you aren’t worth their time either.


When you do spend time together, act distracted or leave early., Couples loyally support each other through the highs and the lows of life. If you wish to give this person a reason to stop loving you, revoke your support. Do not attend their sporting events or concerts. Do not ask them about their test or pitch. When they come to you for help or advice, minimize their problems or support the other party. Your inability to provide moral support, may make them search for someone more loyal., Partners rely on words and actions to communicate their feelings with each other. By withholding your ability to be vulnerable, you will successfully create an emotional void in your relationship. Refuse to share your feelings—when you are hurt, refuse to talk about it. Avoid all forms of physical contact. Overtime, they may deem you emotionally unavailable and an undesirous partner.

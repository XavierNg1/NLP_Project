 A good skin care routine includes washing all your skin regularly (and your face twice a day) and keeping all your skin properly moisturized and hydrated. Skin hydration can be achieved by using a moisturizer, but it is also important to consume water (and other liquids) to keep your body hydrated, which can also affect your skin., If you are going outside, or if you’re staying inside but there are a lot of windows, always remember to apply sunscreen to your exposed skin. In colder months when most of your body is covered with clothing, it is still important to apply sunscreen to your face every day.Harmful UV rays can work their way through clouds and damage your skin, so it doesn’t have to be sunny for you to obtain sun damage.
Don’t forget to protect your lips by using a lip balm that contains SPF.
If you are outside in the sun, reapply sunscreen every 2 hours.
 In addition to sunscreen, you can also protect your skin using clothing and hats, and you can protect your eyes using sunglasses. It is also recommended that you consider staying in the shade between the hours of 11am and 3pm when the sun is at its peak.

 Lie and say you are not feeling well. You can claim to have a cold, a sore throat, a flare up of a condition you really have, a sudden stomachache, or a general sense of unwellness.Don't give too much detail. Just say, "I have to cancel our plans today, I'm afraid. I have a sore throat and I am not feeling well."

, Claim to have forgotten that you made another plan at the same time. Say it's something you can't get out of. It could be a date with a friend, a medical appointment, or a work meeting.For example, say: "I made plans with my dad ages ago, and I just forgot to put them in my calendar. I can't really change on him, so I have to ask you to let me give you a rain check for today!"

, You can say you have to stay late, go in early, have a meeting, or work from home. Cite the time of year if it is a busy one.You could tell them, "I'm so sorry to change our plans, but this is our busy season and I have to do catch up all weekend."
Remember to stick to your lie! Don't head out on the town that night if you canceled on someone--they might see you.

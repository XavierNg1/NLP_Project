 If it is just through the epidermis, you may be lucky enough to pull it back out the way it went in, but if it has a barb on it, and the barb is through the skin, you have to address that issue before removing it, as the barb will rip more tissue out with it as it comes.;
, This will decrease the likelihood of infection.
 Shallowly embedded hooks may be pulled out even if the barb is beneath the skin, but only if the hook is small, and has a thin barb, or it is just beneath the skin itself, and isn't deep enough to be in the muscles, tendons, or cartilage beneath the skin.


For subcutaneously embedded hooks, grasp the shank with a pair of pliers, and pull it the opposite direction it went in.
For shallow muscular puncture, you may be able to cut the shank of the hook with pliers or diagonal cutters (assuming you have them in your tackle box), and push the hook in a curving direction back through the skin adjacent to the original penetration. Leave as much shank as possible so you can grip it while you push the hook through, then grip the point and remove the hook where it emerges through the skin.
For very deep puncture, you will probably need to wrap the hook to keep it from moving, and seek medical attention, since you may cause serious tissue damage no matter which way you remove it yourself.
, Be sure that your tetanus shot is effective.

 Attach the yarn to the crochet hook using a standard slipknot.


Note that most yarns will work well with this pattern. Heavier yarns will form thicker spirals, while lighter yarns will have a looser, more delicate appearance.
If necessary, please see the "Tips" section for instructions on how to make a slipknot.;
, From the loop on your hook, work a series of chain stitches to form the foundation row of your scarf.


Continue chaining until the length reaches the length you desire for your scarf. As a general rule, 180 chains will work well for an adult-size scarf and 90 chains will work well for a child-size scarf.
If you need further instruction on making chain stitches, please see the "Tips" section.
 Work one double crochet into the second chain currently from the hook.


This is the start of your first working row.
See the "Tips" section if you need help with the double crochet stitch.
 Work one double crochet into the next chain, then two double crochet in the chain after that.


Repeat this pattern across the entire chain. When you reach the end of the chain, you've completed your first row.
Note that the row can end on either a set of one double crochet or two double crochet, depending on how many chains are in your foundation row. Both options are acceptable.
 For the second row, work two double crochet in each double crochet of the previous row. Continue until you reach the end of the row.
 For each consecutive row, follow the technique used to complete the second row. Work as many rows as needed to achieve the scarf width you desire.


You can make the scarf as thin or wide as you wish, but a total of three to six rows will usually suffice.
 When you reach the final stitch of the final row, cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the work.


Weave the tails at both ends into the back side stitching of the scarf.
The completion of this step completes the project.

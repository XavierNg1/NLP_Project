 In some states, you can hire an attorney to handle only a portion of a legal matter, rather than the entire matter, because you can handle the rest of the case on your own. Instead of hiring a lawyer to represent you for all of the aspects of a case, you would simply hire her to consult on specific features of your case.


For example, you may be able to hire a lawyer just to go over any paperwork you're filing, just to give you advice on a certain situation, or just to tell you about your legal rights before you proceed with a course of action.
Note that not all states make this option available for lawyers under their rules of professional conduct. In several states, attorneys are required to handle the entire legal matter or withdraw from the case altogether. You will need to contact your local bar association in order to determine if any lawyers offer an unbundled option, or if it is even an option in your state.
 Your lawyer's time is your money, so the more you can do independently, the more money you will save. If you spend time calling your lawyer for explanation of legal terms that you can look up yourself, you are wasting money. Taking charge and handling as much of your case as you can can save money in the long run. For instance, you can probably file a petition for divorce on your own, in most cases, and later hire an attorney when it is time to attend a court hearing.
 The less time that an attorney has to spend explaining legal concepts and procedures to you, the less he or she will charge you. Plus, by educating yourself, you will have a clear sense as to what sorts of things you can handle on your own, and what will require the assistance of an attorney.

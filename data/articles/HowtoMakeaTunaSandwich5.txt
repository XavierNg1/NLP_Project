 You need to let the broiler warm up for several minutes before you toast the bread, otherwise it may not cook evenly.


You can find the “broil” setting on the far end of the oven-temperature dial on most ovens.
 How many times you drain and rinse is up to you, but draining and rinsing it at least once is recommended.


Use a can opener to open the can, but don’t remove the lid yet.
Holding the lid in place, flip the can over and hold it over the sink to drain the liquid.
Pull off the top of the can, and be careful not to cut yourself.
Take the tuna out of the can and place it in a strainer or colander.
Rinse the tuna thoroughly with water, then press the water out using a clean hand or a paper towel.
 Using a medium-sized bowl. combine the tuna, mayonnaise, lemon juice (if using), celery, onion, parsley, basil (if using), cilantro (if using), and vinegar.


Stir to combine.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Be sure to thoroughly combine all of the ingredients so that they’re distributed evenly throughout the mix.
 Place the bread on a baking sheet. Broil in the oven for 1 minute or until the bread is toasted.


Be careful not to burn the bread; don’t broil it for too long.
Remove from heat but leave the broiler on.
 Spread the tuna mix over 4 slices of the toasted bread, or, if using pita, place the mix inside each of the pita pockets.


Place one slice of cheese or a layer of Feta over the tuna spread.
Place a tomato slice on top of the cheese slice, then place a second slice or layer of cheese over the tomato.
 Place the assembled sandwiches on a baking sheet and broil again for 3 to 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted.


Keep a close eye on the sandwiches to ensure they don’t char or burn.
Remove from heat, turn off the broiler, and serve.

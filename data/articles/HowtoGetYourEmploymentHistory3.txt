 Credit reporting agencies aren't in the business of keeping records of your employment history, and they only have information if it was reported to them by a credit card company.


The information on your report may be spotty or outdated, but it might help jog your memory., You are entitled to receive one free credit report a year, and this website is the only free credit report service authorized by the Federal Trade Commission.Using another website could end up being a scam or costing you a lot of money in subscription fees.


Although the information on your credit report may not be as thorough as the information you could get from Social Security or from the IRS, it has the benefit of being free.
If you're looking for a job or contemplating a change in careers, it's probably a good idea to review your credit report anyway, as potential employers may pull it up when they are evaluating you for a job., Check the information available on each report, and correct inaccuracies if you see any.


If your report contains any employment information that bothers you, normally a simple request to the reporting agency is all it takes to have it removed.The employment information on each report may be different. For example, your Experian report will list your last known employer and occupation, but not any dates of employment. TransUnion, on the other hand, includes your current employer and occupation plus your previous employer. For both, your report includes the date your employment was last verified, the date you were hired, or the date your employment was reported.

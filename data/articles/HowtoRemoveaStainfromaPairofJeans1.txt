 This is particularly important if you think the stain might be oil-based or grease. Oil repels water, which means that pouring H20 on an oil stain could permanently set the stain making it almost impossible to remove it later.;
, This is a common mistake that should be avoided. Once the stain on your jeans comes in contact with water, it might actually become more difficult to remove it if the laundering doesn't get rid of it, that is.
 It's important to find a surface on which to place your stained garment. Make sure that it's okay if that surface gets dirty or otherwise compromised. Sometimes, while removing stains, the garment's color can fade through, and get onto whatever is beneath. The bathtub might be a place to consider.
 Depending on the stain, you'll be doing a fair amount of blotting. Old socks, T-shirts, and/or kitchen rags will do just fine as long as they're clean and preferably of light color. There's always a chance that the rag's color could seep onto your stained jeans, which would defy our present objective.
 You'll likely have to soak your garment before laundering it, and a medium sized, plastic tub (or bowl) will work great for that purpose.
 The longer a stain is left untreated, the tougher it'll be to get rid of it. While you might not be able to take your jeans off in the middle of dinner, treating it as soon as you get home is a good way to go.

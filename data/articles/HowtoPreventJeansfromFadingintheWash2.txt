 If you have somewhere to hang your jeans to dry, do so. Jeans fade less when hung up to dry.To prevent wrinkling, hang jeans up by the belt loops.
 If you need to use a dryer for any reason, such as needing the jeans dry right away, use the lowest heat setting possible. The higher the heat setting, the more likely the jeans are to fade., Never dry jeans outside on a clothing rack. Direct sunlight can cause jeans to fade. Always dry jeans inside, away from open windows or other sources of direct sunlight., If your jeans get dirty or start to smell, do not immediately throw them back in the wash. You can mist the jeans to remove an unwanted smell instead. You should only wash jeans every 4 to 5 weeks.Take a spray bottle. Fill it up halfway with cold water and halfway with vodka.
Mist your jeans and then place them in the freezer overnight to reduce the smell.

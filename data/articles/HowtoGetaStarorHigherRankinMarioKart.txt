 Beat the race track like you normally would in Time Trial without messing up or getting hit a lot by the opponents or even getting affected by the track's hazards. You should try to drift frequently, or do major shortcuts. You should even attempt to use the head start or use a wheelie.;
, When completing a Grand Prix cup, make sure to always be in first place for every track, not just having the most racing points. Also, make sure that you even are first at the end of each lap, and if you can't, try not to change positions a lot or drop ranks all the time. Making it to first at the last second for each race track will also decrease your overall performance.
 The worst thing that can happen to you in any game is constantly losing to your opponents. Make sure that you use a lot of defensive and evasive strategies to protect against the enemy. Be farther from each opponent as possible, or even be a troll to them if need be. Luck is needed to achieve this goal.
 If you keep falling or getting hindered by the track's hazards and obstacles, or even the enemies, then avoid them as much as possible. Use strategies to help protect and prevent yourself from losing. If you do get hit, try to be as quick as possible or use items to recover or zoom past the track when it happens.
 Learn and perfect helpful driving techniques such as boosting start, drifting, super drifting, snaking, trick maneuvering, wheelie, short-cuts, streamlining, item holding, and so on. This will make you seem better than you already are and actually helps in perfecting the other methods mentioned above.
 By going off road, not only does it slow you down but you get penalized by the game for doing so. Unless all you are doing is cutting corners or taking a quick shortcut, or using a boost or speed items to get by, don't ever go off-road or you will get penalized by the game.

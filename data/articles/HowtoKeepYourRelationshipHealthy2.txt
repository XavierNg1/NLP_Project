 Even if you have been together for a long time, it is important to still plan activities with your partner. Ideally, you should have one night a week that you spend together, but if you have children or other responsibilities, this may be difficult. Try to have a date night at least once a month.
 Relationships can become routine quickly. To keep the spark going, you may have to think of fun and creative ways to surprise your partner. Surprises can include fun activities, small gifts, or even a romantic night together. Some ideas include:


Cook their favorite meal
Buy their favorite treat after work
Give a romantic massage

, The healthiest relationships are ones in which there is an equal distribution of household work. Unfortunately, in most relationships, chores and household tasks fall disproportionately on one partner. Try doing your chores together to make it less of a burden and more of a couple activity. When there are bills to be paid, sit down and go over them together. By enforcing responsibility between the two of you, you will increase trust and strengthen your bond while spending quality time together., Being in a relationship does not mean you are glued to your partner permanently. Balance your time spent together with time spent apart. Go out with your friends; engage in personal hobbies; read a book. Most importantly, encourage your partner to do the same. The time you do spend together will be so much more precious, and you will not grow bored of each other., No matter what stage of the relationship you’re at or what your sexual situation is, you should be honest with your partner about your needs, desires, limits, and expectations. Encourage them to tell you as well. While this may seem awkward at first, it is an important aspect of every relationship.Sex should never be withheld as a punishment, nor should either partner engage in sex if they don’t want it.

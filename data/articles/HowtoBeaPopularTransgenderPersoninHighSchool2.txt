 Safety, acceptance, etc. are perfectly valid reasons not to come out, and you are not obligated to educate anyone. Your health comes first, and if that means not mentioning that you're transgender, that's okay.;
, Most high schoolers are absorbed in their own lives and dramas, so if you don't quite perform your gender perfectly, they won't notice or think much of it.
 If you're a girl with a slightly deep voice or a short guy, politeness will keep most people from pressing further.


Guys do tease each other about perceived weakness, a.k.a. femininity, and you may be on the receiving end if you're a trans guy. You can shrug it off as good-natured teasing, or if it bothers you, take the teaser aside in private and explain that it's kind of a sore spot and you'd like him to stop.
 You might feel gnawed at by worries that you don't pass, or saddled with dysphoria at needing to pretend to be someone whom you aren't. This is difficult, and it will be stressful at times.

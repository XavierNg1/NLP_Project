 You need to download a daily build of ScummVM, as the latest stable version (1.6.0) does not support the Neverhood yet.
 You don't need the game's original installer.,, A new game entry called "The Neverhood" should appear., You're good to go! Just select "The Neverhood" from the list of games, and either double click on the entry, or single click on it and press "Start" to play the game.

If you're still stuck, you can read ScummVM's user manual

 You don't want to stop what you are doing in other types of communication and interaction, but use it in conjunction with other tools.;
, Different types of media will attract different audience. Use that to your advantage. Find out what your media of choice offers and take advantage of it.
 Facebook, Twitter, Blogging, MySpace, and many other types draw in different 'crowds'. Use that.
 There are a lot of platforms, communities and tools available. Don't allow it to overwhelm you. Focus on what will cater to your audience. Also, just because you have a lot of followers doesn't mean anything. How much interaction is there?

, Social media allows people to share much more easily. Especially if you have an application or plug-in to use that facilitates it.


Create content that will encourage people to think, feel - and respond.
Work towards inspiring your audience to share and discuss.
, Even though you are generally working with an audience of more than one, treat each one like they matter. Speak to the individual.
 If you do too much too quickly, you will become overwhelmed and simply give up. Grow into your social media campaign.

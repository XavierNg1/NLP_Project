 One option for making the stars on your nails is to find a clear polish with small glitter. If you wanted, you could use the same color that you initially painted over the black. Using this small glitter may not add as much depth, but it is easier than using 5-6 different polishes.
 In addition to or instead of using small glitter, a clear polish with large pieces of silver glitter or confetti is a good option. Do a single coat of this over the top of your galaxy base for a finishing touch.
 Use white nail polish and a dotting tool or pen to add small white dots to represent stars. Vary their size to mimic the appearance of stars in real life, and to add the illusion of distance.
 Use white nail polish with a dotting tool to draw on small stars. Rather than trying to create a classic hand-drawn star shape, make small “x” marks to represent the glowing balls of gas. Similar to the dots, make every star a different size to add realism to your galaxy painting.

 If you’re copying an image, place your tracing paper over the top of the image and carefully draw the outline. Attempt to place it on as flat of a surface on your arm as possible. Otherwise, draw the tattoo you would like onto tracing paper (even if you don’t have to trace). You can use multiple shades of sharpie if you would like, but make sure it is a ‘sharpie’ and not another type of pen or ink.
 On the place you would like your tattoo, spread a layer of the gel deodorant. Make sure that there is enough that it doesn’t dry right away, but avoid putting so much of the gel that it prevents the paper from coming into contact with your skin.
 Place the tattoo drawing face-down onto the gel layer on your skin. Hold it there for a minute with firm pressure, so that the image will transfer. When you’re finished, remove the paper and check the results. Fix any mistakes in the drawing by repeating the aforementioned process.
 Sprinkle baby powder on top of the tattoo, to absorb any leftover moisture and to help it to set. Doing this will make the tattoo last much longer than without; no baby powder means that your temporary tattoo will only last 2-3 days.
 Use a clean tissue to carefully wipe off any gel or powder that might still be on your skin. Be careful not to rub the tattoo too much, until you’re sure that it has set and is completely dry. When you’re done, you can help protect the tattoo for longer by covering it up with a wrap when you’re sleeping.

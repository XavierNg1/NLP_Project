 If you'd like to make bird nests instead, lightly grease the wells of a large muffin or cupcake tin instead.;
, For traditional haystacks, use the butterscotch chips.If you don't like butterscotch, use chocolate chips instead. You can use milk, dark, or semi-sweet chocolate chips.


For extra flavor, try 1½ cups (265 grams) of chocolate/butterscotch chips and 1½ cups (265 grams) peanut butter chips instead., This will help the chips melt more evenly. It will also keep them from scorching.
 You will finish making the haystacks in the saucepan. Plan to work quickly however, as the butterscotch/chocolate chips will set quickly.
 If you can't find any chow mein noodles, or don't like them, you can use pretzel sticks instead. Don't use the regular loop-shaped pretzels. If the pretzel sticks are too long, you can break them in half before adding them to the saucepan.


Do not use cooked chow mein noodles. The noodles must be dry or uncooked.
You can use any type of nut you like, but almonds, cashews, peanuts, pecans, pistachios, or walnuts are the most popular. # Stir everything together gently until the noodles are evenly coated. Use a spatula and a rolling motion to stir. This way, you'll be bringing everything from the bottom of the saucepan to the top. Try hard not to crush the chow mein or pretzels, or your mixture will be too crumbly.
 You will need about 2 teaspoons of mixture per haystack. If you are making bird nests, fill the cupcake wells with the mixture, and make a small dent in the middle of each one using your thumb or the base of a wooden spoon., If you are in a hurry, put them into a freezer for about10 minutes., If you are making bird nests, pop them out of the muffin tins, and place three candy eggs or jelly beans in the middle of each dent.,

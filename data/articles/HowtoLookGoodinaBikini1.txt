 A few days before you plan on wearing a bikini, reduce the amount of carbs and salty foods you take in, such as frozen meals and processed foods. Also, try not to eat gas-producing vegetables such as onions, beans, and broccoli, which may bloat your gut. Instead, try eating cooked spinach, celery, asparagus, and tomatoes, which may actually help you lose water weight because they are diuretics., Keeping your body hydrated will not only make your skin look great, but it will prevent water retention that leads to bloating. Drinking water can stimulate your body to release fluids that will create a thinner appearance. You should be drinking at least eight glasses of water each day to stay hydrated, but more if you are sweating or performing physical activities. If you find it hard to drink plain water all day, liven up your drink with a slice of cucumber, a few blueberries, or a lemon.
 The day before you go swimming, be sure to shave your legs, armpits, and especially your bikini area. Shaving the day before may help prevent stinging if you will be going into a chlorine pool or hot tub. Always shave with shaving cream and a sharp razor that has a moisturizing strip to help prevent razor burn.Opt for a professional to give you a bikini wax a week before you plan to be in a bikini to remove all signs of hair. These treatments can be expensive, but they will keep you hairless for your bikini., Whether you do yoga, go jogging, or lift at the gym, find a way to get your heart pumping. Cardio workouts are one of the best ways to shed the pounds to prep for bathing suit season. Exercising is not only good for the outside of your body, but it is vital for your heart to stay healthy. So find an activity that you love and gets your body moving so you can look and feel your best.

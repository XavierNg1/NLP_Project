 Both cast iron and nonstick skillets are not dishwasher friendly. A cast iron pan may rust in the dishwasher, as it can be stripped of its protective seasoning. While some nonstick skillets can go in the dishwasher, it will wear down the nonstick coating more quickly., Metal utensils can scratch the surface of a nonstick pan. Instead of metal, use plastic, wood, or silicone with your grill pans to help the coating last longer.However, metal is fine to use on cast iron., When washing your grill pan, you may be tempted to reach for steel wool to clean the pan more thoroughly. However, like metal utensils, steel wool can damage the coating on your grill pan, both cast iron and nonstick varieties. Stick to nylon scrubbers., It takes a little time to build up a true seasoning on your cast iron skillets. While you're still building it, don't cook acidic foods like tomatoes or beans in your cast iron skillet. Once you have a good, non-stick surface on your surface, acidic foods are fine., While cast iron grill pans can take high heat, most nonstick grill pans aren't meant to go to high temperatures. If you want to cook something on a high temperature, stick to an outside grill or a cast iron grill pan.,

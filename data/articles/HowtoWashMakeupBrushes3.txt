 Olive oil acts as a gentle cleanser, and it also conditions brushes to help keep the bristles from drying out. It's a great way to clean brushes that are made with natural hairs or fibers. If your brushes are plastic, soap is the better way to go.
 Try to saturate the bristles with olive oil. You can use more olive oil if needed. Swirl the brushes until the residue on the brushes has been transferred to the sponges. Repeat until you can run the brushes over the sponge without leaving a trace of makeup behind.
 This removes excess olive oil. Hold the brushes under the water and rotate them to remove all traces of olive oil. Be careful not to get water into the barrels of the brushes, since this could loosen the glue and cause bristles to fall out.
 Place them on a clean towel and let them dry for a few hours or overnight. Reshape the bristles of brushes that have a special shape. Remember not to use a hair dryer to speed the process along, since this can damage your brushes.

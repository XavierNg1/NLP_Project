 Rewrite them to make sure they are relevant, brief, and succinct, and that they are written in a way that flows well when spoken.;

Speak loudly and clearly so that everyone can understand what you are saying.
Speak slowly. Many people tend to speed up when they get nervous. Keep your cool. Remember, it's only announcements.
If you do make a mistake or miss a word, simply repeat the part you missed. Don't advertise that you made a mistake or make it worse by floundering, or by offering more than a simple "excuse me" by way of apology. Listen to people who speak on the radio. They miss words often enough, but they recover quickly and without dwelling on it.
Use a natural voice or exaggerate your inflection a little bit. Try to avoid reading in a monotone.

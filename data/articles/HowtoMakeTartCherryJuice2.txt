 About 15 is good if you're just making a glass for yourself; use more if you plan on serving to a group. Or if you just want some for later!


The easiest way to clean and de-pit the cherries is to place them in a bowl, run them under cold water, and strain. Then score the cherries vertically, and remove the pit with the edge of a butter knife.
 If you want some serious tartness, stay away from the sugar. Otherwise, start with about 2 tablespoons (30Â ml) -- you can always add more later if you need it.


You can also use a no-calorie sweetener, honey, or agave syrup.
 With no water, your juice will be more like a syrup-y concentrate. Add a bit tablespoon by tablespoon, blending in between. Stop when it reaches the consistency you want.


There will probably be tiny chunks floating around preventing you from having a smooth consistency; this is normal. We'll take care of those in the next step.
 Unless you like your cherry juice particularly pulpy, of course. It's easiest if you have a glass strainer (like one you might use for cocktails) that you can just set over a glass and pour in. This'll remove all the chunks of skin that your blender didn't take care of.


If the result after the straining is still too thick, add a bit more water. Taste it periodically to see if it tastes how you like.
 Et voila! Throw some ice in, a straw, and maybe even a garnish to get fancy. Who needs the stuff from the grocery store when you can whip up your own in jiff?

 They must be experienced in Reach and be very trustworthy. They must each have a mic as well. Once you have a script, be sure each player memorizes their every part.;
, Go to Forge, Custom Games, Firefight, or even Campaign. Try going to Campaign missions that possibly suit your roleplay. You can even use the characters from the Campaign.
 For example, if your character is a sniper try using the scout or air assault armor, rather than grenadier or E.O.D. This will add to the immersion and help with the feel of the roleplay.
 If it's just a little role, it won't have a big impact.
 Every single movement must be correct. Don't fret, mistakes will happen, just reload and try again. Try exchanging roles and try to think as your character, rather than yourself.
 Roam. Move around. Find different areas that could house your roleplay (but find them before you start, preferably).
 Just like a play. When the time comes, look sharp! Once you're done, go STRAIGHT to the Theater and watch the video (in Temporary History). Watch it. Try to find any and ALL mistakes. Retry it if you have some. But little slips, like a guy moves left just a tad, you can ignore.
 Be sure you move around a bit to adjust. You need to see clearly. Try panning the camera.
 If you are confident in it, upload it to your File Share, and let the whole world see!

 Almond extract, vanilla extract, and fruit extracts are simple ways to flavor sugar. Start by adding just two to four drops of extract per cup (240 mL) of sugar, since these flavors are concentrated. Stir thoroughly until the color is even, using a spoon to mash apart clumps of moist sugar.
 Slice a vanilla bean pod lengthwise and scoop out as much of the sticky, inner seed material as you can. Stir or blend this sticky material thoroughly with 2–4 cups (480–960 mL) sugar, depending on how strong a flavor you desire.Add the bean pod itself to the sugar and store in an airtight container. Wait at least 48 hours before using, while the flavor infuses.
 You'd never thought of alcoholic sugar before, but now you're interested. Cocktail bitters usually have a strong flavor, so start with two or three teaspoons (10–15 mL) per cup (240 mL) of sugar, and add more if necessary.
 Freeze-dried fruit can be ground in a spice grinder or coffee grinder, then mixed into sugar by hand.This will also add color to the sugar bowl more than most other flavors.

If your USB drive does not appear, see the Troubleshooting section below.
 If you're using iTunes for your music, you can quickly copy your music to a USB drive using the iTunes program. If you're not using iTunes, the process is the same but you'll need to manually track down your music files in Finder.
 You can transfer any of your songs or albums, but you won't be able to transfer playlists. You can hold ⌘ Command to select multiple files, or ⇧ Shift to select blocks of files.


If you're using Finder, open the folder containing the music you want to transfer, then select the files and folders that you want to copy.
 The files will begin transferring to the USB drive. The original files will not be removed.If you're moving files from Finder, hold ⌥ Option while dragging them to the USB drive. This will leave the original file on your computer and create a copy on the USB drive. This isn't necessary if you're using iTunes.
 This may take a while if you are copying a lot of music files.
 After the transfer is complete, drag the USB drive to the Trash to safely unmount it.
 After dragging the USB drive to the Trash, you can pull the drive out without worrying about corrupt data.

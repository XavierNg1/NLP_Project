 Graphic jersey tunic dresses and short, print A-lines are new Emo staples that are a must for the warmer months. Opt for dark colors with statement-making designs, like a music promo or a checkerboard or skull print., If you love your flannel or plaid, try cutting off the sleeves and/or knotting the front across your belly to make it the length that you want. You can do the same with your favorite T’s or vintage shirts.


You can, of course, always buy new tanks and belly shirts, too. Go for ones with graphics, prints, or quotes that have something to say about who you are.
 If you’d like a two-piece, try a halter top with a full-coverage bottom with low-cut legs. One-pieces with ruching and low-cut legs are also tres chic.Black, red, or pink are generally your best bets, color-wise.
If you’d like a pattern, go for horizontal stripes or polka dots. You could also opt for a statement-making graphic.
One-piece cut-out suits with slashes across the front or holes on each side are also new Emo trends.
For a masculine swimsuit, consider shorts that combine black with bright graphics.
 Beanies or black bowlers are probably not the best option for summer since they’re hot and don’t provide much sun protection. Opt for a straw boater hat to keep the simple, retro feel with a cooler fit and a wider brim. Alternatively, try a floppy sun hat in black or bold pink., Thick-rimmed wayfarers are classic Emo. However, any oversized shades will do the trick. Try black rims with a bold pop of color on the arms.

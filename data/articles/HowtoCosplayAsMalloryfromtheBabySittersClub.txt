 Mallory has shoulder-length, curly, red hair. If you need to, you could use a wig, or get it dyed and have a perm.;
, Planos (faux glasses with dark rims) are good, as are conservative pairs of sunglasses with the lenses taken out.
 This is Mallory's favorite pastime.
 Mallory does not go to extremes to be individual, but neither would she wear anything resembling a school uniform until, in book 126 of the series, she goes to boarding school.


Feel free, however, to wear fall outfits in the spring or vice versa.
 Do not use a diary with lock and key and the dates printed on each page. Mallory thinks that is unnecessary. Instead, use a plain composition book.
, She loves anything to do with horses - clothes, toys, and so on. She has even been known to pretend she is a horse!

, This comes from book 47 in the series.

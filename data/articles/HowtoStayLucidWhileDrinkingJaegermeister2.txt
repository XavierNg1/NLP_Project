 Dry yeast has an enzyme in it that is able to break down alcohol molecules, similar to how your liver metabolizes alcohol. By consuming dry yeast prior to drinking, the enzymes are able to help lessen the effects of alcohol, thus keeping you more lucid.Try mixing the dry yeast into a cup of yogurt to make it more palatable.
You can buy dry yeast at your local grocery store. Fleischmann’s is a great brand.
 Have a big meal before you start drinking. Concentrate on eating a lot of carbs, proteins and fats, as these take longer to digest. If possible, eat a burger or BLT, to help soak up all the alcohol (a sandwich with meat and avocado on it is also a great option.)If there’s food available at the place you’re drinking, try to alternate between eating and drinking. Appetizers and hors d’oeuvres will be your best friend.
If you know you won’t have time to eat prior to drinking, plan ahead and bring a sandwich or protein bar with you.
 The more tired you are, the worse your liver becomes at processing alcohol. That’s why when you’re tired, one drink will sometimes hit you three times as hard. Avoid this pitfall altogether by getting a good night’s sleep the night before you intend to consume a lot of Jager.If you have time, take a nap before going out drinking.
Avoid drinking caffeine while drinking alcohol. It will trick your body into thinking it’s more awake than it actually is, and it’s also a diuretic.

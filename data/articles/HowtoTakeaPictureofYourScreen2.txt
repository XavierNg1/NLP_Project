 Make sure that your screen shows what you wish to take an image of.
 You can capture the image so that it instantly saves to the desktop (usually as a PDF). There are a few methods which each produce slightly different results.Press Command-Shift-3 to capture the entire screen.
Press Command-Shift-4 to capture only a portion of the screen. A crosshair will appear, at which point you can point-click and drag select the portion of your screen which you want captured. It will save when you let go of the mouse. While you are dragging, you can press spacebar to drag the selected area somewhere else, shift to drag one edge at a time, or option to anchor the center and adjust outwards.
Press Command-Shift-4-Spacebar to capture just one window. After pressing Command-Shift-4, hit the spacebar and you will be allowed to click the window you want to capture. It does not need to be fully visible to be captured.
 Any one of the above commands can be made to transfer the image to the clipboard by adding the Control key. For example, Command-Control-Shift-3 will capture the entire screen to the clipboard. At this point the image can then be pasted into your image editing program of choice.

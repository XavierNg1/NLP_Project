 Subframe connectors work to increase the strength of your frame, but this won’t help much if there are weak points due to rust. You should repair any rust spots before installing your subframe connectors.;
, What comes out will depend heavily upon where you are making welds. You should remove any seats, carpet, stereo equipment, etc. that might get too hot and ignite due to your welding underneath it. This helps to prevent fires inside the car while you’re welding.


If you are using the bolt-on only method of installing subframe connectors, this step is not necessary at all.
 This seems simple, but it can be tricky. Your car needs to be as level as possible to minimize body flex. If your car is uneven, it twists and flexes the body. If you then weld the subframe connectors in while the body is twisted, you weld in that distortion and make it permanent. You should use ramps or a drive-on body lift.
 You do NOT want to ignite the fuel line or tank while welding. Do not shortcut this step. If you need to remove the fuel lines and tank do it.

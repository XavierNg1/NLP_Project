 Go to the Den Shop and buy a new Den. It should be just big enough to fit everything that you want to sell. Make sure it is empty.;
, Be sure to put only what you want to sell. This includes shelves, tables and whatever else you may use to showcase your items. Organize your items, or at least place them so they look nice.


Betas are highly sought after in Animal Jam. Players will fight for it.
Try to get items that cannot be found in regular stores in Jamaa. Seasonal items are good to have in stores.
 Go to a busy place like Jamaa Township or any crowded place that Jammers visit often. If possible, make sure there is no other events like another store or fashion show to take your possible customers. Hop, dance or play to get their attention and say that you have a store at your den.
 After a few minutes, say, "Last Calling!" and return to your den. If you advertise for too long, then your customers will get tired of waiting for you and leave.
 When you arrive at your den, there should be a few players there hopping or playing on an item. Many times they will say what they want. Put the wanted item on your trade list and they will try to trade for the item.


Remember, if someone claimed the item first, and another player tries to take it, be fair. Give it to the player who was obviously there first, even if the other player was ready to give you fifty rares.

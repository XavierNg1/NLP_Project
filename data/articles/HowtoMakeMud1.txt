 You'll need sharp sand (also called concrete sand), Portland cement, and water.How much of each will depend on how much mud you need. Both sharp sand and Portland cement should be readily available at your local hardware supply store.;
, Mix the cement and the sand together until they're well blended. Different people will recommend different ratios for mixing (4:1, 5:1, 6:1, and 7:1), but a ratio of 5 parts sand to 1 part cement is the best starting option.


"Stickier", stronger mud should be made using the 4:1 ratio, but this is difficult to mix.
 With the dry ingredients thoroughly mixed add in water slowly until it reaches the right consistency. It should be vaguely damp and stick together when you compress it in your hand.


The consistency will be similar to peanut butter.
What type of sand you use and what the environment is like where you live will affect how much water you need to use. Use less if you know that you live in a wet area.
 Spread your mud as needed for your project. Adjust the ratios if you find they don't work for you.

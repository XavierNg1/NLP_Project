 It's not substituting tofu or soybean for main ingredients, as is the common misconception. Good wholefood is something that remains true to its source. Pick up any food bag and flip it around, read the ingredients. If there are more than six ingredients listed, then you know that you need to keep looking. Six ingredients or less is what you're aiming for.
 There are brick and mortar stores that offers good food for pets. In the United States, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods Market are two such examples. (They're not much more expensive than any other food store either.) Some of this food can be ordered through online stores as well.

Fruitables is an excellent snack food for dogs. They offer salmon, chicken, bison and bacon jerky that is very healthy.
Science Diet, available through pet stores that stock pet food, and most veterinarian offices, is also a good source for both cats and dogs.
 Many people have been taught to never feed a dog or cat something that isn't made just for them. However, dry or canned food simply does not have all of the vitamins, minerals and fiber that a pet needs on a regular basis, especially if they're young and growing. The Collie Club of America published in their books that a puppy's diet can be supplemented with a cup of ground beef to augment their growth.This advice is not limited just to the collie breed. Ground beef, chicken, and ham without any seasonings is perfectly healthy for your pet and is not detrimental to their diet whatsoever.

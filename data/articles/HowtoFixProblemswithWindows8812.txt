 This process is different from completely resetting, because instead of formatting your hard drive, this one will only reinstall windows, thus you will not lose any Documents, Pictures, Videos etc. Do note that you will lose all your programs, besides itself built games like Minecraft, or Steam games, like Five Nights at Freddy's, however, there may be a chance that you will lose the progress. Also, I still suggest making a backup if anything happens.

, Make sure that If your computer is based of a power supply, make sure the power doesn't turn off. If the power tends to go off in your area, I recommend your computer is plugged in an external power supply, that you can find at your nearest Electric shop. If your computer is a laptop/ultrabook/tablet make sure it has 100% battery and is plugged in throughout the process. If your computer fails one of these, it is a very small chance you can get your computer back up and stable without having to pay a fee

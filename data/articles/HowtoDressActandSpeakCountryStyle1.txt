 Country hair for girls can be long or short and worn in a simple ponytail. Country hair for boys can be any style!


Brush your hair every day, no matter how dirty you're going to get in the country. Shower every day and keep good hygiene.
Girls, learn to pull your hair up in a ponytail. Gather all your hair into one until it looks right and twist a ponytail holder over it until the ponytail holds.;
, A good shirt is a button-up shirt with plaid. It can be any color with the plaid style. Orange is highly recommended for girls and boys. Denim jeans with a belt if they are loose are amazing. Belts are only for if your pants are loose or else it will be too tight.
 They look awesome with the outfit in step 2 and are very good for the country style.

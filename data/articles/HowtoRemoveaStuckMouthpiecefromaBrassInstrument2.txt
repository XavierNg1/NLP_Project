 You will need access to very hot running water. Have a towel ready as well, in case the water starts to drip over the instrument too much as youâ€™re working.
 Using a wide rubber band, such as the kind that holds broccoli together, position ice cubes around the mouthpiece. They should touch the insertion point where the mouthpiece goes into the instrument. Let the ice cubes sit against your instrument for a few minutes to get the metal really cold.
 Run the water as close to the mouthpiece insertion point as you can get without melting the ice. As the hot water hits the mouthpipe, it will start to expand the metal slightly, while the cooling effect from the ice cubes will contract the mouthpiece metal. Keep the hot water running for a few minutes.


Don't get the hot water on the lacquered (brass colored) part of the lead pipe. This will cause the lacquer to tarnish or even come off altogether.
 Take the instrument out of the sink. Wrap the rubber band around the mouthpiece as tightly as possible. Grab the mouthpiece firmly, using the rubber band as a sort of grip, and pull the mouthpiece out.
 Dry off your instrument carefully with a soft cloth. After making sure there is no moisture on the outside of your instrument, store it carefully in its case.
 The mouthpiece end that inserts into your instrument should be round and clean. There should be no rust or other debris on it. Look for dents and an oval or squashed shape by holding the mouthpiece at eye level or comparing it to an undamaged mouthpiece.
 If your mouthpiece is misshapen at all, use a trueing tool to return it to its correct shape. This tool looks like a skinny T and has a somewhat pointed end. To use, insert the tool into the end of your mouthpiece. Tap it very gently with a rubber mallet (not a hammer!). The tool will force the mouthpiece end to become rounded.

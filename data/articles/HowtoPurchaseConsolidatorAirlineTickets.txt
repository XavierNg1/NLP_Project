 If price is your number-one priority, booking consolidator airplane tickets can save you money.;
, A travel agent is the best way to purchase tickets from a reputable consolidator. Travel agents who deal with consolidator tickets will have a list of consolidators they work with on a consistent basis so they know who is reputable and who is not. Although they may add a slight mark-up to the ticket, the price you pay will be less than anywhere else you purchase the tickets. Plus, if you have a problem with flight delays or cancellations, you have a person to contact.
, Although many travel sites advertise that they sell wholesale fares, only a few of them actually do. Each of these sites have a large selection of consolidator tickets and they handle the customer service on behalf of the consolidator so you have an advocate in case of a problem. If you use an online consolidator make sure you can contact the company off the Internet, in case of emergencies.

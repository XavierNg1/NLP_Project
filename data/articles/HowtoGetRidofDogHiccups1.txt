 Just as with hiccups in humans, there is no clear way to stop hiccups in dogs. However, some people swear by total relaxation as a way to eliminate hiccups. Put your dog in a comfortable spot and pet it repeatedly until it is calm. Perhaps if it is relaxed enough the hiccups will end.;
, While the underlying cause of hiccups is unknown, some argue that eating quickly, and thus taking in an excessive amount of air when you eat, can increase the likelihood of hiccups. If your dog has a tendency to eat too fast, you can purchase dog feeders designed to slow your dog's eating.There are special dog dishes that make your dog pick up their food one piece of kibble at a time. For example, the “green egg” design with solid plastic flat finger like projections is made specifically to slow a dog's eating down.
If your dog drinks too fast, dishes have been designed with plastic projections that force the dog to lap their water slowly.
Consider using a DIY solution. Find a large rock (baseball sized or larger) that you can scrub clean and place it in the center of your dog's dish to slow the dog’s eating or drinking. Only do this if your dog won’t take the rock out and play with it, as rocks can damage a dog’s teeth.
 For the most part, some hiccuping sessions in dogs are unavoidable. Just remember that the hiccups will eventually run their course without causing any harm to your dog.


Hiccups are especially prevalent in puppies. It is perfectly normal for your puppy to hiccup quite a bit., If you are worried about your dog's lung health, then get the dog checked out by a veterinarian. This way any respiratory illnesses, such as kennel cough or dog influenza, won’t be exacerbated by the hiccuping sessions.

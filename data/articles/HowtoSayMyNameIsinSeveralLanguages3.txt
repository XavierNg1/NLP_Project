 This language has some English roots, so it will be easier for you to pick up potentially. You'll also notice that is spelled with eerie familiarity...


"May naahm ehs"Some people substitute "Ek" for "my." This is more traditional, typically.
 Some dialects of Arabic actually omit the second word, such as Sudanese Arabic.


"Is-mee Ho

, It's just one word, followed but your name.


"Nee-na-nweet-wa."

, Note that Wolof is not a written language, so spelling is not very important. The language is common in Senegal, Gambia, and parts of North Africa."______ la tood"
You can also use "Maa ngi tudd ____" for "my name is." Pronounced "mahn-gee too-doo." Note the extra syllable on "tudd."

, Again, this isn't a commonly written language, so don't worry much about spelling. It is pronounced much like it looks, with the "ngu" the hardest part. Sound it out like "new," but try to get out a gutteral "G" sound right before the word. This is called a "glottal stop," for word nerds out there."Ig-ah-mah la-mee (g)new"

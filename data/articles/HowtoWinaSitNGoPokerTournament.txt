 You should play tighter (play fewer but stronger hands) in early position. In late position you can loosen up and play more hands, because you are last to act. Seeing what the other players have done gives you an advantage. And you'll keep this advantage in later betting rounds.;
, Watch the cards the other players play. Weak tight players will give away chips in the face of raises. Aggressive players will force you to make hard decisions, so stick to premium starting hands against them.
 Change your style and limp (just call the bet) in. Or show a bluff once in a while to confuse your opponents.
 Players tighten up on the bubble, so be aggressive and steal some of the blinds.
 Especially if everyone is folding to you. Stolen pots will build momentum and carry you into the money finishes.
 If there is a player who is short stacked, expect 2 things. First they will go all-in when they have ACE anything or 2 high cards. Second there will be good chance they will be taken out shortly. So play accordingly. Don't take chances against the big stack while there is a short stack soon to be blinded out.
 Beginners usually play the smaller buy-in tournaments. More experienced players will play the bigger buy-in tournaments. Be careful not to blow your bankroll when you move up to the higher stakes.

 A non-stick pan is ideal for reheating chicken â€” especially when the skin has been left on the meat, since the fatty skin tends to stick to heated pans.


You should be able to feel heat emanating off the pan when you place your hand two inches above it.
You don't want the pan to be as hot as you'd use to cook raw chicken, as intense heat will dry the chicken out.
 A little bit of fat in the pan will prevent the chicken from drying out.
 Place the cold chicken in the pan and watch it closely. To prevent burning, move the chicken around the pan so the surface doesn't have a chance to stick to the pan. Make sure to turn the pieces from time to time to heat the chicken through from both sides.
 Give the chicken a minute or two to redistribute its juices, then eat!

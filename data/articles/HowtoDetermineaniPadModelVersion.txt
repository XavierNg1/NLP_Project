 Each iPad has a couple of different variations, typically comprising a Wi-Fi-only version as well as a version that supports both Wi-Fi and cellular data. This is why one iPad type (e.g., an iPad Mini) can have several different model numbers applied to it.

Your iPad's type (according to the model number) does not change the device's physical dimensions (e.g., an iPad Air with cellular is the same size as an equivalent iPad air with Wi-Fi only).;
, The model number is located at the bottom of the back of the iPad's housing, so anything covering this area must be removed., At the very bottom of the iPad's back, you should see a few lines of text; the model number is on the far-right side of the top line of text, right next to "Model".

Your model number will be in A1234 format.

 For example, if you're buying a specific charger or a case for your iPad, knowing the model number will help you determine the size or type of the item., This is the grey app with gears on it that you'll likely find on the Home Screen., You'll see this tab on the left side of the page., It's at the top of the "General" page., The number to the right of the "Version" tag on this page is your iPad's software version (e.g., 10.3.1). The software version determines the appearance and function of your iPad's programs and features.

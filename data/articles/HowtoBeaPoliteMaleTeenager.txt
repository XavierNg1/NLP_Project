 Be positive and pleasant. Begin by asking a question that does not involve yourself. Avoid controversial subjects. Ask a couple more questions to keep the conversation going. If you are at party avoid putting down the host's food, music, etc. You could be talking to the host's sister!;
, Always say "It has been nice or pleasant talking to you. I will call (or speak) to you later." If you leave one message for someone on their phone, don't follow it with another unless it is an emergency.
 It does not matter if it is a man or woman- do not slam the door behind you! Hold the door open for the other person.
, It shows you respect other people. Do not talk during the performance- even if it is very loud.
 Play it safe if you are invited to a nice restaurant bring a suit/dinner jacket. If you are inviting a friend to go with you then find if a jacket is required then tell him.
 Say "No thank you." Do not ask for something else or complain that you don't like it.
 Also show them where the food and drinks are. You want your guests to be relaxed and at ease. Do not try to impress them! If something gets broken then don't make a big deal about it. If you want your guests to leave put all drinks and food away.
 Pull out chairs for any females.
 Always say the name of the oldest person first. Always introduce a man to the woman. It is important to make introductions because if you don't, it is considered rude.
 Take dance lessons or rent DVD's on how to dance. Follow the rhythm of the beat. If a girl/woman asks you to dance never say "no" but you only are obligated to dance one dance with her. Make sure you look directly at your dancing partner, not all over the around the room. Always say "thank you" afterwards., for presents. It is hard to do sometimes but it lets the other person know that you got the gift. E-mails do not count!

 Usually you want to start out with a good bundle of cash before you should start your business.;
, You will usually find a lot of mid level miners in the Dwarven mines who will work for quite cheap.
, This might take a while if you want a good price. If you can't find a buyer who will pay you what you want, you may have to settle for a lower price until you can find a better one.
 Now you have started your mining business! Now, time to form it into an empire! Keep getting more workers working, and keep finding better buyers.

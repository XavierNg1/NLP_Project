 Get your pet to cuddle with you while you take a nap; if the pet escapes, you can always substitute them for a stuffed animal.;
, Is this going to be a power nap because you have work for the day, a cat nap for a few hours, or quality time with your pillow for the entire day? Don't tell yourself that you need to wake up and do something productive instead of sleeping. If you can't sleep, just stay in bed all day!

, The more comfortable you are, the better sleep you'll have. Be sure to count each layer of blanket material as one layer in general.
 This is a day to be lazy, so however you position yourself is up to you. You can have your feet propped up on the sofa's arm rest instead of squishing yourself on the cushions, have a foot planted on the ground if you are in a hammock so you can rock back and forth while going to sleep.
 Ask yourself if you feel more refreshed than before today. Sleep is healthy for people, as it lowers stress and refreshes the body for the next day.

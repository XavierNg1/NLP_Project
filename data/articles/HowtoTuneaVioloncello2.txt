 They are located at the top of the fingerboard, by the scroll. They're a lot harder to use and should only be touched when the cello is badly out of tune. They can either be made of ebony or rosewood., Make sure you have a rough idea of the note you need; the idea is to bring it to around the same pitch, not perfect., Over tune a little bit as, once you let go, it will slide down., If you don't, the note will get even worse in tuning, is less likely to stay in tune and the peg might even fall out. If you're struggling to do this then never be afraid to ask a fellow string player to help you: it's better this than your cello breaking! Once it's in, use the fine tuners so it's exactly the right pitch.

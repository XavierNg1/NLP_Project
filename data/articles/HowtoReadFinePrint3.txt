 When reading fine print that is difficult to understand, a second set of eyes can be very helpful. If possible, ask a close friend or family member to read through the text to see if anything stands out to them. Ask if they reached the same conclusion as you did after reading it.For instance, after having your friend read through the fine print on an internet provider advertisement, ask them if they also understood that there are additional fees for modem rental and installation visits.
 The best way to clarify what is stated in fine print is to speak to a customer service representative from the company to inquire about what is in the fine print. Bring up any questions about terms and conditions that are unclear to you after reading the fine print, and remain clear and cordial. Ask for the individual's name and record the pertinent details of the conversation (e.g. the time and date of the call, the questions you asked and the responses that were given)., The fine print in contracts and legal documents may contain terminology that is difficult to understand without a legal background. If necessary, seek the services of a lawyer to read over the text and interpret it for you with certainty. Search online for lawyers in your area.Some law schools offer free legal clinics for certain types of issues. Contact your local law school, court, or bar association for more information.

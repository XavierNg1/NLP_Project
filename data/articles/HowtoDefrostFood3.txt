, If your microwave does not have a designated defrost mode, set the power to 50 percent. This will prevent the outside layers of your food from cooking while the remainder of your food is still frozen.


Refer to your microwave's manual or consult with the manufacturer to determine how long to defrost your food in the microwave before you can prepare it.
 If you do not cook or eat the food immediately, it will be more susceptible to bacterial growth.


If you have decided not to eat your food after it has been defrosted in the microwave, cook the food, then store it in your freezer to eat at a later date.

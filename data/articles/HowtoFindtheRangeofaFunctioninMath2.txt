 Look for the lowest y-coordinate of the function. Let's say the function reaches its lowest point at -3. This function could also get smaller and smaller infinitely, so that it doesn't have a set lowest point -- just infinity.
 Let's say the highest y-coordinate that the function reaches is 10. This function could also get larger and larger infinitely, so it doesn't have a set highest point -- just infinity.
 This means that the range of the function, or the range of y-coordinates, ranges from -3 to 10. So, -3 ≤ f(x) ≤ 10. That's the range of the function.


But let's say the graph reaches its lowest point at y = -3, but goes upward forever. Then the range is f(x) ≥ -3 and that's it.
Let's say the graph reaches its highest point at 10 but goes downward forever. Then the range is f(x) ≤ 10.

 When you publish a blog article, link to it from your Facebook account to keep your friends and family in the loop. These people may not seem as important for your long-term readership, but who they share it with can have a large impact on your readership.


As your blog grows in popularity, you will most likely see an increase in your Facebook activity, as readers and other bloggers add you as a Facebook friend.
 If you have an image-oriented blog, post the images to PInterest in order to drive your traffic up. Pinterest is very focused on images, so this wonâ€™t be as useful if you have text only.
 Submit your blog posts to StumbleUpon to add them to the bookmark service. Make sure that you tag your article with appropriate tags so that it appears for the right viewers.
 This service may not be as popular as Facebook or Twitter, but because it is run by Google you will get bonuses to your Google search engine ratings when you are linked through Google+. Blog posts on Google+ can also be rapidly shared with a wide variety of people.
 Websites such as Digg and Reddit have millions of active users, and are a great way to spread the word about your blog. If the users like your work, they will do the promotion work for you by voting up your site and commenting on it.
 An RSS feed will automatically push your blog posts to subscribers, and they can access your posts through reader programs. This is a great way to make sure that your subscribers stay as up-to-date as possible.

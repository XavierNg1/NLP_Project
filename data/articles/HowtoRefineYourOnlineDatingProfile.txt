 If you do not have a photo in your profile, add one; many people skip over profiles without photos. Make sure your photo is of good quality and appealing. Try to avoid photos containing other people, or where a person (especially of the opposite sex) is cropped out, leaving a gap or part of their body - this can look tacky. Also, change your photos once in a while - a new photo might catch the attention of someone who skipped over your profile first time.;
, A new headline could catch someone's attention who never noticed your profile before. Try to write something catchy, not the same old line everyone uses - be creative and stand out.
 Keep it short - many people do not have the time to read long profiles. Give people a short teaser of what you are about, and let them contact you to find out more - give them a conversation starter. Let people know what you are looking for, but be flexible about age, height, looks and other details or you might exclude everyone who views your profile. Try not to sound arrogant in your profile - show people what you have to offer, not what you expect from them.
 Having a friend read your profile is a great way to spot problems you may have missed, and get some constructive criticism on things to add. It is especially helpful if your friend is of the sex you are looking to attract - they will know best what appeals to them and what does not.

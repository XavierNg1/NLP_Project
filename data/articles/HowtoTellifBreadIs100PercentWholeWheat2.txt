 Food companies must list their ingredients in descending order of weight. The most prevalent ingredient is always the first item listed. If you are searching for a 100% whole wheat product, the first ingredient listed should be “Whole Wheat Flour,” “100% Whole Wheat Flour,” or “Wholemeal Flour.” No other type of flour should appear in the ingredient list.


Wheat flour, unbleached wheat flour, multigrain, enriched, and stone-ground wheat flour are alternative ways of saying “refined white flour.”, If whole wheat is the second item on the ingredient list, there is a high chance that whole grains account for a majority of the ingredients. However, this is not always the case. When whole wheat is listed second on the ingredient list, the bread may contain between 1% to 49% of the grain.


When in doubt, always choose a product that lists whole wheat first., The only ingredients required to bake delicious bread are flour, water, yeast, salt, and a pinch of sugar. Bread manufacturers add additional ingredients to their bread to enhance their product’s taste, texture, and shelf-life. If you are trying to purchase less-processed bread, shop for items that have a short ingredient list with identifiable ingredients.

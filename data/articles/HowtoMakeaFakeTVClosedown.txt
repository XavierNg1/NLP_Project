 Back in the later half of the 20th century, television channels went to bed at night, and would play a little sequence before it did. An example is showing a clock with the time, a voiceover wishing the viewer(s) a good night, playing the national anthem, showing tomorrow's programs, and then a test picture. The test picture would usually be the coloured bars, or the Indian head. However, there could also be static (also known as snow).;
, If you want your own, then get creative! Put up unique programs (real or fake) on the TV guide. Play the national anthem of your nation if applicable. If you want to make a closedown from the 1990s, then don't put Happy or Work for the music. However, in the end it's your call what you do about it all.
 Film the clock, yourself saying "good night, don't forget to turn off the TV set" etc. If you want an American-styled TV closedown (or sign-off), then state lots of technical jargon. Play the national anthem. Show an advert for a radio station (if the TV channel is related to it). As stated before, it is your choice what you put there.
 This is a good way of getting feedback from others.

 If you have a small problem area, like a mosquito bite or slight sunburn, the antioxidants in old teabags can potentially help you heal faster. The epigallocatechin-3-gallate or ECGC found in tea is also an anti-inflammatory. Polyphenols reduce redness, and tannins and theobromine reduce pain.Apply a wet used teabag to the problem area and let sit until dry to benefit from these particular properties.
If you are not yet satisfied with the results, you can re-wet the teabag and use it again in the exact same way.
Injuries or problem areas for which this is potentially helpful include blisters, razor burn, sunburn, poison ivy, recent injection sites, acne, plantar warts, bruises, cold sores, bug stings or bites and even gums which are still bleeding from a lost baby tooth., The caffeine found in tea can help shrink blood vessels around your eyes, reducing the appearance of dark circles, while the tannins help to improve your circulation. Refrigerate the used teabags for 20 minutes; the cooler temperature of the teabags will help reduce swelling. Make sure they are still damp, but not soaking wet, and apply them to your eyes for 15-20 minutes., Add a couple of lavender, peppermint, or chamomile teabags to a hot foot soak or face-steaming bowl and the antioxidants will soften your skin while the enticing aromas help deal with any problematic odors in the area.You can experience a similar effect over your entire body by adding a couple more of them to an entire bathtub full of hot water.
This can also improve the health of your hair and scalp by way of antioxidants and vitamins, like vitamins C and E.Picking a smell that you particularly enjoy can have aroma-therapeutic effects to boot.

 Catching a dog's behavior simply means rewarding a behavior that the dog already does precisely when you see it happen. If your dog already digs, and you want them to dig on command, reward them when you see them digging. You should try to catch them often, as they might only do the behavior sometimes. This will be easier than trying to teach the dog to dig if they do not dig already, or when they’re not digging.If your dog is clicker-trained, simply use the clicker to catch the behavior., If you catch the behavior multiple times and reward the dog, the dog will begin to associate digging with good things. This will help imprint the trick in the dog's mind., Once you’ve got your dog associating digging with treats, you can pair the behavior with a command such as “dig.” Say "dig" when your dog digs, and give them a treat. Remember to keep the command short, so your dog will have an easier time learning it. You might want to pair the command with a gesture such as making a digging motion with your hands. This will help the dog not to confuse similar sounding commands, such as “sit.”, Once you’ve associated the command with the action. You should hold back on the treat until the dog has performed the command. Don’t repeat the command over and over. Just say it once and wait for the dog to respond. If the dog doesn’t get it, don’t give the dog the treat. Instead go back over the trick, and work on "catching" the behavior., This is perhaps the most important part. Once your dog understands the trick, it’s important to practice it, especially in the beginning. After awhile it will stick with fewer practice sessions. It’s still a good idea to return to old tricks to make sure your dog remembers.

 For example, a problem that says "8 is what percent of 32?" indicates that the 32 is the whole amount and the 8 is the partial. What tips this off: the 8 connects directly to the "is", while the 32 connects directly to the "of".;
, So on the calculator, punch in the partial amount, hit divide, enter the whole, and hit equals.


Example: "8 is what percent of 32?". Take 8, divide by 32, hit equals; get 0.25; convert that to 25%.






Example: "what percent of 25 is 16?". Enter 16, divide by 25, hit equals; get 0.64; convert to 64%.






Example: "what percent of 12 is 45?". Enter 45, divide by 12, hit equals; get 3.75; convert to 375%. (Answers larger than 100%, while rare, are acceptable).






Example: "9 is what percent of 250?". Enter 9, divide by 250, hit equals; get 0.036; convert to 3.6%.

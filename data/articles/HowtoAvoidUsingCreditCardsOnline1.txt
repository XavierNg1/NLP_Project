 Not all merchants offer this option. For those that do, you'll receive a bill in the mail for the goods you've ordered. Once you pay that bill, the goods will be shipped.


This option is sometimes available by phone even if it's not available online. You might need to scout out your wanted purchases online, and then make the final purchase by phone.;

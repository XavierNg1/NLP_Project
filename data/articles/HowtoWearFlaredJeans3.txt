 The flared leg looks very flattering with almost any kind of heel â€“ chunky sandals, clogs, wedges and platforms can all look very polished. Flares already tend to elongate the leg, and wearing heels with them emphasizes that even more. Make sure the bottom hems of your flares are not touching the ground, though, which can take this look from polished to sloppy pretty quickly. If you have to, hem your jeans or have them tailored for the shoes you plan to wear with them.
Avoid wearing pointed-toe shoes with flares, which can look dated.
 High-waisted flares already do a lot to create a soft, feminine silhouette, but you can emphasize this quality even more by wearing them with a thin belt that cinches at the waist. The belt can accentuate your curves while the high waist looks polished and appropriate for almost any occasion. Tuck in a button-down dress shirt and add a thin patent leather belt for an office-ready look.


Tuck a drapey, loose-fitting top into a pair of classic denim flares, then add a belt to create an easygoing vibe with a touch of glamour.
Long trench coats that belt at the waist can also look great, and the longer silhouette provides more balance to your overall look., An eye-catching accessory can add a lot of flair to a neutral colored outfit. This technique also works great with a monotone outfit, like crisp white flares paired with a white button down, because the added scarf or bag really pops against the single-color backdrop. Add a pair of chunky heeled boots to finish off this look.


A clutch with a sleek shape in a bright color like orange can add a lot of flair to a monotone outfit with very little effort.

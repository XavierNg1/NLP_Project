 You may also find Avon representatives selling products on eBay or, if you work in an office, 1 of your coworkers may be an Avon representative and have a catalog available. However, Avon's website can show you all the representatives near you with very little effort on your part.


Click the "Find a Representative" option to access the representative search. A new page will launch.
Select "Recommend a Representative in my area" to find a representative near you. If you already know the name of a representative, keep the option set to "Help me find my current Representative."
Enter your address, city, state and zip code if you are searching for a new representative. Enter the representative's last name and state if you are trying to find a current representative.
Select the desired representative from the list of options. You may have several pages of results. Representatives that have "Personal" listed as the delivery method will hand-deliver your products to you. Representatives that have "Direct Delivery" listed have online stores. Representatives that have both listed offer both options and those with nothing listed may be new representatives and not have their options configured yet.
Click "Contact Me" under the representative's name if you want to talk to the representative before placing the order. You will get a window where you can enter a message for the representative to contact you.
 The representative will collect your payment upon delivery.
 The representative's store is configured exactly like the generic Avon online shop, except the representative's name appears at the top of the page. To order your product, follow the instructions in the section titled "Purchase Directly From Avon."


Select "Direct Delivery" or "Personal" under your delivery options. Direct Delivery will ask for your credit card information. Personal will send the order to the representative and she will deliver the Skin So Soft when it arrives.

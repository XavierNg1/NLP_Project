 This is the easy step. Make sure you choose the appropriate rating. (ie. Don't buy a T rated video game if you're, say, 10.) If you can't find a game, ask a friend to recommend you one. It's best if you and your friend usually play the same games or at least like the same genre.;
, GameStop is a popular video game store. Another would be Toys R' Us and Best Buy. Find the closest one near you.
 As long as you have internet connection, you can shop for inexpensive games right in your own house. Some examples are www.gamestop.com, www.amazon.com www.ebay.com, etc. Online you can also choose preferences, like the price. But also remember you have to pay shipping and handling.
 If a game is new, it may be very expensive. If a game is scratched or damaged, it will cost less. Do not buy those even if the prices are low. If the game is old but expensive that means it was very popular and was good and probably still is. Some old games that were very popular are Fable 2, and Rock Band 1 (There is a Rock Band 2!) Buy the game you want. Enjoy!

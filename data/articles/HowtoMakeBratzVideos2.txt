 What is it about? Maybe: A nerdy girl becoming a popular teen, but she ends up betraying her friends. Or how about twin sisters with a dark secret. It can also be fiction, like about a vampire or mermaids. But of course you'd need fangs and fake blood and a mermaids tail.
 You need to plan! What is season one all about? Whoa- before we step there, let's talk about the title. Be creative. If it's about twins with a secret what about: Pretty Faces, Ugly Hearts or Identical Secrets.
 You may need a doll house with several rooms. It's fun to make the set's props, not buy them! Now the characters. Be sure to remember which doll plays who. You don't want to have a Cloe playing Heather, and then a Jade in the next episode. That only works if she changes looks or something.
 Yes, you can try improv, but it's better to have a game plan. This helps you remember, "I'm on episode twenty, Hanna is about to bite her next victim and she says something funny...". This is optional, but you can also include in the script camera angles, positions, what a character does (like an action), etc.

 If an emergency arises and you do not have a crate or a harness to transport your cat, wrap your cat gently with a towel. Wrapping a nervous cat in a towel can help prevent injury to both you and your cat, as well as help the cat feel safe and secure., On a flat surface, gently place your cat in the middle of the towel, several inches from the top.
 Pull the short end of the towel over the cat’s neck and body, and tug the corner of the towel forward. Tuck the towel corner under the cat’s neck.
 Grab the opposite side of the towel and gently pull it over the cat’s body and tuck it beneath the belly. Make sure that it fits securely but comfortably and that the cat’s head is not covered or restrained., Slowly lift your cat and place him or her an open-top box.

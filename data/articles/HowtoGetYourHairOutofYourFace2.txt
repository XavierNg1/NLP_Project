 Draw back all of the hair from the sides of your face into the ponytail or braid. A braid is often good because it can "knit" stray pieces into it. Some examples include: a ponytail, a French braid, a fishtail braid and a curly ponytail.
 You can use the gel to keep the stray hair stuck down firmly against your head.

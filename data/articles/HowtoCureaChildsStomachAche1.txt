 Dehydration can contribute to tummy troubles. Offer your child some water, and encourage them to drink. You may want to add a bit of fruit (such as watermelon or orange) to the water to make it taste yummy for them., Bland white foods can help absorb any excess acid floating around in your child's tummy. A plain slice of whole wheat bread is an excellent choice, as well as dry crackers or plain rice.It is best to avoid oily foods or dairy.
 Chicken broth (especially broth made from real chicken bones) is a mild, nutritious, and easy-to-digest food. The warm liquid is also soothing. Especially if your child does not want to eat, try offering some chicken broth to help keep them nourished and hydrated.If your child does not eat chicken, you could offer vegetable broth instead.
 You can purchase over-the-counter stomach ache medication made specifically for children. Ask your pharmacist for a recommendation. Provide the correct dosage based on your child's age and weight, and follow any instructions.

Some options include:

Electrolyte drinks (such as Pedialyte) can help with diarrhea or vomiting.
Childrenâ€™s laxatives (such as Pedia-Lax) can help with constipation.

 Now Ninja Classes can be modified to personal preference depending on what purpose they will serve. Here are a few set ups and what purpose they are best for:


Stalker Class:Now if you want to stalk opponent's, play dead or cover objectives defensively from visual cover this class is terrific:

Primary Weapon: Ak74U w/ Suppressor
Secondary Weapon:Ballistic Knife
Equipment:Tactical Insertion (if you want to play dead or use as a flanking tool) or Motion Sensor for setting up a kill box.
Perks: Ghost Pro (because removes name, enemy cross hairs don't turn red when they target you, etc). For perk two it's a choice between either Steady Aim Pro (which reduces wait after knife kills which is extremely useful) or Warlord (grip and suppressor is a useful combo.Sleight Of Hand would be useful for reload also but again you can circumvent it's usefulness.


Class 2: Ballistic Massacre: Now if you plan only using knives then use this class.

Primary: SMG of choice (It's recommend to use either Kiparis Or AK47U)
SecondaryÂ :Ballistic Knife
Equipment: Not really important so choose depending on preference or camera if you wanna have a go with long distance tomahawking.
Perk 1:Lightweight Pro(gives you the speed to close distance quicker which is good for melee kills)
Perk 2:Steady Aim Pro for faster melee kills and hip fire kills.
Perk 3:Ninja/Ninja Pro for silent movement and with pro completely silent.

, If they spot you running one way round a building think and also keep note of any blips on radar or spy plane.Try to do the opposite of what they expect.
 Playing dead is when you hold a tactical insertion in your hand and lie prone. Not entirely 100 percent convincing due to head movements but it can still work. Remember, if possible, use bodies as cover (lie in them) or even Try to do not look around a lot as this just adds more movement and will result in an easy kill.

 In the classroom you should be focused on the lesson, not on your crush. The second you get out of class you can relax a little. Just don't get carried away and be late for your next class.;
, Take notes in class especially when the teacher is verbally reviewing and teaching and they aren't giving out study guides or handouts. Because once that teacher repeats it twice, it usually disappears into thin air and you'll never see or hear it again. (UNTIL YOU GET THE TEST.) So remember to TAKE NOTES!

, When it comes down to that extra point you need to get an "A" you may not realize it, but they look at whether you are respectful and serious about class in addition to if you deserve the extra point.
 Your planner will be the key to organization in high school so make sure you use one. Write down homework assignments, test and quiz dates, fundraisers, school holidays, or whatever you need to remember. If you feel that your planner lacks enough space, try a composition book. You can buy ones with cool designs and prints nowadays and if you are really creative you can buy colored or printed duct tape to cover it, some colored permanent markers to draw designs, and some adorable stickers at a craft store to make your planner, and the rest of your supplies, your own!

, Homework helps you review what you've done in class for that day. To help you study, use index cards. Ant to make studying just a tad more fun, pick up some neon colored ones. They help keep you focused and keep you a little more organized. Lets say you are studying chapter 3 but you have four sections to study. Just make each section a different color and in a quick second you can refer to a certain color to study that section.

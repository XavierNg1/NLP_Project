 It's at https://www.whatsapp.com/. You can download WhatsApp's desktop version from this site.

You will need to have WhatsApp installed on your phone as well in order to log into WhatsApp on the desktop.
 This option is toward the bottom of the webpage., It's on the right side of the page. Clicking this button will prompt the WhatsApp setup file to download, though you may first have to select a download location.

Depending on your computer type, this button will say either "Download for Windows 64-Bit" or "Download for Mac OS X".
 It will likely be in your computer's default "Downloads" folder (e.g., the desktop)., Once it's done, you'll see the WhatsApp icon, which is a white phone on a green background, on your desktop.

A white window with a green illustration will appear while WhatsApp is installing.
 Doing so will launch WhatsApp's login page, which has a black-and-white checkered box (this is a QR code)., If you don't have WhatsApp on your phone yet, you'll need to install it on your iPhone or Android before continuing., Depending on your phone, the path to open the QR scanner will be as follows:


iPhone - Tap Settings in the bottom-right corner of your screen, then tap WhatsApp Web/Desktop near the top of the screen.

Android - Tap â‹®, then tap WhatsApp Web at the top of the menu.
 After a brief moment, WhatsApp will scan the code, which will give your computer permission to log into WhatsApp. You should now be able to use WhatsApp on your computer!

If the QR code has expired, click the arrow in the middle of it to refresh the code.
If the code won't scan, make sure that all of the QR code is displayed on your phone's screen--you may need to increase the distance between your phone and your computer screen.

 A smart way to develop an easy-to-remember password is to combine three small words of significance to you, and make a single password. For example, you can use "mydogspot" or "jimswifejane."


Remember, sheer length is far superior to a shorter but random mix of numbers, letters, and symbols, which will be difficult to remember.;
, Develop a password using the first letters of a sentence or phrase that means something to you - like your national anthem or a slogan you have seen somewhere. "Don't shop for it, Argos it" would become "DsfiAi."

, Choose one letter of the first word and one letter of the second word, and repeating this until you get to the last letter of each word. An example could be:


Say your most important possessions are house & plane

Password: hpoluasnee


, Length can be a huge advantage to memorization. If your typing is fairly accurate, consider large phrases from a book, speech or movie, such as:


"It was a dark and stormy night!"
"My fellow Americans!"
"Houston, we have a problem."
The length can provide security even if special symbols are not used. This can help with sites that prevent the use of symbols.
Make good use of punctuation and capitalization to make a secure pass phrase that complies with common password rules.

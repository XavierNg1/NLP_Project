 In order to avoid future complications, keep telling the truth. Try to avoid overselling your appearance by claiming to look like a celebrity or model.Age may be a sensitive topic for you, but lying about it will do little good. If you are 45, try describing yourself as "mid-40s." Follow it up with other interesting facts about you, for example, "I am in my mid-40s, look mid-30s, love salsa dancing, rock climbing, and tasting new whiskeys."
If you have children, it may be an appropriate time to indicate this. Try, "35-year-old mother of a hilarious 5-year-old."

, Vague descriptions such as "fun-loving" or "cheerful" don't make you stand out as unique. Try to use concrete descriptors or offer examples.If you love traveling, describe where you last went and why you would go back.
If you consider yourself a foodie, why not talk about some of your favorite restaurants, or the great meal you cooked last weekend.
If you are an art lover, talk about the type of art you love or the artist retrospective you attended.
 When describing yourself, concentrate on things you like--both about yourself and about the world.


Offer solid, positive descriptions of your appearance such as "curvy, brown-eyed brunette with great shoulders and even better smile."
A little humor helps you stand out from the crowd. Humor communicates a lot about your personality and can help make you seem more down-to-earth and accessible. For example, "I am 34-years-old, blonde-haired, near-sighted, and dash-happy."

, While you should try to avoid overwhelming people you've just met with strong opinions on politics or religion, discussing the things you value allows them to understand where you come from. If education or family is really important to you, talking or writing about it can give people a much more rounded sense of who you are.

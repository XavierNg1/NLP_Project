 Place the nuts in a non-permeable glass or plastic container. Make sure that the seal is odor-tight when you place the lid on. The container itself must also be both clean and free of moisture.


Since you will be freezing the nuts as you store them, you do not need to do any preliminary freezing to kill off any insect eggs or larvae.
Plastic bags are an acceptable storage medium, but hard plastic or glass containers are better choices. Bags are permeable, so odors can still find their way inside, thereby tainting the taste and quality of the nuts.
 Place your container in a freezer set to 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) or below. Using this storage method, most nuts will stay fresh for one to two years. Some varieties may last longer.


Almonds and chestnuts will usually stay fresh in the freezer for at least one year. Pecans and walnuts can be stored for two years, and pistachios usually last for as many as three years. These time periods apply to nuts stored in their shells as well as nuts that have been shelled before storage.
Both heat and light can make nuts go rancid at a much faster pace. Storing nuts in the freezer reduces exposure to both factors, making this the best possible method for long term storage.

 There are, as in painting and digital imaging, many different venues for marketing your work or talents in sculpture. You will need to learn the techniques and develop your abilities to successfully plan and create sellable works of art in this field, just as you must in the previous media. Here are some examples of professional opportunities in sculpture:


Commissioned pieces. Here again is the old stand by, commissioned work. This is the backbone of sculpture art, since it often involves huge amounts of investment for materials, design and planning, and labor. You will find it very difficult to develop a portfolio of valid work in most disciplines of sculpture, with the exception of ceramics,or if you specialize in small pieces.
Craft type work. This may seem borderline to fine art, or even beyond the recognized borders of the fine art world, but craft shows and galleries all overspecialize in this low cost market. This would include pottery, woodcarving, and found item creations such as metal work. Here are some areas where sales potential exist for this field.

Craft shows. This is the obvious one, and with many communities celebrating various heritage festivals and events, the "booth" concept of art sales is becoming very rewarding to artists who are able to produce large quantities of reasonably priced works.
Juried shows. These are also becoming more common as "craft arts" are becoming more recognize as a legitimate form of art. Prize money from juries shows will not earn an artist a living, but will help him or her build a reputation and give them word of mouth advertising.

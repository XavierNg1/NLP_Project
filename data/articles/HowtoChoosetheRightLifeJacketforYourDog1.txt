 All life jackets are designed for specific weight ranges and will only be effective for dogs who fall within those ranges. Be sure you have an accurate weight for your dog before purchasing a jacket.If you have a dog that you can pick up, you can do this using your home scale. Step on the scale to find your weight, and then step on it holding your dog. Subtract your individual weight from the total of yours and your dog’s to find your dog’s weight.If your dog is too big to pick up, weigh them using a scale designed for dogs at your vet’s office or local pet store.;
, To fit their jacket properly, you need to know your pet’s girths around their rib cage and neck.Circle a string or ribbon from the widest part of their ribs around their back. Mark where the end of the string meets up with the rest; then, measure its length in centimeters and/or inches using a ruler or tape measure.
Use the same process to measure the girth of the base of your dog’s neck, so you can tell how large an opening their life vest will need.
 You need to know the distance between the base of your pet’s neck and the base of their tail to ensure that your canine life jacket provides adequate coverage. Use a tape measure to take this measurement in centimeters and/or inches.

 Grab a cookie sheet and spray it with nonstick cooking spray. If you'd prefer, line a sheet with parchment paper (no muss, no fuss, just throw it away after).
 Chop up your bell pepper(s) and, if applicable, shred the mozzarella. Measure out your ingredients and set aside for swift assembly.


The pepper works best for this recipe if it's in thin slices, not chunks. But any shaped pepper is better than no pepper at all!

, Make sure to stir frequently to cook it evenly, browning it on all sides. Drain away the juices, fat, and set aside.
 Place it on the sprayed cookie sheet and get to work. Starting at the center and working outward, form a 12x8-inch (30 by 20 cm) rectangle by pressing out the dough with your hands.
 Make sure to leave a crust! You want the sauce to within 2 inches of the long sides and 1/2 inch of the short sides. Place the cooked ground beef lengthwise down the center (about 3 inches in width) and to within 1/2 inch of the edges on the short sides. Top with cheese, bell pepper and Italian seasoning -- or whatever whets your appetite.


If you'd like your dough to be braided, leave extra room on the sides.
 See the next section for possible folding methods. Once folded, if you'd like a golden color, whisk up an egg and brush it on the top just before baking. Add on any spices or cheeses for a flavor-y crust.
 If your dough seems a bit overstuffed, be especially careful. Keep an eye on it and flip it halfway through, if necessary.


Remove from the oven and let cool. Slice as you see fit. This recipe should serve 6.

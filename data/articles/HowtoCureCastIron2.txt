Vegetable oils like sunflower, safflower, "light" olive oil and canola are suitable. These oils are ideal because of their chemistry and high smoke point - they will produce the hardest temper. Shortening and lard can also help you successfully cure cast iron. Shortening or lard might work best while curing.



It's important to not warm the cookware so much that it makes it unable to be touched. Warming up your cookware before the application of oil or shortening can make the application easier.



You can do this by placing a bit of oil or shortening onto a cloth or paper towel and rubbing it across the cookware's surface. Be sure to cover all sides of the cookware, including the exterior parts.



The cast iron cookware should look as if all the oil or shortening has been wiped away. In reality, a thin coat will remain on the cookware, and this layer will cure the cookware.

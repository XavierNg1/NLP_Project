 To increase your rowing times, you'll want your motion to be as smooth as possible. Don't jerk your legs back during the drive or throw your weight into your upper body. Try to transition to each stage of the stroke as smoothly as possible., Instead of doing one deep pull to get the wheel started on a rowing machine, you can do three smaller pulls in succession. Grab onto the handles and pull back slightly as if you're doing a partial pull. Then, do another pull that's about half a repetition before doing one full pull. This will get your wheel started and so that you can find your pace faster., The drag setting will increase or decrease the resistance on the machine. If you're having issues because the resistance is too high, you can reduce this setting to make it easier to row. Adjust the drag factor by going into the machine's settings and lowering it.Play around with the settings until you find a drag factor that you feel comfortable with.
 Depending on what kind of rowing machine you're on, there will be different numbers on a display that tells you important details about your workout. Typically this information will include calories, pace, and stroke rate.Keep an eye on the stroke rate so that you know what kind of tempo you're keeping and how fast you're going.

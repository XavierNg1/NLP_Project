 When told the angular frequency of a wave but not the standard frequency of that same wave, the formula to calculate the standard frequency is written as: f = ω / (2π)In this formula, f represents the frequency of the wave and ω represents the angular frequency. As with any mathematical problem, π stands for pi, a mathematical constant.
Example: A particular wave rotates with an angular frequency of 7.17 radians per second. What is the frequency of that wave?

, In order to find the denominator of the equation, you need to double the value of pi, 3.14.


Example: 2 * π = 2 * 3.14 = 6.28

, Divide the angular frequency of the wave, given in radians per second, by 6.28, the doubled value of pi.


Example: f = ω / (2π) = 7.17 / (2 * 3.14) = 7.17 / 6.28 = 1.14

, This final bit of calculation should indicate what the frequency of the wave is. Write your answer in Hertz, Hz, the unit for frequency.


Example: The frequency of this wave is 1.14 Hz.

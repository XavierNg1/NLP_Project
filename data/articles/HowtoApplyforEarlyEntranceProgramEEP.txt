 The ACT is a standardized multiple-choice test in the United States to test competency of high school level students in four areas: mathematics, English, reading, and science. Since February 2005, the ACT also includes an optional writing test. It is extremely important to excel on this test, as this test is used to screen applicants for acceptance into the EEP. To qualify for the EEP, you must score 23 or above on the mathematics section, and 24 or above on the English section.;
,, Go to their official website. For example, the current EEP director listed on the website is Richard Maddox. You may contact him by writing to: Richard Maddox, Program Director, Early Entrance Program, Cal State L.A., call him at (323)343-2287, or email him at eepstaff@cslanet.calstatela.edu.
 Be sure to show enthusiasm in attending and perform at your best.
,, You must pass all tests and do well on all assignments and receive satisfactory evaluation at the end.
 The EEP faculty admission committee will meet to go over all application materials and may invite applicants for a formal interview.
 Make sure you perform well on this interview to convince them you are their ideal candidate.
 The Admission Committee will make decisions by the sixth week of summer and mail notices to all applicants. The possibilities are 1) Immediate invited to join the EEP; 2) Invitation to re-apply; 3) Rejection.
 Again, try to impress them at this meeting; they can still change their decisions at this point. Once final grades from your work as a provisional EEP student are posted, a final review will take place and you will be given a final decision.
 If you are invited to re-apply, you should also decide whether you would like to take that approach.

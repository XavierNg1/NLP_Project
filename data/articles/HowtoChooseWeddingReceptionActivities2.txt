 Cornhole is a great game in which you and a few wedding guests toss a series of beanbags toward a wooden board, the furthest edge of which is raised slightly and has a hole in it large enough to allow a beanbag to pass through it. Whoever gets the most beanbags through the hole at the end of five minutes wins.


If you or one of your friends is particularly creative, you could customize your cornhole board with wedding-related imagery like hearts, marriage rings, or some similar motif., Horseshoes is similar to cornhole. The game involves tossing horseshoes – usually three, four, or five – from one stake toward another. The stakes are usually about 5 yards apart. Your goal when playing against another person is to get more horseshoes than the other person around the stake. Once you and the other person toss your horseshoes toward one stake, walk over to it and toss them back towards the other stake you started from., Croquet is a game in which you and another player (or several other players) use a mallet to hit a ball through a series of wickets (small arches that stick up from the ground). Whoever can get their ball through all the wickets in the fewest number of strikes is the winner. It’s kind of like golf, but without the great distances involved between holes. If you’re hosting an outdoors wedding reception, croquet can be great fun for the whole gang.

 This utility is available in Windows Vista and later. The quickest way to open the Snipping Tool is to press the ⊞ Win key and type "snipping tool". The Snipping Tool allows you to create screenshots of the entire screen, specific windows, or a custom area. You can also perform basic edits with Snipping Tool.
 Click the ▼ next to the "New" button to select the type of screenshot you want to take.
 Depending on the screenshot method you chose, the process for taking the screenshot will vary:


Free-form - Draw the shape of the screenshot you want to take. This mode lets you create a screenshot in any shape you want.
Rectangular - Click and drag to create a rectangle on the screen. Anything inside of this rectangle will be captured in the screenshot.
Windows - Click the window that you want to capture in a screenshot.
Full-screen - The entire display will be instantly captured.
 After the shot is captured, it will be displayed in the Snipping Tool window. You'll be provided basic editing tools, including a Pen and a Highlighter tool.
 Click the Disk button to save the screenshot to your computer. You can also attach directly to an email from the Snipping Tool if you use the Windows Mail program.

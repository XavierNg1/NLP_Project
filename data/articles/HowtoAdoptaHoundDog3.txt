, Once the animal shelter has accepted and approved your application, talk with them about picking up your hound dog. You'll need to schedule a specific time to sign any last paperwork and pick up your dog.


Give yourself plenty of time to finalize the adoption. This is a great chance to ask any questions about your dog or how to care for him.
 Make the transition from the shelter to your home easier for your new dog by bringing along any of its personal things. For example, the shelter may let you take one of its favorite toys. If you'll be in the car for a while, you may want to bring water for the dog or something comfortable for it to lie on.


Consider having a friend or another member of the household come along. They can sit with the dog and keep it relaxed on the drive home.
 Try to bring your hound dog home on a day when you have lots of time to spend with it. You'll need to help your dog get used to its new home and begin house training it. You should also spend some time playing with and becoming familiar with your new pet.If you have other pets, remember to spend time with them too or they may become jealous of the new member of the family.

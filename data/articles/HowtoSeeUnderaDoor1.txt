 The idea is to use the reflection to peer through the bottom of the door. Any reflective surface will do, so long as the reflective surface is clear enough to make out what is happening on the other side of the door.


There are a variety of options, including music CDs or small pocket mirrors. If you use a CD, choose one that you arenâ€™t particularly concerned about. It's easy to scratch the object you are using during this procedure.;
, Take care not to make too much noise or move too suddenly when kneeling. Any loud noises or sudden movements may make your presence noticeable to those on the other side of the door.
 Face the shiny portion up, making sure not to place it halfway through the door's length. If you do so, the item may become noticed.
 Tilt the CD and angle your view as needed to see inside the other room. While you will not be able to see everything, you will be able to see a vast majority of anything on the ground, or close to the ground and far away from the door.Make sure there is plenty of lighting on the other side of the door. It helps if your side of the door is not very bright.

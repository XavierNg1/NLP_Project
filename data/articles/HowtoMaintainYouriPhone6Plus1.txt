 The apps you seldom use not only take up the iPhone space, but also slow down your device. On the home screen, long press on the app until it wobbles, and tap the cross in the right hand corner to delete it.;
, When you check the usage of your phone, you'll find that music, photos and videos are taking up a ton of space - especially photos, which are huge. Before you delete any thing, you'd better backup all of them to iTunes or iCloud, or selectively back up with an iOS content manager.
 Too much cached data in Safari can slow down your iPhone overall. To manually clear it out, tap on Settings > Safari > Clear History/Clear Cookies and Data. Or you can use an iPhone cleaning tool to delete all the junk files like App Crash Logs, Download Temp Files, Photo Caches and more to speed up your iPhone.

 Fold your dupatta lengthwise to create narrow pleats. Then, position and pin your dupatta onto your right shoulder. Lay your pleated lehenga dupatta over your right shoulder so that most of the excess material hangs down in back. The material in front should hang down to your hip.








As you pin the pleated material to your right shoulder, make sure that the pin is not visible. Insert the pin from under your shoulder sleeve.;
, Take the longest end of your lehenga dupatta and bring it to the front. Fold the corner to create a pleat and then tuck it into the front of your skirt, just below your belly button.








Make sure that you tuck in enough fabric to hold the dupatta in place. A few inches should do.
 Pick up the corner of the short end of your dupatta that is hanging down in front of you. Fold the corner to create a pleat and then pin that corner to your left shoulder.
 The material hanging down in front should look like a letter “U,” but you want to pleat the center and pin it to create a “V” shape. Take the top center part of the material and pleat it. Then, pin the pleated material to the center of your top.

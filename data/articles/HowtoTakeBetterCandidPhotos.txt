 Hallways and small rooms bounce light around, which can counter the hardness of the flash. Look for 10-foot ceilings and stand 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2Â m) from the wall behind you.;
, People look relaxed and comfortable when they're engaged in activity - smoking a cigarette, fixing their hair, petting the dog. Anything that keeps their mind off your lens is good.

 The process for this will vary from printer to printer.


If you are connecting your printer via Ethernet, connect the Ethernet port on the printer to an open port on your router or network switch. This is typically all you'll need to do for an Ethernet printer.
If you are connecting a wireless printer, you'll need to use the printer's display screen to connect to your wireless network. You'll need to select your wireless SSID (network name) and enter the password if it is secured. The exact process will vary depending on the printer, so refer to your documentation for exact instructions.;
, Once the printer is installed on the network, you can connect to it from your laptop. These instructions work for all versions of Windows.

Select the "Print & Scan" option from the System Preferences menu.
Click and hold the "+" button at the bottom of the list of installed printers.

 Once the network printer has been added to your operating system, you can print to it just like you would if the printer was connected directly to the laptop. Open the "Print" dialog in any program and select the network printer from the list to print to it.

 A blancher pot, which holds 6 to 8 quarts (6 to 8 quarts) of water and contains a perforated basket for holding food, works best, but any large pot that comes with a lid will also work.
 The water should reach a full rolling boil before you add the vegetables.
 A wire-mesh strainer or cheesecloth bag may also work.
 Make sure that they are completely immersed.
 Boil your vegetables for as long as necessary according to expert recommended boiling times. These times do vary. For instance, asparagus must boil for four minutes, while cut corn needs to water blanch for five minutes.
 By shocking the vegetables with ice water, you halt the cooking process and preserve the color of the vegetables. Keep the vegetables in the cold water for the same amount of time you kept them in boiling water.


The water must be 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 degrees Celsius) or lower.
Use approximately 1 pint (500 milliliters) of water for each pound (450 grams) of vegetables.

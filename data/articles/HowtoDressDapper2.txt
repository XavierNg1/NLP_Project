 First, take out suits and shirts that fit your style but might be too big. Most men buy one size too big.
 Look in your local newspaper coupons, yellow pages and online listings for a local tailor who can adjust your suit coats, pants and shirts to fit you perfectly. If you want to save money, look for an independent tailor, rather than one in a shop, since they are likely to give you a deal for tailoring a lot of clothes.
 If you don’t own a pair of oxfords, wingtips, derby shoes or loafers, buy a pair. Choose leather, weatherproof them and shine them regularly, and they should last you for years.For a sportier look, try military inspired Chukka boots.
Popular brands include Clark’s, Steve Madden and Sperry Top Sider.
Look for a deal on eBay, Amazon or Overstock.
 You can look dapper in jeans, but start with selvedge slim fit jeans in a dark wash. Get them tailored if they come close to touching the ground.
 Look for sales on slim fit suits and Brook’s Brothers, Macy's or even Men’s Warehouse. Some department stores even include tailoring for no extra cost, although you usually have to pay for the service.
 Dapper style is versatile; so that you can wear a vintage blazer with jeans, suit pants, slacks and a shirt. Shop at J Crew or look through vintage and thrift stores to find slim fit blazers or those you can tailor cheaply.
 Trade in your t-shirts for colored, white, plaid, patterned and striped shirts. Look for sales at The Gap, J Crew, Urban Outfitters and department stores, and pick them up whenever you can.


Make sure the shirt sleeves are long enough. When you wear a shirt and a suit coat, approximately one-fourth inch (0.6cm) of your shirt cuff should be showing through the bottom of the coat.

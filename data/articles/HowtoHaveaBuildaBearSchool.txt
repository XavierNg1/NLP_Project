 This will be the area you use for your school. Make sure it's big enough for all the Build-A-Bears you'll be enrolling!;
, Choose items like rulers, pencils, pens, paper, folders and binders. And choose other items you think would be good for school.
 These can be made of small boxes, such as shoe, tissue or food boxes. Cover them with fabric or paper to make them nicer and more uniform. Plain brown paper works well.


For seats, use small boxes or large good containers.
 That way, you don't have moments where you're like, "Where did this bear sit?"

, Plan everything out as you'd do in primary school (high school or nursery).


If you have a friend over or a willing sibling, he or she could be a Teachers assistant

, Tell your bear students everything they should know about the school and what they'll be learning.



Teach them the basics first: Mathematics, English, science and geography and handwriting. Don't just write it for them, get their paw and help them.
After that, have extra lessons, like art P.E ,R.E , I.C.T using Build-a-Bear ville.
You could even teach fashion with clothes, if your bears are genuine Build-a-Bears.
 Let them have toilet breaks when they need.
 If the bears are naughty, stand them in the corner or something so that they learn from their mistakes when they do get punished. Remember to reward them too!


Be a nice teacher. Don't slap them with your ruler or anything like that!

, When you have been running your school for quite some time, and your pupils are more capable of learning, give them reading books and homework. You can even have them sit exams and award them certificates that you've made.
 If you have a sibling or friend helping it may be easier to do so.
 And don't teach them the same thing as they may become bored.

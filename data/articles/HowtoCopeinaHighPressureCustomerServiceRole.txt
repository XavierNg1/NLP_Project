 Most stressful situations in customer service jobs are caused by dissatisfied customers. Getting angry will not help. Be polite, tell the customer you understand why they are unhappy and always end the call with a positive solution.


If you need to call the customer back, do so in a timely fashion. Make it clear to the customer that you will respond by a committed time.
If you cannot deal with a query, pass it to a supervisor.;
, Some employers set targets for their staff and you may find that the deadlines put you under pressure. Deal with this by breaking your target into smaller chunks--for instance, if you have to deal with 80 calls each day, work out how many you need to get through per hour.
 Some people will spend their working day complaining about the job, and this can affect your own morale.
 At the end of the day, write down anything that you need to deal with the next day and then forget about it.

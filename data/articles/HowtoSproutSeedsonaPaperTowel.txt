 If you have smaller paper towels, you can skip this step.;
, You can get the best dampness by fully dipping the towel in water, then ring it out completely, being careful not to tear the fragile towel. Once most of the water is out, carefully open the towel all the way, taking care to prevent tears. Lay the towel on a flat surface.
 Place seeds on a center of the paper towel. You can add more or less, depending on the size of your planting area. Just keep the seeds towards the middle of the towel.
 To make sure the seeds stay in place and do not slip out of the paper towel, fold the towel in half once and then fold it in thirds, keeping the seeds in the center panel of the tri-fold.
 You can mark the plastic baggie with the seed name, date, and the estimated length of time the seeds will take to germinate (DTG). You can choose whether or not that would be useful for you. Then, carefully place damp paper towel with seeds into the plastic baggie.
 This is fairly easy to do in any regular house with central heat. If your circumstances are different, you can put the baggie on top of something that stays at a regular comfortably warm temperature. Make sure it's not hot! Some people choose the top of a refrigerator or even on top of a heating pad on the lowest setting.
 Check your seeds daily to make sure they keep damp. If they dry out, just add a tiny bit more water to your bag.
 If you are good at scheduling your time and will remember to check your seeds at the approximate date of germination, then you can come back around germination time. A daily checking may be needed.
 Your seeds have sprouted! Now you can plant in your desired growing pot or plot.

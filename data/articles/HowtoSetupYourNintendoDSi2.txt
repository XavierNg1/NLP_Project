If you hit, Search for an Access Point and it will search for a Wi-fi access point. You should do this option if you have a Wireless Router located in your home. AOSS is a method of security that automatically configures the SSID and WEP key for wireless routers made by Buffalo Technology and a wireless device connecting to it. Manual setup is where you set up your Wi-fi connect manually where you have your SSID, your Security, where you can set your WEP code to protect it, the option to Auto-Obtain your IP Address, Auto-Obtain DNS, and MTU value. The Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector option is where your have that USB connector to connect it to your computer. You can't get this in a store anymore because they has discontinued it. You have a good chance of finding one on Ebay. Advanced Settings is just like Connections 1-3 except that is allows the use of high-security proxy settings.

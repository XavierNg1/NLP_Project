 Teach your students how to read the labels. Show them how to match the book's label to the bin's label and to always return their books to the correct bins. Over time students will warn you when a book is in the wrong bin.


If you are working with young children that still struggle with the order of letters in the alphabet, you might label the bins “FICTION / A – B – C – D – E – F” rather than “FICTION / A-F.” The children will be able to match the letter on the book spine label to one of the letters on the bin label.
 Choose a few books to display on top of the shelves or on a special rack. An entire library of books to choose from can be intimidating for some children. Keeping a few select books out in the open will encourage them to read more.Highlight books on topics you're teaching in class at the moment.
When you add books to the library, display them prominently and identify them as “new.”

, If you allow your students to take books home, be sure to keep track of them. It's easy for a library book to get mixed in with a kid's other books at home. You may need to remind children once a week or so to return any books they have at home.


Keep a pad of paper on a clip board in the library. When a child “checks out” a book, write their name down along with the date, the name of the book, and the information on the book's shelving label.
Cross out the entry when the book is returned, and note the return date. You might also record your initials if more than one teacher or adult will using the library.
If a book has been at a particular child's home for a long period of time, send a note home to the parents asking them to return it.

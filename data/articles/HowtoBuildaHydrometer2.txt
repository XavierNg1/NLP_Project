 of salt to the water. Stir the water to ensure the salt dissolves completely.


If you're doing this experiment in a home school setting and don't have a scale to measure out 1 g of salt, you can instead measure the salt by volume. One gram of salt takes up 0.89 ml (0.18 tsp.) volume, so you can get by using 1/4 tsp. of salt in place of 1 g.
 Note the level to which the hydrometer floats.


If you marked your hydrometer with measurement lines above and below the zero line, write down the measurement of the line which now floats at the water's surface.
If you didn't mark your hydrometer with measurement lines, mark a line at the point on your hydrometer that now floats on the water's surface. (You can also mark this point if you did mark your hydrometer with measurement lines by using a different color marker than those used to make your measurement lines.)

, Add the same amount of salt each time, repeating the above steps and recording the level to which the hydrometer now floats.

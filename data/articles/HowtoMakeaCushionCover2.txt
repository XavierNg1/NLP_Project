 Instead of throwing it away, make it into a cushion cover that you can enjoy every day.
 Lay the t-shirt out flat and then carefully make a cut from the armpits up to the top of the sleeve, following the line of the side of the shirt up to the top. Then make a cut across the top of the shirt, from the top of one sleeve, across the neck, to the top of the other sleeve.


Discard the arms and neck area you cut off. The piece of the t-shirt you keep will be shaped like a rectangle.
 Be sure that the space between the two side seams is the same width as your cushion.



If you prefer, you can stuff your t-shirt cushion cover with cotton wool, wool, or thin sheets of cotton, instead of a pre-made cushion.
 The goal here is to adjust the length of the t-shirt so that it is just long enough to cover up the bottom edge of the cushion.


Pin the bottom edge of the front and back of the t-shirt together. This will form the bottom seam of the cushion cover.
 Use a whipstitch or slip stitch to close up the seam.


You can use your sewing machine to sew the seam as close to the bottom edge as possible, but it could make a slightly awkward edge if you are not experienced at sewing.
 You can be as creative as you like. Sew buttons, beads, or little threads of yarn to the top. As long as you like it, it is perfect.


Another decoration idea for the more patient or experienced sewer is to embroider a small picture onto the front. This will make a nice centerpiece on your cushion cover.

 If she ever glances at you, give her a wink.
 If she tells a joke or asks you a touchy question, give a suggestive, maybe even a little mischievous smile. This one can be VERY effective.
 If you have the opportunity and it feels natural and not weird or forced, give her a hug. Make sure you hold it just a little longer than usual - don't wait till she's trying to peel you off her.
 If she puts her hand on the table or desk, and you're nearby, reach for the nearest object to her hand and intentionally brush your hand up against her hand, and hover for a second before blushing and grabbing the object. Watch her reaction carefully.

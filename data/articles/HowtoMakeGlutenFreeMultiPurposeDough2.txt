 Dump your 113.3 grams (1 cup) of white rice flour, 35.4 grams (1/4 cup) of sweet rice flour, and 2.8 grams (1/2 teaspoon) salt in a large mixing bowl. Use a whisk to mix the dry ingredients together until well incorporated.You could also use a sifter to sift the flour together.
 In a food processor or electric mixer pulse the 113.3 grams (1 stick) of butter, 70.9 grams (1/3 cup) of granulated sugar, and 10 ml (2 teaspoons) of vanilla extract together. Continue to do this for about fifteen seconds or until all of the butter has softened and mixed with the sugar and vanilla.Let your butter sit at room temperature to soften it initially.
 In small batches, slowly add your dry ingredients into the food processor and set it to medium. Allow some of the flour to incorporate with the wet ingredients, then add more of your flour mixture. Continue to dump the flour mixture until all of it is in your food processor., Stop pulsing and scrape the dough that gets stuck on the sides of your food processor. Reattach the mixture to the processor and continue mixing it together until it forms a sticky dough.If your dough is too crumbly for your liking, you can add one egg to the mixture to make the dough more malleable.
 Remove your dough from the food processor and knead it with your hands. If the dough is too sticky, you can use some more rice flour so that it's easier to knead. If the dough is too crumbly, try adding a bit of water to make it smoother., Form the dough into a ball before putting it into a bowl covered with plastic wrap. Chilling the dough will allow it to set and harden, making it easier to work with when you decide to make your pastries.This sweet dough should stay good for 3-5 days refrigerated and covered.
Your cookie dough is bad when it begins to darken in color and smells rancid.

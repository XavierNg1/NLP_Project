 When you have the right mix, you are done with the first part.;
, Now you add a 2 digit number that means something to you and a special character. Let's say it became RdSx77&.
 Now let's deal with the problem of having one different password for each service. You can add, let's say, the first 2 letters of the service you are using, the first in the beginning of the password, and the second in the end. If you want to log in Yahoo, you would use the y in the beginning and the a in the end, so the final password would be yRdSx77&a, which is very hard to guess.

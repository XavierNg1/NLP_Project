 Be aware of the people or cars that are around you. If you notice the same car or person several times, they might be following you. Pay specific attention to:


Cars that appear to stop and start at the same pace as you.
Cars that make several of the same turns that you make.
People who get on and off mass transit at the same time as you.
Customers in a business who seem to be killing time and then leave when you leave.
Runners or others on the street who seem to stretch when you stop and walk/run when you walk or run., If you suspect you’re being followed, you should cross the street immediately. You can do this in a car or on foot. Ultimately, crossing the street will give you an idea of whether the person is actually following you.Take another turn, if the person followed you on the last turn. If they turn again, they’re likely following you.
 Breathe deeply and avoid panicking. Tell yourself that you need to think rationally to safely get out of your situation. If you must, count slowly to 10 in your head. Panicking may result in you making rash decisions that could get you into further trouble.

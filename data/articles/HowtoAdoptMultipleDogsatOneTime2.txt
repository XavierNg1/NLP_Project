 One of the few occasions under which a shelter or rescue may let you adopt multiple dogs is if they are a bonded pair. This means that the dogs have become closely bonded and separating them would cause significant mental anguish for at least one of the animals, resulting in severe behavioral issues. Shelters will often advertise bonded pairs, preferring to keep them together.You can check online or call your local shelters rescue groups to find out if they have any bonded pairs.


A bonded pair usually consists of an alpha and a beta dog. Individually, alphas can often be placed in a new home with little problem. However, betas can struggle with the separation and experience behavioral problems.
 After narrowing your search down to a few pairs that you are interested in, you should visit the dogs at the kennel. Take them for a short walk and play with them. This will help you get a feel for their personalities and determine whether they will be a good fit.Be sure to bring along your family members or any additional pets that you own to make sure that everyone will get along nicely.
 Be sure to talk with the staff of the shelter or rescue group about the pair’s history and their temperament. It is important to know if the dogs suffered any trauma or abuse in their previous home. You should also talk with the pair’s previous veterinarian to determine if there are any health problems that you should know about. .Ask the staff things like “How does the pair behave when separated?” and “How long have these two dogs been together?”
Ask the veterinarian questions like “Are the dogs up-to-date on their vaccinations?” and “Does either dog have any major health problems?”

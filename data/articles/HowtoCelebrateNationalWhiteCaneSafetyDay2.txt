 The model White Cane Law has been codified into law in some form in every U.S. state. However, not every state requires drivers to stop or yield for pedestrians carrying a white cane, which was the initial goal of the law, and reflects the most tangible utility of carrying a white cane. For instance, some states do not grant any special protection to pedestrians carrying white canes. .


Check the American Council of the Blind’s website to read the language that describes driver and pedestrian rights and responsibilities in your area., If your state is lacking in lacking in significant measures to ensure the safety and equality of the blind and visually impaired, you may wish to lend support for the appropriate legislative changes.For instance, you could write a letter to your legislator outlining the parameters of the Model White Cane Bill, and your desire to see the law in your area better reflect that model.
The National Federation of the Blind has drafted a White Cane Safety Day Proclamation you could use as a guide to guide your letter or conversation with your representative. Your legislator may even wish to use this guide for their own proclamation. , Aside from legal and political advocacy, consider getting trained to help people learn to use a white cane. More specifically, you can be trained to help people learn to travel on their own and keep their orientation within different environments. In order to do so, of course, you must experience what it’s like to walk without vision.Training to become an M&O specialist requires 120 hours of walking while blindfolded. The two-year certification process ensures that you are familiar with the experience of walking without relying on sight.
To begin the training process, contact a school for the blind in your state. They will be able to provide you with a list of institutions that offer the training.

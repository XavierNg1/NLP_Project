 Weaning is easier when you let your baby lead the way. That is, many babies will start to become more interested in eating solid foods. Others may grow restless as they turn into toddlers. As your baby starts to lose interest, it's a good time to work on weaning.However, if your baby suddenly starts refusing your breast, particularly if you have a baby under 6 months, something else could be wrong. Your baby could be sick, for instance, or they could be teething. Your baby may also refuse breast milk because you've change your diet, shampoo, or soap, as well as if you've just started your period.
If your baby is refusing, try offering them breast milk when they're sleepy. Also, call your doctor to ask for advice., As you stop breastfeeding, you'll likely need to transition to a bottle. One way to help transition is to put a little bit of breast milk on the nipple before you give them the bottle. You can also put some breast milk in the baby's mouth. Start the baby on a bottle with breast milk when they're hungry but not so much that they are screaming and crying.If your child is a bit older (over 6 months, at least) and showing interest in cups, you may be able to transition directly from breastfeeding to a sippy cup.
 Your baby is going to need help adjusting to the new routine. Playing games, introducing new foods, and enjoying time together can be a way to distract your baby during typical breastfeeding times., If your baby is crying to be breastfed, it's best to feed them. If you say "no," you may find it even harder to wean your child. Instead, try to avoid sitting in the typical places you breastfeed when you don't want to breastfeed. If you sit in your usual places, your child will expect you to breastfeed., Sometimes, your child is just not ready to be weaned. If they're sick or been through a big adjustment, breastfeeding provides comfort that they need. If your child is struggling, try again in a week or two.

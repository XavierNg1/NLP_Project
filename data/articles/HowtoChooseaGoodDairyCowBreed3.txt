 Only female cattle—cows—produce milk, and only after they deliver a calf. You can choose a female cow in any stage of the reproductive process. The most expensive choice will be a young, high-producing cow. The cheapest will be a calf, but you have to feed it and raise it for a couple of years.Your options include:


A mature cow who has already calved.
A pregnant cow.
A heifer who will soon calve.
A calf (and raise it).
 When it comes time to purchase your cow, you essentially have two options: a private sale or an auction house. Whereas an auction house will sell only culled or slaughter animals, private sales will vary from seller to seller.

 If you feel yourself getting upset, put your puppy in its crate or a basket and take some time for yourself. The energy of a young puppy can be overwhelming, as can the messes that it makes. If you feel overwhelmed and that you are going to lose your temper, remove yourself from the situation and chill out.Go for a walk outside or practice some meditation. Find an activity to help you calm down.;
, If you need to take a break from your puppy, take a few deep breaths to help you calm down. Breathe in and fill your lungs with air, and then slowly release it. Do this a few more times, focusing on each breath, and try not to think about your puppy. After a few moments of deep breathing, you should feel calmer.You can also do this in the moment to help you from immediately blowing up on your dog. If you feel the tension rising, take some deep breaths.
 As you are practicing your deep breathing, you might also consider counting to ten. This will help distract your mind from being irritated with your puppy. Focus on the each number and breath deeply. This will help keep you from yelling at your young dog.If you practice meditation, you might also consider repeating a mantra. Your mantra can be a special word like “peace” or “calm.” It can also be a sound like “ohm” or “hmm.”

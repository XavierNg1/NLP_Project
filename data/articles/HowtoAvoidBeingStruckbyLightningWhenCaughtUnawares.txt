 If you are nowhere near the usual buildings of a city, town, or national park offices, you need to find alternative shelter immediately.;
, (FYI, it's a myth that the tires prevent a car from being struck - lightning can easily overcome the electrical resistance of rubber tires!!!). If you are outside, touching the metal and a lightning bolt strikes the car, you will probably die from electrocution, so be aware.






Building of some type (e.g., back country hut, shack, shed, ruins etc.) - if you are in a building of any sort, do not use any electric appliances just in case if lightning strikes your house or a nearby power line, you could be shocked. If the building is in ruins, crouch down low as there may be nothing above to protect you.
 Get down as low as you can and keep down. Avoid being near high objects that will attract the lightning.
 Since trees are positive charged, and the lightning is negative charged, the tree will probably be struck. Lightning always seeks the highest object.
 When you are crouched in the ditch, stay there until the storm has completely passed your area.
 Wait 30 more minutes since at the last strike time, as lightning strikes are still possible. If you feel your hair stand on end, that means that lightning strikes are possible again, and you should probably return to your shelter.

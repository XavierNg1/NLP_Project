 A quick way to ruin comfort and confidence is to compare yourself with others. Try to remember that every body is unique, and everyone else wearing a swimsuit is probably experiencing insecurity, too. Celebrate the differences instead of admiring one, specific type of body., You are probably wearing a swimsuit to go to a pool, beach, or lake. Don’t let discomfort ruin your experience. Remember that you are there first and foremost to enjoy yourself and the company of others., Nobody is as critical of your body as you are. Almost everyone exaggerates their physical flaws. You may be the only one who notices what you perceive as an imperfection., There is most likely no reason for anyone to say anything hurtful you. If someone does say something negative about you, do your best to not let it get to you.Return their negativity with a compliment. If someone says that you don’t look good in the swimsuit you’re wearing, respond by complimenting his or her, accessories, item of clothing, or hair.
Let them know that what they said is hurtful and change the subject. Tell the person that insulted you that you don’t appreciate the inappropriate behavior, and move on by commenting on the occasion or your surroundings.
Ignore the comment and continue talking to your friends. Act as if you didn’t hear what was said and talk to your friends about a subject that is unrelated to the negative comment.
 Staying comfortable might be going well at first, but insecurities may start coming to mind as time passes in your swimsuit. If that happens, take a few minutes to return to your meditation. Recall what you like about yourself, why you’re there, and that you should be happy.
 Be confident despite your anxieties. Nothing is sexier than being confident with yourself if you make peace with your body. It’s easier said than done, but it is possible with perseverance.

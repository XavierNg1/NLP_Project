 In order to dissolve the Dead Sea salt, you want to work with warm water. You can purchase distilled water, or you can boil regular water. Pour your water into a pan, and bring the water to a boil. After reaching a boil, you can turn the heat off. Pour the water into a measuring cup, measuring out one cup (237 mL) for this recipe.
 Measure out one tablespoon, or about 15 mL, of your salt. Add it to the warm water. Using a spoon, stir the water thoroughly until all of your salt has dissolved. If you like, you can also add a few drops of an essential oil, like lavender, to add a nice scent to your mist., You can purchase empty spray bottles at pharmacies and beauty supply stores. If youâ€™d rather not purchase one, you can save an empty spray bottle and clean it extremely thoroughly instead. Pour your salt water into the spray bottle, closing the lid tightly., The benefits of Dead Sea salt are typically found in bath soaks or body scrubs, but creating a mist will allow you to receive benefits throughout the day. Spraying it onto your face in a light mist can hydrate and nourish your skin. Not only can it help dry skin, it can also help to heal acne. Throw it in your bag, and use this mist as a little skin pick-me-up throughout your day.

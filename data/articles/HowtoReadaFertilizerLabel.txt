 N-P-K (Nitrogen- Phosphorus- Potassium) are the 3 most abundant ingredients listed on EVERY fertilizer label. They are always in this order, N-P-K. You will see them on the label as three numbers. Such as: 30-10-10 / 10-5-5 / 21-0-0 But what does it mean and how do you know which formula you need? The first example, 30-10-10, means that if you had 100 pounds of that fertilizer there would be 30 pounds of available nitrogen, 10 pounds of available phosphorus and 10 pounds of available potassium (potash). The remaining 50 pounds are inert or inactive ingredients.;
, Nitrogen is for green and growth. Phosphorus and Potassium for fruit, flower and roots. To turn a lawn green and get it growing, 21-0-0 is the fastest and cheapest way to go. That is Sulphate of Ammonia. However, to promote a healthy lawn that is more drought-tolerant, you would want the roots to be well developed also. A general purpose lawn fertilizer such as 10-6-4 would be a far better diet to achieve a truly healthy lawn.
 Check several sources. Compare notes on what different experts recommend for the type of plants you are growing. When making fertilizer purchases your knowledge of N-P-K percentages will aid in your decisions. Nitrogen = Green/Growth. Phosphorus and Potassium = Fruit/Flower/Roots.

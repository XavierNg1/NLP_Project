 A player must be able to activate it, so an iron or gold pressure plate will not work.
 If you use wood doors, it is very easy to break and your trap will only last a few seconds. Unless the person trapped has a pickaxe, it could take a while to get out.
 If you are unable to get obsidian, use another hard to break item, bedrock would be ideal if you could get access to it, but obsidian is the easiest.
 Once they step on the plate, the doors will close and they will be stuck inside. Since the only way to press the button again is to step off the block and back on it, since they cannot jump up or go forward, the doors will remain closed indefinitely.

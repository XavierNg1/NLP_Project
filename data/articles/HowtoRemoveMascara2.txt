 There are tons of options for makeup removers, so try narrowing down the choices by what works best for your skin. If you have oily skin or break out often, look for something oil-free. If you have very sensitive skin, you'll want a gentle, fragrance-free remover.If you have sensitive eyes, try to find out the pH of your makeup remover. A pH that is similar to your natural tears (between 6.9 and 7.5) will be less likely to irritate your eyes.Oil is a necessary ingredient when you're trying to remove waterproof mascara, because it dissolves the oils in the makeup (instead of being repelled, like water).
Dual-phase cleansers are good for everyday use, blending an oil cleanser with soothing water. Just make sure you shake the bottle first.Cleansing water works well on sensitive skin and regular, non-waterproof mascara., It's best to stick to an actual eye make up remover, since it's specifically made to be used around your eyes, but baby shampoo is an effective replacement if you run out.Use a chemical and fragrance-free baby shampoo if you can. Many "no tears" formulas actually have a numbing agent, which will only mask the irritating effects., Try not to use these too often, as they can be rough on the thin skin around your eyes. If the wipes are not specifically for eyes, look for a brand that is alcohol-free., Petroleum jelly is a byproduct of gasoline, and unless you know the brand you're using has been thoroughly refined and purified (Vaseline is one such brand), it's not something you want near your eyes.Petroleum jelly does not actively hydrate your skin. If your skin is clean and moisturized it can seal the moisture in and keep it from evaporating, but it is not a replacement for moisturizer itself.

 Identify someone who has good credit to co-sign for you. Ask your family first.


Your co-singer should check their credit score before you apply. They can get their credit score for free or for a small fee., You should sign up for the plan yourself. Visit a cell phone store or the carrier’s website. The carrier will run a credit check and let you know whether or not you need someone to co-sign on the contract.
 Stay on top of your payments, and use your cell phone responsibly. The co-signer is responsible for your bills if you don’t make payment, so don’t take advantage of them by forgetting to pay.Automate your payments to make things easier. If you use online banking, automating payments is easy.
 Once you have established a solid payment history, the cell phone provider might move the account solely into your name. For example, T-Mobile might move your account after 60 days.However, the carrier will probably run a credit check when you request that the account be moved. Because of this, you should check your credit before making the request.

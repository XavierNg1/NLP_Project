 During winter or on cold days, all windows and doors that lead outdoors should be kept shut, except those crucial for some ventilation.;
, Use rugs or runners to line pews. Have the ladies' group knit or sew such items as a defined project. This can become quite an honor for those involved in creating the pew wear.
 To prevent knees on cold floors, use kneeling cushions. Tapestry covered cushions are ideal, but other less labor intensive versions will also do.
 This will help to stop damp from rising.
 Ask members of the congregation to fill the church from the front to back. That way, if there are not a lot of people at any one time, they are at least at the front near the priest and they are generating warmth together.
 These can be obtained for a minimal cost and many are very energy-efficient. They can be switched on when the congregation is in attendance and they can be switched off at the close of service. Only those near people need be used to reduce heating costs.
 There are many different fundraisers you could think of with the purpose of heating the church.
 Fill gaps under doors and around windows. Seal cracks in the ceiling. Shut doors leading to internal rooms as well as these will only draw away the heat. Shut extra vents (not a majority of vents so the back pressure doesn't hurt the heater) in the back of the church on weeks there is no one to sit there there. Install ceiling fans to blow hot air down and mix it in rather than allowing it to accumulate at the roof and transfer heat out at a high rate near the ceiling.
 This volunteer labor will reduce costs and will also raise ideas among the members of the congregation.

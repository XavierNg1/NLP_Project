 Mix until mixture has a thick consistency, like very thick porridge.


Ensure that the mix is not too watery. In that case, add a little more onion, cheese and soup mix.
Use a wooden mixing spoon. Use it to mix firmly and break bits of cheese.
Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius. Between 150-200 is ok.;
, Make sure they are put on a flat, clean surface and are evenly spread out.
 Using a tablespoon is convenient. Spread out the mix once placed on the bread using the back of the spoon.


Add little by little to ensure each roll has enough filling each.
Avoid spreading right to the edges as it may melt and spill while cooking.
 Press firmly.


Use a toothpick to keep the rolls in shape. Stab it inside, close to the top.
 This allows the bread to come out crispy and tasty.


Avoid using excessive butter.
 Position each roll evenly on the paper.


Make sure the oven is preheated.
Double check to see if everything is in order.
 Use oven mitts or a towel.


Lift the tray into the top shelf, preferably.
Position it right in the middle for the best results.
 Check every minute or so for progress.


Remove from the oven once the bread looks perfectly browned and any straying cheese is cooked.
Allow to cool.
 Remove the toothpicks.

Storing the rolls can be done, but the product will not have its original flavour and texture.

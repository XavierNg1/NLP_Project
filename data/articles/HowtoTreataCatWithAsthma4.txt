 Cats develop asthma when they inhale something from the environment that irritates their airways. It’s probably not practical for you to identify every single substance your cat could be allergic to. However, you can look for a few substances that could trigger your cat’s asthma:Perfume or cologne.
Scented laundry detergent.
Cigarette smoke.
Carpet freshener.
Hairspray.
Dust.
 If you know what allergens trigger your cat’s asthma, you can take steps to reduce your cat’s exposure to those allergens. For example, if dust is a trigger, put dust-free litter in your cat’s litter box.No cat litters are 100% dust-free. However, some brands of litter (Nature’s Miracle, Tidy Cat Pure Nature) contain minimal dust.Cats don’t always like change, so don’t switch litter types too quickly. Incorporate a little bit of the new litter into the old litter, then slowly increase the amount of new litter until that’s the only litter in the litter box.
 Air filters trap particles in the air that could trigger your cat’s asthma. Replacing them regularly, according to the product label instructions, will help lower the amount of asthma-inducing particles in the air in your home., Vacuuming your home will help keep dust and mold spores out of the air.Daily vacuuming could quickly become tedious, so aim to vacuum your home about once a week.
 Cigarette smoke can trigger an asthma attack in a cat.If you smoke, do so outside of your home.

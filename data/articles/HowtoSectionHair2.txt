 Not only will the sections make rolling your hair easier, but they will help ensure your curls, waves and lift all fall in the best-possible directions., Using a comb or pick, create a 2-inch wide strip in the middle of your hair, similar to a mohawk. Include hair from your forehead, down the back of your head to the nape of your neck.


Secure the middle section by twisting it and attaching a butterfly clip.
 Secure each side with a pony-tail holder or a butterfly clip.
 Pull the hair taut away from your head, and place a roller on top of the section. Then just roll the hair away from your face and down to your scalp. Secure the roller.


If your hair is too short for rollers, follow the same rolling instructions using a 1-inch barrel curling iron, instead.
 Roll each section away from your face and down to your scalp until the whole center section is in rollers.
 Remove the fastener from your left pony tail, and separate a 2-inch section of hair from your temple.


Pull the section up and across your forehead.
Hold a roller diagonally on top of the ends, and roll the strip away from your face all the way to your scalp. Secure the roller.
Continue rolling the left section of hair, front to back, by separating 2-inch pieces of hair and rolling in the same direction as the first. Secure each roller right next to your scalp.
 Separate two-inch pieces of hair on the right side of your head, from your temple back, and roll them in the same way you rolled your left section.
 Leave the rollers in your hair for 10 minutes before removing them.

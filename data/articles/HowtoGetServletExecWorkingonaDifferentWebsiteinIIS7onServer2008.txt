 In Services, in IIS Manager, click on Default Web Site. In the action pane, click on Start.;
, Choose ServletExec-(your instance), Restart.


You can read your log to see that Servletexec restarted:in C:\Program Files\New Atlanta\ServletExec AS\(your servername)open the ServletExec.log.
 Click on your server name (at the top) of your Sites, above Application Pools, in the Actions pane, click on Restart.
 In ie on the server http://localhost/(your app).

You probably have servletexec admin also working on that default page:either choose Start -> All Programs -> New Atlanta -> ServletExec 6.0 AS -> ServletExec Administrator directly in ie http://localhost/servletexec/admin you should get:











If it is not working, maybe you forgot to set the ISAPI filters.
In IIS manager on the server Home page, click on ISAPI Filters.






You should see Name: "ServletExec" Executable: "c:\InetPub\Scripts\ServletExec_Adapter.dll"

,








The path is: C:\InetPub\Scripts\ServletExec_Adapter.dll
Description is: ServletExec
Allow extension path to execute is checked

,
Your virtual directory MUST be named 'Scripts'







,

With the Virtual Directory 'Scripts' highlighted, click on 'Handler Mappings' in the main screen.






Look for the path *.dll, if it is not there, add it using the 'Add Script Map' in the Actions panel.


Close IIS, reopen IIS, reread step 2 and verify that in the virtual Scripts directory of {MySite} has ISAPI-dll local enabled.






Click on that line, hit Edit, then Request Restrictions, Verbs, and Access tab as described in step 2. 











Click on Edit Feature Permission






Verify that it has 'Script/Execute' as described in step 2 above.
 This is fixed in the next part., In IIS, go to the Application Pools, Select DefaultAppPool (do not double click).


Make a note of the number of applications in the DefaultAppPool.
In the Actions panel, click on View Applications.






You will see two entries for the /Scripts folder.





 
Double click on one line. 






In the drop-down list of the Select Application Pool, you will have a {MySite} selection.





Choose that. Click OK.
If you look now you will see one entry for the /Scripts folder.
Stop the Default Web Site if you now longer need it. You have moved your app to work on {MySite}). (see Part 1 on how to stop a website)
Restart Servletexec. (see Part 1 on how to re/start Servletexec)
Restart IIS. (see Part 1 on how to restart IIS)
Test your app from a non-server location. {url ending in /{yourapp}}
For example: https://something.something.mycompany.com/myapp/myinstance.
You should now have successfully moved your app to work on your {MySite}.

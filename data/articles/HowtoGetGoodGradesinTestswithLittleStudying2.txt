 When you get homework assignments, schedule in time for each of them. Stick to your schedule, so that you always get your homework done on time., Your homework counts for part of your grade, so turning in your homework is important. However, don't just do enough of the work to pass. Actually take the time to work through the assignment. Your homework and reading is a way to reinforce what you're learning in class, and if you take the time to learn it effectively now, you won't have as much studying to do later.
 Don't just skim through your textbook. Read each sentence thoroughly, taking in the information. If you have a hard time paying attention, try reading it aloud to yourself or a friend. Take some time to look at what the main ideas are. It may help you to take notes on the main ideas, just so you have a general overview. Plus, writing down will help reinforce the information., Have a folder or binder for each class, and keep your notes, homework, and tests organized by section and date. That way, you know where all the materials on one topic are, and you can pull them out to review later.

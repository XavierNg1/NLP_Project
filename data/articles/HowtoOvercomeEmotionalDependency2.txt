 Accept that dealing with your feelings is your own job, not anybody else’s. Realize that, while you may experience your emotions strongly, they don’t define who you are or control what you do.For example, you shouldn't expect others to stop what they're doing whenever you're in a bad mood or have a tough day. Instead find healthy ways to cope with negative feelings without needing others to "fix" it for you.
If you can, give yourself a chance to calm down and stabilize a bit before reaching out to a friend.
 When you feel down, look for healthy ways to soothe yourself. Try giving yourself a pep talk, going for a walk, or writing in a journal.Be careful not to replace one type of dependency with another. For instance, if you have anxiety, it’s not a good idea to start using alcohol to calm yourself down.
If you do find yourself turning to alcohol or other substances for emotional reasons, seek help from a doctor or mental health specialist.
 When you feel good about yourself, you’re less likely to depend on other people for attention or approval. Take stock of the things you like about yourself, and remind yourself of your good qualities frequently. Increase your self-esteem by challenging yourself to try new things and finding ways to help others.Your self-talk is a big component of your self-esteem. Instead of criticizing yourself, talk to yourself in a friendly, encouraging way. Say things like "I can do this. I am a capable person. I am in charge of my destiny. Whatever happens, I will do my best."

, Look for the good in people, and keep your expectations reasonable. Don’t get angry if someone occasionally disappoints you. Remind yourself that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.For example, no one is perfect. If a friend forgets your plans, give them the benefit of the doubt, especially if it's a one-off. Otherwise, it's like you expect everyone to be flawless while you are entitled to make mistakes.

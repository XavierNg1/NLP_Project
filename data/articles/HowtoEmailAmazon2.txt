 Make the subject of your e-mail a concise, descriptive sentence. Mention the nature of your inquiry, but don’t put too much detail in the subject.
 Be sure to include as much relevant information as possible to accelerate the customer service process. For instance, if you’re writing about a package you haven’t received, include the order number, the contents of the order and the time you placed the order. You don’t have to include information such as the reason for the order.

 If you are less knowledgeable about purchasing bonds or you do not wish to take the time to conduct the purchase yourself, you can work through a licensed broker. Investment brokers are trained and licensed to provide financial advice and make purchases for you.To find a reputable broker, begin by asking friends for recommendations. You may also check with your own bank to see if they provide this service. Finally, you can research many brokers online. Read their credentials carefully before investing.
 If you are well-educated in investing and you just need someone to make transactions for you, you may wish to choose a discount broker. These are agencies or individuals who just make transactions but provide limited financial advice.If you want someone to provide recommendations and help you set up investments, then you should select a full-service broker., Before you invest with anyone, find out what fees or commissions they charge. Some brokers will collect a flat fee for their service, while others will charge a commission as a percentage of the amount that you invest.Some brokers may advertise “fee free” or “commission free” investments. This may sound attractive, but you should do some research. Look up the price of the bond as quoted directly by the seller and compare it to the broker’s price. Some brokers who offer “fee free” investing actually increase the price of the bond and take their commission that way.
 If you are working with a full-service broker, they may help you decide which tax-free bonds are most favorable. If you have done your own research and are working with a discount broker, then you just need to identify the bond(s) you wish to purchase and the amount.


Some brokers will require an initial deposit of at least $5,000 to work with you. Others may open an account for less. Ask about the requirements so you know what you are getting for your money.

 It is vital as a batsmen to watch what and how each each and every bowler is bowling.;
, "What's the wicket doing?" "Is it turning a lot?" "How much is it swinging?" These are the sorts of questions you should ask batsmen that have already batted before going in to bat.
 This key. What do you think is best for your team? Do you need to go for big shots or do you need to stay in?

,, Don't doubt yourself or your ability. You will do what you've been asked to do.
 The key thing to batting for long periods of time is concentration. Make sure you watch every ball onto the bat, and don't get tempted by the bad ball. Bad balls are just as likely to get you out as good balls are.

 In these versions of the game, a Bubble takes the form of a skull with bat wings on each side engulfed in a ball of fire. It either floats in mid-air or jumps on the ground, and will attack your character on sight.
 Bubbles are indestructible unless you put out its ball of fire first. To do this, raise your shield by pressing the Right Shoulder (R) button on your N64 or Wii controller, then tap the Left Shoulder (L) button on the other side of the controller to do a Shield Bash on the Bubble. This will diffuse the fire, leaving the Bubble vulnerable.
 Once the Bubbleâ€™s fire has been put out, it will jump around the ground trying to avoid you. Take out your sword and attack the monster. It will take around two strikes of your sword to defeat the Bubble.

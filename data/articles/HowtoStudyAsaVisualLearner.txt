Create flashcards. As a visual leaner, those flashcards will be especially effective if you add pictures to them.

Highlight important information and quiz yourself on that. The highlighter will draw your eyes into the key points from a lecture.

 Attaching knowledge to pictures will make it easier for the visual learner to recall.

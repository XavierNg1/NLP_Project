 If the yarn tends to slip off of your finger or gets tangled with the other yarn colors you are using, then a yarn guide might be a helpful option for you. This is a device that slips over your finger and you insert the yarn stands through the device to keep them separated. The device holds the yarn strands so you donâ€™t have to worry about them as much.Check your local craft store or look online for a yarn guide.
These guides are also known as knitting thimbles and strickfingerhuts., Holding your strands too tightly may result in puckering, which can affect the outcome of your finished project. Try to keep a loose hold on the strands so that they do not cause the stitches to pucker.Letting your strands hang or draping them over your fingers is a good way to ensure a loose grip. Check the tension now and then to ensure that it is not too tight.
 Another good way to help prevent tangling while you are stranded knitting is to keep you yarn balls separated.To do this, you can place your yarn balls on opposite sides of you or even put them into separate containers while you work. For example, you could place each ball into a separate bag or plastic container while you work.


Move the containers away from each other as well. For example, you could place one container on one side of you and another container on your other side.

 Scales are usually off-white, tan or brown but can also be other colors. Most of them have a smooth, flat covering but some may look cottony or fluffy. The adults do not move.;
, The young scales, called crawlers, have legs and will move very slowly, or are blown by the wind, to a spot on a plant that they like. Crawlers are often not the same color as the adults of the species. Cottony cushion scales, for example, are off-white but the crawlers are orange.


After the crawlers get to their spot, they will attach to the leaf or stem and eventually lose their legs.
 When they attach to the plant, they pierce it with their mouths and suck the plant juices out.


Scales can become a problem for gardeners all over the world.They survive the winters on plant leaves and stems only to reproduce again when the weather warms and make a meal out of any nearby garden plant.
 The first symptoms are yellow, falling leaves. Eventually twigs and entire limbs die and the tree bark cracks and oozes sap. Soft scales will do some damage but they rarely do enough damage to kill a plant. The most serious problem they cause is honeydew which is a clear, sticky secretion they leave behind as they feed.


Aphids, small, soft-bodied insects excrete honeydew as well. They are usually green or red, although they can be nearly any color, and are more mobile than scale insects.
Sooty mold, a fungus, will often grow on the honeydew causing unsightly dark spots on the leaves and interfering with the plantâ€™s ability to absorb sunlight.

 Put a small amount of an alcohol-based cleaner such as cheap hairspray or rubbing alcohol on an inconspicuous spot on the wood. Wipe the area clean and let it dry.
 Use enough hairspray or other alcohol-based cleaner to fully cover the stain.If you’re using hairspray, cheap hairspray is best, as it contains a higher percentage of alcohol than more expensive hairsprays. Use cotton swabs to apply the hairspray or other household item, especially if the ink stain is a thin line.
 Choose a cloth that you don’t mind getting stained, since the ink will transfer to this cloth. Blot gently by pressing the cloth into the stained area. Do not rub it around or scrub, as this can spread the stain.


Keep turning the cloth over to a fresh surface so that you are not transferring ink back onto the carpet., Use lukewarm water to rinse the carpet thoroughly. Dip an old clean cloth into a bowl of water and wring out some of the excess water. Dab this cloth on the cleaned stain area to help rinse the carpet.


You may need to do this rinsing process several times to fully remove the hairspray.
 Leave the carpet overnight to give it time to dry. Turn up the heat in the room to help speed up the drying process. Vacuum the rug to remove any excess cleaning debris.

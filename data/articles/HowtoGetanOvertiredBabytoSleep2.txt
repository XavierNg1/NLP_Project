 Your baby's room does not need to be pitch black, but the lighting should be dim. Try turning off all of the lights except for a small dim table lamp or night light.
 Try playing a bit of classical, jazz, or new age music to help your baby calm down for sleep. Anything that is slow and soft will work.


Nature sounds can also be helpful. Play your baby some rains sounds or ocean waves crashing on a beach to help him/her fall asleep.
You can also try some white noise, such as a fan.
 An ideal sleeping temperature is around 65 degrees Fahrenheit.If there is a thermostat in your home, then adjusting it to about 65 degrees may help create a better environment for sleep and make it easier for your overtired baby to fall asleep.


You can also place a room thermometer in your baby’s room and adjust the room temperature by opening a window, turning on a fan, or turning up the heat if it is too cold.
 Swaddling can be soothing and may help an overtired baby fall asleep. Swaddling is the process of wrapping your baby in a blanket so that she is snug and secure.You will only need to use a lightweight blanket to swaddle your baby.


Lay the blanket down so that it looks like a diamond and fold over the corner that is furthest from you.
Then, lay your baby down on the blanket so that his/her head rests on the folded corner.
Pull up one side of the blanket and place it across your baby’s chest.
Then, fold the bottom of the blanket up and over your baby’s feet. Tuck the bottom end of the blanket over your baby’s shoulder.
Finally, fold over the remaining side of the blanket over your baby’s chest.
When you are done, the swaddling should be snug, but not tight.

 Babies are usually ready for sleep between 6pm and 9pm. If you are putting your child to bed later than 9pm, or if they seem to be getting tired before you put them to sleep, try setting an earlier bedtime. The sleep regression, in some instances, could be due to the fact that the baby is overtired and unable to fall asleep., A set bedtime routine can help to prepare your child both physically and mentally for sleep. Choose a few calm and relaxing activities that will help transition your child to sleep. For example, you may give your toddler a glass of milk, brush their teeth, and then read two stories in bed, before turning out the lights.Avoid stimulating activities, such as watching television, actively playing, or reading a scary story.
 Many people will change their bedtime routine as a way to cope or manage sleep regression in toddlers. For example, you may be tempted to stay with your child until they fall asleep as a form of comfort. This is not a good idea and could lead to the formation of a new habit.Instead, it is important to stick with your regular routine. Sleep regressions typically only last 2-6 weeks and are normal among toddlers., Toddlers may try and stay up later by requesting another story or asking for more milk. One way to prevent these types of regressions is by setting clear limits and following them consistently.For example, you may say “We can read three stories and then it is sleepy time.” After the third story, you need to say goodnight and turn out the lights.

 If you see an error like “waiting…” or “installing” when trying to install an update, it’s usually due to a network issue., Now you’ll see the Wi-Fi switch, which should be green to show that it’s turned on.


If the switch is gray, tap it to turn on Wi-Fi.
 If you see a blue checkmark next to the network name, you can skip this step. Otherwise, tap your wireless network and enter a passcode (if prompted) to connect., This may clear up issues with your home network.


Unplug the power cable from your router. The router is the device that connects to your phone or cable line.
Wait 30 seconds and then reconnect the power. After about a minute, the router should come back online.
 If rebooting your router didn’t solve the problem (or if you’re not on your own home network):


Open the Settings app and tap Wi-Fi.
Tap a different wireless network. Note that if you see a padlock next to a network, you’ll be prompted to enter a passcode.

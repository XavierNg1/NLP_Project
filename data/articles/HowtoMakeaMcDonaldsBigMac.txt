 Store it in the refrigerator for about an hour before use to allow flavors to blend.;
, Take the crusts of the bun or in other words the bottom and top part where it's hard, and feed it to the birds, use it as a coaster, or just throw it away if you wish because it's not needed in this recipe.
 Flatten two patties to about 3-1/2 inches (85mm) in diameter, and about 1/4 inch (8mm) thick.



Mince about a quarter of a small white onion and set aside.
Shred or chop an iceberg lettuce leaf into thin strips.
 You can cook it however you wish and to your preference for doneness (rare to well done).
 While the patties are frying, gently toast the buns. Do this to the both sides of the regular bun bottom and toast the sesame bun as usual (the inner sides).
 Take the bottom of the regular bun and the bottom of the sesame bun and put 1 tablespoon of the sauce on them.
 Grab a big pinch of the sliced lettuce and plop it onto each sauced bun.


On the bottom bun (the sesame), place a slice of cheese on top of the lettuce. On the regular bun, put the pickle slices on the lettuce.
 Stack each burger patty on top of the condiments (cheese and pickles) on each layer. Top both layers with minced onions.
 Pick up, carefully, the regular bun (with everything) and stack it on the bottom layer.


Place the top of the sesame bun on top of the burger.

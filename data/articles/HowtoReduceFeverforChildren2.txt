 Dress feverish children in lightweight clothing and cover them with a thin blanket or sheet only if they are shivering or complaining of being cold.Heavy clothing and blankets prevent the body from naturally cooling itself., Lower the thermostat so the room temperature is slightly cooler than usual. Keep a fan close, if necessary, to keep your child cool.You can also open the windows if it is not too cold outside. Generally, anything below 68 °F (20°C) outside would be too cold for a child with a fever., When your child is awake, make sure he or she has a comfortable, supportive pillow to rest his or her head on., Extra or unnecessary movement will raise the body temperature in your child, so be sure they rest in one place and bring them what they need. Never allow your child to engage in strenuous activities when he or she is running a fever., You should know whether a fever is going up or down, or if it is staying steady. Check your child’s temperature often and make sure you are following the proper instructions for thermometer use.Never use an oral thermometer on a child who has just drank or eaten something cold. This can skew the results the thermometer gives you.Rectal thermometers provide the most accurate results, especially for children under one year old, but are uncomfortable for the child and are more difficult for you to use when trying to get a proper reading., Most children who are running a fever will show other symptoms of illness, such as a stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, a headache, an upset stomach, or other physical symptoms. Use safe and effective measures to treat those other symptoms, as they can prevent your child from resting comfortably, which will ultimately help in reducing the fever.

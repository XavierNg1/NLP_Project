 If you don't have a cash flow problem or can borrow from the bank easily, taking advantage of the discount is almost always warranted. However, if you find yourself struggling to come up with money to pay vendors, the ability to pay the full amount late may be more advantageous., Using the above example, with a 2 percent discount on a $500 dollar invoice, the savings would be $10 if you pay within 10 days. Decide if the savings are worth using your cash earlier than necessary in the month by calculating the annual savings you would earn for the extra 20 days.


For example, if you have the opportunity to do this every 20 days, it would happen 18 times a year (365 days divided by 20 days = 18). That means you could save up to $180 ($10 X 18 times per year) each year by using a $490 amount each month., First calculate what the annual interest rate would be, based on the two percent discount, for example, provided by the vendor if you pay in 10 days. This is because you will be earning interest on the discounted amount if you had it in the bank., For example, let's say you are offered a 2 percent discount for paying a bill within 10 days. You can calculate what that 2 percent would be worth on an annual basis. That is because you have the use of the money for an additional 20 days (assuming 30 days in a month). To find the comparable annual interest rate set up a ratio:


2 percent or .02 / 20 days = x percent / 365 days. Then solve for x. .02 x 365 = 20x. Therefore the comparable annual interest rate is .365 or 36.5 percent.Since 36.5 percent in this example is a very high interest rate, this demonstrates it is usually advantageous for a customer to take advantage of an early payment discount if you have enough money in your checking account or you have a line of credit.

 If you wouldn’t feel 100% comfortable walking around your business barefoot (including the bathrooms and showers) you have a big cleanliness issue. If you’re paying attention, you’ll notice the moment you walk into a business whether or not, the owner values cleanliness.

Your customers may forgive you for a lot of things including a small facility, or old equipment, but they will never forgive you for an unclean or unsanitary workout environment. The reason this is strongly stressed on is because this is the low hanging fruit.
No matter your resources or your budget, you can improve the cleanliness of your gym today and it's a promise that your members will notice.

, Keeping your business clean is easy once you institutionalize cleanliness as a policy. Start by creating a cleaning checklist for your business. The columns of your checklist should represent days of the week and the rows of your checklist should represent items to clean or specific cleaning actions (such as ‘vacuum all floor mats’). Once you have a checklist, make sure that your staff follows the check list every single day.
 After your staff gets the hang of utilizing the checklists, then start performing random audits of their work. Take a checklist and randomly highlight 5-10 rows and do a walk-through with the person who is responsible for the list. For each item that you highlighted, give it a score (A-F) and when you’re done, write the cumulative score on top of the checklist. By doing random walk-throughs with your cleaning staff, they will learn how you like things cleaned and which items are of the highest priority.

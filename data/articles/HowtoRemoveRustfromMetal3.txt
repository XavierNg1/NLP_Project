 If you happen to come into contact with rust, you can remove the residue from your clothing using lemon juice and water.









Apply lemon juice to the affected area, but donâ€™t let it dry. Use water to rinse the juice and rust away.
Wash the article of clothing after using the lemon juice to aid in removing the rust.
For heavier fabric with a worse rust stain, you can also apply salt to the area in addition to lemon juice.

, Kittens will usual use the litter box. If they go to the bathroom anywhere other than the litter, move the waste into the litter box to show them where they should go.
 Let the kitten get used to the new area and its smell.
 The kitten is very afraid of you and can lash out if it feels to threatened.
 Let the kitten get used to you and your scent before trying to pet or touch. Read or watch videos to entertain yourself.
 Make sure to remove the string from the kitten area after playing, if swallowed, the string could injury your kitten. When using the laser, keep out of the eyes of the kitten. Don't try to touch the kitten anytime it's playing.
 Over a few days, move the food dish closer to you or start feeding the kitten from your hand. Move the plate a little closer, but don't touch the kitten yet.
 Get the kitten used to your touch. The kitten might hiss or spit at you at first.
 Moving the kitten somewhere you are often will help the taming process.
 Also try petting with out these things. If the kitten is lashing out, slow down and repeat step 6 and 7. Never force the kitten in your lap with out something good to make it a good thing.
 Start working on picking up. Set your hands on the kittens sides and left it up a bit. Remove hands and reward kitten by petting. Do this a few times then pick kitten up and move it towards food or on to lap for pets.
 This should help the kitten get used to other people.

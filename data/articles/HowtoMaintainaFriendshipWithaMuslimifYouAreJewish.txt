 As said before, a friendship is a friendship, no matter what. One of my best friends is a Turkish Muslim, and while we have disagreements on certain things, we don't let anything get between us.;
, When ever having a discussion, consider their opinion as equal, and that either of us can be right.
 Never bring up some areas of discussion, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, radicalism from each side, Gaza/Lebanon, or general belligerence (hostility) between both sides (Mashhad massacre, Cave of Patriarch shooting, violence encounters between Judaism and Islam are especially risky)

, This is very helpful as it brings up a protagonist effect. Some examples of topics could be Kosher/Halal, Monotheism, and even history. But don't get too risky in your conversations (Circumcision is a no-no.)

, Study about each others religions, and customs. Always be respectful.
 They may not always be as easy to deal with. Always watch your tongue!

, Unfortunately prejudice is common, and we are all victims of it. If you ever see some ignorant folks beating on your friend, stand up for him or her.

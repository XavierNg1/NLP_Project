 Start by casting three new stitches onto your needle in front of the other stitches. Use the working yarn to cast on new stitches as usual., Knit the first two stitches individually by inserting the needle into the back loop, yarning over, and pulling through the loop as you let it slide off the needle., You will need to knit the next two stitches together for this cast off method. Insert the needle through the back of both loops and yarn over. Then, pull through both loops and let them slip off the needle as you transfer the new loop to the opposite needle., At this point, you should have three stitches on your right needle. Transfer these back over to the left needle to continue the I-cord cast off., Cast on three stitches again and repeat the rest of the process as you did before. Keep repeating this sequence to the end of the project.

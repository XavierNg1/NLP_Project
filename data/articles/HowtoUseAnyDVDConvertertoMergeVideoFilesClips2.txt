 Avidemux is a free, open source video editing program, and you can use it to merge clips of any length into a single video file. You can download Avidemux from fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/.
 Launch Avidemux and click "File" → "Open". Browse for the first video clip you want to use.
 Click "File" → "Append" and select the second video file. After you select it, it will be added to the end of the first video clip.


In order to use this method, the files will need to have the same dimensions and the same format. You can use Avidemux to convert the individual videos to a common format and size before merging them.
 You can keep using the "Append" command to add more clips to the end of the video file. You can't easily adjust the order later, so make sure you add them in the order you want.
 Click "File" → "Save" and save your new video file. It will be saved in the format of the original video. The encoding process may take a few minutes to complete.

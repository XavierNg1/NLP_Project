 Once your dog and your partner are comfortable around one another, travel from a neutral meeting location back to your home all together. Upon entering the space you share with your dog, give one of your dog’s favorite items to your partner. Then have your partner say the dog’s name and offer them the item., Don’t suddenly disappear on your dog and spend all your time with your new partner. Not only is this unfair to your dog, they will likely notice the change in your behavior and may even realize that it’s your partner keeping you away.To prevent this from happening, go on dates all together! Picnics, hikes, and even bars with patios are great places to spend a multi-species date.
 Once they really seem comfortable together, ask your partner to watch your dog next time you have individual obligations. The opportunity to bond one on one is especially likely to make them both more comfortable around one another.

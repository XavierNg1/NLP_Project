 Carnation plants can be rejuvenated by splitting their root masses into separate plants. To do this, dig up an older carnation plant and use your hands to separate it into two. Replant the divided parts and give them a good watering.


You should not let the plant dry out until it is established.
 Carnations grow well from cuttings. You may find that a cutting is a good way to replace plants once they are past their prime, which is usually when they reach two to three years of age. It’s important to only propagate from healthy ‘parent’ plants. To make a cutting:


Cut a non-flowering piece of one of your plant’s shoots. Try to do this first thing in the morning if you can. This cutting should be about four inches long.






Cut below a leaf node using a very sharp, clean blade. The shoot should be recent growth from the same year. Remove the lower leaves.






Dip the cut into a rooting hormone and then plant it halfway down a planter that has been filled with coarse sand.






Water, then place a clear plastic bag around the plant.






Place this in a bright spot out of direct sunlight, such as a window ledge that does not get full sun. Maintain moisture until the plants are established and you can see growth.
 Carnations can also be propagated by a method called ‘layering’. To do this, prepare the soil around the plant you wish to propagate as you would for planting a cutting (mixing in sand to compost or peat, then watering the area).Next:


Find a healthy side shoot and strip off the lowest leaves. Halfway along the length make a vertical slit in the stem with a sharp knife.






Bend the stem over and plant the cut midsection into the ground. A good tip is to use a bit of wire or a hairpin to anchor it in the soil. It will eventually root from the cut bit of the stem.






Keep the soil moist for about six weeks, then you can cut it from the parent. Leave it for another month before relocating it.

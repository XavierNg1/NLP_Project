 Fill the sink with hot water and squirt a few drops of dishwashing liquid into it. Submerge the sippy cups in the water and wash the cups thoroughly, using the brush that you prefer. Cotton swabs and pipe cleaners are perfect for the small crannies that are hard to reach with a regular brush.

 You can do this by putting two to three tablespoons of baking soda into each sippy cup. Fill the inside of the sippy cup with boiling or hot water. Let the baking soda stay in the cup overnight. Wash the cups with water and soap to complete the cleaning process.

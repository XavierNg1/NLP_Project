 Potential allies to look for include bouncers, bar tenders, teachers, or any authority figure who happens to be around. If your aggressor arrived or was interacting with other people in the crowd, keep an eye on their actions as well.
 If you’re outside, look for sticks and rocks, and if you’re inside, look for a chair or stool to break (and use as a club/shield), or even silverware or glassware to use. If you can use them, your belt and keys may also prove valuable as weapons or deterrents., Mind your physical surroundings as well—you can use them defensively (to hide behind, or climb on) or offensively (to turn into weapons). If you’re ever faced with more than one aggressor, try to get to a place where you’re harder to get at, and where only one person is able to attack you at once.

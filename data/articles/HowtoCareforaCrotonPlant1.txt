 Crotons need high humidity which is difficult to provide in most homes. However, you can run a humidifier in the room or set a humidity tray below the croton plant.Placing multiple plants close together also increases the humidity in the immediate area. Misting the croton every morning with room-temperature water may help a little but the water usually evaporates too quickly to do much good.;
, It is fairly simple and inexpensive to create a humidity tray. Simply fill a shallow dish or pan with pebbles and water. Set the croton just above the humidity tray.


As the water evaporates naturally, it will increase the humidity around the plant.
 Keep the room temperature above 70 degrees Fahrenheit.


If the croton starts dropping its leaves after they become yellow and dry, the humidity is too low. #Make sure your croton is exposed to a few hours of direct sunlight each day. The easiest way to supply this light is to set the crotons in front of a south- west- or east-facing window.They will drop their leaves when they are not getting enough light.
 If a bright, sunny area is not available in the home or office, additional light can be provided with a fluorescent lamp. Set the lamp up so that the bulb is about 6 inches away from the croton. Install a special fluorescent grow light bulb in the lamp and leave the lamp on for 14 to 16 hours each day.The lamp should be turned on in the morning around sunrise. Plug the lamp into a timer that can be programmed to turn it on automatically each morning and shut it off 14 to 16 hours later to be sure the croton gets the light it needs every day.

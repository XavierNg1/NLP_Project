 Point your web browser to google.com/android/devicemanager or download the Android Device Manager app on another Android device. This method should work for virtually any Android device that was purchased in the past few years, as long as you had associated it with your Google account., You will be prompted to enter in your Google account log-in credentials. Be sure you enter in the credentials associated with your phone if you have multiple Google accounts.


If you can't remember your Google password, see How to Recover a Gmail Password for details on recovering it.
 If you have multiple Android devices, they will all be listed here. From the options on the left side of the screen underneath your device name, you will see three options: Ring, Lock, and Erase. Clicking Lock, although counter-intuitive, will allow you to set up a temporary password on your device that will override any pattern lock or PIN number.
 Enter in some sort of password that you will use to unlock your Android device. Make sure to remember this password by writing it down somewhere.


You will be asked to confirm the password as well.
 After you have entered the appropriate information, click the Lock button in the bottom right of the pop-up window. If successful, you will see a notification pop up beneath the Ring, Lock, and Erase options.
 On the locked screen, enter in the password you just created. You should now be granted access to your locked device. You may have to wait up to five minutes for your new password to take effect.

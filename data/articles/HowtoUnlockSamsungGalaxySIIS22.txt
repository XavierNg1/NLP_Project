 If you have a rooted S2, you can use an app to retrieve your code for free. See this guide for details on rooting your S2. Rooting your phone will void the warranty.


You can check that your phone is rooted by looking for the Superuser app, or by trying to install Titanium Backup.
 This app is available for free from the Google Play store, and is developed by Chainfire. You must have a rooted phone in order to use it.
 After the app has installed, launch it. you will be greeted by a short menu. Tap "SIM unlock code" to begin retrieving your code.


This app will not work on the newest versions of the S2.
 The retrieval process can take a significant amount of time. You can monitor the progress from the display on your screen. Once the code is retrieved, it will be displayed for you to copy down.


If the app does not retrieve your code, don't try again. Repeating the process may freeze your phone. If you cannot retrieve your code, you will need to contact your carrier for it.
 Once you have received your unlock code, power down your phone, remove the back from your S2, and take out the battery. Remove the old SIM card from the slot and insert the SIM card from your new carrier.
 When you turn your phone back on, you will be prompted for your unlock code when the phone tries to connect to the new network. Ensure that you are in the coverage area for your new network, and then enter in the code you received from your carrier or the online reseller. After entering the code, you should be able to use your phone on the new network.


After unlocking your phone, you can change SIM cards whenever you'd like without having to enter the code again.

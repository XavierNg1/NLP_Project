 If you don't already have a Skype account

If you're an existing user, you can simply log into the Skype program with your email address, username, or phone number (and the accompanying password).
 This is in the top right corner of the Skype website., From here, you'll need to enter the following information:

Your extension (for example, "+1" in the United States or "+44" in the UK)
Your phone number (or email address)
A password for your account
Your first and last name
Your current country/region
Your date of birth

, Depending on which type of contact information you entered earlier, this will either go to your email address or your phone in the form of an SMS. After entering this code, your account will be completely set up.,, After doing so, Skype will open to your account--your call will come in here., Your computer will bring up Skype's incoming call window on top of whatever other windows you have open when your call comes in.

If your computer's volume is enabled, you'll hear Skype ringing when your call comes in.
 You can do this in one of three ways:

To answer the call with audio only, click the phone icon (middle button).
To answer the call with video input, click the video camera icon (far left).
To decline the call, click the red button (far right).
 This may take a few seconds, after which you can enjoy your call.

 Water is the lifeblood of your organs: they need it to stay alive and look healthy. Some doctors recommend drinking at least 2 liters (0.5 US gal) of water a day, while others recommend that you drink water whenever you're thirsty or parched. Drinking water — and cutting sugary soft drinks, juices, and energy drinks from your regimen — may help your pores look smaller.
 Although there hasn't been a proven scientific link yet, many people believe that unhealthy diets can contribute to larger pores. That's because poor diets can contribute to excessive sebum production, which gets caught in pores and keeps them from looking lovely and lithe.
 We learned earlier that ice can shrink pores by constricting blood vessels and tightening the surrounding skin. If you're in a pinch and need visibly smaller pores for a short period of time, try this trick.

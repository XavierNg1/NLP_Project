 Using breastfeeding as a form of birth control (the LAM) can be effective if it’s done correctly. As long as you meet three requirements, then breastfeeding your baby suppresses your fertility and prevents pregnancy. Breastfeeding alone does not prevent pregnancy – you must meet the additional criteria in order to be protected, and as soon as one of your criteria changes you need to use alternate birth control. You can rely on breastfeeding as a birth control method if you fit into all three of these categories:You have not had a period since you gave birth.
Your baby is under 6 months old.
You nurse on demand at least every four hours during the day and every six hours at night, so that your baby gets all or most of its nutrition from breastfeeding.
 The rhythm method, also called the timing method or fertility awareness method, requires that you have a detailed understanding of your fertility cycle. This is usually done by measuring the length of your cycle and recognizing signs of ovulation like changes in your cervical mucus and basal body temperature. Because these body functions can be in disarray for several weeks after you have a baby, don’t attempt this method until you start having regular menstrual cycles again.You can try this method if you don’t want to use hormonal or physical methods of birth control, but it’s only about 75% effective. If you opt for this method, get instructions from your OB/GYN about how to do it correctly.
 The success rate of withdrawal, or “pulling out,” is low. This method requires proper timing and self-restraint, and as many as 28 out of 100 women still get pregnant if they practice this method for a year.For better protection against pregnancy, use a different method.

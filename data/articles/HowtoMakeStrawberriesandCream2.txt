 Place them in a colander and rinse them carefully. Use a paring knife to slice off the green tops. Slice the strawberries in half lengthwise, then cut them into quarters.
 Let the strawberries sit in the bowl for 5-10 minutes, until their juices have been released.
 While the strawberries react with the sugar to release their juices, get the mascarpone ready.Put the mascarpone cheese and yogurt in a mixing bowl. Add the remaining sugar and vanilla pod seeds.
Mix the ingredients together. Stir thoroughly or beat with a whisk.
 Spoon a generous serving of the mascarpone cheese onto a serving plate. Push a well into the center of each cream serving, using the back of a spoon. Place strawberry slices inside the mascarpone well on each serving.


Drizzle over the top of the strawberries using the leftover juice from the strawberries bowl.
If you wish, crumble some shortbread over each serving. It's now ready to serve immediately.

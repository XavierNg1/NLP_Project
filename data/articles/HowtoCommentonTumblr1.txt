 Log into Tumblr and head to your dash. From the dash, click on the Account icon in the upper right corner of the page, and select Settings from the drop-down menu. This should redirect you to the “Settings” page.


The Account icon looks like the silhouette of a person, and the Settings option should be labeled with a gear icon.
Note that you do NOT need to follow these steps if you only wish to comment on someone else's Tumblr blog. Only follow these steps if you wish to allow others to leave comments on your blog.;
, Locate the name of your blog on the right panel of the “Settings” page. Click on the blog name to be redirected from the "Account Settings" page to the "Blog Settings" page.
 Check one or both tick boxes to enable comments on your blog posts.


There are two options, and you can either select one or both:

"Allow replies from people you follow" will allow any user who follows you to leave a reply.
"Allow replies from people who have been following you for more than two weeks" will allow anyone who has followed your blog for 14 days to leave a reply.
Selecting both will only allow users to comment on your posts if they meet both conditions.


Tumblr will auto-save your changes immediately after you make them.
 Scroll down until you see the "Ask" section of your settings, which should be just beneath the "Replies" section. Check the tick box to allow users to send private questions to your blog.


The exact option should read, "Let people ask questions."
When you enable this option, you'll need to choose a title for the ask page of your blog. The default title is, “Ask me anything.” You'll also need to decide whether or not to allow anonymous questions.
Tumblr should auto-save your changes immediately after you make them.

 Since the order is automatically triggered by the movement of a stock's price, the you will not have to monitor the price per share on a daily basis. There is also no cost to place a stop-loss order. A commission from the brokerage firm is charged only when the stop-loss order's price is reached, the order becomes a market order, and the sale is completed., In a rapidly falling market, there is no guarantee the selling price will be the same as the stop price. It may be different and the loss will be higher than expected. Also, a broker or dealer may not allow a stop order to be placed on some securities including Over the Counter (OTC) and/or penny stocks., You can use stop limit orders to protect yourself when the market is choppy. Stop limit orders are a tool you can use to protect yourself from substantial losses. A general rule of thumb is to set your stop loss order to 5 to 10 percent below your purchase price. This helps to keep your losses manageable.However, if the stock price starts to climb, adjust your stops upward.

 Begin by floating the temporary container in the tank to make sure that both are the same temperature. Hopefully they are close to the same temperature, so this will only take about 10 to 15 minutes.In most cases, your starfish will come in a plastic bag. If this is sealed tight, it can be floated on the top of the tank water to equalize the temperature.
 Place the starfish's temporary container next to the aquarium. In order to slowly acclimate the starfish to its new tank, you will need to place the temporary container next to the tank and run a drip line between them.Drip lines are typically available at aquarium stores and online aquarium suppliers. They typically come with parts at the end that can control the flow of liquid.
 In order to make the acclimation of the starfish gradual, you should introduce the new water very slowly. As such, the drip method will take quite a bit of time. Start the siphoning and then assess how fast it is dripping.Plan for at least 2 hours when introducing a starfish to its new environment. Starfish are very fragile during the acclimation phase to a new aquarium, and the whole process must be taken slowly.
 Watch the level of the water in the shipping container and once it is full, dump out half of it. Then begin dripping in tank water once again. You should do this process several times in order to get the starfish acclimated to its new tank.When you dump out half of the water, put it down the drain, not back into the tank. This will assure that the tank levels remain balanced.
 Once you have added tank water into the temporary container for several hours, you can move the starfish into its new home. As quickly as you can, lift the starfish out of its temporary tank and place it on a rock in its new tank. The goal should be to limit its exposure to the air as much as possible.

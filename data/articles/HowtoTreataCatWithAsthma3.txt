 Because cats can have asthma attacks just like people, you will need to know what to do if your cat has a severe asthma attack. Give your cat albuterol (under the supervision of your vet once a diagnosis has been reached), which is a very effective emergency bronchodilator.A cat having an asthma attack will hunch its body toward the ground and extend its neck forward.However, this is a general sign of respiratory distress, rather than specific to asthma.
Even if you normally give your cat a long-acting bronchodilator, your vet may prescribe the albuterol so you can have it on hand for emergency situations.
 A cat with serious breathing trouble needs immediate veterinary care.Giving your cat the albuterol will open the airways and make your cat’s breathing a little easier. While the albuterol is taking effect, contact your vet or an emergency vet hospital and let them know your cat is having an asthma attack.
 A cat having a serious asthma attack may need to be hospitalized until it is stable and strong enough to go back home.If your cat needs to be hospitalized, your vet will give your cat a bronchodilator and oxygen therapy.They will monitor your cat’s breathing and its overall health.

 If you’re under 18, you may need your parent’s permission to get the piercing. They will have to go with you to sign a consent form.If you are over 18 and hold a job, check with your employer about dress codes. Also, if you go to a private school, you’ll want to find out if face piercings are acceptable.;
, Don’t go looking for a bargain. You don’t want to risk anything going wrong. Instead, ask around. Word of mouth is a great way to find a reputable piercer. If no one knows of anyone, start looking some up online. Go into the shop and get to know your piercer before you decide. Ask them about previous piercings that they've done, if there were every any issues, and how long they've been doing them. Sometimes, they’ll even have a photo album for you to look through.


Ask to see certificates that their Autoclave has passed spore tests. If they do not have an autoclave, leave immediately.
The shop should be clean and sanitary.
Some piercers are registered with the APP. Whilst this ensures they should be sanitary in their work, it does not mean that they do good piercings. Always check feedback of their customers and do not assume that an APP certificate means that they are a good piercer.
 You’ll need to bring your license for sure. Some states require a birth certificate as well. The laws change from state to state, so check about the law in your area.

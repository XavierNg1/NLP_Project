 Mix 3 cups of milk, 3 tbsp. of cornstarch, ½ teaspoon of salt, ½ cup (100 g.) of sugar, 2 tbsp. of butter, and a pinch of vanilla extract together in a pan. Mix the ingredients together until they've blended well.;
, Heat the ingredients until they're reached a simmer. Then, remove them from the heat.
 Whisk the 4 egg yolks together until they turn pale. This should take about 1 minute.
 Pour the cream into the egg yolk and continue to whisk the yolks as you do this. This will heat the yolks gently without cooking them.
 Stir it constantly with a wooden spoon as it continues to heat up. Take care to scrape the bottom of the pan with the spoon so the custard doesn't stick. Cook until the custard thickens to the desired consistency. Do not allow the custard to boil -- this will curdle it leaving you with a lumpy mess.
 Wait at least five minutes for the ingredients of the custard to thicken a bit.
 Sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon and a handful of berries over the custard and enjoy this rich and creamy dessert.

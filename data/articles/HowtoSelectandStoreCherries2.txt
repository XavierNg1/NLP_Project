 Unless you are going to dry them, your cherries should be placed in a dark, cool place. Cherries should at no point be placed in an area where they will be exposed to a large amount of sunlight. This exposure will shrink and wrinkle them which will sap their flavor.
 Cherries stay fresh in cold temperatures. Only keep your cherries at room temperature for a very short time. To keep your cherries fresh, you should refrigerate them. You just need to put the cherries in a resealable plastic bag, and then place the bag in the refrigerator. They will stay fresh for 3–5 days, or even up to two weeks.


If you keep cherries at room temperature, then you should be prepared to eat them immediately. For the cherries will only be good for up to 2 days. Make sure to wash and dry all cherries before eating.
 Cherries will pick up flavors from other items in your fridge. Therefore, if you don’t want your cherries to taste like your stew or garlic, then you need to put them in a space that doesn’t contain any fragrant items.


To help avoid this, make sure that you seal your cherries in containers or plastic bags. This will make it harder for the cherries to be permeated by smelly items in your fridge.
 By freezing cherries, you will make sure that they keep their freshness and flavor. You should choose whether you want to pit them or not. You don’t need to pit them, but some prefer to do this. After you make this decision, then you just need to get your materials ready. Pull out a baking sheet, line the cherries in one layer then put them in the freezer. Wait for an hour, take them out and drop them in a couple of bags. You should make sure they are completely firm before you do this.


When you put them in bags, make sure to squeeze as much air out as possible to avoid freezer burn. Frozen cherries can be kept for up to a year.

 This may seem stupid but in the long run this can help you to create a plan to accomplish your task.;
, For example, let's say you want to get higher grades. Ask yourself what type of grades do you want. Let's say your goal is have a 90 GPA in the next marking period.
 In this case take this task one test at a time.
 By studying for that one test over a weeks time, you should get a very high grade, but like any high school student you don't just have one test.
 Study for the test from when you find out about the test(s) to the day before the test(s)this will let you study for multiple tests without causing too much stress.
 Set a time for study and time for play. Perhaps you like to do your homework/ studying in the morning. This lets you enjoy your weekend while also getting work done.
 If you don't do well on one test, don't get saddened. Try to do better on the next test.
 If you lack discipline this might be a hard task. Never give up and try to remember your original goal.

 Dental implants have become one of the most well-liked tooth replacement options for dentists and patients all over the world. A tooth implant is basically an artificial tooth root-like structure that is placed within your jawbone.These implants are created from titanium or titanium alloys.
 If your jawbone is healthy and strong enough to support a dental implant, you should consider getting one. It takes a couple of months for the implant to bond with the bone. If the bone itself is weak or the X-rays show that the bone density is not sufficient, the implants wonâ€™t bond with the bone. Also consider:


If your gums are healthy and disease-free. Strong gums are indicative of healthy bone structure as well.
If you do not have any bone destructive disease like diabetes

, Dental implants can preserve the remaining natural teeth in their original form. The neighboring teeth are not at all affected as they are when you get a dental bridge. Also:


They work independent of the neighboring teeth just as a natural tooth works independent of the rest of the teeth.
Their aesthetic looks make them more in demand as they look as though they have grown from the gums like a natural tooth.
They are a one-time investment as they are extremely durable and last for a lifetime when oral hygiene is well maintained.
 Dental implants are quite expensive. In addition to this, they are surgically inserted, which means that the installation of dental implants are invasive in nature.


The placement of dental implants is a time-taking procedure as the surgical wound needs time to heal properly.
You have to wait three to six months after you have lost your tooth to get it replaced with a dental implant.

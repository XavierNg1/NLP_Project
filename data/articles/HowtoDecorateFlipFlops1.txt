 If not, clean existing ones that are in very good condition. The flip flops need to be in good condition or decorating them won't improve them.;
, Artificial flowers can be made from cotton fabric, silk, scrap fabric, plastic, etc. Either make your own or purchase them already made.


Match the color to the flip flops. Or, choose complementary colors.
Artificial flowers are available from craft stores, florists, gift stores, online, etc.
 Usually the middle point where both straps meet is the ideal position, as it's the broadest part of the straps and shows off the front of your feet nicely. Larger flowers are best placed here, but you could also consider adding a row of smaller flowers down the straps for a pumped up floral look.
 If the flowers have stems that are flexible, these might be amenable to wrapping around the straps but test to see it's comfortable first.


It's a good idea to test the glue strength before adding too many flowers. If they don't adhere well, then you'll need to choose another glue.
 Enjoy your refurbished flip flops.

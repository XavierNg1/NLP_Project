 A punch biopsy is when the doctor uses a special tool to punch into the skin around the mole. The tool has a circular blade, and the doctor presses it to the skin to remove a circular piece of skin to biopsy. The doctor will numb the skin around the area being biopsied.Punch biopsies are done for smaller moles when the doctor wants to remove the entire mole.;
, One way that doctors can biopsy the mole is to surgically shave it to the same flat level as your skin. They will give you an anesthetic in the area and allow the area to go numb. Then, they will take a scalpel to cut the mole away.Skin shaves are often used for small moles or freckle-like areas that are flat on the skin.
Often, the area where the mole is removed will be closed by cauterisation, which is when they apply heat to close the wound.
 The doctor may decide to perform a surgical excision. This process is when the doctor numbs the skin and then removes the entire mole and the surrounding tissue. Then they stitch the skin closed.A surgical excision is used for small to medium sized areas, when the doctor wants to remove the entire mole and surrounding tissue.
 During an incisional biopsy, the doctor will numb the area and then only cut off the irregular part of the mole instead of removing the whole thing. Then, they will examine the sample of tissue in a lab.An incisional biopsy technique is used when removing the entire mole is difficult, such as when it is too big to remove through other techniques.

 If you want to ignore someone by changing your routine, the easiest thing to do is to change your walking route so you no longer bump into that person. If you always bump into that person between classes, take the long way to get to your next class so you don't have to see that person. If you always run into that person at work, start using a different hallway or bathroom to minimize contact.


If you always see that person when you're walking no matter where you go, start driving places.
If that person seems to have changed their walking routine to fit to yours, keep changing yours until they give up.
 This one is a no-brainer. If you know that person's favorite bars, restaurants, and parks, just don't go there anymore. It won't be worth it, unless you want to spend the whole time there actively ignoring that person.


You can also learn the days when that person goes out. If he only goes to their favorite restaurant on weekends, and you really want to go there, you can just go during the week.
If that person only goes to a certain bar during happy hour, just hang out there later at night.
 If that person is a meat lover, start checking out the vegetarian restaurants in your hood. If that person hates jazz, check out the latest jazz concert in your area. If their mortal enemies with one of your friends, then that friend's parties are a great place to escape that person.


By actively going to places where that person will never go, you're not only ignoring them, but seeking out newer, cooler hangouts that don't involve that person.

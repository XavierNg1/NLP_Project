 If you want to make a clean break, have a friend or parent set a block password on your computer so that you won’t be able to access YouTube. , Put a strict personal limit on how much time you spend with your eyes on a screen- it’s generally considered unhealthy to spend more than four hours a day in front of a computer. Excessive computer use can lead to various issues, such as:


Musculoskeletal problems.
Headache.
Repetitive stress injuries.
Vision problems. , If your addiction is in the early stages, you may be able to gradually lessen your need by managing your computer time.
 Within your allotted computer time, make sure you take care business first, before going on to YouTube videos. One of the benefits of breaking your addiction is that you will be in control of your time- rather than your addiction being in control of you.


Get time management software. There are programs available that can track your time spent on different applications, so you can have an accurate idea of what you’re spending the most time doing (or not doing). Use an “internet nanny” service, such as Net Nanny or K9 web protection. These are parental control programs which can set blocks on certain websites, or control the amount of time certain applications are available each day. Use the internet to further yourself, rather than getting swept up in entertainment for instant gratification. The internet is a gold mine of current information, history, and every other kind of knowledge there is. Use it to learn.

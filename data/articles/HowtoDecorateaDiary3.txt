 If you want to keep your diary top secret and make sure no one gets inside it, you can add a lock to your journal if it doesn't have one already. If you want to make a diary lock, you will need:


A hole punch
A short piece of ribbon or thin piece of leather (long enough to go all the way around your diary)
Tape
Scissors
A diary lock.
 Do this on the front and the back cover of the book. If you want to close your diary with a lock, you will need these holes to close your diary with a lock later.
 Flip your diary over to the back cover and thread the ribbon through the hole on the back cover first. This way, your lock will close at the front of your diary.
 Tie a knot at the end at the back and cut off any excess ribbon.
 Tape it down, flip the diary over to the front cover, and bring the ribbon over.
 To lock your notebook, thread the ribbon into the hole from inside the cover and out the front. Slide your lock into the loop you have created.


Make sure you keep your key somewhere secure so that only you can find it!

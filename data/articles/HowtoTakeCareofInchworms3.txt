 Inchworms are small and may feed at night, so recognize other signs of infestation, since they may stay out of sight. Look for little holes in the leaves of your trees, bushes, and garden plants. The more you see, the more likely it is that you have a large population of inchworms.Inchworms are commonly attracted to elm, fir, hickory, maple, oak, and pine trees.
Since they also eat fruit, they can often be found in berry bushes and fruit trees., Before you go through the trouble of trying to solve it, decide if it’s really worth the effort. Consider where you found evidence of inchworms, and how pervasive it is. For instance:


Individual inchworms don’t eat much, so if you only find sporadic leaves that seem to be eaten, the population is probably small.If the leaves in question are confined to trees, the trees may offer enough food to support the population without widespread damage.Smaller plant life, like garden plants and bushes, are more at risk, since they offer less material for the inchworms to feed on.
 Lots of small animals feed on inchworms, so encourage their presence. Birds are perhaps the easiest (and preferable) to attract, so hang bird houses and feeders around the affected area. In addition to birds, inchworms are also prey to:Lizards
Yellow jackets
Wasps

, Spray the leaves or the worms directly with insecticides, which are an effective means of dealing with inchworms. Or, if you’re worried about toxins, use a non-toxic remedy. Instead of traditional chemical poison, use a natural pathogen, like bacillus thuringiensis, which you can find online or in garden stores.Bacillus thuringiensis only affects insects, making it an ideal solution for gardens, fruit trees, berry bushes, or other crops.
Treat the area again next spring to eliminate any eggs that may have been fertilized during your last infestation. Different types of inchworm reproduce at different times, but all types hatch in spring.

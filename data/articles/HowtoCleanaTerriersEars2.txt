 Start by warming the liquid cleaner slightly. You can move the bottle back and forth in your hands or place it in a warm place. Next, hold your hand around your dog's ear and place the nozzle of the bottle above it, just over the ear entrance. Gently squeeze the fluid into the ear, pouring enough liquid in to fill the canal.


If you overfill the canal, it won't hurt your dog. It will just spill out onto the floor., Once the ear is full, use one of the cotton balls to plug the entrance. This will help keep the cleaner in during the next step. It should fit down into the ear canal.


Don't push it too far down. You don't want to hurt your dog.Do not use a Q-tip. Dogs have a tendency to move suddenly, which could cause the q-tip to plunge into her ear and cause pain and structural damage., Once the cotton ball is in place, gently rub the bottom of your terrier's ear canal for a minute or two. This will help mix the cleaner with the wax and debris in your terrier's ear canal. The ear canal is the area right under the ear flap. It will feel like a small tube underneath your fingertips.


The exact location doesn't matter as long as you are in the general area., After the ear massage, remove the cotton ball from the ear. Your dog will likely shake her head at this point to get the remaining cleaner out. Once she does, use another cotton ball the gently blot out excess cleaner. Try massaging the ear canal to bring any remaining cleaner to the surface. Your dog will likely shake her head a few times, which is normal.


Look the other direction when she does this. The cleaner may fly out of his ear.
Once she's done shaking her head, repeat on the other ear.
If any discharge you find smells bad, you notice a heavy discharge, or the color is brown or black, take your dog to the vet.

, Melt the butter in a saucepan. When the butter has melted, you take the pan away from the cooking plate and put it aside.
 Mix it on low speed. While itâ€™s mixing, you pour the melted butter into the bowl. When everything is fully blended, you stop the machine.
 Be careful not to mix it for too long. As soon as everything is mixed, you turn off the machine.
 Use it around the edge of the bowl, so that you get as much of the mixture as possible.
,, It can be a good idea to use aluminum foil, and spray it with cooking spray. Pour the batter into the pan and put it into the preheated oven. Bake it for about 25 minutes.
 Then you put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes.

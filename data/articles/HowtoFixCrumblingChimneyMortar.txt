 Use a stiff-bristled scrub brush and a mixture of either regular dish soap or commercial brick cleaner and water to scrub the bricks and joints in the area(s) where you will be re-pointing the mortar. Allow the surface to dry completely before moving on to the next step.


Scrape as much loose mortar out of the joint as possible using a wire brush.
Chip the remainder of the old mortar out of the joint very gently using a hammer and a chisel.
Brush the brick thoroughly with a dry scrub brush to remove any small pieces of mortar and mortar dust.
, Mortar is properly mixed and ready to use when it is moist enough that it holds together without crumbling. Mortar will start to harden, or set up, relatively quickly. Mix it in small batches to avoid having it dry out in the middle of the repair., Repeat this until the entire joint is packed full of new mortar, and the joint is level with the brick., The mortar line should be slightly indented below the surface of the bricks.

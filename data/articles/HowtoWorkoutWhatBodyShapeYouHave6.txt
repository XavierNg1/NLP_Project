 The best feature for the feminine oval body shape tends to be your legs. Wear mid or knee length skirts that are full and flowing, or straight with a flare at the bottom to draw away from the midsection.Avoid skirts that are too short as they can make your torso look bulky.Men should buy straight leg pants. Tight pants can make your torso look bulky while baggy, wide-cut pants can make your legs look bulky.
 When shopping look for wrap tops, v-necks, belted and/or cinched tops, and tops that flare at the bottom.Choose tops that have frills, embroidery, or extra fabric above the bust instead of near the stomach.


Tops that are loose at the hem and reach around your buttocks are especially flattering on this figure. It's helpful if there is a cinch or small belt on the top just under your bust line to give a curvy illusion.
Men can wear well-fitting sports jackets to help broaden their shoulders. Leave the jacket unbuttoned for a waist-slimming effect.
 Dark colors such as black are naturally slimming. Avoid patterns and bright hues. Especially avoid horizontal stripes as they make oval body types appear bulkier than they are. If you want to add a splash of color to your outfit, consider wearing funky jewelry or a brightly colored waist belt. Men can consider wearing a colorful tie.

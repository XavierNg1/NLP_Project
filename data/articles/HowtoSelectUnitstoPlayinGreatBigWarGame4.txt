 Ships are the sea-based transportation and attack units. They are made in the Shipyard. Tap on the Shipyard to see what units are available.


Not all units are available at all times. The units’ availability may depend on the mission, on your Battle Stars, or on your available gold coins.
 There are six different Ship units in the game.


A Scout Boat is used to clear out the fog on the water that blocks portions of the map. It is a non-combat unit.
A Ferry can transport infantry and vehicles quickly across the water. It is a non-combat unit.
A Destroyer is the ultimate anti-ship unit, able to attack and take down all types of ship units. It can only attack ships.
An Aegis is the only ship that can attack airborne units. It can’t attack other types of units though.
A Cruiser is the best ship to attack land-based units, such as infantry and vehicles, able to deliver much damage to them.
A Fleet Oiler resupplies ship units with fresh ammo and fuel. It is a non-combat unit.
 Tap on the unit you want to build, then tap on the “Buy” button with the amount of gold coins need to make it. The selected unit will immediately be generated from the Shipyard, ready for use.


You can only buy a unit that you can afford.

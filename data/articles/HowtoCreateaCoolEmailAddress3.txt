 Ask anyone who knows you well or anyone who you think might be good at naming things. This could be a friend, a relative, or a parent. If you don't like their answers, don't worry about it and try to think of one on your own.


Consider using a username generator, if you don't know anyone who can help you. Run a web search for "username generator", and you may be able to create something suitable.
 The domain of an email address is the "@example.com" part. Any standard email client should be fine, although some domains (like AOL or Hotmail) might come across as a bit dated. Some sites will allow you to choose a custom domain; if you take this route, avoid choosing a long domain, as people might not want to type out a long address. Domains like "@gmail.com" or "@yahoo.com" are short, popular, and easy to remember.
 When you're ready, visit an email client, click whichever variation of "create an account" you find, and proceed to create your very own cool email address. Type the email address you decided on into the proper "username" or "login name" field.

 Going somewhere new and different can make the walk more interesting for both you and your dog. Try driving out to a lake or walking to a park you don't normally go. Even taking a different route in your neighborhood can make it more fun.You could also try walking in a different neighborhood with more interesting houses.;
, Walking is a great time to listen to an audiobook or podcasts. While you don't want to completely disengage from your dog while walking (after all, your job is make sure your dog is safe), you can keep one earbud in to listen to a novel, learn a language, or listen to a podcast about something interesting., Often, when out with your dog, you're likely thinking about what you need to do next week or what's on your work schedule. You're not fully in the moment. Instead, pull yourself out of your head, and take time to actually look at the scenery on your walk.Notice the pretty flowers your neighbor planted. Check out the interesting architecture. Listen to the sounds of the birds and people in the distance.
Taking time to be in the moment will make it more interesting, and it will help give you a much-needed break from stress.
 Another fun activity for a walk is taking photos as you go. Doing so will engage you in your surroundings as you always hunt for the next pretty picture. Plus, you'll likely capture some good shots of your dog being goofy and fun. You can even post a few pictures online after your walk to let others see what you've been up to., Nothing gets your heart pumping like your favorite song. If you have some tunes you love playing in your ears while you're walking, you're likely to walk faster (if they're upbeat) and stay more entertained as you go. Just remember to keep an eye out for your dog. Try just putting one earbud in instead of both of them, so you're still aware of your surroundings.

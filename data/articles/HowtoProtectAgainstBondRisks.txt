 Do some research on the Standard and Poorâ€™s Ratings Service for current bond ratings and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's (MSRB) Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) website. A bond with a rating of Bb or higher has been issued by a company found to be in good credit and financial standing.;
, An issuer that fails to supply information on its current financial status should be considered a high risk.
 Do not place more than ten percent of your total investment funds into one bond. Choose bonds in a range of industries to prevent high losses from one industry's fluctuations.
 These represent higher risk. You might choose just one high-yield bond with a value of less than five percent of your total investment portfolio. Place no more than 15 percent of your total investments into a specific high-yield industry.
 Laddering is a process of holding short-term, medium-term and long-term bonds to protect your funds from changes in interest rates (since the longer the term of a bond, the more sensitive it is to changes in market interest rates). This allows you to continue the ladder strategy by taking the principal of a maturing bond and investing it in a new bond.
 This will lessen the chance that any one risk will hurt you significantly. Choose basic stocks, indexes and exchange-traded funds to create a diversified portfolio.
, A bond's length (measured in years) will correspond to its interest rate sensitivity. The shorter the bond, the lower its interest rate risk.

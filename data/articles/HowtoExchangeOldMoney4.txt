 Third party money changers can often handle notes that some banks will not accept for exchange. Banks sometimes will not accept money from a country that is not frequently visited. Other times, they will not deal with changing an expired currency for a new one.
 Every dealer and currency exchange will make money on the spread. This is the difference between what they pay for a currency and what they sell it for. Because the differences are dramatic at times, search for the best rate and lowest fees by calling and writing down the rates from different dealers. Don't forget to ask about any additional fees.


A dealer should be able to quote you an exchange rate based on the spot price for that currency. Remember currency markets move so the rate today is not necessarily the rate tomorrow.
 If you can't get to a bank in the issuing country, you can contact a third-party company that handles currency redemption. While if you hold old Francs you are out of luck, Lithuanian litas for example are still convertible into Euros.Companies like Travelex specialize in changing currencies.Several companies of this type exist to provide redemption for defunct currency. These companies work by buying old money from customers at a low rate and exchanging it in bulk with national banks. The Currency Commission is one such company.
Using this type of service will provide a lower rate for your exchange, but may be your only option once the issuing government's exchange deadline has passed.
 If the currency is past its deadline, there may not be any option for exchanging. Sometimes collectors may have interest if it is rare, otherwise you may just have some nicely decorated paper. Check eBay to see if it has any value to anyone.

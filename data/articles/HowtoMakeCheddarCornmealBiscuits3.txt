 Turn the dough out on to a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough until it just holds together, or about ten times., Once you are done kneading the dough, pat it out on the generously floured surface. You should end up with a circular shape that is about ¾ inch or 2 centimeters thick. Make sure the dough’s thickness is as uniform as possible., To cut the biscuits, you will need a 3 inch or 7.5 centimeter cookie cutter. If you do not have a cookie cutter, you can use a glass or cup instead. Use the cutter, cup, or glass to cut the biscuits. Transfer them to an ungreased cookie sheet, spacing them about 1 inch or 2.5 centimeters apart.After cutting the biscuits, combine the scraps, pat them to the desired thickness, and cut the remaining biscuits.
 Place the baking sheet on the middle rack of the preheated oven. Bake the biscuits for about 18 minutes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit or 218 degrees Celsius. The biscuits will be golden brown when done. Remove from oven., Once you remove the biscuits from the oven, place them on a wire cooling rack. Cool the biscuits for at least 5 minutes before serving. Enjoy!


Biscuits are best enjoyed immediately, as they will lose their original texture when stored for more than twelve hours.
Store leftover biscuits by wrapping them in foil or plastic wrap, or placing them in a sealed plastic bag.

 Pour water into the bottom part of a double boiler, and pour the wax flakes into the top. Place the boiler over medium high heat and allow the wax flakes to slowly melt, stirring periodically until all the lumps are gone.









If you don't have a double boiler, make one using a large pot and a slightly smaller pot that fits inside. Fill the larger pot with a few inches of water and place the smaller pot inside. Pour the wax flakes into the smaller pot and heat the boiler over medium high heat to allow the wax flakes to melt.
You can also use an electric wax melter, available for sale at craft stores.
 When the wax is completely melted, add a few drops of color and fragrance. A little color and fragrance goes a long way, so use them sparingly, check the color and scent, and add a few more drops if desired.
 Remove the pot containing the wax from heat. Lift the wick-wrapped pencil above the first container, unwrapping it slightly if necessary, and pour wax into the container. Fill the container to just below the rim. Re-wrap the pencil so that the wick is taut and centered, and rest the pencil across the rim of the container. Repeat with the remaining containers.









The melted wax should look clear, and it should be easy to pour. If it starts to turn opaque, that means it's getting hard. You may need to reassemble the double boiler and reheat the wax.

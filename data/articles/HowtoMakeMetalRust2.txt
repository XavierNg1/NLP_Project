 Peroxide can be dangerous if too much is inhaled at a time. Choose a piece of metal that is either iron or tin--both will work with this method.
 The spray bottle will make it much easier to apply to your metal. Spray your piece of metal with a sizeable amount of peroxide. Spraying more peroxide will help to speed up the rusting process., You should do this while the peroxide is still wet. The rusting process will begin almost immediately and is actually easy to see. You can pour on more or less salt depending on how thick or crusty you want the rust to be., Let your metal air dry. If you wipe of the salt while the peroxide is still wet, you will disrupt the rusting process and cause your rust to come out blotchy. Once dry, rub the salt off and admire your work.
 While you have just read about the basic way you can use peroxide and salt to cause metal to rust, the sky is really the limit when it comes to this technique. Rub the salt off and then spray the piece with peroxide again. Try different amounts of salt or dip your metal into water once it has dried. The water will give the rust a smoother texture.

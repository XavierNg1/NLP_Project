 Get one that also covers the screen if it won't bug you (not all covers cover the screen). This is one of the easiest ways to prevent scratches. However, many are expensive for just getting a cover.;
, Many docks for the iPod will not allow the iPod to fit on the dock with a cover on. This is one of the few times you can take out your iPod.
 It's your iPod. You should be in control of how others use it. Tell your friends and family that you don't want your iPod getting scratched and don't take it out of it's cover. If you want an easy way for others to remember your rules, put them in the notes of your iPod.
 If you haven't bought an iPod already, consider one that doesn't get scratched as easily such as a Nano or a Shuffle. Even though they lack some features of internet connectivity, touch screen or a screen altogether, they do have their benefits such as they're cheaper, smaller and don't have shiny chrome backing so they don't get scratched as easily.

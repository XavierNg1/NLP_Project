 A brutality is different from a heroic brutality. Also, it is a very hard to accomplish, it's a 11 button combo!, and isn't that satisfying. Find out if a brutality is even attempt able on one of your MK games. Try to be able to do a fatality or a hara-kiri before even trying this or else the chances of failure outweigh you. After reading over this continue.
 start with simple combos, then go into special moves, then into the large combos, and try to complete every large combo your character has.
 practice it in parts, and try to add another button as you get better.
 Keep doing it, until you get it!

 Consider using your expensive yarn for trimming and accent areas. Use a cheaper yarn in a more muted color for the majority of the project. Consider looser knits and lace designs. A nice shawl or knee blanket doesn't need to be overly thick or warm and could use a lot less yarn.
 If you have a stash of knitting supplies, take inventory. You may be surprised at how many hats, scarves, mittens, and baby sweaters you can make without buying anything.


Look up "one skein projects" in knitting books and websites to find efficient designs.
 Learn how to switch to a different strand of yarn between stitches. This lets you turn that tiny ball of yarn into part of a larger project, instead of the world's smallest sock. Explore stripes and creative color combinations while you're at it.


Switch at the end of a row whenever possible. This leaves a small knot behind, which is less obvious on the edge of the project.
Use this similar technique while crocheting.
 Scrumbles are freeform knitting or crotchet projects made entirely out of bits and pieces. The only goal is to make a colorful, tactile object and to have fun doing it. One approach is to turn each little bit of yarn into squares, shells, or curves, then attach all the bits to each other.
 Save money on party decorations with this quick technique. All you need is the tail end of a yarn ball, a pair of scissors, and a minute of your time.
 Once you pick up the mitered square technique, you can turn any pile of scrap into a square. Repeat that enough times, and you'll transform a whole box of scrap yarn into a complete blanket.
 Yarn bombing is a harmless form of woolen graffiti. Decorate public benches, fence railings, or telephone poles with colorful yarn wrappers. Since these are temporary, outdoor art pieces, you can use the cheapest yarn available.
 The tiniest scraps of yarn can become stuffing for animal toys. You can use it to fluff up your kid's worn down favorites, or to make your own stuffed animals.

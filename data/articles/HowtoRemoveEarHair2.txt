 Laser hair removal uses a laser beam to target and destroy dark hair follicles, leaving your skin nearly hairless. Look online for popular laser hair removal services in your area and look for reviews of the clinics offering them. Call to ask about possible treatments for removing your ear hair, and get pricing information so you can comparison-shop between clinics.Ask clinics what financing options they offer (e.g. monthly payments).
Make sure that the laser hair removal is done by an experienced doctor with a relevant specialty, like dermatology or cosmetic surgery., Because laser hair removal works in sequence with your hair growth cycle, a specific schedule of treatments will have to be established for effective hair removal. Make time for 4-6 sessions, held about a month apart, which is the standard procedure for most patients. Note that given the small area that ear hair covers, ear hair removal sessions should last only a short time., To protect your skin and ensure the results of your laser treatments, avoid the sun for approximately 6 weeks before your first appointment. Getting a lot of sun can greatly increase the risk of skin lightening during treatment. Keep your ears protected by wearing a wide brimmed hat outdoors before and during your hair removal sessions, or by applying sunscreen with a high SPF to your ears.

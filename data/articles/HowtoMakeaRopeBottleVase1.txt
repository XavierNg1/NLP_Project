 The vase or glass bottle doesn't have to be glass or clear, as you will be covering it with rope and cord. Take into consideration the vase or bottle size as compared to the amount of rope and cord you will ultimately need.


Consider using an old soda or beer bottle as your “vase” if you don’t have a vase you can transform. Nearly any bottle that can be used to hold flowers or plants can be used for this project.;
, Depending on how you plan to design the vase you may only want a splash of cord color so determine the amount of cord as compared to rope.


Bring the vase or bottle (if possible) with you when choosing the rope and cord. This will allow you to determine the amount and style of rope and cord.
 Make sure you have plenty of glue sticks on hand for quick additions if needed.

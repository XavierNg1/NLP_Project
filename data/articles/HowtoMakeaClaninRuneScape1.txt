 Take time to answer these questions:


What sort of players would you like in your clan (e.g. mature, obsessed with Runescape, laid-back, funny)?



 



What do you want your clan to do? (e.g. train skills or one particular skill, fight boss monsters, play activities, go player killing)?






Do you want all of your members to be in the same or similar timezones for organization's sake?







How big do you want your clan to be? Remember that while great big clans may be more powerful and make citadel-building easier, smaller clans feel more like a family, and if you are going for a community-focused clan, you might be better off with a low player-count. Small clans may not have a lot of power, but they can still fight.

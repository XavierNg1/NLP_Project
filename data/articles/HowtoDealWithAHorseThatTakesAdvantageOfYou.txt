 If there is a particular section of path that your horse bolts through, or a tree that your horse shies away from, try conquering their possible fear of that object or place by making it more common. If it is an object, show them the object every day in a calm manner to allow them to get used to it.;
, If the horse is bolting or rearing with you, then that can be considered more serious than a horse waiting for you to ask twice or three times before making a transition into trot.
 Something more serious will require you to enlist the help of an experienced trainer or instructor whereas something more trivial could be solved by yourself.
 If the problem was that the horse wasn't listening to a leg aid then use a whip after first asking to make it clear that you want them to go forward. If the horse passes a previously scary object give them a treat as a reward.
 If you become irate the horse will take your anger or fear as signal to be afraid and due to their impulse to flee danger the horse may become flighty and pose a bigger risk to both itself and you.
 You need to tell him in some way that you are the big man, and that they should be listening to you. If the horse walks in front of you repeatedly, lightly yank his halter at first. If this keeps happening, yank his halter harder and back him up. This shows the horse that you are in control. This varies depending on your situation, but the horse should always know that you are the boss.

 Keeping your hands underneath provides back support and balance for this exercise.
 Don't lock your knees, which cuts off the blood flood flow in your legs. Hold this position as you inhale.
 Hold them there and breathe. Repeat.









For a variation on this exercise, you can scissor your legs when they're in the down position, adding a cardio and leg-toning element to this work out. Spread your legs in a "V" and bring them back together, first with the left foot over the right, and then the right foot over the left. Try six scissors per set of ten reps to start out with.

 Cover is important so using trees and other barriers is something to consider. You will even need cover when you are advancing if your team is on the offense.;
,


An effective tactic is to pour water on top of your snow forts. The water will then freeze and form an ice layer which will strengthen your barricade even further.
Keep a stash of snowballs at your fort or base area to use in an emergency.
 If you're playing with a group try to get an opponent singled out and focus your snowballing efforts, split up and attack from different directions.
 Act like you are retreating, but have reinforcements waiting behind a hill or trees, and lead the enemy right to them!

, If you keep retreating, your team will be confined to a small area and surrounded. Hold your ground, and have a huge pile of snowballs with you.

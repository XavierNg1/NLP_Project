 The only way to transfer music to your Xbox 360's hard drive is to rip it directly from an audio CD. There are other ways to stream music (see below sections), but this is the only way to actually copy the files.


It must be an audio CD. Data CDs/DVDs or audio DVDs will not work.
You can burn your own music to a blank CD to create a custom audio CD, and then use that CD to copy the music to your Xbox 360. See this guide for details on burning your own audio CD.;
, The Music Player should open automatically, but if it doesn't, press the Xbox button to open the Dashboard. Scroll to the Music tab, select "My Music Apps", and then select Music Player.
 Select "Current Disc" from the menu and then press Down on your controller's D-Pad to highlight the "Rip CD" option.
 Press Right on the D-Pad to select which songs on the CD you want to rip. By default, all songs on the CD are selected.
 Press Left on the D-Pad and select Rip CD with the A button. The songs will begin to be copied to your Xbox 360's hard drive. This process may take a few minutes, and CDs with more music will take longer.
 In the Music Player, select your Xbox's hard drive as the location and then select the tracks you want to listen to. You can use the music on your hard drive to replace the soundtracks of games that support it by opening the Music Player while in a game.

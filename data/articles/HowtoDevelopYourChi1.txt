 To properly work on your breathing, it needs to be your main focus – not on how uncomfortable your legs are, or how you want to hang a picture on the wall you’re staring at. Choose between a chair and a pillow on the floor – whichever would be most comfortable is the best choice.


In a chair, sit with your back straight, your feet flat on the ground, and knees shoulder width apart.
On the floor, choose either a cross-legged position or kneeling.;
, Pay attention to breathing in and out. Make sure you are using your diaphragm, not just your chest. Breathing from your diaphragm (lower in your body, close to your stomach) allows you to get more air both in and out. Cycling a lot of air through your body is essential to developing your chi. Keep doing this exercise over the course of days and weeks until it becomes natural. Then you can begin to attempt this style of breathing wherever you might be to help get your energy flowing., It’s difficult to keep your mind neutral and away from thinking about anything and everything. But for the 5-10 minutes that you are practicing breathing, try to just focus on that. The in and the out are like the yin and yang – opposites, yet interconnected.
 Not actually breathing in the physical shape, breathing in a square is for after you have mastered the basic breathing from the diaphragm. Put yourself into your comfortable seated position to begin. To breathe in a square:Breathe in
Hold your breath for 5 seconds
Breathe out

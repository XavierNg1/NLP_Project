 Slowly sprinkle 5 tablespoons (40 g) of all-purpose flour over the mushroom mixture and stir so it’s well incorporated. Allow the mixture to cook on medium heat for about 3 minutes to get rid of the raw flour taste.Stir the mixture occasionally so it cooks to avoid scorching.
 After you’ve gotten rid of the floury taste, slowly add the chicken stock and mushroom soaking liquid mixture to the skillet. Use a whisk to blend the liquid in as you pour so it’s well blended.Whisk the mixture slowly and steadily to prevent any lumps from forming.
 Once the chicken stock mixture is incorporated, add 1 cup (240 ml) of whole milk and ½ cup (120 ml) of heavy cream to the skillet. Raise the heat to medium high, and bring the mixture to a boil.To keep the sauce smooth, whisk it occasionally as you’re bringing it to a boil.
 After the sauce has a reached a boil, lower the heat to low and allow it to simmer until it becomes thick and smooth. Typically, that takes about 10 to 15 minutes.You should whisk the sauce every so often while it’s cooking to keep it smooth and lump-free.

 There is no way to buy your way into this type of title.


The Prime Minister can nominate someone for a life peerage, and if the Queen agrees with this nomination, that person will receive a title on appointment. Those who receive this title usually receive it for exemplary service to the country, and the title cannot be inherited by future generations.
Law lords must be recommended by the Lord Chancellor, nominated by the Prime Minister, and appointed by the Queen. To become a lord in this manner, you'll need to become a judge in the court of appeals first. This title cannot be inherited by future generations, either.
Bishops and archbishops can also become Members of the House of Lords. There are 26 seats open for these religious officials, and when one retires, the newly opened seat is passed to the most senior bishop without a title.
 Lords with inherited titles do not become Members of the House of Lords, but receiving a title in this manner is more welcome among the aristocracy than purchasing your title as Lord of the Manor.


These titles are typically passed onto the eldest son in a family, but if the family has daughters and no sons, you could obtain the lordship title by marrying one of the daughters of the current entitled lord.

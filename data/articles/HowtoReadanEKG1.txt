 It's one of the simplest and oldest cardiac investigations available, yet it can provide a wealth of useful information and remains an essential part of the assessment of cardiac patients.The paper printout is usually available right after the test. Sometimes you might not get the printout for a few days.


When you go in your first time, the process can be a bit unnerving. Sticky stuff will get rubbed over different parts of your body and leads will be attached at different angles to view your heart. These are tracking the electrical activity of your heart; if the activity is moving toward the tracker, the lines will go up (this is called "positive deflection"); if the activity is moving away from the tracker, the lines will go down (this is called "negative deflection"). You'll see the movements on the graph paper when it's finished.;
, Voltage is measured along the vertical axis; time is measured along the horizontal axis in squares. There are large squares that are divided into smaller squares.


Small squares are 1 mm across and represent 0.04 seconds. The large squares measure 5 mm across and represent 0.2 seconds.
10 mm in height is equal to 1mV in voltage.
 This is known as the P wave, which is the straight line between the dips and spikes. Normal duration is between 0.12 to 2.0 seconds which is 3 to 4 small horizontal boxes.


This amount of time should be pretty consistent across the entire strip. If there is a varied amount of time (boxes) between beats, it can indicate an irregular heartbeat. This is only something to worry about if your doctor says so--it can be completely harmless.
That little bump afterward is known as the "T wave"--it finishes off the heartbeat, repolarizing the ventricles.

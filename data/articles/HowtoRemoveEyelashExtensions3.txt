 Eyelash extensions are most often affixed using glues that contain cyano acrylate, otherwise known as superglue. This type of glue is extremely difficult to remove without the proper tools and chemical solution. Return to your eyelash extension if you want to remove your eyelashes for any of the following reasons:


Most of your extensions have grown out, and you have a few left that you'd like to remove. You should be able to return to the salon and have these taken out quickly, and usually free of charge.
You aren't happy with the way you look in eyelash extensions. If you have a whole set of extensions that need to be removed, it's much better to go back to your technician instead of trying to remove them yourself.
A few days have passed since you got the extensions and you're experiencing a pricking sensation. Sometimes one or two extensions get stuck together, or the same extension is glued to more than one natural lash. This is usually easy to resolve, but it requires a trip back to your technician.
 Sometimes new technicians or people without training make mistakes when applying eyelash extensions. Go to a different, well-reputed salon to get your extensions removed if you are experiencing the following problems:


Your eyelash extensions don't look professional. If they're crooked, patchy, or just not attractive, go to someone you can trust to have them fixed. You don't want to complicate the problem by accidentally damaging your natural lashes.
You are experiencing a lot of pain around your eyelashes. If the glue used to apply eyelash extensions is applied improperly, it can pull at the skin and cause severe pain around the eyes. Instead of going back to the person who applied the extensions this way, put yourself in better hands for the removal process.

 Unlike some types of footwear that can be stored easily in plastic containers, suede requires exposure to air. When storing the boots in a closet, slip them into cotton pillowcases. The cotton will promote air circulation while also protecting the boots from the accumulation of dust., Don't leave suede boots exposed to direct sunlight when they are not in use. Excessive exposure to the light will cause fading, while long periods of exposure to humidity will trigger dampness that could eventually become mildew. Store them in a clothes or linen closet, where they will remain cool and dry.Avoid storing your boots somewhere that could become warm and/or humid, such as a bathroom, garage or basement.
 Even if you've taking excellent care of the suede boots and they appear to be clean, have them cleaned anyway. Doing so will remove any minute traces of dirt that you may have overlooked and prevent the development of mold or mildew while they are in storage. Go to or call a dry cleaning service in your area to find out if they will clean your boots.

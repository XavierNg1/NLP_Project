  You should be able to land straight-airs while riding switch.;
,,  You may do some set-up turns before hitting the jump, but once you're on the ramp, make sure you're heading straight.
  Be sure not to turn (i.e., keep going in a straight line!), just apply a small amount of toe-side pressure. The 180 is a small rotation, so you don't need to load the rotation before you leave the lip as some people do with larger rotations.
  Your first split-second after leaving the lip should feel like a straight air. Turn 90 degrees towards your backside (clockwise for regular, counterclockwise for goofy), keeping your knees sucked up as high as you can. Tip #1: just after you pop off the lip, keep looking straight for a split second. This will help give you a sense of the trajectory of the jump and the timing of your landing so that you're not flying through the air entirely blind.
 If you kept looking straight the split second after you left the lip, you should have some sense of the timing of the jump (how long you should be in the air before landing). Tip #2: Hold your rotation at 90 degrees for a split second. This will give you more control over your rotation so you can dictate when to put the landing gear down (versus having inertia dictate the rotation).
,  For starters, it will help to land slightly on your toes to avoid either washing out or over-rotating.
 It helps to imagine putting your butt down.

 Typically during an inspection the agent will have a digital copy of the registration you have submitted to the AKC and will want to check that these match your individual records. For instance, they may ask you questions about a specific litter and want to know the number of puppies, breeding and sale dates, names of buyers, and registration numbers.In order to help keep records you can use the kennel management software provided by the AKC or download printable forms from the AKC website.

 It is also important to have individual records for each adult dog that you own, breed, or show. For example, you will need to know their registration information, any litters they have produced, medical records, awards etc. The inspector will likely ask you a few questions about a particular dog to ensure that your records match with the ones you have provided them.If you co-own a dog with another breeder, you will need to check in regularly to make sure that all of your records concerning that dog are up to date.
 Record keeping is very important to the AKC because this helps to ensure that the breed standard is maintained over time. For example, your records should include the history and lineage of each dog. This information is crucial to the AKC because it is used to ensure that purebreds remain pure which can help to protect against genetic diseases.If you have more than one breed at your facility, you will need to keep track of each lineage separately.

 A new study done on empathy in dogs notes that dogs may yawn as a way to emotionally respond to someone that they are emotionally attached to, such as their owner. The researchers concluded that dogs will yawn in response to a real yawn from their owner to identify with their actions and express empathy.Test your dog’s ability to empathize with you by sitting in front of her and letting out a real yawn. Note if she yawns back at you, as this could be a sign of empathy.
 The next time you are upset, stressed out, or in a distressing situation, note how your household pet responds to you. Your dog may go over to you and lick you or nuzzle you as a sign of empathy or your cat may try to sit in your lap or rub against you to show that she is aware of your distress. These actions are indicators that your animal is able to identify and respond to your emotional state., Another key element of empathy is the ability to be self-aware, and researchers are currently testing the capacity for self-awareness in animals. You can do this on your own by placing your animal, such as a cat or dog, in front of a mirror and noting how they react to the mirror. If your cat or dog tries to paw or lick at their reflection, they may not be aware that they are looking at themselves in the mirror and may be believe they are seeing another cat or dog.You can test the animal’s capacity for self-awareness further by making a small mark in washable marker on the animal’s face. You can then note if the animal tries to rub off the mark on their face when they look in the mirror or if they ignore it completely. If they ignore it completely, this may be a sign that the animal is not self-aware and not able to respond to his own reflection.

 A one year old is likely to already have and additionally receive an abundance of toys, so it’s fine to pick out a gift based on sentiment more than play. Since you’re celebrating how quickly this little one is sprouting up, a month-by-month photo collage or a personalized growth chart will probably touch the parents’ hearts.If you feel guilty about buying something the kid won’t immediately appreciate, tie a small rattle or other toy to the ribbon on the package, and the child will be plenty happy too.
 Whether it be a photo frame or album, towel or blanket, or t-shirt or travel bag, you can get pretty much any type of gift personalized with a child’s initials, full name, or any other type of message. Some personalized gifts may be targeted toward future appreciation, while others can be more immediately useful.For instance, labeled sippy cups, bowls, bibs, or bath towels will probably come in handy right away, and may be particularly appreciated if there is more than one child in the house.
 Especially if you’re sure the child is going to be buried in new toys anyway, there’s no shame in choosing a gift they’ll appreciate years from now. You can create a small but sturdy “time capsule” box and fill it with trinkets, mementos, clippings, photos, and a letter from you that represent the child’s first year. Mark it “Do not open until 20xx” (when the child is 16, 18, 21, 30, etc.)., A savings bond placed in the child's name can serve as another type of "time capsule," and one that the kid may be even more eager to "open" in seventeen years or so. Also, if you feel awkward about giving cash for a one year old's birthday, this can feel more tangible and personalized.


Take some time to read over the procedures and regulations regarding purchasing a savings bond (or other investment product) in a minor child's name.

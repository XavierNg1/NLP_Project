 If the symptoms do not subside within a few hours, consider seeking urgent medical advice. Though it's not a life or death situation, make the call, even if only for advice. The ER doctor most likely will give the patient Valium or Xanax and possibly a Beta-Blocker like Atenolol to calm the heart and the adrenaline in the body.


If this is the first time he or she has had a panic attack, they may want to seek medical attention because they are frightened of what is happening to them. If they've had panic attacks in the past, however, they may know that getting emergency care will worsen their state. Ask them. This decision will ultimately depend on the individual's experience and your interactions with him or her.
 Panic attacks are a form of anxiety that should be treated by a medical professional. A good therapist should be able to pinpoint the panic attack triggers or, at the very least, help the individual get a better grasp on the physiological side of the situation. If they do begin it, allow them to proceed at their own pace.


Let them know that therapy is not for kooks. It is a legitimate form of help that millions of people are a part of. What's more, a therapist may prescribe a medication that halts the problem in its tracks. The medication may not stop the attacks completely, but will surely lower the amount and frequency of them.
 You may feel incredibly guilty that you are the one freaking out during a friend's panic attack, but this is normal. Know that being alarmed and a bit scared is a healthy response to witnessing one of these episodes. If it'd help, ask the person if you can talk about it later, so you can handle it better in the future.

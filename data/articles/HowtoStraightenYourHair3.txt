 The water content will cause your hair to curl back up or frizz immediately. Do use a hair spray if you live in a humid area, however. Your hair will be prone to frizz due to the added moisture in the air.
 Rain will undo all your hard work and leave you with a frizzy mess. Also, remember to carry a headband with you in the summer to keep the perspiration from your bangs. If you are jogging or walking, consider putting your hair up in a ponytail.
 Even if you love the straight look, a curling iron can be used to flick out the ends of your hair or flick the front sections away from your face.
 Don't worry though, all you have to do is repeat the straightening process again! Just don't straighten your hair too much, as it will cause your hair to become dry and damaged. Try to save the straight look for special occasions!

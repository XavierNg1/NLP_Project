 Squeeze the left clutch lever while slowly releasing your hand on the throttle. This will allow the bike to shift up into higher gears.
 With the clutch still depressed, push up with your left toe on the shift lever. This will put the bike into the next highest gear.
 Gradually release the clutch while rotating your wrist backward on the throttle. Again, you shouldn't give the bike too much throttle, or you may lose control of it. If you did everything correctly, you will have upshifted into the next highest gear.

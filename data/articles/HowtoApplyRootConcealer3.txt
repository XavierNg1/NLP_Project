 Some brands come in a loose powder form, along with a big fluffy brush that looks a lot like a makeup brush you would use to apply blush. Other powder formulas come in palettes that are situated into compacts, similar in appearance to eyeshadow palettes. The palette style concealers come with small, stiff applicator brushes.Powder formulas allow for a very precise application, which is a big plus for many users.
However, if you have a significant amount of regrowth, powder may not be the best option, since this formula takes longer to apply.
 When using a powder formula, you definitely want to start with clean, dry hair that has already been styled.Start with a small amount of the concealer until you know how your product performs on your hair. Place the loaded applicator brush on your roots and softly brush the powder into your hair.
 Keep dabbing and brushing at your roots until the powder blends in. Take a look at the results. Powder formulas are very buildable and blend easily, so if you need more concealer, load your applicator brush again and repeat until you are satisfied with the results.Set with hairspray, if desired.

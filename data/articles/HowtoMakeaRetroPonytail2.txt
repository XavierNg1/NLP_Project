If necessary, use bobby pins to keep the rat and bangs in place while you work on the rest of the ponytail., Remove your back hair from the ponytail. Take a curling iron. Allow it to heat up and then curl your hair in individual strands. The number of strands is up to you. The higher the number of strands, the curlier your hair will be., Once your hair is curled, gather your hair into a ponytail. Use an elastic band to seal your ponytail., Take a large, thick ribbon. Tie it around the elastic band to conceal it. Tie it into a bow for a cute effect somewhat reminiscent of the '50s or '60s.

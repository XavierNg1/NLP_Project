 Go to downloads in Scala's website and download their current version of Scala. Make sure to download the one that supports your operating system.;
, Install the downloaded application like every other application by just accepting their terms and conditions and by making sure to save it in a new folder.
 Regardless of the operating system you're using, open the terminal and make sure to change the directory to where you've installed the downloaded Scala application.

For example, if you're using a PC and if you've installed your application on the D drive, make sure to change the directory to D before proceeding any further.
 Type Scala or scala in the terminal and you should see some information about the version of your application pop up. You're now ready to run small Scala programs.
 You can now write and run Scala code in the terminal or run it by writing it externally in the terminal.

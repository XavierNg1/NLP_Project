In the United States, the government mandates that water utilities regularly perform a series of tests on the water. The testing results are published in the Consumer Confidence Report, which you can get from your water utility.
Other locations and countries may have similar testing requirements. Contact your water supplier for more information.



To read your report, consult the guide that will come with it. Based on the results of this testing you can call the EPA hotline number you'll find in the report to inquire about measures being taken to ensure the quality of your water if the report reflects a dangerous level of contaminates.

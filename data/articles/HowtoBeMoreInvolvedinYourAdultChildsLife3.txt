 Adult children need boundaries so that they can be themselves and grow. You may only see them once a week, or in some cases less. There may even be some topics (e.g. romantic relationships or raising their own children) that are off limits. Respect these boundaries if you want to be more involved in your adult child’s life., Your adult child may not date or marry the person that you want them to. This is a fact that you have to accept as a parent. You also have to make room for the person that they do love, and respect the fact that they will often put that person first. Never give an ultimatum or make it a competition between a significant other and yourself., Your adult children still need your support sometimes. Whether they are in a financial hard spot, or they need someone to reassure them that they are good at something, you are still their parent. Offer them love and support whenever they need it.Do not allow yourself to be abused by an adult child for monetary reasons.
 Sometimes, adult children are unwilling to ask for help when they need it. Whether they are in financial trouble or just need someone to babysit for a night, you can find creative ways to offer your help without hurting their pride. However, don’t be offended if they turn down your offer.


For example, if your child won’t accept money when they are in a financial bind, maybe you can ease the burden by taking your grandkids out to buy school clothes.

 For taking notes on science labs, you may want to begin by outlining the experiment. Be sure each lab has its own page. The most important thing is to take notes in real time, so you do not miss any information or remember it incorrectly later. If possible, draw illustrations and graphs to visually represent information that does not come across well with words.
 The main key to math notes is to outline the steps. Write down, in detail, what you should do at each step and why you should do it. Make note of when things didnâ€™t work and illustrate with equations whenever possible. When you have found the final solution and correct methods, outline these for future reference.
 For art assignments, you may wish to take visual notes of your creation process. This will help you think through your work, rather than wasting time or supplies on ideas that will go nowhere. It will also help you see gaps in your ideas and presentation, as well as lead you to think critically about what you like and why it appeals to you.


Do sketches of possible layouts and compositions. Mark the best aspects of each and eliminate what doesn't work. Take note of compositions of other works you enjoy or that fit with what you are working on. Make note of what it is about those compositions that make the original work so effective.
Make lists of themes or topics you wish to depict. If your piece is going have a larger message to it, take notes about what exactly you want it to say and how you intend to get your message across. If the art is commercial in nature, test out copy and branding in your notes before incorporating it into final design.

 Crafting items can level you overall, but it will also level your skills in that crafting specialty. This is useful for getting experience and the skills necessary to make quality items (that you can sell!). There are a number of different crafting skills to try, including weapon smithing, armorsmithing, and alchemy.
 The harder the enemies you fight, the more XP you'll get when you kill them. As such, if you're getting into higher levels and you see those wolves aren't really leveling your skills anymore, you'll know it's time to move on to something a little bigger. Quest time!

, Some less well-balanced MMOs allow other people to steal your kills, but not so in ESO. Since you don't need to worry about stealing someone's kill, you should feel free to help out others in battles. If you help enough, you'll get a little XP. If you really work together, you can split the XP evenly!, You can get buffs (or bonuses to your normal leveling rate) through a few different means. The easiest is to find a Mundus Stone (like the standing stones in Skyrim or birth-signs in Oblivion) which will increase the stat you wish to level. These are located across Tamriel and you will need to seek them out.

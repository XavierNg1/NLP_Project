 Turn the oven on to 400 degrees F (200 C). Get out a baking sheet and spray it with cooking spray. This will prevent the garlic knots from sticking. Set the sheet aside while you make the garlic knots.If you don't have cooking spray, you could use a pastry brush to lightly oil the sheet.;
, Melt 1/4 cup (55 g) unsalted butter in a small bowl and stir in 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan, 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley flakes, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.You can set the mixture aside while you roll the knots.
 Open one 16-ounce (462 g) tube of refrigerated buttermilk biscuits. Cut each of the 8 biscuits in half, so you get 16 pieces of dough. Roll each piece of dough into a rope that's 5-inches (13 cm) long. Tie the rope into a simple knot and tuck the ends under. Repeat this for each piece of dough.Don't worry if the knots don't look perfect. As long as they're formed into a rough knot-shape, they'll bake up well.
 Set the knots of dough on the prepared baking sheet. Dip a pastry brush into the garlic butter mixture and spread it over each knot.You won't use all of the garlic butter mixture. Save the rest for brushing on the knots after they've baked.
 Put the baking sheet in the oven and bake the garlic knots for 8 to 10 minutes. Once the knots are golden brown, carefully remove them from the oven and brush them with the rest of the garlic butter mixture.Serve the garlic knots right away or cool them on a wire rack. Store the cooled knots in an airtight container for several days.

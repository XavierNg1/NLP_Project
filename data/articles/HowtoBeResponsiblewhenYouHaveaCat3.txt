 Your cat should visit the vet at least once per year to ensure that all vaccines are up to date and to examine its overall health. Vaccinations can prevent your cat from developing fatal diseases, such as distemper, rabies, feline leukemia, pneumonitis, and viral rhinotracheitis., This will help control cat populations and can positively impact your catâ€™s behaviour. Cats are less likely to spray urine after being spayed or neutered and in many instances cats will become more affectionate and less aggressive following this surgery.You should have your cat desexed anytime over the age of six month.
 Even though your cat will remain indoors, there is always the chance that it could slip out and get lost when you open the door. To avoid losing your cat, make sure it wears an identification tag at all times. Alternatively, you can have your cat microchipped. This way your cat can be returned to your address if found.

 Pulling an all-nighter is risky business. While most college students think that studying all night will help them learn more for an exam, all-nighters can actually damage grades. Exhausted students can't concentrate on exams, and cramming for a final can actually reduce the amount of information you remember. Well-rested students, on the other hand, are much more relaxed and alert when it comes time to take exams. Make time to sleep -- you'll thank yourself later.


Cramming isn't worth it. This is known as a "freshman trick," meaning that good, veteran students learn very quickly that it is futile. What you may gain from extra study time won't compensate for the loss of alertness and ability to concentrate due to lack of sleep.
 Not only is this good for your body, it's good for your mind, too. It’ll be more difficult to concentrate if you’re hungry. Don’t eat anything that may upset your stomach, though.


Avoid the temptation to hype yourself up on caffeine. It may just make your more anxious. Stick to your normal breakfast -- your routine will be comforting.
 It may sound like a load of baloney, but being confident and thinking you'll do well can help calm you down and, ultimately, make you do well. And let's be honest, you've done what you could. So whatever makes you think you've got it, do it. It'll pay off when you're not breaking out in a sweat, fingers twitching in nerves


When we intend to remember without having confidence that we can remember, the intention is weakened into mere hoping. The memory strengthens as you lay burdens upon it and becomes trustworthy as you trust it. Try to form the habit early on of relying on your memory before referring to your written reminders.

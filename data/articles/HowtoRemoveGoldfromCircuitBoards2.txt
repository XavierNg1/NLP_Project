 Be sure to wear a face mask, safety glasses, and industrial gloves to avoid breathing in the fumes released by the burning plastic. Use steel tongs to turn over the burning circuit boards.
 Break the boards into smaller pieces so they burn faster.
 Pour a bit of gasoline over the pieces to put the pieces on fire. Turn the burning pieces over using steel tongs, and wait until the boards are burnt black.
 Allow the pieces to cool down a littleâ€”just warm enough so you can touch them, but not too cooled down that the plastic hardens again.
 The burning process should have made the board materials brittle and easy to break.


To be safe, wear protective gloves when breaking off the plastic.

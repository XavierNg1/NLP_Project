 The glaze needs to be used as soon as it has been prepared., Warm over a medium-warm heat until the jam melts. Stir occasionally to prevent it from burning., Add the lemon juice and stir through the sieved jam.

The sieving process can be skipped if you've used clear apricot jam.
 Bring to the boil and boil for half a minute. Remove the jam from the heat immediately., Once the apricot jam has cooled a little, it can be added to a cake to form a glaze. Apply with a clean pastry or silicone brush, brushing over the top of the cake. Marzipan, fondant or royal icing can be added after the glaze.

 Lowlights can also neutralize brassy orange tones by introducing darker blonde shades into the mix, creating an overall cooling effect. It’s a procedure best performed by an experienced hair stylist, so lowlighting isn't the cheapest solution.


However, the results can be very striking and it’s certainly something to consider if you’ve tried a lot of other things with no success.As with all “permanent” dyes, lowlights may start to fade after about 6-8 weeks.
 Demi-permanent toners are less damaging to the hair shaft than the permanent variety, with results typically lasting about 6 weeks. Permanent toners will give you about 8 weeks of results. To use, separate your hair into 4 large sections. Work with one section at a time, leaving the other 3 clipped up out of the way.


Apply the toner in small sections, starting at the top and working your way down to the ends until you have full coverage.
Keep a close eye on the dye as it develops and rinse thoroughly.
 Preserving your color can go a long way toward preventing brassiness. Even “permanent” dyes start to fade after about 8 weeks, and frequent dyeing can severely damage you hair. Along with all of the other toning strategies, actively try to prevent your color from fading in the first place. Only wash your hair when it’s necessary – try to avoid daily washing. When you do wash it, use blue/purple toning products. Limit your sun exposure and the use of heating tools, like blow dryers and straight irons.Smoothing serums and other similar products can help you maintain color by sealing your hair cuticle when you apply them.
Always condition your hair very well. This also seals the hair cuticle and protects your color.

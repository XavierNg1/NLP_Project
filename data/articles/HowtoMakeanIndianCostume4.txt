 Cut out the neckband from the a basic white or other light colored tee shirt with sharp scissors. You should also trim the tee, so it ends at the wearer’s waist.If you want the shirt to stand out, use gem glue to add decorative craft gems to the neckline and bottom hem of the tee.
 A sari is a type of traditional, draping cloth worn by Indian women, but you can create your own with a piece of fabric. Inexpensive acetate that’s usually used for lining garments works well to make your own sari. For a child’s costume, cut the fabric so it's 30-inches wide and and 3-yards long. For adults, go with fabric that’s 45 inches wide and 6 yards long.Choose a bold color for your fabric. Jewel tones, such as emerald, ruby, or sapphire, are attractive shade options for a sari.
 To make it easier to wrap the sari, wear your cropped top with a pair of leggings or stretchy bike shorts in a neutral color. Take one end of the fabric and tuck it into the back of your leggings. Create a pleat in the fabric, and tuck the next section into the waistband, repeating the action all the way around your waist. Drape the excess fabric over your shoulder, folding from the back to the front.When you tuck the fabric into your waistband, the hem should cover your feet but rest above the floor.
Aim for approximately 7 to 10 pleats when you’re tucking in the fabric. The pleats should fall straight and point to your left.
When you drape the remaining length of fabric over you, it should be somewhere between knee-length and floor-length.
If you’re worried about your sari coming loose, secure it in place with pins.
Compliment your sari with gold or silver bangle bracelets, gold or silver hoop earrings, and flat sandals.

 This has been "deprecated", which means it works but is no longer in use or recommended. This is because HTML is not designed to style content. The <u> tag will still work, but is now supposed to represent text that is different than the other text, such as misspelled words or Chinese proper nouns.
 There is virtually no case where you should be using this method anymore. It can be good to know how it was used in case you have to update an old website.

The old underline tag in HTML <u>allowed you to underline 
things quickly</u>, but it made things a mess when other 
style elements got involved. This is why modern underlining 
is accomplished using the "text-decoration" CSS element.

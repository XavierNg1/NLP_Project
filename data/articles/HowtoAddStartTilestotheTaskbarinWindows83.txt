 The File Explorer, previously known as File Manager, allows you to browse files on your computer. Starting File Explorer gives you shortcuts to your removable media, hard drives and disk drives. There are two ways to bring up the search system.


If you are on Desktop mode, click on the Windows icon or press the ⊞ Win key on your keyboard to bring up the Modern user interface. In the top right corner of the screen, click on the magnifying glass to bring up the search function.
Move your mouse to the bottom right of the screen to bring up the Charms Bar. Click on the magnifying glass icon to bring up the search option.
 Type in “File Explorer” to bring up the File Explorer application.
 Right click on the File Explorer search result and choose “Pin to taskbar” to have it appear on the taskbar., Click and hold over a folder then drag the folder over the File Explorer icon. Right click the File Explorer icon to bring up the list of pinned folders.


This method does not allow you to pin a folder onto the taskbar separately.
You can unpin a folder shortcut by right clicking on the File Explorer icon then clicking on the pin icon that corresponds to the link you want to remove.

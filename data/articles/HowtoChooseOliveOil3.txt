 If you live near a mill that produces olive oil, see if they have a shop on sight. The fresher the oil, the better. Also, mill workers may be able to give you a better overview of the varying flavors of their oils. If you can buy directly from a mill, do so., Most people do not have the privilege of living near a mill, however. As a second resort, it's always a good idea to shop at places that allow taste testing. Gourmet food stores, farmer's markets, and stores that specialize in olive oil often allow a taste test. Tasting the oil ahead of time is a great way to ensure it has the flavor you desire., Ideally, you should be able to return olive oil if you don't like it. As olive oil is expensive, you don't want to be stuck with a bottle of oil that does not suit your needs. Make sure you're able to return olive oil you purchase and get at least some of your money back., Olive oil should be stored in dark bottles. This will increase the shelf life. A store that sells olive oil in dark bottles will likely provide higher quality, fresher oil. Avoid stores where olive oil is stored improperly.

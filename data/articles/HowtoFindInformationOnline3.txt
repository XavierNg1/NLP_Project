These terms are going to guide your search. Searching for these terms through search engines, databases, or online libraries will lead in the direction of the information you need., Whenever you find information online, read through it and figure it out whether it is a primary source, or if it is referencing something else. Most of the time, this information can be found on a web page, however, if you find information with no author data or citations at all, it may be suspect., Most strong online articles with contain citations or footnotes. These are places where you can learn more about the subject you are studying! Follow these footnotes to the primary sources your author is citing.

Next to each one, jot down anything useful you learned, and any other important notes to remember.

 To do this half-up top knot, do a horizontal part that divides the top of your hair from the bottom, starting at about ear level on one side and parting over to the other side.








Since this is a laid back look, you donâ€™t have to precisely part your hair on each side, as long as each side is roughly symmetrical.This look can work either on short or long hair.
 Take the top section of hair and gather it into a high ponytail on the top of your head. Hold it in a ponytail using one hand.
 Hold your hair in a ponytail with the fingers of one hand and use the other to wind your hair clockwise around the base of your ponytail that you are holding with your fingers.








If you have short hair, make a small loop and hold it in place with your fingers instead of wrapping your hair around.
 After you have wrapped the hair around until you reach the tips, or have made a small loop if you have short hair, use a hair tie to secure the bun. If you want a fuller looking top knot, pull the bun gently with your fingers to make it bigger.

 If you can see wrinkles, then you have your arm in the correct position. Rest the ball on the pads of your fingers with the centre of the ball on your index finger, then place your guide hand on the side of the ball and make sure that it doesn't slip underneath it. You will not be using that hand to help shoot the ball - it is there to make sure that the ball doesn't fall off your hand before you shoot it and nothing more.
 You should look like you're reaching into a cookie jar that is on a shelf above your head.

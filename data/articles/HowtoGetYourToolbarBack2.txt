 If you can't see the menu bar, press the Alt key.



If you are missing your File, Edit, View, and Tools menu options, select "Menu bar" from the list.
If you still can't see a toolbar that you installed yourself, read on.
, If your toolbar is still installed but currently disabled, it will be on this list.

 Personal protection first: Before any activity begins, the person will need to visualise themselves enveloped in a big coloured bubble of protection. The bubble can be any colour you like although white or gold are good strong protective colours.


Another form of personal protection is for the person to imagine they are stepping into a big sleeping bag, then they pull the bag up to their neck.;
, This can be done with a 'smudge' stick using sage or sweet grass etc. the person should light the smudge stick and walk around the four corners of the room waving the smudge stick in the air, thus cleansing the area.
 Black tourmaline, moonstone or other protecting stones should be used by placing them in the four corners of the space to be used for any psychic work.
 One for spirit communication and one for repelling negative energies or unwanted spirit entities.
 Finally, some effective prayers must be spoken, these can be in tune with the practitioner's personal faith, e.g. pagan, Christian etc. The prayers should contain words to the effect of protecting the psychic and the client and also should contain after reading protection upon the home vacated and the home to which the psychic will travel and any members of the psychics family in that home. After the prayers are spoken, gestures should be made by drawing either the shape of the cross or a pentacle in the air. This completes the practise.

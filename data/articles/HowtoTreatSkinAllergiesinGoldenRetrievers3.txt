 Antihistamines are commonly used to treat allergies in dogs. They work by blocking the release of histamine from mast cells (cells involved in allergic reactions). Antihistamines work best in dogs with seasonal or mild skin allergies. If this describes your Golden Retriever’s CAD, then your vet will probably prescribe an antihistamine.Antihistamines are effective in about 30% of dogs with CAD.Antihistamines are inexpensive and have very few side effects., Antihistamines work best when given consistently, not just as needed. If you give your Golden Retriever the antihistamine after an allergic reaction has started, then it’s already too late—the antihistamine needs to be in your dog’s system before the mast cells have a chance to release histamine.Your vet will probably want you to give your Golden Retriever an antihistamine two to three times daily.Antihistamines for dogs are given by mouth.
 Antihistamines do not work the same in every dog. For this reason, your vet may recommend trying up to three antihistamines before moving on to a different type of therapy. Examples of dog-safe antihistamines are Benadryl, Zyrtec, and Claritin.These are human, over-the-counter antihistamines, but their dosages can be adjusted to be effective in dogs.


Note that the active medication in Benadryl can vary depending on the country. Always check with a vet to make sure the key component of any antihistamine is safe.
Try each antihistamine for 10 – 14 days.Your Golden Retriever may need a higher dose of antihistamine than a human would need. Before using these over-the-counter antihistamines, ask your vet what dosage of antihistamine your dog will need.With each antihistamine, contact your vet to let them know if your Golden Retriever’s symptoms are getting any better.
Your Golden Retriever may still be itchy with antihistamine therapy. However, the itchiness will probably be less than what it was before.

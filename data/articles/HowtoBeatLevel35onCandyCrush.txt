 The outside edges of the game board might only have one jelly layer each, but they are tough to get to as there are fewer combinations available on the edges. Before you make any move, look to these edges and see if you can clear jelly there first.;
, These squares are located in the center of the board, in a vertical column, but each square only touch two other squares, and that too only horizontally. This means at any given time, there are only two other squares next to each of these you can use to help clear jelly. The easiest way to remove this entire column of jelly is by making a vertically striped jelly in one of these squares. When it is set off, it will clear all 4 squares of jelly.
 You will find yourself clearing the remainder of the board through chain reactions. Before you make a move, check and see if you can clear a square on the edge or in the central column first. If you canâ€™t, start making combinations at the bottom of the board to maximum chain reaction potential.

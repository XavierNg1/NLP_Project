 Local nurseries typically sell plants raised in your geographic area, which means the plants are hardy and acclimated to the regional temperatures. Online distributors and mail-order catalogs may ship dormant roots instead live plants because they survive better through the shipping process. The dormant roots will take longer to grow, but should produce healthy plants.
 Most container-bound perennials at garden centers come with tags indicating growing conditions required for healthy plants. Examine the tags to ensure the perennials you purchase will grow well in the planting bed you prepared.


Consider the height of each plant. Keep in mind that taller plants may block the view (and light) of shorter plants.






Consider the bloom color of the perennials. Bright colored plants can brighten up shady spots, while dark colored plants may add depth and texture to a full sun garden. Some gardeners select color palettes for their gardens. If you choose a color palette, ensure the bloom color of the perennial complements your palette.
 Plant Hardiness zone. The zones indicate which plants are suited for winter conditions in your geographic area. This is especially important when selecting perennials as they overwinter and come back year after year. If you select a plant not appropriate for your hardiness zone, it may die during the winter months. Plant hardiness zone maps are available online.
 Perennials will grow larger each year. When selecting perennials, take into account the size of the mature plant, which is not the same as the container-bound plant purchased at a local garden center.
 Examine each perennial before purchasing.


Choose perennials that look fresh and vigorous. Avoid leggy or floppy plants.
Inspect the plant for indication of insect damage or disease, such as broken stems, bent leaves or withered leaves. If a perennial is infested with a foliage disease, it could spread into your garden and damage other plants.

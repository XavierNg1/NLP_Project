 Stainless steel bottles come in everything from 8 oz. (0.24 l) child-sized cups to 40 oz. (1.2 l) containers. If you bike frequently or plan to use it in your car, measure your water bottle holder or car cup holder before making your final decision.;
, If you plan to hike with the water bottle and want cold water, or if you plan to use it for warm liquids, like tea or coffee, in the winter, then choose an insulated option.
 Some bottles are sold with screw caps and sport caps. If you plan to use it during exercise and regular day use, look for this combination.
 Some companies make bite valves or straws. If you plan to pour your water into a cup, this is not necessary. If you plan to drink while you are hiking or exercising, this is the best choice.
 Most steel water bottles are sold in a traditional silver color; however, Thinksport bottles come in a variety of bright colors and Camelbak bottles can be covered with a decal.

 The size of the box is up to you; it's limited only by the side ruler's length. You'll need precise measurements for the side and end pieces (length only––the depth is already determined by the ruler), and for the wooden base. The rulers will sit on the wooden base, so the base measurement needs to account for this. Finally, you may wish to make dividers inside the box; use either the ruler or the craft wood for these (ruler pieces will probably look more interesting); if so, measure these pieces too.


If you want the whole rulers to form the sides (without cutting them at all), you'll need a third ruler that is okay for sawing into shorter end pieces. Or, you can use the pine craft wood.






Larger boxes can be made using yard or meter rulers.






Tiny boxes can be made by sawing up standard size school rulers even smaller.





;
, If the craft wood is a different shade from the rulers, paint or stain it to match.


Alternatively, you can choose to stain the whole completed box, using a stain that won't cover up the ruler markings.
 Following the measurements you've determined, use a handheld saw to cut the rulers to size. If you're not cutting the length rulers, you'll still need to cut the end ruler into the right sizes.


Cut the base piece from the craft pinewood.
Cut any divider pieces too.
, Hold in place until they set––if you don't want to physically hold them, use large balls or blobs of poster tack on each side to hold in place while they dry, then remove the tack. Wipe away any excess glue.
 Again, hold in place until they set. Wipe away any excess glue.
 Wipe away any excess glue.
 This will allow it to shine and improves its overall quality. Allow to dry before using.


Before varnishing, check for any wood glue blobs. Sand these off before proceeding.
 You can now use the ruler box to keep bits and pieces. It's ideal for things like buttons, paperclips, safety pins, beads, craft items, etc. They also look neat sitting on a desk.

 A good way of cleansing your emotional state is by exerting yourself physically.You don't need to go to the gym. Simply do a quick weightless exercise:


10 reps of push-ups
30 reps of crunches
20 jumping jacks
Rest for five minutes and repeat

, One of the most therapeutic activities you can do to yourself is to go out on a run. Getting your cardiovascular system going will help clear some of your scary thoughts., This activity should help you twice as much. You are surrounding yourself with people and exerting yourself physically. Try whatever sport you like to play with your friends, whether it's football, soccer, basketball, or whatever.
 Yoga requires you to control your breathing and send it to different parts of the body. Doing this as a way of coping with scary things, can be very therapeutic. Going to a yoga class will improve your technique and help center yourself into a peaceful environment.


If you're unable to go to a yoga class, try doing some simple yoga moves at home.

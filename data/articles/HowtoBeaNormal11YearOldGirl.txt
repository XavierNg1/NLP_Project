 Start washing your face twice daily, and if necessary use an acne-fighting but gentle face wash. Make sure you wear an oil-free sunscreen when you're out in the sun, and try on-the-spot acne treatment if you break out. But don't get caught up worrying about a few blemishes; it's all part of becoming a teen.;
, Shower or bathe every other day, and use a sweet-smelling shampoo/body wash. If desired, talk to you parents about shaving your legs.
 Just make sure you brush your teeth two times a day. Use mouthwash if you want to. Floss.
 It looks unnatural on girls of your age. If you want to wear just a little bit, stick to a lip gloss and possibly mascara. Keep it simple.
 Do not wear low cut shirts, or those tiny tiny short shorts! Keep it casual. Jeans, Bermuda shorts, graphic t-shirts, regular plain shirts, sweaters, jackets. Just normal stuff! Get some cool and casual shoes too, like sneakers, tennis shoes, or high tops.
 If you want to be a normal 11 year old girl you have to have friends! Just be yourself and be fun, and someone will come along and you will be friends with them! Joining in clubs or after school activities will boost your chances of finding more friends!

, No one likes a mean person who frowns all the time! Smile, and walk with confidence. Keep your head high and your back straight!

 In order to find the total amount you will pay over the course of the time you pay back a loan, you will have to work through the article in stages. Let’s look at an example article:


”You borrow 5,000 from a bank and plan to repay the loan principal, plus and accumulated interest in five years. The rate of the interest is 10%. How much will you pay, in total, at the end of the five years?

, Once you have read through the article, create an equation based on the standard equation F = P(1 + i)^N. For our question, our equation would be:


F = 5000(1 + 0.1)^5.
 When you have written out your equation, start to solve your problem. The first step towards doing this is to solve the equation within the parentheses first. For our equation:


Solve (1 + 0.1) = 1.1. So now our equation looks like this: F = 5000(1.1)^5.
 Once you have simplified the information in the parentheses, you should move onto applying the years (N) of the equation. This means raising the number inside the parentheses to the Nth degree. For our equation:


(1.1)^5 means multiplying 1.1 to itself five times. In this case, (1.1)^5 = 1.61051.
 You should now only have one step left in the process of solving your equation. To finish the equation and find F, or the total amount paid, you will have to multiply P with the number in the parentheses. For our equation:


F = 5000(1.61051) therefore, F = $8,052.55. That means that you would have paid $8,052.55 over the course of the five years.

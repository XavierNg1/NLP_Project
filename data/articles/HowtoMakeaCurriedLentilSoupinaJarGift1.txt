 You want a clear jar that is large enough to hold approximately 3 to 4 cups of ingredients and has a re-sealable lid.


Consider jars that have interest or are of a unique shape.
Avoid jars with labels (or make sure you can easily remove the label).;
, Consider the recipient to determine he or she likes or can eat everything in the recipe. If the recipient has an allergy or aversion to a certain ingredient, determine if you can omit or substitute that particular ingredient. If you find that more than two ingredients need to be omitted or substituted, consider going with a different recipe.


Purchase dried bay leaves, turmeric, curry powder, dried chili pepper, sun-dried tomatoes (not packed in oil), package of red lentils and yellow lentils.
Consider going for organic ingredients for an extra-special recipe.
 You want spices to be separate inside your jarred gift so either go with a cheesecloth sachet if you can find one, or you can use a small plastic bag. Make sure the sachet or bag can be sealed or tied.
 This includes ribbon or wrapping to encase the gift, a hole punch, sturdy cardstock and an artist pen. If you prefer to laser print your recipe card, make sure your paper can be fed through your printer.


Look at decorative additions you can make to your recipe card such as glitter or small stickers.

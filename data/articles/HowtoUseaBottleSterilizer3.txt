 Most cold water sterilizers double as microwave sterilizers. For cold water sterilization, the bottles will not actually sit on the tray used during the microwaving process.
 You will need to fill the basin with very cold water. Each unit will need to be filled above the microwave fill line since you are using the water itself to sterilize the bottles, not the steam.
 Use one manufactured specifically for use with your sterilizer or a product that is labeled for use with bottle sterilizers. Sterilizing solutions not marketed for use with bottle sterilizers may not be safe to use on your baby's bottles.
 Allow the bottles to completely fill with water.
 The weight of the tray can help keep the bottles and accessories beneath the water's surface, ensuring that they are completely sterilized.
 In many cases, the bottles should only stay submerged for as long as the water stays cold. You will likely need to remove the bottles after 10 to 15 minutes, but exact times will vary.

 Some of the satellite providers are flexible with respect to extending payment terms. Both Dish Network and DIRECTV have options for people who are behind on their bills DIRECTV is surprisingly flexible. Even if you’re scheduled to be disconnected, they will work with you. While you can only stop them from disconnecting it by putting in a request to stop the service call once. However, if you get to them before things are scheduled for disconnection and “Make a Promise to Pay” and tell them when, they’re fine.
Dish Network is not quite as flexible as DIRECTV, but they still offer a standard option to avoid disconnection. As long as the past due amount is below $200, you can extend the payment term another month for $9.00.
 If you fall behind on your phone bill , reaching out to the phone company is the best course of action. All of the big three phone providers (Verizon, Sprint, and T-mobile) have options to stretch out a past due bill across several pay periods., Unfortunately, there is no way to generalize with utilities and say for certain that one will grant you an extension. Some will, many won't. Just call them up and ask.


In some states, it is illegal to cut utilities off without first giving a certain period of notice. In many others, it is legal. In the absence of one national policy, its probably best to contact legal aid in your area. You can contact them at http://www.lsc.gov/what-legal-aid/find-legal-aid. They might be able to put you in touch with a social service agency in your community that could assist you.

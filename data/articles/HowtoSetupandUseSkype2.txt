 You will be asked to sign in with your Skype username, your Microsoft account, or your Facebook account, depending on the option you chose during your account creation. Enter the necessary information and sign in.
 Upon starting Skype for the first time, you will be asked to choose a profile picture. This is an optional step but makes it easier for your contacts to recognize you.
 During the first time startup, Skype will attempt to test your webcam and microphone. If they are properly connected to your computer, you should see an image from your webcam appear in a box. Speak a few words into the microphone to make sure that it is working properly.
 Once Skype is up and running, you will be presented with your profile. Your list of contacts appears on the left side of the application and is most likely currently empty. To add contacts, click the “+” button next to the person icon above the contacts list.


Search by name, email address, or Skype username.
Select the person that you want to add from the results list. This will open their profile in the right frame of the app. You can send them a text message, call them, or add them to your contacts. Click the blue link in the text area to add them to your contact list.

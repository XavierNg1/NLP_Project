 Even the most basic support groups require some money to run. Meet with your committee to consider fundraisers, grants, sponsors, donations and costs associated with running your group.
 Ask for resources and donations. They may also be able to be involved as guest speakers in the future.
 Consistency is extremely important for disabled people who are looking for support. Decide whether it will be a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly group.
 Hospitals, clinics or support group members may be able offer space to conduct the support groups. Keep in mind that the place should have ramps, close parking, seating and be fairly central.


Certain meeting places, such as homes, may not be able to host a support group for liability reasons. You may want to contact your home insurance carrier to see if extra insurance is necessary.

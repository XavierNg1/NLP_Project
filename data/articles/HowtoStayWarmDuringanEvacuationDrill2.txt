 Crouch down on the ground, then pull the bottom of your sweatshirt over legs. Additionally, tuck your head between your legs. Realize that this may stretch your sweatshirt, and possibly ruin it.
 Your armpits are the warmest part of your body. Cross your arms and place them between your legs and your chest.
 This helps keep your face warm, as well as warming up the air you breathe.Â It also limits the amount of warm air that leaves and cold air that enters.
 This will keep you even warmer. However, unless your sweatshirt is large, you may not be able to fit.

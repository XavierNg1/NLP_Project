 Chop roughly.
Peel the onions, chop roughly.
Remove the stem and seeds from the bell peppers. Chop roughly.
Core the apples. Chop roughly. Leave the peel intact.
Mince the garlic cloves.
 Tip in the apple cider vinegar and the salt. Stir together.
 Bring to the boil, then turn down to a simmer. Let simmer for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Stir now and then, checking that the mixture isn't burning on the base.
 Remove the seeds from half of the peppers.


Wear gloves to stop your hands from stinging.
 All items used for canning must be sterilized too (lids, seals, tongs, spoons).
 Mix through, then cook on a simmer for another 5 minutes.
 Mash the relish with a potato masher. Boil again.
 Seal and label. The seals must pop down; if not, that jar hasn't worked––transfer the ingredients back for more boiling or freeze the ingredients instead. (If still waiting for the lids to go down after the relish completely cools down, keep the relish in the refrigerator. After 12 hours, decide not to preserve the relish but instead consume it from the fridge within the next 2 weeks.)


To freeze, place inside sterilized glass jars but allow room for expansion during freezing.

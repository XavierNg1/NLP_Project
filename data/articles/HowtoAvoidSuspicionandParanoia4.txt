 You absolutely have a right to be angry with people who hurt you when you were in a vulnerable position or that took advantage of you. But this anger cannot be transferred to every person you meet. Carrying around anger and distrust toward people hurts you most. Anger management techniques can help you reduce stress levels and improve your relationships.You can learn to become a better communicator, solve problems, and think differently.
 If you have problems trusting others (especially friends, family, or a significant other), turn the tables on yourself. Think about how you would feel if someone you cared about or spent a lot of time with didn't trust anything that you did or said. Think about how it would feel if someone kept badgering you about your whereabouts and thoughts. How does that make you feel? Suspicious probing is unpleasant at best, and downright invasive and unsettling at its worst.


If you feel prejudiced, find commonalities that you may have with the person you distrust. Build a relationship with them, be curious about their life, and remind yourself that they’re human just like you., While you’re learning to trust others, choose to trust yourself as well. By seeing the world suspiciously, you can project your own unresolved fears onto others. There are many genuine and true people out there. Put the focus on yourself and learn to trust yourself first. Remove people from your life that doubt your abilities or say you can’t succeed. Keep your commitments to yourself by following through on things you want or need to do.When you say you’re going to do something, know that you will do it. For example, if you say that you’re going to go exercise today, know that you can and will follow through on that commitment.

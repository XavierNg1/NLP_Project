 The desire to feel heard and appreciated exists in all age groups. Team building exercises for adults typically focus on improved collaboration, decision making and communication.
 For example, a project team might have a hard time working together, with each person focused only on his/her own tasks. In this case, the exercise could focus on an activity that involves relying on one another.
 For example, if working with a 20-member team, break them into 4 groups of 5 people each.
 One example is to work together in a small group to build an object. Provide wood, a small saw, glue, a hammer and nails and ask the groups to construct a bridge.


Reconvene as a large group to discuss the experience. Each group can present its bridge and explain the process of creating it. Some people may have stood aside; others may have taken charge.
Ask team members to write down their reactions to the team building exercise. A common reaction in such exercises is for individual members to downplay the amount of conflict that occurred to minimize group embarrassment. Writing out the feelings and thoughts that accompanied the activity generally helps people to identify their personal challenges in a group setting.
 To encourage leadership skills throughout the team, assign the participants who ordinarily sit back to serve as leaders.

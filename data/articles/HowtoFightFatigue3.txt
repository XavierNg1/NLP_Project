 Eating a balanced, healthy diet will provide you with more energy and prevent you from feeling sluggish and fatigued.


Therefore, you should increase the amount of healthy foods like fruit, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products and lean meats in your diet.
On the other hand, you should reduce your intake of not-so-healthy foods such as those with a high salt, high sugar or high fat content., Fatigue is sometimes caused by anemia, which is a red blood cell deficiency often caused by a lack of iron in the diet.


Eating more iron-rich foods can help to restore the levels of red blood cells in your system, so try to eat more lean meat, tofu, shellfish, beans and seeds.
Alternatively, you could take an iron supplement, but speak to your doctor about this first.
 Eating omega-3 fatty acids has been shown to boost alertness and increase energy levels, in addition to numerous other healthful benefits.


Human bodies do not produce omega-3 naturally, so it's important to include omega-3 food in your diet. You can do this by eating fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel and tuna.
If you're not a fish fan, you can also find omega-3s in walnuts and flaxseeds, or you could take a fish oil supplement., Your energy levels are closely linked to your blood sugar levels, which may spike or fall as a result of overeating or under eating.


Overeating will cause your blood sugar levels to spike, which may drain your energy and leave you feeling sleepy. Instead of eating three large meals a day, try eating six mini meals in order to spread your energy intake evenly over the day.
Under eating or skipping meals over the course of the day will cause your blood sugar levels to dip, leaving you feeling weak and out of energy. Always eat breakfast (even a cereal bar is better than nothing) and snack on a piece of fruit or low-fat yogurt when you feel peckish.

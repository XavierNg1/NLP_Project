 Simply being aware of your breath can help you calm down. After reading a Creepypasta, do some basic breathing exercises to ease your anxiety.Breathe in through your nose. Make sure to channel your breath so your stomach rises.
Then, exhale slowly through your mouth.
Repeat this 10 times. You should notice yourself becoming increasingly calm.
 Muscle relaxation is another simple way to ease tension. If you're having trouble unwinding, try tensing and releasing your muscles to ease anxiety.Move from your head to your toes. Tense muscles, like your shoulders, for a few seconds and then release them. Move downward, until you've reached your toes.
If you're stressed, your muscles naturally tense up. By consciously tensing them and releasing them, you're relieving yourself of some of the physical feelings of stress.
 If you can't get a Creepypasta out of your head, journal about your feelings. Pull out a notebook and pen and pencil and write. Purge your feelings about how and why the story scared you. Do a free write until you can't think of anything else to say. Jotting down your thoughts can help you get them out of your system.For example, you can start with something like, "I'm so scared of the story I just read. It was about a woman who can talk to spirits, and it was just so disturbing."
Continue venting your thoughts. For example, "I don't really think spirits are real, and if they are they probably won't hurt me. But I'm still nervous, which is frustrating."

, Exercise can reduce anxiety. If you're unable to relax after reading Creepypasta, do something physical. This can help ease your fears.Go for a walk or run.
Go for a bike ride.
Do some jumping jacks or light cardio in your living room.

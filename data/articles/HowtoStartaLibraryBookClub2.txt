 You need a minimum of three or five members to have an active conversation at each meeting, but you should not exceed a group of 12 or 15. If you have more members than that, the odds of hearing from everyone who wants to speak are greatly reduced.
 Include the basic information, such as the date and time you plan on meeting as well as the types of books you plan on covering. Also include an e-mail address or phone number that interested parties can use to contact you for further information or to RSVP to the first meeting.
 Ask if you can place flyers at the check-out counter or near the computers. If not, find out if there is a bulletin board or anywhere else inside the library where you could hang a flyer.


If your library is part of a large enough branch, it may have a website that lists the various events going on at the library. If so, request that your library adds your book club to the calendar.
 Relatives, friends, and acquaintances are all good people to consider, especially if you know someone who loves reading. You can also ask people you know to spread the word to others.
 Even if you do not know them personally, you can bring up your book club to workers or customers at the bookstore, members of your church, parents whose children go to school with your son or daughter, or patrons sipping coffee and reading a book in the local cafe. You can even invite the librarian to stop by your group.
 If your library hosts other clubs or one-day events, attend a few of these and find out if any of the members would be interested in joining a book club. Since the people there are already familiar with events held at the library, they may feel more comfortable or willing to attend a library book club.
 If you cannot garner enough interest using more focused means, you can advertise your library book club in the local paper several weeks before the first scheduled meeting. You can also place a similar advertisement on a free online classifieds website.

 Find the Uber app on your phone by looking for its icon in your apps or by searching for it. Then, tap on the icon.;
, When you are ready to order your Uber, tap the "Set Pickup Location" button in the middle of your map.


If your pickup location is somewhere other than where the map defaults to, type the location into the box at the top of your screen labelled by a green dot.
You can also change your pickup location by tapping and dragging the screen towards your preferred location. The "Pickup Location" pin will stay in the center of your screen.
 Tap the "Enter Destination" box (labelled by a red dot) and type your destination into the box.
 Tap the black button at the bottom of your screen labelled "Request Uber" and wait for the request to go through.
 When the request is accepted, you will see a circle just below the map on your screen cycling between the image of your driver's face and their car. Tap on this circle to see more information about the driver.
 On the left half of your screen, you will see an image of your driver's face with their star rating directly beneath it. This is your driver's average rating.


Most drivers you will see in the app will have very high star ratings. When a driver reaches an average rating of less than 4.6 stars, they may be suspended until they complete a re-training program.This is not necessarily due to their poor quality as drivers, but because Uber has very high standards for the service provided by drivers. Use your driver's star ratings as confirmation that you can feel comfortable accepting a ride from your driver.

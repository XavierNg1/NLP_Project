 Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't. It depends on what He wants you to do.;
, Sometimes they can inspire you. They may also give you a few ideas. But don't copy a line from a song, that's not truthful.
 Do whatever you can to get your mind focused on your song.
 Right-brained people may find it easier, butt if you're a left-brained person, you might want to start from the beginning.
 It sounds better if you have a different note for each syllable. Say you have the phrase, "And now I know Jesus loves me!" Every word should have it's own notes. But, "And" could have a C, "now" could have an E, and "I" could have a C. In my opinion, it sounds better if each syllable has a different note. Try what works for you.
 If you want orchestration, do it now. Sometimes it's easier to find someone who has more experience in this area.
 After that's done, sing the words along with it, and find several other people to sing it, or listen to it. Get their opinion.

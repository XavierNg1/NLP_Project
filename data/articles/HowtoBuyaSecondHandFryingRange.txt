 Around 25 years ago range manufacturers stopped building frying ranges with gas taps fitted. In the present day these gas taps no longer conform to current standards and gas regulations meaning that the equipment is listed “AT RISK” and a Gas Safe registered engineer is not allowed to re-fit the range into another premises.;
, Flame failure devices will stop the gas to the burners if the pilot flame fails. Older ranges may not have these fitted which means the frying range does not comply to the directive and cannot be legally installed into new premises.
 Gas frying ranges require a fan powered extraction system to remove the products of cooking and the products of combustion from the shop. The gas supply is interlocked with the fan system this means that if the fan should fail the gas supply is shut down.
 For a range to be legal moved and fit into new premises the manual must be provided for the Gas Safe engineer to install the range. The range should have a serial number on it and the manufacturer who made the range. Contact the manufacturer with the serial number and they should provide you with the documents.
 Any reputable frying range firm will be able to help you with the points above if you are new to the business.

 Pinch off the side-muscles, if necessary. They will feel like a tough spot on the side of the scallop. Once you have done this, rinse the scallops with cool water and pat them dry with a paper towel.
 Stir everything together with a fork until evenly combined. You will be tossing the scallops in this first.
 Keep mixing until the yolk breaks and you get an even color. This act as a sort of glue, and help the breadcrumbs stick to the scallops later on.
 You will be dipping the scallops in this last. It will give them a crunchy texture when you fry them. You can use plain breadcrumbs, or "flavored" ones (such as garlic) for something fancier.
 You want them to be lightly coated with the flour mixture. Because of how many scallops you have, consider working with only a few at a time.
 The easiest way to do this would be to use a slotted spoon. This way, you won't have to worry about wasting any of the egg mixture up while dipping the scallops.
 Roll them around with a spoon, then transfer them to a large baking sheet. Make sure that they are evenly coated with the breadcrumbs.
 If you don't have a deep fryer, you can also use a 2-quart (1.9 liters) saucepan or another deep pan.Whatever you choose to use, it must be able to safely hold 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) of oil..


Test the oil to ensure it is hot enough. Place a small cube of bread into the oil. If it starts to turn brown within 1 to 2 minutes, it is hot enough to cook scallops.
, Once the scallops finish draining, you can either serve them, or put them into a warm oven heated to 300°F (148.9°C).This will keep the scallops warm while you fry the rest.


Drain the scallops by placing them on a few sheets of paper towels. This will help soak up the excess grease and keep them from becoming soggy.
 Sprinkle with lemon juice if desired.

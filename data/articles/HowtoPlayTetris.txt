 Tetris is available on almost all electronic mediums, you can try it on your computer; a GBA or Nintendo DS work too.;
, As you play the game levels will go up, but you need to start at a low level to help you practice.
 Try to move the tetrominoes to get them to move together.
 In traditional Tetris games there are seven different types of tetrominoes:



I-blocks are useful for getting 'Tetris', that is competing four lines at once.

O-blocks for filling large gaps.

L-blocks for filling medium-sized holes.

J-blocks face the opposite direction as L-blocks.

S-blocks for filling small holes.
Z-blocks face the opposite direction as S-blocks.







T-blocks are also for filling small holes.
 These can range from the A button, X button, space bar, enter key or even something else, depending on your particular Tetris game.
 The more lines completed at once, the more points gained. Completing the maximum number of lines at once, four, is known as a 'Tetris' and can only be pulled off with straight, long rectangle tetrominoes.
 This will become easier the more you play, don't rush yourself.

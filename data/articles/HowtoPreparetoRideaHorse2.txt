 An easy way to check if they are cooled of is to place your hand on their chest. If it is hot, keep walking your horse. If you don't your horse could get sick.
 Undo the nose band and throat latch buckles,lift the top of the bridle up and hold it there for a while until you can lower it without banging the horse teeth. If the horse doesn't release the bit, stick your thumb in the corner of it's mouth. Then, put the halter on, take the reins over it's head,and tie it back up. Now, you take it's saddle off. First take off the girth and drape it over the back of the saddle. Then undo the keepers from the straps and lift the saddle off the horse's back. If you are riding English, run up your stirrups first.
, Walk your horse around until it dries. Only rinse your horse if it is warm outside. If it is cold, don't exercise your horse so much it sweats hard. When you are done riding it,don't walk it as long and put it in it's stall with a cooler on it for an hour or two instead.
 Offer it a sip of water after you are done walking it, and a sip of water after you untack it. Then with hold water for 15-20 min. depending on how hard it was worked.

 Examples would be Eevee to Leafeon or Glaceon, Magneton to Magnezone, Nosepass to Probopass. Eevee only evolves to Leafeon or Glaceon at Moss Rock (which is in Eterna Forest) and Ice Rock (which is just beyond Snowpoint) for each Pokemon, respectively. To evolve Magneton or Nosepass, level it up anywhere inside Mt. Coronet.

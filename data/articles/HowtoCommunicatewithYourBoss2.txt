 Be proactive and don’t wait until there’s a problem to talk to your boss, as this could negatively tinge your interactions. Instead, give your boss selective updates about your progress.
 Keep your conversations with your boss positive by talking about results. If you were able to meet your quarterly goal, bring this to the attention of your boss. Talk to them about how you achieved these results. For example, this may have been a mixture of effective teamwork, leadership, and strategic risk-taking. This will show your boss that you are driven and can complete your tasks.
 Determine just what exactly you want to get out of talking with your boss. Be it in person, via email, or by phone, your communication should have a specified purpose. Since your boss likely has a lot on their plate, they will appreciate an employee who knows what they want and how to ask for it.If you have a problem you’re not sure how to solve, outline what parts of the problem you are unsure about and bring these points up to your boss in order.If you want to ask for a raise, prepare what you’re going to say ahead of time. Type out an outline of your value points and rehearse how you’ll talk about the topic at least a few days in advance.

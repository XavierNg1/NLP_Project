 The secret to a close shave and shiny, glowing legs is exfoliating before you shave. Exfoliation will remove dead skin cells that could otherwise clog up your razor. A razor clogged with dead skin cells will prevent you from getting a close shave., Use a firm, natural-bristle brush. Begin by brushing the outside of your knee. Brush upwards, applying enough pressure to stimulate circulation. Continue by brushing the inside of the thigh. Then brush the calf, beginning at the foot and brushing toward the groin. Finish by brushing your buttocks from the middle out toward your hip.While you want to apply pressure, you should not press so hard that it hurts.
 Exfoliating gloves are a great, chemical-free way to exfoliate your legs. You can use them while you are in the shower, and donâ€™t need any special products. Simply get into a warm shower, allow your skin to hydrate in the steam and water for at least two minutes, and rub your legs with the gloves., Physical exfoliants that use salt, coffee grinds, sand, or other harsh ingredients leave tiny cuts on your skin. This is undesirable before a shave, as shaving already puts your delicate skin at risk for nicks and cuts.

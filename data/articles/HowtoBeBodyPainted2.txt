 If you are getting a body painting at a fair or carnival, decide on a design. Many face and body painting booths have pictures of designs hanging up that you can choose from. See if you like any of these designs, or ask if they can do other designs.


When it’s your turn to get painted, tell the body painter about what design you want. If the design is not one of the ones displayed, describe what you want.
You can say something like, “I want a blue octopus,” or “I want a tree with an orange sun behind it.”
Make sure to specify what colors you want for your design. Consider drawing it if the artist seems unsure of what you want.
 Choose a good place for your body painting. Pick a spot that is large enough to fit your design and that is exposed rather than under clothing. Also try to pick a spot that is relatively hairless, as it’s harder to paint intricate details over hair.


Good spots for small body paintings include your upper arms, calves, or the top of your chest if you are wearing a tank top.
Once you pick the spot, the painter will likely wash the area with water and mild soap to clean the skin.
If the spot you pick is on your face, neck or shoulders and you have long hair, tie it back to make sure it doesn't get in the way!

, Even body or face paint used at fairs can cause allergic reactions in some. If you have allergies or sensitive skin, do a spot test on your arm and wait fifteen minutes. If your skin becomes inflamed, do not proceed getting painted and ask if they have any other kinds of paint., Small body paintings can be very detailed, so it’s important to sit still as the artist works. If you fidget, their brush could slip, which could mess up your design., After the artist is finished, look at your design in a mirror. If you want them to add anything or change a section of the design, ask if that is possible. Otherwise, enjoy your new body art!

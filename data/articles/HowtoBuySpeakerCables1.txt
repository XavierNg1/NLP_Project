If you have a basic home theater system and your speakers are fairly close to your receiver, you will be fine with standard speaker cables. However, better wiring has higher quality metals that actually increase conductivity, which can lead to a higher quality of sound.;

If you have high quality speakers, you’ll likely hear a noticeable difference between high end and low-end speaker cables. However, if you don’t hear enough of a difference to warrant the price difference, simply return the higher priced cables.
Make sure the store where you purchase your speaker cables has a good return policy if you plan to run a test at home.

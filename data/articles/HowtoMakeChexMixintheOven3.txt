 Set your oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius). While that heats up, break any large pretzels or bagel chips into bite-size pieces. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper and spread your pretzels, chips, nuts, and Chex across those. When the oven’s ready, place the cookie sheets inside and bake for 15 minutes., Place your butter in a large, ungreased roasting pan and stick that into the oven with the dry ingredients. Watch over it and remove once the butter melts. Then add your Worcestershire sauce, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder, plus any other seasonings that you care to use. Stir to combine., Once the dry ingredients have baked for 15 minutes, lower the oven to 250 degrees F (121 Celsius). Transfer the dry goods from the cookie sheets to the roasting pan. Stir them into the wet mixture until they’re evenly coated. Then, when the oven has reached its new temperature, put the roasting pan in. Check and stir every 15 minutes until they’re done.Since you already baked the dry goods once, the second bake may take less time than the full hour that’s usually needed for a one-time bake. The mix should brown like toast when it's ready.

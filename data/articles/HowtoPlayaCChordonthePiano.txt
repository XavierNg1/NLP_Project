 Put your thumb over the C note (the white key before the two blacks) and then play each white key with your thumb to your middle finger. Then cross your thumb underneath your middle finger to the next white key, and after that use the rest of your fingers to play the rest of the white keys. Then from your pinky to your thumb, go back down the piano. When you reach your thumb, cross your middle finger over to the next key and then play back down from there to your thumb. Try this a couple of times until you get it right.;
, Put your thumb on C, your middle finger on E and your pinky on G. Press down all of them together. What you got? A C Chord!

, Not much different then a major C, but your middle finger is on E flat. So try that!

, All you do is put your thumb on C, your forefinger on E, your middle finger on G and your third finger on B flat. C dominant!

, Mess around with the chords and use your other hand to do little solos or bass notes!

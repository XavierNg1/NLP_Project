 Set it up like a standard business letter. Open a blank word processing document and set the font to something legible, such as Times New Roman 12 point.


Use letterhead if you have it, and leave enough space at the top.
 If you don’t know who you are sending the letter to, then use “To Whom It May Concern.”However, you should use the person’s name if you know it.
 In the first paragraph, explain that you are writing to verify that the tenants live on your property. Also include the address where they live.For example, you can write, “I am writing to confirm that Mr. Richard Alley currently lives as a tenant on my property located at 1234 End of the Road, Jonesport, Maine 04649.”

, You may also need to state how long someone has rented from you. You should include the dates and when the current lease expires.


For example, you can write, “Mr. Alley began renting form me on January 1, 2011. His current lease is set to expire on December 31, 2017.”

, Your tenants might want you to provide other information, depending on the circumstances. Include that information here, in its own paragraph.


For example, you might need to include information on the rent. You can write, “Mr. Alley’s current rent is $700 a month.”

, State that you can be reached by telephone to answer questions and include your phone number. Type “Yours Sincerely” and then include your name and signature.If you want, you can include your phone number and/or email address underneath your signature.

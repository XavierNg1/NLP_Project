 To avoid potential kickback, you want to make sure that the blades of the saw are as high as the thickness of the piece of wood you are cutting. Use the blade adjusting handle on the bottom of your table saw to either raise or lower the blade. The blade should be about a .25 inches (0.635 cm) higher than the thickness of the wood you intend to cut., Use a tape measure to measure the distance from the saw blade to the fence. There will be a handle that will tighten and loosen the side rail, so that you can move it left to right. Move the side fence to the distance that you want to cut your board.


For instance, if you need to cut a 2-foot (61 cm) wide board, you'd measure 2 feet (61 cm) between the side fence and the saw blade., Place your thumb and hand carefully behind the piece of wood between the fence and saw blade. Set the wood firmly against the table saw and the side fence to prevent kickback.
 Lower the plastic guard blade over the blade to protect you from debris. Turn on the blade and get ready to cut.
 At a slow and steady rate, push your board through the blade. Concentrate on keeping the board flush with your fence as you push it through. Never put your hand close to the blade, and always use a push device or insert if there is not at least 6 inches (15.24 cm) between your hand and your blade.A sharp blade and a flat board will prevent your wood from splintering or chipping.
 Flip the switch on your table saw to turn it off. Your board should now be properly cut to your intended dimensions.

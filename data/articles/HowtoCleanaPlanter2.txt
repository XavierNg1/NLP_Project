 If you are making your own compost, it’s very easy to spread disease around the garden. Diseases may spread if you take pruned plant matter from one part of the garden and place it in your compost pile to be used in a separate part of your garden. Avoid composting any material that shows signs of disease.


If in doubt, don’t add it to the compost pile. The heat from a well-constructed compost pile usually kills off disease but this process can’t always be relied on.
 While insects can be beneficial to your garden, some insects may carry diseases that could harm your plants. Activities such as sweeping up leaf litter will remove habitats for small mammals and insects. You’ll need to find your own balance between being a wildlife-tolerant gardener and trying to stop insects from spreading disease.


You might compromise by having an insect-friendly part of your garden that is separated from the rest of your garden.
Don’t blindly spray any insect that comes into your garden and be prepared to lose a few leaves to caterpillars—they turn into butterflies that help your plants after all.
 This article has talked about plant diseases but it’s also important to protect yourself. Plants don’t tend to share diseases with humans but there have been some instances of compost transmitting diseases to gardeners. Rest assured this is very rare. However, it is still good practice to wear gardening gloves whenever you handle compost or manure.Wash your hands after handling compost and avoid situations where you are breathing in compost dust.

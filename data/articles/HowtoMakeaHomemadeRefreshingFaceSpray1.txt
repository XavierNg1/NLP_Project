 Peel and dice one small cucumber and add it to 1 teaspoon of aloe vera and enough water to fill your spray bottle. This combination acts as a cooling and soothing mixture for the face.To properly prepare the cucumber, you can either put the diced cucumber in boiled water and leave it to soak overnight before straining, or you can put it in a blender and then strain it through a cheesecloth to get all the liquid out.Cucumber may have a cooling or soothing effect when applied to the skin. Aloe vera has been shown to improve acne and mild burns like sunburn.You may also add ½ teaspoon of lemon juice to the mixture for an extra refreshing twist.;
, Combine equal parts coconut water and aloe vera for the base of this spray. Then add sweet almond and macadamia essential oils for hydration and a sweet, tropical scent.Coconut water may go bad quickly, so it’s best to make this spray in small batches, make sure to store it in the fridge, and use it up in about a week.
Add the essential oils in whatever quantity you like to achieve a nice scent and consistency.
 Peel one or two oranges and one or two lemons and allow the peels to sit in boiled water overnight. Add Vitamin E oil from two capsules to the mixture and shake to combine.Be sure to strain the water with the citrus peels after leaving to soak overnight. You will use only the resulting water and not the peels themselves in the spray.
The Vitamin E oil is used as a natural preservative, which you can add to any face spray via capsules or by purchasing a bottle of the oil. Combined with the Vitamin C in citrus used here, Vitamin E may also help to protect against skin inflammation related to sun exposure.

 Your dog probably thinks it’s the pack leader if it excitedly barks and jumps on you and guests when they walk into your home. By taking steps to become a calm and assertive pack leader, you can train your Jack Russell to not exert its energy in destructive ways. Some ways you can do this are:


Don’t give your dog affection right when you walk in the door.
Correct the behavior by firmly and clearly moving the dog to the side.
When guests arrive, get into the habit of commanding your dog to sit patiently as they enter., Buy a clicker at a pet store for as little as $5 and use it to train your dog through positive reinforcement and association. If you make eye contact, click the clicker only when you want your Jack Russell to act calmly, and then reward this behavioral correction, your dog will quickly learn that calmness is rewarded., Ignoring your Jack Russell when it’s jumping and barking excessively will communicate that misbehavior won’t get it anywhere. Your dog just wants attention, whether positive or negative. Ignoring your dog keeps it from seeking attention in this negative, hyperactive way.

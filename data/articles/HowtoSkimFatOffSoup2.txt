 Remove the soup from the heat source and place a lid on the stockpot. Allow it to sit for 10 to 20 minutes at room temperature.


Make sure that none of the ingredients in the soup will spoil if left out at room temperature for a prolonged period of time. Soups that contain dairy and meat, for instance, may not be able to remain out as long as those that only contain broth or a few vegetables.
Note that this method does require a lot of time, so it won't be suitable if you need soup on the table within the hour. It can be a great method to use if you are preparing soup a day or more in advance, though.



Once the soup chills completely, the fat at the surface will solidify into larger, firmer chunks.
 Glide a large metal spoon underneath the solid pieces of fat and carefully lift them out. Discard the fat and reserve the lean soup.


After removing the fat, you can reheat the soup on the stove or in a microwave before serving it.

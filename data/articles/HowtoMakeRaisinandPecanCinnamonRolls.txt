 Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a small pan. Take the pan off the heat. Then use a fork to beat in the ½ cup milk, and then the eggs.
 Cover with plastic wrap and set it aside for 10 minutes so the dough can expand and the plastic wrap prevents the dough from drying out., Then scrape the dough out of the bowl onto it. This prevents the dough from sticking to your work surface., With dry, floured hands, knead the dough into a smooth, springy ball. This should only take 30 seconds or so., Then put the dough into it. Lightly oil a sheet of plastic wrap and cover the bowl. Put the bowl in a warm (not hot) place. After 1 hour, the dough will have doubled in size., Turn the dough out onto it. Press the dough out to a rectangle, about 16 x 12 inches using your knuckles and palms., Chop the pecans, and scatter over

, Roll the dough around the filling, as though you’re rolling up a carpet.
 Cut the rest of the roll into 12 equal slices.
 Put the rolls in the pan, cut-sides up, spaced apart.
 Then loosely drape it over the rolls. Leave in a warm place for 30 minutes, or until the dough looks puffy and they have grown together. Preheat the oven to 350˚F.
 Cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Turn out of the pan and put them onto a cooling rack., Then mix with 2 tablespoons milk to make a smooth, runny icing. Spoon it over the rolls while they’re still warm.

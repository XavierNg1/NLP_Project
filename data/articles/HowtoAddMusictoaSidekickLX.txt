 Plug in the USB cable from your phone to your computer.;
, Wait for Autoplay to open which says 'Memory Card' then click 'View Files'.
 On the View Files window you should see a folder called Music, drag and drop all the music you want into this folder.
 If you would like to transfer your music to your phone memory instead of a memory card, do the same, the Autoplay window will just be called 'Phone Memory' instead.
 Look inside the folder to see if all the music you want is copied to the Sidekick LX.
 Go to Library, then go to Music, and all your music should be on your Sidekick LX!

 If the live bait needs to remain alive and natural looking for as long as possible, you can attach it with a secure bridle rather than a damaging hook.


Have a more experienced fisher make a bridle for you, or follow the instructions for Making a Bridle to create your own.
 You can do this through the eye sockets above or in front of the eyes (not through them), or through a hole in its back near the head.You can use an open eye live bait needle instead of a crochet needle.
 Use the end of the needle to catch the loop end of the bridle and draw it through the fish.


Keep hold of the loop so the fish's wriggling doesn't pull it back out again.
 You should now be able to let go of the line and just keep hold the hook and fish.
 This takes up slack in the line and brings the hook closer to the fish. Do this until there's only a small gap between the fish's head and the twists in the line.
 Thread the hook point between the two sides of the loop, just above the fish's head.
 If the bridle rig was made correctly, you should be able to use your live bait for hours without it escaping or dying. But let's hope you catch something before then!

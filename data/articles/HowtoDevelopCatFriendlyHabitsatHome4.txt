 Instead, let your cat initiate the interaction. Your cat will approach you and rub its head against your leg or hand if it wants to interact. Hold your hand out and let your cat sniff it. Then proceed to rub its head, cheeks, and chin. You may even talk to it. If your cat shows more interest, then proceed to play with it.Once your cat has ended the interaction, do not force further interaction. Simply wait for your cat to return when it wants attention, or to play with you again.
 Puzzle toys are a great way to provide your cat with mental stimulation. Cardboard boxes, crumpled paper, and ping-pong balls are also great, interactive toys.Choose toys that stimulate predatory play like animated toys, as well as toys that contain fur or feathers. However, make sure to supervise your cat while it is playing with toys that contain feathers, fur, and/or string.
 In general, cats prefer frequent, low intensity playtime with humans. Therefore, play with your cat for 15 minutes twice a day, or for 10 minutes three times day, for example.If work or other obligations prevent you from interacting with your cat on a regular basis, then you may need get another cat (or dog, if itâ€™s a dog-friendly cat) to prevent boredom in your cat.

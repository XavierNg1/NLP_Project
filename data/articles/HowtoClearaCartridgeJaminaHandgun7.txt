 If you experience one, you can tap the stuck round out of the cylinder (carefully, especially if it is an unfired round). You will probably find either a very dirty or corroded cartridge or chamber, or the incorrect caliber round.
 If the cylinder fails to revolve, you probably need to carry the weapon to a qualified gunsmith for mechanical repairs.

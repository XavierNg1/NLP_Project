 Once breast feeding has been established, a pacifier can be introduced. It is generally best to wait until the baby is 3 to 4 weeks old to prevent nipple confusion.
 Breast feeding can be challenging for both you and your baby. When you are stressed, your body may not trigger the let-down response. Additionally, if you are stressed out, your baby will sense your stress and may become agitated. This can make breast feeding even more difficult and start a vicious cycle.
 Good posture is important. Always bring baby up to your breast to prevent strain on your back. Place a pillow on your lap to support the baby and your arms while you hold her up to your breast.

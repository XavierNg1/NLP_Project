 The mixture can be made in the sink while you’re washing dishes. Simply mix a squirt of liquid dish detergent with some water until you have a bubbly cleaner. The soapy water won’t harm stainless steel surfaces or appliances.Commercial products such as Barkeeper’s Friend, Cerama Bryte, Sprayaway, and Weiman are also non-abrasive cleaners that work well on stainless steel.;
, Pick up the soapy water using the cloth. A sponge can be used instead as long as it isn’t an abrasive scrubber. Any abrasive scrubber can end up scratching the steel.
 Look closely at the stainless steel. You’ll notice that its particles form lines going in a certain direction. For example, your steel object will have lines going up and down or left and right. Move the cloth along those lines.When using soft cloths and soapy water, you aren’t likely to scratch the surface if you make a mistake, but it’s a good idea to always try to clean stainless steel along the grain.
 After soaping up the stainless steel, place the same cloth you used under the faucet. Run warm water over it to clear off the soap., Take the rinsed cloth and wipe it over the surface of the stainless steel to remove the soap. Remember to wipe along the grain.
 A clean, soft cloth such as a terrycloth towel will do. Wipe it along the grain to remove the moisture and prevent water stains.

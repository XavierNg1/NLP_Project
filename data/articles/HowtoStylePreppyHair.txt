 Except on formal occasions, long, straight hair is a trademark preppy look. Try to fix those split ends. To make straight hair more interesting, accessorize:


Wear headbands. In Gossip Girl, Blair Waldorf has a signature look: headbands. An athlete's alternative to headbands are headwraps - slip one around your head and tie your hair in a ponytail.






Wear barrettes. Mix and match different colors to keep it interesting and accentuate your girliness.;
, Adding ribbons can bring a personal touch, and can even gain you a signature look. Make sure that the ponytail goes well with your face shape.
 Do this if your hair is naturally wavy and/or to break up the monotony of wearing it straight. Apply some frizz serum or a little mousse to your hair if it's frizzing up. If you use too much product, however, you'll lose the natural look that is characteristic of a preppy â€˜do.
 These should be loose and low under your ears. Tie them with either ribbons that match your outfit or everyday elastics.
 This is a good look for bad hair days. If you feel your outfit is looking a little bland or your hair is being unruly, apply braids liberally. Don't do this if your hair is cut into layers; hair strands sticking out of your braids makes it look more messed up than preppy.
 This is a classic and never goes out of style. Avoid wearing it too high on the head, as this look is not flattering on everyone.
 This adds a bit of a boho-chic look to your preppy style.
 Wear loose or in tight spiral curls for special occasions.

 While any shampoo or conditioner will work, it is better to use moisturizing shampoos and conditioners, especially if your scalp is dry and itchy. Some products such as Shea Moisture African Black Soap Deep Cleansing shampoo and Giovanni Tea Triple Treat shampoo are made specifically for dry scalps and thick hair., Gently massage every inch of the scalp, paying close attention to itchy areas.


If desired, use a basic (or fancy) spray bottle to dilute the shampoo and allow for easier application. In addition to water and shampoo, moisturizer can be added to the bottle if needed., Try not to rub the braids too much, as this can cause frizzing. Instead focus on massaging the scalp., Only this time, after massaging the scalp to rinse it, squeeze the braids to remove deeply-embedded dirt. Rinse once more, gently squeezing the braids to remove excess water., Use fingers to work conditioner into the braids before covering with a shower cap. Let conditioner sit for about 15 minutes before removing the shower cap and rinsing thoroughly., Make sure all of the braids are tucked in, and leave the towel on for ten minutes. After ten minutes, remove the towel and let your hair air dry before applying moisturizer.

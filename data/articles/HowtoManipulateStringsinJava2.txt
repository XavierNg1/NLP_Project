 The length of a string is the number of characters that the string contains. For example, the length of the string "Hello!" is 6 because it has 6 characters.,






int strLength = str.length();





, Here is a sample program that finds the length of a string.






public class StringManipulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "Hello!";
        int strLength = str.length();
        System.out.println("The length of \"" + str + "\" is "
                + strLength + ".");
    }
}

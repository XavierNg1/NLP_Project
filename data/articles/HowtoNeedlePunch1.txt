 Needle punching designs can be purchased already transferred into fabric. You can also draw your own design onto the fabric.


Purchase fabric that is a cotton polyester blend.
Cut the fabric so that 4 inches (10cm) of border remain on all sides of the pattern.
Use a waterproof pen to draw your pattern onto the back of the fabric in the center of the border.;
,, Lock the larger hoop over the top. Make sure the pattern is as tight as possible. Adjust as needed as you punch the design.
 A punch needle contains a hollow shaft and depth gauge. A needle punch has 2 sides, the pointed side contains the eye of the needle and is beveled.


Slide the thread through the eye of the needle into the hollow shaft. Push it through to the other side. Use the color and number of threads required for your pattern.

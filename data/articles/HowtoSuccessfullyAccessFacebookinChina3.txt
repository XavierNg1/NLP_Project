 Tor is a free distributed network that keeps you anonymous while you while you are connected through the browser. Information is bounced between a large number of relays that exist all over the globe. Tor allows you to bypass any firewalls or restrictions placed on your connection. The drawback is that websites load slowly, as the data has to travel great distances to reach you.


The Tor browser bundle is a self-contained program that does not need to be installed. You can place it onto a USB drive and plug it into any computer. The browser bundle is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
 The Tor browser is a modified version of Firefox, and shares a lot of interface similarities with it. When you run the browser program, a window will appear showing the status of the Tor connection. Once the connection is established, the browser will open.


Only traffic sent through the Tor browser will be sent through the Tor network. That means that Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari, or any other browser will not be anonymous through the Tor network while Tor is running.
 Once the browser window opens, you should see a page confirming that you are successfully connected to Tor. You should now be able to access sites that were previously blocked. Closing the browser window will stop Tor from running


While data in the Tor network is encrypted, it cannot decrypt data leaving the Tor network. That means that any secure transactions that you need to make are just as vulnerable as they are on the regular internet. Only give out personal information to sites with SSL enabled. You will see HTTPS:// instead of HTTP:// and your browser address field will display a security lock.

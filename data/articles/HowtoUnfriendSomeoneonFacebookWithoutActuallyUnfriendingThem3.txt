If you aren't currently logged into Facebook, you'll need to enter your email address and password.
 This is the stack of horizontal lines in the bottom right corner of your screen. Doing so will open the Facebook menu.
 This will open your Facebook settings menu.
 This will bring up a few options for editing your News Feed's appearance.
 This will open a menu with a mass list of all of your Facebook friends.
 You can do this by tapping each friend you wish to unfollow; Facebook will not ask for confirmation before unfollowing any tapped friends.

 The mask ingredients described here have astringent properties that clean, tighten, and help heal skin while treating pimples. Astringents can dry out skin, so don’t apply it to already dry areas.However, if you have oily skin, a mask with astringent properties will help normalize your skin’s moisture level.
 In a bowl, mix together 1 tablespoon of honey, 1 egg white, and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. These ingredients have natural properties that will help heal your skin. For example, honey has antibacterial and astringent properties.The egg whites not only thicken the mask, but also act as an astringent, and the lemon juice is both an astringent and a natural bleach/whitening agent., Once you've made your mask base, mix in 1/2 teaspoon of any of the following essential oils:


Peppermint
Spearmint
Lavender
Calendula
Thyme

, Using your fingertips, spread the mixture over your face, your neck, or wherever you're having a problem. This process might get messy, so make sure to do it in an area that can be easily cleaned, like a bathroom. Don't glop on so much of the paste that it will drip off your face or take too long to dry.


If you don't want to apply an entire facial mask, you can use the mixture to spot-treat problem areas. Simply use a Q-tip to apply the mask directly to pimples.
 Depending on how much of the mixture you applied to your face, drying time may vary. However, it should take somewhere around for 15 minutes. Be careful not to let the mask drip everywhere while you're waiting for it to dry.
 After the fifteen minutes have passed and the mixture has dried and had time to work on your skin, it's time to wash it away. Rinse it off completely using lukewarm water and your hands. Don't use a washcloth or sponge that might further irritate your acne skin. Pat your face dry with a clean cotton towel, making sure not to irritate the skin by rubbing.


Apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer to finish.

 Make a list of what you’re looking for in a relationship, such as companionship, partnership, someone to share life events with, someone to talk with, and so on. This will help you figure out if you’re looking for an online or face-to-face relationship. You may discover that you actually want physical companionship as well, which will help you stop being in love with the person you’ll never meet., If you have fallen into a habit of thinking that no one will be attracted to you or that no one in your town or city is available, an Internet relationship can be an easy substitute for dealing with personal issues. Instead of focusing your energies on a relationship, spend that time and energy working on yourself and your self-esteem. Take two minutes every day to quietly think about that which you appreciate about yourself, such as your sense of humor, your eyes, your intellect, or even your shopping savvy.
Make an effort to be kinder to others. You will have a better opinion of yourself the kinder you are to others., Even though this relationship hasn’t met your needs, it was still a good learning experience. Whether you've learned that you can be loved, that your personality is relationship-worthy, or that long-distance relationships are just plain hard sometimes, the important thing is to not let the whole situation be a wasted experience.Consider what was good about your relationship. Was it educational? Or did it help you mature emotionally? Was it nice to have a confidant? Thinking about the positive aspects will help you figure out what you want in future relationships.Similarly, consider what needs you had that weren’t met in the relationship. Was it difficult to coordinate schedules? Or did you have different life goals?
Lastly, consider what did and did not make you happy in your relationship. Thinking about these aspects of your relationship will help you identify your needs and what you want in future relationships.

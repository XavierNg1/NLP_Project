 FRAPS video files are very large, as FRAPS does not do any encoding as it is recording in order to save system resources. If you want to upload the video to YouTube or archive it, you'll likely want to reduce the size by re-encoding the file.
 HandBrake is a free, open source video encoding program. You can use it to quickly convert your FRAPS video files into a much smaller and more compatible format. This will let you watch the files on your various devices or upload it to YouTube. You can download HandBrake for free from handbrake.fr.
 Click the "Source" button in HandBrake and select either "File" or "Folder". You can select an individual file or a folder with multiple videos.
 You'll need to give the converted file a name and select where you want to save it to.
 Most users will not need to adjust any of the settings. The video will convert to MP4 format, which works on many devices. The file size will also be reduced as the video is re-encoded. The time the process will take depends on the length of the video and the speed of your computer.

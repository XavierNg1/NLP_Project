 Studies have shown that taking short, frequent breaks improves your productivity and decreases your boredom.After an hour or so of work, stand up and take a short walk outside or take a cigarette break. Alternatively, go make yourself a fresh cup of coffee and chat with your coworkers. Some other break ideas include:


Volunteering to run an errand. This will help you escape your workplace for a while.
Taking a short nap
Playing your favorite mobile game for a few minutes

, The less boring your environment is, the less bored you’ll be.You can add interest to your surroundings by cleaning your work area, displaying cool artwork, or covering the handles of work-related tools in cute stickers.

For example, if you work in a cubicle or office, add some excitement to your walls with prints and posters.
If you work in retail, buy some new clothes to freshen up your work look.
 Break the monotony of your daily schedule by planning small treats for yourself. For example, plan a small walk around the park during your lunch break. Similarly, you can bring your favorite coffee mug and a tea blend to keep in the break room. Whenever you’re bored or discouraged, pep yourself up with a cup of tea.

Focus on healthy treats and rewards. If you don’t, you may replace your boredom problem with a weight-gain problem.

 Whenever you first put a silencer on a weapon, if you look at the weapons stats with the silencer on it, it'll say in the "range" category (which is the distance the weapon can shoot before the base damage drops. For example, if a weapon's damage is 40-30, it will do 40 damage up to a certain range then it will drop to 30.), there will be a red bar. That bar indicates the factorization of the reduced range that the silencer is causing. However don't get it stuck into your mind that it's impossible to shoot long distance. It just takes a little practice and accuracy.;
, This away you're locked onto the thickest part of the player model, which means you've gotten a better chance at least hitting them.
 Whenever this opportunity rises, take a breath and fire away, but do not "spray" bullets. Single shots or short bursts are recommended. This goes for two reasons. One, you'll waste bullets and give him time to run away or shoot back. Two, because they'll figure out eventually where you are, or possibly one of their teammates, or even both. So be sure to be collective on bullets shot.
 If you don't get a kill off the first time, don't get frustrated, you'll always have next time. You'll eventually get at least one kill before it's all over.

 If you have a sole work place, gather all materials you need and keep them there. If not, gather all you need for your guitar you will be adjusting and replace them afterwards in an organized place. Here is all the tools you may need for all types of commonly played guitars:


Screwdrivers (+) (-)
Hex wrenches
Pliers
Small Crescent Wrench
String Winder
Side-cutters
Ruler (optional)
Manual (optional);
, For Tune-o-Matics, screwdrivers are all that are needed. Individual saddle bridges and floating tremolos much like Strat style bridges need hex wrenches and screw drivers. Floyd Rose and similar only need hex wrenches. Now that you have the proper tools ready you will adjust the action of your guitar by:


using a hex wrench to adjust each saddle of a Strat style bridge, the bolts are small screws inside the saddle, left is down, right is up. Tune down your strings to make rising easier.
using your fingers or a flathead (-) screwdriver to adjust the bridge and/or tailpiece to obtain desired height.
using a handbook and hex wrenches to adjust the mounting screws on Floyd Rose and similar bridges
Using a manual and proper tools to adjust a bridge not listed

, Once you find a desired height, make sure the strings do not hit anything along the span of the strings, including the frets. A little fret buzz on electrics you can get away with but no fret buzz should be present when you play an acoustic. You may use your ruler to find an exact measurement.

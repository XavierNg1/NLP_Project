 There are all sort of light bulbs that create disco-like effects. You can find these at novelty shops or online. There are even some that create the classic disco effect of a rotating field of dots of light. Search online for things like "disco light bulb," “rotating light bulb,” “magic light bulb,” or “color-changing light bulb.”Amazon has a particularly good selection of this sort of item.
Many of these light bulbs come ready for use. You can simply screw them into a compatible socket and start dancing.
 Believe it or not, building a disco light may be as easy as screwing in a light bulb. For instance, remove the cover from a ceiling fixture and replace the regular bulbs with a rotating one. You can also run lamp cords from power sockets to wherever you want to position a disco light bulb.

Resale or thrift stores are a great place to get light fixtures. You can even remove many of the pieces of an old lamp so you just have a cord with a plug on one end and the bulb receptacle on the other.
 Aside from the disco-themed light bulbs, you’ll need a power cord, lamp holders, a lamp holder base, wire nuts, and a back cover for the base if you want the fixture to be free standing. Cut the socket off of the power cord and connect the wires to the lamp holders with the wire nuts. The wire nuts will be tucked behind the lamp holder base.If you have never wired a light fixture before, have someone who has help you out. Though it may seem intimidating, it’s safe and easy to do.
Never work on the wiring of anything that is plugged in. Keep the plug out of the socket whenever you're working on your disco light.

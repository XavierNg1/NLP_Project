 Oftentimes, when their diet is not good enough their fur suffers. If an older animal starts refusing to eat it could be because their food is too hard for their teeth. If you giveÂ the animal hard foods, try changing to a softer food and see if there is improvement.
 Different animals may require certain foods and some might need more work than others to keep them healthy. Try using brands known for being good for your pet and make sure you read the ingredients. Some animal foods don't have what your pet needs and your pet could be lacking essential nutrients because of that.

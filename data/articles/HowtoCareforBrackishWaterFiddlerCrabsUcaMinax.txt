 Fiddlers need room, only two can fit in a 5 gallon (18.9 L) aquarium and only four can fit in a 10 gallon (37.9 L) aquarium. So make sure you get the proper size aquarium.;
,, Brackish water fiddlers thrive in brackish water. Brackish water fiddlers will die in freshwater and saltwater in under two weeks. About 90% land is best. Avoid buying crabs that have been kept underwater. In the 10% water make sure it is just deep enough for them to soak in. Also, it is important to keep them in brackish water; you can marine salt at your local pet store, freshwater aquarium salt will not work.
 Fiddlers will eat freeze dried foods, as well as dead fish, veggies such as cucumber and green bean, and algae and meaty foods. It is recommended to feed your fiddlers a variety of foods.
 Fiddler crabs thrive in temperatures around 75-85, so heaters are recommended. You will need a filter as fiddlers can get some what messy, and an air system will be needed.
, The zoea (zoea is the larvae stage of fiddler crabs) have a complex life. The zoea needs natural foods, natural occurring things like tidal waves and such. But if you provide the following things, you can breed them. You will need a large tank, like a 60–70 gallon (227.1–265.0 L) tank, natural foods like decayed plant matter, and plankton, and if you provide tidal waves and other natural things, and you need to mimic their natural environment, you could breed them. Fiddlers will mate in a normal setup, as long as the temperature and the environment is right. But the zoea won't survive in a normal setup.

 While your computer restarts, press either the F1, F2, or Delete button on your keyboard (right before the welcome screen appears) to access your computer’s BIOS.


BIOS is a blue-white or black-white screen that generally displays basic information and settings of your computer.
 Navigation differs from one BIOS to another, but it isn’t hard to figure out since navigation instructions, such as which keys to use and when to use it, are already displayed on the screen.


On the Boot screen, you only need to change the Boot order so your computer boots from either the DVD or USB, depending whether you’re installing Ubuntu from a DVD or a flash drive.
Save the settings, and your computer will restart again.

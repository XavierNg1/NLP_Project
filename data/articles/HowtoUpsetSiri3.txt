 Siri sometimes responds with confusion to the classic tongue twister, "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck would?" She may respond in confusion or offer a funny response in return, like "I imagine groundhogs would prefer a different question for a change.", Siri becomes upset sometimes if you ask about movies that feature artificial intelligence. She will sometimes respond in a humorous matter if you ask about films like Her and Blade Runner. You can also ask about movies that are simply confusing.

If you ask what Inception is about, for example, Siri responds with, "Inception is about dreaming about dreaming about dreaming about something or other I fell asleep."If you ask about Her, Siri often responds by emphasizing it's just a movie., If you ask Siri what zero divided by zero is, she gives a range of responses. In one response, she uses cookies as an example to explain how the question does not make sense. Her diatribe eventually ends with Siri implying you have no friends.

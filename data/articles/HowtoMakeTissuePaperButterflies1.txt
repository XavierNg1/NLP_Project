 For a more colorful butterfly, cut each square from a different color. This will make the wings.To save time, stack the papers first, and then cut them all at once.;
, Make sure that the corners and edges are aligned. If you are using more than one color, stack them in an order that you like.
 Fold the bottom edge up by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Flip the paper over and fold it up by another inch (2.54 centimeters). Keep flipping and folding in this manner, until you get a fan or accordion.


Keep the papers together while you are folding them. Treat them as one sheet of paper.
Consider cutting a small notch or V-shape into each end of the folded fan/accordion. This will give your butterfly a more interesting design.
 Make sure that you are clipping the clothespin onto the folded edges of the folded paper, and not the top/flat part. The paper will scrunch up a little, but that is okay; when you open it up, you'll have beautiful wings.
 The wings should be sticking out to either side of the clothespin, just like the wings of a butterfly. If they open up more like an umbrella instead, simply twist and rotate them until they are facing the right way


If you'd like, you can gently fluff the wings up too.
 Fold a pipe cleaner in half into a V-shape. Curl each end into a small O-shape or a tight spiral., Position it just above the folded tissue paper. Everything should be fitted snugly in the groove part of the clothespin.
 You can color it with markers or with paints. You can even glue on tiny googly eyes or draw a silly face. To make an extra fancy butterfly, decorate the body with glitter glue and rhinestones.

 When she's lecturing and talking to you, listen attentively, and don't talk back. Accept that you are in the wrong, and that she has the right to lecture you.
 She's only trying to help, and if she wants to talk to you, take the time to listen. Respond to what she's saying and take the time to think about it. You can even reassure her that such an incident will not repeat at the end of your talk, so she knows you thought about it and your apology is genuine.
 When you do answer her questions, don't get an attitude about it. Just answer calmly, directly, and truthfully.


For instance, if your mom says, "What were you thinking?" don't say, "I don't know, obviously I'm an idiot" in a sarcastic tone. Try something more along the lines of "I guess I wasn't thinking very clearly. I'll try to do better next time."

, Doing so will show her you respect her decision.


Your mom isn't yelling at you because she dislikes you or hates you. She cares about you, and she doesn't want you making bad choices which will have an impact on your future. She wants you to be safe and learn to be a better person., Don't be mean, or fling hateful insults. Don't stomp or slam doors. You'll only make her angrier, and later, you'll be sad you acted that way.In addition, your mom will respect your maturity and may forgive you faster.
If she says, "You always say that and don't follow through!" don't argue. Say you understand, and ask for her help in trying to do better in the future.

 Oil based primer will adhere better to the glossy surface of a porcelain knob and will be more resistant to scratches.


Look for a primer designed for use on glossy surfaces.
Avoid using latex primer, as it may scratch off the surface of the knob.
Apply primer using a paintbrush or small foam roller. Apply a light coat to ensure a more even coat and smoother results.
 Follow the directions on the primer container to determine the number of hours required for the primer to dry completely.
 Allow the primer to dry. A second coat will cover any spots you may have missed while applying the first coat of primer.



Apply solid colors using either a paintbrush, small foam roller or spray paint.
Use a paintbrush to add detail of your pattern or design if desired.
Sand lightly with fine grit sandpaper after the first coat of paint if you are painting the knob a solid color and want to achieve a smooth texture.
Apply a second coat of paint.
, Varnish will protect the painted surface from damage.


Choose a varnish compatible with your paint. Use water-based varnishes for latex or acrylic paint and varnishes especially for oil paint if you used oil paint.
Consider what type of finish you want when choosing your varnish. If you want your porcelain knobs to have a glossy sheen, choose semi- or high-gloss. Matte will produce a flat finish and satin will give the knobs a slight sheen.

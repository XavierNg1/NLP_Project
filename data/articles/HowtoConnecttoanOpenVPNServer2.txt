 This will open a new window. Right-click the Tunnelblick.app file and select "Open". Confirm that you want to open the program. Enter your administrator information to install Tunnelblick., Every OpenVPN service should have configuration files available to download. These make setting up Tunnelblick much simpler. You can download the files from your VPN's support page.
 Start Tunnelblick once you've downloaded the files. You'll be prompted to select your new configuration files before the client can start. Click "I have configuration files" and then select "OpenVPN Configuration(s)". If the files are specifically for Tunnelblick, select "Tunnelblick VPN Configuration(s)" instead.

 You may be prompted to download a security certificate upon connecting to the server. You'll need this certificate to connect.

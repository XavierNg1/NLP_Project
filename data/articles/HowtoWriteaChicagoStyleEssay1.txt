 That is, when writing a list of items, include a comma before the “and,”like in this sentence:


“I like strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries.”;
, An em dash symbolizes a change of thought in a sentence or adds extra information to the sentence. When writing a Chicago style paper, do not use a space before or after you use an em dash.For example: “We enjoyed the Fourth of July celebration—all the fireworks were splendid.” The em dash is that long dash in the middle. Microsoft Word generally corrects a double hyphen (--) to an em dash.
 Spell out ‘United States’ unless you are using it as an adjective (for example, U.S. politics). Spell out state names when they follow a city: “We went to Okemah, Oklahoma.”


If you do use an abbreviation for the state, use the standard two-letter postal code.
 While Chicago style is generally not a stickler on this rule, you should try to remember to do this. At the very least, spell out numbers less than 10.


You should also spell out fractions, measurements, and ages.

Statins help lower LDL cholesterol and may also raise your HDL cholesterol.Statins are market under several brands including lovastatin (Altoprev, Mevacor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), and fluvastatin (Lescol).
Side effects of statins are typically mild and include muscle aches and changes in digestive patterns.You should not take statins if you are pregnant.
 Selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors (such as Zetia or ezetimibe) are relatively new drugs that work by keeping your intestines from absorbing cholesterol from food.Side effects of selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors include headache, fatigue, and stomachache., Resins make your liver use up cholesterol to produce increased levels of bile, thus lowering your total cholesterol levels and LDL cholesterol.Resins are marketed under Colestid (colestipol), Welchol (colesevelam) and Questran (cholestyramine sucrose).
Side effects of resins are generally mild and typically include gas, bloating, nausea, stomachache, and heartburn., Lipid-lowering medications help lower triglycerides and LDL cholesterol by inhibiting your body from processing them. Fibrates and niacins are two types of lipid-lowering medications.Side effects of lipid-lowering medications include gas, stomachache, and nausea., If your cholesterol level does not seem to respond to any of these treatment methods, you may want to be evaluated for a genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, and may be a candidate for PCSK9 inhibitors.

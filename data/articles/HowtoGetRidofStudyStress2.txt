 You will not remember all of the material that you are studying if you are sleep deprived. Although it may seem helpful to stay up all night to cram for an exam the next day, you will quickly learn that you are too tired the next day to do a good job on the exam. When you are making your study plan, be sure to schedule in adequate time to rest.


Try to get eight hours of sleep each night.
Take a power nap in the middle of the day for an extra boost in energy. A quick 30 minute nap can really help improve your motivation if you are too tired to be productive.
 Exercise increases your production of endorphins, which is the “feel good” hormone. Exercise can also help to improve your sleep. A regular exercise routine will relieve study stress, as well as other stress that you are managing. Don’t forget to incorporate time to exercise in your daily schedule., It is hard to learn when you are hungry. Don’t miss meals, even if you are trying to save time to spend more time cramming before an exam. You will not be able to retain as much information if you have not had a nutritious meal.

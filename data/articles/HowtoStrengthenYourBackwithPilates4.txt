 This Pilates exercise will stretch out the zones you have worked in the previous exercises and is also great for strengthening your lower back. The breathing is the same as before, again in four breaths.


Change position to sit down with your legs in front of you, hip distance apart.
If you are uncomfortable like this, then sit on a small towel or slightly bend your knees.
 As you inhale, lift up your arms until they are parallel to the floor, palms in.
 Contract your abdominals and simultaneously curve your entire back away from your arms, relaxing your neck.
 Draw the breath into the back of your rib cage, then exhale and reverse the movement, drawing your shoulders down to finish.
 Be sure not to change the height of the arms.

 A regular thermometer should work for this method of finding cold spots, but a higher quality one will give the most accurate reading. Being able to clearly differentiate between temperatures will make it easier to pinpoint cold spots.


Avoid touching the temperature gauge of your thermometer with your hands or fingers. Oil and heat from your hands can influence the temperature reading., Use the same kind of glass for each one. Different glasses may cool down more or less easily and ruin your results. The amount of water in each glass should also be equal. Larger amounts of water cool less quickly than smaller amounts.Fill enough glasses so that each shelf has at least one in each corner of the shelf and another glass in the middle.
 Generally, one glass per shelf corner and one in the middle of each shelf should be sufficient for identifying cold spots. You may have to rearrange items in your fridge to fit the glasses. Once the water is inside, wait for approximately one hour.


You can create a more precise temperature map of your fridge with more glasses. Arrange the glasses around the perimeter of shelves and across the middle of the shelves, left to right, front to back., Once the time is up, take your thermometer and use it to check the temperature of each glass of water. Some glasses will be colder than others. These colder glasses are where the cold spots are.

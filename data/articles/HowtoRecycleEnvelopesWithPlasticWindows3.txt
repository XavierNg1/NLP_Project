 The following are potential uses for old envelopes.

Place seeds in an envelope and label them to store for the winter.






Use envelopes with patterned designs on the inside for art and craft projects.






Tape an envelope beneath a drill to catch falling dust.






Open envelopes with windows carefully and reuse them. You can tape them shut, and cover the window with a mailing label. The UK organization Friends of the Earth sells envelope reuse labels that go over the window or previous mailing address.






If your recycling center won't recycle any envelopes with glue on them, you can remove the plastic window, shred the paper and use it for compost. The glue is usually made from natural, biodegradable materials.






Cut the flap off the envelopes and stack them with the window facing down. Staple them together to make a notepad.

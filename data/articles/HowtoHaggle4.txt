 If you show that you're eager to buy or sell the item, the other party knows they'll be able to get a more attractive price.
 Negotiation is expected when purchasing an expensive item, or when people are trying to get rid of items at a flea market or yard sale. You'll have much less success — and irritate the seller — if you try to bring down the price of a restaurant meal or a bus ticket.


Although the owners of an independent "mom and pop" store have the authority to strike deals, they often have a smaller profit margin and less wiggle room for discounts. If they seem offended by your attempt, don't try to continue haggling.
Larger chains and department stores often have a set policy which may or may not include allowing discounts. If the clerk says they are not authorized to do so, try asking to see someone who is.
 Treat the other negotiator well and they will do the same to you.Careful! This does not mean you have to compliment the item you're intending to buy. Appearing enthusiastic shows the seller you are willing to pay more for it.
 Haggling can be fun, but it's a means to an end. If you've been arguing for ten minutes and neither of you have changed your price, more talking is unlikely to help., Bargaining someone $50 away from their initial offer and then refusing to close a 50¢ gap will make the other party regret doing business with you.
 Especially for small items at a flea market, the vendor knows what they're willing to sell for. If they gave you an honest "best price" answer they'll only be annoyed if you continue to argue.

 Jewelry is always a welcome gift but you don't have to pay a lot for it if you make your own.


Buy an inexpensive cotton cord from the craft store along with some multi-colored beads.

Make paper beads out of gift wrap or their favorite magazines. Just ask their permission first! They are also available in any craft store for a small amount.
Cut 48 inches (121.9Â cm) of the cord and start threading some beads into it. Rub some glue around the sewing tip to make it stiff. You will have a nice long bead necklace for the teenagers and friends on your list.



Get a water bottle and cut around it to make a bangle.
Glue thick ribbon on the inside.
Glue a map to the outside of the bangle, get some Mod Podgeand put 3 to 5 layers over it every 20 minutes, letting it dry between layers.

 It is always a good idea to talk to a doctor before starting any fitness regime. This would especially apply if you have any spinal issues.;
, Have your back straight and your feet a shoulder width apart.
 When you first get start working with an exercise ball, just sit on it. Start very slowly by only using it for an hour or two at first. You will probably find out that you were using new muscles just by doing that.
 Roll it around under your hips in a circular motion and round and round. Anything that is a type of motion.
 You will find that you can stay longer and longer on the ball, but don't overdo it.

 ex. Trees, mushrooms, rocks. By removingÂ obstacles, you will receive a random amount of gems and maybe 10 gems once every so often.;
, By farming, put your town hall on the outside of your base, and your Storage on the inside. This way, attackers will only destroy your town hall for a 1 star and also, you will get a free 12 hour shield.
 Normally, when you attack, you will always find an inactive player (You can tell if they have full collectors and are not in a league) Once you find an inactive base, just drop goblins/archers on their collectors and then surrender (unless there is a town hall to snipe).
 Normally, people wouldn't want to spend real money on gems, but you can get gems/giftcards another way by using apps like FreeMyApps. You can get paid points by doing surveys, or downloading & playing FREE apps (does take about 2 months to get a 10$ app store gift card)

, Take it from the goblins in a singleplayer mission!

, No problem! Just find a base with at least 5000 Dark elixir and Lightning spell their dark elixir storage (or just any storage) Note: This is actually easier in Gold 2 and up.

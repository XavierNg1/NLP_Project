 Place the Zippo in between your pinky and ring finger. The rest of your fingers should be bent. The top of the Zippo will pop out slightly above the top of your fingers., Use your middle finger to push the top of the lighter down while removing the tension in between your ring and pinky fingers. This will cause the lighter to roll over your ring finger and end up in between your ring and middle finger., Do the same motion that you did with the previous finger, but this time with your index finger. This will cause the lighter to roll over your middle finger and land in between your middle finger and index finger., Once your lighter is in between your index and middle fingers, you can use your thumb to press up on the lid and open the lighter. Then, use your thumb to strike the flint wheel to light the Zippo., Once you're done using the lighter, use a strong downward flicking motion to snap the lid of the Zippo closed. This should extinguish the flame., Once the lighter is closed, you can safely roll it back across your fingers, but this time in the opposite direction. Use the same method to roll the lighter back, but this time use your ring finger to do so.Once you become proficient with quickly rolling the lighter back and forth, you can incorporate it into other aspects of your Zippo lighter trick routine.

 This will form the butterfly's wings.
 It is easier to decorate the butterfly in position, as it can't be moved once made.

Place the candy length down the center of the plate. This serves as the butterfly's body.
Place the two wings on opposite sides of the candy, resting on the plate. Face the curve in toward the butterfly's body, the straight edges facing outward.
 The wings can be decorated in any fashion you like. The basics are:

Ice or frost both sides of the cake.
Stick candies onto the cake in symmetrical patterns on each wing (mimic the same pattern, mirror image, both sides).
Sprinkle with edible glitter, sprinkles, or other small cake decorating items.


Use a round candy ball for the head.
Unroll licorice lengths or similar candy to make the antennae––then re-roll the top portion to give it a little curl.

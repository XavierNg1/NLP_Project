 Visit your new locality's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or Department of Transportation (DOT).
 If you have the original title, you will need that. If you don't have it, then take your registration instead. Some states don't require titles on certain vehicles, like older cars.
 In many states, if a lender still holds a lien on your vehicle, then that lender may have the title. Substitute your loan paperwork for your title in this case. Bring the original paperwork if possible.
 This is generally set as a percentage of the value of the vehicle.
 You will have to wait to receive your new title in the mail; new laws designed to prevent title fraud prevent the DMV or DOT from printing your new title immediately. If your new state is a title-holding state, the title will be mailed to your lienholder instead.

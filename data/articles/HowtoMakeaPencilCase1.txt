 Raid the recycling bin for sturdy plastic containers big enough for pencils, pens, and other school or office supplies. Containers from cleaning wipes are large enough to hold most supplies.


Be sure to wash and rinse the container you choose thoroughly before continuing;
, Get all the old labels off the container you chose. Use a butter knife if it's difficult with just your fingers.
 Cut out new labels from sheets of construction paper. You can get creative here or you can just cut out rectangles that will fit on the box. Glue the construction paper labels on your box using a glue stick.


If you wish, you can use the old peeled-off labels as templates for new labels. Trace the labels on the construction paper and cut out the label shapes.
 Use decorative papers, stickers, paint markers, or hand-drawn drawn designs to embellish your box. Use the glue stick or some Elmer's glue to glue decorations on.
 Put all your pencils, pens, highlighters, and other school supplies in the box and you're done!

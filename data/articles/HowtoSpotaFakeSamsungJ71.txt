 The 2016 Samsung J7 was released in four colors—black, white, gold, and rose gold. The 2015 model was only made in black, white, and gold.If the phone is not one of those colors, it’s not an original.;
, The Samsung J7 has two Samsung logos—one on the front (above the screen at the center), and one on the back (at the center, but closer to the top than the bottom). The logos should not be stickers, and should not flake off when you rub them.
 Fake phone manufacturers are pretty good at making their phones look like the real thing, but one foolproof way of checking is to compare your phone to another of the same model. Try these short tests:Locate and press the buttons on the phone. Are they in the same place on both phones? Do they feel the same when pressed?
Stack the phones on top of one another—are they the same size? Look at their edges—a fake J7 is probably thicker than a real one.
Turn the brightness on both phones to the max. Are the colors more bold on one than another?

, Samsung has a few “secret codes” that you can use for troubleshooting. These codes should only work on a Samsung phone.



*#7353#: A menu should appear, containing several options (Melody, Vibration, Speaker, Dimming, etc). If your phone is a Samsung J7, you will see this menu.

*#12580*369#: You should see the “Main version” screen, which shows a bunch of random numbers specific to your phone. If your phone is a Samsung, you’ll see this “Main version” screen.

*#0*#: You should see several gray square buttons (Red, Green, Blue, Receiver, Vibration, etc) on a white background. Again, if nothing happens, the phone is not a Samsung J7.

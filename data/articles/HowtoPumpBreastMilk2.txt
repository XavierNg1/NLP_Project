 Make sure that you have the appropriate-sized shield for your breast. Selecting an inappropriately sized shield can result in failed suction efforts, pain, and irritation.
 Hold the shield in place with one hand and squeeze the mechanism with the other. The milk will begin pumping into the bottle.
 Changing the position of the pump's handle can affect its suction ability, so move it around until you find an appropriate suction level that makes your breast pumping efforts easier.
 Using gravity can help encourage the flow of milk into the container.
 When pumping with a manual pump, it usually takes about 45 minutes.

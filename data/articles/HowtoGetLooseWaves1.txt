 Second-day hair sometimes works better for styling, so if you can, wait a day after washing your hair. This will help your waves stay in place longer.


If your hair is naturally very curly, before continuing. If you want loose waves, you'll need to start with either straight or slightly wavy hair.;
, The larger the barrel, the looser your waves will look. Heat it to the lowest setting required to hold curl in your hair - it's different for everyone. If your hair is on the coarse side, you should be able to use low to medium heat. For fine, straight hair, use medium or high heat.
 This will protect your hair from heat damage and also help your waves stay in place. Choose a spray or serum designed to protect your hair from heat. Avoid gel or mousse-combined with the direct heat, as they'll make your waves look too crunchy and less natural.
 Don't open the clamp of the curling iron, just wrap your hair around the whole thing. This will give you loose waves instead of tighter curls. Hold a section of hair and wrap it near the roots at the base of the barrel, working your way down to the tips. Hold it for about 5 seconds, then release. You should have a wavy, twisty section of hair. Repeat with every section.









Be careful to keep your fingertips away from the curling iron.
If you want more wave around the end of the section, grab it with the curling iron clamp and hold it for a few seconds.
If you have a lot of hair, clip up the top section and start with the back, then work your way forward.
 Don't use a comb or brush, since this will undo your waves. Use your fingers to carefully relax the curls into waves and tousles. Toss your hair and spray it lightly with a flexible hold finishing hair spray if needed.

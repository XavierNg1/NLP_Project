 Sick of painstakingly flossing with your bare hands? A helpful tool called a floss threader can make it easier to get the floss behind your braces. The threader looks similar to a small plastic needle, and it can be used to floss., It’s the same way you would thread a sewing needle. Insert the plastic needle under the archwire of your braces and pull the floss through., Now that it’s in position, grab the floss in your hands and floss down between the teeth. Pull the floss out and repeat with the same threader. The threader is useful for making it easier to get the floss into the correct position without scraping up your fingers.


Be careful when you apply the pressure to get in between your teeth — go gently with a back and forth movement.

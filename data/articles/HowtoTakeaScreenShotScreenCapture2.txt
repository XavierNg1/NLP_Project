 To capture the entire image on your monitor and save it to a file on the desktop, press Command + Shift + 3. You will hear a shutter sound and a file will appear on your desktop containing an image of your entire display. It will be labeled “Screen Shot <date>”.


If you’d rather copy the screenshot to your clipboard instead of saving it to a file, press Command + Control + Shift + 3. The image will be copied to the clipboard, and you can paste it into a document or image editor.
 If you only want to take a screenshot of part of your display, press Command + Shift + 4. The pointer will turn into a small targeting cursor, and you can drag a box that will become the image that is saved. Use this if you only need part of your display saved as a screenshot, or to make sure sensitive information isn’t included in a screenshot.


Once you let go of the mouse, you will hear a shutter sound and the image will be saved to a file on your desktop.
 If you want a screenshot of an entire window, but nothing else, start with the Command + Shift + 4 command. The cursor will change into the targeting reticule. Instead of dragging a box around the window, press Space. This will turn the cursor into a camera icon. Click the window that you want to take a screenshot of.


When you click, you will hear a shutter sound and a file will appear on your desktop containing the screenshot.

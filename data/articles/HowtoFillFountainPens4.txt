 Unlike in cartridge or converter pens, the barrel is not a housing for a cartridge or a converter, but is a reservoir for the ink itself.
 If you have a new pen, or if you are changing colors of ink, clean the barrel using a cotton swab.
 To avoid ink from leaking, youâ€™ll want to create a water-tight seal where the barrel screws into the grip section. Apply silicon grease to the threads. Screw the barrel on, and then screw the barrel off to spread the oil in between the threads.
 Dip the eyedropper into the ink bottle, drawing ink into it. Place the tip of the eyedropper into the upright barrel, and release the ink, filling the barrel. Fill the barrel to the bottom of the threads.


You can also use a syringe instead of an eyedropper.
 Place the grip-section on the barrel, and begin screwing it in.
 Doing this will cause a couple of drops to come out of the feed, priming the pen for writing.
 Use a rag or paper towel to remove any ink still on the nib.

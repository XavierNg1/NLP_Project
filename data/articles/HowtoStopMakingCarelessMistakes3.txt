 Make a list of the most important things in your life, in order. Then, as you’re getting ready to do something, decide how "important" it is. It might be worth it to take a closer at look at how important this action is for you, or if you could use your time more wisely doing something else.


If you’ve made a checklist or to-do list, writing those responsibilities down in their order of importance can also help you figure out which things to do first, second, third, etc., If you’re repeatedly having difficulty managing your responsibilities without making careless mistakes, it may be because you’re trying to do too much. There is a limited amount of time in each day. How many hobbies do you have and how much time do you spend on them?


Having some time to relax and enjoy life is very important, but is your schedule constantly filled up with “fun” commitments that you end up feeling like you don’t even have the time for?
Go back to your list of priorities and make sure you are making enough time to really focus on what is at the top of the list., This is otherwise known as delegating responsibilities. Make sure everyone at home does chores and contributes toward running the household. If there’s a project at work too big for you to do completely on your own, ask others to help you with what they can.

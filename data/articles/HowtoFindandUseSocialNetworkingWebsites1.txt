 Make a list of criteria; maybe wanting to chat about random things, a specific thing, you can even use the internet to find dates!;
, and search what kind of site you're looking for.


If you're under 18, specifically put what age you are in a search. You never know who you're talking to, there could be an internet predator who's wanting to harm you.
 Usually they'll give a small description of what the site is about before you click. Read it, and decide if you like it or not. If you like it from the description, click it and check it out.


Be cautious and use a virus checker before you go onto a website.
Places like Yahoo, Twitter and Facebook are pretty safe, still be cautious and watchful about people you may not know.

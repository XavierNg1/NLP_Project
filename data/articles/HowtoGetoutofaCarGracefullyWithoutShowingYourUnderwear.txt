 Before you even open the door, get your skirt or dress ready for your exit.


If you're wearing a miniskirt, pull the cloth down to cover as much of your thighs as possible.
If you're wearing a longer skirt, dress, or train, pull it down to cover your knees and push any excess fabric toward the center of the car so that it doesn't get caught around your feet when you exit.;
, Don't lean out of the vehicle to open the door, but make sure it's open far enough that you can exit gracefully. If your date or chauffeur opens the door for you, all the better.
 Try to keep your knees together throughout the movement.
, Place your hands on the seat on either side of you, and push yourself up out of the car. Keep your hands low to give yourself better leverage and to appear more graceful. Try to rise smoothly. Alternatively, you can use one hand to boost you up, and the other hand to hold down your skirt flat against your body as you stand.
 Showing your underwear is embarrassing, but hitting your head on the way out of the car is even worse. Gracefully dip under the top of the doorframe.
 If the pavement is uneven, or if there's a curb right next to you, the first step can be disastrous, especially if you're in high heels. Be aware of where you put your feet, and watch your step.

 If you prefer to make potato or meat tacos then cook then whichever way you prefer. The same goes for chicken preparation--any which way is good.

Remove the skin from the chicken and cut it into pieces.



 


Put the water to boil in pot big enough to fit the chicken. Put the following ingredients into the pot: 2 spoons of salt, 1/2 an onion cut into chunks, 3 garlic cloves, 1 teaspoon of oregano, the chicken pieces. Leave the chicken in for about 20 minutes.






Take the chicken out of the pot and make sure it is cooked. If it is not put it back in for a few more minutes. Otherwise let the chicken cool.






Start shredding the pieces of chicken. These strips will go in the taco so make sure the pieces are the right size.

,, Heat up as many as you want to make tacos from.
 Roll it up carefully, making sure no chicken can get out.
 Repeat this until you have finished with all the tortillas and chicken.
 You can also add salsa, beans, or sour cream.

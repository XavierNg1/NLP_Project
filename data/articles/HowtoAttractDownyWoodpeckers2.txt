 You can buy a birdhouse at most home and garden stores.


The birdhouse should have a 4’’ x 4’’ base and sides at least 10’’ high. The hole should be located in the center of one of the sides about 7’’ from the base, and be 1.25’’ in diameter.
Attach the birdhouse to a sturdy tree between eight and twenty feet off the ground. If the birdhouse is in the midst of a woody area, the woodpecker will find it more attractive.
Fill the birdhouse with about four inches of wood shavings. The woodpecker can use these for nesting material.You could also simply leave a dead tree standing in your yard if you don’t want to invest in a birdhouse., Placing some suet balls or suet cakes in the backyard will bring the local downy woodpeckers to you. They also like fruit, sunflower seeds, cracked corn, and doughnuts.


Break any doughnuts you might give to woodpeckers up in small bits before putting them out.
Downies favor suet with peanut butter, millet, or nuts.You can buy premade suet cakes or balls at your local home and garden store.

Covering the second board with a thin layer of sheet metal might make the drumming site more attractive to the woodpeckers.
Drumming is a unique behavior that gives woodpeckers their name.
 While downies are rarely seen at birdbaths, they will use them from time to time.They might also drink from the birdbath.Downies might be more inclined to visit a birdbath during winter when liquid water is scarce.


Instead of drinking from birdbaths, downies tend to drink from puddles, ponds, or places where water collects on horizontal tree limbs.

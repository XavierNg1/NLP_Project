 Put the music of Metallica, Slayer, Machine Head, Lamb of God & more on full blast. Great albums to play on repeat include Metallica's "Master of Puppets", Megadeath's "Rust in Peace" & Slayer's "Reign in Blood".;
, To carry off the Thrash sound, you'll need a group of about 4 or 5 musicians.
 You'll want someone who can perform death growls, bellows & screams, but can also sing in tune too. It's quite commonplace for the singer to play rhythm guitar, but it depends on the amount of energy they want to bring to their performance.
 Rapid-fire staccato solos are a staple of the genre. Someone who channels inspiration from Kerry King's or Kirk Hammett's meaty riffs would be ideal.
 The low-end churn of a 4 or 5-string may get lost under the layers of guitars, but Thrash metal needs more people like the late Cliff Burton. Bassists can always compensate for their lack of sound by going on an extended solo or performing some live vocals.
 The fiery double-bass passages & tom-heavy fills of Lars Ulrich & Dave Lombardo have inspired generations of new rock drummers, so you'll have no problem finding the right sticks-man for the job. They'll need the energy to perform for hours at a time & to be as dexterous with their feet as they are with their hands.
 You'll probably want to play Jackson or ESP Guitars, Fender or Warwick Basses (all with Marshall Amplifiers) & Tama or Pearl Drums. Some artists also get picked up by purveyors of trainers or sports drinks, but they have to take the back seat to the actual music.

 An epitaph can say many things, ranging from details about a person’s life to a quote from religious text. Some might detail the circumstances of a loved one’s death, while others celebrate their life with words from the deceased’s favorite author. Consider your loved one’s personality, life achievements, and style when choosing an epitaph.Consider the size of the monument and the associated font size when choosing an epitaph. For example, a small headstone might not fit the entire religious verse you wish to include.
 The font in which the epitaph and information about your loved one including their name, birthdate, and date of death is inscribed is an important consideration in the overall design of a headstone.Try using a Roman or Old English font for a traditional look.
Reserve italics for epitaphs, including quotes, religious text, and poetry.
 While some families will choose a headstone with strictly text, others may want to include images such as religious iconography, animals, or flowers. These images can reflect your loved one’s tastes, life accomplishments, and religious affiliation.


Most suppliers will have a fairly sizeable library of artwork from which you can choose images for the headstone.
 Once a design is chosen and you have paid the supplier a deposit, they will send you a proof of the headstone to be approved by you and your family. Make sure you go through this important step to avoid ending up with a headstone that meets your expectations. Once you approve the proofs, the supplier will manufacture the headstone.If you don’t like the first proof, ask for another rendering. Most suppliers will provide you with two or three proofs before adding on additional charges.
If the supplier you are working with does not offer a proof, you might want to consider another supplier.

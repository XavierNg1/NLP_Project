 Making rice is a popular use for slow cookers, but can also be one of the more annoying clean-up jobs since rice is prone to sticking. To prevent this, rinse it in a strainer under clean running water. Keep your eye on the runoff and continue rinsing until the draining water turns from milky white to clear.For best results, go with rice that’s marketed as “easy to cook.”;
, Expect most slow cookers to have the same settings (usually “low” and “high”). At the same time, be aware that there is no standard for what these settings actually mean. Anticipate different cooking times and temperatures between any two models. Adjust your recipe’s instructions accordingly to avoid overcooking and burning foods.Unfortunately, this may require some experimentation whenever you try a new recipe.
 Never fill a slow cooker all the way up to the brim. Doing so may cause foods to boil or spill over, even when cooking at low settings. At most, only fill it two-thirds of the way when adding ingredients at the start., Recognize that a slow cooker works by distributing heat evenly. This means that putting too few ingredients inside will cause them to absorb more heat than intended and potentially burn. Whatever you’re cooking, add enough portions to fill the cooker at least halfway to ensure that there’s enough food to absorb heat as intended., Make life easier when trying a new recipe or cooking one that has proven to stick to the inside of your cooker. Insert a plastic liner specifically designed for slow cookers before adding ingredients. Then simply remove it after dishing out your meal for a hassle-free clean-up.Some plastics contain bisphenol A (otherwise known as BPAs), which can be transferred to food during cooking and cause health problems. Before purchasing any brand of slow cooker liners, research whether or not their plastic contains BPAs.

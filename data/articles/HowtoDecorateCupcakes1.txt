 If you want professional looking cupcakes, there's really no way around this. The four most common shapes (openings) are the large round tip, Open star (Wilton 1M), Closed star (Wilton 2D), and the French tip. Rose petal tips (Wilton 123) are useful, too.


You may also want a coupler to hold your tips in place, but it's not necessary. They'll stay in the bag if you do it right. However, having one lets you interchange several decorating tips without changing the bag.;
, There are several varieties and all will get the job done. If you're thinking about seriously getting into cupcake decorating, go for the sturdy, reusable ones. If not, the disposable kind work just as well.Featherweight bags are reusable, made of flexible, coated polyester. They are strong, lightweight and dishwasher safe, in sizes from 8 in. to 18 in.
Disposable bags are made to use and tossâ€”no fuss, no muss. Made of strong, flexible plastic, they're easy to handle. Available in 12, 24, 50 and 100 count boxes.
Parchment Triangles are also disposable, but you have to fold them into shape. They're made of vegetable parchment paper (grease resistant, too!) and they come in 12" and 15" sizes.
 While piping bags and tips are enough, sometimes you want a little more variety. If you want to work with fondant or ganache, you'll need a few more materials.


A palette knife is handy for spreading and evening out pretty much any type of icing or frosting.
A spatula is especially useful for working with fondant.
A cooking grid almost goes without saying!

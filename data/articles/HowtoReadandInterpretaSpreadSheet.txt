 In the present day, a spreadsheet is used to organize data in boxes (known as cells).

Spreadsheets are sometimes just glorified lists detailing names and numbers. Other times, they add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers and percentages to make data make sense.

, Think in lines. Data is presented either horizontally, vertically, or both.

A typical spreadsheet looks like a table with names or categories on the left or right going down (vertically) and another set of names or categories on the top or bottom going across (horizontally). The data is represented in between this area.






To find a particular data point, follow one vertical category that you need to a horizontal category that you need on the same line.
 You have to understand what is happening in each cell. Sometimes data is just a number that means something to someone. Other times, data is a calculation based on other data. This can be as simple as a sum of data points, or as complicated as finding the average of certain data points and comparing them to other averages. It's just a matter of who has created the spreadsheet and what their intention is.

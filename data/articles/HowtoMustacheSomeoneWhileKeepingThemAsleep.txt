 This is optional, however.;
, Marker works best. If this is just a prank, use a washable marker and test it on your hand first to make sure it's washable. If this is payback, and you won't get in trouble or ruin this person's day, you can use non-washable marker. But don't use sharpie. That stuff can take days to come off! You could also use an eyeliner pen or lipstick (you'd probably need black lipstick!)

, Don't laugh, hint, or show the marker.
 You wanna wait for just the right moment. Even after he/she has fallen asleep, you need to let them sleep for 10-20 minutes (depending on the sleeper) to give them time to fall into a deep sleep. It can even take an hour or so! Maybe set an alarm but make it silent, only letting it vibrate,

, Try to resist laughing. You can let out a quiet giggle every now and then (depending how heavy he or she sleeps) but try to avoid laughing and talking at all costs.
 Be sure to write lightly rather then pressing down the pen or you may wake who ever you are doing this to up.
 In the morning, they will laugh and give it away if they are not aware that you drew on one person's face.
 If it stays secret, the prey will only discover the mustache or drawing when they go to the bathroom.

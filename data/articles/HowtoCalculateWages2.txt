 Tipped employees, including waiters and waitresses, earn a substantial part of their income through tips. These tips cannot be directly calculated or predicted. When you are hired, your employer may offer you any competitive rate or may choose to apply the minimum wage for your state.As of January 1, 2017, the federal minimum wage for tipped employees is $2.13. This is calculated by starting at the regular minimum wage of $7.25 and subtracting a credit of $5.12 per hour. Essentially, the government is assuming that you will earn at least $5.12 each hour in tips. 

Eight states do not make any deduction to the minimum wage for tipped employees. Twenty-eight states or territories do apply a tip deduction, but still have minimum wages higher than the federal rate. Eighteen states use the federal tipped employee minimum of $2.13.

 Use your employer’s record keeping system for recording the hours you work. You may also wish to keep your own separate record to compare with your paycheck., Different companies or employers may have a variety of policies for handling tips. Some places will pool the tips among all staff and then divide them evenly. Others will just allow you to collect your own tips from your work station. Follow your employer’s system. At the end of each day, you should count and record the amount of tips that you received.

Because tips often come in cash, it is tempting just to grab the money and go at the end of the night. But if you are concerned with counting your wages, you should keep a record.

Customers who pay with credit cards will often tip that way as well. You need to learn your employer’s system for crediting you with these tips. For example, the credit card tips may just be calculated in the computer and added to your paycheck each week.
 To find your base pay, multiply your number of hours worked by your pay rate.

For example, suppose you work in Ohio, where the tipped employee minimum wage is $4.08. You earn that wage, and work for 40 hours in a given week. Your base pay is therefore 40∗$4.08=$163.20{\displaystyle 40*\$4.08=\$163.20}.

If you want to estimate your annual pay, multiply this result by 50 weeks per year. This will account for about two weeks of unpaid vacation or sick time. Working with the above example, this results in $163.20∗50=$8,160.00{\displaystyle \$163.20*50=\$8,160.00}.
 If you are trying to calculate your wages for one particular week, keep track of the tips that you earned that week. Add the total of your tips to your calculated base pay.

Suppose the employee in the previous example, with base pay of $163.20, collected tips during the week that amounted to $532.00. This person’s total wages would then be $163.20+$532.00=$695.20{\displaystyle \$163.20+\$532.00=\$695.20}.

To extend this example to an annual estimate, multiply the weekly result by 50. This assumes that your tips will be steady throughout the year. For this example, the annual estimate will be $695.20∗50=$34,760.00{\displaystyle \$695.20*50=\$34,760.00}.
 If you wish, you can figure out your hourly rate for the week, with base pay and tips combined. Simply divide your total calculated wages by the number of hours that you worked.

For the ongoing example, if the tips and wages totaled $695.20, and you worked 40 hours, the hourly rate would be $695.20/40=$17.38{\displaystyle \$695.20/40=\$17.38}.
 The IRS requires tipped employees to keep an accurate, daily record of tips received through the month. By the 10th of the next month, you are then supposed to report this total to your employer. Your employer may require you to report tips more frequently. Your employer will use this figure to calculate your withholdings for taxes, Social Security and Medicare. Your employer will report all this information to the IRS.You do not need to report tips if they total less than $20 per month.

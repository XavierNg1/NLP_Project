 While Apple doesn't provide an app or capabilities to download YouTube videos to your iPod Touch, Cydia (the jailbroken equivalent to the app store) does.
 Once you have jailbroken your iPod, open the Cydia app. Cydia is the equivalent to Apple's app store and works much the same.
 The search bar works just like Apples. It looks like a magnifying glass and allows you to search for applications.
 Once you have found the application labeled MxTube press the install and then the confirm button to complete the installation.
 MxTube should be on the last page of apps on your iPod, but it may be located on another page depending on how your apps are sorted.;
, MxTube opens just like any other applications. Simply tap it once for it to open.
 Once MxTube is open, use the search bar to find videos.
 Once you have found a video you want to watch, select it and scroll down to the area that gives you options to either view or download the video.


Depending on how the video was uploaded, MxTube will provide you several quality options for viewing/downloading. Remember, the higher the quality, the longer it will take to load.
 Once videos have been downloaded to your iPod Touch, exit the search and view window and return to the MxTube home screen. (This can alternatively be done by hitting the home button and reopening MxTube) At the home screen you will see a list of all videos you have downloaded. Enjoy!

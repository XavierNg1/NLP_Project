 Create special Halloween foods like:


Eyeball olives (or grapes)
Wing of bat chips
Hair of werewolf angel hair pasta
Fingers of man mini-corn dogs
Potato salad with baby potatoes carved as skulls (paint the eye and nose sockets along with the grin with either Chinese soy or edible coloring - it is a lot of work, but on the bright side, kids eat less than adults).
 Some ideas include:


Pumpkin seeds
Funky fingers
Pumpkin pie
Smores
Jack cookies.
 For example, have spooky Halloween punch or blood punch.

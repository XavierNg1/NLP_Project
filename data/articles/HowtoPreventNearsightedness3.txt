 One way to possibly prevent nearsightedness is to have your eyes tested for any issues. If you havenâ€™t had your eyes tested in a long time, schedule an appointment. If you notice anything off about your eyesight, get tested by your optometrist.

You can also use the appointment as an opportunity to talk about any concerns about your eyesight you may be having with the optometrist.
 In some cases, getting reading glasses or contacts with a low prescription can help to reduce your chances of developing nearsightedness. Speak to your optometrist about reading glasses or contacts as one way of preventing nearsightedness.The effectiveness of reading glasses or low prescription contacts for preventing nearsightedness is still up for debate. Some optometrists argue that this option will not improve your eyesight or reduce your chances of becoming nearsighted.
 If you already have eyeglasses or contacts, going for regular check ups will ensure your eyesight does not get worse.

Try to have regular check ups with the optometrist every six to eight months to maintain your eyesight.

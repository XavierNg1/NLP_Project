 Even if you are dressing for an indoor occasion that might not require a full-length ensemble, make sure you have full-length layers for those times you will be outdoors. Wear a jacket that comes down to the wrists at the sleeves and up to the base of the neck, and make sure pants come down to the ankles.Help fill in gaps in coverage by wearing long wool socks at the feet, gloves on your hands, and a scarf around your neck. Expose as little of your skin as possible to the cold.
If you are wearing a dress and worry about windburn while in transit, consider wearing fleece-lined or wool tights, which can be integrated into your outfit or removed easily at your venue.
If you have an occasion where you need or wish to wear shorts indoors, bring a separate pair of pants to change into for those times when you will have to be outside.;
, Ears are especially susceptible to windburn, so it is important to keep them covered. Use earmuffs or a hat with a brim or flaps long enough to cover your ears. You may also consider a warm headband, such as a fleece-lined headband, as an alternative to keep your ears and your forehead warm.If you are going to be out in the cold for long periods of time, it may be worth investing in a full-face cover such as a ski hood or balaclava, that covers everything except the eyes.
Full face covers can be purchased easily online or through most sporting goods stores.
 The skin around the eyes is especially thin and sensitive, so it is important to offer them a shield from the elements. Wear sunglasses when you are out during the day, and consider non-prescription lenses or goggles when you are at night.Sport style sunglasses are particularly useful as they have wide lenses that curve slightly around the side of the face, offering extra protection. These can be found at most sporting goods stores.

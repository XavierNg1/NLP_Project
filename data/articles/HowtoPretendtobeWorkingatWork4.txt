 Always socialize with your colleagues and coworkers, making it seem as if you're part of the team. In a worst case scenario, they will not denounce you if they think you're one of them. Give them the chance to chill at work occasionally too; simply don't notice the snores or the glazed eyes, and smile and nod, saying "Good work, Alice, keep it up."

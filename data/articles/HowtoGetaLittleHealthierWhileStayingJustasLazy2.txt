 Just two minutes...you can do it! You can even walk in circles around your couch while you watch TV. Walking will help you burn extra calories that would have been stored as fat, had you stayed sitting., Be sure to look behind you. Walking backwards, even in short bursts, may have huge health benefits. Walking backwards will also work different muscles than walking forwards., If you have things to do, such as laundry, taking out the trash, or other chores, do them earlier rather than later. This will kickstart your metabolism., You can still play video games or watch TV, but try to stand for at least half of the time youâ€™re doing so. You can burn up to 750 more calories every week if you stand for 3 hours a day!

 Just as you expect your friends to respect your beliefs, you should be tolerant of theirs. You do not have to agree with your friends, but you should avoid talking badly about them or their beliefs. Remain positive and agree to disagree on any touchy subjects.For example, if you say “I'll be praying for you,” to a friend who then responds “Thanks, but I’m atheist,” resist the urge to lecture them. Instead, respond by saying something like “I understand, but I still hope you feel better.”

, Whether you are engaging a friend or a stranger, you should avoid getting into heated arguments about your Christianity (or their lack of it). This only leads to both sides being angry and showing disrespect. If you sense that a conversation is getting to the point that both sides are no longer able to discuss it peaceably, end the conversation and walk away.For example, if you were to be in a discussion with a non-Christian friend and the two of you started insisting that the other was wrong and misguided, it is time to step away from the conversation. Say something like “We obviously disagree. I don’t see any point in arguing about it.”

, You should remember that you have no more ability to control your friends beliefs than they have to control yours. Even if you feel that they are mistaken in what they believe, your non-Christian friends do have the right to exercise their free will. As their friend, it is your responsibility to respect those choices and allow them to be who they are.For example, if you have a friend that prefers not to go to church, you cannot force them to go. You can invite them once in awhile, but be prepared for them to decline your offer. If they do decline, leave the invitation open by saying something like “If you change your mind, just let me know.”

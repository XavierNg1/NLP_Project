 Gifts can help to brighten your partner's day. They don't need to be big things. Sometimes the most memorable gifts are given when they are least expected. While it's still wise to give your partner gifts on holidays and special occasions, think about these ways to show you care on ordinary days:Be creative. Draw, write, or get crafty. Consider painting a picture of your partner's favorite flower, or a place they like to visit.
Find something that they love. Whether it's music, games, sports, movies, or something else, think about what would make them happy.
Give your talents. Play a song for them. Make them a delicious meal. Decorate a space to fit their tastes.
 Communicating your love with kind words will make your partner feel valued and appreciated. This can be done in person, via text, over a phone call, or through email. No matter the form of communication, it's important to tell them how you feel.When you see your partner and they look nice, express that with words. Consider saying, "You look so beautiful tonight" or "You look so lovely, as always."
If your partner is working hard, then make sure to respond with positive words. Say something like, "I love how hard you're working" or "You really are doing an amazing job."
Avoid talking about what you dislike about their appearance, or how they are doing something poorly. To be romantic you need to avoid nit-picking.
 Acts of kindness can be very romantic to your partner. They show that you care. Doing favors or helping out with chores are acts of caring that remind your partner how loving you are. Consider these actions to show you care:


Help with tasks around the home. Do some extra chores that need to be done.
Go the extra mile when your partner is stressed. For example, make them a special dinner.
Share your time or skills with your partner. For example, if you're good at fixing things, then work a project that needs to be fixed for them.

 Any vegetable oil or olive oil will work.


Add a bit of butter to the oil if you want the outsides of the chops to brown well.
 Many pork chop recipes call for rosemary, garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, paprika or sage.



Finish the chops off in the oven if you are saut√®ing particularly thick pork chops. After browning them on each side, let them cook off in a hot oven until they are done.

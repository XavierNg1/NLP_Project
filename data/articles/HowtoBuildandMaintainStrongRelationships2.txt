 How often have you lost a close friend because you “just grew apart”? It's common to lose contact with people as we get older and our interests change, but some relationships are strong enough to survive this test of time. This is because these relationships are not based primarily on common interests.


Shifting the base of the relationship to something a bit deeper, such as an admiration, or an appreciation for that particular individual allows one to accept small differences in interests, likes and dislikes. By focusing the relationship on the other person and not the things associated with them, we gain the ability to respect them and their individuality.
 “Relationships function like a mirror--eventually that change will reflect back onto how you are treated.” -Lolly Daskal, President, and CEO, Lead From Within. This quote is pretty self-explanatory. There is no quicker way to weaken a relationship than by not being able to respect those around you.


Conversely, respect can be gained by being considerate of others. This does not mean you have to agree with everything your boss says or see eye-to-eye with your siblings, but being able to calmly acknowledge and set aside differences helps people overcome otherwise troublesome differences.
 If the other person in the relation doesn't respect you, it can hardly be considered healthy. However, many people find if difficult to respect those who cannot respect themselves. If you are able to stand up for yourself in difficult situations and express when aspects of a relationship are negatively impacting you, then you greatly improve communication in a relationship and set up a sturdier, healthier relationship dynamic. In this situation, both people are able to function independently but choose to work together, as opposed to one relying on the other to stand up for them.

 To hide cuts, scrapes, or scratches, purchase concealer makeup and an angled eyeliner brush (available at pharmacies or beauty supply stores). Apply the concealer with the brush just along the cut, making the line as fine as possible.Apply a light dusting of translucent powder over the area to set the makeup and prevent it from rubbing off.Always use a clean brush and only apply makeup to a closed wound.
 Clothing is one of the simplest and most effective ways to cover up cuts on your body. Long sleeves and pants (or long skirts) will hide cuts or scrapes while they heal. In warm weather, balance your outfit by wearing less-covering items of clothing on areas of your body that do not have blemishes.For instance, if you wear longs sleeves to hide cuts or scrapes on your arms, wear shorts to balance out your look.
Be sure that your clothing is loose enough to give your cuts space to heal.
 Temporary tattoos can be a fun way to cover your cuts once they have closed over. Purchase temporary tattoos at a beauty supply store or make your own temporary tattoos using eyeliner. After a few days, be sure to remove temporary tattoos as gently as possible with a gentle soap and water., To hide your cuts in plain sight, make your own colorful bandages with decorative tape (available at craft stores or online). Attach a strip of colorful tape to the non-adhesive side of the bandage and trim away the excess tape around the edges. Apply it to your cut as you would a regular band-aid.

 It can be overwhelming to respond to backers and manage your campaign. Pre-write emails for the beginning, middle, and end of your project. This way, you can simply copy, paste, and add the backer's name to a message instead of typing an original email to each and every backer as they contribute.You usually get the most backers at the beginning and end of a project. At least have some pre-written language available for these two time periods.
A thank you for becoming a backer email or message is always a nice touch.
You can also write a frequently asked question email before you start your campaign or based on feedback that you have gotten about your campaign.
 It is important that you communicate with your backers regularly and let them know when they can expect to hear from you. Choose intervals that make sense for your campaign and project timeline. If your project is only 6 weeks long, you may do weekly updates and respond to messages a a few times a week. If your project is 6 months long, you may do monthly updates and send messages once a week.At the end of your update, you may say, "I'll be back with an update next Friday," or "Check out my YouTube channel next Friday. I'll have a special video for you guys!"

, If you do not respond to messages in a timely fashion, your backers may become irritated or even think that your project is some type of scam. Schedule time to respond to messages and comments.This time should be treated like any other important meeting or task that you need to do.


You will probably need to schedule more time at the beginning of your campaign and at the end of your campaign.
At the end of each message, encourage your backers to share your project with other people.
Personally responding to each message is time consuming, but it is the best way to connect with your audience.

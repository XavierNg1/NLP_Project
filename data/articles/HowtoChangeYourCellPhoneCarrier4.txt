 When you sign up for a new service, you will always receive a new SIM card. This card will have a new number when you receive it, but you will be transferring your old number to your new SIM card, overriding the new number.


Check with your existing service while shopping for new ones to see if they will match any deals you might find. This could end up saving you a lot of time and hassle.
 This code will allow you to transfer your old number to your new SIM. Service providers have to provide this code to you within two hours of you asking for it. You may be offered deals to try to keep you on the same network.


Most service providers will send you your PAC via text, though some may give it to you over the phone. Others may send it through traditional post.
 If you store contact information on your SIM card, they will need to be backed up so that you can transfer them to your new one. You will also need to use any prepaid minutes before your old SIM card is deactivated, otherwise they will be lost.
 Contact your new provider and order your new SIM or phone deal. Give them your PAC and the new provider will handle the phone number transfer process. You can usually schedule a day that you want to the activation process to occur. Pick a day that you most likely wonâ€™t be using your phone much.The transfer process can take as long as 24 hours or as little as a few minutes. Typically it will happen in about an hour.

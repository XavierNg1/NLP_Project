, In doing this, there are several things to take great care with:


1. Do not let children anywhere near this.
2. Do not let any of the fabric trail onto the heating element. This is why you must use a high pot. Alternately, remove the pot from the heat and work quickly so as not to lose the steam.
3. Treat boiling with great care, as you already do.
 Let the steam work through the stain. The stain should disappear.

Do your research about what styles work for your hair type and face. While it's not impossible to have a good hair day with opposing hair types and styles, it does mean more work for you.
Choose a style that you're willing to maintain and keep your hair at a manageable length. You might start having bad hair days when your preferred style grows out for too long.
 A great haircut that suits your face will grow out well and should make maintenance easier. Make sure you trust your hair stylist, especially if you're dramatically changing your look.


If you're frequently having bad hair days, you might be overdue for a haircut. This is especially true if you notice split ends or limp hair that tangles easily., Maintaining your haircut every six to eight weeks will keep your hair healthy and tamable.This can prevent split ends that can contribute to frizzy hair.


Seeing your stylist frequently is an added bonus. Not only will your hair get the treatment it needs, but you'll also build a rapport with your stylist. This can help when it comes to getting a last-minute appointment or dramatically changing your hairstyle.
 Your stylist should be able to recommend products for your hair type and style. Avoid using too much product, as it can build up and make styling difficult.


Nourish your hair by waiting a day or two in between shampoos, using conditioners effectively, and avoiding damaging practices, such as daily flat-ironing or prolonged blow drying.

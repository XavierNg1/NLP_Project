 This is perhaps the most obvious, but most effective way to spend less on wine. If you usually have 2 glasses of wine - perhaps 1 with dinner and 1 afterwards - cut down to drinking only 1 glass. Successfully reducing your drinking in this way will immediately cut your wine spending in half!;
, Most grocery stores today stock a wide range of inexpensive wines that offer surprisingly good quality. Begin trying wines that are slightly below the price you normally consider the appropriate minimum. You may be surprised to find that you can't tell the difference at all between your usual wines and more inexpensive varieties.
 Boxed wine, historically stigmatized as unacceptably low quality, has enjoyed a bit of a resurgence recently. Respectable vineyards have begun packaging quality wines in boxed form. Checking out these wines can help save you money - a 3 liter (0.8 US gal) box of wine is the equivalent of 4 regular wine bottles, and usually features a lower price per volume.
 If you have a penchant for French, Italian, or fine Napa Valley wines, you could consider broadening your tastes to include more affordable regions. Chile, Argentina, and Australia all produce quality wines that carry a much lower price tag than many French favorites. Sourcing wine from within your own country is also a good way to find affordable bottles.
 If you don't mind the large initial cash outlay, buying wine by the case is one of the best ways to save money. Many grocery stores and specialty resellers will offer discounts if wine is purchased by the case. Some stores will even offer a discount if you buy 6 mix-and-matched bottles from their shelves.
 It is no secret that wine in restaurants is precipitously marked up in price. If you frequently buy wine in restaurants, consider scaling back. At the least, take advantage of inexpensive house wines, low per-bottle prices, or bring your own wine and simply pay a modest corkage fee.

 First impressions matter, but can you tell that the person has put time and effort into this painting? Remember to be fair because we are not all natural-born artists! When evaluating a painting, get some background information on the artist. If you are evaluating a student (for teachers) then consider other artwork the student has done.;
, Consider the theme of this painting. Does it have a unique theme, or is it a common idea? If it is different, appreciate that the artist is trying to be unique.Consider other artwork the person has done to look for a theme in the paintings. Themes can include:


Abstract
Cubism
Portraits
Landscapes

, If the painting has a common theme, consider how well it interprets the work of others.
 The quality of the painting is very important. The ideas behind it can be very creative, but the painting itself has to be up to par. Quality depends on the medium you use, and the type of canvas. To evaluate quality, consider:


Is the painting sloppy? (Messy lines, fading paint traces, paint marks all over the painting)
Has the paint been well-mixed together?

, Do the colours complement each other or contrast each other? Does this work well with the painting?

, Is the painting well-proportioned or are there blotches of paint and shapes in random corners of the painting? You have to look at the painting from further away and see if the painting is balanced. Also, consider the sizes of the images in the painting. Are they big/small enough? Do you have to squint to see the images?

, Is there detail in the painting?

 Find friends that enjoy the same things you do or think similarly to you. Feel free to ask your friends what they think about certain tv shows, drinking, smoking, sex, classmates, and themselves. The more you know about someone, the easier it will be for you to decide whether she will make a good friend or not., You may find it difficult to become friends with popular kids and if you do, you may find it extremely difficult to keep the friendship because they may have many options and only be concerned with staying popular. They try to keep their status and may not be trustworthy or worth investing your time.
 It may be easiest to keep friends with similar schedules or who live close to you. Friends who play the same sports or who participate in the same clubs make it easier for you to see and interact with them frequently.

Keeping friends in different schools may be difficult but you can schedule hanging out with them during the weekends, share an interest, or meet them to do an activity.
 Grow your newly formed friendship by taking it slow, being available, and by not being needy.Friendship should develop at your own pace. Don’t rush into anything.
Allow your friendship to grow by making time for your friend.
Avoid being needy. Being needy can turn off any friend. Don’t be relentless with your attempts to become friends.

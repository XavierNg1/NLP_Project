 They must have incredible memory, so if you do not, this will be harder for you. People mistake spies for being quiet and mysterious. Actually, I find it helps if you are very outgoing and always with the most popular people, to get the good information and find who to spy on.
 If there is somebody you don't like, there is always something about a person they don't want you to know. This is what I call their 'Red', or their red light, the thing that is secret, and, sometimes, utterly humiliating.
 You can't go on a mission, hoping everything will work out, because, guess what? It doesn't. A good plan would include: Start time, end time, who controls what, who controls who, cover story, and, obviously, your well-thought-out, full proof plan. A good spy thinks ahead, and has no fear or doubts.

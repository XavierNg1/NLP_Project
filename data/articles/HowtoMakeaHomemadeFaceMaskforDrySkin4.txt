 In a large bowl, combine 10 fresh strawberries, ¼ cup (85 g) of bee pollen, 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of raw honey, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil mayonnaise, and several drops of lavender essential oil. Combine the ingredients with a whisk until they’re all fully incorporated.Strawberries contain vitamin C and are rich in alpha hydroxy acids, which help exfoliate dry, dead skin cells.
Bee pollen granules, which you can find at health food stores, also help exfoliate dry skin, so the moisturizing honey can more easily penetrate the skin.
The olive oil mayo helps moisturize and soften the skin, while also delivering powerful antioxidants.
The lavender essential oil gives the mask an aromatherapy component. If you don’t like the scent of lavender, use your favorite essential oil to scent the mask.
 When the ingredients are fully mixed, use your fingers to carefully smooth it over your face. Once it’s applied, lie down and relax for approximately 20 minutes so you can get the maximum benefits from the mask.When you’re applying the mask, be careful to avoid the eye area.
 When your 20 minutes are up, use a washcloth dampened with warm water to gently remove the mask. Rinse your face with lukewarm water, and follow up with your favorite moisturizer.

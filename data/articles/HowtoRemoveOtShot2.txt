 There are several programs available online that will scan your computer for programs like OtShot and remove them for you. You may want to download more than one, because some programs catch things that others donâ€™t. Popular programs include:


Spybot Search and Destroy
Revo Uninstaller
Malwarebytes Anti-Malware
HitmanPro

, All of the programs listed above will need to scan your system before you can remove OtShot. Depending on the size and speed of your computer, this scan may take a while. The exception to this is Revo Uninstaller, which asks to you to designate which program you wish to uninstall.The downside to this is that Revo Uninstaller will not automatically find any other programs that you may be infected with.
 Once the scan is complete, OtShot should appear on the list of programs that need to be removed. Follow the instructions for your program of choice to remove it. Some will delete the files, while others will quarantine the files to be deleted later.
 To make sure that the uninstallation finalizes, reboot your computer. OtShot should no longer be present on your system. If you still have issues with OtShot, try downloading one of the other programs listed above and repeat these steps.

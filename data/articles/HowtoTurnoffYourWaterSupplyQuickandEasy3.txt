 Most companies will allow you to access the shutoff valve. There are only three main reasonsto shut off the street water cutoff:


Your inside water shutoff fails and you have an emergency, such as a burst pipe.
There is a leak in the pipe between the street shutoff and the house shutoff valve.
You are replacing the main shutoff valve inside your home.
 Many houses have a water meter and shut off valve located together, generally in a box with an access cover between the street and the home.
 These covers can be quite heavy and difficult to open by design. You may need a wrench with a long extension to access valves that are deeper. This is common practice in the north where the weather is colder.
 These are the two possible types of shutoffs that you may encounter. The type of valve with a handle is called a ball valve. The kind with a more circular handle is called a gate valve.
 Make sure the valve is all the way closed so there is no more water flowing to house. These valves can lock up if they have not been used recently.


If a valve will not turn with a reasonable amount of pressure, do not force the valve. Call a licensed plumber or public works to assist you.
 If you see a valve with metal flange, you may have to make use of a pipe wrench to turn it. When the valve is on, the handle will be aligned with the pipe. When the handle is at a right angle to the pipe the water is off., However, keep in mind that there will still be water inside the house. You will need to drain simply by turning on every one of the faucets. This procedure should include shower or bath fixtures as well.

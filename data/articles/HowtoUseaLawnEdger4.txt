 Mark out where you want your new lawn edges to go using string on pegs (this is best for square or oblong beds), chalk, or a spray can of paint.


Following the instructions for using your edging tool, use your lawn edger to define the new edges of the bed.
 Once you've cut and made visible one full line of the bed’s new edge, return to the start of your turf cut. Now you want to make another cut about one inch closer to the bed.


Make the second cut at a slight angle towards the first cut you made. The idea is to make a thin strip of turf for easy removal.
 Once you have cut the whole length, get down on your knees. If you’ve made a severing cut through the turf, you should be able to pull up the long one inch wide strip of turf easily.
 Now take a spade and dig out whatever remains of the turf on the bed side of your turf line. This will complete the expansion of your bed.


If you are mulching your beds, rake out the mulch to fill the new area of bed.

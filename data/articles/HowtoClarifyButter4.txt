, Melt the butter slowly at mid-power until you see the three layers develop (top foamy solids; middle clear yellow liquid; and bottom heavy solids).

 Insert it into the middle layer and suck the clear yellow liquid (clarified butter) from the glass.
 Repeat until all the clarified butter is extracted, leaving the solids behind.

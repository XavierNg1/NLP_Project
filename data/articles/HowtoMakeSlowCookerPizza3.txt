 Spray a slow cooker insert with cooking spray and place it in a 6 quart (5.7 liter) slow cooker. Get out 1 can (16.3 ounces or 462 g) of refrigerated biscuits and open it. Remove the 8 biscuits and cut each biscuit into 6 pieces. Put the biscuits in a large mixing bowl.You can use a sharp knife or kitchen shears to cut the biscuits.
 Measure out 1 cup (150 g) of sliced pepperoni and cut each slice into 4 pieces. Add the pepperoni to the mixing bowl with the biscuits and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning over it. Stir the mixture, so the biscuits are coated.If you don't have Italian seasoning, you can use a mixture of dried sage, oregano, rosemary, thyme, and marjoram to equal 1 tablespoon.
 Dump the seasoned biscuits and pepperoni into the prepared slow-cooker and pour 1 cup (225 g) of pizza sauce evenly over it. Spread 2 cups (200 g or 8 ounces) of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.For an extra-rich pizza, consider sprinkle extra chopped pepperoni over the top of the pull-apart pizza bake.
 Unroll a long piece of paper towel, so you can lay it across the entire length of the slow cooker. Set the lid on the slow cooker, so the paper towel is held in place. Cook the bake on HIGH for 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours. Check to see if the bake is done by sticking a knife into the center of the bake. The knife should come out clean and the edges of the bake should be golden. Carefully lift the insert out of the slow cooker and remove the bake.The paper towel will catch any of the moisture from the lid. This will prevent it from dripping onto the pizza, which could make it soggy.

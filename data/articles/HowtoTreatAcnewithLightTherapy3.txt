 There are several light therapy devices you can use at home to treat acne. For instance, talk to your doctor about getting Tanda Clear Acne Light Therapy Treatment, a blue light therapy that has a successful track record and has no side effects. At-home light therapy devices can prevent acne outbreaks from occurring and reduce the number of blackheads, whiteheads, pustules, and nodules on your face.Light therapy devices you can use at home are less powerful than the ones used by your doctor.Typically, at-home light therapy devices require you to use them for about 45 minutes every other day.
Devices typically cost between $150-$350.
Ask your doctor for advice about choosing an at-home light therapy device.
Use directions vary with manufacturer. Consult your light therapy device’s instructions for more information.
 Photopneumatic therapy combines intense pulsed light (IPL) with a vacuum. This process can remove excess oil and dead skin cells from your pores. However, it will not treat acne cysts or nodules. Your doctor will decide if photopneumatic therapy is right for you.As is the case with regular light therapy, you'll need multiple photopneumatic therapy treatments in order to see any improvement in your condition.
If you receive an IPL treatment, you might experience side effects similar to those you would if you received a regular light treatment. Additionally, you might have a temporary sensitivity to sunlight.
Photopneumatic therapy is FDA-approved.
 Light therapy treatment for acne does not work for all people. In fact, for some people, light therapy is no more effective than common over-the-counter acne treatments.Everyone has a slightly different body and your experience with light therapy might not be the same as someone else’s. Additionally, you might only see an improvement in your acne, not a complete elimination.If you do not experience a reduction in acne severity, talk to your doctor about alternative treatments in follow-up appointments. Your doctor may suggest Accutane or a similar treatment.

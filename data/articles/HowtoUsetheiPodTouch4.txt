, Safari is Apple's default web browser, similar to Internet Explorer, Firefox and Google Chrome. A menu with available WiFi networks will pop up, if you haven't already enabled one through the Settings button.,, Once you tap in these boxes, a QWERTY keyboard will pop up from the bottom of the screen, allowing you to enter letters.
 There are five buttons at the bottom of the screen. You'll use these to navigate around the browser, as you would on a regular computer.


The arrows are to move backward or forward to pages you've already visited. The left-pointing arrow is back; the right-pointing arrow is forward.
The arrow coming out of the square opens an options menu. From here, you can add bookmarks, mail links, tweet, or print.
The open book provides access to your bookmarks. Bookmark your favorite pages using the options menu.
The layered squares on the far right allow you to open multiple windows. If you want to look up another site without losing the page you already have open, tap this button and hit New Page in the lower left corner. You can scroll between pages by swiping your finger left or right. Close unwanted pages by tapping the red X in the upper left corner. Tap Done when you are finished.

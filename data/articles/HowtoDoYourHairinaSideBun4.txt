 Start at the base your head. Continue in a downward motion. As you twist your hair, let it roll into a spiral. Keep twisting the hair, allowing it to wind around the upper sections of the ponytail.
 Use an elastic band. Fasten the bottom portion of the bun to the beginning of the ponytail. Your hair should look like a complex spiral hanging from the side of your head. There will be tufts of hair poking out.
 Pin long stands of hair sticking out to the base of your head. Bobby pins work best for this. Use additional bobby pins to fasten the sides of the bun to your head, as well. Spray with hairspray for a long-lasting hold.








If any loose strands begin to poke out, pin them into the bun.

 It will be easier if you have everything ready and a space cleared. You'll need:

A frame with glass






Copied images you like






Krylon looking glass spray paint






Paintbrush






Scissors






White glue







, Yep, the fronts. You'll be adhering the pretty side of the images to the front of the glass. This is easiest if you put the glue in a plastic bowl and use a paintbrush to spread. It needs to be a thin, even layer.


Don't use too much glue! If anything, use too little. You don't want globs of glue all over your mirror. When you're applying the glue, place an old newspaper down on your surface -- you also don't want glue all over your table.
 If it wasn't clear, remove the glass from the frame to do this. Make sure the glass is clean before you apply the images! Just wipe it down with a bit of glass cleaner and a clean cloth.
 The smell is quite intoxicating (literally), so you'll want to be outside in an open area. Apply several layers and spray as evenly as possible.


Let it dry for 15 minutes. After the time is up, flip it over and see what it looks like underneath! If you're unhappy with the results, apply some more spray.
 Reinsert the back and secure all the sides. Ta da! Hang on a wall or display on a shelf.

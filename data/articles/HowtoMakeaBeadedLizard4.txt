 Put three beads on the left string, remembering to alternate them if you're doing a two-colored body. Then slide the right string in the opposite direction as the left and pull the two ends to slide the beads up to the body.









You need three more rows before starting the feet again.
 After the three lengths of the body, add two more legs. The process is identical.
 You should have the process down pat by now. Two beads on the left string, feed through the right string and pull tight.
 The tail is simply the same process as the body, but its only one bead per layer. You can choose any color you want. Alternating looks great too, and you can use as many beads as you want for the length of tail you like.
 You can tie any knot you want, but a simple square knot will do just fine. You can use the knot used to tie your shoes as well, but make sure you double knot it.

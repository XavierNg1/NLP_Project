 Before you start preparing your baked hush puppies, turn the oven on to 425 degrees F (218.3 C). Prepare a large baking sheet by spraying it with cooking spray or greasing it using the end of a stick of butter., Combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, cayenne and salt in a bowl. Whisk using a fork or whisk to mix the ingredients.You can also add Old Bay if you want your hush puppies to have a more herbal flavor.
 In another mixing bowl, add the egg and the milk. Whisk using a whisk or spoon until the ingredients are fully combined and the egg yolk is incorporated into the mixture., Finely dice half of a large, sweet onion, such as a Vidalia onion, and add it to the mixing bowl of dry ingredients. Stir the onion into the mixture.A sweet onion doesn’t overpower the subtle cornmeal flavor of the hush puppies. You can use a stronger onion such as a white onion if you want a sharper flavor.
 Slowly pour the egg yolk mixture into the bowl of dry ingredients. Use a spatula or spoon to fold the egg mixture in, scooping the mixture from the bottom and folding it over on itself until the ingredients are combined.Folding the mixture as opposed to rapidly stirring makes the hush puppies lighter and less dense.
 Once you have combined the ingredients, use your hands to lightly shape the batter into small balls, then place them on the baking sheet. Space them evenly so that they don’t stick to each other while cooking.

Aim to make the hush puppies around the size of a golf ball. Remember that they will expand when they bake.
 Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, take the tray of hush puppies out and brush them with oil. Give them a sprinkle of salt and Old Bay if you are using it., After you brush the hush puppies, place them back in the oven for 3 more minutes. Then take them out of the oven and serve them while still warm!

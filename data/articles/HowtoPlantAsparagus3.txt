 Prepare a bed 4 feet (1.2 m) wide. Remove all traces of weeds and grass from the bed, making sure there are no roots left behind in the soil. Till the soil and rake in manure, compost, blood or bone meal at a depth of 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 cm).


Dig trenches for planting. Trenches should be 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) deep and around 12 inches (30 cm) wide. If you are planting multiple rows, space the trenches 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) apart.






Make ridges in the trenches. Mix the soil that you removed from the trenches with organic compost, and spread 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7 cm) of the enriched soil into the bottom center of each trench to form a center ridge.






You can also mix in rock phosphate, a mineral powder that encourages root growth.
 Place the crowns in a bucket of either warm water or a compost tea (fortified with plant nutrients) for about 15 minutes before planting.
 Place the crowns in the trenches, spacing them 18 inches (30 to 45 cm) apart. Drape the roots over the sides of the ridges.


Cover the roots and crowns with soil. Place soil over the roots and over the crowns by 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7 cm).
Water the area thoroughly after you are done planting.
 As the asparagus plants begin to grow and the soil settles, add more soil over the crowns. Place 1 to 3 inches (2 to 7 cm) of soil over the crowns every 2 to 3 weeks until the trenches are filled to ground level.
 Spread 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 cm) of mulch around the plants after the trench has been filled. Mulching the plants helps to keep weeds down and helps retain soil moisture.

 Pigeons won't appreciate the force or concentration of the water being targeted at them. Spray the birds when they first arrive. If you wait until they set up house, it will be too late., Place them where the pigeons usually roost. Be aware that pigeons will grow used to the presence of mute raptors that “perch” in the same location.For good measure, move the decoy on a regular basis.
 When the sun hits reflective objects, it creates a prism effect that interferes with the birds' eyesight. Install reflective tape or foil balloons to scare away the pigeons. If money is tight, string old CDs from nearby trees or along awnings.

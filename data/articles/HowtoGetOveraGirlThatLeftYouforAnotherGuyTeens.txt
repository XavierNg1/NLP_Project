 Best girl in the world? Never met, and never will meet another like her? It's common to feel this way, but trust us, it probably is not true. So let your friends talk trash about her. Remind yourself of the annoying things she did. Do what you need to do to remind yourself that nobody's perfect, especially her.;
, Relationships end. It happens, and beating yourself up about it or trying to "solve" something about yourself will only make the heartache worse. Instead, try to accept that it was more about her than it was about you.
 This can be a tough one. But dwelling on the "ifs" and "buts" and "whys" is helpful to no one, especially yourself. Find ways to get her out of your mind.
 Re-engage interests or people you missed out on while dating or pursuing Ms. Queen Bee. Join a sports team. Call up an old friend. Read a good book. Enjoy your own life and you will worry less about hers. After all, the best revenge is living well.
 Hit the gym, go running, eat good foods. Keeping your body healthy is scientifically proven to help keep your mind happy, and that's really what this is all about.
 You never know why people do the things they do. Obsessing over the guy she found will only make your own pain worse.
 Take some time and get your mind right, and then remind yourself that you will have plenty of other chances. Relationships are an adventure, and sometimes they do not end well. But there are plenty more of them out there, waiting to happen. Learn from them, and make them what you will.

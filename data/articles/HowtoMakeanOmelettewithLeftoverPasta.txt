 Thoroughly mix the leftover pasta in a large bowl, adding 1 egg per portion of pasta. Salt and pepper to your taste.;
, Use a pan of adequate size so that the mix is about 1 inch (2.5Â cm) thick, grease it with just a little olive oil, cook it very very slowly until the mix becomes solid and the first side is browned

, Turn over the omelette as you usually do, possibly with the help of a dish since at this stage is still fragile and may break

, When both sides are lightly browned, remove from heat and let it cool a little, then cut it in wedges.
 Place the freshly made omelette onto a plate and add sauce such as ketchup or hot sauce to spice things up.

 This pose looks similar to dolphin pose, except that it places stress on your wrists, rather than on your forearms. In downward facing dog, you extend your arms as well as your legs so that you rely on your hands, wrists and feet for support.
 This pose relies on the fact that you can plant your hands on the floor with your arms extended, supporting your body weight. This position places a lot of tension on your wrist, and can squeeze your median nerve, leading to a burning sensation in your hands and wrists.


This is also considered the push-up position.
 This pose involves sitting on a yoga mat and then brining your right foot to your right armpit, then turning to your left and planting both of your palms on the floor. From there, you lean your body forward, letting your right elbow rest on your left thigh, and you stand on both of your wrists so that your whole body weight is on your wrists.As such, it can greatly exacerbate symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.

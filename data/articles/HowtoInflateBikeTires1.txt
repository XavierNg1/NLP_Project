 The valve stem is surrounded by a threaded valve core; to press down on the stem, you need to use a tool like a pen cap or your thumbnail. Schrader valves are typically wider in diameter and shorter than Presta or Woods valves. They're usually found on cars, less expensive bikes and mountain bikes. To open a Schrader valve, simply unscrew the rubber cap at the top.






;
, This is usually on raised print on the side of your bike tires and will consist of a range. Don't let your PSI go any lower than the lowest number; the high number is the recommended maximum PSI.
 If you don't already have one, try to use a gas station pump, or borrow one from a friend.









If you have a Schrader valve, you're in luck - you won't need an adapter to use a gas station pump. Ask the attendant for a pressure gauge and inflate your tires in small bursts, checking the pressure after each one. Gas station pumps are extremely high pressure, and you can pop your tires if you're not careful.
If you're using a bicycle pump with two openings, the larger one is meant for the Schrader valve.
Smart pumps with one opening will automatically adjust to accommodate a Schrader valve.
A pump with one opening may require you to reverse an internal rubber stop to fit a Schrader valve. Unscrew the face cap and find the rubber stop. The larger end should be facing out for a Schrader valve.
 Unscrew the rubber cap on top of the valve and put it somewhere safe, like your back pocket. You don't want to lose it.









Put the pump on the valve. If there's a lever near the nozzle, make sure it's in the open position (parallel to the nozzle) when you're putting it on the valve; snap the lever down into the closed position (perpendicular to the nozzle) when it's on. Keep an eye on the PSI as you pump.
Flip the lever back up to remove the pump, then quickly return the rubber cap to the valve.

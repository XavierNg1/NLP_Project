 Since the road kept is fully paved and kept largely clean of debris, a road or touring bicycle is recommended. Hybrid or mountain bikes will certainly work, but the rider must work harder.;
, Do you want to ride it alone or with a group? Those choosing to ride it alone should create contingency plans for unsafe conditions and check in regularly with someone who is monitoring their well-being. Riding it with a group is usually a better idea. You can either recruit friends or others from your local cycling club, or find an existing event to join. The Fuller Center Bicycle Adventure (http://www.fullercenterbikeadventure.org), for example, organizes an annual 1-week fully-supported group ride.
 There are no mountains on the Trace, but there are some moderate to large hills. If possible, your training should include climbing. You should train with at least the same number of miles in each week as you intend to ride. For example, if you intend to average 65 miles (105 km) per day on the Trace, you should train at least 65 miles (105 km) per week. Those who are younger will find that their bodies can adapt more quickly to the distance than those who are older, so older riders may wish to further increase their training regimine.
 The great thing about joining an event is that most of the preparations you will need are already taken care of by the event organizers. This includes emergency support, places to stay, rest stops, and all food. It also may include a ride back to where you started so that you do need to bike all the way back. Be sure to read all the material that the event sends to you ahead of the trip and to pack and prepare accordingly.
 No matter how difficult it seems on the trail, if you do not stop pedaling, you will eventually reach your destination! Keep on going: you can do it.

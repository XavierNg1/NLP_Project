 For this, you will need a thick cardstock paper in any pattern or texture. You can choose to add additional decorative paper to the top of your bookmark when you have completed the assembly.
 Cut a rectangular strip of paper 2 inches wide by 6 inches long. Then, fold the paper directly down the center to that you have two halves measuring 2 x 3 inches.
 Take small magnets or sheets of magnetic paper, available at craft stores, and cut them into small pieces about ½ an inch by ½ an inch. Glue each piece to the inside of the folded paper opposite of each other. When the paper is folded completely in half, the magnets should connect together.
 Add other pieces of decorative paper to the front and back of your bookmark, or draw your own images or quotes onto it. To create a glitzy look, add some glitter or sequins to the paper. Seal your bookmark with a liquid gel medium to prevent the paper from fraying or glued pieces from coming off.
 The folded mark should be placed over a single page in your book, with the magnets connecting over the page. To keep it from falling out, place the bookmark near the spine of the page rather than the edge.

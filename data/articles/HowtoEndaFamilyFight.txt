 If you really want to help your family by bringing them both together, getting another trusted family member involved.Always seeking help from people, friends, or advisors shows weakness try it by yourself.


Ask a friend to help. If your friend knows the people involved and is trusted by them, he or she may be a good person to choose to help mediate the conflict.
Consider calling for external help if you can't find someone closer to assist, such as ChildLine for 0800 1111.
 Listen closely and be open to ideas. Where possible think outside the box to try to help your family members find solutions.
 Talk to one family member and record the conversation. Then play it to the other side of the family. Doing so may give them an idea of how things have escalated to such a level of tension.
 Write a list of answers, and do this for the other side. Don't exaggerate and hide things––write everything down word by word.
 Write how you have seen the differences in the 'broken' family.
 Request that they all talk about how they feel. Suggest gently that you think it would be best for all if they could find it in their hearts to forgive each other.


Have a teddy or a piece of card saying 'SPEAK'. Only allow the person holding this item to talk.
 Try to seem modest, in all ways.
 Suggest to the family member that they might like to consider letting go of the issue and start over. Ask them whether they have considered the consequences of not doing so, such as keeping the other family members away from each other all the time during such times as Christmas, birthdays, parties.

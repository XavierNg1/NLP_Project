 Rioters look in windows for high-price items to loot. If you have a big TV and entertainment center right in front of your picture window, your house becomes a target. Move these items out of sight or hang some thick curtains.If people canâ€™t see what you have, that may be enough to make them keep walking past your house.
 Since glass is so fragile, windows are the primary place for looters to enter your house. Attaching stickable security film to your windows keeps them from completely shattering if they are hit. Anything that slows rioters down is a good defense.The strong adhesive holds onto the glass shards, which makes it harder to climb in your windows.
 You may want to keep some security features on hand without actually installing them right away. Get plywood boards and cut them to fit all of your easily accessible windows. Keep them on hand for extreme situations.Store them in the shed so you can get to them and hang them up if you see unrest starting to build.
Keep a box of nails and a hammer close by the boards. Keep in mind that nailing wood to your house may damage the siding. You have to weigh the pros and cons of that type of security feature.

 Look for the Google app on your mobile device. It’s the one with the app icon with the Google, or “g,” logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 Tap your profile picture or menu icon on the upper left corner of the home screen to open the Settings window. Tap on “Search settings” from here.
 Look for the SafeSearch Filters section, and tap the option for “Show most relevant results” to disable SafeSearch. The other option here is “Filter explicit results,” which would essentially enable SafeSearch.
 Tap the “Save” button at the bottom of the window, then tap the “Done” button on the upper right corner of the next window. You will be taken back to Google Search with SafeSearch off.

 Choose your vase not only based on room design but also the number of coins you would like to use. Also, take into consideration not only the number, but size of the coins. Larger coins can command a larger amount of space.;
, Determine which coins will make it onto the vase and which coins you’d rather either cash in or save. Add and/or subtract to your collection based on your project requirements.
 You’ll need matte black spray paint, hot glue gun and glue sticks and newspaper to cover surfaces.


Cover flat surface with newspaper and spray paint the entire surface of the vase. Only cover the outside of the vase and consider painting two coats, allowing ample dry time between the two.






Heat the glue gun toward the end of the second coat’s dry time to allow it enough time to heat up.
 Add a dab of glue to one side of the coin and adhere it to the top, rim of the vase. Work your way around the rim with the coins until you reach the end.
 You should have evenly spaced rows of coins, completely covering the vase. Work your way downward until coins cover the vase all the way to the base.

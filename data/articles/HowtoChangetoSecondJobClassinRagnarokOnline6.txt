 Father Thomas is in Prontera Church (prt_church 16, 41). Talk to him to sign up to be a priest. He will tell how the quest is going to be and what your first task is.

If you are at job level 50, you can skip the first part of the test, and then he will warp you to Father Peter directly.
If you’re not yet level 50, your first task is to pay a visit, in this order, to Father Rubalkabara, Mother Marthilda, and Father Yosuke. All Priests can be found inside the church.
After you have spoken to all 3 Priests, go back to Father Thomas, and he will warp you to Father Peter.
You must be an Acolyte with a job level 40 or higher to start this quest.
 In the quest room, enter the chat box on top of Father Peter's head to start the test. There are 3 parts of the test:

In the first part, you have to kill all the zombies in the room.
In the second part, you will be presented to a series of monsters disguised as NPCs (such as Dark Lord, Baphomet, etc). Each will tempt you to the dark side. Resist the temptation and answer their tempting deals with common sense as a servant of God (choose “Devil, be gone”' for most part). If you accepted their deal, you will be warped to some place and have to retake the second test again.
In the third part, you will be in a room filled with mummies. You are not required to kill any of them. Simply make it to the exit to pass the test.
Remember, you have to pass all 3 rooms within 5 minutes.
After passing the test, you will be warped back to the church.
 Sister Cecil will ask a series of questions to determine if you are suitable to handle the job as Priest. Simply answer the question with common sense as Priest.

If you get any of the question wrong, she will stop you. You can talk to her again to take the test once more.
Once you passed, return to Father Thomas, and he will change you into a priest.
If you're at job level 50, you will get a Bible. Otherwise, you will be given a Book.

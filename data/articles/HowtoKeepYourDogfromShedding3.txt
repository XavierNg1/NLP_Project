 If your dog is shedding too much, visit your veterinarian to rule out health problems. The vet can run tests to determine if a medical issue like a dietary deficiency, hormonal imbalance, or parasites are the cause of your pet’s shedding, and treat it accordingly. Be sure to advise them about any recent changes to your dog’s diet, behavior, or living situation., Monitor your dog for signs of fleas by looking out for scratching and skin irritation, and check its fur for dark brown-black insects, which can sometimes be seen moving on your pet’s skin. When grooming your dog, run a fine comb through its fur, close to the skin, and tap it onto a white piece of paper to make fleas visible. If you see fleas, bring your pet to the veterinarian right away to find out the best treatment options., Food intolerances or allergies can cause a host of skin problems in dogs and affect the health of their coat. Regular, commercial dog food is often made with low-quality ingredients like corn, soy, and low-grade meat. Shop for a minimally-processed dog food, or supplement your dog’s regular food with whole foods to offer it a more well-balanced diet.

 Fabric pre-conditioner might not be found in your average grocery store, so you may have to purchase it online if you can’t find it elsewhere. It’s used to dissolve and loosen soiled debris and oil for easier removal during shampooing.


Spot-test the preconditioner on a spot of the sofa that isn’t readily viewable to make sure it doesn’t result in discoloration.
Spray the pre-conditioner over all the sofa surfaces you plan to shampoo.
 Mix 3 ounces of your water-based detergent with 3 ounces of water in a bowl or other container.
 Dip a rag into the solution and rub it on a little-seen portion of the sofa. You can use the same spot you tested the preconditioner on.


Let the solution sit on the fabric for 10 minutes, then check it.
Press a paper towel to the spot to see if any of the fabric’s dye comes off on it.
If there’s no discoloration, move on to the next step.
 Different models of steam vacuums might look different, so this step will provide very general instructions.


Locate the tank on your team vacuum, and unscrew the cap that keeps the liquid in.
Pour the solution of fabric shampoo and water into the tank, then replace the lid.
Attach the hose if it’s not permanently attached.
Attach the stair/upholstery attachment to the end of the hose.
 Keeping the button depressed, move across the surface of the sofa in a grid pattern, just as you did with the vacuum cleaner earlier. Make sure you apply the shampoo to the entire sofa.


Move slowly to ensure even distribution of the shampoo.
 Release the button that applies the shampoo. Move the nozzle across the surface of the sofa once more this way, sucking up excess detergent back into the vacuum.
 If there are particular spots that need extra shampooing, spot-treat them with the nozzle. However, don’t over-shampoo any area, as it can result in permanent discoloration.
 No amount of vacuuming with the button released will dry the fabric out. Just leave the sofa alone until it air dries completely.

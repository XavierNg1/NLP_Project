 You should monitor your skin for any signs of infection after your dermal fillers. Notice any pain or tenderness that is accompanied by warm skin and swelling near the injection site. Check to see if an area looks different than other areas that have been treated. An infected area may also develop abscesses or nodules filled with pus or that are covered with crust.Additionally, infection can be identified by fever and/or redness.
 You should contact the doctor who performed the procedure if you notice any redness, swelling, or tenderness after the day of the injection. The doctor will perform a physical exam, where they check the site of the injection for infection. They will also ask you how long it has been since your injection, because that can help them determine the type of infection.If you canâ€™t go to the doctor who did your injections, visit your regular doctor.
 Your doctor may take a culture from the infected area to determine what type of infection you have and the proper kind of antibiotics to prescribe. The most common type of infection from dermal fillers is bacterial, but you can also have fungal or viral infections.

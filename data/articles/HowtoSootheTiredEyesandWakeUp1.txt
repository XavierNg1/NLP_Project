 Splashing cold water on your face doesnâ€™t actually wake you up directly. Instead, this initially causes constriction or narrowing of facial arteries, so you are actually decreasing the blood flow to your face. This lack of blood flow sets off a nervous system reflex to become more alert and fight to get out of this environment.


Reduction of blood flow to the eyes reduces inflammation to the eyes.
Natural tears are produced when your eyes are closed during this period of time. With prolonged periods of being awake, eyes can become dry and tired. Strategies that increase eye closure reduce dryness and spread tear film.
Test the water temperature before splashing. The water should be cold but not freezing.
Splash the water at least three times to get results. Keep in mind, however, that you will only get slight relief from this method. Too few splashes may cause no change at all.;
, Intensify your cold water wake-up by putting cold water in a bowl and putting your face into it for 30 seconds. Take a deep breath before submerging your face in the water. Take your face out of the water as soon as you need to get air.


If any pain or other symptoms occur, stop this method immediately and contact your doctor.

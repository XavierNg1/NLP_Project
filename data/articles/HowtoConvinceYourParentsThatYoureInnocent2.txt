 Making eye contact with your parents is incredibly important; eye contact establishes trust and makes you look alert and interested in the conversation.By not making eye-contact, you are essentially proving that you are guilty of the crime.
Hold the eye contact, even when you feel uncomfortable. Looking away or avoiding eye contact will make you look guilty.
 Standing completely still suggests a deer in headlights and may further convince your parents that you’re guilty. Move around, but do so naturally – if you don’t usually gesture with your hands when you talk, don’t start using excessive hand gestures now.Don’t cross your arms over your chest. This makes you look closed off and threatening, but not trustworthy.
Don’t touch or cover your mouth. This implies that you don’t know what to say.
Don’t fidget. Fidgeting only makes you look guilty and anxious.
 Facial cues are an easy way to detect if someone is being dishonest and a fake smile usually points to a guilty person. When smiling, concentrate on smiling with your whole face.Crinkle your eyes when smiling. This makes your smile look more genuine.
Don’t smirk. Smirking usually suggests that someone is being disingenuous.

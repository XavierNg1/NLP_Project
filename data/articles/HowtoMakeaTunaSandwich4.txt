 It’s important to let the broiler warm up for several minutes before you toast the bread, otherwise it may cook unevenly.


You can find the “broil” setting on the far end of the oven-temperature dial on most ovens.
 The number of times you drain and rinse it is up to you, but draining and rinsing it at least once is recommended.


Use a can opener to open the can, but don’t remove the lid.
Holding the lid in place, flip the can over and hold it over the sink until all the liquid has drained.
Remove the top of the can, and be careful not to cut yourself.
Take the tuna out of the can and place it in a strainer or colander.
Rinse the tuna thoroughly with water, then press the water out using a clean hand or a paper towel.
 In a medium bowl, mix together tuna, shallot, mayonnaise, lemon juice, parsley, salt, hot sauce, and pepper.


Stir to combine.
Stir thoroughly so that all ingredients are evenly distributed.
 Spread 1/4 of the tuna mix onto each of 4 bread slices. Top with cheese and tomato.


You can substitute in any variety of sandwich bread, or you may use a roll or croissant in the place of sandwich bread.
 Place the slices of bread and tuna mix onto a baking sheet and broil in the oven for 3 to 5 minutes. or until cheese is melted.


Remove from the oven, turn off the broiler, and serve.

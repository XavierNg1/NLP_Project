 Anatomy resides inside the body. If you have the opportunity, watch or participate in a dissection. Try to study the cadaver as much as possible, relating what you have recently studied to what you see before you.Discuss this with your labmates and listen to what they have to say, so as not to miss out on any insight. Try not to skip any dissection labs, even though you may not enjoy doing them. Little else can give you this hands-on experience.
If you are truly opposed to human dissection, ask your teacher for guidance finding an online dissection module. This allows you to digitally dissect the body without actually having to work with a cadaver.
 Anatomy books focus on the average human condition, but no individual is going to completely align with the average condition. Take a look while you are in the lab at what may be different than in your book to get an understanding of what is normal and what is abnormal.Talk with your teacher about your observations. Ask them, “If a certain condition is considered average, is what I observed considered abnormal or problematic?”
Always follow up by asking, “Why is that?” so that you understand not only how certain parts of the body may differ, but also why.
 You are likely graded on your lab reports, but you should think of them as a tool for your as well as a grade. Write in-depth, well-researched lab reports that contains not only the information requested by your teacher, but also information you find valuable.Your report should include your hypothesis, your tests, your raw data, and your interpretations of the data.
Use your data interpretation to include information from your course and from other sources such as peer-reviewed journals and monographs. Make notes of why you think what you think in your lab report.

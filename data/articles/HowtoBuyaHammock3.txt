 Using a search engine can help you locate hammock stores or shops that are willing to ship a hammock to you.
As with most purchases, you will need to be wary of a few things:


Sporting goods stores will offer a limited selection of hammocks, but these will likely be available at a lower price point than a specialty hammock shop. The trade-off is that hammock shops are far more likely to have higher-quality items that are more comfortable and durable than what you would find at other locations.
Ordering a hammock from a faraway city—or even a different country—will require paying a postage charge that could push the cost of your purchase beyond what you want to spend. Be mindful of where your search takes you, and ask yourself if you’re willing to foot the extra shipping charge.
Some hammock stores have a wide variety of rope and fabric styles, while others offer limited selection. If you’re looking for a particular style of hammock, you may need to broaden your search to include places outside your immediate area.
 With the growth of online commerce, the number of sites devoted to product and retailer reviews has also exploded. Taking the time to review a particular brand of hammock or a retailer you’re considering is a great way to provide extra peace of mind and avoid ending up with a subpar product. It’s just as important to make sure you visit several review sites rather than rely on one or two.
 Make sure you comb every bit of information provided on the site before making your final decision. Take the time to call the store directly if you don’t find all of the answers you seek.
 Online merchants often accept debit card, credit card, e-check or some alternate form of payment. Go over all of the charges before closing the purchase to make sure you aren’t being overcharged.

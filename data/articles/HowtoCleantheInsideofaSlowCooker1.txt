 While some manufactured cleaners meant for ovens and grills can be used on the inside of your slow cooker, be sure to read the warnings and directions before purchasing or using them. Check to make sure the product is safe to use on the material in question (in the case of a slow cooker, this is often aluminium).Look for items specifically labeled as non-abrasive cleaners, or simply use vinegar as a cleaner if you are in doubt.If you are unsure of the material used inside your slow cooker, contact the manufacturer or visit their website to find out, or consider an alternate method.
Be advised that many manufacturers do not include instructions for cleaning the inside of the cooker. Instead, they recommended professional servicing.;
, Expect the fumes from such cleaners to be toxic when inhaled and/or simply overpowering in smell. If possible, clean your slow cooker outdoors for the best air circulation. If this is not possible, choose a space with open windows, exhaust fans, and/or a strong cross-breeze.Although this is a general rule when using chemicals, it is especially important here, since you will be working directly over the item to be cleaned.
 First, remove the liner from your crockpot. Then spray the interior with cleaner. Check the product’s directions to find out how long you should allow the foam to sit before cleaning up.For especially dirty cookers, wait a while longer for the dirt and grime to absorb even more foam.
 Use a sponge, dishcloth, or similar soft material to wipe up the cleaner.If needed, scrub to remove any stubborn bits that haven’t fully detached from the walls.If scrubbing still doesn’t work, apply a second coat and repeat.


Be sure you have removed all traces of cleaner before using the cooker again. After wiping up the foam and dirt with a sponge, use paper towels to go over the inside again. Dry it thoroughly.

 Getting a chance to physically create the abstract concepts of chemistry in a lab will help to build a stronger understanding.Some people will find they have an easier time grasping the lesson when they are doing it instead of reading about it.
 If you are taking a class, the labs are designed to support your current lessons and lectures. Pay close attention to pre-lab and post-lab assignments, as you will likely encounter the information on an exam.
 Chemistry is ultimately a science performed in a lab. Seize the opportunity to learn hands-on by experimentation. It will give you a chance to brush up on your knowledge of measurements and equations. It can even be fun.

 Laser hair-removal is a proven method to remove hair completely from your body, minimizing future hair growth. Although the process is effective, laser treatment requires a lot of patience and money.
 If you have decided to go for a laser treatment, go when you have a full hair growth. This will help the specialist to have a thorough idea about the thickness and properties of your hair which would help them to decide the radiation intensity to use.
 In order to completely clear your body, you need to have at least 6 sittings of laser hair removal. This is not only time-consuming, but painful. However, results can last a long time.

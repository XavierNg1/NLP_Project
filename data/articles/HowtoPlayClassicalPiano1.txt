 As a classical pianist you will rely heavily on your books filled with classical masterpieces from all manner of famous or lesser known composers. It is a general belief and unwritten rule that when you play a classical piece you want to stay true to its composer's intent, so it is very important that you don't rely on your ear to learn a classical piece, because it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to pick out every note played by a pianist performing the piece you aim to learn. Due to this, playing classical music and being able to read sheet music goes hand in hand.
 This is especially important for fast and technically challenging pieces that require dexterity, control and endurance. The easiest way to do this is to have a teacher than can give you professional tips and ideas to help you find a technique that works well for you.


Relax your shoulders and don't tense your forearms.
Use your arm weight. Rather than just pressing the keys using your fingers, relax your arms and use the joints in your fingers to keep your wrists straight. Remember that your forearms should not have tension in them while playing. The weight of your arms should be able to rest on your fingers.
Try having your hands rest on your knees or thighs while sitting down. This is the same relaxation you should feel playing the piano. Gravity is your friend.
Watch videos of acknowledged skilled pianists to get inspiration. Ask a teacher or friends with knowledge in the area for pianists with excellent technique.

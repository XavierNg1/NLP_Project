 You could use a non-bendy straw, but the bendy kinds top portion is just the right size. Don't have one of those? Cut off a portion of your straw that's about 2 inches (5 cm) in length.


Obviously, you want a white straw. Red stripes could be blood, but only the dimmest of bulbs will be fooled.
 Force it to fold in half, forming a crease, and then cut each end to a point. You can make it super pointy and long or you can make it more subtle. How steep of an angle do you want to go for?


Do this for both halves of the straw on both the top and bottom.
 They should be weakened enough that the two come apart with just a bit of tugging. You now have two fang-like caps for your teeth. Instead of leaving the front and back, cut off one fang on each, leaving a band to wrap around your teeth.


If you left both sides, you'd be able to see two different fangs on each tooth. This way, the fang will stay on with the band of straw that wraps behind and the fang will only stick out the front.
 Those are the teeth that already come to a point almost naturally. You could put them over other teeth if you really felt like it, but that might not get the vampire point across.


These aren't super sturdy. You'll be able to talk and drink (ideally with a straw), and if you eat, try to eat at the back of your mouth. The benefit of these, however, is that they're super easy to take out and put right back in!

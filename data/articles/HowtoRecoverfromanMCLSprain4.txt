 Sprain can be classified depending on the severity of damage to the ligament:


First Degree Sprain: Only a small number of ligament fibres are damaged.
Second Degree Sprain: Affects a greater portion of ligament fibres however the ligaments stay integral.
Third Degree Sprain: Causes total shatter of the ligament that can affect other structures in the knee like the meniscus (cartilage) and Anterior Cruciate Ligament.
 People who play contact sports where you collide with other players often suffer from this injury. However, this type of sprain can also be caused by any trauma that causes a disturbance to the ligaments.


Athletes who participate in contact sports, or sports where they must run and change direction quickly are at a greater risk of injuring their MCLs.
 The signs and symptoms of an MCL sprain may vary depending on the degree of injury:


First degree sprain: Localized sharp pain is felt on the site of injury due to the stress or irritation placed on the ligament. Sensation of pain may worsen upon movement of joints or after any contact made on the injured part.
Second degree sprain: You may feel pain if the injured area is touched, or any pressure is applied to it. Inflammation may be visible within 24 hours after injury. The pain is sharp and throbbing or pulsating.
Third degree sprain: Rupture of the ligament is present accompanied by unsteadiness of the knee joint. Any movement or activity involving the knee joint may be impaired as well. Swelling can be apparent due to the leakage of fluids from the damaged joint. The pain is sharp and excruciating.

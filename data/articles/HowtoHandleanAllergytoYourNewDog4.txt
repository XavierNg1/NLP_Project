 If you cannot handle owning your dog due to your allergy, you may decide to put it up for adoption. The adoption process can be lengthy and time consuming, especially as there are often more dogs up for adoption than available owners. You will need to contact your local Humane Society or SPCA for more information on giving up your dog for adoption.You will need to provide basic information about your dog, such as age, breed, gender, and given name. You may need to put your dog on a waiting list until a spot opens at a local shelter where the dog can stay while it awaits adoption.
You can contact dog shelters or rescue groups in your area directly to see if they will house your dog during the adoption process. Look for shelters that have a no kill policy, as some shelters will put down dogs who are not adopted by a set time.
 If you want to avoid the adoption process, you can try giving your dog to another pet owner. You may ask a pet owner in your neighborhood or friend group to take the dog. Or you may contact a pet owner at your doggy daycare or in your training group. Try to find an owner who knows your dog well already and seems open to owning more pets. Make sure your dog gets along with any pets that owner already has.


For example, you may say to the owner, "My allergy to my dog is severe and I can no longer keep him in my home. Would you be willing to take over ownership of him?"

, You can also reach out to family members or friends who seem interested in owning a pet. Contact a close family member who has space for a pet and seems to like your dog. Or reach out to a friend who seems open to owning a dog.


For example, you may ask a friend or family member, "My allergy has made it impossible for me to keep my dog. Would you be willing to take over ownership of my dog?"

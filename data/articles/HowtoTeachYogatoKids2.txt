 One way kids will get interested in yoga is by watching you.
 Relaxed and deep breathing is essential to the practice of yoga.


Explain that proper breathing produces calm, allows focus and increases energy. Kids often need to understand "why" they are asked to do something. Teaching the benefits of breathing correctly will help them learn it better.
 Before you even get into yoga poses, kids can learn a lot from the chants you might do while practicing yoga. These will have a soothing effect and help them concentrate.
 For example, pretend you are taking a trip through the jungle or you are on a deserted island as you introduce different poses.
 This game is an easy and fun way to teach kids poses. You can be the leader and the kids can be the followers.

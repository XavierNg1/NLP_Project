 Get out a loaf of your favorite bread or rustic white bread. Cut off 1/4 of the loaf to use for the breadcrumbs. Tear or cut the bread so you get 2 cups (70 g) of cubed bread.You can remove the crust from the bread for completely white breadcrumbs. Use fresh or stale bread for the breadcrumbs., Transfer the cubes of bread to a food processor. Pulse the bread just until you have coarse breadcrumbs. If you process the bread for too long, it will become gummy and clog the food processor blade., Pour 3 tablespoons (42 g) of olive oil into a skillet. Turn the heat on to medium-high and stir in the fresh breadcrumbs. Stir and cook the breadcrumbs for 5 minutes. They should become crisp and golden brown once they've finished toasting., Sprinkle kosher salt over the breadcrumbs according to your taste. Lay a paper towel on a plate and transfer the breadcrumbs to the paper towel to drain. Let the breadcrumbs cool completely before you use them.Store the toasted breadcrumbs in an airtight container at room temperature.

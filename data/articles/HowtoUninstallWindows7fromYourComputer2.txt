 When deleting Windows 7 from a multiboot environment, you'll need to make sure that your boot manager is copied and configured to boot from the remaining operating system. This is typically only necessary if Windows 7 was the first operating system installed on the computer.
 This is a boot manager configuration tool that will allow you to adjust your boot manager while deleting Windows 7. You can download the Non-commercial version for free from neosmart.net/EasyBCD/#comparison.
 You can also press the Windows key + R.
 This will open the Disk Management window.
 You can expand the Status column if you can't see enough. The volume with the "System" status is the volume that contains the boot manager. If your Windows 7 volume is the one marked "System", read on to the next step. If the volume for your other operating system is marked "System", skip down to Step 10

,,,,, Now that the boot manager has been copied, you can safely start the deletion process.
 You will be asked to confirm that you want to delete the volume.
, Select "Extend Volume" and add the newly created free space to it.
 You'll now need to reconfigure your boot manager so that it boots properly into your remaining operating system.
,,,,, Your system will now boot properly to your remaining operating system.Repeat this for any additional operating systems you still have installed.

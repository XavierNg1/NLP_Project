 Although it is important to keep your cat in a quiet, traffic-free area while they recover from an anesthesia, you should still check on them frequently. For example, you should enter the room with your cat every few hours to make sure that it is breathing normally and not experiencing too much discomfort., In some cases a cat may have a negative reaction to the anesthesia, causing them to experience respiratory distress. This includes laboured breathing. If your cat shows signs of laboured breathing, contact your vet immediately., Usually when cats receive anesthesia, it is accompanied by surgery and/or stitches. As a result, it is important to watch the incision site for any complications. Watch for redness, swelling, or any discharge from the incision, or for your cat biting or scratching around the area.Call your vet immediately if you notice any signs of irritation around the incision site.
You can also help avoid complications such as biting by using an Elizabethan collar, sometimes called a cone collar, available from your vet or pet supply stores. Be sure to properly fit the collar so that your cat cannot get around it.
 If you are at all concerned with your cat’s recovery from the anesthesia, then you should call your veterinarian. For example, if your cat’s energy levels do not begin to rise within a few days, this could be a sign of an underlying issue. It is always best to be on the safe side.

 This method originated in Hawaii, and is still commonly used there to crack into macadamias. The rock provides a hard surface to stabilize the nut. Look for a small hole that's deep enough to hold the nut in place, but shallow enough so that it sticks out over the hole a bit.


If you live near volcanic rock, you'll likely find some with holes just the right size.
If you don't live near volcanic rock, locate some limestone or shale with natural, small holes in it. Some people have found success using a crack in the sidewalk; be careful, though, since you could damage the sidewalk with this method.
 Carefully place it so that the seam is facing up and you'll have a clear shot when you pound the shell open.
 Any heavy, flat, hard rock should work. Grasp the rock tightly, lift it over your head, then smash it down on the seam of the macadamia nutshell. The shell should pop right open.


Let the rock bounce back toward you slightly after you pound it down. If you continue driving it into the shell you'll smash the nut inside.
If you have trouble breaking open the shell, experiment with different angles and rocks of different shapes and sizes.
 Take a look at the nut to make sure it doesn't have gravel or other rock particles attached to it. You may want to rinse it off before consuming.

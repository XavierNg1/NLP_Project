 It has to make sense. You may be set on Wishbreeze, but would a queen name her kit Wishkit? No, queens don't name their kits things like Hopekit, Wishkit, Ghostkit, or Dreamkit.


The queen will name the kit after it's fur color, first impression, or where they were born. They usually don't want to wait until the kit is a few days old, so they most likely won't be named after their eye color. Besides, cats are born with blue eyes, and the parents don't want to wait to name them after their eyes. Write down all of the prefixes that make sense for your cat.
For cats that used to be rogues, you can make their old rogue--or kittypet--names their prefix. Like if a rogue named Pine became a Clan cat, his name might be Pinetail.;
, All kits names end in -kit, apprentices' names end in -paw, the leader's name ends in -star, and a warrior's name can end in anything except those listed above and things that warrior cats wouldn't know. Elders, queens, and the deputy have names just like warriors.
 An all black cat with amber eyes wouldn't have a suffix of -frost. It just wouldn't make sense. Write down all of the suffixes that makes sense.
 Write down any possible names that sound good.


This is the main character; him/her and the main villain should have the most memorable names. Make it roll off the tongue, and be nice-sounding, but not unbelievably beautiful.
Names like Grayfur and Whitetail are very unmemorable. Smoketalon and Hailshine would be better names for a gray tom and white she-cat.

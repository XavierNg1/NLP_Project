 Approximately 1/10 people identify as LGBT+, so make 10 friends and there's a good chance you'll meet someone. Many young people are in the closet, so it might take a while before you find out which of your friends are gay.
 If you make one gay friend, they probably have one or two other LGBT+ friends, who in turn have even MORE friends who are gay. This is an excellent way to meet someone.

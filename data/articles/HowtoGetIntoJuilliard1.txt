 Be willing to listen to and learn from this teacher's assessment of both your strengths and weaknesses, so that you can enhance the strengths and improve the weaknesses without fear or favor.;
, Devote at least one hour daily if you're a musician and three hours daily if you're a dancer.
 If you're a musician, vary your repertoire as broadly as possible. If you're a dancer, try different styles of dancing, even if they are not ones you intend to specialize in. If you're looking towards drama, act in different roles. This way, you'll learn to appreciate your skill as a whole and become better at what you already love doing. Moreover, the wider your abilities and the more comfortable you are with different approaches, the more versatile and suitable a performer you're making yourself into.
 Attend competitions, master classes, and/or lectures if possible. Most of all, perform as often as possible! Performing in public is a key part of being fully engaged in the Arts. Furthermore, the more you perform the easier you'll overcome stage fright, and the easier your Juilliard audition will be. (However, realize that you may always have nerves, some of the greatest performers always do, and learn to channel this into performing even better.)

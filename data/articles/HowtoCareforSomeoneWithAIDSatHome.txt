 You are one caregiver who is part of a larger team that is working to keep the person healthy and happy. It’s important to talk to any medical professionals or other individuals who are also providing care for the person with AIDS. Doctors, nurses, social workers, case managers, can give you important information about the person’s health and care. They can also give you tips on how best to provide care for the person. Coordinating your care with other types of treatment the person is receiving can boost his or her health and wellbeing.Get the person’s permission to contact his or her healthcare team. You may need the permission in writing, but assure the person you are doing this in his or her best interests.
Ask any questions you have about caring for the person. This may be things such as knowing when and how much medication to give, when you should wear protective gloves, and ways to boost his or her health.
Keep the care team informed as you work with the person. You may notice things that he or she doesn’t and it could be vital information to a doctor in the person's overall care.;
, Most people with AIDS take medication to manage the disease. These can help prolong life and fight conditions associated with AIDS. Make sure the person is taking medications and has prescription refills on time. You should also watch for side effects any medication is having. This can help the person maintain his or her health for the long term.Read the dosing instructions for every medication the person is taking. Check to see if he or she has taken the medication for the day. You can also keep a notebook of medications and the times he or she takes it to ensure that the proper dose is taken.Talk to the person about any side effects he or she may be having. If it is acceptable to the person, contact his or her doctor to discuss the side effects and ways to relieve them, including taking a different medication.
 If you are giving or watching the person’s medication, it’s a good idea to learn about the person’s treatment. This can help ensure you are giving the person proper care and watch out for potential problems with medications or other treatments. Some of the most common medications and treatments for AIDS are:#*Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTI), which interrupt the virus from duplicating. NRTI drugs include: Abacavir (Ziagen, ABC), Didanosine (Videx, dideoxyinosine, ddI), Emtricitabine (Emtriva, FTC), Lamivudine (Epivir, 3TC), Stavudine (Zerit, d4T), Tenofovir (Viread, TDF), Zalcitabine (Hivid, ddC), Zidovudine (Retrovir, ZDV or AZT).


Protease Inhibitors (PI), which also interrupt virus replication, but at a later step in the virus life cycle. Some PI’s the person may take are: Amprenavir (Agenerase, APV), Atazanavir (Reyataz, ATV), Fosamprenavir (Lexiva, FOS), Indinavir (Crixivan, IDV), Lopinavir (Kaletra, LPV/r), Ritonavir (Norvir, RIT), Saquinavir (Fortovase, Invirase, SQV).
Fusion inhibitors, a new class of drugs that prevent HIV from fusing with the inside of a cell, which keeps it from replicating. This type of drugs includes Enfuvirtide (Fuzeon or T-20).
Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), which also known as the anti-HIV "cocktail." It is a combination of three or more drugs such as protease inhibitors and other anti-retroviral medications. HAART decreases the rate at which HIV replicates itself and can slow the spread of the virus in the body.
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are drugs that block the HIV from infecting new cells by. NNRTIs such as Delvaridine (Rescriptor, DLV), Efravirenz (Sustiva, EFV), and Nevirapine (Viramune, NVP) are prescribed in combination with other retroviral drugs.
 Someone with AIDS is vulnerable to other diseases and conditions because of his or her weakened immune system. The person with AIDS, you, and anyone else who has close contact should get regular immunizations to minimize the risk transmitting diseases like measles, polio, or tuberculosis to the individual for whom you are caring.Ask the doctor about the best immunizations for the person with AIDS. The medical professional may suggest immunizations for pneumonia and the flu.He or she may also give the person with AIDS the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.Be sure that you, family members, or anyone else who is in close contact to the person with AIDS have proper immunizations as well. This includes MMR, flu, and polio. It’s important that the polio vaccine be “inactivated virus” because the live culture has weakened polio virus that can give a person with AIDS polio. You and other close contacts should also be checked for tuberculosis (TB) every year.
 Because AIDS causes a weakened immune system, illnesses you might consider otherwise harmless can be deadly to the person with the disease. If you or anyone who has contact with the person is sick, stay away until healthy. This minimizes the risk of transmitting potentially harmful illnesses to the person.Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth if no one else can care for the person. You should also wash your hands with soap and water before you touch the individual.
Be aware that chickenpox and shingles can kill someone with AIDS. Never let a person with chickenpox or shingles in the same room as a person with AIDS until at least the sores have crusted over. Anyone who has been near someone with chickenpox or shingles also shouldn’t be in the same room. In this case, the person can visit again after 3 weeks.
 To protect yourself as well as the person with HIV / AIDS, cover any sores and cuts you have with bandages. If you have a rash or sores on your hands, wear disposable gloves when providing care. If you have cold sores, fever blisters or any other kind of skin infection, then avoid touching the person or their things.You should also, if at all possible, stay away from the person with HIV / AIDS if you have impetigo, boils, or shingles.
 Healthy foods can keep a person with AIDS strong, give him or her more energy, and support the immune system. Making sure the person has plenty of healthy choices stocked in the kitchen can maintain or even boost overall health.Consider cooking together for a fun and lighthearted activity. A person with AIDS can safely cook for others unless he or she has diarrhea.Involve the person in planning his or her meals. This will give you a sense or what he or she likes and can help you pick foods at the supermarket.Incorporate plenty of fruits and vegetables for fiber and vitamins, starchy carbs for energy, protein, and some dairy products. You should also include small amounts of fats and sugars. Some excellent examples of foods for a person with AIDS are: raspberries, blueberries, spinach, bread, potatoes, lean meat, eggs, yogurt, and cheese., A person with AIDS can eat almost any food he or she wants. But there are some foods that may cause foodborne illnesses that he or she should avoid. These foods include:Raw or unpasteurized milk
Raw eggs and foods with raw eggs such as hollandaise sauce
Uncooked or lightly cooked meats
Raw fish or shellfish

, Just as proper nutrition is important to a person with AIDS, so is getting activity or exercise. This can build muscles, keep the bones strong, and keep his or heart healthy. If the person is able, suggest doing an activity together or go to a gym or outside for some exercise.Exercise may help the person feel better and relieve the side effects of AIDS and medications.Keep in mind that everyday activities like dancing, walk to the park, playing with kids, and gardening are activities that can get the person moving.Aim for the person to get 45 minutes to an hour of activity 3-4 times a week. If the person isn’t able, help him or her do whatever is possible. This might be walking in the yard for a few minutes twice a day.Consider different types of exercise such as cardio, resistance training, or flexibility training. Things like running, swimming, lifting light weights, or doing yoga can promote overall physical and mental health., Rest is something else that is also important to a person with AIDS. It helps the body recover and relax from stress, which can be harmful to the immune system. Make sure the person is getting plenty of rest during the day if he or she is tired. Allow the person to sleep for eight hours every night., A person with AIDS may be down or stressed about things such as the rest of his or her life, fulfilling goals, and maintaining contact with others. These types of concerns can harm the person’s immune system. Making sure you are there to provide emotional support to the person can help him or her relax and feel confident to live an active life.Talk to the person often and make yourself available to discuss anything he or she wants. You don’t have to push, but can say something like, “I care about you very much, Alex, and I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything you want anytime.”

, In addition to your emotional support, the person for whom you’re caring may require emotional support from a medical professional or social worker. These people may have special training to support AIDS patients, including individuals who may be suffering from depression. This may help the person deal with fears or stresses related to the disease.Talk about counseling if you feel the person has a problem that is better solved by a professional. Broach the subject gently. You could say, “You know Sam, I am always here to support you and talk about your feelings. But there are some things that I don’t know a lot about and I wonder if maybe seeing a counselor who helps other AIDS patients could supplement my support.”
Make sure to let the person’s care team know about your concerns. Ask for possible references to counselors who may help. You can also locate a counselor or psychiatrist near you at services such as http://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/hiv-aids.html and http://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/issues/hiv-aids.
 Surround the person with people that he or she loves. You can also be sure to invite and include the person in group activities or outings. Knowing that he or she is a part of a caring community can help relax and de-stress the person.Find things the person likes to do and help him or her do them as much as possible. This could be something like bringing books and magazines, going for a relaxing walk together to enjoy nature. Ask if the person would like to take a warm bath or get a massage.
Ask the person if he or she would be interested in having a therapy dog stop by once a week or more. It may help relax or soothe the person. Just be sure that the dog is clean and the person is healthy enough to touch pets., Smoking, drugs and alcohol are harmful to the body, especially the liver and lungs. These can increase vulnerability to infection as well as rob the body of previous vitamins. If the person uses tobacco, drugs, or alcohol, suggest that he or she quit to help maintain health and wellbeing., You also need to know whom and when to call for help or information if you are caring for someone with AIDS. Make a list of doctors, nurses, and other people you might need to contact in case of emergency. Write down phone numbers and information such as when they are available. Keep the list by the phone for easy access.
 Companion animals can provide comfort and joy to a person with AIDS. But animals can also carry parasites that cause infections. Cleaning up after animals for the person can minimize the risk that he or she is infected with a parasite.Clean up any animal feces for the person, including the kitty litter box. Empty, don’t sift, the cat litter every day.Cat feces can cause toxoplasmosis, while reptiles can carry salmonella and birds may have the fungus cryptococcus or histoplasmosis.
Make sure that you and the person with AIDS wash your hands thoroughly after handling pets or cleaning up after animals., Just as coming in contact with animals and their feces can be harmful for a person with AIDS, so can being in the garden. A garden or potting soil often has germs. You and the person should wear work gloves when handling dirt. Washing your hands before and after handling dirt—even with gloves-- is also advisable., Germs can be dangerous for a person with AIDS. Having regular cleaning sessions can help maintain the person’s health and keep infections at bay.Clean and dust the entire home at least once every week and more often if necessary. Sanitize toilets, tubs, showers, and sinks more frequently and as needed.
Use either commercial cleaners or a bleach mixture of ¼ cup bleach to 1 gallon of water (or 1 tablespoon to 1 quart water for smaller jobs). Rinse surfaces with fresh water after disinfecting them.
 You can use many of the same items a person with AIDS does including utensils and bedding. The key is to wash them regularly or as needed. This can prevent the spread of diseases to the person with AIDS and also minimize your risk of coming into contact with HIV.Recognize that a person with AIDS doesn’t need separate utensils such as dishes, knives, forks, or spoons. His or her dishes also don’t need special cleaning. Washing this dishes in hot water with soap or dishwasher detergent is plenty to keep everyone safe and healthy.
Wash bedding or clothing in hot water at least once a week. If anything is soiled with blood, vomit, semen, vaginal fluids, urine or feces, remove them with disposable gloves. Wash immediately or as soon as you can. If you have to wait to wash the items, put them in plastic bags.
 A person with AIDS should have his or her own razors, toothbrushes, tweezers, nail or cuticle clippers, and pierced jewelry. Anything that may have the person’s blood on it shouldn’t be shared because it can transmit HIV. You can also transmit infections to someone with AIDS by sharing these types of personal items., Many people are scared of contracting HIV through something as simple as a hug. HIV and AIDS are transmitted by blood. Knowing the ways you cannot get AIDS can help you more confidently and sympathetically provide care to a person who has the disease at home. A well-timed hug can go a long way to helping the person feel better.HIV/ AIDS is not spread:


By food or water
By sharing food, dishes, or cooking utensils including cups, plates, forks and knives
By touching another person, hugging, shaking hands, or holding people

, Get a grasp on the basics of the disease as well as any new research or information about care. Learning about AIDS can help you provide better care for the person who has the disease.Consult the websites and/ or publications from government and international organizations, AIDS support groups, and research centers. You can even sign up to receive newsletters from many of these places, which may help you stay informed on the latest and best care for the person with AIDS.
 In some cases, such as medical care or life support decisions, you may need to be legally named as the care coordinator. This may also be important if you are going to file insurance claims, apply for government aid, pay bills, or handle other business for the person with AIDS. Meet with a lawyer or an AIDS support organization to see what options are available to you and the person for whom you are caring.Let the person for whom you are caring know about any concerns about providing sufficient care without legal acknowledgement. The person can decide how much or how little to involve you in important decisions. Tell him or her you will respect any wishes he or she has.
Contact local lawyers or health advocates about what options are open to both of you. Attend any meetings with the person, or, if he or she can’t go, give them a selection of options from which to choose.
Find AIDS support organizations in your local area using online search tools.Consult organizations, such as your local health and human services department. This can help the person with AIDS get whatever benefits to which he or she is entitled.
 If you are able and new to providing care, consider taking a course on home care for someone with AIDS. The class can help you learn the skills you need to provide care as well as how to effectively handle special situations.Inquire with your local public health department, Red Cross/ Red Crescent chapter, a visiting nurses association, or an HIV/AIDS service organization about home care courses.
Ask any questions you have about how to best care for the person during your course. You can never know too much or be prepared enough.
 Providing care for a person with AIDS can be physically and emotionally draining. You can't take care of someone else effectively if you are sick or upset. Taking good care of yourself through things like rest and exercise can help you keep going and give the best care possible to the person with AIDS.Watch your own health. Eat a balanced diet, exercise as often as you can, and give yourself sufficient time to rest, which can help you relax.
Consider joining a support group or talking to a counselor. Either of these can help you deal with your feelings about your role as caregiver. A support group or counselor can help bolster you and give you an outlet to tackle any hurdles you may encounter.
 Allow yourself to do things you enjoy, such as visiting friends or going out for a meal. Remember that you are not selfish for taking some time to yourself. Don’t avoid anything you want to do because you feel badly for the person or guilty for leaving. In the long run, living your own life may help both you and the person for whom you are caring.


Ask a family member or friend to care for the person if you need a break. Many AIDS service organizations can help with "respite care" and send someone to be with the person while you get out of the house for a while.

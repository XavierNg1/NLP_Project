 When experiencing an adrenaline rush, take note of your physical symptoms. Usually, an adrenaline rush will pass over on its own. However, be aware of your symptoms and take precautions when necessary.


You may notice an increase in strength. If you're at the gym, for example, you may suddenly be able to lift more weight. You may also feel less pain physically as adrenaline protects our bodies from pain. Be careful when experiencing these symptoms. Try to keep in mind this is an adrenaline rush and you should not overexert yourself. You will feel the pain when the rush passes.You may also notice a sudden boost of energy and rapid breathing. If these symptoms feel extreme, take measures to calm yourself down. Take long, deep breaths. Go somewhere and sit down. Take in the scene around you. This will help take your mind off whatever caused the adrenaline rush., Exposing yourself to extremely high levels of stress over long periods of time is not healthy.Even short-lived stress can cause physical symptoms like stomach cramps, heart palpitations, and an increase in blood pressure.Therefore, do not try to stimulate an adrenaline rush multiple times a day every day. It can be fun and healthy to occasionally push yourself out of your comfort zone but give yourself time to unwind afterwards. For example, watch a funny cartoon show after watching a scary movie.
 Minor risks and scares are a great way to stimulate an adrenaline rush. However, you should not engage in situations that could cause harm to yourself or others simply to get an adrenaline rush. Stick to situations that are safe and controlled.


If you routinely engage in risky behavior in hopes of stimulating adrenaline, talk to a psychiatrist or therapist. This can be a sign of an underlying mental health condition. Borderline personality disorder is especially associated with a tendency towards risky behaviors.

 Some neutral tone outfits look appropriate when matched with neutral tone shoes. For instance, a little black dress can look stunning with the right pair of black heels. If you plan on wearing the same color from head to toe, however, you should be prepared to accessorize with jewelry that adds a bit of color or sparkle to your outfit to avoid looking too drab.;
, Sometimes, too many neutral tones can make an outfit look dull. A bright shoe is a quick way to remedy the situation. Try a bright red pump with a white blouse and black pencil skirt, or a spring green pump with brown slacks and a beige top.
 If your clothes are already loud enough to do the talking, avoid shoes that will compete for attention. The next time you slip on a royal blue sundress, match it with a pair of white sandals instead of going for more blue.
 More accurately, go with a nude colored shoe. A nude shoe is a neutral because it blends into your skin tone. Because it mimics the tone of your skin, it is also relatively easy to pair with other neutrals and colors.
 If you like the monochromatic look, you can still pull it off as long as the shades vary from one another. Try wearing a rose-colored pump the next time you wear a light pink t-shirt and jeans, or a chocolate brown boot with a light brown sweater dress.
 If you have a top, bottom, or dress with a pattern on it, pick one color from the pattern and find shoes that match. For instance, if you have a skirt with a geometric pattern that includes navy, sky blue, and teal, try wearing it with a teal flat or a navy wedge heel.

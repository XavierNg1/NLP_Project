 For a professional finish and ease of production, buy a full button press. They aren't that much money and it will make the work a lot easier, if you need to make several hundred buttons.


You can also buy a hand-held cheap version but this produces a cheap-looking button.
You can also get paper cutters which will further streamline the process. Just make sure it's the right size for your machine.
 You'll need the disk, the back, and the clear plastic front. Make sure it is for a button machine and make sure it is for the same size button that your machine produces.
 Print and cut out the image that you want on your button. Make sure the image you have is the right size for the button casing and then print it out on regular paper. Cut out the images as perfectly as you can.
 Make sure the machine is in the starting position. Place the back piece in the circular nest, backside facing down and the line of the pin horizontal.
 The disk should be placed in next, bowl or underside-side down.
 The image should be facing up and aligned correctly with the pin.
 Place the plastic on top of the image.
 Press down on the lever until you hear a click.
 Switch the machine into the second position.
 Press down firmly. There may not be a click.
 Lift the lever again and your button should be complete. There may be a release switch to make it easier to remove the button from the nest.

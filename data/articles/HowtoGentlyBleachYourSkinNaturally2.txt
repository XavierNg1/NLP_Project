 An oatmeal mask is a great substitute for bleach on your skin. Oatmeal helps exfoliate the skin. This exfoliation gets rid of old skin cells. Getting rid of these old cells is the best way to encourage growth of new skin cells that will lighten and brighten your skin. To make your mask, you’ll need a teaspoon of oatmeal powder, a pinch of turmeric and a few drops of lemon juice.


Simply use a blender to blend oats for oatmeal powder. If you don’t have a blender, use a tablespoon of raw oats instead.
 Mix your oatmeal powder (or oatmeal), turmeric powder, and lemon juice in a small bowl. If you plan on putting it on more than just your face, evenly multiply the measurements as necessary. Mix it into a thick paste.
 Apply the paste evenly over your face. Let it dry. This will take up to 15 minutes so make sure you give yourself enough time.
 Once your mask has dried, use warm water to wash it off. While you’re washing it off, scrub it over your face. The dried oatmeal will exfoliate your skin.
 This scrub is very effective but takes time to work because it is much less harsh than bleach. It will take patience to reach your desired goal, but continue using this mask daily and you’ll see a noticeable difference.

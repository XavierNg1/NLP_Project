 Turn the grip slightly to the right (left handed golfers should turn grip slightly to the left). Do not grab the club more tightly. Hold it only tight enough to maintain control over the golf club during the swing. Any wrist or arm tension indicates that the grip is too tight.;
, Pull the golf club farther back before swinging. This will increase the speed of the swing. Bring the club straight back and follow through on the swing.
 When placing the ball on the tee, make sure the writing on the ball faces the direction that the ball should travel. This will help keep the head down and on the ball when swinging.
 Stand straight with the shoulders relaxed, and bend the knees slightly. Feet should be shoulder width apart, and facing forward, and the head should be down with the eyes focused on the ball. The stance should feel natural.
 Line the ball up with the front foot, and tip the club face in towards the body just a little bit.
 Stand away from the ball, and concentrate on the grip and the stance. Pay attention to the swing and practice it a few times before trying to hit the ball.
 Bring the golf club straight back and follow through on the swing. Keep head down and follow the ball onto the fairway.

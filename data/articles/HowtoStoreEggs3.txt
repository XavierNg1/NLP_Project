 The easiest way to tell when a package of eggs has gone bad is to take a whiff. After awhile, expired eggs will begin to emit an unpleasant sulfur stench. This odor is unignorable, so if you don’t detect anything offputting, there’s a good chance your eggs are okay.Fresh eggs should have no real smell of any kind.
Dispose of rotten eggs down the garbage disposal rather than the trash to keep the stench from spreading throughout your home.
 Once you crack the egg, take note of the condition of the white and yolk. Young egg whites should have a somewhat milky appearance due to their high natural protein content. As the egg ages and begins to break down, the white will become perfectly clear, and may turn thin and soupy.Clear whites don’t necessarily mean that an egg is bad, but they can be an indicator of freshness.
Avoid cooking with eggs that contain watery whites, as these have a more difficult time binding ingredients together.
 A healthy egg yolk will be firm and intact, with a rich golden-yellow color. By contrast, bad eggs will almost always contain flat, asymmetrical or easily-ruptured yolks. Dull-looking yolks are a clear sign that the egg is past its prime.Fresh eggs from pastured chickens often have large yolks that are a darker orange color and take up more of the area inside the egg., One time-honored method of testing the quality of questionable eggs is to submerge them in a few inches of water. If the egg is fresh, it will sink straight to the bottom of the bowl. If it bobs to the surface or hovers near the waterline, you may be better off acquiring another batch. When the shells of older eggs deteriorate, it creates a buildup of gasses inside, which will cause them to float.The float test will allow you to find out whether your eggs are still good without having to crack them.

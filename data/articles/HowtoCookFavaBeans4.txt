 Prepare a large baking sheet or shallow baking dish by coating it with nonstick cooking spray.

To reduce the amount of oil used in this recipe, line the baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil instead of coating it with cooking spray.
 Snap the end of each bean pod and peel the string down the entire length of the pod. Twist the string at the end of each pod to remove it.

For this cooking method, you actually need to keep the beans in their pods. Do not pry open the pod after removing the string and do not try to pluck out the individual beans.
 Fill a large mixing bowl with cool, fresh water and submerge the beans. Use your fingers to gently scrub away any dirt and debris.

When the water becomes notably dirty, dump it and add more fresh water to the bowl. Do this once or twice, or until the soaking water remains clear.
After cleaning them, dry the bean pods with clean paper towels.
 Arrange the fava bean pods on your prepared baking sheet in a single layer.

Try to arrange the pods so that the split sides face upward. Doing so is not absolutely crucial, but it will help make it easier for the salt and oil to seep inside and flavor the individual beans.
 Sprinkle the pods with salt, then drizzle them with oil.

Gently rock or shake the pan afterward to coat the bean pods more evenly.
 Place the beans in your preheated oven and cook them until the pods become soft and lightly browned. This will usually take 25 to 30 minutes.Use a serving spatula to stir the beans halfway through the roasting process. Doing so promotes more even cooking.
 Remove the roasted beans from the oven and sprinkle with black pepper. Enjoy the beans immediately or wait until they cool to room temperature.

Note that small roasted bean pods can actually be eaten whole.
Large fava bean pods will have a stringy texture, though, so you should pop the beans out of the shell using your fingers. Eat only the individual beans and not the bean pod.

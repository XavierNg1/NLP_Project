 If you want to keep your relationship status secret for now, don’t change your status on social media. To the world of social media, you can pretend you are single so people won’t know things have changed.You should also avoid mentioning the person, talking to them too much, or posting on their account.
 Though you may be taking a lot of pictures with your new significant other, you shouldn’t post pictures with the person. Updating Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat with photos of you and your new partner on a date or cuddling will alert others to your new relationship.


You shouldn’t post pictures of yourself with any obvious markers that you are with the other person. For example, don’t post pictures in the person’s house, wearing their clothes, or riding in their cars.
 Many people change their lock screen and phone background to a picture of their partner or of them and their partner. If you are trying to keep your relationship secret, avoid doing this. A picture of your secret partner is an obvious sign you are together.


Consider keeping any photos of you and your significant other on a secret flash drive or in a password protected folder. This way, no one will accidentally catch a glimpse of your partner if you open your camera or gallery.

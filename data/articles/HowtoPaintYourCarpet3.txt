 Hold the spray paint can at least one to two inches (2.5-5cm) away from the carpet for consistent coverage without over-painting.


Avoid shaking the can over the area you want to paint to prevent the paint from splashing or splattering.






Run the paint over the carpet in a smooth, even fashion. If the first pass is too light, repeat the step until you're satisfied with the coverage.






Dab any puddled paint on painter’s tape with a rag. You don’t want to have puddled tape dry on the tape as when you peel it away it could not only stick to the carpet, some paint could not be fully dry and spill on other areas of the carpet.
 Make sure you are fully satisfied with the section you are painting before moving forward.
 This may take some time, but doing it the right way will be worth the wait.


Be sure you lay painter's tape on fully dried paint. During the second or third phase of the painting, you may be laying painter’s tape on previously painted area. Never place tape on a painted area unless completely dry or you risk compromising the integrity of the previously painted area.
 Typical dry time is anywhere from eight to 10 hours depending upon the climate and humidity levels.

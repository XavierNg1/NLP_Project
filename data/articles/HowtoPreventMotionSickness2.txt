You can bring it with you if you are traveling by car or by boat. If you are traveling by plane, you may need to bring freshly sliced ginger and then ask for a cup of hot water on the plane. Airports generally do not permit you to carry liquids on board.
Ginger soda. You can bring ginger soda or ginger ale with you on a boat or in the car. If you are traveling by plane, check to see if you can purchase it in the airport cafes where drinks are often sold after people have gone through security.

Ginger supplements. Contact your doctor or the manufacturerâ€™s instructions to determine the dosage that would be right for you.

, If you have severe motion sickness and are planning a cross country car trip, a transoceanic boat trip, or several days of air travel, you may need medicine to manage your motion sickness. As with all medications, tell your doctor if you are pregnant, nursing, or on other medications. Your doctor may prescribe a scopolamine or hyoscine adhesive patch (Transderm Scop). This treatment may not be possible for people with asthma, glaucoma, urine retention, epilepsy, heart, kidney, or liver problems.
However, scopolamine has no effect on people under the age of 12.

The patch is generally worn behind the ear. It is usually effective for about 72 hours. Side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, and blurred vision.

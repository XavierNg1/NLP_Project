 You will arrive at the hospital and check-in with a nurse. Soon (unless you have requested a general anesthetic), you will be given a local anesthetic and begin to go numb. Depending on the type of cataract surgery you are having, the surgeon will then work for up to one hour. You will be aware that something is happening, but you should not experience any pain. After the surgeon is finished, you will be given some time to rest, before being released., This procedure usually takes only about an hour, so you will be able to go home the same day. However, you will not be able to drive. Be sure to arrange a ride home from the hospital., If you have cataracts in both eyes, you will need to return at a later date (usually a few months later) to have the procedure done on the other eye. This is done so that you can maintain proper vision in one of your eyes as you recover.
 After your procedure, expect your vision to start improving after just a few days. You should plan to see your doctor a day or two after the surgery, then again the following week, and once again after a month or so. Most discomfort should be gone after a few days, but it will take around eight weeks for your eye to heal.Contact your doctor right away if you experience:


Vision loss
Persistent pain
Severe eye redness
Light flashes or new floaters in front of your eye

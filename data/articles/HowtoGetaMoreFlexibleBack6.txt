 Push your pelvis down. If you feel pressure or pain, try not to push too hard.
 Sit back onto your bended knee and stretch out your front leg. Try to put your forehead to your knee. You should feel a stretch in your hamstring.
 Go down and far as you can but push a little further. Hold this position for 30 seconds.
 Just repeat steps 1, 2, and 3, three times a day (in the morning when you wake up, at noon, and before you go to bed). You shall soon achieve your splits, with practice.

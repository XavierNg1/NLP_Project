 You can use olive oil, mineral oil, petroleum jelly, butter, or mayonnaise to suffocate the bugs. Have enough on hand to cover the person’s entire scalp. For example, four tablespoons of petroleum jelly would be enough.
 After collecting your product, choose the room in which you would like to do the treatment. Aim for a space without carpeting that you can clean thoroughly afterwards. A kitchen or bathroom or anywhere outside would be appropriate. Gather gloves, clean towels, a bucket of hot water, and a shower cap. Have the person sit on a stool with a height at which you can easily work with their hair.
 Put disposable gloves on your hands. Have the person cover eyes with a towel when applying any treatment.You do not want to get oils accidentally in her eyes.


For younger children, the overnight shower cap treatment is not recommended. The cap could cause the child to suffocate. Instead, have the child wear the cap during the day.
 Ensure that the product covers the person’s entire head, as close to the scalp as possible, and all their hair. Put a shower cap on the person’s hair. Make sure it is not loose — it should be as tight as comfortably possible. Keep the cap on their hair for at least eight hours.
 Wash the person’s hair with shampoo. This should clean the smothering agent from the hair. For greasy substances like petroleum jelly, using kitchen soap can be effective. Comb the hair with your lice comb. Remove dead bugs and eggs. See Kill Head Lice Naturally for tips on using the lice comb. Wash hair once more.

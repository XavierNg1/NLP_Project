 Get a Bomb-omb. Wait till your enemy walks right by the crates. Then throw your Bomb-omb missile, grenade or fireball at the crates. Boom!;
, Make an area where there is a main floor. Put a block or two just over the edge one or two things higher than the main floor. Damage your enemy good. Get them close to the edge. Smash them up into the blocks! They can't get saved if it works right. You should see an angled trail of smoke hit the bottom of the blocks, then go towards the depths quickly.
 On the Ice Climbers stage, wait until the iceberg is stopped in the water. Get an enemy to the bottom floor. Hit them out to the water. A big fish will eat them.

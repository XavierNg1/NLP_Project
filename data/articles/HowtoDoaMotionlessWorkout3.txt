 Make sure your feet are on the mat and hold them in a straight, flexed position. Raise your chest up so that your forearm is placed on the mat directly below your shoulder.
 Flex your body and raise yourself onto the sides of your feet. Create a straight "plank" that rises from your feet through your hips and up to your shoulders.


Make sure you are not resting your body into your shoulder socket. Try to raise your upper body up from your arm, where it is planted on the mat.
 Breathe steadily as you hold it. This exercise is usually slightly harder than the regular plank exercise because it works side muscles, such as these obliques.
 Repeat 2 to 3 times, and then switch and repeat on the left side of the body.


Increase the time you spend in side plank position in increments of 5 to 10 seconds. Aim to hold the position on each side for 1 minute, doing 2 to 3 repetitions. If 1 side is noticeably weaker than the other side, do more repetitions on the weaker side, until they become equal.

,, Villagers don't have hair (you know that).
 You need to select what the "surprised eyes" and a green color. Then shrink it down.
 One of the main thing that makes a villager is it's very large "tube" nose.
 Keep the eyebrows it gives you, then make them a bit larger. Then push them closer together to make the unibrow.
, Then change the color of the shirt to brown. There you have it! A villager.

 Turn the oven on to 425 degrees F (220 C). Get out a rimmed baking sheet and tear off a sheet of aluminum foil. Lay the foil on the pan and set it aside while you finish preparing the ham vegetables.If you don't want to use foil, you could spray the sheet with a little cooking spray instead.
 Wash 1 large zucchini and peel 1 red onion. Chop both into large pieces. Keep in mind that the vegetables will shrink a little as they roast. They should also be cut into equal-sized pieces, so they all roast evenly. Put the vegetables and 2 cups ( 464 g) of frozen butternut squash cubes into a large mixing bowl.If you're not using frozen, cut butternut squash, you'll need to peel and cube about half of a medium-sized butternut squash.
 Cube 1 pound (453 g) of uncured cooked ham and place it in the bowl with the vegetables. Add the rest of the seasonings to the bowl. Stir the mixture well, so the vegetables and ham are evenly coated. You'll need to mix in:3 tablespoons canola oil
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
Black pepper to taste

, Transfer the seasoned ham and vegetables to the prepared baking sheet. Put the sheet in the oven and roast the mixture for 30 to 45 minutes. The vegetables should become completely tender. Serve the ham vegetables right away.You can store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Keep in mind that the vegetables will become even softer the longer they are stored.

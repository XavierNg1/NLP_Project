 Body language can reveal a student’s intention or thoughts of being aggressive or using force. Some of this body language is more subtle, requiring keen observation, whereas other body language is fairly overt and obvious, and clearly shows an intention to cause harm., The angrier someone is, the more likely they are to touch their head or rest their hands on their head. It’s as if the brain is full of discomfort that must be touched. The student may rub their scalp or clench their fists and remove them from the head area.These are all non-verbal cues that the student is becoming increasingly angry and potentially violent.
Also, if you see a student’s hands linger or hover near their waistband or inside their clothing, you should assume that they may have a weapon and take appropriate precautions., If a student removes outer layers of clothing, like a jacket or sweater, it could indicate that they are too warm. However, if you are looking at the student’s body language and can tell they are angry or frustrated and also see them removing clothes, you are seeing a non-verbal expression of escalating frustration and potential aggression.Students are especially prone to removing clothes and jewelry just prior to physically fighting.
 There are two types of stares that may reveal aggressive behavior or ideas: the thousand-yard stare and the target stare. Both of these indicate that the student is mentally elsewhere, and, when combined with other non-verbal cues, could indicate potential danger for you and your students.


The thousand-yard stare is one in which the person is unfocused, not seeing anything directly in front of them. It’s as if they’re looking through everything and everyone.The target stare is one in which the student narrows their eyes and stares directly at you or another student, often in the chin area.

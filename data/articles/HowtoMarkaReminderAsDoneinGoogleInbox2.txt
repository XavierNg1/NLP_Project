 You can find pinned reminders in your inbox, or you can open the Google Inbox menu (â˜°) and select "Reminders".


Reminders that you have previously marked as Done can also be found in the Reminders section.
 You can also click the button at the top of an open reminder. This will remove the reminder from your inbox.

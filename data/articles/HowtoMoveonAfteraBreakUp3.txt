 You may have let some relationships fall to the side while you were in love, but those friends have not forgotten you. Go out and have fun with people you like.
 Learning something new is a great way to take the sting out of a break up. Take cooking classes, learn a new language, start exploring photography or plant a garden.
 People are ready at different times. Some are ready to jump back into the dating pool and others are hesitant.


Let everyone know you are ready to date again. This will inspire introductions, blind dates and other potential set-ups. You can also think about online dating.
Make new friends if you are not comfortable dating just yet. Friendships can develop into something more romantic down the road.

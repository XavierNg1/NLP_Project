 Oily lids are one of the main reasons why eyeliner can smudge. Before you apply your eyeliner, make sure your lids are not oily. Take an oil-free makeup remover, apply several drops to a cotton ball, and pat the cotton ball on your eyelid. This should remove the excess oil from your lids. , Makeup primers are formulated to prep your face for makeup so that the makeup goes on more smoothly and lasts longer. Eyelid primer is made especially to prime your eyelids for liner and shadow. It combats oily eyelids and other factors that cause your eyeliner to shift. To apply primer, dab one drop on your finger and pat it into the eyelid. You can find eyelid primer at makeup stores like Sephora or Ulta. You can also find it at the drugstore but you many have to hunt for it, because not all brands at the drugstore sell it.
Do not use too much primer. Focus on making the primer go on in one thin layer.
If you have sensitive eyes, do not use primer on your waterline. Your waterline is the line of eyelid between your eyes and your lashes. Your waterline is very sensitive and primer may irritate your eyes.
 You want to make sure that your eyelid primer is dry before you apply eyeliner. If you apply eyeliner while the primer is still wet, you run the risk of the eyeliner smudging because it is being applied to a slippery surface. , To make sure that the primer sets, dust your eyelid with a translucent or nude-colored powder. Do not use too much powder, as this will cause your makeup to crease. Instead, cover your lids with a thin layer of powder to allow the primer to set.

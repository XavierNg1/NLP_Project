 Dry brushing is an ancient exfoliation technique that has gained popularity in recent years. Buy a facial brush with soft bristles made from natural fibers. Make sure the brush you use is made specifically to be used on the face, since body brushes are too harsh on fragile facial skin. Use the following technique to exfoliate your face:


Start with a clean face. Use makeup remover, rinse your face, and pat it dry with a towel. Make sure your face and the brush are both completely dry before you brush. This method won't work if your face is wet with water or soap.
Gently brush your face by moving the brush in small circles. Concentrate on the areas where your skin is the driest.
Be careful with the skin above and below your eyes, since the skin in these areas is thin and fragile.
When you're finished, rinse your face with cool water and apply moisturizer.
 Gels, creams, cleansers and scrubs containing tiny particles that exfoliate your face are sold at drugstores and beauty stores. You can also make your own with sugar, honey and green tea using the following recipe:


Brew a mug of green tea and place a few teaspoons in a bowl.
When the tea has cooled, mix in a tablespoon of sugar and a tablespoon of honey.
Apply the scrub to a clean face. Rub it in gently to exfoliate, concentrating on the driest areas.
Rinse your skin with cool water and apply moisturizer.

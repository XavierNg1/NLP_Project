 This serrated metal wheel, also called the striker, is the part of the lighter that creates a spark. When you roll the wheel down into the lighter chamber, it strikes against a piece of flint. The resultant spark ignites the gas from the fuel well, creating a small, steady flame.
 The red ignition button, when pressed, releases the gas valve to the fuel tank. In order to light the lighter, you'll need to strike the sparkwheel and hold the ignition button at the exact same time.
 When you spin the wheel, you make a spark. When you hold the button, you release a steady stream of gas. When you do to the two at the same time, the spark ignites the gas and sends a small flame through the hole at the top of the lighter. The flame will keep burning for as long as you hold the button.

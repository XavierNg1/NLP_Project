 The right shampoo can make a big difference in your war against oily hair. Pick one that is specifically designed for oily hair to help dry your hair and scalp out so it won't be so oily.


Oily scalp is a common problem with oily hair. To help with your scalp, look for a shampoo that has sodium lauryl sulfate, ammonium, or other detergents. These ingredients can help dry out your scalp.
Another category of detergents that can be helpful is sulfosuccinates., If you still want to use a condition, make sure it doesn't contain oils. Look for one that says that it's meant for oily hair. The label should say so on the front of the product.Better still, don't use one at all.
 Dry shampoos can help remove excess oil without showering. You can use them to give your hair an afternoon lift, or you can help stretch out the time between showering.You can find dry shampoos at your local drug store or hair salon.
Simply spray the shampoo in, and use your fingers to massage it in. You can brush it out if it helps.

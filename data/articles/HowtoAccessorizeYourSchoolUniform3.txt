 Choose a headband that lies flat against the head for the most wearable look. You can use a headband to pick up a color you like in your uniform or even add a little sparkle to your look. Experiment with prints and different widths to find a headband that you like.A headband can be particularly interesting if you have short hair, like a pixie cut.
Try wearing a headband with your hair up or down to see which look you like best.
 Play with scarves in different materials and prints to add interest to your school uniform. You can style them in a Parisian way tied around your neck, around the handle of a bag to add some color, or around your hair like a headband. Silk, cotton and linen are all versatile materials to consider.If you like an edgy, modern look when you’re not at school, you could choose a geometric scarf in a bright print.
If you a like a softer look, try a floral scarf in pastel colors.
 Use a hair clip instead of a plain hair band to dress up your uniform and express yourself. You could choose a clip with a motif you like or a clip covered in printed fabric for some color.If you’re dreaming of the beach, you could choose a pearlescent clip in the shape of a seashell.
If you love dogs, try a clip with a paw-and-bone print.
You can use the clip to secure your hair in a ponytail or try using one to clip your bangs out of your face.
 Any hat indoors is a bold choice, so opt for a sophisticated hat to elevate your uniform. Avoid extravagant or large hats, such as a sombrero, which will seem like a costume. For a feminine look, you could try a small fascinator in black or navy, or if you like a throwback, don a fedora in a color that matches your uniform.If allowed, you could try a more casual style, such as a baseball cap, in a more sophisticated fabric, such as a gray flannel.

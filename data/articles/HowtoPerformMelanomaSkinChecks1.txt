 The first step to doing a melanoma skin check is to undress completely. Make sure you are in a well-lit area. Stand in front of a full-length mirror.Have a hand-mirror nearby to help you check your back and other difficult to see areas.
You may want to ask a spouse, family member, or friend help you check those hard-to-see areas, as well as to check your neck and scalp.;
, Face the mirror and check everything you can see. Check your face, ears, neck, chest, and belly. Remember to note all your moles and note any abnormalities.Women should lift their breasts to check the skin underneath.
 After checking your upper body, move on to your arms. Check your underarms, both sides of both arms, the tops and the palms of your hands, between your fingers, and your fingernails., Sit down somewhere comfortable. Check the fronts of your thighs, shins, tops of your feet, in between your toes, and your toenails.Using the hand mirror, check the bottoms of each foot, each calf, and the backs of each of your thighs.
 To check your hard-to-reach areas, you can either stand or sit, whichever is more comfortable. Use the hand mirror to check your buttocks, genital area, lower and upper back, and the back of the neck and ears.It may be easier to look at your back in the full-length mirror by using a hand mirror â€” or asking your spouse, friend or family member to check.
 You should also check your scalp for melanomas. Use a comb to part your hair and check your scalp. At this time, a spouse, friend, or family member may be needed to check the back of your head and neck.
 If you are in one of the groups at risk, you need to check yourself regularly. You can do this once a month to keep track of your moles and notice any developing irregularities.For those who are not at high risk, you can check yourself every three, six, or even 12 months, depending on other risk factors like exposure to the sun or amount of moles.

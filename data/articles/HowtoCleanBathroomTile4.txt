 Cleaning corner tiles with a regular sponge or brush can be difficult. Instead, soak a cotton ball in the tile cleaner of your choice and press it into the corner you wish to clean. Wait several minutes then remove the cotton ball. Wipe the corner with a damp rag to remove any excess grime.Alternately, you could use an old toothbrush to scrub the corner area clean.
 Once annually, apply a coat of car wax after cleaning bathroom tile. This will cause water to roll off and prevent the growth of mildew. Plus, it gives your bathroom tile a nice shine.While the exact technique for applying the car wax varies with the specific wax you’ve chosen to utilize, you can generally dab a clean cloth in the tub of wax, then rub it in a thin layer across the bathroom tiles after cleaning.
After applying the wax to bathroom floor tile, buff it down to prevent the bathroom tile from being too slippery.
 If you’re cleaning the whole bathroom as opposed to just the bathroom tile, you should clean the floor tile last. This will prevent you from wiping dust and debris from shelves and countertops onto the floor after you’ve just cleaned it, thereby soiling the bathroom tile you just worked so hard to get clean.

 People are attracted to those who are interested in them. One way to convey interest is to listen. Allow the other person to talk and share their insight. Give cues, such as nodding and maintaining eye contact, to show you are paying attention.You can also do things like ask follow up questions. For example, "You grew up in New York City? That's interesting. What was it like?"

, People will fee more attracted to you if you make them feel attractive. Try to do flirtatious things, like smiling, making eye contact, and light touch. For example, brush the person's arm during conversation., Eye contact can convey interest and attraction. Holding the person's gaze throughout a conversation can make them more attracted to you.If you like someone, make more eye contact than you normally would. Aim to make eye contact for about 75% of the conversation.
Remember to look away on occasion, however, as too much eye contact can come off as too intense. Try to glance away about every 30 to 40 seconds for example.
 Body language can convey attraction and interest, which can make the other person attracted to you in turn. If you are attracted to someone, keep your body language open during interactions.Be aware of your torso. Keep your chest and abdomen open. Avoid doing things like crossing your arms or clutching something close to your chest.
Keep your hands visible. People are sometimes distrustful of people who conceal their hands, so keep your hands where the person can see them.
 Physical attraction does matter to a degree. You can make sure to brush your hair each day and wear flattering clothing, for example. If you wear makeup, try to put on a little makeup before you see the person to get their attention.


You can also try taking up a workout routine to build up some muscle. This can make you more attractive to others.

 Mixing paint colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel essentially cancels out the color properties of each and yields a dark hue. You can choose any red or green depending on how you want the black to look. Phthalo Green and Naphthol Red are great complements to combine for a simple black.
 Place a dab of blue paint, such as Cobalt Blue, and a dab of orange paint, such as Translucent Orange, onto your palette. Gently swirl the colors together until a vibrant black is formed. If equal parts of each doesnâ€™t create a dark enough black, add a bit more blue to the mixture.
 Create a mixture that is around 60% purple and around 40% yellow, and adjust this ratio to get the black that you want. Cadmium Yellow is standard paint that works well and you can mix it with a violet.

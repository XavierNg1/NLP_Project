 Each presentation for each class is going to be a bit different. Some instructors will be happy with 3 minutes while others will demand you stand there awkwardly for 7. Have all the guidelines clear when you go to write your presentation.


Know how long the speech must be.
Know how many points you're required to cover.
Know if you must include sources or visuals.;
, If you're giving a presentation to your classmates, you probably have a rough idea of their knowledge on the topic. But for virtually every other circumstance, you may be in the dark. Either way, cater your paper to make zero assumptions.


If you're presenting to people you know, it'll be easy to know what to break down and what to gloss over. But if you're presenting to unknown stockholders or faculty, for instance, you need to know about them and their knowledge levels, too. You may have to break your paper down into its most basic concepts. Find out what you can about their backgrounds.
 If you are giving a presentation in a facility you've never visited before, it's best to inquire about what you'll have at your disposal and what you'll need to set up beforehand.


Does the facility have a computer and projector screen?
Is there a working WiFi connection?
Is there a microphone? A podium?
Is there someone who can assist you in working the equipment before your presentation?

 Sterilize your containers in the dishwasher or sterilizer.
 You can also use frozen food if you'd like, which can be fresher if the fruit/vegetable is out of season. Look at the ingredients of frozen portions carefully to avoid any additives like sugar or salt.
 Peel the fruit. Steam the veggies or cook them in the microwave in a bit of water. Follow the directions and make sure the food is soft. It is not necessary to cook the fruit.
 Add warm water if necessary until you get a smooth consistency.

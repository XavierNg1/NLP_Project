 This expansion pack adds lots of new features including clubs.;
, At the start screen, you can:


Press the play button to load the last world you played
At the top of the screen, click the plus sign to create a new world
At the top of the screen, click the button to the left of the plus sign to bring up a list of worlds

, This should bring up the clubs menu.
 This will open a list of clubs. If you like one of the clubs on the list, click the button next to it saying "Join Club". If not, move on to the next step.
 You will now be able to customize your own club.
 The name can be anything, but it's best if it fits the club theme. You also should fill in the box below it with a short description of the club.
 This should be mostly self-explanatory, but here's a list of things you can customize:


Club Icon
Requirements
Activities
Hangout Location
Banned Activities

, You can add any sim in the current world, but choose sims that you would like to interact with because your sim will be spending a lot of time with them.
 Enjoy your new club!

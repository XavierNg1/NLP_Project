 It's one thing if you perceive your boss to have an unfair favourite in the company, but it can be an equally difficult situation to deal with if you find yourself being treated as the favourite. Becoming too close with your boss can lead to numerous problems and it is important to maintain your professionalism at all times. Avoid becoming too familiar and remember that she is your boss first and foremost., Being the favourite can provoke negative feelings from your colleagues, and can strain relationships. Combat this by making every effort to involve your colleagues and praise them to your boss. Doing this will gently encourage her to show appreciation to more people in your team than just you. By doing this you are showing your colleagues that you are still part of the team, while also demonstrating humility and appreciation of the work of others.Making a point of highlighting the skills and potentials of colleagues can also be a good way to help develop a better functioning work environment.
You're helping your boss manage the workload, but also helping your colleagues have the opportunity to prove themselves., If you are the favourite it's important you do not in any way take advantage of, or abuse, this situation. In fact, you should be wary of potentially undeserved benefits. If you're given a big office ahead of more senior colleagues don't be afraid to mention to your boss that you're not sure if you have earned it. Casually saying "what did I do to deserve this?" can encourage your boss to re-evaluate her approach.Clear signs of favouritism and undue benefits are likely to prompt suspicion and even gossip amongst your colleagues.

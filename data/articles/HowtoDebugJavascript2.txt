 Ask yourself:


Do I only need to know if a certain part of the program is running?
Do I only want to know one value, and timing is not important?

, To the screen. This could be any value.



Once this point is reached, it will create a popup on your screen with whatever information put into the argument of alert();

,


Is alert(); printing what I expect it to?
Is alert(); printing at all?

, You may have to restart your program to trigger the alert(); again.

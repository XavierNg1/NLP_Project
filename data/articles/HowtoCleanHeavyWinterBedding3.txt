 Washing the bedding yourself is a long process requiring several hours. It’s slow going, but fortunately, most of the time it takes is spent just waiting for the thing to dry. Just remember, when it comes to your heavy winter bedding, no price is too high., Most heavy winter bedding is sensitive to being washed, and should be washed only infrequently. In order to extend the life of your heavy winter bedding (and save yourself a good deal of time), invest in a washable cover for your duvet, comforter, or eiderdown. This is an especially good investment for pieces that can only be dry cleaned, since the dry cleaning process can be expensive.With a washable cover protecting your heavy winter bedding, you’ll need only strip the item of its cover and follow the care directions for the cover. Most covers are safe for use in home washing machines and dryers.
 Place your bedding in a cotton bedding bag. These bags are specially designed to keep bedding free of dust and humidity. Place the bags somewhere safe and enclosed like an armoire or large dresser.You can place more than one blanket or bedding item in each bag, but don’t overstuff the bags.
Ensure your bedding is thoroughly dried before storing it. If moisture remains in the bedding, you’ll end up with mold and mildew.

 If you notice your foundation turns an unpleasant shade of orange whenever you use it, you may want to try going one to two shades lighter than your normal shade. Sometimes, using a lighter shade can make your foundation appear less dark and make any oxidation less noticeable on your skin. The lighter shade will help to counteract the appearance of an orange tinge on your skin, even if oxidation does occur.You may try using a foundation that is one shade lighter than your normal shade in the same brand or switch to a brand that has a wider variety of shades. Make sure you test the foundation properly on your face to ensure the shade is not too light and will still blend well into your skin.;
, Foundation with SPF is made of ingredients like zinc and titanium. These ingredients can then interact with the color products in the foundation, leading to a change in the shade color.You may opt for a foundation that does not contain SPF so you can avoid a reaction on your face that can lead to an orange tinge. Instead, you may invest in a setting powder that contains SPF so your skin is still protected from the sun but it is not at risk of turning orange.
 You should always test makeup on your skin before you commit to using it full time. You may try wearing a small patch of the foundation on the side of your face for a few hours to make sure it does not react with your skin and create an orange tinge. Or you may apply a full face of foundation and test it out at home for a few hours to ensure the shade does not change color.You should test out all of your makeup products, from foundation to primer to eyeshadow, before you commit to using them on a day to day basis. This will ensure your skin does not have a negative reaction to any of the products.

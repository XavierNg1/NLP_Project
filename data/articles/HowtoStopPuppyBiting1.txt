 If a puppy bites another puppy or its mother too hard, then the bitten pup will give a loud “yip.” This startles the biting puppy and causes him to stop biting. If he continues to bite, then the bitten pup will yelp and run away. Since the puppy doing the biting wants to play he’ll learn to stop biting or else play stops. You can use a similar procedure to teach your puppy not to bite you., If during play, your puppy starts to mouth you and bites or nips, then give a loud, high-pitched “yip.” This should startle your puppy and cause him to stop biting you.Let your hand go limp at the same time that you “yip” and stop playing. If he keeps biting, then walk away from your puppy and only restore attention when he is behaving properly.If he does not stop, then try saying “Too bad!” in a stern voice and walk away from your puppy. Go into another room and ignore your puppy for 10-20 seconds. Doing this will act as a time out and help to teach your puppy that biting too hard makes the play stop., When your puppy does back off, make sure that you give him lots of praise and start playing again. Keep repeating this process every time your puppy nips or bites and he should become gentler and gentler.

 The Twins mostly attack by charging, so an enclosed arena is not recommended. A long skybridge (preferably made of asphalt) is recommended.


You may keep multiple campfires or heart lanterns for faster healing.
You can also connect heart and star statues through wires to gain hearts and mana at crucial times.;
, The Twins are very fast, so Melee weapons are not recommended. You must have the following:


10-20 Healing Potions
10-20 Mana Potions
Mana Flower
Speed Boots (Like Hermes Boots and upgrades)

Wings (If possible)

, Palladium armor is recommended, since it is low tier as well as grants a healing bonus. If palladium is not available, Mithril or Cobalt will also do.
 Weapons required are:


A gun (like MegaShark or Clockwork Assault Rifle)
200-300 Bullets (Any Type)
A sword (in case ammo finishes)
Nimbus Rod (if possible)

, You don't want it to despawn.
, When it is killed, focus on retinazer.
 It does the most damage!

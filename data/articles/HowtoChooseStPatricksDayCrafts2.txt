 Choose an Irish saying, toast or blessing from family history or off the Internet. You can find many that are either religious or secular in nature, such as "May you never forget what is worth remembering, or remember what is best forgotten."


Get a large sheet of black or green tack board, glitter, gold streamers, silver or gold markers and other materials from the craft store.
Cut out a plaque, as large as you would like the sign to be. Draw a square in the middle where the toast will be written. The adults can decide whether they would like to print out the saying on a piece of printer paper or write it in gold pen or marker.
Ask the children to decorate outside of the square. Encourage them to draw, paint, use glitter or whatever methods they choose. They should share the task, in order to encourage cooperation. They can glue gold streamers from the bottom, or you can staple them.
Place the saying on the piece of board. Spray it with a coat of varnish, if the weather is bad, to help protect it. Allow it to dry, and then hang it outside.
 On the morning of St. Patrick's Day, place a small golden bowl filled with gold covered chocolates and mint candies. Place tiny, stick-on footprints, available at craft stores, leading from the pot of gold out the door, to give them the illusion of leprechaun tracks.

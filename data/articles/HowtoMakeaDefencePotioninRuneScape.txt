Collect a marrentill herb. Invest in clean marrentill for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy marrentills are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time. Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.
Collect 1 bear fur. Kill black or grizzly bears for fur drops.
 This will create a "Marrentill Potion (unf)".
 This will create a three dose defence potion.

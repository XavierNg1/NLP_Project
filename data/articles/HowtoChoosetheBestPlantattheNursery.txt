 A large plant might suffer more shock being transferred from the pot to the garden than a smaller one. If you are going to grow a large plant, such as a 2-3 year old tree, get good, solid advice from the nursery employees about its chances and your garden situation, as you're going to be paying a good price for this plant and it's important that it take to your garden well.;
, When looking at the plants you would like to take home, look for any signs of disease.
 This is likely a sign of pest infestation.
 This means it has been sitting in the pot too long and its care has been neglected.
 Again, the plant's needs have been neglected.
 Check soil moisture, pruning, general look etc. Recent pruning might indicate removal of unhealthy growth. Be a careful inspector.
 Once you have discarded some plants for the above reasons, it is a case of which plant looks best in shape and appeals to you most. After a while, you'll get a very quick "feel" for doing this.

 If the fence post has a large concrete base or is very firmly anchored in soil, you may need to use a farm jack (Hi-Lift jack) and chain to pull it out. To prepare for this, dig out the soil around the post to a depth of 1 to 1Â½ feet (0.3 to 0.46 meters). A posthole digger will make this easier.
 Use a pointed digging bar or rock bar to further loosen the soil, or to break up the concrete if possible. Wear eye protection to protect against flying concrete fragments.
 Use a block at least 4 inches (10 cm) thick, with a flat top that can support your jack. Place it across the hole next to the base of the post. Position the block securely so it will not shift during construction. Make sure it is located far enough from the post that the concrete base will not strike the block on its way up.
 Wrap a 3 to 5 foot (0.9 to 1.5 m) length of chain several times around the post, as low to the ground as possible.
 Place the jack on top of the block. Loop the chain tightly around the jack's runner and secure it in place.
 Put on a pair of heavy leather gloves and stand to the side of the jack's handle. Operate the jack to lift the chain and gradually tug the fence post up and out of the ground.

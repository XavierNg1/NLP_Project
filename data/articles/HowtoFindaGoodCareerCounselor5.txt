If you are unemployed, it will probably be easier to go to your local unemployment center to use the career resources there.
Seek out professional career counselors who have at least a master's degree in counseling and specific career development specializations. Ask for references verify whether the career counselor has a state certification/license to practice professional counseling.
Anyone can hang out a shingle and say they are a career coach, so be wary of persons who don't have professional career counseling and development graduate degrees, experience, credentials, and references.
Be wary of career coaches who also advertise themselves as therapists, life coaches or hypnotherapists. It is better to find someone who's main focus is career counseling.

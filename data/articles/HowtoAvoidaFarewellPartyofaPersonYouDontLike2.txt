 Make polite comments about the person to anyone you encounter, especially the departee. There is no need to be grouchy or to leap about whooping about how wonderful it is the person is leaving.
 Explain that you have another pressing engagement or an appointment to anyone who asks.
 Be sure enough work attendees or family members have noted your attendance so that they'll recall you were there at least, then make a hasty retreat for the back door and leave quietly.

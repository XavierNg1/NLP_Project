 Exercise can help you control your blood sugar, so it is essential for diabetes prevention and treatment. Increased exercise makes your cells more sensitive and responsive to the insulin your body produces. Exercise can also lower your blood pressure and strengthen your heart, which is relevant because high blood pressure and heart disease are often associated with diabetes.Try to get at least thirty minutes of moderate exercise every day. When you are just starting out, low-intensity exercises such as walking are helpful as well.
 Strength training will help you to improve your muscle strength and efficiency. The more muscle that you have, the more calories you will burn and the easier it will be to maintain a healthy weight, which is a crucial part of diabetes prevention.Try adding in a couple of strength training sessions per week to your exercise routine to improve your overall fitness level.
 As you progress and get more fit, consider finding a trainer or a class where you can get individualized advice regarding target heart rates and types of exercise. To begin, walking is the easiest way to start, but you can also go swimming or join a yoga class., People often get bored with exercise routines and end up quitting before they achieve any real results. Therefore, it is a good idea to make your routine as varied as possible.Find things that you enjoy so that you stick with your routine. For example, if you have never been particularly interested in sports, you are not likely to stick with competitive sports.
 You can get more physical activity by looking for opportunities in your daily routine. For example, you can try parking your car at the far end of the parking lot when you go grocery shopping or use the stairs instead of the elevator at work.

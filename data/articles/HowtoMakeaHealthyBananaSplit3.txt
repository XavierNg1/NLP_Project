 Make stacks with one piece each of cut pineapple, banana, and strawberry. Press a popsicle stick through each stack. Place the fruit popsicles in an airtight container or freezer bag, and freeze them for one or two hours, or until they’re solid.For best results, use a banana that’s slightly unripe or just turning ripe. Your bites will eventually turn out mushy if your fruit, especially the banana, is too ripe.
 Place the coconut oil and chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds, stir, then repeat until the chocolate is completely melted. If you prefer to use a stovetop, heat the chocolate and oil over low heat and stir constantly.Start melting the chocolate when the fruit becomes solid. Remove the chocolate from heat once it’s melted.
 Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper, so you’ll have somewhere to put your chocolate-dipped popsicles. Dip one side of each fruit stack into the melted chocolate, then let the excess drip. If you’re using chopped nuts or shredded coconut, immediately dip the chocolate-covered fruit popsicle into a bowl of the nut topping.After dipping, place each popsicle onto the parchment paper and let them rest until the chocolate hardens.
 After the chocolate is completely hard, transfer the bites into an airtight container or freezer bag. Place them in the freezer overnight, and store them there until you’re ready to serve.If you pack a lunch with them or want to serve them at an outing, it’s a good idea to transport them with an ice pack to prevent a melted chocolate mess.

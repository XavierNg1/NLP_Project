 A doe is a female deer and is commonly confused with young male deer, or fawns. Female deer do not have antlers and neither do fawns. Typically, the top of a fawns head will be much flatter than a doe's head. Female deer will have longer, more muscular necks than young male deer., Fawns, or baby deer, have small, square bodies, square heads, and large ears. Their bodies and legs are thin and haven't built any significant muscle definition. Sometimes fawns will not have any antlers, so they are easy to confuse with does., Young bucks will have much thinner necks than adult bucks. Once the deer reaches 3 to 3.5 years old, the neck will begin to start to look more muscular. By 4.5 years old, the buck will have a muscular, proportionally sized neck.During breeding season or the rut, a buck's neck will become swollen and large.
 Young deer's legs look much thinner and longer in comparison to its body. Up until three years old, the legs will maintain this thin and long appearance. When the deer reaches 4 1/2 years in maturity, the legs will often look much shorter and stockier in comparison to younger deer.You should also look for dark tarsal glands. These can be found at the joint on the deer's leg and are darker the older the deer is.
 Young deer will have much smaller stomachs and torsos than fully grown deer. Examine the deer's stomach. If it looks stocky or bulky, there's a good chance that the deer is fully matured. Another area to look at is between the neck and chest. As the buck ages, this area will also become larger.

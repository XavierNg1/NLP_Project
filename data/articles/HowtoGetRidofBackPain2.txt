 Do 6 5-minute sessions of walking. Then, begin increasing the time you walk and reducing the number of walking sessions.


For example, the first week, do 6 5-minute sessions. Then, do 4 8-minute sessions the next week. Do 2 15-minute sessions the third week, and work up to at least 1 30-minute session per day. This resembles the recovery therapy for modern back surgeries.

Never sit longer than 30 minutes at a time. Walk to the bathroom, the printer or the watercooler at work. Stand when you take calls, and pace while you are trying to solve a problem. Consider walking on your coffee breaks or lunch breaks. If you do have to sit, then sit with your back straight- good posture. Don't slump over in your chair, this can cause even more back pain.
Reduce the time you spend in front of the TV or computer at home. You should sit no more than a couple hours per day, in addition to time spent sitting at work. Get up during commercial breaks, go for an after-dinner walk or schedule outdoor activities with the whole family 3 times per week.

 Pilates focuses on strengthening the core muscles: the stomach, back, hips and glutes that support the spine. Find a Pilates mat class, go to a physical therapist or find a personal trainer who can focus on simple core strengthening exercises.Commit to at least six weeks of core-building classes.

 Concrete primers will adhere to the basement walls better than general primer, and will provide more durability and protection.
 With the lid on, pick up the primer container and shake it vigorously to mix the contents.
, Generously coat the entire wall surface with the primer.


Use a wide polyester/nylon brush or roller to apply the primer. The brush should be between 2 and 3 inches (5 and 7.6 cm). Choose a 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch (1.3-cm to 1.9-cm) roller cover.
Cut in a 2- to 3-inch (5- to 7.6-cm) border around the top, bottom and sides of the walls. Start by applying primer in 1 corner and continue along the edge of the basement wall.
Paint the primer onto the walls in 4-foot by 2-foot (1.2-m by .6-m) sections. As you apply the paint, overlap into the previously applied areas, including the cut in areas, for consistent coverage.

 Nobody else's baby is nearly as smart or as beautiful or as unique as yours. Make certain to also allow your entire existence to be defined and validated by your new baby, because he or she is certain to be your best friend for the rest of your life. Set your baby's photo (which looks identical to any other baby ever born) as your profile picture.
 Be sure to include links to non-credible biased sources.
 Start a new business from home. Create a Facebook page and add all of your friends to the page or send out multiple invites and constantly remind everyone to "like" your page. Constantly use your personal page to promote your business. Say things such as: "Working out hard at the gym today. Want to see results like these message me and like my Herba Life sales rep page." Send constant updates about webinars, price changes, competitions, one new product an hour, etc.

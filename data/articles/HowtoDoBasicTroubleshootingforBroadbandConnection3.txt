 Look at the back of the router and ensure all cables are properly secured. Trace them back until you reach the wall socket. Check for any broken or faulty cables.
 A simple restart may just do the trick. Wait for about a minute.
 As you do so, observe all the lights on the router.
 Find out if doing the previous steps has resulted in a restored connection.
 If after the restart you still donâ€™t have Internet connection, the problem may be outside your own home or with the service provider. It can also be the router itself.

 The wider the distance between threads on the screw, the better. Make sure that any objects which come into contact with the cork are clean; dirty objects increase the likelihood of tainting your wine.
 Turn the screw into the center of the cork until there is about 1








Work carefully to ensure that the cork does not break apart into smaller pieces.
 Use the pliers to pull the screw out; the cork should come with it. The claw (nail-pulling side) of a hammer also works well in place of pliers, as does a fork. You simply need some object that can grip the screw better than your fingers.
 Simply replace the pliers with the corncob holder, making a T shape. The screw should be vertical and the corncob holder should be horizontal. Place the corncob holder where the prongs are hugging the screw. Place your index and middle fingers on the prongs and handle respectively, and pull up.


Make sure the corncob holder is thinner than the flat end of a small to medium threaded screw.
 Find a bicycle hook (the kind used to hang bikes from rafters). Screw it into the cork. Using the vinyl-coated hook as a handle, pull the cork out, away from your body. This way, you donâ€™t need pliers or another object to remove it.

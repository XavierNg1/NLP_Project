 It should be right when you get home, so you don't forget. Or if you think better after the day is done, you can try after dinner. But be careful not to do it too late.;
, If you are struggling to remember, set an alarm on your phone, computer, game system, etc. so you won't lose track of time with technology.
 Say nicely "In order to get homework in on time, I really need you guys to leave me alone from 3 o'clock to 4:30" or something like that. They'll understand and be proud of you for trying to solve your problem.
 If you feel too tempted, turn the devices off or put them in a separate room.
 Have a folder for every subject and one for random items. Avoid shoving papers into your desk or backpack aimlessly. Of course you will lose them that way.
 It may take weeks, but soon you will get into a rhythm that is hard to break.

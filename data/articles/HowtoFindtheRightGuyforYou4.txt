 In order to really get to know a guy, you have to get to know the people he spends his time with.


Be careful not to confuse his friends' actions with his actions. It's important to see how your man acts around his friends, but don't hold him accountable for way his friends behave on their own.






Make an effort to get to know his family and see where he comes from.



If you're going to be with someone long-term, you want to make sure that he can tolerate doing the things that only interest you, even if it means he has to sit through a chick flick once in a while.






Make sure you'll be able to fulfill your part of the bargain and sit through some activities that might not be your favorite. Compromise is necessary for a healthy relationship, and sometimes you just have to let your guy monopolize the television with his favorite video game for a few hours.



Make sure he is able to talk calmly about problems that arise in your relationship. Small arguments are inevitable in long-term relationships, but it's crucial that your man can communicate with you if something is wrong.
Examine how he deals with stressful news. Life isn't all rainbows and kittens, and stressful situations are bound to arise. The important thing is that your guy supports you in trying times and approaches problems in a rational manner.
See how your man acts when the little things go wrong. For example, if you get stuck in a snowstorm and end up getting towed down a mountain, is he angry for days on end or does he try to remedy the situation? You want to make sure your life partner can deal with less than desirable situations instead of getting angry.

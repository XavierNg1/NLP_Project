 Does he like role playing, racing, sports, mind, or sports games?;
, Does he just not have time and now needs a push from you? Does he have an emotional attachment that he does not wan to recall? Is he afraid of losing? Does he have an injury that prevents him?

,, Also invite him to play at your house so he can get to know the way you live and the way your family is. If they don't know about him, this would be a great introduction as a Friend. Just remember he might be nervous at your house with your family.
 Mix it up, but always go back to the game he is good at. Racing games are generally easier for you to lose at without showing it.

 The first thing to consider before you search for a virtual assistant is where the pain is in your business. Virtual assistants don't only offer administrative support; in reality there are many, many skills you can draw on. Identify the the things that are your core business, the ones that you must do to keep your business operating. Also identify necessary work that may be taking up time you or your onsite employees could reclaim for better purposes.;
, Is there work that you can delegate to someone else so that you stay focused on strategy, marketing and innovation?

, You will gain most from hiring your virtual assistant if it is a long-term relationship. Personality is as important as their skills and abilities.
 You want to make sure that they will be available long-term, and an agency has done most of the selection process for you.
 Start with some small tasks, or a set number of hours,to see how you like working with a person or service you think you will choose.

 The first step in finding a surgeon and location for your operation is talking with your primary care provider. You may need your primary care doctor to write you a referral to a surgeon. They will likely recommend surgeons and hospitals that they have worked with in the past. Often, your choice of surgeon will determine your choice of hospital.When you are talking to your doctor, ask things like “Who would you recommend as a surgeon?” and “What hospital do you recommend?”;
, After you consult your doctor, you should contact your insurer. Unless you are willing to pay out-of-pocket for the surgery, you will need to make sure that any surgeon and you go to is in-network. Depending on the surgery, an out-of-network operation may end up costing you thousands of dollars.When you talk to your insurer, ask questions like “What specialists are covered by my insurance?” and “Is this surgeon in-network?”

, To get the best care, you will want to go to a hospital that has a reputation for treating your condition. General hospitals are great for routine operations like hernias or gallbladder surgery. However, you may need a specialty hospital if you need something like heart bypass or reconstructive surgery. Talk with your primary care provider and your insurer to find the facility that meets your needs and is affordable.Make sure that your surgeon has the ability to admit patients at the hospital you are considering.
Hospitals that perform many of the same types of procedures tend to have higher success rates.

 Write down your thoughts about hemlines and necklines. Do you want a short prom style dress, or a long evening gown? It's also a good idea to think about colors which suit you. For New Years Eve, its usually better to pick "party colors" when buying a dress, such as gold, silver, purple, maroon, navy and black. Set some time aside for shopping. A good time to buy your dress is after Christmas, as shops are usually quiet then. It's best to avoid the first two days straight after Christmas though as stores are crowded because of the sales. December 28th or 29th are good days to go.;
, If your going to a party which will have fireworks, buy a shrug or stylish shawl to go over what you're wearing for when you go outside. If you know you'll be staying inside, then you probably won't need one. If the entire party is going to be hosted outdoors, a dress past the knee with cap sleeves may be an appropriate choice. Dress accordingly., Satin and cotton are good choices, however linen or suede may be less appropriate as they are more summer-like materials., Bows, sequins, embroidery, and beads all look pretty on dresses, however certain types of decoration suit certain dresses. Embroidery is more suited to classical evening gowns, whereas bows can look better on prom dresses.

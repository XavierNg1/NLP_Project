Creating new wiki pages by using this method (creating links from exiting pages) avoids the problem of orphan pages. An orphan is a wiki page that is not linked to any other page.


Click on backlinks (in the upper left corner). The backlinks are the pages that are linked to the current page.
Click on Home Page. You will notice that your previous broken link is no longer broken.
 Be sure that you have added that particular module.


Type in the name of your desired page and click on Create/Edit.
Make the appropriate changes.
Add the comment.
Save your page.

This method has the disadvantage of automatically being orphaned unless you go immediately to the appropriate page and create the link.

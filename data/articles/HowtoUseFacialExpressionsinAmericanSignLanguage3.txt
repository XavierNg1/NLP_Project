If you blow out your cheeks and keep the air inside while closing your lips, it can communicate the concepts of "I didn't say anything", "I didn't tell anything", or "I have nothing more to say".
If you blow out your cheeks and then release the air through your lips slowly it can show frustration, struggle, and/or disapproval.



If you suck in your cheeks as your lips are sucking in air, (as if you are sucking on an imaginary straw) while you sign skinny or small - it is made clear that it is incredibly small, extremely skinny, or super thin.
If you suck in your checks and do not suck in or blow out air, then you could visually describe an animal with narrow features, or an airhead.

 Find a decent amount ammo, a melee weapon(s, firearms, stimpaks and Nuka-colas or other food. These can be purchased, stolen or found in the school itself (though this isn't recommended because the raiders could kill you before you can get them).;
, No mercy. just run around, fire, smash e.t.c until you've cleared a small area. Use small breaks in the firefights to heal up, grab enemy possessions or reload

, The Raiders won't have ALL of the most valuable loot. Just take a look around; I recommend you grab Nuka-colas, ammo, Conductors, Wonderglue, Bottle caps...Basically, anything worth a decent amount whilst not being too heavy for the price.
 Either fast travel or run back to Megaton or the trade caravan usually beside it

, Sell away all of the raider armour/helmets, Low-condition weapons that can't be repaired, Some Psycho, e.t.c

, Restock ammo and repair as much as you can and try again on another Raider hideout if you want

, first go to supply create shop in megaton. then look in the shop keeper's inventory, then if you have two same weapons on your inventory sell both of them to her(and make sure they vary in price.)then exit out of the inventory list. then get on it again and buy the cheapest one. after that when you look at the weapon you bought, it is fully repaired and very valuable.
 Steal everything in Megaton after you leave the vault (unless you are a good character of course). Alcoholic items are some of the most valuable common items. Also when you are in the vault take your time and gather everything make sure to leave nothing behind.

 This fee-based service may be available at local antique shops or malls, or through private experts. Look in the phone book or online to set up an appointment and have your linens assessed before selling them.
 Make sure they are cleaned and freshly pressed. The dealer is likely to offer less than what your appraiser said they were worth, in order to make a profit on their sale, so decide if you think you are getting a good deal before selling.
 Places like VintageLinens.com buy good quality antique linens. Check the "Contact us" or "About us" sections to learn about their policies.
 This only auction site is perfect for vintage items. Take good quality pictures and post them with a minimum bid.
 A textile museum uses these linens to display or teach. Contact museums or museum houses to see if your linens can be donated.

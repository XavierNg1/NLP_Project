 Before you delve into creating your own shortcuts, make sure that you are familiar with all of the shortcuts that your iPhone's operating system has already built-in.
 To quickly enter a number or symbol without switching keyboards, simply tap the "123" icon at the bottom of your keypad and, without lifting your finger, slide to the number or symbol you want. Once you select it you may let go and your keyboard will return to "ABC.", If you want to type in all capital letters, double-tab the shift icon until it changes to an up arrow with a line under it. To go back to normal, tap it again.
 To enter a special character, hold down the letter associated with it and then select from the pop up menu. For example, if you want to the letter "รก" hold down "a" and select it from the given options.
 To quickly insert a period, double tap the space bar.

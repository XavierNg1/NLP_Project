 If your family respects this relative’s opinion, you might fear the backlash you receive from turning down advice. If other relatives agree with your relative who is a therapist, it can be even harder to go against their advice. Regardless of how other people feel, however, some decisions are only yours to make. Consider the advice, take some deep breaths, and face the choices.For example, if several family members think you should attend Alcoholics Anonymous but you don’t benefit from going, it’s okay to make your own choice, even if you fear their reactions.
 You might be fearful in saying no because you respect your relative and don’t want to hurt or disappoint them (or your family). It’s important to balance disappointing someone with what’s good for you, even if that person offers expert advice. If your judgment concludes you don’t want to take the advice, it’s okay to say no.Sometimes you do things for your family because it’s the right thing to do. Other times, you do things because it’s right for you. Say, “I’m sorry if you feel disappointed that I’m making another choice. I believe this to be what’s best for me.”

, Your relative may give you sound advice, and if you choose not to take it, then you may regret it. This can be a reality, so prepare for whatever outcome arises. Your relative may say, “I told you so” or try to help you get back on your feet. Whatever happens, accept the responsibility of making the decisions for yourself. It is important to hold yourself accountable so that you can learn from your mistakes.


Be empowered in your decisions, yet take responsibility for them, too.

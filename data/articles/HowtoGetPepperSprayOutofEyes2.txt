 Pepper spray leaves an oily residue on your skin and in your eyes which you need to clean off as quickly as possible. The most straightforward way to do this is just by flushing your face and eyes with cool water. You should do this for at least fifteen minutes.After doing this, keep the affected areas open to the air. Being exposed to the air helps the irritant evaporate after you've flushed your eyes with water.
If you have access to a sink or drinking fountain use this. Otherwise, use any clean water you can get hold of. You can also stand under a cold shower to rinse off., Flushing your face and eyes with water can help to wash off the oily pepper spray residue. To help remove it from your skin, you can add some mild, non-oil-based soap or dish detergent. Make a solution of one quarter mild detergent with three quarters cool water.Keeping your eyes firmly shut, dip your face into the solution for twenty seconds.
Rinse off your face and repeat ten times.
Refresh the solution after each rinse, so you are not putting your face back into pepper spray water.

Don't get soap into your eyes. It will only further irritate them.
 There may be some oily residue left in your eyes after the burning sensation has begun to subside. To tackle this you can use some saline eye drops to flush out any final irritants. Just apply a few drops directly to your eyes and blink continuously.


You can buy these drops in drug stores, supermarkets and pharmacies.
Remember not to rub your eyes even after doing this.

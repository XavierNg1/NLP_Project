 Search engines do not rank the largest photos, because it is hard to process the data. However, you will need to find a file size that shows your image clearly without being too large.
 Use a few words, with dashes to separate them. For example, you might type blue-harbor-sunset.jpg to create an online image for a Blue Harbor Sunset photo.


Never use underscores in place of dashes. Google and other search engines see dashes as spaces, but underscores as word joiners., The rest of the information that you add to an image will make it popular in the search engine results. Your photo must have more information than just a file name to be viral, or even popular.
 This is where knowledge of keywords comes into play. Edit an alt tag to be a description of the photo in terms that people might use to find a photo on an image search.


For example, your blue-harbor-photo might use an alt tag of ocean-sunset or blue-ocean-sunset because people frequently look for ocean sunset photos using these terms.
Keep your alt tag under 150 characters, including dashes.
Use dashes, not underscores, to separate keywords.
For best results, do some keyword research before you title the photos to ensure you are using a specific, yet popular set of search terms.
 This information will also be available to search engines to describe the photo, in case other methods donâ€™t show up. Write a sentence or less describing the image., Linking the image to a URL will direct the person who finds your photo on an image search back to the website of your choice. This is essential if you want the person to buy a print of the photo or to see more of your work.

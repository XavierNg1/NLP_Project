 Cereal boxes or tissue boxes are particularly good choices.


If using a long tissue box, turn the box over so the open end (for tissues) isn't seen.
 Start about 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the front of the car and 3 inches (7.6 cm) below the top. Cut upwards to the top, across the top, and 3 inches down the other side.









Use sharp scissors or a box cutter for this step.
, This step depends on what kind of box you're working with, and what kind of car you want.


For a sedan, repeat Step 2 on the opposite end of the box.
For an old-fashioned Model-T type car, skip this step.
 Do this with the sharp end of the scissors. You may want to measure out and mark the points in advance to make sure they are equidistant.
 They should run between the two sets of pierced points where the wheels will go.









Alternatively, you can use plastic straws, pencils, or pens. Do not use pipe cleaners, as they bend too easily.
 Cut four wheels of equal diameter out of another piece of cardboard.









It's preferable to use a stiffer type of cardboard than the type found in cereal and tissue boxes.
 If using a skewer, you can poke a hole in the wheel with the sharp end. Otherwise, you'll need to make a small hole in the wheels so they can fit on the axel. Use the sharp tip of your scissors; don't make the hole too large or the wheel will fall off!








, You can use markers, crayons and stickers, or glue colored paper onto the car. If you're really ambitious, you can paint it with tempera or finger paints.









Don't be afraid to leave the original design of the box as is, if you like it. The novelty can be a very charming part of the toy, and you can make a collection of several cars from different boxes.

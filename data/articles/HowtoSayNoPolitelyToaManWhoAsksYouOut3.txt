 Sometimes, however, it takes a date to figure out that you really aren’t interested.


Say something like, “I’m sorry. I just didn’t really feel a connection on our date. Hope you find someone great!”
If you aren’t attracted to him but want to be friends say, “I had a lot of fun with you, but I didn’t really feel a romantic connection. Would you like to be friends with me?” Asking him if he wants to be friends is straightforward and lets him know that even though you don’t want to date, you still appreciate interactions with him.
 Once you know that you’re not into a guy, you should let him know. The longer you wait to tell him you don’t want to go out again, the more difficult it will become.


If you’ve only been out on a date or two, it’s fine to tell him you’re not interested in a text message.That way, you can craft a tactful message, and he doesn’t have to feel embarrassed in person.
However, if you know you’re not interested at the end of your first date, go ahead and let him know. Before you part ways, say something like, “Hey. Just so you know I don’t think there’s really anything here for me, but I’m glad we got the chance to go out.” This will save you from agonizing over when to tell him.
 Once you’ve told him that you’re no longer interested, don’t keep talking to him. Even if you both want to be friends, it can be good to have a little distance at first.


If he continually texts you after you’ve rejected him, it’s okay to ignore the messages.
If you do talk to him, be careful to avoid flirting or confusing him.

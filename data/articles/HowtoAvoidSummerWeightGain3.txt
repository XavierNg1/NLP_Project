 Try to establish rules for yourself and your household about watching television, playing on the computer, and using mobile devices. You’re typically inactive during screen time, and watching TV and movies also encourages unhealthy snacking. Try to limit screen time to a couple hours at night so you can stay as active as possible during the day., Don’t skip your workout if it’s too hot to go for a run or exercise outdoors. Instead, go to the gym, run on an indoor track, or go swimming.If it's too hot by the late morning or afternoon, you can also try exercising outdoors in the early morning or later in the evening.
We tend to walk and move slower when we’re outside in the heat. Missing out on more strenuous forms of aerobic exercise can lead to weight gain.
 Play outdoors with your kids or pets. Try having field days, in which you play your favorite sports or outdoor games, in the backyard or a nearby park. Go for hikes, brisk walks, or take on a new recreational hobby or activity together, like swimming or kayaking., Look for a nearby instructional or informal sports league, like soccer, softball, baseball, or kickball. Practices and games will help you develop a routine, keep yourself occupied, and stay in shape. If you don’t like sports, consider joining another community activity, like a bike group or jogging club.Search online for a local community or recreation center and ask about age-appropriate summer leagues and activities for you or your family. You can also ask your neighborhood association about informal bike or jogging clubs in your area.

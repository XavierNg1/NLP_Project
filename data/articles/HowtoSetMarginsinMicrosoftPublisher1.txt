 The "Layout Guides" dialog box is where you control the page margins for your Microsoft Publisher publications.


In Publisher 2003 and 2007, select "Layout Guides" from the "Arrange" menu.
In Publisher 2010, select "Custom Margins" from the "Margins" dropdown button in the "Page Setup" group of the "Page Design" menu ribbon.
Publisher 2010 also offers 4 preset margin options on the "Margins" dropdown button menu: Wide, Moderate, Narrow, or None. The Moderate option offers the same margin widths as the initial values displayed on the "Margin Guides" page of the "Layout Guides" dialog box.;
, In most cases, this tab will already be selected when you open the "Layout Guides" dialog box.
 The spin box controls set the page margins for your publication. Click the up arrow to increase a margin or the down arrow to reduce a margin. You can also enter a value directly in the box. The Preview pane on the right of the "Margin Guides" page shows the result of your margin adjustment.


Use the Inside spin box to adjust the margins between the page text and the center of the layout.
Use the Outside spin box to adjust the margins between the page text and the horizontal edges of the layout.
Use the Top spin box to adjust the margin between the top of the page text and the top of the page layout.
Use the Bottom spin box to adjust the margin between the bottom of the page text and the bottom of the page layout.
You can set the values in these spin boxes only as low as the minimum margins supported by your printer. To determine the minimum margins for your printer, follow the instructions under "Determining the Nonprintable Region for Your Printer."

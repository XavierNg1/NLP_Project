 Go through your cellphone images and add up how many selfies you have saved in your phone. If you have more than five to ten within a two week period, you may have a selfie problem.


You may also notice that you only have photos of yourself or very few photos of other people besides yourself. This could be a sign that you are only using your cellphone to take pictures of yourself, rather than document others around you or events that happen in your life.;
, Try to keep track of how many selfies you take a day. Notice if you take one selfie a day, such as right before you leave for work or for school, or if you take multiple selfies a day, such as once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and a few times a night. This may be an indication that you are taking a lot of selfies every day., You should consider how you view your selfies, especially if you take a lot of them. Maybe you enjoy how you look and want to share your appearance with others. But if you find yourself critiquing how you look in your selfies, you may not be comfortable with your appearance and this could be unhealthy.Ask yourself several questions, such as: Do I appreciate how I look my selfies? Do I manipulate my selfies with filters or settings on my phone to make myself look a certain way? What do the selfies mean to me? What purpose do they serve?

, You may need some perspective on your selfie habits to determine if you have a problem. Ask your friends if they feel like you take a lot of selfies on your phone and if they think you may have an addiction to selfies. You may also ask your friends if they feel you only use your cellphone for selfies and not for other things, as this could be a sign of a selfie addiction.


Try to ask friends that will be honest and upfront with you. Be willing to accept their feedback and listen to what they have to say. Getting an honest, outside perspective can help you determine if you are a little too into selfies.

 When you are looking for writing jobs, you should make your writing samples, resume and contact information easily accessible for potential employers. Build a website for yourself. It doesn’t have to be flashy or fancy, but it should represent yourself professionally.


Take special care to ensure that you don’t have any spelling or grammatical errors. If you want to get hired as a writer, all of your writing should be meticulous, including the writing on your website.
 One of the first things that someone will do before hiring you for a job is search online for you. Make sure you are represented in a positive light by searching for yourself online. Then work to improve your online presence.
 People connect on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and others. These sites are great ways to cultivate personal and professional connections.A client may not be actively seeking out your services, but he might come across your material through a friend’s connection and decide to hire you. Getting your name out there is crucial for finding writing gigs.
 While many people may only promote themselves online, there are other ways to promote yourself. These “low-tech” ways may even reach people you aren’t reaching online, exposing you to more potential business.


Try making a brochure, or attend a writer’s conference. You can also place ads in a local or regional newspaper or on Craigslist.
 It may be uncomfortable for you to talk about what a skilled writer you are. But if you want others to believe it, you need to tell them. This doesn’t mean that you need to constantly talk about how great you are, but you need enough confidence to reassure a potential employer that you have the chops necessary to do a good job.

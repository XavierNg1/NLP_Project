 If there is any finish left on the metal, it will interfere with the bluing process. This will result in an uneven and ineffective bluing. Grind and sand the piece until you have removed any and all finishes. You should see only bare metal., If there are any pits in the metal, this is the time to deal with them. Use your sander or grinder to take the metal down around the pit. This will smooth the metal and give you a better finish., Gloves will not only protect your hands, but they will also protect the metal from your hands. Your hands will leave oils on the metal that interfere with the bluing process. Wear nitrile or latex gloves to keep this oil from reaching the metal., Clean the metal with an alcohol wipe. You should then follow by cleaning it with a wax and grease remover (an organic solvent). Finally, use a soft cloth to dry the metal.

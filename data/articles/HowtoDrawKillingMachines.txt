 Its appearance will depend on its talents and strengths. Make a short list of all its preferences and style of killing. For example, does it kill quickly or slowly? Does it prefer to chase down its victims in play daylight or creep around in the shadows? To draw a realistic killing machine, you must decide what type of robot you want.
 Since you are aware of its capabilities and killing style, you can base your robot off of your list. Jot down the weapons and type of armor it will have, as well as any significant features that you want it to have. Decide whether you want your machine to appear human or not.

Be realistic. If your robot prefers to sneak up on its victims, add lighter armor for stealth, as well as concealable weapons. While heavy, chunky armor might seem cool, it will only slow it down and make the killing machine appear less believable.
 Once you have planned out its appearance and style, it becomes easier to sketch your robot. For an action-filled drawing, decide on a pose that will bring out your machine’s style. It will also help your art look unique., Make a rough draft of its appearance and pose. For practice, draw the armor and weapons separately before attempting to place it on the machine. Use references to help your machine appear realistic, but avoid directly copying from images., As soon as you have finished practicing with sketches, start drawing the official piece. Add shading and highlights in the correct areas in order to bring out the killing machine’s beauty. If desired, ink the entire drawing for a professional appearance. You can also color it with coloring pencils or scan it into your computer to digitally color it.

It is recommended that you make a copy of your drawing or trace it onto another piece of paper. That way, you can experiment with coloring without ruining your piece.
Use menacing colors that will intimidate viewers. Experiment with different shades and combinations for the best look.

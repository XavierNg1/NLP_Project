 Because not all dogs have the upper body strength to do this trick, speak with your vet before teaching your dog this trick. If your dog does not have the upper body strength, you might inadvertently injure your dog while teaching it this trick.Age is also a factor. It is recommended that you wait until your dog is an adult before teaching it to do a handstand. Additionally, arthritis or other conditions might prevent older dogs from being able to perform this trick.
 When teaching your dog this trick, remember to take it slow. Your dog is using muscles that it does not normally use. Therefore, if you are in a hurry, you might inadvertently injure your dog. By taking it slow, you are allowing your dog’s muscles time to adjust and strengthen., When teaching this trick, a clicker is very useful. Whenever your dog performs the correct behavior, click and reward the behavior with a treat. It is important that you click while the correct behavior is being performed and not after.


If you do not have a clicker, cue words such as “up” or “yes” accompanied with a treat will work, too.

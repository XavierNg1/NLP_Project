 Olive oil and canola oil are the healthiest oils that you can use in your cooking. Other nut and seed oils also make healthy choices. Prepare fatty fish like salmon or mackerel instead of beef. Avocados are also an excellent source of healthy fats.
 Trans fats are found in foods that have been hydrogenated so that they can maintain shelf stability at room temperature. These fats are universally understood to be bad for your health, and they hide in places you might not expect. Before you roll a piece of chicken in bread crumbs, check the package to make sure that the crumbs donâ€™t contain trans fats. Also, avoid margarine and shortening in your cooking whenever possible.
 Investing in an excellent olive oil for cooking allows you to put more flavor in your food even while using less oil. Another idea is to choose a creamy European butter; the intense flavor will allow you to cut the butter content in your cooking by at least one-third.

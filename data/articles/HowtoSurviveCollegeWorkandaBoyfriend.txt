 Your happiness comes first; you shouldn't be doing something only because everyone else thinks it would be best for you. Only you can decide what's best for you.;
, Find out what's the most important, but don't deem the others insignificant.. just realize what (in an extreme case) you would put before another.
 If your job hours change, then your schedule might be a little more loose; but you should try to keep it as close as possible. Don't schedule anything else into this time.
 Use it to plan ahead. Big assignments are easier if you work on them a little at a time, as opposed to being "surprised" into cramming all the work into the night before class.
 Studying or other activities may be important, but not more important than getting enough uninterrupted sleep. If you just have to go without, have a cup of coffee and exercise for about ten of twenty minutes before you go to work (or class). That should wake you up enough to get through the day.
 It's easier to work if you're thinking about the things you like, rather than the things you hate.
 It's easy to start thinking about that important essay, or what movie you and your boyfriend are going to catch later that night, but it can affect your performance! It's hard to work when your mind is elsewhere; it also tends to make the day go by slower.
 . It's not sucking up, it's making an effort to get to know him/her as a person. Trust me, they'll appreciate your effort and it will be easier getting that weekend off that you really need.
 Once you've gotten everything done and you have time to yourself, use it! Live in the moment and enjoy!

 If your dog's bed does not have removable bedding, you will have to soak the entire bed (or cushion insert) to clean it. Fill the bathtub full of warm water. Add a capful of laundry detergent and a 1/4 cup (60 ml) of apple cider vinegar or white vinegar.To remove very strong odor, add a 1/2 cup of vinegar.
 Put your dog's foam bed (or the foam cushion insert of the bed) into the bathtub. Make sure it is completely submerged. Soak the bed for 10-15 minutes., Drain the bath completely. Rinse the dog bed or cushion under warm water. Squeeze the bed until all the soap is rinsed out.
 Remove the bed or cushion insert from the tub. If weather permits, place the bed outside to dry. If not, place near a heater to dry indoors.

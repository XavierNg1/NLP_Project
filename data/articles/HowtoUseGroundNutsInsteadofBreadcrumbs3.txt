 Recipes for meatballs or meatloaf require breadcrumbs to act as a binder for the meat. Make your meatloaf or meatballs the same way as your normally would, combining ground meat with eggs and spices. Instead of adding breadcrumbs as a binder, however, try adding ground nuts instead.

You can also use almond meal or almond flour.Experiment with different quantities of nuts until your meat reaches the consistency and texture that you desire.
 Instead of coating your chicken with flour or breadcrumbs, consider using ground nuts instead. You can use similar cook times, just pay attention to the surface of your food. Dredge your chicken in your egg wash and then fully coat them with ground up nuts. Once your chicken is coated, fry it over the stovetop or cook it in the oven as your normally would.

Reduce overall cooking times by using thinner pieces of chicken so that your ground nut coating does not burn while it's being fried.
 You can fry fish on the stovetop the same way that you'd normally do so when covered in breadcrumbs. Coat your fish fillets in your egg wash or a chia seed jelly before coating them in your ground nuts. For lighter fish, make sure to finely grind up your nuts.

A fish fillet will only need about 2-3 minutes of cooking time on medium-high heat on a skillet., Coat your vegetables with the eggwash or flax mixture before covering them in nuts. You can either pan fry the vegetables on medium heat until they are golden brown, or you can cook vegetables like zucchini in the oven at 450Â°F for 10 minutes.Experiment with different vegetables like peppers, onions, cauliflower, eggplant, and okra.

 Just like iron ore, you'll need to smelt the gold ore in a furnace to turn it into usable ingots. Don't bother making golden tools or armor unless you like the look, since they're weaker than iron. Instead, use the ingots for the special items described below.
 Place a redstone in the center of the crafting area, with one golden ingot on each side (four total). This makes a clock which shows you the position of the sun or moon.


Place an item frame (eight sticks and one leather) on the wall and place a clock in it to make a wall clock., Place a stick in the middle of the craft area, fill the left and right columns with gold ingots (six total), and place redstone at the bottom. This powered rail will make mine carts move on their own, if you power it with a redstone torch or powered redstone circuit.
 If you want to start a redstone circuit when something falls on or walks over a square, build a pressure plate with two ingots side by side.
 Place an apple in the center of the craft area and surround it completely with golden ingots (nine total). This will make a golden apple, an excellent healing and protection item that you can eat even with full hunger.


You can make a more powerful "Notch apple" in most version of Minecraft by using gold blocks (see below) instead of ingots. This recipe will disappear in Minecraft 1.9., Flaunt your wealth by filling the crafting table with golden ingots to make a single golden block. This bright yellow cube is mostly used just for decoration.
 A single ingot anywhere in the crafting area will turn into a pile of gold nuggets. These have a few uses:Glistering Melon: Melon slice completely surrounded by nuggets. Used for potions.
Golden Carrot: Carrot surrounded by nuggets. Used for potions, food, and breeding/ healing horses.
Firework Stars: To make a firework, place any dye in the center and gunpowder to its left. Adding a gold nugget directly below the dye during crafting makes the firework star-shaped instead.

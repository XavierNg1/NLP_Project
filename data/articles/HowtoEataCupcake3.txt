 Set the bottom of the cupcake down onto a plate or in a shallow bowl.


This method works well with both standard and filled cupcakes. You will be eating the various parts of the cupcake—frosting, filling, and cake—separately instead of enjoying them at the same time. This is a very non-traditional way to enjoy a cupcake, but it works well for people who don't enjoy mixing flavors.
 Use a spoon to scrape away the frosting a little at a time. Eat each spoonful of frosting as you scrape it away. Continue eating the frosting in this way until the top of the cupcake is frosting-free.


Unless you have a massive sweet tooth, you should eat the frosting in small bites.
If necessary, you can pile some of the frosting into the corner of your dish to save for later. This can be done if the sweetness of the frosting becomes too intense as you eat it or if you want to save a little for the end.
 Use your spoon to dig out and eat the filling from the center of a filled cupcake. If the filling is already exposed, the job is easy. If it is covered by the top of your cupcake, use your spoon to carefully dig out a small chunk of cake from the center top to expose the filling beneath.


You can either eat the removed portion of the cake immediately or set it off to the side to enjoy with the rest of the cake.
 At this point, a hollowed-out, frosting-free cake should be all that remains. You can eat it with your spoon, but you can also eat it by picking it up with your hands and taking bites directly out of it.

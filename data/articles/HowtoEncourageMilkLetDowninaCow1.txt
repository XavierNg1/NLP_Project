 Once she is in her milking area, just rub, up and down her udder, around the teats, and possibly massage the teats as well (optional, not necessary). Do this for at least 30 seconds.;
, Pat it on the bottom, on the sides, etc. Find the spot she likes best, and that will increase the chances of milk let down. Do this for at least 10 seconds, after rubbing her udder.
 Don't be rough, but gently bump the bottom of her udder 4-5 times.
 Then you should be ready to milk!

 In a basic sense, remain behind the tame at all times while in a close proximity. Avoid hitbox contact with the tame.

The only exception to this line of sight rule is the Ichthy.
 Passive tames do not require the owner to render the animal or dino unconscious. Once again the tame requires a certain food, depending on whether it is a herbivore or a carnivore. Wait until the option reappears, for the food bar of the tame requires a drop before the animal can consume again. In other words, the tame needs to become "hungry" again., Once again, some will not require a saddle to ride the dino or animal.

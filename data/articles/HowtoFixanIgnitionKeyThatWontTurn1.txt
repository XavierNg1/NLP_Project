 If your steering wheel is locked, it may be pushing against the lock pin and making it difficult to turn the key. This being the case, the wheel will only have give in one direction. You should turn it slightly in that direction (just enough so that it feels springy) and hold it in place.There is no need to rock the wheel.;
, This is the ideal way to start your vehicle, especially if you are driving an automatic. Many vehicle’s won’t start at all if you are in any other gear.
 Again, many vehicles will not start if the brake is not engaged.
 Now that the pressure is off of the lock pin, the key should turn normally.

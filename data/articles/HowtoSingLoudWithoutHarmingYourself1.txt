 It's a bit harder to belt it with your head voice. But, with your chest voice, you can get a much more audible sound. And if you are worried that you won't be able to get as high as you want to sing, you would be surprised as to as high your chest voice can go. Just keep experimenting with it, and in no time, you should be able to get pretty high.;
, Don't immediately get loud if you're a quiet singer; you might end up hurting or straining your voice. Rather, practice slowly getting louder. Try some vocal warm-ups where you stay on one note and slowly get louder. Then, grow softer. Repeat that a few times to get the feel of how loud you can really go without hurting your voice.
 Now, don't do anything with screaming; that will definitely strain your voice. Just do songs that you feel your voice is comfortable with, and you can gradually move your way up to louder songs. Just nothing with screaming or intense shouting.
 One of the key things to singing louder is having confidence. Dare yourself to sing louder in public places, like choir or church. When you build up confidence, your voice will naturally be louder.

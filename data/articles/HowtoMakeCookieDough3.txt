 Beat the butter and sugar together in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until fluffy.


This should take about 5 minutes.
Make sure that the butter is softened before combining it with the sugar.
For this recipe, it is not necessary to beat the butter by itself first.
For this recipe, an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment works best. A standard mixer attachment may also be used, however.
 Add these ingredients to the creamed butter mixture and beat with your electric mixer until thoroughly combined.


If doubling the recipe, add each egg one at a time and beat well after each addition.
Use a medium speed when adding these ingredients.
 Thoroughly mix the flour into the moist ingredients in two or more batches.


Use a low speed to prevent the flour from flying out as you mix it.
Only mix until the flour has been incorporated. Do not overmix.
If the mixer begins to slow and struggle, stir the rest of the flour in using a mixing spoon.
 Each portion should be about equal in size.


It may be easier to work with four portions later on, but two portions will also suffice.
 Place each portion of dough on a sheet of plastic wrap. Flatten the dough into disks before wrapping it completely.


Each portion of dough should be wrapped separately.
Make sure that no air can touch the wrapped dough. If necessary, double-wrap the dough to secure it.
 Refrigerate the dough up to 1 week. If you need the dough to last up to 4 weeks, you should freeze it, instead.


Note that even if you plan to use the dough immediately, it should still be refrigerated 2 hours before baking.
 Bake the cookies an an oven preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) for 8 to 10 minutes or until slightly golden.


If using frozen dough, wait until the dough has dropped down to refrigerated temperatures.
Roll the dough out on a floured surface until it is about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick. Cut into shapes and placed on greased cookie sheets to bake.

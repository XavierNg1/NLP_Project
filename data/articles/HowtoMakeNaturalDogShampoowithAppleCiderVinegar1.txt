 This is what will get your pet’s coat and skin dirt/debris free. Your dog may not like the smell but you will be balancing out the cider with other ingredients so it shouldn’t be too overpowering.


Apple cider vinegar is also a natural flea repellent so it should help to block and kill any remaining fleas.;
, You could also use baby shampoo if you prefer--either will make suds and add that extra cleaning element to the bath.
 Glycerin will also soothe any hotspots or areas of dander build up.
 Actually any clean, empty bottle will do the trick, but be sure you select something that is plastic or non breakable. Doggy bath times can be a little rambunctious so the last thing you need is to be fighting a wild bathing dog while navigating the shampoo bottle over his coat.

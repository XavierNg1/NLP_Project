 You don't want to be nervous while you lie. It's good to think of the positive thing while you lie. Say, for example, 'If I lie about this, everyone will be happy', so think about the smiles you will make. Don't think about if you're going to be in trouble or anything negative. Nervous wrecks usually get caught immediately.;
, There are certain telltale signs that people look for if they suspect you of lying, so study these signs and make sure you don't betray yourself with body language. Don't tap your finger on anything for any reason. Don't look around everywhere - make solid eye contact with those you're talking to. Keep your voice exactly as smooth and sure as it is normally - if you usually speak with a stutter, don't stop, as this will be suspicious.
 Not the kind of smile that makes people suspicious, but the one that makes it look like you don't care if you're in trouble or not. Be authentic and carefree.
 Lean back in your chair like it's a normal conversation. You can even sleep. Act like you're bored. Be lazy. Calm down and act as if you haven't even given the situation any thought. Or if you're standing up act bored and tired. Maybe yawn and look at them with eyes that look like 'Really? You're wasting OUR time.'

, If you're not the one for calming down, then laugh. But it's got to be something that'd sound ridiculous if you hadn't actually done it.
 If you seem really defensive and all of that, denying everything, then you most likely will be caught eventually. Just sit back, relax, and stick to your story.

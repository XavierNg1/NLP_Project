 Fill the bucket three quarters of the way full with warm water, then add half a cup of ammonia. The ammonia will help loosen stuck-on dirt and stains, allowing them to be scrubbed away with ease.Be sure to take the proper safety precautions when working with ammonia. Pull on a pair of rubber dish gloves and a facemask to protect you from harsh fumes.
 Use the brush head to stir the solution and soak the bristles in preparation for scrubbing. Shake off the excess solution into the bucket.

Pick a brush with natural or synthetic bristles. Wire brushes can cause scratches when used on brick or leave behind small flakes of metal that will eventually rust.Ammonia gives off noxious vapors, so stand clear of the bucket while mixing and dipping.
 Run the brush across the surface of the wall using short, forceful motions to break down stubborn residue and discoloration. Make sure you scrub the entire wall to prevent any one section from come out with a different degree of coloration. Continue scrubbing until the wall is completely clean, adding fresh solution to the brush every so often.If you’re having difficulty removing dirt, try scrubbing the spot from different angles.
You’ll need to apply quite a bit of pressure to penetrate into the cracks and crevices of the brick., Hose off the brick to rinse away all traces of the ammonia solution, along with whatever debris it helped dissolve. Let the wall drip dry. Try to get in the habit of scrubbing exterior walls with ammonia once or twice a year, or more frequently if you live in an area with a lot of dust or rainfall.If you have a power washer or a hose with a separate pressure nozzle, you can use it on a low pressure setting to knock out dirt that has settled down deep.Ammonia may damage the brick if left to soak into the wall.

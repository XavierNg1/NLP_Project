Before you can breed this dragon you must unlock it from the Deus Vault.
, To make a Queen dragon, you need to choose a Medieval dragon and a Nenufar dragon.


To select the dragons, tap one dragon on the left side and another on the right side of the screen.
 This will start the breeding process.
 Breeding time will depend on the rarity of the dragon.


You can also speed up the process by using gems.
 You will see an egg there; wait for it to be ready to hatch.


Tap on "Hatch" when it is ready. You now have a Queen dragon.
When asked “What would you like to do with your new Queen dragon?” tap on "Place."

 Lets say it's Isabella. Isabella is quite a popular name at the moment. What are some funky possibilities? Bella? Nah. If you want to stand out never choose a common quiet name. Be loud and outrageous so that everybody thinks how cool your name is and wants it too.;
, Say like "Hi, I'm..." Or "Cool!! I'm..." If you think it sounds slightly plain change it!!! Nobody likes a dull Jack, Sophie or Eleanor! Be outgoing! So if your nickname is Elizabeth, don't go for the boring Lizzie or Beth! Be outrageous, like Elzy or Elizo! Make sure its not too outrageous that you feel embarrassed introducing yourself, or it will never catch on.
 Send a text or phone them or go visit their houses and ask them, not too desperately, but along the lines of "Hey! What you up to? Hey, please can you call me ____ from now on? It just sounds cool, that's all." If they refuse, don't worry about it. Perhaps they need time!

, If this is successful, your on the track to success. If not, you probably have known them for too long, or they don't like you, but don't be put down! Keep on trying!

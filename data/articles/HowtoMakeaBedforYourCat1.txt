 Get a nice big cardboard box. You may be able to ask for one at your local supermarket. It must be in good condition, and must be big enough to hold your cat., Using a pair of scissors or a box-cutter, carefully remove the top “flaps” from the box. You may want to save these for future art projects. Leave the bottom “flaps” intact., You are going to create a U-shaped opening in the front of your box to act as a doorway for your cat. First, take a pencil and mark the location you plan to cut. Then, using your scissors or box-cutter, carefully cut this opening in your box., Using construction paper or fabric, and some craft glue, decorate the outside of your box. This will transform your cardboard box into an attractive cat bed., The final step is to create a soft area inside the box for your cat to rest upon. This may be a folded up towel, some quilt backing, stuffing, or a pillow the right size. Place your soft materials in the bottom of your box, and your cat bed is ready for use!

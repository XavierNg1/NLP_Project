 This will help you decide which system will be most beneficial for you. The following are the most well-known forms of shorthand today:



Pitman. First presented by Sir Isaac Pitman in 1837. Notable features: phonetic (records the sound of a letter or word rather than its spelling); utilizes thickness and length of strokes; symbols consist of dots, lines and dashes; system of abbreviations within Pitman shorthand.Level of difficulty: hard.


Gregg. Introduced by John Robert Gregg in 1888. Notable features: phonetic (records the sound of a letter or word rather than its spelling); vowels are written as hooks and circles on the consonants. Level of difficulty: moderate/hard.


Teeline. Developed in 1968 by James Hill as an easier alternative to traditional shorthand. Notable features: based on letters rather than on phonetics; of the symbol systems, most closely resembles the English alphabet. Level of difficulty: easy.


Keyscript Shorthand. Invented in 1996 by Janet Cheeseman, Keyscript is based on Pitman, but is fully alphabetical, using none of the Pitman symbols, but only the ordinary lowercase letters of the alphabet. It is phonetic. Level of difficulty: easy/moderate.

, If you learn best in a structured classroom setting, consider taking a formal course on shorthand. If you are a quick learner and prefer to learn independently, you may be able to teach yourself.
 If learning a traditional method of shorthand seems too daunting, or if you are feeling particularly creative, consider inventing your own form of abbreviated writing.

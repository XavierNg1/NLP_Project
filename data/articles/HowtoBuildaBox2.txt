 You will need to make sure that all of your wall pieces are the same height. The opposite walls need to be the same length. You will also need a bottom piece that will fit inside of the finished box.
 At the ends of each of the wall piece, cut a 45° angle out from the inside of each edge. These 45° angles will meet and create flush corners with no grain showing.


Use a miter box to create exact angles. This will make for seamless joints. Make sure that when you cut the 45° angle that you do not affect the overall length of the wall pieces.
 Place each wall piece end to end on the tape so that the edges are touching. The pieces are laid out as if the box walls have been “unrolled”.
 Let the glue set and keep pressure applied by using a clamp. Once the glue is set, apply glue to the rest of the exposed edges of the bottom piece.
 Apply a strong wood glue to the 45° wall corners. Score the edges with a file before applying glue to improve the strength of the bond.
 With the tape still attached, roll the walls up so that the 45° angles fit into each other. If it was measured correctly, the bottom piece should fit snugly into the wall pieces. Clamp the sides and let the glue set.
 You can create a simple lid by measuring a piece of wood that extends an out beyond the edge of the box. Glue small pieces of wood around the edge of the new piece to keep the lid from falling off.
 You can sand the edges down if you’d like them to be more curved. Paint the box to your liking.

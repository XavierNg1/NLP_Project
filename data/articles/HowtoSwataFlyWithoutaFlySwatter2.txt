 Use a spatula just like you would a regular fly swatter to catch a fly between it and a flat surface. Move close to the fly slowly, then move the spatula quickly so the flat part of it hits the stationary fly.


Choose a slotted spatula or one with small holes if possible. This will cause less air resistance and make the change in air pressure less easy to detect by the fly.Remember to wash the spatula with dish soap and water after you’ve used it to swat flies and before you use it for food.
 Swing at the fly with a heavy object, which will help propel the swatting motion with its weight. Try a shoe, a book, or a similarly solid object.


Choose something that is small enough and easy enough for you to swing with one or two hands. As always, you want to move slowly to position yourself close to the fly, then move in one very fast motion to swat with your object.
Many people like to use a rolled-up newspaper or magazine to swat flies with, as the paper becomes sturdier when rolled but remains light enough to swing quickly and easily. Just make sure it doesn’t come unrolled and that you aim carefully when using this method.
 Pull at opposite corners of a dish cloth, rag, or small towel with two hands. Then release one hand as you bring the towel down in a swinging motion to hit the fly with it.Dampen the towel with water to make it heavier and more likely to hit the fly with force.
Make sure to use a small hand towel size of fabric that you can easily swing at the fly. A larger towel will be too unwieldy and not reach the fly with as much force.

 You should see your background image and the variety of files you have on your desktop.


On an Apple computer the application "Finder" will be running when you are on your desktop.An icon for it should be located in your tool bar but it should be the default application going when you turn on your computer.
 This will pop up a list of actions you can choose from.Once you right click you can release your fingers. The list of options should remain visible until you click another time, either to pick one of the options or to get rid of the list, in which case you would simply click anywhere else on the screen.
 This will create a new folder on the desktop of your computer.


If the list includes "New," you may have to make a second choice from another list that pops up. If that is the case, the second list that pops up should have an option to create a "Folder."Click on this option.
 Once you have created this new folder you can name it anything you like. Right click on the folder icon and a list should come up. On this list should be the option to "rename" your folder.Click on that option and you will be allowed to input a new name with your keyboard.
 Move your files by simply clicking and then dragging any file icon, while holding your finger down and not lifting it. To put a file into your folder just drag the file until it hovers over the folder and then lift your finger, letting go of the click. The computer should put your file into the folder you created.

 If you have one or more vegan guests attending the wedding reception, you can accommodate them by serving a fully vegan entree—or at least a few vegan hors d’oeuvres. Coordinate this with your caterer or the individuals preparing the food for the wedding. Pasta and vegetable dishes are common vegan options at wedding receptions.When eating large, catered meals, vegans often get stuck having to eat salad or a bland plate of vegetables in place of a full meal. If you serve a vegan entrée, vegans will be able to have a more interesting meal.
 If you’re concerned that caterers won’t take seriously the request to have vegan food served, you can tell them that guests have dairy or egg allergies. Catering companies will take these statements more seriously.You could suggest that, in order to accommodate these alleged allergies, caterers make an entrée using ingredients tofu and almond milk.
If you’re serving coffee, plan to serve either soy, rice, or almond milk in addition to regular dairy milk for guests to add to their coffee.
 As when accommodating other dietary restrictions, if you’re serving food buffet-style, you’ll need a way to inform your vegan guests which dishes they can consume. Do this by printing out small cards that read “Vegetarian” or “Vegan,” respectively. This will save guests from confusion, and save you from having to answer many redundant questions concerning which dishes are or are not vegan.If members of the catering staff will be manning the buffet table, make sure that they also know which dishes are gluten free.
If the catering wait staff are bringing the plates directly to seated guests, the staff should have a full list of which guests require a vegan meal.

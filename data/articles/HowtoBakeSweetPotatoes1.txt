 Here's what you'll need to make simple baked sweet potatoes:


One or more sweet potatoes
Butter
Salt
Optional toppings such as maple syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger;
, Wash the sweet potatoes and dry them thoroughly. Use a fork to poke holes on the top of the potatoes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 Place the sweet potatoes directly on the rack in your oven, or on a baking sheet if you prefer. Bake for about 45 minutes, or until they feel soft inside when you poke them with a fork. Remove them from the oven and allow them to cool.
 Use a knife to cut a slit along the top of the sweet potatoes. Dress them with butter and a sprinkle of salt, and serve warm.









For an extra sweet dish, add a few teaspoons of maple syrup or brown sugar. Cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and other warm spices are also delicious sweet potato toppings.
Leftover baked sweet potatoes make an excellent breakfast, since their flavor grows more intense over the course of the night. Store them in a covered dish in the refrigerator overnight, and eat them cold or reheated the next morning with the toppings you prefer.

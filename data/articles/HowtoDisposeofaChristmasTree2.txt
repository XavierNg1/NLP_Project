 Secure your tree in your backyard for birds and other creatures to use as a feeding spot.Your leftover Christmas tree could also provide small animals with shelter.


After some months, the tree will be bare and brittle enough to be chopped up in a wood chipper, where the pieces can later be used for mulch., Some forest preserves accept Christmas trees after the holidays. Donated trees are sometimes used for mulch around natural areas, planted for artificial habitat, or used in bodies of water as fish structures.Since most of the bodies of water and lakes in forest preserves are man made, fish donâ€™t have structures to hide from predators at the bottom of the lake.The Christmas trees at the bottom of the lake help diversify the aquatic ecosystems within the forest preserve.
 Cut off some of the more hydrated branches of the tree, and bind them into a wreath that can be hung on your door, used as a winter centerpiece, or wrapped around the bottom of candles.If you have an essential oil extractor, you can try to extract the oils and scents from the pine needles to make a wintery air freshener.

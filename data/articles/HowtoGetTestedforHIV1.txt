 If you have flu-like symptoms that last for a week or 2, and you don't recall being exposed to the influenza virus, you may have HIV. If you suspect your symptoms are from HIV, see your doctor.


Not everyone infected with HIV exhibits symptoms; some people infected with the virus may not exhibit symptoms for several years after exposure.;
, Certain behaviors increased your chances of being exposed to HIV. People who have injected drugs with needles shared with other drug users or who have unprotected sex with multiple partners or partners who themselves have had unprotected sex with other partners are at risk. Also at risk are people diagnosed with or treated for sexually transmitted diseases, hepatitis or tuberculosis, as well as those who've had unprotected sex with someone so diagnosed.


If you've had unprotected sex, both you and your partner should get tested.
You cannot get HIV just from being around someone who has it, nor can you get it from someone else's sweat, saliva or tears or by sharing a closed-mouth kiss. Insect bites or stings do not transmit HIV, nor can you get it from donating blood, as the needles used for blood donations are not reused.
 Drugs are available to prevent a pregnant woman from passing HIV to her baby, but these drugs will be used only if doctors know the woman has HIV. If you want to have children, and you either have symptoms or have put yourself at risk, you need to get tested for HIV.

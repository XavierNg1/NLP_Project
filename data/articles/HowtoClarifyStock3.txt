 Straining your stock is important in all methods of clarification.
 Sticking your stock into the refrigerator or freezer could potentially create bacteria. Instead, fill a bowl or your sink up with ice cubes, and place your pot, with the lid into the bed of ice. Stir the stock every 2-3 minutes until it is chilled.


Food that stays at 40°F(4°C) to 140°F(60° C) for more than two hours could be potentially dangerous to eat., Leaving your stock in the refrigerator for a couple of hours, or overnight, will allow all the excess fat to rise to the top and harden.There should be a thick layer of fat on the surface of your stock, even if you’ve already strained it.
 You can use a spoon or other utensil to carefully peel away the top layer of hardened fat. After you are done, you should be left with a flavorful, clear stock.You can use the leftover fat as lard in other recipes.

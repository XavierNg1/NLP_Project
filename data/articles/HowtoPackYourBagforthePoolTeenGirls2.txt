 Even if you apply it before you get to the pool, you will need to reapply if you are at the pool for a long time.
 Get big, wraparound shades to protect your eyes from UVA and UVB rays.
 Some main things you will need are:



Aloe Vera Gel. This is a must-have! Not only is it soothing to a bad case of sunburned skin, it promotes healing to the affected skin area too. This product is also made up of a light and non-greasy formula, which makes it much more easier to apply.

Petroleum Jelly. It's the miracle drug to anything chapped! Being in the sun can really dry out your skin and lips. Although cracked lips may not be fatal, they sure feel like it!

Waterproof Plasters. Don't forget to pack the waterproof ones, so that they can keep bruises and cuts dry.

Insect Repellent. If you've got sensitive skin, a small bite can end up being a big problem. This keeps mosquitoes, flies and other irritants away.

Eye and Ear Drops. It can relieve irritation as well as prevent possible infections such as 'swimmers ears' which is a result of sea water, sand and debris.

 Before you can clean the plates completely, you must remove excess food from them. Using a wet paper towel, wipe down the plates to remove any crumbs or chunks of food still stuck to the plate.Using a wet paper towel also helps remove any non-stick cooking spray you might have used on your grill. This is important since a layer of that cooking spray can prevent your grill from getting completely clean.;
, To make the cleaning solution, mix 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) baking soda with half cup (4 ounces) of warm water. The solution should be thick enough that it won’t just run off the grill, but thinner than a paste.Mixing this solution in a measuring cup can make it easier to pour when it’s time to clean your grill.
 Be sure that your pour it evenly, allowing the solution to run down each groove on the grill., To clean the top of the grill, dip a cloth in the baking soda solution. Wipe down each groove of the grill. You will need to reload the cloth with new solution frequently, depending on how dirty the grill is., Once you’ve applied the solution to both sides of the grill, let it sit on the grill for five to ten minutes. This will allow the baking soda to work into the residue on the grill and break it up., Dip a clean cloth in clear water and wipe down each groove of the grill. Start with the top portion of the grill, since whatever comes from that part will drip onto the bottom portion. You should continue to wipe away the baking soda until the cloth comes away clean. You can then let your grill air dry or wipe it dry with clean paper towel.

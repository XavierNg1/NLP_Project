 Yeah, just... Relax. Singing doesn't work under stress.Nerves? Those are okay, if channeled into positive energy. However, panic attacks? Not so much.
 However, this isn't meant in the way you've probably learned. There's two sets of chords or flaps in your throat- The vocal chords and these other pesky ones that like to get in the way. If you open your mouth and close your throat, your air will be cut off. Now open it- You'll probably feel a light clicking sensation and can breathe almost silently. Congrats, you've retracted! That's a new way to breathe that could just turn around the way you sing.
 Actually, as you start out, you should sound TERRIBLE. However, by making those clear sounds and practicing them, you're training your voice to make unpleasant noises with the right technique. All that's left now is what you could do with just about any teacher- Make those noises more pleasant.
 Don't overexert, but just keep practicing and singing things until you start to sound more desirable. People over-complicate singing, yet simultaneously under-complicate it. You just need to keep exploring.
 This is what causes the demise of many singers. If you feel a sharp fuzzy feeling in your throat or are feeling uncomfortable in any way, STOP! Drink some water and take a break. Also, if you're feeling balls of phlegm coming out of your system or getting lodged in your throat, cough them up rather than swallow them.

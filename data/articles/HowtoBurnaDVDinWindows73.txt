 ISO files are disc image files. These are essentially exact copies of a disc, and burning them to a DVD will make the DVD act as if it was the source of the ISO. ISO files cannot be burned as data files if you want the disc to be a copy.


Windows 7 has ISO-burning capabilities built-in.
 This will open the "Burn Disc Image" window.
 If you have more than one disc drive, make sure that the correct one is displayed in the "Disc burner" drop-down menu.
 You can choose to verify the disc after burning, but this will take extra time and there's nothing that can be done with a disc that doesn't work anyway. The burn process will likely take a few minutes, depending on the size of the ISO and the speed of your burner., Once the ISO has been burned, the disc will act as an exact copy of the source of the ISO. For example, if the ISO file is for a Linux installation disc, your burned disc will now be bootable and can be used to install Linux or run it from the disc.

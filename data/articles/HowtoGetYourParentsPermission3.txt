 Be proactive and problem-solve ahead of time. This helps show your parents that you are responsible and understand their concerns.You might know your parents are always concerned about you being home by your curfew. Let them know you’ve thought ahead to how you will ensure that won’t be a problem. For example, “If you’re worried about my ride being unreliable, I will use the Uber app on my phone to make sure I get home on time.”
If you have a friend they don’t like who is going to be at the event, you could say, “I know you don’t like me hanging out with Kyle. He’ll be at the party, but I won’t go anywhere with him.”

, Even though it might not seem like a big deal to you, it might be a big deal to your parents. Don’t expect an answer right away. After you have your discussion, give them a day to think about it before you bring it up again.


The next day, you could say, “Have you guys had a chance to think about letting me go to Peyton’s party on Saturday?”

, Just like you may talk to your friends before you make a decision, your parents might want to learn more about what you want to do from your friends’ parents or your teachers (if it is a school activity). Be patient with them, and help them connect with the other adults if you can.


Get them your friends’ parents’ phone numbers and/or email addresses if you haven’t already.
Let them know how they can contact your teacher or coach, if this is a school-related event.

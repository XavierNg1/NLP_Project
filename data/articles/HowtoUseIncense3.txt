 Fill an incense bowl with white chaff ash, and tap the bowl lightly to settle the ash. Make an indentation in the ash that is one continual line. You can make a “U” shape, a spiral, or anything else that comes to mind, as long as the indentation is a single continual line. Most importantly, the indentation should be about half an inch deep and half an inch wide.You can get white chaff ash from some stores that sell incense or online.
You can use a koh press to make an indentation, which are designed for this purpose, and were originally used to create elaborate incense trails that also doubled as a method for keeping time.
 Sandalwood powder will burn and provide an aroma of its own. Makko powder has a more neutral aroma, and you can either sprinkle loose incense on top of a burning Makko powder trail or pre-mix incense of your choice with Makko powder before filling the indentation.Slightly press the trail down once you’ve filled the indentation with the desired aromatic material.
 You can get wood stick designed to light incense, or simply use a match. Lay either at one end of the trail and leave it there to allow the trail to light. If you used plain Makko powder to fill the indentation and make your trail, sprinkle loose incense on the trail once it is bright orange or red., Remove the spent trail with a spoon and discard it, making sure it is fully extinguished. Any ash that has not been mixed with burnt material from the trail can be re-used.

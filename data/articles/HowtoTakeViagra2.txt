 The usual recommended dose is 50 mg, but in some cases your doctor may recommend taking either more or less than the average dose. Viagra pills are available in either 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg tablets.
The maximum recommended dose is 100 mg. Do not take more than this at once.
 Viagra is most effective when taken in this time frame, since it takes a little while for the medication to circulate and stimulate an erection. However, Viagra may be taken up to 4 hours before sexual activity and still be effective., Taking Viagra multiple times per day is not advised, especially if it means exceeding the recommended 100 mg dosage.
 Eating a high-fat meal may cause the Viagra to go into effect more slowly. Eat light meals throughout the day before taking Viagra, and avoid heavy meals with red meat, fried food, and other high-fat components.

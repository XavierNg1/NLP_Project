Short hip flexors and ankles that are compressed cause lower back pain and reduce leg strength. This is so important to all Equestrian Athletes, due to the Range of Movement needed about the ankle for rising or sitting trot, canter and for that matter every phase and transition.;
, This will lessen the compression in the joint.
, The exercises are designed to be worked in the home environment but as with all things in life, you only get back what you put in. As the workouts are shorter, this enables the rider to make the most of the time allocated to their training session and psychologically it becomes both more manageable and achievable. This is in turn creates an increased feeling of self-control and the ability to focus on the positives rather than the negatives. ‘Sticking to it’ and not being distracted will yield phenomenal results.

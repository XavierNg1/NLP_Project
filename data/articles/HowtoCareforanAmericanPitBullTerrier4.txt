 To reduce shedding and to keep their coat shiny, you should brush your pit bull terrierâ€™s coat several times a week. Use a rubber curry brush for the best results. This will remove excess fur and dead skin cells.When your dog is shedding, typically in late spring and early fall, brushing them daily will keep their coat looking its best.
 The breed has an easy coat to care for and is not prone to skin problems. They do not need frequent baths. You should wash them when they are muddy or dirty. Use a shampoo made for dogs, not humans., If your pit bull terrier keeps scratching their ears or if there is visible discharge around the ears, you may need to clean them. Check the ears for a build-up of earwax. Add a few drops of dog ear cleaning solution, and massage the ear. Use a cotton ball to wipe up any solution or wax from the ear.This should not be painful. If your dog is upset, whining, or in pain, call your vet. It might be an ear infection.
Some dogs do not like to have their ears touched. If your pit bull is a puppy, you can get them used to having their ears cleaned by touching their ears often. If you have an older pit bull who was not socialized as a puppy, you may want to ask your vet to clean their ears for you.

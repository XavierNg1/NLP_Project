 Though you want to create high resting spots for your cat in your home, there may be places that you do not want your cat to rest on. For example, maybe you have a shelf of collectibles you want to keep your cat away from or you have an antique bureau that you’d rather not have your cat rest on. To deter your cat from resting in these spots, try putting double sided tape on them.If you are worried the double sided tape will ruin furniture, try putting the tape on a piece of cardboard and then placing the cardboard on the item. This way, your cat is deterred from resting or climbing on the item and the item’s surface does not get damaged.
 You can also deter your kitty from resting on inappropriate spots by placing shallow dishes of water by these areas. Cats usually don’t like being close to water or stepping in water. The dishes of water can prevent them from climbing or resting on spots you want to keep cat-free.You can also try spraying your cat lightly with a spray bottle when they are on surfaces you don’t want them to be on. However, only do so lightly and intermittently. Over time, your cat will likely learn not to go on spots where they are going to get sprayed.
 Try to encourage your cat to climb or rest on their climbing post instead of inappropriate spots in your home. Place treats on their climbing post so they go to there instead. Pet your cat when they are on their climbing post so they know it is a good spot to be.

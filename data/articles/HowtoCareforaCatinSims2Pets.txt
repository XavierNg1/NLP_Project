 How else can you do anything? You can either make a new family with a cat, or adopt a cat with an existing family. Just note that if you adopt, you cannot pick the colour, breed or personality.;
, Here is a list of everything you need: Food bowl, Cat bed, Litter tray and toys. Also, get a scratching post. If you don't have one they will probably ruin all your Sims furniture.
 It costs, but not much. If you have a glitch like I do where then they are hungry they won't go to the food bowl, you will have to go into buy mode, drag the bowl over and click play. When they finish, you have to go into buy mode.... you get the idea. Just repeat it.
 Unless you want messes everywhere in your Sims house, toilet train them!

, You will form a relationship with them and it will always last for the cat and the Sims life.

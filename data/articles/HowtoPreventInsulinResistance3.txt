 BMIs calculate your weight relative to your height. Charts can be found online and used to determine if you are overweight or obese, which could lead to insulin resistance or pre-diabetes. BMI charts are simple to read. Find your height in 1 column and your weight in another. The chart will give you a BMI number. If the chart indicates you are overweight or obese, consult your physician for a diet an exercise program. Losing as little as 10 lbs. (4.54 kilograms) can help prevent insulin resistance.

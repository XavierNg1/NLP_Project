 You will need an aluminum beverage can, scissors, water, ice and a thermometer to complete this method of measuring dew point. For a larger experiment you can use a bucket. Use a larger bucket if you plan to demonstrate this experiment in front of a larger audience.


You might also benefit from having a pencil and paper to record your results.;
, If you are using a can of soda, you’ll need to cut off the top portion of the lid. For a clean cut, use a can opener. Be gentle and take your time or else you may have sharp aluminum protruding out.
 Check a weather source to see if they call for clouds. If the air temperature is higher than the dew point, you won’t be able to see the clouds.You may have better results if there are clouds on the day of your experiment. The ideal day is a cool, but not too cold of a day when the clouds are present.


Aim for sixty degree weather. You can still proceed with your experiment if the weather is colder or warmer.
Look up the dew point temperature of your area to test your experiment.
 Relocate to an environment in which you wish to measure the current dew point; i.e. a particular interior or exterior area of your home or office. The temperature where you conduct the experiment should be well above freezing.


You’ll need to add salt to your experiment if your location is below freezing.

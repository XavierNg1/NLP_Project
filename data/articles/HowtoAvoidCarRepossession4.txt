 When you file for bankruptcy, you provide the court with a list of all creditors. These creditors are then sent a notice by the bankruptcy court telling them to stop all collection efforts. If the creditor continues collection, then it will face heavy fines. This notice is called the “automatic stay.”


You can stop a repossession by filing for bankruptcy.The automatic stay will then stop the lender from repossessing the vehicle.
Nevertheless, you should understand that once you emerge from bankruptcy the repossession can start up again unless you discharged the underlying car loan during the bankruptcy proceedings.
 Filing for bankruptcy is a big step. It can have a far-reaching impact on your credit score and other areas of life. You should meet with a lawyer to discuss whether or not bankruptcy is a good option for you.


You can find a bankruptcy lawyer by visiting your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program.You are strongly encouraged to use a lawyer to file for bankruptcy. People represented by lawyers have greater odds of completing bankrupt successfully than those who proceed without a lawyer.
 If you decide to go through with filing for bankruptcy, then you should give your attorney a list of creditors. Be sure that the lender is included in the list.


If, after filing, your car is repossessed, then tell your lawyer. You can bring suit against the lender for continuing collection efforts after the automatic stay has been issued.

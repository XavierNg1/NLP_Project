 Carrying extra weight on your truck consumes more fuel. The truck itself is already heavy compared to regular cars, so get rid of unnecessary junk.
 The owner's manual specifies what kind of fuel and octane level should be used on the car. A higher octane level doesn’t improve fuel mileage. Using the correct octane fuel on your vehicle is proven to make it run smoother and lowers the chance of engine knocking. If you really want to save money on gas, you can research on what gas stations offer lower fuel prices.
 Keep them properly inflated and in the recommended air pressure. A vehicle with under-inflated tires consumes more fuel. The correct tire pressure is specified in the owner’s manual as well as the driver’s side door.
 Washing and waxing your truck allows air to glide smoothly while the vehicle is in motion. If you have a roof rack or truck rack installed, have it removed, for it slows down the vehicle because of wind resistance. Close the windows while speeding because it causes air drag as well.

 Note: This Radio Cable will have two connections on one end. One connection will go to the back of the radio (data/PWR); the other end will go to the large Motorcycle Battery when using the option 2 cable.



The setting for the ports will need to be changed on the data collector when using the nine pin port 2 cable.

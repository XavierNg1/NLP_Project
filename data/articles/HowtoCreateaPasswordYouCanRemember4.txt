, This is similar to doing a bridge shuffling with cards.


For example, say your word is kitty and your number is your ZIP code, 56789. Just start with the letters and reverse the number, placing them alternately. Thus, k9i8t7t6y5.
Alternatively, you can make the first letter a capital for greater security.
You don’t really need to have the letters and numbers the same length; you can just have the letters or numbers in sequence at the end. For example, a shorter number (like your area code or birth year) might look like this, K8i1t8ty or a shorter word like your name “Bob” would look like B9o8b765.

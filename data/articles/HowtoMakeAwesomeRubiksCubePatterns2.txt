 You need to start with your cube in the solved position to make a checkerboard pattern. Also known as a chessboard, your Rubik’s cube will have a checkered pattern on each side when you are done.
 Begin by looking at the green side of your cube. Turn the right side of the cube two clicks forward. The three green squares should end up on the opposite side of the cube. Then, still facing the green side take the left side of the cube and turn it two clicks forward as well.
 Keep the green center cube facing you. Then, turn the top row clockwise by 180 degrees (two clicks). Turn the bottom row 180 degrees as well., With the green center block still facing you, turn the front face of your cube by 180 degrees (two clicks), as if you are turning a dial. Turn the back side of your cube by 180 degrees as well. You’ve now created a checkerboard on all sides of your cube.

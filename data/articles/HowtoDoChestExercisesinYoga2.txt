 The name of this exercise has nothing to do with its execution; simply sit down with one leg over the other and reach your arm up towards the ceiling to effectively lengthen the muscles in your back. Make sure you focus on finding a center of balance in your chest, not your back, to maximize chest strengthening.
 You might find this one challenging, particularly if you have poor balance, but after completing this workout a few times you'll be able to do it perfectly. This pose is also called "awkward pose" because it can be a difficult stretch, but by elongating your arms, you can find your center of balance easily. Complete this pose three times: once with your feet planted firmly on the ground, once with your heels just slightly off the ground, and once with your heels elevated 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2Â cm) off the ground.
 Another balance-dependent pose, this one will relieve anxiety and increase lung capacity. If you struggle to keep your balance, remember to keep pushing your foot into the palm of your hand. The more you push, the better you will be able to keep poised and also the better the stretch. While the goal of this pose is to lift your toes above your head, if this complete stretch is not in your practice, just elevate your foot as much as possible, focusing on keeping a continuous arch.

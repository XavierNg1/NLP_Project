 Orthokeratology is most often used to correct myopia (nearsightedness) in adults, so if you suffer from myopia, Ortho-k lenses may be the best solution.Ortho-k lenses are also effective at treating astigmatism and hyperopia.


Astigmatism occurs when your eyes fail to properly focus refracted light on the retina.Hyperopia is the medical term for farsightedness., Although Ortho-k lenses only provide a temporary solution to myopia or astigmatism and need to be worn nightly (or every other night), they are much less expensive than laser refractive surgery (such as LASIK), and may have comparable results.Unlike eye surgery, the results of orthokeratology are temporary and reversible.
Ortho-k treatment is painless and does not have any recovery period.
Children can use Ortho-k lenses, while surgery is only available to individuals over 18.
If you’d like to try Ortho-k lenses, your optometrist may ask you to complete a trial period with the Ortho-k lenses before giving you a full prescription. This will generally comprise a 1–2 week trial., Ortho-k lenses can be very effective. for children in the age range from 8–12 who suffer from progressive myopia (worsening nearsightedness). For children, not only can Ortho-k lenses improve daytime vision (as for adults), but the lenses can also prevent or slow the development of adulthood myopia.If you suspect your child is myopic, have them examined by an optometrist.

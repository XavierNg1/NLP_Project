 The basic principle is this: If you play a song from genre x and the dance floor fills, then you play a song from genre y and the dance floor empties you know that to keep the dance floor packed you need to play more of x than y.


This concept is important! Watch your dance floor! Many DJs fail to impress the crowd because they fail to notice when they clear the dance floor for long periods of time and they don't know what type of music will bring the people back when they finally do notice.
It is also essential to also take note of the type of crowd you are dealing with! Students, parents and/or grown-ups!

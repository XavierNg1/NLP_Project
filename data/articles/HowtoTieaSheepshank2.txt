 Twist a flat piece of rope by bringing one end up and the other down. The rope forms two curves called bights between the flat middle section and the upper and lower ends that point in opposite directions.The middle part is the section that has no tension. If your rope is damaged, keep the damaged part in the middle.
 Take one end of the rope. Twist it backwards and over itself to form a loop. Repeat with the opposite end. The rope will still resemble an S except the ends are coiled.
 Pick up the curved part of the S, the bight. Hold the nearest loop still with your other hand and move the bight under and through it. Repeat with the other end. Youâ€™ll have rope crossing at both ends, leaving the loops sticking out like handles.
 Grasp one of the loops in each hand. Pull them in opposite directions away from your body until the loop is as tight as desired.

 The whelping box will serve as a safe place or “den” for your dog to deliver her puppies. It consists of a soft bed area surrounded by relatively high walls. You can make one out of plywood or firm plastic, or you can buy a commercially available box.


The whelping box needs to be large enough to allow your dog to fully stretch out and still leave room for all of the puppies.
The walls of the box need to be high enough to prevent the puppies from climbing out when they are 6 weeks old, but short enough that their mother can leave as she desires.
The walls need to be firm and secure enough that they will not collapse and squish the puppies.
If you don’t provide a box, your dog may choose a less-than-desirable location on her own.
 Line the bottom of the box with towels. Replace and wash the towels frequently after the puppies arrive. Both delivery and the puppies can make a mess, so plan accordingly.


Lining the box with newspaper is not recommended because it is neither soft nor warm, and newspaper ink can transfer to the puppies’ fur.
Keep the floor of the box is around 75°F by using low wattage light bulbs. For your dog’s and the puppies’ safety, make sure that the floor doesn’t get too hot or too cold.
 You will need to access the site frequently to assist your dog, but it should be tucked away from distractions and other pets. Allow your dog access to her whelping box for at least 1-2 weeks before she delivers. This will help her become comfortable with box when it is time to have the puppies.

 Flavor shots are sweetened and flavored syrups that you can add to coffees and other drinks. They come in a variety of flavors, and you can buy them at grocery stores and some cafes. Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of syrup to each demitasse after you pull the espresso shot.Popular shots to add to macchiatos include vanilla, caramel, and chocolate.
 Macchiatos are not traditionally served with whipped cream, but you can still garnish your drink with a little whip if you like. After adding any flavor shots and pouring the milk, spoon or spray a small dollop of whipped cream on top of the beverage., Grated chocolate is a delicious way to finish an espresso beverage, especially if youâ€™ve got some whipped cream on top already. When your macchiato is ready, shave a block of chocolate shavings directly onto the milk or whipped cream.

You can use dark, milk, or white chocolate to garnish your drink.
 Another way to change the flavor of your macchiato is to add a dash of ground cinnamon to the top after the milk has been poured.If you're getting your macchiato with whipped cream, sprinkle the cinnamon on last.

Other spices you can try with your macchiato include nutmeg, ginger, and cardamom.

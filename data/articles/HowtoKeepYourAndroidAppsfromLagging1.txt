 When trying to save space, it is important that the device has as much free space available as possible in order to be able to effectively process the information. Old apps that are installed but seldom used can clog up the space unnecessarily, so the simple answer is to remove the old apps. To get started, open the application drawer from the main Android home screen.


In the application drawer, you’ll see all the apps that you’ve installed on your Android device.;
, There should be three dots in the upper right-hand corner of the screen––tap these to open the context menu.


If there are no dots, tap the physical menu button on the device.
 Tap to select.
 There should now be a white “X” within a small red dot next to the application that can be uninstalled from the device. Tap the “X” and a little pop-up box that says “Uninstall” in the lower left-hand corner will appear. Tap “Uninstall” to continue.


Another pop-up will appear asking you to confirm the uninstallation. Tap “Yes” to proceed with uninstalling the app.

 One of the quickest ways to troubleshoot a corrupted presentation is to try to import them into a blank presentation. You may be able to save some or all of the slides. Start by opening PowerPoint without loading a file.
 When prompted to select the type of file you want to create or load, select the blank presentation option.
 You'll find this towards the left end of the Home tab. Make sure to click the â–¼ part of the button so that the menu appears.
 This will open a sidebar on the right side of the screen.
 This will open the file browser.
 Use the file browser to navigate to the file and select it. Click "Open" to open the file.If PowerPoint is able to extract the slides from the corrupted file, you'll see them appear in a preview window.
 This will import all of the slides from the corrupted file into your blank presentation.
 If the slides were able to import properly, you'll be able to run the presentation and see all of the slides. PowerPoint may not have been able to recover all of the slides from the corrupted file.
 If the slides don't look like they should after you've added them to your blank presentation, you may be able to fix it by loading the corrupted presentation as a theme template:


Click the File menu or Office button and select "Save As." Save a copy of your recovered presentation with a different name as a backup.
Open the Design tab, click "More" in the "Themes" section, and then click the "Browse For Themes" link.
Select your damaged presentation file and click "OK." This will load the slide master from your damaged presentation, which will restore the theme.
Switch back to your backup copy of the recovered presentation if it stops

, After confirming that the slides have imported properly, you can save your new presentation file. You should be able to load the new without any corruption problems.To be extra safe, save it to a different location than the original corrupted file was stored.

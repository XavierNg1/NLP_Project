 You'll have the easiest time removing the plastic part of the case if you work from the top of the device.
 You may have to lift a bit to get the plastic over any Power buttons. When you lift the plastic top off, the rest of the case should come off easily.
 Starting from the corner is the easiest way to begin removing the rubber. The seal will be tight, so you'll need to push with some force.
 Work your way around the case to remove the rubber. Be careful with the ports, as the rubber port covers can tear easily.

 Whatever cookware you use should be spacious enough to reheat however much chili you plan on cooking with. Spray slow cookers and nonstick pots and saucepans with cooking spray to keep the reheated chili from sticking when it gets hot.


For smaller servings, you can also microwave a single bowl at a time.
Only use as much chili as you need to make a given dish—refrigerating and reheating chili multiple times will cause it to lose its freshness faster.;
, Chili thickens as it loses moisture in the refrigerator, so a splash of liquid will help return it to its original consistency. Be careful not to add too much liquid, or you could inadvertently make it soupy. Stir the liquid into the chili thoroughly before you begin heating it.Using tomato sauce or savory chicken stock as opposed to water will keep from diluting the rich flavor of the chili.
If you prefer your chili extra thick, skip this step and reheat as usual.
 Turn on the cooktop to medium-high heat. Keep an eye on the chili as it warms up, stirring once every few minutes. When it begins the bubble continually around the edges, it’s ready to serve.Stir the chili from the bottom of the pot to better distribute heat.
The chili will be ready to eat when it’s warm, but you can also leave it to simmer for about half an hour more to revitalize the individual flavors., Once your chili has been warmed through, ladle up a big bowl and savor it for a second time. This is the simplest way to get more enjoyment out of a batch. Chili keeps well in the refrigerator, so you can keep using it until the last of it is gone.


Garnish a bowl of chili with tasty add-ons like cheese, sliced scallions, sour cream or corn chips.

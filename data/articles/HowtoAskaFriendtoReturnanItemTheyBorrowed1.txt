 Be bold and come out with your request. Even if they’ve had it a long time, just assume they have intended to return it, and say, "I’d like to get my copy of X-Men back when we meet next." With that direct approach, embarrassment or common courtesy will likely cause them to return your item., By inquiring about the item you’ll be less confrontational. It suggests uncertainty, and allows your friend to be confident in their reply, as if they were the one who decided to return the item. Try a few of the following approaches:


"Are you done with my copy of Twilight? I’d like to have it back when you’re done."
”Hey, I’m looking for my hat, do you still have it?”
”Would you mind giving the video game back to me?”

, A message allows you to be direct without having to confront your friend. It’s easily less personal.There is possible misinterpretation, so be careful with your wording.


Facebook allows you a great way to send a message. Send a private message with just enough information to let your friend know you’d like the item back.
Shoot your friend a quick email. Nothing extravagant is needed. Just ask for your item back.
Text your friend. Ask for the item and include their favorite emoticon to make it less harsh.
 Whenever you talk to your friend, bring it up. No matter the conversation, steer everything back to the loaned item. Your friend will quickly get the hint.

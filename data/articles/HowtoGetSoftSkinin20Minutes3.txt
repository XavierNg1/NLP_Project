 Some people have luck with putting olive oil on their skin about 30 minutes before they hop in the shower. Shower as you normally would. After you shower, apply a thin layer of olive oil under your moisturizer.


You can also use olive oil to create your own physical exfoliant. Mix one part of olive oil to one part of brown sugar. Scrub it in as you would other exfoliants, by going in circles all over your body. Jump in the shower to rinse it off.
 In a pan, melt one part beeswax. Mix it together with equal parts of olive oil and unprocessed honey. Once it's cool, rub it on your skin. After about 10 minutes, take a shower to rinse it off.
 After you get out of a shower, try using a thin layer of coconut oil. Rub it in as you would lotion. Continue to massage until it disappears.

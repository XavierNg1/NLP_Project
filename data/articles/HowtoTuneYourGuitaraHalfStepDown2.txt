 Make sure that you are in standard tuning. You'll tune down a half step to whatever you are currently tuned to if not., Play the 4th fret on the low "E" string. This is an Ab. Tune the "A" string down until it sounds the same as the "E" on the 4th fret. The "A" is now an "Ab".
 Play the 7th fret on the A string. This note is an Eb. Play the E string open and the A string on the seventh fret. Tune up the low E until the sound matches the A string on the seventh fret.
 After tuning the low E and A strings, tune like you would normally. Follow this order:


Tune the 4th string to the 5th fret of the 5th string.
Tune the 3rd string to the 5th fret of the 4th string.
Tune the 2nd string to the 4th fret of the 3rd string.
Tune the 1st string to the 5th fret of the 2nd string.
 If you have the means, use an app or website that has a tuner and check your tuning. Tuning your guitar down a half step changes your guitar neck's tension. It'll need time to settle before holding a new tuning.

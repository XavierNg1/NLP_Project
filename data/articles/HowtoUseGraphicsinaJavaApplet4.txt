 Here is the code for making an Image object. Instead of typing "getCodeBase()", you can also replace it with a URL. If your picture file is inside a folder, you can also type that folder with the name.
 The arguments to the method should be, in order, the image object name, the x coordinate, the y coordinate, the width, the height, and "this". Here is the code snippet:


The image's top left corner will be at (300,200). Its width will be 60 pixels, and its height will be 120 pixels.

 This option is less likely to occur during your first house-flipping experience, but it is worth a shot. If you have good credit and a solid business plan, your bank might be able to provide you with a loan to purchase a house to flip. These interest rates will likely be higher than a typical mortgage with a 20% down payment, but they will likely be lower than many hard money loans.A bank is more likely to lend construction funds if you can provide a clear lien on the property.
 If you have any hope of securing a bank loan, you will require a rock-solid business plan. Be sure to discuss your research with your bank to see if they consider you a worthwhile investment.

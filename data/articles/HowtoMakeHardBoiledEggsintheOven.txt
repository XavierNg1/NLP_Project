 If your oven is a little on the weak side or if you're baking a dozen large ones, you might want to vamp it up to 350ºF (177ºC).

, If you have a mini muffin tin, even better. They won't roll around as much.









If you're not using the entirety of the pan, put the eggs in the center. When the weight of the tin is balanced, it's easier to maneuver.
 Go watch an episode of your favorite TV show, read a chapter of that book you've been meaning to finish, or, heck, jog around the block. Your work here is done. And who said you couldn't cook?









When you bake eggs, the shells get little brown dots. This is totally fine! When you soak them in water the brown spots should all disappear.
 This keeps the eggs from cooking more and turning that nasty shade of green around the yolk. It'll also speed up the time you'll spend waiting for them to cool down and peel them.
 They'll be very hot -- use tongs to avoid burning your fingers. Let them sit in the cold water for 10 minutes.
 Their peels should just about slide right off. You'll never boil eggs again. Eat them whole, make 'em deviled, turn them into a salad, and save the rest for later.









Keep this in mind for when Easter comes around! Baking batches of eggs for dying is completely stress-free this way.

 Unlike most knots, the Pratt knot begins with the tie upside down, so the seam of the tie is facing forward. Hang the wide end of the tie over your right side, and the narrow end over your left side.


This medium size knot suits most collars and builds., In a knotted tie, the wide end should just graze the top of your belt buckle.At the start, however, raise or lower the wide end until it hangs 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) below this point. As a rule of thumb, the Pratt knot will lift the wide end by this distance as you tie the knot.The narrow end of the tie should be higher than the wide end. It will usually be around belly button level, but this is less important than the wide end's placement., Move the wide end across your body to the left side, placing it underneath the narrow end.









Do not move the narrow end of the tie for any part of this knot.Just hold it steady while you use the wide end.
 Place the tip on top of the loop, still on your left side.
 Insert the wide end down into the loop from above. Pull it through in the same direction it lay before, on the left.
 This flips the wide end so the seam is no longer visible. The wide end will extend at an angle off to your right.
 Bring the wide end up to your neck loop again, but this time from below. Pull it through.
 Your last fold created a horizontal loop at the front of your tie. Tuck the wide end through this loop, and pull straight down to tighten. The wide end should now rest in front of the narrow end.
 Pull down on the wide end to tighten. Slide the front knot up to the base of your collar to fasten the tie.









To create a dimple just below the front knot, squeeze the sides of the knot gently as you tighten.

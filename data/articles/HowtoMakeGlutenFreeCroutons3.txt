 Turn the oven on to 250 degrees F (120 C). Get out 1 loaf of gluten-free sandwich bread. Use a serrated knife to cut the bread into large cubes. Put the bread cubes into a large mixing bowl.You'll need about 4 cups (140 g) of bread cubes from the loaf.
 Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of olive oil over the bread cubes and stir them well so the cubes are coated. Stir in 1/2 cup (50 g) of grated parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons of dried herbs, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon of black pepper.Consider using a mix of dried herbs (like oregano, parsley, thyme, rosemary, or poultry seasoning).
 Spread the seasoned bread cubes on the prepared baking sheet so the cubes are in a single layer. Put the sheet in the oven and bake the croutons for 45 to 60 minutes. You may want to stir the croutons once or twice if they look like they're browning quickly. Remove the croutons and let them cool before you use them.You can store the cooled croutons in an airtight container for 5 to 6 days. Keep in mind that they'll become harder the longer you store them.

 Write down whether you can sing, what type of songs are you most able to sing well, whether classical, disco, western e.t.c. Knowing what you can do and improving it brings about a lot of chances.;
, If you are unsure about whether you can sing well or not, there is no wrong in asking close people e.g your parents, siblings, close and best friends etc. Sing in front of them or record a video of you singing if you are shy to sing in front of them.
 If you are not so good at it, then try working harder and keep practicing. Practice leads to the best result, if you keep practicing, your abilities to sing keep improving. if you can, try doing some audition of some reality singing shows like, "Indian Idol", "Sa Re Ga Ma Pa", etc.
 If you are not selected, don't get upset, try harder next time!

, then you can have some chances of becoming a playback singer in Mumbai!

 Let's say you're working with the following equation: (x + 3)/2 = (x + 1)/4. Multiply (x + 3) by 4 to get 4(x +3). Distribute the 4 to get 4x + 12.
 Repeat the process on the other side. (x +1) x 2 = 2(x +1). Distribute the 2 and you get 2x + 2.
 Now, you'll have 4x + 12 = 2x + 2. Combine the x terms and the constant terms on opposite sides of the equation.


So, combine 4x and 2x by subtracting 2x from both sides. Subtracting 2x from 2x on the right side will leave you with 0. On the left side, 4x - 2x = 2x, so you have 2x remaining.
Now, combine 12 and 2 by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation. Subtract 12 from 12 on the left and you'll have 0, and subtract 12 from 2 on the right side to get 2-12 = -10.
You're left with 2x = -10.
 All you have to do is divide both sides of the equation by 2. 2x/2 = -10/2 = x = -5. After cross multiplying, you have found that x = -5. You can go back and check your work by plugging in -5 for x to make sure that both sides of the equation are equal. They are. If you plug -5 back in to the original equation, you'll get -1 = -1.

,, Use one that is big enough to submerge the dirty parts (or most of your sieve).



Keep in mind to not to use any cleaning agents in the boiling water, as they may ruin the pot or react unexpectedly to heating. Boiling water is enough to sterilize most metals, so just ordinary water will do.
 Take care not to put any plastic parts into the water and be careful not to get scalded.
 Let sit until all traces of food are separated from the sieve.
 Full metal sieves might get quite hot, so handle with care.

 Straightening shampoos and conditioners are formulated to loosen curls. Shop at beauty supply stores and hair salons for the best products, or ask a salon expert to assist you.


Read the ingredients listed in the shampoo and conditioner that you purchase. Make sure alcohol is not one of the primary ingredients, since it will dry out your hair and make straightening more difficult.
Consider purchasing a straightening serum or leave-in conditioner to help with straightening your hair follicles.;
, Leave the conditioner in your hair for 15 to 45 minutes, depending on the relative moisture level of your hair beforehand. Rinse the conditioner out and towel dry your hair to remove excess moisture.
 This protects the hair follicles during the blow-drying process and adds shine to your hair. Comb the product through your hair to evenly coat it with the protective serum.
 Section your hair into manageable parts, working from back to front and not moving on until one section is sufficiently smooth. Blow dry your hair from root to tip, using a boar-bristle or solid plastic brush to brush it out along the way.
 When your hair is completely dry, brush it evenly and use your hands to smooth in a light styling product, or mousse for hold.

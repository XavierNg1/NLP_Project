Then, fold down one corner of the blanket.
Next, lay your newborn on the blanket so that her head is resting on the folded corner.
Pull up one side of the blanket and fold it over your newborn’s chest.
Next, fold the bottom of the blanket up and over your newborn’s feet and tuck it up and over your newborn’s shoulder.
Finally, fold the other side of the blanket over your newborn’s chest. When you are done, the swaddling should be snug, but not tight.

 These are held twice weekly, usually start between 7:00 and 7:30 pm, and last for about 2 hours. Consult your local detachment website for more specific details.Wear casual but smart-looking clothes, a good pair of boots, and tie back long hair. Expect physical activity from the start.
There will likely be multiple "parades" where information and instructions will be given, separated by times spent at different activities like shooting, drilling, compass-reading, and so on. Senior and junior cadets may be separated at times, and perhaps divided into smaller groups within each.

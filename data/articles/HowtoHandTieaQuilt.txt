 Use a strong, natural thread; you can use embroidery thread but crochet thread is also fine. You can even use wool, but be careful not to use anything too thick because it may be difficult to pull through the three layers of the quilt and thicker thread can tend to pull the wadding through the fabric.;
, Leave a tail of about 2" (5cm) of thread to tie the quilt.
 This extra step is worth the effort to secure the knot.
 You should now have two threads both 2" (5cm) long. Tie these in a double knot. You can leave the ends that length or trim them to about an inch (2.5cm). Trimming them any shorter than that is not recommended.

 All you need to do is say the male English name "Louie" (as in Louis C.K., Louis Armstrong, Louis XIV, and so on). That's it! No extra work required.


Trivia: The Louis Vuitton brand is named after its founder, Louis Vuitton, a French craftsman and businessman who started the company in the 1850s. That's why the first word in the company's name can be pronounced like the name "Louie" — it is that name.;
, The first syllable should be pronounced "vit" (rhymes with "fit"). Ignore the U — in English, it's more or less silent.


You can also use a softer "voot" sound (rhymes with "foot"; not "boot") if you prefer.
 Put the the stress in the word on this syllable — it's "vit-TAHN", not "VIT-tahn".


In English, stressing the second syllable of a two-syllable word is usually used for verbs, not nouns.However, in this case, most native speakers don't find this confusing — perhaps because the word has a foreign origin.
 You've got everything you need to say "Louis Vuitton" now! Give it a few tries: "Loo-ee Vit-ahn." Practice makes perfect, so don't be afraid to start saying it out loud, even if others are around.
 Some English speakers who like to sound fancy or high-class when they're talking about the bag they just bought throw in just a little French pronunciation at the very end of the typical English version of "Louis Vuitton." To do this, instead of ending with the normal "tahn" sound, try "toh" (almost rhymes with "thaw"). This isn't quite how the French say it, but for the average English speaker, it's a good compromise compared to trying to work out tricky French vowels.


For extra points, try to push just a little air out of your nose when you end the word. If you do it right, you'll sound just a little stuck-up — the perfect compliment to that "just bought a new bag" feeling.

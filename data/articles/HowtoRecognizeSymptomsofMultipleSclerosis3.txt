 Make an appointment with your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms that resemble MS. Your doctor can recommend next steps and, if need be, make an MS diagnosis.


Donâ€™t wait to make an appointment. Seeing your doctor sooner rather than later means you can start any necessary treatment earlier. This may help alleviate your current symptoms.
 Arriving at an MS diagnosis involves using specific tests to rule out other diagnoses. A diagnosis of MS typically involves blood tests to rule out other conditions and an MRI to obtain detailed images of the brain and spinal cord. Your doctor might also suggest a lumbar puncture and/or an evoked potential (EP) test., Different medications are used to manage the symptoms of MS, modify the disease course, and treat relapses. Your doctor may prescribe symptom-specific medication. To learn more about medications typically used to treat specific symptoms, visit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society website at

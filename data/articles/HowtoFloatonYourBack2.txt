 Though it may not feel comfortable to place your ears in the water at first, just tip back your head until your ears are completely submerged. If your ears are out of the water, it means that your neck will be straining and that your body will be able to float less easily.
 Once your ears are submerged, lift your chin. You can lift it slightly, just an inch or two out of the water, or even lift it much more, so that it's pointing up toward the ceiling or sky. This will help you tip back your head and will make your entire body more buoyant.
 As you place your ears underwater and begin to lift your chin, make sure that the water line is at mid-cheek. It may be slightly lower if you raise your chin more dramatically.
 Keep your head centered so you don't tilt to one side or the other. Keeping your head centered will keep the rest of your body centered.

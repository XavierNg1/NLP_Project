, Steak and kidney pie and grilled kidneys are two common ways to consume kidneys.
 Fry it swiftly (about 3 minutes), turn halfway through frying. Delicious served with fried onions and bacon and mashed potato.
 Pigs provide many choices, including pâté, small intestine sausages (chitterlings) and black pudding (blood filled digestive tract). A jelly is also made from head and ears known as brawn.
 Cattle tongue can be boiled or pickled, intestines and tripe and brains are other parts of the cattle used for culinary purposes.
 The livers of lambs and calves are considered to be the best to consume. If you are using the liver of pigs, soak it in milk first as it tastes quite strong.
 This is a tradition in the soup area.
 Lambs' brains are delicate and calves' brains are best in pie.
 Sweetbreads are the thymus gland and pancreas of calves and lambs. Soak before blanching and frying in breadcrumbs.
 Not a lot of people can stomach tripe (no pun intended) as its texture is well, rather unusual. But if you've a cast iron stomach, maybe give it a go.

, You don't have to paint them every day, but keep them clean and even. Keep toenails well-groomed and painted as well.
 Even if your skin is acne-free, cleanse with a gel cleanser each night. Follow with a moisturizer and maybe an acne gel. If you have severe acne, please go to a dermatologist! The best drugstore acne soap brands to use are Neutrogena and Clean&Clear.
 If you have perfect or nearly-perfect clear skin, foundation will make you break out so don't use it. Just pat on a good concealer, and top with sheer powder foundation to create a blank canvas to work on. Now, apply neutral eyeshadow to your lids and a highlighting shade on you browbone. Swipe on a coat of mascara, and if you want to blend some eyeliner onto eyes. Swipe on a coat of clear gloss, and you have that 'I'm naturally pretty' look.
 Try layers with side bangs or just a razor-cut layered trim. You can add highlights, but get them pretty thin so they look as natural as possible.
 You will look and feel fantastic!

, Use mouthwash AND floss each morning and night. You can also use Crest Whitestrips or Aquafresh White Trays.
 If your hair isn't visible, don't start shaving yet. You can also pluck any stray eyebrow hairs. If you want to, you can shave or wax your arms, too. That's just a personal preference, though, so it's up to you. Warning: If you have removed body hair, it may appear thicker/darker as it grows back. It will then take a while to go back to normal, so make sure you would be committed to regular plucking/shaving/waxing.
 There may be a style you never even thought of that you would love! Don't be afraid to try something alternative, as long as it suits you.

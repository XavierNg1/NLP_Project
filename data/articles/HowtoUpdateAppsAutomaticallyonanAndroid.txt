 Find the Google Play Store app in your app drawer or on your home screen, and tap it to open it. The Google Play store app icon is a small white shopping bag with a small Google Play logo (a triangle consisting of blue, green, orange, and red) on it.;
, Once you are in the Google Play Store, tap the menu icon in the top left-hand of the app screen. The menu icon appears as three gray lines stacked vertically. Tapping the menu icon will bring up a slide filled with your own personal information.
, You will now be taken to a page where you have the option to see your currently installed apps and all apps you’ve ever installed in the past. Tap the app icon for the app you’d like to set up auto-update for, and you will be taken to the app store listing for that particular app.
 In the top right corner, you’ll see another menu icon consisting of three vertically stacked dots. Tap this icon, and a pop-up for auto-update will appear. If there is a white tick in a blue box, auto-update for this app has already been enabled. If there is a white box with a grey border, the app has not been set up for auto-update. If your auto-update option shows as the latter, then simply tap the box to turn on auto-update for that app.
 Press the Back button on your device to return to the previous “My apps” page. If there are more apps you’d like to auto-update, just access their Google Play page, open the menu, and check the Auto-update box.
 If you would like to avoid data charges, it would be best to set up auto-update when connected to Wi-Fi only. To do this, access the Google Play app menu, go to Settings >> General, and tap the option for “Auto-update apps over Wi-Fi only.” This will ensure that updating of the apps will only occur when your device is connected to a Wi-Fi.

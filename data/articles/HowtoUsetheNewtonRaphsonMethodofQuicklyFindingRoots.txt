, In cell A1, type, "Square" (w/o the quotation marks) and adjust column width to fit the phrase. Select column B and Format Cells Number for 14 decimal places. Expand the column width if need be.
 In this example, it is 685.
 In cell A2, type "InitialROOTGuess" (w/o the quotation marks). Since 25^2 = 625, and 30^2 = 900, we will use 25. Please input 25 in cell B2

, Doing so will assign the defined variable name "Square" to cell B1, as well as the defined variable name "InitialROOTGuess" to cell B2.


The Newton-Raphson method is that guess X(1) (read X sub 1) = X(0) + f(X(0))/f'(X(0)). In this case, where x^2 = 685, f(x) = x^2 - 685 = 0 and f'(x) = 2x. Therefore, into cell B3, please input the following formula (w/o quotation marks) "=InitialROOTGuess-((InitialROOTGuess^2-Square)/(2*InitialROOTGuess))"

, The formula will be taking each previous guess and using it to get a better current answer by a factor of 2 more significant digits each computation.


You should see the correct answer, 26.1725046566048, which is the square root of 685, in cell B6. Please notice how fast the Newton-Raphson method arrived at the correct answer.
 For simple expressions such as 4x^3, to obtain the derivative, one takes the exponent down and multiplies it as a (combined) coefficient, and reduces the exponent by 1 power, so the derivative of x^n = nx^(n-1) and the derivative of 4x^3 = 12x^2. If there is a constant such as Ï€ in the expression as a factor, that is treated as the 4 just was above in 4x^3 -- it remains. If there is a lone x, such as in the expression 4x^3 - x, the derivative of that is 12x^2 - 1, since x^0 = 1. if there is a constant added such as 4x^3 + 10, it is dropped, and the derivative is 12x^2.
, In the new cell A1, type "Power" (w/o quotation marks). Format cell C1 with a border and red font and input 10 into cell C1.
 when Power = 10. Therefore, we have (a+10) = a^10, so F(X) = a^10 - a - 10 and F'(x) = 10*a^9 - 1. Our InitialROOTGuess will be 1 since 1+10 = 11 and 1^10 = 1, but 2+10 = 12 and 2^10 = 1024 (which is much too large). We do not know the "square", which is actually a^10 -- not a square -- or sum (a+b) yet. Do not input an InitialROOTGuess yet however. Let's preserve the square root function we made in columns A and B by moving over and working in column C.
 Select cell C1 and Insert Name Define Powerful for it. You may type "Powerful" into B1 if you so choose. Select cell C3 and input the following formula (w/o quotes): "=InitialGuess+(((InitialGuess)^Powerful)-Powerful-InitialGuess)/(Powerful*(-InitialGuess)^(Powerful-1)". The evaluated result should equal 2. This has modified the derivative in the denominator somewhat by dropping the constant; in this case, that is necessary, along with changing the sign of the InitialGuess in the final term. Call it the Garthwaite method if you please -- it is part of trying to arrive at the base instead of the root.

An InitialGuess of -1 will result in the answer -1.24233531640777 and that is also correct in that (-1.24233531640777 + 10) = -1.24233531640777^10 = 8.75766468359223

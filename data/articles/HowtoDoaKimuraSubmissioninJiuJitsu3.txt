 Work your way into a mount position, straddling your opponent with both legs. You weight should be centered over your hips to keep them from being able to sweep you or otherwise free themselves. Sliding your knees up into their armpits will also help make your mount more stable.The mount is a less common position to apply the kimura from than the guard or side control, but it can be a useful variation to learn nonetheless.
In addition to the kimura, a full mount will set you up to perform a variety of submissions, including the americana, guillotine choke or arm triangle., The higher up on your opponent’s body you are, the more they’ll be forced to reach to defend. If you can catch hold of one of their arms while they’re struggling for an escape or reversal, you’ll be able to score a kimura without altering your position.Lean your upper body forward and pull your knees up toward your shoulders, keeping your center of gravity low.If the opponent has their arms around your midsection to defend against strikes or submissions. you can break their grip by taking a step forward on one knee and pushing down on their head with your free hand.
 While maintaining your base squarely over your opponent’s chest, use your elbow to pin their arm to your side. Then, turn your upper body slightly to take hold of their wrist with your same side hand. Loop your opposite hand around the back of their arm and clutch your own wrist in the familiar kimura technique.Be careful not to lose top control while turning to grab their wrist.
 Keeping the arm tight to your chest, crank the opponent’s wrist in the direction of their head. Because of your superior positioning, it won’t take much force to make them submit.Unlike other positions, finishing the kimura from the mount is more about rotating your shoulders than pulling with your arms.
Step over and hook your opponent’s head with your opposite leg to gain even more leverage.

 A bight is simple a curled piece of rope, with both strands pointing in the same direction. For a painter hitch, form the first bight so you have roughly one foot of rope to the right of the bight and the rest of the rope to the left.


For this knot you will need to create three interlocking bights.;
, Usually, this is a horizontal bar, but you could also push the bight through a metal ring as well and secure the rope to this. Either way, you want the bight to hang over the object you're tying it to.
 There will be two strands of rope on top of the bar, and the bight coming underneath it back towards your hands.


As long as you have something to lay the bite over and tuck under, you can use it to make a painter hitch.
 You have a bight in a bight. It sounds complicated, but it doesn't have to be. Simply pinch the left strand with two fingers to create a U-shape, then pull this U through your first bight.


The two bights should be roughly perpendicular to each other. It almost looks like the outline of half a sombrero.
The fact that the rope is on the left is not important. What is important is that you use the side with a lot of rope slack left, not the shorter side. The longer side is called the "standing" rope., Holding the two bights in your left hand, create a third with the small strand of rope in your right. Again, it is simply a U-shape bend in the rope.
 Again, pinch the rope, then pull it through the bite you just made with the leftmost strand of rope. You should now have three interlocked bights. There will be one strand of rope leading back to your body and a small tail of rope hanging off.
 Hold onto the knot to keep it in place, then yank on the standing rope to tighten it.
 This will almost instantly collapse the knot. If you're in a position that requires a sturdier knot, there is really no reason to use the painter hitch.

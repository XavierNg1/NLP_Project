 Place the tail of the arrow firmly into the grip fingers on the string. Rest the body of the arrow on the ledge provided on the frame of the bow.;
, Make sure that the release mechanism wrist support is firmly and comfortably on the wrist of the bow arm. Clip the release mechanism to the thin loop of rope that extends back from the grip fingers on the string.
 Breaking the bow over will require a considerable pull which should be performed with the arrow pointing down.
 With the help of the release mechanism, pull the string back until it is at the jaw of the archer.
 Relax physically and mentally; then point the arrow at the target.
 The release mechanism will have either a thumb trigger or a finger trigger. Thumb release mechanisms are preferred by target shooters. Thumb releases are designed not to push down with the thumb, but rather to squeeze the entire hand. Finger triggers are commonly used by hunters. Start squeezing slowly and steadily.
 Avoid the temptation to rapidly squeeze the hand or jab with the finger. This will cause the bow assembly to jerk. Concentrate on keeping the arrow trained at the target while gently and steadily squeezing. The arrow will fire when everything comes into place, rather than at the precise moment of deciding to shoot. This type of release is called the surprise release. It is the most effective way to make sure that the arrow is aimed properly at the time of release.

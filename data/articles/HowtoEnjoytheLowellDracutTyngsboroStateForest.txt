 While walking it's good to have a map or trail guide with you. This PDF file shows you a general trail map with the main and smaller trails.
 Motorized vehicles, except for snow mobiles, are prohibited. Snow mobiles can be used when there is 1 inch (2.5Â cm) or more of snow on the ground. The forest is available to hikers, horseback riding, and skiers. Hunting is available during specific months, mostly during the winter., The main gate entrance (with parking) of the forest is located on Trotting Park Road, off of Varnum Ave in Lowell. There is a smaller parking entrance between G7 and G8 on Trotting Park Road, off of Althea Road in Tyngsboro. Smaller gate entrances can be found on Totman Road and Thompson Lane.
 Allow anywhere up to 2 1/2 hours to enjoy and hike on the trails. Most of the main trails will have smaller trails attached to them. The main roads within the forest are Trotting Park Road, Carney Road, and Althea Road., From beaver dams to the historical Sheep Rock, there's always something to see. In Tyngsboro, there's Whortle-Berry Hill and Althea Lake. The fauna that resides in the forest includes foxes, beavers, ducks, squirrels, and other animals.
 Nothing is more exciting to see than a winter forest. Smaller trails are more challenging to follow, so try to stick on the main routes as much as possible. Please be very alert and careful when ice forms on the ground.

 As in all gymnastics wikihows, the first step is always stretch This is important because it is possible to pull a muscle if you do not stretch. The most important thing to stretch is your back, so do lots of bridges and chin stands. However, it is also important to stretch your splits, wrists and neck.,;
, A backbend is different from a bridge. A backbend is when you start from a standing position and arch down into a bridge.
 Balance is an important part of complete a single hand back walkover, so work on your balance before attempting a one handed back walkover.
 It is almost impossible to do a one-handed back walkover without a great back walkover.
 The hand on the bottom will be the hand you keep on the ground. This will help you practice your balance by only having one point of balance. Repeat as necessary.
 This will help you work up to doing a back walkover with your hands at your side.
 Start with both or one hand(s) up, as suits you. Lean back, and put your hand on the ground. Lean slightly to the side to keep your balance. Bring you leg down as soon as possible. Be aware you are not likely to complete this the first time. Don't be discouraged. With practice, you can make it!.
 Practice every day, but for no more than 30 minutes. Unless you are an advanced gymnast, doing this will cause too much strain on your back, possibly pulling a muscle.

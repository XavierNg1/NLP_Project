 Borage is best sown direct in the garden via seed, as the seedlings don't transplant well once established.


Tip cuttings from a mature borage plant can be placed in sandy soil in spring. Keep the soil damp and place cuttings in the garden when they have taken hold but before they're too established.;
, Borage will tolerate partial shade though. Borage likes most soil types provided they're well aerated, moist, and mulched. Its favorite soil type is sandy.
, Leave 60cm (2 feet) between the plants.
 Don't over-water.
 Expect maturity of the borage plant within six weeks. The flowers appear at an early stage and can be picked during summer growth for use in culinary ways. When picking flowers, choose those that are open (although Violet Stevenson advises that they are best picked before they open if you want to preserve their color). The leaves can also be used. Some ideas for use include:


Adding to gin-based summer cocktails
Placing the young leaves into salads cooked like spinach or dipped in batter as fritters

Use the leaves uncooked in salads and soups, as they have a cucumber flavor
Add sprigs to wine, cider, and fruit drinks
Freeze the flowers into ice cubes

Use the flowers as garnishes in salads

Candy the flowers for cake decorations.

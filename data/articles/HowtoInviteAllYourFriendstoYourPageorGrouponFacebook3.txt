 You can do this on any browser or version of the mobile app.
 This option is on the right side of your screen, directly beneath the Page likes counter. Clicking this prompts a pop-up window with your friends' names.


For mobile, tap "Invite friends to like this Page". This is underneath the "Home" tab.
 This should be on the right side of the pop-up window; clicking "Invite" will automatically send an invite to that friend. You can also type a friend's name into the field marked "Search all friends" at the top of this window.


For mobile, tap the "Invite" option next to friends' names to invite each individual friend. If you want to search for a specific friend, type their name into the search bar at the top of the screen.
 This is at the bottom of the pop-up window. You have successfully invited friends to your Facebook page!


On mobile, tap the backward-facing arrow at the top of your screen to exit the "Invite" menu.

 Point your toes slightly outwards and keep your arms at your sides. Pull your shoulders back, which will force you to keep your back straight throughout the movement., Push your butt back and down, like you’re trying to sit down on a low box. Keep your abs tight. Bring your arms up in front of you to help you keep your balance and inhale.


Make sure you don’t let your knees go past your toes. This puts additional strain on your knees and could cause an injury.
If you’re not very flexible, you might not be able to reach parallel depth on your squat. That’s fine, just go as far down as you can without injuring yourself., Your weight should be in your heels as you push up. This will keep you from tipping over forward and putting too much strain on your knees. Extend your legs until you’ve returned to the starting position, with arms by your sides.


Exhale as you push your way up., This is the ideal range for a balance of strength building and muscle development. You might not be able to complete all the prescribed reps when you start, which is fine; just do what you can until you work your way up to 10 reps.


If the bodyweight squat is too easy for you, try the jump squat. The movement is essentially the same, except that as you push up, you jump as high as you can.

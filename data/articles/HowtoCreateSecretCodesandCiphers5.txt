 Regardless of its name, Morse Code is a cipher. Dots and dashes represent long and short electrical signals which, in turn, represent the letters of the alphabet. This enabled old-time electrical communication (telegraphs). Common letters in Morse, represented as long ( _ ) and short (.) signals, include:


R ; S ; T ; L : ._. ; _.. ; _ ; ._..
A ; E ; O : ._ ; . ; _ _ _, Many greats in history, like the genius Leonardo da Vinci, have written out messages as they would look reflected in a mirror. Because of this, enciphering in this fashion is often called "mirror writing." These kinds of ciphers can be difficult at first, but generally become second nature quickly.Transposition ciphers generally treat messages or the formation of letters visually. The image of the message is transformed to hide its meaning., Binary is the language of 1's and 0's used by computers. Combinations of these 1's and 0's can be enciphered and then deciphered with a binary key, or by calculating the values represented by the 1's and 0's for each letter communicated in a message.


The name "Matt" would encipher to binary as: 01001101 ; 01000001 ; 01010100 ; 01010100.

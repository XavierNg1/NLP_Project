 This process is also known as an auto bidding system. Buyers can set their maximum bid for the product.  So, if the bidder is not virtually present at the time of bidding, automatically the bidding will perform on his behalf up to the defined amount. This information is only made visible to the bidder. After reaching the defined bid value, the bidding will stop.


For example: The starting bid for an item is $5. A is the high bidder to place a maximum bid of $6 on this item. His maximum bid of $20 which will be kept confidential from other members. B places a bid of $7 and becomes the highest bidder. Automatically A’s bid is raised to $8 outbidding B at $7. It will continue till the time any buyer crosses $20. It is the limit set by $A which is only known to him. If nobody crosses $20, then A is the winner. If anyone crosses $20, A will receive a mail to increase its limit.
 Buyer is supposed to enter maximum bid after selecting their favorite item from the online auction. After placing, it is not necessary for the buyer to be present for bidding. The bid amount will keep on increasing on his behalf, outbidding others till it reaches the defined value.
 Keep visiting the online auction regularly to check the status of your bid and your competitor bids. Evaluate your bid again and click the confirm bid button, once done.
 Once the bidding ends, the winner will be notified by an email from the auction website. It will indicate whether you have won the product and also the explanation of what needs to be done next. You can also recheck by checking your name as a highest bidder on the auction website. ,

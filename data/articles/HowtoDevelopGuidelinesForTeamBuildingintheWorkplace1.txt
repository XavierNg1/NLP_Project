 Your team's goal might be to release a new version of a product by a specific date. Or the goal might be to conduct market research in order to create a marketing plan. Be as specific as possible about the eventual goal.


Distribute the goal in writing to all team members. Ideally, you'll do this in person in a team meeting so that you can answer any questions and concerns. A goals meeting also helps the group to develop consensus on the direction of the team or company.;

 Heating systems absorb moisture from the air, leaving rooms dry. This dryness can dehydrate your body, including your throat and vocal cords. To lose your voice fast, turn up the heat in your room or home as much as possible and leave it at that temperature overnight., Cold, dry air can irritate the larynx and hinder the vocal cords, diminishing your voice. If you are living in a cold climate, get outside for prolonged winter activities (e.g. cross-country skiing) or go for a long walk outdoors. If you are living in a warm climate, crank up the air-conditioning as much as possible., To help lose your voice fast, increase the ambient noise level in your home or work space so that you automatically have to speak louder or yell to communicate. People tend to naturally increase their voices by 3 decibels for every 10 decibel increase in ambient noise around them. Play loud music or movies in the background, or opt for instrumental scores if you need to concentrate without distractions.

 If you have tried to eliminate all of the factors in your life that might contain triggers such as pollen, mold, and dust, but you still have problems, you need to see an allergist. She can run tests to determine the cause of your hay fever. One of the most popular test is a skin test called the scratch, or prick, test. This test lasts for 10 to 20 minutes and involves administering tiny drops of samples of possible allergens on pricked or scratched skin. The nurse will observe the sites for reactions on the skin.


Some reactions are immediate. If there is an allergic reaction, the skin where a specific allergen was applied will become raised and will look like a mosquito bite.
The nurse will measure and note the reaction and the doctor will interpret the results., Your allergist may also perform a skin test called the intradermal test. Instead of putting the allergen on scratched or pricked skin, the allergens are injected under the skin by your doctor with a thin needle. This test is typically more sensitive than the scratch test.


This test lasts for about 20 minutes., To further solidify the skin test results, your allergist may also run a blood test, called radioallergosorbent test (RAST). The RAST measures the amount of allergy-causing antibodies in your bloodstream, known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. This tells the doctor which allergens your body is reacting to by the breakdown of the antibodies in your blood.


The results of this test usually take a few days to come back since the blood sample is sent to a laboratory for processing.

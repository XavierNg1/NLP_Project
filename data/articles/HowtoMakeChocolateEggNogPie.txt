, Note: The images shown in this recipe use removable springform cheesecake molds; you only need to press crumb mixture down into a flat base if using these. If using a pie pan (a clear Pyrex one is prettiest), you may find it useful to press the mixture down with another pie pan to make it even. Set aside while preparing filling.
 Heat the eggnog to boiling over a low heat in the top part of a double boiler on the stove top. Stir constantly to prevent burning or boiling over.
 Stir to blend the melted chocolate into the eggnog.
 Keep stirring the mixture until the gelatin is fully dissolved.
 Let filling cool to room temperature.
 Pour pie filling into the previously prepared pie shell or spring form and level gently.
 It's best to cover with plastic cling film to prevent refrigerator odors from tainting the pie.
 Remove from spring form (if using). Top pie with whipped cream, plain yogurt or a berry coulis.
 If you wish, present the pie with non-edible, seasonal ornaments such as small pine cones (shown here) or other non-toxic items—just make sure your pie-eating friends are aware of what's dessert and what's décor!

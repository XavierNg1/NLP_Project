 Pick up fresh fruit from the farmer's market or your local grocery store and make sure that they are nice and ripe and ready to be made into a salad. If they are not ripe enough, then the salad will be a bit tough to chew. It is better for them to be a bit overripe than unripe so that the flavors blend. For this simple fruit salad, you'll need strawberries, cherries, blueberries, red apples, peaches, and a kiwi.






;
, It's important to wash all of your fruits before you dice them into a salad.
 If you want the salad to be easy to eat without having to run into any cherry pits, then you should halve 1 cup of red cherries before you put them into the salad. Just cut each cherry in half and remove its pit.
 Place 1 cup (140 g) of strawberries, 1 cup (140 g) of cherries, 1/2 of a red apple, 1/2 of a peach, and 1 kiwi on a cutting board and dice them into bite-sized pieces, measuring over 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so.
 You can coat the bowl in 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of lemon juice first to sweeten the fruit and keep them from oxidizing quickly. Place the strawberries, chopped cherries, 1/2 of a red apple, 1/2 of a peach, 1 kiwi, and 1/2 a cup (70 g) of blueberries together in the bowl. You can toss them lightly to blend the flavors.
 Enjoy this dish at room temperature or slightly chilled. Pair this dish with a glass of orange juice to help bring out its fruity flavor.

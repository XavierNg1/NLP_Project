Requirements for sellers are different from users who want only to buy, so it may take a few days before eBay clears your credit card or banking information and you can begin selling.
Provide the required banking information and follow any other instructions they give you in regards to verifying your accounts.



Although feedback as a buyer does not give you the same credibility you will build over time as a good eBay seller, it does show you are a responsible member of the community.
If your current user ID doesn't meet the qualifications for selling, because you have not given eBay the extra information required on a seller's account, the company will notify you of this when you try to list an item for sale.
 Although users can buy on eBay with a private feedback profile, public feedback is required for all sellers.

,, The hammer needs to be made of a softer material than the wire, otherwise there is a risk of flattening or damaging the wire. Wood or brass is a good choice.


Start from the end of the wire. The straight starting section will be your baseline for the rest of the wire.


Sandwich the wire in between the wood and secure it in the vice, don't apply too much pressure. The straightening is done by pulling the wire through the 2 pieces of wood.






Another option is securing one end of the wire in a vice and then pulling along the wire with 2 pieces of wood.



Start by securing a U shaped arch into a piece of wood. This arch can be made out of a sufficiently strong staple or a nail. The arch should have just enough distance between the wood to allow the wire to pass through underneath it.
Hammer nails into 2 straight lines with the width of the wire being the distance between the lines.
Pull the wire through the row of nails.
Repeat if necessary.

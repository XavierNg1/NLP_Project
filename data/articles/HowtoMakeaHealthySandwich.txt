 While bread itself, in moderation, is very healthy, consider:


High-fiber whole wheat bread.
High protein bread.
Wraps and pita bread (they are thin and have fewer calories).
Reduced calorie bread.
Multi-grain bread.;
, Most (although not all) sandwiches benefit from tasty, high-quality protein. What is available and tasty to you may vary by region. Keep in mind portion control--a serving of meat should be about the size of a deck of playing cards. Consider for choices:


Classic deli meats: Turkey, chicken, ham, roast beef, corned beef, and others.
Vegetarian spreads: Hummus, peanut butter, cashew butter, tahini, vegetarian patties, Vegemite, and more.
Salads: Tuna fish salad, seafood salad, chicken salad.
 Although cheese can add a good deal of fat, it also contains a good deal of calcium.


Harder cheeses (such as Swiss and Cheddar) usually have less fat.
Softer cheeses (like Blue cheese) may have more fat, but if spread thinly, can add overall less fat than slices of hard cheese.
 Sandwiches usually taste best with a little condiment added--but it is optional.


Mustard, nonfat salad dressings, salsa, and nonfat mayonnaise all add little calories and lots of flavor.
Avoid high-fat salad dressings, whole real mayonnaise, and oil-based dressings.
 A sandwich is a great way to slip in a lot of vegetables into a meal. Make sure they are fresh. Consider:


Sliced tomatoes
Olives
Cucumbers or pickles
Onions: Sweet, hot, or red.
Peppers: sweet or hot.
Lettuce
Bean sprouts
Apples (especially good with ham)
Sauerkraut (With corned beef and blue cheese dressing is a classic Reuben Sandwich)
Herbs (Basil tastes lovely with toasted cheese and tomato)

, Or wrap your wrap.
 This is entirely optional. Heating or toasting a sandwich adds no calories, and can greatly enhance the taste. Do not toast lettuce--it doesn't taste very good. Add it after heating.

 Roll out the fondant with a rolling pin until it is 1.5 centimeter (0.6 in) thick, 15 centimeter (5.9 in) in width and 20 centimeter (7.9 in) in length. Arrange so that the 20 centimeter (7.9 in) length is the side closest to you.;
, Lift the top of the fondant, the side furthest from you. Pull it towards you and fold it to create a smaller layered piece of icing that is 3 centimeter (1.2 in) thick and 7.5 centimeter (3.0 in) wide. Try to leave space and volume in the fold to create a larger bloom.
 Trim 1 centimeter (0.4 in) of length from each end of the folded icing.
 Begin to roll up the icing from one of your newly trimmed ends, like a Swiss roll. As you roll, hold the end where the two folds meet as the actual fold of the icing will form the rose petals.
 When you have the rose to its desired width and fullness, pinch the base that you have been holding to give the rose a more conical shape.
 After cutting off any excess icing, carefully push back and separate the layers with a cocktail stick to give the flower more shape.
 Finish by cutting little leave shapes out of green icing and stick to the underside of the rose.

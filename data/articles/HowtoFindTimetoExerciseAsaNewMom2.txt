 A great way to get exercise after you have a baby is to put the baby in a stroller and go for a walk. Your baby can get out of the house and you can get some sunshine and exercise.Invite friends to go with you so you can socialize while exercising.
Make sure to protect your baby from the elements. Dress them correctly for the warm or cool weather, put a hat on them, and put sunscreen on them.
 Getting some rigorous exercise is important after you have a baby. When you feel comfortable, you can upgrade from walking with your baby in a stroller to jogging. Make sure to buy a jogging stroller to use instead of using the regular stroller.Make sure you wait until your baby is at least six months old before you start jogging with them. Before that, they are too young and small to be bounced around as much.
 Take your baby outdoors for some fresh air and go hiking. This can allow you time to bond with your baby and let them experience the excitement of nature while you get some time to exercise.If your baby is very young, put your baby in a sling or a front carrier. If you use a sling, make sure the baby is well supported and comfortable for the hike.
If your baby is older, you can put them in a backpack carrier.

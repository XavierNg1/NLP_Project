 Insulin needs an occasional "adjustment" -- because of having (1) possibly not used/forgotten a dose of insulin -- or the dose of insulin was not enough: (2) or did little or no exercise, not burning the sugar and leaving sugar too high -- or 3) eating too much food, especially of the wrong foods, including too rich and sugary, starchy and greasy foods) for the amount of insulin injected; combinations of those raise sugar to a dangerous level.
, Ask your friend and their parents about what you can learn what to do in these situations!


As above, "test, treat, wait, re-test" but for high blood sugar.
 Don't hesitate to call the ambulance.
, Have someone show you how to give insulin shots, so you can give one in an emergency, when the patient is unable to do so.
 A diabetic diet is very healthy. Your friend will appreciate the support.



Ask about being hungry after dinner: suggest your friend to: "Ask your doctor about adjusting insulin so that you won't usually "need" to eat an unhealthy, heavy snack to counterattack your evening insulin".
Your friend can use these "free" foods that have few, if any, carbohydrates and calories, so one of them won't cause weight gain or increase blood sugar -- from Mayo Clinic article:

A serving of sugar-free gelatin,
Five baby carrots,
Two saltine crackers,
One vanilla wafer,
Four almonds (or similar nuts),
One piece of gum or small hard candy.
Any food with less than approximately 10g of carbohydrate for a child and 15g for an adult is okay between injections

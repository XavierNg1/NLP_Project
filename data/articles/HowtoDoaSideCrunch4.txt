 Lay on one side of your body with your legs extended out straight, and on top of each other. Place your lower arm’s elbow on the floor, and make sure your elbow is directly underneath your shoulder. Prop and hold your body up on your elbow., From your propped position, place your upper arm’s hand behind your head.Inhale and contract your side abdominal muscles to crunch and bring your upper elbow down toward your side. As you crunch, the lower half of your torso and your hips are going to dip down to the floor. Hold the crunch position for a moment, exhale, then flex your side abdominal muscles again to bring your upper elbow and torso back up to your starting position.As you come back to your starting position, you can extend even further than you started, brining your elbow back and tilting your head down to the ground.This will give your upper torso a convex curve.
 Once you have completed one set of side crunches on one side of your body (approximately 10–15 reps), turn over and get into the same starting position as before, with your legs extended and your elbow propping up your body.


Complete approximately 1–3 sets of 10–15 reps.

 "Collect the honey that drips from the ceiling, but watch for swarms of killer bees!";
,, Pause your character and start ducking when the hives shake.
 This will tell you where the honey will drip.



The character with the most drips of honey collected wins the minigame.
If two or more players have the same amount of drips, those players win the minigame.
If all players have the same amount of drips, it is considered a tie.

 If you want to keep your rabbit away from particular plants and crops, be sure to safeguard them with fencing. Use chicken wire so that light can still get through to your plants.The fencing should be at least 3 feet tall with an extra half a foot buried underground to prevent digging under it.
The mesh should be no bigger than 1 inch.
You can also keep your rabbit confined to an area of the garden where they can’t get to your plant beds.
 Rabbits are known for destroying gardens with their chewing and digging. To minimize these destructive behaviors, provide them with toys when they’re outside that offer convenient alternatives to having their way with your yard.Chew toys like wicker balls and willow sticks can distract your rabbit from your plants.
Tunnel toys and digging boxes can keep your rabbit entertained while protecting them from the sun and possible predators. They also allow your pet to express their digging impulses in a safe way instead of destroying your raised beds or scooping out an escape route.
 If you’re keeping your rabbit in a pen or run, regularly relocate where it is in your garden to minimize the impact on your grass. That way, you can maintain a healthy lawn that both you and your bunny can enjoy.

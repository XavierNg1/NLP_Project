 If you see your cat eating or chewing plastic, lightly tap it on the nose and say, “No!” You could also try spraying it with water.It’s important to stop your cat immediately so it makes a connection between chewing plastic and your negative response.;
, Do your best to remove all plastic items that might tempt your cat. Dispose of plastic bags immediately in a lidded trash can or recycling bin. Store any plastic items in drawers or cupboards that your cat can’t open.Try keeping trash or recycling bins lined with plastic bags in closed rooms or cupboards that your cat can’t access.
 Bring canvas bags with you when you go to the grocery store instead of using plastic store bags. If your cat chews hard plastic, switch from plastic to glass bottles where you can. Keep any plastic bottles or containers on hand in the fridge or other inaccessible area.
 Discourage your cat from chewing or eating plastic items by making them as unappealing as possible. Spray any plastic bags, electrical cords, or other tempting items with citrus air freshener. You can also try other non-toxic, unappealing things like hot sauce, bitter apple spray, or a pet deterrent available at your local pet store.

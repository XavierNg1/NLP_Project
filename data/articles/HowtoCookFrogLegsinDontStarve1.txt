 They’re both available through the Tool tab (crossed axe and pickaxe icon). Axes cost 1 each of Twig (gathered from dried-out bushes scattered in the world) and Flint (sharp-looking rock that’s scattered everywhere in the game), while pickaxes cost 2 each of the same materials.


To use tools, select it by right-clicking on the tool (PC) or scrolling to it with the right analog stick and pressing the right button of the D-pad (PS4). Go up to the tree (axe) or boulder (pickaxe) and hold down the left mouse button (PC) or X button (PS4) to wear them down to states you can gather with.;
, Aside from making sure you have enough Twigs, you also need to gather some Cut Grass, gathered from long tufts of grass found scattered everywhere in the world. Make sure you chop down some trees for your logs too.


Gathering some Rocks would also be useful if you want to make fire pits.
 When you have at least 2 Logs and 3 Cut Grass, you can make fire! Click the bonfire icon to your left, and on the very top of the list is a campfire. Campfires are essential because they’re the most reliable and easiest way to generate light during nighttime, as well as make a good way to cook your food, which can either prolong its freshness or increase the benefits to your health, hunger, and sanity when you eat it. You can make multiple campfires as long as you have enough resources.


Later on, if you’ve got at least 12 Rocks and 2 Logs, you can make a fire pit, which is a permanent version of a campfire and does not spread flames when you add too much fuel.
 Now simply select the Frog Legs, then go to your campfire, and you'll be prompted to cook them. Now, when you left-click or press X, you’ll immediately start cooking!

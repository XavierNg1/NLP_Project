,, Press the shift key and left-click on any NPC that you want to be nude. You will get new options.
 When in the 'spawn' button, find 'Toms clothing tester.' This will open a clothes rack.
 Find the 'Make Selectable' key. Once you've clicked on it, the uncontrollable Sim will now be a controllable Sim.
 Click on 'Plan Outfit,' then on the 'Formal' option. After you click on the option of your choice, you will see a nude male/female Sim.
 Make your other Sim build a relationship with the new Sim. This way, the new Sim can invite your first Sim to his/her house.
 Invite the first Sim to your place, then when he/she comes, just press shift and left-click, and choose 'Make Selectable.' (Make sure you've typed in the cheat code "boolprop testingCheatsEnabled true").
 Follow the same procedure that you did for the NPC Sim.

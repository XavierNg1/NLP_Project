 If you are darkening multiple items, make sure they are all similar in color. Start your normal wash cycle using cold water.


This method is most effective when used on cotton fabrics, like faded black t-shirts. The effects aren't as ideal on other types of fabrics.
If you want to restore clothing to a very rich black color, coffee is less effective than black fabric dye. Coffee will have more natural-looking results.
 The stronger the coffee, the darker the final outcome will be, so keep that in mind when brewing. You will need 2 cups of coffee for this so use a full sized coffee maker, not a single serve or smaller coffee maker.


You can also use 2 cups of black tea instead of the coffee for similar results, if that's your preference.
It doesn't matter how you get the two cups of coffee, as long as they are fresh and dark. If you're an instant coffee drinker, it's perfectly fine to make your coffee with that. Being brewed by a coffee maker isn't a requirement.
 Allow the rest of the cycle to finish up just as it normally would.


If you've used commercial fabric dyes on your clothing before, you'll notice that this method smells much better during the process and after.
The coffee method is also non-toxic, and you don't have to worry about coffee staining the basin of your washing machine.
 Machine drying dark garments can lead to fading, so get in the habit of always hanging up your black clothes after washing them to preserve their color. Once dry, the garment is ready to wear.

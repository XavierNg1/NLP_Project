 With feet hip-width apart, lunge forward with your right leg until your left shin is parallel to the ground. Pause for 3 seconds, pick your back leg up and step forward.


Continue walking forward, alternating legs, for 30 seconds. Rest, turn around, and do walking squats back to your starting point.
 Pick up a 3 to 5 lb. (1.4 to 2.27 kg) weight with each hand. Bend your knees, keep your back straight and lower your butt toward the ground, until your thighs are parallel with the ground.


Keep as much weight in your heels as possible. If you cannot squat all the way, then do partial squats, or do them without weights. Do 2 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions.
 Make sure your feet are flat on the floor, your arms are at your sides and your back is straight, leaning forward very slightly. Squeeze the ball with your inner thighs, hold it there for 3 seconds and slowly release the hold until you reach your starting position.


Do 2 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. If you do not have a small exercise ball that will fit between your legs, use a large, firm pillow instead. Make sure your movements are slow and steady. Work up to pausing for 10 seconds while you hold the ball in with your inner thighs.
 Put your feet shoulder-width apart and turn your feet out as much as you can, so that you are duck-toed. Tuck in your pelvis, bend your knees and lower yourself down as far as you can go.


If possible, brush the floor with the hand that is not holding onto the chair. Pause and rise up slowly. Make sure your knees never go past your toes. If they do, adjust your legs so they are further apart. Do 2 to 3 sets of 10 repetitions.

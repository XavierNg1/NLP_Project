 Without mitotic replication, your body would not be able to heal itself, or even grow. When mitosis happens, your DNA replicates itself. During mitosis, your cells divide and they also exhibit clear phases:First, the DNA condenses into chromosomes and the chromosomes align.
Then, the daughter chromosomes are pulled apart and they move to the cell poles (the edges of the cell).
Last, the cell splits in two separate cells.;
, In mitosis, the cells will only divide once. These post-division cells are called daughter cells. Most human cells divide by splitting into two new cells.Check the number of daughter cells. In mitosis, there should only be two.
The parent cell will be gone after mitosis has occurred.
 If the cell does not have a complete set of chromosomes, then it has not completed mitosis, or it has been damaged. Each healthy human somatic cell should have a complete set of chromosomes.

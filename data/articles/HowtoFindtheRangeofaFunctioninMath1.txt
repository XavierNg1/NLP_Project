 Let's say the formula you're working with is the following: f(x) = 3x2 + 6x -2. This means that when you place any x into the equation, you'll get your y value. This is the function of a parabola.;
, If you're working with a straight line or any function with a polynomial of an odd number, such as f(x) = 6x3+2x + 7, you can skip this step. But if you're working with a parabola, or any equation where the x-coordinate is squared or raised to an even power, you'll need to plot the vertex. To do this, just use the formula -b/2a to get the x coordinate of the function 3x2 + 6x -2, where 3 = a, 6 = b, and -2 = c. In this case -b is -6, and 2a is 6, so the x-coordinate is -6/6, or -1.Now, plug -1 into the function to get the y-coordinate. f(-1) = 3(-1)2 + 6(-1) -2 = 3 - 6 -2 = -5.
The vertex is (-1,-5). Graph it by drawing a point where the x coordinate is -1 and where the y-coordinate is -5. It should be in the third quadrant of the graph.
 To get a sense of the function, you should plug in a few other x-coordinates so you can get a sense of what the function looks like before you start to look for the range. Since it's a parabola and the x2 coordinate is positive, it'll be pointing upward. But just to cover your bases, let's plug in some x-coordinates to see what y coordinates they yield:


f(-2) = 3(-2)2 + 6(-2) -2 = -2. One point on the graph is (-2, -2)
f(0) = 3(0)2 + 6(0) -2 = -2. Another point on the graph is (0,-2)
f(1) = 3(1)2 + 6(1) -2 = 7. A third point on the graph is (1, 7).
 Now, look at the y-coordinates on the graph and find the lowest point at which the graph touches a y-coordinate. In this case, the lowest y-coordinate is at the vertex, -5, and the graph extends infinitely above this point. This means that the range of the function is y = all real numbers â‰¥ -5.

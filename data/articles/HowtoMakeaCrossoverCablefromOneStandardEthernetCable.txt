 With this guide, you will be able to use a long 100 feet (30.5Â m). cable, or a shorter size, whatever your needs require.;
, Be careful not to damage the wiring inside the cable or cut yourself.
 This will leave the inner wiring exposed. Examine how the wiring is twisted together and note the colors of the wires. For this project, we will be cutting the colored wires (green, orange, white-green, white-orange) and leaving the other wires in place as usual.
 The other wires will be left as-is.



First, strip the orange wire on both cut sides down. (approx. 1/4 or 1/2 inch)






After both ends of the orange wire has been stripped, strip both ends of the green wire down. (approx. 1/4 or 1/2 inch)







, Twist the wires together, and mend with electrical or another kind of tape. If you have a soldering iron, you can optionally solder the leads together.
 Lets continue on.



Start by stripping the green-white wires. (once again, approx. 1/4 or 1/2 inch)






Repeat the wire stripping on orange-white wires. (once again, approx. 1/4 or 1/2 inch)







, Twist the wires together and fix with tape. Again, if you prefer, you can solder the wires together as opposed to twisting them together.
 Join the orange-white wire on Side "A", with the green-white wire on Side "B". Fashion the wires with tape or solder.



Note the direction that the wiring in the cable case is twisting.






Holding the cable in your hands, twist the cable in the same way as the internal wiring is twisted.






Keep the wire twisted, and close it up with tape or shrink-wrap.

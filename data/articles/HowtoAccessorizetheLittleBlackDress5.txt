 If you don't have the money to go out and buy new accessories or you just don't want to add much to your LBD, treat your hair like an accessory. Pump up your hair with high volume whether it is loose or in a fancy up-do. Try a messy braid on the weekends when you're out and about., Accessorize your dress by styling your hair. A sparkly headband, a small jeweled crown, and an embellished bobby pin or barrette will create an extra feminine look while helping to secure your hair.Place your headband half an inch back from your hairline to hold everything in place., Try the traditional wide brimmed hat for a classic LBD look. Add a funky twist with a fedora over your messy braid., Since the LBD can often speak for itself, you may opt to skip accessories all together. Keep focus on the lines and shapes of the dress itself by accessorizing with nothing more than a timeless bright red lipstick., Pick a more traditional pair of black sunglasses and focus on the style and shape of the lens. Alternately, choose a trendier style. Try white or light pink rims with black lenses or black or silver rims with multi-colored lenses.

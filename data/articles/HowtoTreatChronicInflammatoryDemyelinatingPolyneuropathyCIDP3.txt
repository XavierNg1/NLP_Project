 CIDP is rare autoimmune disorder that causes your body to attack its own tissues. In CIDP patients, the body fights against the myelin sheaths that protect the nerves, which can lead to nerve damage. This condition is closely related to Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS), but it is considered to be a “chronic” version.CIDP has a variety of forms, including:


Sensory predominant CIDP.
Motor dominant CIDP.
Lewis-Sumner syndrome (LSS).
 Symptoms can include both motor and sensory impairments that progress over a period of 8 weeks.Some of these symptoms may include:


Weakness.
Numbness.
Difficulty walking (especially on stairs).
Tingling.
Pain.
Fainting spells (while standing up).
Burning in the extremities
Sudden onset of back and/or neck pain that radiates through the limbs.
Dizziness.
Difficulty breathing.
Bowel and bladder problems.
Nausea.
Eye twitching (ranging from mild to severe).
Twitching or shaking in other parts of the body.
 CIDP can only be diagnosed by a medical professional. If you have been experiencing any of these symptoms, contact your doctor. Your doctor or neurologists will want to run a series of tests.These may include:


Physical examination.
Electrodiagnostics tests (EMG or NCS).
Blood tests.
Urine tests.

 Use standard, heavy scissors to cut off the lower hem of your shorts, somewhere above the straight seam holding the hem in place.


If you cut below the hem seam, you will limit the amount of fraying, which you do not want to do for this method.
This initial cut should be parallel to the current bottom edge of your shorts.
Use straight scissors instead of pinking shears to maximizing the amount of fraying.
 Use the tip of your scissors to tug down on the loose edges at the newly cut raw edge of your shorts.


Work the scissors all the way around the perimeter of each leg.
This stem helps draw out the frayed fibers along the raw edge of the material.



Each series of cuts should be between 1 and 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) in length. Cut half a dozen to a dozen cuts in each series.
The shorts should be spread out on a flat surface when you do this.
Be sure not to cut through the pockets as you do this.
 Place the shorts in a washing machine and run a standard wash cycle, with or without detergent. Regardless of how long the cycle is or what water temperature you use, you should choose a wash with at least one spin cycle.


A spin cycle agitates the material, causing the raw edges to fray more.
Wash the shorts in the machine alone to maximize the amount of fraying that occurs.
The shorts can be dried by machine or by air.
 For maximum fraying, do not attempt to slow the fraying down or hold it in place. Just know that, as the shorts continue to fray with time and wear, they will gradually become shorter and shorter.

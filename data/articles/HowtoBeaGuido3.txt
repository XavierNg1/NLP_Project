 If you plan to go to a party as a guido, you need to be sure not to offend anyone. However you dress up and act, make sure nobody feels offended or disrespected. Guido themed parties and costumes are popular and typically don’t cross boundaries.


If you are confronted by someone offended, back down from the outfit and apologize.
 If you don’t want to cut your hair or expose it to strong chemicals, invest in a black wig. Once you have the wig, you can style it the same way you would as if it were your own hair. Use the aforementioned styles like the fohawk, blowout, or spiker.
 Search your wardrobe for slim fitting t-shirts or button down dress shirts. Go to a thrift store or secondhand clothing store to look for graphic print t-shirts. While you’re at the clothing store see if you can find any gold necklaces you could use for your costume.
 To easily convey a fake tan, wear a topical tanning cream on your face. You can also use a darker shade of foundation to your face. If you feel like going all out, purchase a temporary spray on tan.

 Fill a medium saucepan about â…” of the way full with water. Bring it to a boil over medium high-heat. Once it boils, add your farro. Let it boil for about 15 minutes, or until the farro becomes chewy and tender. Then drain the water from the farro with a strainer., Peel your shrimp and remove the veins while the farro cooks. Then peel and mince your garlic. Do the same with your ginger. Chop your scallions., Add the vegetable oil to a large skillet. Turn the burner to medium-high heat. Once the oil heats up, dump your garlic and ginger in and stir them around for a few seconds, until they become fragrant. Then place your shrimp in the skillet and cook them for two to three minutes, flipping occasionally., Place the farro in the skillet with the shrimp and stir them together. Add the soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice vinegar. Stir everything together until hot., Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer. Crack each egg open into a separate measuring cup and lower them into the water, one after the other. Simmer for about four to five minutes, then scoop them out of the water with a slotted spoon., Divide the farro equally between four plates. Switch shrimps from plate to plate if necessary for equal portions. Garnish with scallions. Then top each plate with a poached egg and serve.Store any leftovers in an airtight container within two hours of cooking and refrigerate. They should last between three or four days. Freezing them may make them last longer, but will ruin the eggs' texture.

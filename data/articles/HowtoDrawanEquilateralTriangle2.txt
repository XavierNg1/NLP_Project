 Use almost any cylindrical object with a circular base, like a bottle or a soup can. Try using a circular roll of tape or a CD. If you are going to substitute the arc of this object for the arc of a compass tracer, you'll need to choose an object of the right size. In this method, each side of the equilateral triangle will be as long as the radius (half the diameter) of the circular object.


If you use a CD as your object: imagine an equilateral triangle that fits into the top-right quadrant of a CD.
 It should be exactly as long as the radius of the circular object â€“ the distance halfway across. Make sure that it is perfectly straight!


If you have a ruler: simply measure the diameter of the object and draw a line that is half as long.
If you don't have a ruler: place the circular object onto a sheet of paper, then carefully trace the circumference with your pencil. Remove the object, and you should have a perfect circle. Use a straight edge to draw a line across the exact center of the circle: the point that is completely equidistant from any point around the circumference of the circle.
 Place the object over the line segment, with the edge of the circle resting at one end of the line. For accuracy, make sure that the line cleaves through the exact center of the circle. Use your pencil to trace an arc: roughly one-quarter of the way around the perimeter of the circle., Now, shift the circular object so that the edge touches the other end of the line segment. Make sure that the line segment runs through the exact center of the circle. Draw another quarter-arc that crosses the first arc at a point directly above the line segment. This point is the apex of your triangle.
 Draw the remaining sides of the triangle: two more straight lines will connect the apex with the two open ends of the line segment. Now, you should have a perfectly equilateral triangle!

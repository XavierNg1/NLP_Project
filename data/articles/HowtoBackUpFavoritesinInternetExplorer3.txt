 Simply click the "Start" menu and then select "Internet Explorer." You may also find this browser elsewhere if you've stored it on your desktop or Taskbar.
 Click the Favorites icon in the upper, righthand corner. It will look like a star., Begin by clicking the downward pointing arrow next to "Add to favorites." Alternatively, you may simply press Alt+Z on your keyboard. Finally, select "Import and export" from the menu that appears.
 Select "Export to a file" on the "Import and export" window and then click "Next." Check the box next to "Favorites" and then click "Next" again. Finally, choose the folder(s) of Favorites you wish to export or—if you wish to export them all—leave the entire Favorites folder selected. When satisfied, click "Next" once more.
 First, click the "Browse" button. Then select a file or drive in which you wish your Favorites to be exported. Upon deciding on a location, click the "Export" button and then click "Finish." This new location will serve as a backup for your Favorites without affecting the file that you've had exported.

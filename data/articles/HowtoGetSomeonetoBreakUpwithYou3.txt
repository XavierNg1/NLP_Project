 This will likely only lead to confused feelings and emotions on both sides, and will erode any finality the breakup may have had., Some people may prefer to completely cut themselves off from their partner to recover from a break up, but over time, you might find you are comfortable enough to reconnect with your former partner.


Only do this once a significant period of time has passed and you feel you have moved on from the relationship, even if you were the one who did the breaking up.
 The violence you experienced with your partner could continue after you have broken up or take the form of stalking or harassment.Avoid communicating with the person and state clearly only once via email or text that you want no further contact with them and any you have will be regarded as harassment.
Keep a record of any unwanted contact, but do not reply. Call the police if there is repeated contact or direct threats.

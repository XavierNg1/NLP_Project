 While Android does not have "built-in" support for reading PDF files, there are a large number of free apps that will easily open your PDF files. You may even have one of these already installed:


Google Drive
Quickoffice
Adobe Reader
Foxit MobilePDF

, Typically, when you download a PDF file, you can open it from your Notification bar by tapping the completed download. If you need to open the PDF file later, you can do so from your Downloads folder.


Open the "My Files" or "File Manager" app on your device. If you don't have a file manager, you can download one for free fro the Google Play store.
Open the Downloads folder. This is the default location that any downloaded files will be stored in.
Tap the PDF file to open it. If you've chosen a default app, it will open automatically. If you just installed an app to open PDF files, or you have more than one app installed that can read PDFs, you will be prompted to choose the app you want to use.
 There are a couple of different things that could be causing this problem.


Try using a File Manager app to open your downloaded file. You can find it in your Downloads folder. If you can open the file using a File Manager, you'll want to reset your browser.
Reset your browser by opening your Settings app, selecting "Apps" or "Applications", finding your browser in the list of apps, and then tapping the "Clear data" button.
 if your PDF is trying to open in an app that doesn't support PDFs, you may have the default app set wrong.


Open the Settings app.
Select "Apps" or "Applications".
Select the app that attempts to open your PDF files.
In the "Launch by Default" section, tap "Clear defaults".
Try opening the PDF file again. You should be prompted to select the app you want to use.

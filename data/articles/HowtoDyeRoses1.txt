 Dye will show up the best on white roses. If you use colored roses, the dye will add to whatever color is already there. For example, if you try to dye a yellow rose blue, you will get green.;
, Hold the stem under water as you cut it down to 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.5 centimeters). Cutting the stem at an angle will prevent it from sitting flat against the bottom of the cup. Cutting it under water will prevent air bubbles from forming. Both of these will help the rose absorb the dye better.Take this time to trim off any thorns and leaves as well.
Cut the stems shorter if you want the roses to soak up the dye faster. This will also help the roses turn out brighter., Leave the rose in the water as you prepare the dye bath. If you want to make a bouquet, you can cut more roses. Work one rose at a time, and place it into the vase as you finish cutting it., Fill a cup with Â½ cup (120 milliliters) of warm water. Stir in 20 to 30 drops of food coloring or liquid watercolor.If you want something more subtle, use 5 to 10 drops and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water instead., This will take at least 4 hours, so be patient! The longer you wait, the deeper the color will become. After 4 hours or so, the rose will take on a pastel color. If you want it to be a deeper color, you will have to wait 1 to 2 days. Keep in mind that the roses will be streaky and speckled.Rose petals will have small veins. They will look darker after you finish dyeing the rose. If this bothers you, leave the rose in the dye longer.For an interesting effect, dye the rose in one color for about 3 hours, then put it in a different color for 2 hours, then a third color for 1 hour., Once the rose is the color you want it to be, take the rose out of the dye, and place it into a vase filled with fresh water. If you want to help the rose last longer, add some floral preservative into the water.

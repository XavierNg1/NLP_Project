 Cover the bottom of the pot with a few inches of water—the steamer basket or sieve must fit snugly inside the pot and should not touch the water. Place the pot on a burner over medium heat. Allow the water to come to a simmer.


To check the water level, insert the steamer basket or sieve into the pan before bringing the water to a boil. If the water level is too high, pour out some water.
You must use at least 1 cup water., Once the water comes to a simmer, place the steamer insert or sieve over the water. Pour the frozen broccoli into the steamer. Cover the pot with a lid., Steam the frozen broccoli for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the lid and use a fork to assess the vegetable’s tenderness. If the broccoli is tender, turn off the burner and remove the pot from the heat.


If the broccoli is not tender, recover the pot and steam for 1 more minute., Remove the lid and set it to the side. Use hot pads or cooking mitts to take the steamer basket or sieve out of the pot of simmering water. Transfer the broccoli into a serving dish. Season to taste and serve.

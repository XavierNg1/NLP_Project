 Since time is the greatest constraint for any software tester the tester should be capable enough to give sufficient coverage to all areas of the application or software in no time.;
, Sometimes even when a defect is fixed the software functionality will not perform as intended. It happens when the developer has fixed only the secondary issues and not the root cause of the defect. So, first find the causative factors and fix it.
 In certain cases when a developer fixes a bug it might create new bugs that may go unnoticed. So when doing regression test the tester should be vigilant and alert.
 While doing regression test take into consideration only those issues that affect the functionality of the application or software. Though design aspects are also equally important but it is always better not to waste time on it.
 It is always good to create a regression test suite that will expose the bug whenever the application or software is retested.

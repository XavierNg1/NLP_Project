 Water marbling is a creative technique that uses water and a variety of colors for a unique look. Get the following materials ready: A basecoat and two or three colors that blend well together, like light blue, yellow and white. A shallow, wide-mouthed cup or bowl filled almost to the brim with room temperature water. Petroleum jelly.
 Allow it to dry completely.
 Drop some polish into the water from a low height. Notice how it creates a circle of color within the water.
 Continue adding drops in the same way, at the center of the circle of color, alternating the colors until you see a bulls-eye shape.
 Insert it in the water and drag it through the bulls-eye of color to create patterns. Spiderweb designs are popular, as are flower designs and geometric shapes. Don't go too far with the toothpick; if you blend the colors too much they won't be distinct from one another. If you create something with the toothpick and you don't like it, simply discard your first attempt and start over from the beginning.
 Spread petroleum jelly on the skin around your nails and onto your fingers. Carefully place your nails against the design that you created and then submerge them slightly. Remove water from the nails. Blow off any water droplets and use a cotton swab or cotton ball (coated with acetone if necessary) to clean up the edges and remove polish from your fingers.
 Finish with a clear topcoat.

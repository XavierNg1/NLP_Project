 Parenting skills, like any other ability, can be learned. Taking parenting classes can help you learn what you’ll need to know and do as you prepare for the arrival of a newborn. Most classes cover changing diapers, bathing, burping, and feeding your baby, among other skills.For a unique bonding experience, attend these classes with your partner.;
, Books that offer advice to expectant parents (and, especially, books targeted specifically towards men) can offer valuable insights and information. Many of these books are available at your local library, though you could of course buy them, too., When your partner goes to the doctor for checkups and ultrasounds, tag along. Listen to the doctor’s advice. Write down information about what the birth process will entail and how you can prepare for the newborn’s arrival., Talk to your partner about where they want you to be during labor. Some expectant mothers want their partners in the birthing room during labor. Others expect their partner to remain outside. There is no right way for a couple to plan this experience, but you should discuss the options together and come to an agreement.If you’re invited into the birthing room, you’ll probably just be there to squeeze your partner’s hand and offer moral support.

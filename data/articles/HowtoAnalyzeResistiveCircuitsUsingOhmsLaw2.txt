 Voltage is defined as the difference in charge between one point and another point and is measured in volts, designated “V.” It is often conceptualized by picturing a full tank of water and an empty tank connected by a hose. The full tank of water is at a high pressure, and the empty tank at a low pressure. The difference in water pressure is a similar concept to the difference in charge between the two terminals of a circuit., When there is a difference in charge between two points, you will have current. This is is the movement of charge from a point of high charge to a point of low charge and is measured in amperes, shown as “A.” A good analogy is that of a full tank of water attached to an empty tank by a hose. Water will flow from the full tank (high pressure) to the empty tank (low pressure), just as current moves from a point of high charge (source) to a point of low charge (ground)., Resistance is a property inherent of the material through which current is flowing. It is different for different materials, and is measured in Ohms, designated “ohms”. Resistance describes the degree to which the material inhibits current moving through it. High resistance will impede current more, and low resistance will impede the current less.

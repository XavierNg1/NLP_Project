 If you only have a handful of coupons, you can carry them alongside your grocery list in your hand. If you have a few more than that, you can place the coupons you plan on using in a separate bag or envelop and stick it in your purse or pocket.
 You may not intend to use that pasta coupon this week, but if you get to the store and see a sale running that would increase you savings, you may change your mind. Keep your entire stock available nearby, like in your car or purse. Do not attempt to carry all your coupons out at once, however, since doing so may overwhelm you and cause the process to drag on.
 Look through your grocery store’s advertisements to find out what sales they have going. If you have coupons for any of the sale products, now is your best chance to use them.
 You might have enough duplicate coupons to clear an entire shelf of a certain product, and you may be able to do so for free, but that does not necessarily mean that you should. If you have no intention of using that product or if there is no humanly way to consume it before the expiration date passes, do not buy that much of it. Only purchase what you intend to use. Otherwise, you deprive other customers of that product for no good reason and risk cluttering up your home with useless products.
 Not every store will accept every coupon. Restrictions on Internet coupons are the most common. Some stores also set limits on the number of coupons you can use. Others have very friendly coupon policies and may even double the value of the coupon or accept competitor's coupons.
 Make a check-mark, “x,” or “c” next to each item on your grocery list that you plan on using a coupon with. Doing so makes it easier for you to keep track of whether or not you have used all your intended coupons.
 Even with a coupon, some brands may be more expensive than their competitor’s. Do not be afraid to forego the coupon if you find a better deal that exists even without coupons.

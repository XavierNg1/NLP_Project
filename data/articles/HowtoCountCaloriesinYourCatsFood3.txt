 Once you have determined the number of calories your cat needs to eat each day and the number of calories within its food, you can calculate how much food to feed your cat each day. For example, if your cat needs 400 calories per day and you are feeding your cat a dry food that contains 200 calories per cup, then you would need to feed your cat two cups of food per day.You could divide this up into two meals or allow your cat to graze all day and only provide a maximum of two cups of food.
 You should also take into consideration the calories contained in any treats that you give your cat. For example, if your cat eats 50 calories worth of treats each day, then you need to reduce the amount of calories they receive through their regular meals.For example, if your cat needs 200 calories per day and they eat 50 calories in treats, they would have 150 calories left to receive from food. If their food contains 100 calories per cup then they would need 1.5 cups of food each day.
 You will likely need to change the amount of food you give your cat throughout their lifespan. This is because their activity level and metabolism may change as they age. Monitor your cat's weight and adjust their caloric intake accordingly. For example, if your cat begins to gain weight, you may need to start feeding them less calories each day. Similarly, if they start losing weight begin feeding them more calories.Calculate their caloric needs by using their desired weight instead of their actual weight. This will help you determine the exact amount you should be feeding them.

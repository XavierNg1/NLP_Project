 Place the saucepan on a burner set on medium-low. Add 2 tablespoons of chopped onion and saut√© until the onion is golden, about three to five minutes.
 Stir just until the jasmine rice is coated.
 Turn the heat to medium and bring the mixture to a simmer. Return the heat to low, then allow the mixture with the saucepan uncovered until the water has been completely absorbed.
 Cover the saucepan and allow the jasmine rice pilaf to set for 35 to 40 minutes.

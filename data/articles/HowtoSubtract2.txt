 A problem such as 15 - 9 will need a different visualization technique than a problem like 2 - 30.


In the problem 15 - 9, the first number, 15, is larger than the second, 9.
In the problem 2 - 30, the second number, 30, is larger than the first, 2.
 If the first number is larger, the answer is positive. If the second number is larger, the answer will be negative.


In the first problem, 15 - 9, your answer will be positive because the first number is larger than the second.
In the second problem, 2 - 30, your answer will be negative because the second number is larger than the first.
 In order to subtract the two numbers, you'll have to visualize the gap between the two numbers and count the numbers in between.


For the problem 15 - 9, visualize a pile of 15 poker chips. Remove 9 of them and you'll see that 6 of them remain. Therefore, 15 - 9 = 6. You can also think of a number line. Think of the numbers from 1 to 15 and then remove or go back 9 units to get 6.
For the problem 2 - 30, the easiest thing to do is to reverse the numbers and then make the answer negative after you've subtracted them. So, 30 - 2 = 28, since 28 is just two less than 30. Now, make your answer negative since you determined at the beginning that it would be negative because the second number is larger than the first. Therefore, 2 - 30 = -28.

 Animals have rights and you should respect them. Vegetarianism and veganism are also very good for the environment. Meat takes up a lot of resources. It also may improve your health.
 Unless it says "not tested on animals" it is almost certainly tested on animals. Even if it says that, it may still be tested on animals. Make sure it is certified cruelty free and check the ingredients to make sure they are vegan. Try to buy nontoxic makeup because there is some disturbing stuff in there. Try using the Cosmetic Database from Safe Cosmetics to know what makeup is the best and the worst.
 Try to avoid both leather and pleather and stick with alternative materials. Both leather and pleather have negative impacts on the environment. You should aim for buying sweat shop free shoes such as Ethletic or Black Spot brands. Black Spot also supports Adbusters, a magazine that works against consumerism.
, Additionally, wearing leather or very realistic leather substitutes could encourage more people to wear leather as people do have quite a strong herd instinct. However, very durable shoes will mean you don't have to buy as often.
 As said, both leather and pleather have negative impacts on the environment so try a cloth or hemp belt. Bullet belts made from real bullets is also good because it is recycling but it may come off as supporting militarism.
 You can also find recycled belts on Etsy but most of them are made of leather but some are not.
 Try to get fair trade and recycled accessories.
 All hair dyes, with the exception of truly natural ones such as henna and indigo, contain chemicals that will hurt the water system.


For red, you can dye your hair with henna but it will not lighten your hair and will only give you a vibrant red color your hair is light already.
For black, you can dye your hair with indigo over henna which will give it a color that could be blue black, jet black, purple black or burgundy black. It depends on your natural hair color.

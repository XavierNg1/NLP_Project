 You have to get permission. Whether it's from your parents/guardian or the child's parent/guardian, you need permission.;
, After you find a child to babysit, have the parent of that child get your phone number, house number, or any number that they can contact you with.
 Make sure you have a way of getting to the child's house. Whether it's walking, or driving make sure that you get there on time so that the parent will not miss the important thing that they have to do that day.
 Make sure the child has games/ or you can bring games for them to play with. You want the child to have a good time so that the parent is satisfied and may ask you to babysit again.
 To be safe, keep any sharp or dangerous objects away from the child, and before the parent leaves, ask for any emergency numbers that you can call if something does happen.
 Before you start your babysitting experience with the child, make you tell them the rules so that your experience with that child is not bad.
 Make sure you spend time with the child to make sure he is happy that you are his babysitter. Sometimes the parents have cameras in the house, so don't do anything bad. If the parents see that you like the child and the child likes you, they might pay you extra.

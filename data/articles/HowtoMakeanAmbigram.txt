 You can use mixed cases, but it looks nicer when they are all the same. For this guide, we'll make the word "wikiHow" into an ambigram.;
, Beneath your word, spell out it out with the letters in backwards order as in the picture below.
 Now that you have the words written out, you can see which letters you'll need to pair. In this case, we'll pair "W" and "W," "I" and "O," "K" and "H," and "I" and "I." Work with one pair at a time in the next steps.


In some cases, the two letters in the pair will be the same, such as the "I" in wikiHow, or every letter in a palindrome (see Tips). This usually makes the ambigram easier to construct and gives you a stable point to build around.
 Decide whether working in upper or lowercase will give you more flexibility.
 If you wrote the letter on paper, you can just turn the page so that the letter is upside-down. If you're on a computer, there may be an option to rotate 180 degrees clockwise, or you can flip horizontally and then flip vertically.
 For example, to make a rotated "I" look like an "O," you can turn the line into an elongated circle. Leave the dot; when the "O" is readable, it will look decorative, but it will make it recognizable as an "I".
 What you should be left with is an image that looks like one letter in the pair, but when you rotate it 180 degrees, it looks like the other letter in the pair.
 Put the new letters together to form the ambigram.
 If this is too difficult, there are a couple of ambigram generators on the internet (such as FlipScript) that can do this for you.

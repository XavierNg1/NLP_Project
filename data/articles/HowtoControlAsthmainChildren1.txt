Dust in the carpet can be a huge problem for children who have asthma. Make sure to keep your carpet clean or install hardwood floors to help solve this problem. Hardwoods can be an added cost, but the expense will be well worth it in the long run.






Another common allergen that can become a problem for your child is pollen. This one is hard to avoid, but you can help your child by limiting outside time during heavy pollen seasons. Keep windows shut when pollen count is high.






Be sure to change air filters often. Regardless of the asthma trigger, maintaining pure air in the home is one of the most effective ways to reduce airborne triggers. Consider purchasing a HEPA filter that helps purifier air and maintain higher air quality in the home. Always make sure heating ducts and air conditioner vents are well cleaned and properly ventilated.

If you smoke, don’t smoke in the house or around your child. Cigarette smoke is a very strong trigger for an asthma attack. Even if a child does not have asthma, parents should avoid smoking as second hand smoke is a known carcinogen. Children who are exposed to second hand smoke are more likely to develop asthma later on.






Most parents know that second hand smoke is dangerous to their child’s lungs, however, many parents are unaware that common household items and toiletries can also have the same damaging effect. The chemicals used to create the scents in those common items can irritate the lungs, especially in children.
 While there is not much you can do to control the weather, knowing which season causes asthma in your child can help you to keep her condition better under control. If your child tends to have more asthma problems during the winter because of the cold air, try to limit the time your child spends outside during the cool winter months. The same thing applies for other seasons.

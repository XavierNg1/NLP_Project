 Place ¼ of a ripe avocado in a small bowl. Use a fork to mash the fruit until it has a smooth, creamy consistency with no lumps.Avocado has plenty of healthy fats that help moisturize, soften, and smooth the skin.
You can use a food processor to mash the avocado if you prefer.
 Once the avocado is mashed, add 1 egg yolk and 1 teaspoon (5 g) of yogurt. Stir all of the ingredients together until they’re fully combined in a smooth paste.It’s usually easier to stir the mask together with a fork rather than a spoon.
 When the mask is completely mixed, use clean fingers to apply it your face. Massage it into your skin using circular, upward motions. Let the mask sit for 15 minutes or until it dries completely.You can apply the mask with a brush if you prefer. For best results, however, brush it on in an upwards direction.
 When the mask is dry, wash it off with warm water. Pat your face dry with a clean towel, and follow up with your usual moisturizer or serum.

 Choose your tour, and see if friends or family also want to go. If others plan to come, make sure you list your rooming preference on your application; usually, there are 2 people to a room.
 Many travel companies allow you to pay in monthly installments, which can make an expensive tour much more affordable. If you are retired, and you are on a pension, try to choose a tour at least 1 year in advance.
 These include air fuel surcharges, tipping for tour directors or bus drivers, spending money, transportation fees, airport transfers and more. Each company has a different policy about these fees; some companies include some fees in their quote and others do not.
 If there are any medical, family or other problems that could keep you from traveling on your tour, you should sign up for a cancellation policy. It will require a higher fee, but you will usually receive a refund of the base cost of your trip.
 This will hold your space on the trip. Most companies require $500 or more to reserve your place, with part of that sum being non-refundable if you cancel.
 Check into the billing procedure and keep the customer service/billing number close at hand, in case you have questions. Ask if there are any additional fees for paying by credit card.


Realize that most tour companies have a final payment deadline between 45 and 90 days prior to your departure date. This is to guarantee all your services, especially airfare. You risk losing your money if you cancel after this point. It is also the reason to sign up for a tour well in advance.

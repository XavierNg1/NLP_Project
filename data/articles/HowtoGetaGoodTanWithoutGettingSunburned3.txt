 Apply your tanning mousse or gel immediately after you prep your skin to ensure the smoothest coat possible.



Make sure that the product is formulated to work with DHA, which is the active ingredient in most self-tanners.
The moisturizer will do double-duty for you by providing coverage for spots you may miss when you apply mousse or gel.
 Working this way will keep you from creasing your skin when you bend over to apply the self-tanner.
 You may need assistance applying a mousse or gel to your back and other hard-to-reach areas.

 You should always book an audition time unless otherwise specified. Most contact information for booking auditions will be either on the company's website or in a newspaper advertisement., Dress nicely for your audition. How you present yourself is key. Sometimes, you may wish to wear a costume. Help the casting crew to see you in the role, but don’t go so over the top that your costume takes away from your performance. Stay away from props., Most groups will tell you what they want you to do for the audition. Generally, they'll want a song that fits your voice range and age (always from a musical), and a short 1 or 2 minute monologue.
 Auditioning can be a nerve-racking experience for the first few times. There are different kinds of auditions.


There are open auditions. This is where you audition for everyone - the director, the music director, any other board members, and the other people auditioning.
There is also a closed audition where you are only auditioning for the director, and the music director.
 Every position is different and the director/producer have a specific image in mind. Go in. Do your best. If you don’t get it, most likely it isn’t anything you did.
 Be polite. Don’t be arrogant. Make good impressions. Just watch what you say and who you say it to. If they like your personality, they may think of you for a different part, perhaps, in a different production.


Do not get caught up in drama. Trash talking people in the theatre community will get you nowhere but a seat in the audience. Approach your experiences with an open mind and optimistic conscience. It will get you far.

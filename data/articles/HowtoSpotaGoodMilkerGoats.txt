 Is she well behaved and docile? This will make for a better milker than an agitated and nervous doe.


Look for an alert attitude. Check her tail â€“ if it's droopy, it can mean that something is wrong.;
, It should be soft, wide, and round.
 Symmetry is an important signal; are her teats all the same size?


Teats should not be so long that they drag on the ground. Check that they are sitting high enough and unlikely to get caught up in her legs when she walks.
 It should be well-rounded. This indicates that she is able to accommodate a lot of feed that is then turned into milk. She should also have a good appetite (the only time this diminishes in a healthy doe is during labor).


In conjunction with this, she should have no problems chewing, eating, and swallowing.
 She should have strong legs and not have difficulties walking. If she has a hunched back, this can indicate that she is unwell or that something is wrong.


Check her hoofs. Hoof rot can manifest itself in lameness, a stench, and black deterioration of the inner hoof., A good sign is a smooth coat with soft skin, with no bare patches in the coat.


If her coat is dull, she probably has parasites. Lice may be a problem if there is listlessness, weakness, and anemia.If her coat is fluffed up, this can mean that the doe is unwell., They should be clear and bright, indicating that she is not suffering from an illness.
 This should help give you an indication of the care that has been given to the goats.


Taste the milk from the herd and preferably from the doe you'd like to purchase.

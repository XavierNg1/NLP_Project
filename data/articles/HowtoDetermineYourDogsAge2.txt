 While conventional wisdom says you should multiply a dog's age by 7 to determine human years, dogs are well over 7-years-old by their first year. Most breeds of dogs are about 15-years-old in human years by the time they are one years old., By the time they are two, you can add nine additional years to your dog's age. Regardless of breed and size, most dogs are approximately 24 by the time they're two., As a general rule of thumb, you can add about five years to a dog's age for every subsequent year. By three, most dogs will be 28 in human years. By four, most dogs will be 32 in human years, and so on., Bigger breeds tend to age faster than normal breeds. While no one understand the precise reason for this, big dogs tend to have shorter lifespans. By around six, big to medium size breeds will age faster than smaller breeds. There is no precise gauge for determining a dog's human years, but most big breeds will be a few years older than small breeds.A Great Dane, for example, may start aging 10 to 12 years in human years after six as opposed to a smaller breed.At 8, a large breed like a Great Dane may be a considerably older than a smaller breed at 8.

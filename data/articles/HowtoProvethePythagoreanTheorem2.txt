 Sketch a trapezoid with the following measurements: left side of height b, right side of height a, and base of length a+b. Simply connect the tops of the left and right sides to complete the trapezoid.
 Divide the base of the triangle into lengths a and b so that two right triangles of lengths a, b, and c is formed. The third triangle will have two sides of length c and a hypotenuse of length d.The two smaller triangles are congruent (identical).
 The area of a trapezoid is: A = ½(b1 + b2)h where b1 is one straight side of the trapezoid, b2 is the other straight side of the trapezoid, and h is the height of the trapezoid.For this trapezoid: b1 is a, b2 is b, and h is a+b.


The area of this trapezoid is A = ½(a +b)(a+b) .

Expanding the binomial yields: A = ½(a2 + 2ab + b2).
 The area of a right triangle is: A = ½bh where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height. This trapezoid has been broken into three different triangles; therefore, the areas need to be added together. First, find the area of each one and then add all three together.


Because two of the triangles are identical, you can simply multiply the area of the first triangle by two: 2A1 = 2(½bh) = 2(½ab) = ab.
The area of the third triangle is A2 = ½bh = ½c*c = ½c2.
The total area of the trapezoid is A1 + A2 = ab + ½c2.
 Because both of these calculations are equal to the total area of the trapezoid, you can set them equal to each other. Once they’re set equal to each other, you can reduce the equation to its simplest form.½(a2 + 2ab + b2) = ab + ½c2.
Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the ½: (a2 + 2ab + b2) = 2ab + c2.
Subtract out the 2ab: a2 + b2 = c2.
You’re left with the proof: a2 + b2 = c2.

 The vehicle you will be driving in must have a valid tag and be in good mechanical condition.
 The examiner will be evaluating the following skills:


Steering the vehicle and keeping it in the correct lane at all times.
Performing basic maneuvers, such as turning left and right, backing up and parking in different situations.
Using your turn signals appropriately and following right-of-way rules.
An awareness of other drivers and pedestrians and appropriately responding to potential hazards.
Knowing and adhering to traffic signs, signals and markings on the road.
 You'll need to wait at least 1 day to retake the test. If you fail 3 times, you'll need to wait 30 days to retake it.
 As of 2011, the license fee is $21.50 plus $4 for the application and $4 for each driving test retake.

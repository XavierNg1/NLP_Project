 As soon as you notice the spill, treat it with cloth or paper towels. Blot the outside edge of the stain first and work towards the center. This will keep the stain from spreading and setting., Most dirt and food stains will come off with a basic washing. You may try wiping up the stain with lukewarm water or a mixture of water and a squeeze of a mild soap. Make sure the sponge or cloth is damp rather than soaked, then wipe it from side to side across the leather.

A leather cleaner is a useful alternative. It will protect the leather and prevent the stain from setting.
 For stubborn marks, such as scuff marks or scratches, try acetone. Dampen a cotton ball or swab in nail polish remover. Rub the acetone into the mark with circular motions.

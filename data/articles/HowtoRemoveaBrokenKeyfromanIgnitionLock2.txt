 Insert the tip of the pliers into the keyhole and then open them to spread the keyhole opening. There is no need to do this unless the broken piece of key is stuck, as it can damage your ignition lock/keyhole. Opening the keyhole will provide a clear path for removing the piece.
 Once you have opened the keyhole, slide the pliers as far as you can into the lock and attempt to grasp the key fragment with them. If the pliers will not fit far enough into the opening to grasp they key then you can attempt to use wire or tweezers.
 Once you have a hold of the broken piece of key, pull it straight out of the opening. Now you can use a spare or have a new key cut.

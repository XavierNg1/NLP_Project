 You'll need a single chopstick, sandpaper, and something to sharpen the wood. A hand-operated pencil sharpener is the easiest way, but you could also whittle the tip with a sharp knife if you don't have a pencil sharpener.


Try not to use an electric pencil sharpener--it may break.
 Sharpen it less than you would a pencil--you want it to look more like a blunt pencil tip.
 A sharp tip may damage your touch screen (or you). Rub the tip with the sandpaper until it is blunt. It should not be painful if you press it into your skin.


Sand any rough edges of the chopstick as well so you don't get splinters.
 A few layers of tape wrapped around the stylus may make it more comfortable to hold.









Remember: this stylus will not work on an iPhone, Android, Kindle Fire, or other device with a capacitive screen.

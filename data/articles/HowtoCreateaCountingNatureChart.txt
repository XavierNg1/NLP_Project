 Ask the children to collect as many small natural items as possible. These items could include: acorns, leaves, pebbles, grasses, twigs, nuts, plant matter (such as fluff surrounding seeds, buds etc.), animal fur tufts (often caught on prickly plants/fences etc.), flowers, seeds, feathers, nuts and so on. It is important to collect "lots" of some of the items so that you will have enough to create numbers 1 - 10 on your chart. The easier things to collect more of include: leaves, pebbles and seeds.
 Sort out the nature items into groups, so that it will be easier to count them. Clean any dirty items and allow these to dry., Take a big sheet of cardboard and place it so that the width is facing you for drawing on. Using a marker, draw a table that has two columns: Column 1 should only be wide enough for the numbers; column 2 should cover the remaining width of the cardboard piece., Draw 10 rows (or as many or as few as you'd prefer). Number from 1 - 10., Glue on the correct amount of nature items next to the numbers. This helps the child to learn the numbers and associate them with the number of items. For example: 1 feather, 2 flowers, 3 shells, 4 acorns, 5 leaves, 6 pieces of fur etc., Once the glue has dried and you are sure nothing can fall off, hang the chart up on a wall where the child can see it and practise counting every day for a short time.

 Use two cups of epsom salts, two cups of borax, Â½ a cup of kaolin clay powder, and essential oils of your choice. The kaolin clay and borax work together to soften the water and your skin, as well as to provide other mineral health benefits including muscle relaxation and reduced tension.
 Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl and stir completely. Slowly add in your essential oils to your desired scent amount, making sure to incorporate it with all of the mixture.
 Keep your finished bath salts stored in a large, sealed container between uses. Sprinkle a few tablespoons into your bathwater and let it soothe your stress away. Enjoy!

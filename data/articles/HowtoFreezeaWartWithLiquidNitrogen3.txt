 Liquid nitrogen should not be used at home, since it can cause tissue damage if you apply it incorrectly. If you want to treat your wart at home, use a different method.


Freezing with liquid nitrogen is poorly tolerated in young children due to pain and discomfort.
Liquid nitrogen must be used carefully to avoid nerve damage and neuropathy.
Never use liquid nitrogen the face. Use it cautiously when treating dark pigmented skin colors so as not to cause discoloration of the skin.
 The doctor will pour a small amount of liquid nitrogen into a polystyrene cup. This keeps the liquid nitrogen sanitary, especially if several people are using it. A cotton swab is then soaked in the substance and applied to the wart. The swab should be applied directly to the middle of the wart with light pressure. This is repeated until a frozen zone appears. It should be white in color. The doctor will gradually apply more pressure to finish freezing the wart.


EMLA cream may be used to decrease pain and discomfort.
The frozen tissue will become hard, and if you pinch from the sides you will feel that there is frozen tissue between your fingers.
 While the wart should be mostly white, the color will slowly return. If you think it may not have been frozen deeply enough, you can repeat the process. There will be some minor spikes of cold pain.


Major pain is a sign that healthy skin has been damaged by the liquid nitrogen.

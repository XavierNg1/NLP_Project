 A good 10 to 30 minute soak should help soften the paper or vinyl of the sticker and make it easy to remove with your fingers.


The water and soap helps dissolve the glue and break its bond with the glass.
If you can't soak your glass object in water, soak a hot wet washcloth or sponge and dampen the sticker area.
 Use your fingers to gently lift the sticker off or use a dull knife to scrape off the sticker by gently prying a corner of the sticker off, then wedging the blade between the sticker and glass until it is completely removed.


Be sure to pick a knife that is dull and not sharp to touch. Dull knives have been through wear and tear so when you use it on a glass surface, you won't run the risk of scratching the surface.
Alternatively, you can purchase a razor scraper that is designed to remove adhesives off surfaces.
In some cases, the sticker might come off very nicely after being treated with soap and hot water.
 It's a great universal cleaning agent that lifts and dissolves dirt and grease.Adding oil to it makes it into a paste for easy application on any surface.


Any cooking oil will work. You can use olive oil, canola oil, or vegetable oil.
 Cover these surfaces with cloth or paper and tape them up with masking tape to seal them off from paste leakages.


Surfaces you want to protect from include plastic, painted surfaces, wood, or fabric.
Baking soda is relatively safe so if you do accidentally drop paste on an unwanted surface or your skin, there should be little to no damage if you clean it off right away.
 Leave this on for a few minutes and let the baking soda do its magic.


For very stubborn stickers, leave the paste on overnight.
 The residue glue and paper should have softened enough for you to wipe or scrub away the sticker clean.


Alternatively, you can use an abrasive cloth or sponge like steel wool to give extra scrubbing strength. However, be careful not to scratch the glass surface.

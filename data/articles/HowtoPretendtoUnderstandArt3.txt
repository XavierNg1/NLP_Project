 If you can't think of anything to say in conversation about art, ask others what they think. This takes the attention off of you and is a good conversational practice (you should interest in other people you're speaking to).Really pay attention to what others are saying. It's good manners and they might say something that gives you an idea for your own contribution to the conversation.
 If possible, draw comparisons between the art you're looking at and/or discussing and a topic you're more comfortable with. It gives you the chance to speak about something you're more comfortable with. It can also make you look like you understand art even more, because you can connect it to other things.For example, maybe you're an avid reader and you have a favorite author. Does any of the artwork you're discussing remind you of the way you've imagined a scene in a book? Share that.
 Sometimes you just might not be able to think of anything to say, and that's okay! You can say something like "I don't know much about that," or "I'm not really feeling it." Responding in a general way can also signal to other people that it's okay for them to talk a little more if they know more about the topic.

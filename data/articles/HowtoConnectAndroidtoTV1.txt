 Your phone's charging port--also known as a micro USB outlet--cannot support the same cable that interfaces with your TV by default, so you'll need to purchase a converter. You can do so by typing "micro USB to HDMI" into a search engine and selecting a pertinent option (e.g., something from Amazon).Make sure your device is compatible with your chosen cable before purchasing. You can do this by typing your device's name and the cable's name into a search engine and reviewing the results.
If you don't already have an HDMI cable, purchase one now. HDMI cables go for around $10 online.;
, This should fit into the charging port at the bottom of your phone., Your HDMI cable will fit in the opposite end of the converter., The roughly trapezoid-shaped HDMI port(s) should be on the back of your TV. HDMI ports usually have the word "HDMI" printed next to them.

Take note of which input is listed below the HDMI port (e.g., Video 3).
Your converter may come with a USB power cable. If your TV doesn't have a readily-available USB port near the HDMI port, you can plug the USB power cable into your Android charger unit.
, How you do this will depend on your TV model, but you can usually do so by pressing the "Input" button on the top or side of your TV.

If your HDMI port is "Video 3", for example, you'll need to change the TV's displayed input to "Video 3".
 If you don't see your Android's screen mirrored on your TV after a few seconds, you may have to restart your device.

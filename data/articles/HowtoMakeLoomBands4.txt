 You will need assorted loom bands in at least two colors, a plastic S-clip, a dinner fork (with four tines), and a pencil or chopstick. (Anything long, skinny, and slightly pointed will work.) This pattern is more complicated than the others, so take your time!

, The fork should be facing you. Pull the band back a little, twist it, and slide it over the second tine. Continue pulling, twisting, and looping over the remaining two tines. The band should make what looks like two "8"s on the fork.
 You can use a different color or the same, depending on how thick you want the stripes in the pattern to be.
 Pull it up and over the fork tine to the back. It should come over and across the top band and form a loop at the back of the fork.
 Pull it up and over the fork tine to the back. Repeat with the final two loops.
 You should have a row of what looks like "8"s on the fork again. Repeat Steps 4 and 5, using the pencil to pull the bottom band from the front up and over the fork to the back.
 Continue in the pattern, alternating between forming rows of "8" loops and pulling the bottom band over the fork tines. Create as many rows as necessary to make the bracelet your desired length.


Once you've gotten several rows finished, give the back of the bracelet a little pull. This will help keep the pattern tight and in place.
 When you pull the bracelet (which should be behind the fork), you should see two open loops where you began weaving. Slide one end of the S-clip through both loops.
 Make sure to pinch them at the bottom as you slide up so you don't lose them! Slip all four loops through the other end of the S-clip. Now your hexafish bracelet is finished!


Take your time with this step. If you slide the loops off too quickly, it could unravel the bracelet.

 Pour the olive oil into a skillet and heat it over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes.

The oil should be smooth and glossy but not so hot that it begins to steam.
 Cut the kohlrabi into very small pieces. Slice the bulbs into 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) thick slices, if not thinner, and chop each slice into even finer minced pieces.

For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger.
 Add the minced garlic to the hot oil and stir-fry for about 1 minute, just until it becomes fragrant and lightly toasted.

Watch the garlic carefully as you cook it. Garlic can burn easily, and if it burns, it could ruin the taste of the oil. You will need to toss the oil out and start from scratch if this happens.
 Transfer the minced kohlrabi to the hot oil and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until it becomes tender-crisp.

Do not let the kohlrabi remain still for too long. If you do so, you may end up causing them to burn.
 Season the kohlrabi with a dash of salt and stir well to coat evenly. Transfer the cooked kohlrabi onto individual serving platters and enjoy.

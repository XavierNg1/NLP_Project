 For a polished look, pair your low top sneakers with a skinny fit or a straight-legged cut. Other options will either engulf your shoes and obscure them completely, or create a frumpy look. Try to find a pair that allows your ankle bones to peek through between the bottom hems and the top of your shoes., Finding a pair of jeans that fall exactly at your ankle bone is no easy feat! If you can’t find a pair like this, cuff them so that your ankles are exposed. Your look will be streamlined and the focus will be on your shoes, so make sure your sneakers are ones that you want to show off.For a tight-to-the-ankle look, try pin rolling. Do this by folding in the inseam of your jeans until they’re hugging your ankles, and then cuff them two or three times., Low tops and jeans work best when the actual ankle is exposed, which means avoiding visible socks. Skip socks altogether and wear your sneakers on your bare feet. If this is uncomfortable for you, opt for low-riding ankle socks that don’t show when you’re wearing your sneakers.

No matter the weather – warm or cold – low tops with visible socks should generally be avoided., This look, first popularized in the ‘70s, is making a comeback. Make sure the flares fit you well through the hips and waist, only flaring out once they hit the calf area. For the ultimate retro throwback look, pair vintage (or vintage-style) sneakers with flares and a graphic tee.If you’re going for a more feminine look, skip the graphic tee and choose a loose-fitting off-the-shoulder top.

 Comfortable shoes are usually those that are well made and long lasting. While a cheap shoe may feel great when you first put it on, if it has a thin sole and poor supports, the initial sense of comfort will quickly wear off.;
, Changes do occur over time, so it's a good idea to have this done every now and then even after you've stopped growing.
 Just because a shoe is long enough doesn't mean it's wide enough.
 Assess the comfort of each one; some brands are likely to be more suited to your foot shape than others. Being strongly attached to a shoe style that hurts your foot isn't a wise option, so be open-minded about the possibilities.
 Shop when your feet are likely to be more swollen or tired from the day (late afternoon) so that you know the shoes feel good if they fit!

, Before heading out in shoes on long walks or days, wear them in at home in short spurts first.

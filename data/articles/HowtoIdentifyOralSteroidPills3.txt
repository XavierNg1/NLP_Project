 Another way to identify a pill that might be an oral steroid is to call the center for poison control. Their hotline is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.The CPC hotline can be reached at 1-800-222-1222. Call and describe the pill as best as you are able, including information about shape, color, and markings.
Their services are confidential and anonymous.
 There are also websites that allow you to simply send in a photograph of any pill you have found for identification. One such website is http://www.steroidabuse.com.A medical professional will look at the pill you have submitted and will respond as soon as possible via email to let you know what the pill is.
This service is particularly useful for identifying black-market steroids that might not appear in databases of legal or commercially available pills.
 A medical professional such as your doctor or pharmacist should be able to identify pills you have found and let you know whether they might be steroids.


If you have been unable to identify a pill using the methods described above and need to know what it, consult a medical professional.

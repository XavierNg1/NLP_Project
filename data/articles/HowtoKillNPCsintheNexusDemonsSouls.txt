 Baldwin drops the hands of god, a very powerful weapon. Thomas the ring of Herculean strength (nothing if you've already traded with him), Blue drops a soul worth 2,000, and the rest usually give you about 200 a piece.
 Each character is difficult in their own way. It will not be an easy fight, especially if you're new to the game. Gather your best shield, weapon, armor, long range weapon, spells, rings, and more. ], Equip the strongest long-range weapon you have. When you're as far away as possible hit them with multiple blasts, and begin backing away more. It will usually take anywhere from 3 or more hits for them to come after you.


Alternatively if you don't have a long range weapon. Walk up to them, and hit them with your weapon as many times as you can, and begin backing away.
Make sure to have a shield or use the roll/parry feature or you will die fairly quickly.
 Use your weapons, parry block, spells, etc to overcome them.
 This can be a good strategy if attacking them hasn't killed them. Now that they want to kill, they will follow you when they see you. Begin to walk up the stairs of the Nexus. (Make sure they are following, if they aren't walk closer and then begin moving again.) Once you reach the ledge, stop and get ready; they are close behind.


Hit them. Begin blasting them with attacks until they fall over the ledge. The fall will kill them, but make sure you don't fall as well. It won't make much of a difference but you will die.

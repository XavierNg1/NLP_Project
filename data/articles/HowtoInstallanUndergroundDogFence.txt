 Draw where you want the boundaries of your electric fence to be.;
, Be sure that it is at least 3 feet from objects such as water heaters as they may get in the way of receiving a strong signal from the wire. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, use the screws and hardware given by the manufacturer to mount the transmitter onto the wall.
 Go ahead and plug the transmitter into your electrical outlet and turn it on. A light will come on if you are connected with a circuit.
 It is not time to put it on your dog just yet.
 Look at the manufacturer’s instructions to make sure you have set it according to their recommendations.
 Hold the test light strip that was given to you with your kit up against the contact points on the dog’s collar. Walk over to the boundary wire, holding the collar at the same level as their pet’s neck. Listen for a beep or watch for it to light up as you enter the boundary zone. If the collar didn’t do this in located you wanted it to, turn the boundary dial knob to a different setting. Do this again, until the collar beeps where you want it to, closer or further away from the boundary wire.
 Push the wire down into the groove and cover the wire with dirt.
 These can be removed later, after your dog learns where his boundaries are.
 Fasten the collar around the dog’s neck, letting the metal contact points touch your dog’s skin. They should be centered underneath your pet’s neck. The collar should fit securely, but be loose enough to be able to insert your finger in between the contact points and your pet’s neck.

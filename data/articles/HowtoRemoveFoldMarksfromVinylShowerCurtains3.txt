 To use this method, you will first need to spread out the curtain on a flat, even surface, like a clean floor or a clean table top.You can work in sections if the shower curtain is very large and has many folds. You may use the squeegee on a section and once the folds are removed, shift the curtain so the new section lays on the flat surface.
 You can use a commercial squeegee made to clean windows from a hardware supply store or online. You can also use a flat piece of cardboard or a curved flattening tool, often used to crease and fold paper.Make sure the tool does not have any sharp edges or sections, as they could cut or damage the curtain.
 Use the squeegee or the flattening tool to remove the folds by pressing and pulling lightly over the folds. Hold the top section of the curtain or tape it to the surface so it stays in place as you press and pull the folds out of the curtain.Work through each fold carefully. You may need to press and pull with the squeegee over the fold several times to flatten it out. Once you have removed a fold from a section, move on to a new section until all the folds in the curtain have been removed.

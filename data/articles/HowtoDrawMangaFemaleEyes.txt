 Make sure you have a flat surface under your paper, otherwise your drawing might appear shaky and messy. If your work surface is rough, try placing a pile of paper under the sheet you're working on to create a smoother surface. Newspaper or a magazine will also work, although the ink from the newsprint might transfer to your drawing paper, so consider having an additional paper layer over the top of the newspaper.;
, Then draw a curved line over the top and on the bottom. This will form the main shape of the eye. Don't worry, your circle doesn't have to be perfect. It should really be more of an oval.


In manga, the female eye tends to be drawn rounder than the male eye, so the circular shape is very important.
 This will be a highlight.
 Just make sure that the highlight is on top, so that it obscures the top right part of the pupil. Shade the pupil in black.


The pupil shapes vary in manga, so find what works best for you but be sure to include the highlight. Sometimes artists have more than one highlight.
 You may want to use a thicker pencil for this step.
 Bear in mind that highlights make the character look more feminine and child-like.


Even though in real life, some males can have equally luscious eyelashes, when drawing the female eye, it is commonplace to emphasize the eyelashes by making them long and thick, as a sign of femininity.
Female manga eyes tend to have a lot of "shine" added to them in contrast to the duller male manga eye. Add some extra sparkle to the pupils if wished.
 Erase the pencil lines, again leaving the shading.
 Now try the eye facing the other way, so that you can put a pair of eyes together and continue with the rest of your female manga drawing.

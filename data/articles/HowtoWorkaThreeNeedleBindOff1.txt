 Before you begin the three needle bind off, line up your two needles. Make sure that both points are facing the same way.To make an invisible seam, the right sides of your knit work should be facing each other.;
, Insert the third needle through the first stitch on both needles. Then, loop the yarn over and pull the yarn through both stitches.Do this once more to create a second stitch. After the first stitch is bound off, you will only need to knit one stitch per sequence., Once you have two new stitches on the third needle, loop the first stitch over the second stitch. Then, knit through two stitches again and bind off another stitch.Continue to repeat the sequence until you have bound off all of the stitches on the needles.
 When you finish binding off all of the stitches, pull the last loop out a few inches and then cut it in the center. Then, pull the loose yarn out of the stitch and pull the tail to secure it.You can also use a darning needle to weave the end into the edge of your knitting project. Then tie te end to a stitch and cut it near the knot.

 Find a flat, rough rock or piece of concrete. Turn the can upside down and rub the raised rim against this hard, rough surface, pressing down slightly while you do.If the can contains only liquid, you can keep it upright, and use the tip of a spoon to rub against a small section of the outermost groove instead, touching the raised rim of the can top.;
, Eventually, the crimped edge of the can should come apart, leaking moisture through the hole you made. When you notice this happen, turn the can right side up again.
 Hold the can upright on a flat surface, and squeeze the sides with both hands.Do this gently at first, gradually squeezing harder, since popping the can lid out too vigorously could cut your finger.


Alternatively, whack the side of the can against a hard object. This is messier, but may keep your fingers safer.
Another option is to find the hole and pry it open with a spoon, screwdriver, or other tool, working your way around the rim. Do not use a knife, as it could easily slip and injure your hands.

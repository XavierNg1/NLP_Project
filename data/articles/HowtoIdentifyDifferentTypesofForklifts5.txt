 These are also known as Bendi or Flexi Forklifts, Articulated Forklifts are special types of forklifts which are articulated from the front end (wheels, mast, and forks) so that they are able to perform both duties of a counterbalance forklift (loading trucks) and a reach forklift (retrieve/put away stock in narrow aisles)., Generally similar in operation to standard counterbalance forklifts, the main difference is all terrain forklifts usually have large trodden tires, for use on all terrain ground, dirt, mud, grass, etc, where regular solid forklift tires would simply not operate on the ground - no traction, get "bogged", etc...All terrain forklifts are generally best identified by the large trodden tires and a similar appearance to a small tractor., A side loader, or multi-directional forklift, is a specialist type of forklift used mainly for the moving of long shaped loads, such as timber, piping, etc. Its main feature is it is able to be driven in different directions; for example, it can be driven sideways after retrieving a long load from an aisle - which greatly eases the process of getting long loads in and out of racking storage - as opposed to turning a full 90 degrees with standard forklifts, a maneuvering problem exacerbated by long shaped loads., Similar in design to reach stackers, telehandler forklifts are a specialist type of forklift common in the construction industry, the use of a boom with the forks and carriage on the end allows the handling of loads to places standard mast type forklifts cannot reach, for example on a rooftop, in the middle of a trailer, etc. Again with the boom extension care needs to be taken as lifting capacity can be reduced significantly

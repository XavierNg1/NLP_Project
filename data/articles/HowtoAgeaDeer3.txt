 A deer that has five or fewer teeth in its mouth is a fawn. Typically a deer will have four teeth if it's 5 to 6 months old and five teeth if it's 7 months old to one-year-old. Once the deer is over a year old, it will develop its sixth tooth., If the deer is under a year old, its third tooth will be a tricuspid, or have three cusps that form a single tooth. This tricuspid will look worn down until it falls out to be replaced by a permanent bicuspid, or a tooth that has two ridges., If the third tooth is bicuspid, it could still be a younger deer. If the coloring is lighter on its third tooth, or the tooth is just starting to develop, the deer is a little older than one year old. If the third tooth is the same color as the rest of the teeth, the deer could be anywhere between 2.5 years old to a fully matured deer., As a deer starts to age, the enamel on its teeth will start to wear away and the teeth will start to brown. Fully matured deer will have most of the enamel on their teeth worn away at this point. If the teeth look worn down, there's a good possibility the deer is over five years old.

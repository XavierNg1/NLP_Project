 Groupon has some limitations on how you can return Groupon vouchers. Make sure that your voucher qualifies for a refund, or your request will likely be denied.Groupon allows you to return un-redeemed vouchers for three days after the time of purchase. After three days, the sale is final.
If you used a voucher but were unhappy with the experience, you can contact Groupon to attempt to get a refund within 14 days of the voucher being redeemed.;
, Visit Groupon.com and log in with your Groupon account.
 This will open a list of all of the Groupons you've purchased and redeemed.
 Remember, you can only return Groupons within the first three days of purchase, and they can't have been redeemed.
 You can find this link on the left side of the screen, above the "Print Voucher" button. If you don't see the link, you're no longer eligible for a refund for that voucher.
 You'll find this link underneath the "Update Order" button.
 Use the drop-down menu to select the reason that you are returning the voucher. If none of the reasons apply, select "Other". The reason you select will not affect the outcome of your refund.
 Groupon will process the refund immediately, but it may take a few days for your bank to process it. The money will be refunded to the account that was used to purchase the voucher.


You'll receive a confirmation that a refund has been issued at the email address you used for your Groupon account.
 Groupon vouchers can always be redeemed for the original purchase value, even after the deal has ended. If you have old Groupons that you wanted to refund, consider using them to get the original value at the company.

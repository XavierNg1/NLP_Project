, Use the stencils to draw the designs onto the backing paper of the glow-in-the-dark tape.

, Simply pull the backing off the decoration and stick to steps, walls, the door or objects, as needed.
 They should all be exactly the same size, so use the first one as the template for the other ones. Cut enough to cover the size of the decoration when lined up side by side.
 Line them onto on a piece of paper or tabletop with a craft cutting mat underneath.
 After taping, check that they don't slide around before drawing.
 Use the whole area of the joined taped pieces.
 The tape side should still be facing downward. Either tape or pin the design to the work surface so that it won't move as you carve out the design.
 Be sure you're pressing on a cutting mat to avoid cutting the surface beneath it.


It's a good idea to number each piece to make reassembly of the large decoration easier.
 When sticking the down, be sure to match the pieces exactly next to each other to form the large decoration again. Stick to steps, the wall, a door, etc.

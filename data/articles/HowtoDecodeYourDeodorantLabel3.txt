 The non-profit Environmental Working Group has created an app that you can use to check any cosmetic product for potential risks to your health. Download the app, which is available for free. Use it by scanning a product’s bar code, see its health and safety rating, and read reviews.The app also allows you to check food products. It can greatly diminish the research you would otherwise need to do to ensure the products you’re purchasing are safe.
 One of the easiest ways to ensure you’re not exposing yourself to too many potentially dangerous ingredients is to choose an organic deodorant. You won't have to read the label too closely; they will include ingredients of all sorts, all of which will be natural.


Organic deodorants don't necessarily come in traditional deodorant applicators. For instance, they may come in roll-on applicators, jars, and even pump-top bottles of deodorizing lotion.
Good examples include Ambre Blends Natural Deodorant, Nubian Heritage All Natural Deodorant, Lavilin Deodorant, and Soapwalla Deodorant Cream.You can find them online.
 The vague benefits that cosmetic labels often imply can make often be hard to decipher. For instance, the phrase “clinically proven” indicates only that the product was tested on people experimentally. It does not mean that a rigorous clinical study was done with a large number of test subjects. In short, never assume that something a cosmetic label claims is backed up by legitimate scientific studies.


FDA regulations on the claims that cosmetics labels make are much less stringent than they are on drugs.
"Dermatologist tested” does not necessarily indicate that the product was legitimately scientifically tested.Similarly, “hypoallergenic” does not necessarily indicate that a product is any safer than another, even for those with sensitive skin. This is purely a marketing term.

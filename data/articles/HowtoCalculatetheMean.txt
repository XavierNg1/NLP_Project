 These numbers can be big or small, and there can be as many of them as you want. Just make sure you are using real numbers and not variables.


Example: 2,3,4,5,6.;
, You can use a calculator or a spreadsheet, or do it by hand if the set is simple enough.


Example: 2+3+4+5+6=20.
 If you have values that repeat in your set, each one still counts in determining your total.


Example: 2,3,4,5, and 6 make for a total of five values.
 The result is the mean, or average, of your set. This means that if each number in your set was the mean, they would add up to the same total.


Example: 20 รท 5 = 4
Therefore 4 is the mean of the numbers.

 Around eight AM should do it.This will help your muscles get used to moving after sleep. If you didn't get your eight to eleven hours of sleep last night, save the great day for tomorrow. You will need energy.;
, Stay away from sugary cereals and caffeine, (no Fruit Loops or Mountain Dew) as they will give you a boost and then make you feel groggy later. Eat oatmeal with fruit, or hearty bacon strips and pancakes.
 Read a book, play a board game, or just practice your violin until around ten o'clock AM. Do something that you enjoy, and it will get you in a good mood for the rest of the day.
 You will need it later in the day. Be sure to follow the recipe instructions or you could end up with one tough cookie, or worse. But have fun with it.
 Bring a picnic basket full of yummy food, and whatever you made earlier. Play on the swings, slide down the slides, and play some tag or hide 'n seek.
 Lay a soft blanket on the grass and just have fun. Good foods are sandwiches, apples, pears, cookies, and baked potato/corn chips. Be sure to bring juice boxes and water bottles.
 Have fun, play tag, and swing on the swings. You should have lots of energy from the healthy lunch you ate earlier. Be careful though, you don't want to get hurt on the playground. If you get tired, just sit on a park bench and watch the pretty ducks, squirrels, etc.
 Make it a party. Swim to your hearts desire, you can even race your friends. Jump into the deep end if you can swim, and have a contest to see who can make the best splash.
 If this isn't your style, make something with clay, play with building blocks, or just dance around to your favorite music. Sing like nobody is listening, dance like nobody is watching. Just have fun.
 Ask your mom if you can invite a few friends over for dinner.
 Go to bed around seven thirty, eight, or at the latest, nine o' clock. Listen to some relaxing music and move on to dreamland. Maybe next weekend you can have another great day.

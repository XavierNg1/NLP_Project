 It won't seem so long and boring if you do it with people who you care about. Call your friends and family and make it a fun get-together project. Afterwards, do something fun like a barbecue or a home movie night.
 Most everyone participates in social networking online, so make spring cleaning more fun by sharing before-after photo's to inspire and entertain your friends, family, and peers. By sharing your spring cleaning tasks online, the task of spring cleaning won't seem so tremendous anymore.
 Getting the kids to join is a breeze when you put some fun and foolishness into your work. Having them start spring cleaning at a young age, they will enjoy pitching in and will want to help more often, also giving them a sense of accomplishment, collaboration, independence, and responsibility.

 A mason jar with an accompanying lid is ideal, however you can hold ingredients in a variety of interesting, transparent or lightly colored containers.

Consider using disposable Tupperware. Disposable Tupperware is ideal if you are giving gifts to teachers or other individuals where your child will be presenting the gift (so you don’t have to worry about glass breakage).



 


Fancy jars can make a great gift. Local craft or glass warehouses have a variety of containers with cork tops or lids. If you want to get a little more creative, stop by one of these shops to explore other possibilities.

, Make sure you’ve removed any dust, debris or dirt that might have accumulated inside and outside of the jar before adding the ingredients. You might also need to remove any labels that aren't forming part of the gift.


Wait to add ingredients until the jar is completely dry. If the jar you’ve chosen has a narrow opening (and you can’t stuff a paper towel inside to dry it), allow ample time (which could be a few days) for it to air dry. If you add dry ingredients to a wet bottle it could ruin the gift.
 Presentation is everything, especially if you're giving these brownies as a gift. For an old-fashioned presentation, wrap a mason jar containing brownie mix inside a gingham patterned cloth and tie with a jute ribbon. Or, you could include the brownie mix in a larger basket of goodies/items and tie a simple white ribbon around the top.

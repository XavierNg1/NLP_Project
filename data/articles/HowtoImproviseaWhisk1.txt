 Before whisking, you want to make sure that the container is much larger than your starting product. This way, there will be enough room for the mixture to move around.You should also be sure to use a container that can withstand the fork. If you are using a non-stick pan, it could be damaged by your fork-whisk.;
, Use two forks that are approximately the same size. They should also have the same length handle.
 Place them on top of one another with a folded paper towel in between the handles. This paper towel will simple add some space between your forks, which helps add air to the mixture like a standard whisk would. Use tape to connect them halfway down the handles.
 Now that youâ€™ve created your makeshift whisk, make sure that you use it correctly. Hold the bowl at an angle with your whisk in the mixture. Make very small circles very quickly, mostly using your wrist. Dip the whisk in and out of your mixture to help incorporate air.

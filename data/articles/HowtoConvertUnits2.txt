 Figure out exactly what the problem is asking, and write it as a math problem. Here's an example:


If a bicycle is moving 10 miles per hour, how many feet does it travel in one minute?
Write this as "10 miles / hour = ? feet / minute" or "10 miles / h = ? ft / min".
 Remember, you can only convert between two units that measure the same thing. In our example, we have units that measure length (miles and feet), and units that measure time (hours and minutes). Start with one pair and find the conversion between them.


For example, 1 mile = 5,280 feet.
 Just as describe in the section above, we can write the conversion as a fraction to cancel out units. Make sure to include every unit in your calculations.


10 miles / h) x 5280 ft / mile
= 52800 miles x ft / h x miles

, One of your units should be on the top and the bottom, so you can cancel them. You aren't done yet, but you're getting closer.


52800 miles x ft / h x miles
= 52800 ft / h

, Choose a unit that hasn't been converted, and write down the conversion as a fraction. Remember to arrange the fraction so the units will cancel out during multiplication.


In our example, we still need to convert hours to minutes. 1 hour = 60 minutes.
Right now, we have 52800 ft / h. Since hours (h) is on the bottom, we want our new fraction to have hours on top: 1 hour / 60 minutes.
52800 ft / h x 1 h / 60 min
= 880 ft x h / h x min


, Another unit should cancel out, just as it did before.


880 ft x h / h x min
= 880 ft / min


, If your answer is in the units you were trying to convert to, you're done with the problem. If you're not there yet, convert another unit with the same method.


Once you're used to this method, you can write all the conversions on one line.For example, we could solve our example problem like this:
10 miles/h x 5280 ft/mile x 1 h/60 min
=10 miles/h x 5280 ft/mile x 1 h/60 min

= 10 x 5280 ft x 1/60 min

= 880 ft / min.

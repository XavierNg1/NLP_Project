 Moving quickly into a stretch is a recipe for injury. Instead, always move your body with deliberate slowness, coaxing instead of forcing your body into the stretch.


Slowly moving your body into a stretch allows you to accurately monitor how far you can go before the stretch becomes painful.If you move into a stretch too fast you won’t be able to tell precisely when the stretch became painful.;
, This advice can seem counterintuitive since most physical activities require you to push into your limits if you want to make progress. With stretching, the opposite is true. “No pain, no gain” does not apply to stretching.To find your limit, perform a stretch slowly and right up to the point where it hurts. Then, draw the stretch back until it no longer hurts. This is the sweet spot where you should hold the stretch.
Over time, you will find that your limit moves further and further into the stretch.
 The goal of stretching is to become more flexible and feel more agile and comfortable in your body. If you practice stretches that tax your body and are very difficult or painful, you will reach the opposite result.If you try a stretch and it is very difficult or painful, scrap it and substitute a different stretch.
There are many ways to stretch every muscle in your body, so don’t worry if you’re unable to perform every stretch.

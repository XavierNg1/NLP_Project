 Open one 15-ounce (425 g) can of chickpeas. Pour the can through a strainer to drain off the soaking liquid. Rinse the chickpeas with fresh water and transfer the chickpeas to a serving bowl. Chop 2 tablespoons of fresh Italian parsley and 2 tablespoons of fresh basil. Add the herbs to the bowl.Use your favorite variety of fresh basil.
 Stir in 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, 4 teaspoons of extra-virgin olive oil, and 1 small pressed garlic clove. Sprinkle in 1/3 cup (35 g) of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and add coarse kosher salt and pepper to taste., You can make the lemon, parmesan, and herb chickpea salad up to four hours ahead of time. Making the salad ahead of time will develop the flavors. Cover the salad and refrigerate it, if you'll be waiting several hours to serve the salad.Let the chickpea salad sit out for at least half an hour before you serve it. This will bring it closer to room temperature.

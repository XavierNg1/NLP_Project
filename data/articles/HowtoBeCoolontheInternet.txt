 Watch how people communicate in the forum. Learn from how they act. Also take this chance to prepare yourself for any rude people you may encounter.;
, If you cautiously start posting and hanging out, people will notice you more, and probably think you're cooler.
 Don't just reuse peoples' jokes, but be inspired by their sense of humor.
 Although it may seem cool to use words such as "thx", "btw", etc. it causes other people to think that you have no life and have to use "txt talk" to get your point across. Using the full word shows that you're smart and mature. The word 'lol' can be okay when used occasionally.
 Be offline for a certain amount of time, but at the same time, show that you are committed to the site by logging on.
 Although it may feel cool to stand up for someone, never get involved because then you can make an enemy and risk having less fans.
 If it's a website where basketball players can share drill ideas and all that other whatnot, be good at basketball so you have something to offer to the group instead of just being "there to steal ideas". If it's a writing website, improve your craft. However, if you joined the website to get good at something while not having that much skill, try to get to know everyone on there and treat people with an extensive amount of respect. Remember. Respect doesn't mean only having formal conversations. That can just be kind of awkward after a certain amount of time. Have fun too.
 But be careful. Some people who might be looking for attention will try to see if they can win your approval or favour by posting absurd posts.
, It may take some time, but it'll be worth it.

If possible, bring a reflexology chart into the room where you'll be doing ear reflexology.If you don't have an ear reflexology chart, you can print one from the internet.;
, You should do reflexology in a quiet room where you will not be disturbed. Find a comfortable chair or couch. Sit upright in a comfortable position to do ear reflexology., Start with the lobes. Gently press your lobes between your index finger and thumb. Pull them down gently as you press them. Do only a gentle tug. Stop pulling if you feel pain., You do not want to perform reflexology on any sore areas of your ears. Trace your fingers along your ears. Notice any sore or sensitive areas, or any scratches or abrasions. Leave these areas alone while doing reflexology. Reflexology should reduce, not increase, pain and discomfort.

You might only need to remove a few branches if the tree is interfering with another object. If you are unsure if the tree is dead or dying, you can call an arborist or tree doctor to diagnose the problem.;
, Check to make sure the tree isn't caught up in wires or other trees. Make sure there is room for the tree to lie flat on the ground.


This might involve estimating the height of the tree.
 Take a step back so you can see the entire tree and the surroundings.


A tree will be much easier to remove if you can fell it the way it's organically angled. It's possible to fell a tree in any direction though.



A decayed or hollow trunk is unpredictable. You might not be able to fell it to direction you intend because a decayed tree can collapse at any point.
 These routes should be clear of obstacles. Escape routes are used if the tree begins to fall out of control.



Small trees can be sawed with a handsaw. You will need a chainsaw for trees with a trunk diameter of more than 1 foot (30.48 cm).
, This is called the undercut and it should be about a quarter of the tree's diameter deep.
 This is called the backcut and it releases the stress the undercut places on the tree.
, Start from the bottom of the tree and work your way up to the top.

Drill holes into the stump with a drill. Pour wood-eating chemicals into the holes.
Let the stump decay away on its own. This takes anywhere from 5 to 10 years.
Dig the stump out yourself with a pick and a spade

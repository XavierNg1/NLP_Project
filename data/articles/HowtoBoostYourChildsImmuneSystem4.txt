 One way to stop the spread of germs is to encourage your child to wash their hands frequently. Tell your child that they should wash their hands after activities like playing on the playground, going to the bathroom, and sneezing or coughing into their hands. Also, encourage them to wash their hands before handling food or eating. Model the same behavior for your child.Show your child how to use soap to thoroughly scrub up their hands. If they aren't washing long enough, get them to sing "Happy Birthday," which is about the right length of time.
 When your child picks up germs from surfaces and other kids, they are often transferred into the body through the mouth or eyes. By teaching your kids to keep their hands away from these areas, you can help keep them from getting sick., While you want your kids to be giving and kind, you don't want them to share germs. One way you can help limit exposure is to make sure your kids aren't sharing food, cups, utensils, or water bottles that have been in their mouths. Germs can be passed easily this way.

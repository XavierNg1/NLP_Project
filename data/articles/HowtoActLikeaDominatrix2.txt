 How can you dominate someone if you can't assert yourself? Focus on the fact that you are in charge.
 There's a big role-playing component with being a dominatrix. Be creative.
 A dominatrix must be well versed in common BDSM practices.


A pro-dominatrix may choose to have little or no sexual contact with her clients. However many do offer a full range of sexual services for their clients. Regardless of this she holds her submissive clients power in her hands - with mutual consent - and if she has sexual contact with a client she remains in complete control of what is happening.
Train to use a whip or a riding crop correctly. It requires some exercise to use it the right way where it gives the desired level of pain and burning red stripes on the skin of your client - but no wounds. Don't use too much power.
 Remember; you hold all of the power; maintain good posture and carry yourself up right at all times. This lets people know subconsciously that you are in charge.
 Rather it is her self confidence, self awareness, and ability to control the conversation. The women in tight revealing clothes is more an image that can bring out the wrong behaviors in male, as it can simply reinforce that it is all about him. Instead, make it clear that it is all about you and your pleasures and amusements.


Also keep in mind that becoming a dominatrix takes other skills. Some of which are interpersonal and customer service oriented. Proper money management and perhaps marketing. Also like most self employed people you may go through phases of little to no business. In other words if money is the only reason you'd like to become a dominatrix you may want to save up an actual nest egg to venture into it.

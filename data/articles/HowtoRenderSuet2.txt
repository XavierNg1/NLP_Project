  For example, a clear Pyrex 4 cup measuring cup with handle. Put the suet in, filling to within an inch of the top of the container.  Do not put in more than the container will hold.
 Heat on high for 1 minute.  Continue to microwave at 1 minute intervals, checking each time to make sure that the suet is melting––but not boiling. The rendered hot oil will start to clarify. If you have used raw, untrimmed suet, you will see particles that will settle at the bottom of the container, and some that will float to the top.
 When the suet is fully melted, (the timing will vary depending upon the quantity of suet rendered), filter it by pouring it through a fine steel mesh, or a funnel with a coffee filter or paper towel lining it. Caution! The oil is hot and will not pour through a filter quickly, so take your time to avoid spilling.
 After filtering, pour the hot, melted, filtered suet into a container. (If using plastic, make sure it will withstand heat.) As it cools, the suet will solidify again.

Place the clean, dry pan on the stovetop over low heat and let it warm., You will bake the oil into the pan to thoroughly coat the bottom., Pour a non-salted vegetable oil into the pan. Use enough so that the oil coats the entire bottom of the pan and is about a ½ inch (1.27 cm) high., After pouring the oil into the pan, place the pan in the oven and let it heat for 2 hours. The heat of the oven will let the vegetable oil bake into and coat the bottom of the pan.Only use this method if you have a pan that is oven-safe.
The oven doesn’t have to be completely preheated before you put in the pan.
 After two hours, turn the oven off. Instead of taking out the non-stick pan, leave the pan in overnight to keep it heating and drying., After leaving the pan inside the oven overnight, take the pan out. Your non-stick pan should be revived and ready to use!

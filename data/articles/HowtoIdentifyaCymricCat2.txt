 Unlike other cats that may appear big but weigh very little, the Cymric is both big and heavy. This is because the Cymric has a very sturdy and solid bone structure.Its well-developed hindquarters enable it to jump and balance on very high ledges despite its absence of tail.
 Cymrics are medium to large-sized cats. Male Cymrics can grow to be 12 to 15 pounds (5.4 to 6.8 kg) at maturity. On the other hand, female Cymrics can grow to be 8 to 12 pounds (3.6 to 5.4 kg) at maturity., It is usually made up of only one or two vertebrae. In addition to a knob tail (also called a rumpy-riser), the Cymric may be tailless (also known as rumpy). These short tails give the Cymricâ€™s rear end a rounded appearance.Cymrics may also have a tail that is slightly longer than the knob that may be kinked, knotted, or curved (these are known as stumpies).
 Cymrics are typically multi-patterned cats. They may have a tortoiseshell, calico, bicolor, tabby, or ticking pattern. However, they can also have a solid, smoke, or shaded pattern., For a Cymric, long guard hairs stand out from a thick, downy undercoat. The long hair that stands out from its undercoat is what distinguishes it from a Manx cat.

 When someone offers you baby name advice or opinions that you don’t want, simply thank them and then progress the conversation onto a new subject.For example, if someone suggests a name, simply say to then, “I’ll keep that one in mind, thank you. So, how was your day at work?” If someone offers input on a name you've already chosen, let them know, "I'll consider your advice. Now, how was your day?"
Try to shift the conversation toward the other person to avoid any further unsolicited baby advice.
 Perhaps there is a name that is significant in your family. Or perhaps there are certain social or cultural connotations that accompany certain names in your area. Consider who is offering the advice and why, and be willing to listen, even if you already have a name you like.Know that listening does not mean you need to apply the advice. However, listening politely may make others feel like they were heard this time and keep them from pressuring you in the future.
Understand that this advice may come out of love or from genuine concern. Know that it is likely not meant to hurt, shame, or otherwise insult you.
 If someone is looking to advise you or give you an opinion, shift the subject from baby names to something you actually want advice or an opinion on. For example, you may want to ask them if they know of any good pediatricians in the area or affordable but safe car seats.


When you are talking with the person, try turning the subject by saying, “I’m still considering baby names right now, but do you know of a good daycare program for young children?”

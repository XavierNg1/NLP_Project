 Look for Google Chrome on your computer and open it. The web browser will load.
 Type in “chrome://extensions” on the address bar and press Enter on your keyboard. The Extensions page will load.
 Scroll down the page to see more.
 Go through your extensions one by one and check if it’s something you want to keep. Remove the tick on the checkbox beside the Enabled text of each extension you want to disable. The disabled extension will be grayed out.


Disabled extension are still installed on your Chrome, but it’s just not active.
 If you want to permanently remove the extensions, click the trashcan icon beside them. Once you do, the deleted extensions will be uninstalled and will no longer be available in your Chrome.


This step is optional, and you should only do so if you’re certain you won’t be needing the extensions anymore.

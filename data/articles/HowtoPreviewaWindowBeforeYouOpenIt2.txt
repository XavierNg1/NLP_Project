 Press and hold the Alt key then tap the Tab ↹ key once at the same time to show the Windows Switcher window. Continue holding the Alt key.
 Using the Tab ↹ key on your keyboard, cycle through the Windows Switcher window until the window you want to preview is selected. The rest of your desktop will fade out, exposing the contents of the window.
 Cycle back to the window you were working in before by tapping Tab ↹ then release the Alt key.

 The plant must be healthy and established before it is divided.;
, Plants cannot be actively growing when they are divided.
 Plants such as mint, chives and tarragon grow this way and are good candidates for division.



Push the shovel deep into the dirt, beneath the plant. You want the shovel to go beneath the root to bring up the entire herb plant. Gently lift the herb plant out of the ground.



Insert the knife or spade into the center of the plant, and cut down through the dirt and roots. Cut it in half so you have 2 plants.
Repeat the cut again with the 2 plants if you want to continue dividing. You can make the sections as small as you want, just make sure each new plant has roots and leaves (also called shoots).
Try pulling the plant apart if you do not want to use a knife. Some herbs, such as chives and lemongrass, will divide easily, without the use of any tools.
 You can put them in different spots, or keep them planted close together.


Dig a hole in your garden that will accommodate the roots. You do not want any roots to be sticking up out of the dirt.
Cover the roots and bottom of the plants with soil. Use a potting mix with whatever you have in your garden. Pat it into place.
 You do not want the roots to dry out. Continue to water daily until the new herb plants have become established, or begun growing new roots. You will know this has happened when you see new growth on the plant.
 If you do not want to put all of your newly divided herb plants in the garden, choose a decorative pot for them.


Put some soil on the bottom of the pot. Fill it about halfway, or enough so that the roots of the herb plant will be covered.
Place the herb plant inside the pot.
Add soil to the pot, filling it and covering the roots.
Water the potted plant and place it outdoors or inside, where it will get sunlight.

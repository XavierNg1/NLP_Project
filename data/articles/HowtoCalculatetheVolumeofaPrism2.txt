 The formula is simply V = side3. A cube is a prism that happens to have three equal sides., All of the sides are equal, so it doesn't matter which side you choose.


Ex: Length = 3 cm.
 To cube a number, just multiply it by itself twice. The cube of "a" is "a x a x a," for example. Since all of the lengths of the sides of the cube are equal, you don't have to find the area of the base and multiply it by the height and then multiply it by the length. Multiplying any two sides of the cube will give you the area of the base, and any third side could represent the height. You can still think of this as multiplying the length, width, and height when they all just happen to be the same.


Ex: 3 cm3 = 3 cm. * 3 cm. * 3 cm. = 27 cm.3


, Don't forget to put your final answer in cubic units. The final answer is 27 cm.3

 There are different sounds you can make while using a slide. You can try different sliding techniques to create different slide sounds by starting in different places, playing different notes, or changing hand speeds.


For example, if you want a bluesy sound, start below the fret and slid up to the fret.This may be uncomfortable because you are conditioned to aim just under the fret.
You can also use vibrato to get a different kind of sound from sliding. However, don’t try to move the string up and down as you would with normal vibrato because this won't work with the slide on. Instead, get the same effect by moving the slide back and forth slightly., In order for the slide technique to sound right, your slide should be directly parallel to the frets as you play. Think about the slide as a replacement for the fret on your guitar.


There are advanced sliding techniques where you can learn to angle your slide. However, when you are beginning, keep it centered directly above the fret until you are completely comfortable., There are certain notes you will play that will cause your hand positioning to change. For instance, if you are playing notes on the higher two strings, shift the slide up off the bottom strings so it only hits the top strings. If it hits the lower strings, it may cause clatters and bumps that you don’t want, even if you are muting those strings.


When you play the lower strings, the slide will be on all the strings. Just be sure to mute the higher strings very well with your index finger.

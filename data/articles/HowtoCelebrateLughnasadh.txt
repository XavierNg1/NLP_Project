 You see, certain smells will bring up happy memories of the year before just like Christmas music does and the smell of a warm loaf is sure to keep the family happy, especially if the children can help you make it. It represents the first loaf of harvest and some use it in ritual whereas some have it as part of their meal.;
, Pumpkin soup, harvest broth and casserole made with seasonal vegetables such as spring onions and potatoes will be great. Blackberry pie and cream made with fat ripe brambles will be delicious for a dessert. There are plenty of harvest recipes on the net so explore them and discuss them and plan out your menu.
 Encourage your family members to prayer or meditate to give thanks for the abundance and generosity of nature. If you sit in a circle you can share your spiritual energies with one another.


Do this in the garden or somewhere natural and quiet and hope the weather stays fair and bright. Some will use the loaf they have baked to eat after their ritual. It's because of nature that they can enjoy this food. You could always have the meal on the late afternoon and go for a picnic for lunch in the warm countryside with all the family.
 Harvest is a popular time of year for anyone whatever their religion so it's no wonder why many villages and towns have their own celebrations. Try to attend one of these even if they're a bit out of your way. It will get the family into it more to see other people having fun in ways that can only be done in community games.


Perhaps you could even get work joining in the harvest and truly get into the spirit of it all.
 If you have young children think of a story and tell it to them either the night before or on the day itself. It will be easier for them to understand the festival like this. Try singing some songs as well to the wheels on the bus (e.g. The leaves on the tree come falling down, falling down, falling down) which was invented by Tracy Roe.

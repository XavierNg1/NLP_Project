 In a large stove pot, combine equal amounts of water and white vinegar. Mix the ingredients together, then set the pot on the stove., Measure out two or three tablespoons of lime or lemon juice. Dump them into the pot of water. If you don’t have juice, you can slice up a whole lemon and add it to the pot., Turn up the heat on the stove and allow the water to boil. Once it does, turn the heat back down to a simmering level.
 Let the tarnished area of the aluminum soak in the water for 10-15 minutes. Again, if your piece does not fit in the pot, stop up the sink and dump the water in there along with the aluminum.Again, take precautions when transferring boiling water. Cover exposed skin and slowly pour the water into the skin.
 Place the aluminum under a faucet. Use warm water to rinse off any of the acid left over., Most of the corrosion comes off during boiling. For anything left over, use a soft-bristled scrub brush, non-abrasive sponge, or toothbrush to attack the tarnished areas.


Steel wool does help rid the aluminum of tarnish you can’t otherwise remove. Scrub back and forth rather than in a circular motion. Steel wool does scratch aluminum, so use it as a last resort.
 Use a soft cloth or a paper towel to remove all leftover moisture from your aluminum piece. This will ensure that it doesn’t gain water stains.

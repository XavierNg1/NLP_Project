 Dozens of instant messaging websites and traveler forums allow you to connect with people who live where you will be visiting. Don't be hesitant to ask them for suggestions and recommendations on what to visit, where to travel, and where any locally popular attractions are located. This will let you get a sense of how the people in the area really live.;
, On the plane, train, cruise, or bus ride to your destination, try starting a conversation with someone. Chances are you may find a person native to the area or who knows someone that lives there.
 Upon arriving at your destination, ask the staff or concierge at your hotel, resort, or lodge where the locals hang out. You may receive a much more personalized answer than a traditional guidebook can provide.
 While most tourists spend much of their trip exploring big cities, schedule a day or two to stop in smaller towns or suburbs outside the city where more locals are usually found. Strike up a conversation with a friendly looking stranger at a restaurant or store.
 Kindness goes a long way, especially from tourists visiting a foreign destination. Make sure to research the customs, traditions, and cultures of the people you'll be interacting with, and always greet people in a friendly manner or you risk insulting them.
 Various travel communities allow you to use services that locals provide, including accommodation, dining experiences and transport. These allow you to immerse yourself into the local culture, and see their lifestyles from a first-hand perspective.
 Be a friend to them and let them ask about you.

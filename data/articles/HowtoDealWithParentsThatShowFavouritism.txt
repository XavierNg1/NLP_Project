 Your parents may relate differently to your sibling, and and act differently around them, but not favor them. They may not realize that they make you feel as though they favor your sibling.;
, This can be a mental list or a real list, which you will use later to speak to your parents. Try to come up with specific examples to back up what you're saying.
 Ask if you can speak with them about something important, and make sure your tone is non-accusatory.
 Remember not to get angry, or use the examples as accusations. Once you get angry, they may clam up and stop listening. You want this to be a discussion where you both can share your sides of the story, not an argument about what they're doing wrong.
 Some parents don't want to listen, and will become angry if you explain that you feel they are playing favorites. If they don't listen and get angry, or if you feel yourself angry, prevent the discussion from becoming an argument.
 Jealousy can make it hard to avoid blaming your siblings, and anger can make it had for you to avoid blaming yourself. However, blame does not fix this problem, and tends to make you focus too much on anger you may feel.
 Avoid seeking their approval for everything, and have pride in yourself. This will help you see that not being the "favorite" does not mean you are not as good.
 Sometimes, the anger will get to you, and you will need to vent. Don't worry, just get your feelings out so you can allow yourself to move on from them.
 It can be tough to deal with parents that shower your sibling in gifts and money, yet give you a hard time when you ask for something. If you're old enough, look for a job to earn things for yourself. Spend more time outside of your home in a more accepting and supportive environment.

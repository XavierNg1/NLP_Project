 Borax powder contains boron, a substance that is poisonous to self-grooming insects like ants, silverfish, beetles, and cockroaches. Sprinkle borax powder in areas of your home that insects frequent (e.g. the floor of a storage cupboard), making sure that no pets or children have access to it. Alternatively, make an insect bait by mixing borax with a sweet and sticky substance like honey or corn syrup., Sprinkle borax powder on areas of your carpet that are ridden with fleas. Use a stiff broom or carpet brush to brush the powder deeper into the carpet to reach any fleas that are hiding in it. Let the powder sit for six hours, then vacuum it out.Keep small children and pets away from the area as it may cause skin irritation, or breathing problems in cats.
Note that borax can kill fleas and larvae but will not destroy the eggs.
 To keep mice from certain areas of your house, sprinkle borax powder in a thin line along the bottom of the wall. Mice tend to move along the bottom of walls and will likely avoid areas where they have come into contact with borax, which sticks to their feet. Be sure to avoid sprinkling it on areas of the floor that you may step on.

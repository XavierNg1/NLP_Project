 When a high concentration of dish soap is combined with water, it forms a catalyst bath for silicone—it allows the silicone to cure faster. In the large bowl, combine approximately 64 ounces of water with 4 ounces of blue dish soap. Mix the soap and water together with your hands., Use a pair of scissors to cut off the tip of the 100% silicone. Insert the bottle into a caulk gun. Empty enough of the 100% silicone into the catalyst bath to surround your master part.


If you are unsure how much you will need, use the entire bottle of 100% silicone., Submerge your hands into the catalyst bath and slowly gather the strings of 100% silicone into a ball. Massage the ball with your fingers. Pull, stretch, and fold the 100% silicone as you knead it. Continue to knead the 100% silicone until it stiffens and becomes less malleable., Retrieve your master part. Carefully flatten out the 100% silicone so that it is ½ inch thick. Cover the master item with the 100% silicone—press the 100% silicone into all of the knocks and crannies of the master part. Once you have formed the mold, attempt to wiggle the master item out and back into the mold. If you can easily achieve this, the mold is ready to cure. If you can not, reform or cut away parts of the mold.Applying a release agent to the master item will make it easier to remove from the mold.
 Pour soapy water onto a paper plate so that it just coats the surface—this will prevent the silicone from adhering to the plate. Set your mold and master item onto the plate and allow it to cure for 1 hour. When the mold is no longer tacky to the touch, remove the master item.


While the mold is curing, it is essential that the master item remain within the mold.

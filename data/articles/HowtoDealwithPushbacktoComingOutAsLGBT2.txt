 If you have come out at work and are experiencing negative comments or other forms of workplace hostility, keep a log of every incident. Write down what happened, when and where it happened, who said what, and who might have witnessed it. Save any evidence, such as emails, photos, or notes.Firmly and politely tell any involved party to stop their behavior. Then tell your supervisor about the behavior, and that you have taken steps to stop it.
If the behavior continues, or if you do not feel safe talking to your harasser, go to your supervisor or to Human Resources.
 If your boss does nothing to protect you, or if the harassment is coming from high up in the company, file an official report. In the United States, you can file with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Any sex discriminatory behavior is covered under Title VII.File within 180 days of the harassment.
You do not need an attorney to file the complaint.

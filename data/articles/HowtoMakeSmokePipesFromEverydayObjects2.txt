 The best cylindrical crater diameters readily available include 7/32 inch (5.5-mm), 6-mm and 1/4 inch (6.3 mm) inner-diameter of nipple.

If the nipple you have found is wider than that, insert a snug-fitting metal (usually brass) tube-segment to narrow it down.
If your nipple is narrower than the above diameters, use a variable-speed drill at slow speed to drill it open to the correct width and depth of crater as shown in the diagram above.
 Attach a flexible long draw tube that fits snugly over the barbed tail end of the hose nipple. You can stretch the outermost half inch of the hose with needle-nose pliers, making it easier to slip the hose over the end of the barbed brass stem., To the barbed shank of hose nipple, tightly wind a 5-inch wire braid and attach a safety pin.,

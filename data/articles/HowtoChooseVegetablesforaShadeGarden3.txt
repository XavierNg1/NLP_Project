 To encourage good growth, start crops indoors in planters and then move them outdoors once they have germinated. This will help the seeds germinate quickly and make growing the crops outdoors in the shade less painstaking.


You may also want to keep certain crops in planters so you can move them to sunnier areas in your garden later. Leafy herbs like basil or leafy greens like kale may do better in planters so they can be moved if need be.
 If you have an existing garden and want to plant vegetables in shadier areas, organize them by shade-tolerance. Put vegetables that need direct sunlight in the sunny spots and then plant vegetables and herbs that do well in partial to light shade in these spots in your garden. This way, your garden is organized based on what will grow best in sunlight and in the shade.Do not try to plant vegetables or herbs that require full sunlight in shady spots, as they will not grow well.
 To attract more light in shady spots in your garden, you can try painting nearby walls and fences white. This will help to reflect sunlight on the garden on hot, sunny days.Have light colored paving on driveways or sidewalks next to the garden can also help to reflect sunlight onto the gardenâ€™s shadier spots.
 If you notice certain vegetables or herbs starting to wilt in the shade or if they do not appear to be growing at all, try moving them to a sunnier spot. You can try replanting them or move them in planters to a spot with direct sunlight in your garden.Most shade tolerant vegetables and herbs will do well in the shade and do not need to be moved. But if you notice certain crops are not doing well, you can try exposing them to sunlight to get them to flourish.

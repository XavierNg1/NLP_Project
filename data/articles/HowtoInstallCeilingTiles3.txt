 A joist is a length of timber or metal that provides structural support. It's easiest to use a stud finder to locate them in the ceiling. Mark the spot with a nail or chalk mark.


You might want to start by checking for joists near lighting fixtures since they're often installed along joists.
 Measure 16 inches (40.64 cm) from the first joist and check for the presence of the next one. Joists are usually 16 inches to 24 inches (40.64 to 60.96 cm) apart, so you should find it close to those measurements. Mark a chalk line that shows the joists across the entire ceiling., Furring strips are thin 1" by 3" strips of wood that you attach at a right angle to your joists so that they are flush against the wall. You simply staple a nail into the strip. Use a level and make sure that the furring strip is level. If not, add a shim underneath to make it level.


Make sure that your furring strips are at even intervals and that they fall through the center of your tiles. You may want to hold up tiles for reference as you install the furring strips.
 Snap a chalk line down the center of the first strip closest to the wall. Align the corner tile with the line and the wall, then staple it to the furring strip, using at least 2 staples along the sides and 1 in each corner. Continue placing edge tiles., You may need to use a straight edge to cut a tile to fit around a fixture. When you reach a fixture hole, measure the size and shape of the hole and locate where it will be on the ceiling tile you're preparing to place. Use those measurements to draw and cut the hole.
 If you choose to add borders to the edges of the ceiling, use a staple or nail gun and secure the molding to the wall. Fill the holes with wood filler and paint the molding.


Molding can make your room look more polished or finished.It can also hide edges of tiles that have been cut.

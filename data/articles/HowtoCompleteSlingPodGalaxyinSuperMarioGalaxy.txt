 If you had not done it, go back to do Tarantox's tangled web. If you complete Yoshi's Unexpected Appearance, you will not find the hungry Luma!
, The hungry luma wants 400 star bits! You would have the "Sling Pod Galaxy" opened. So A very sticky situation., CAUTION: These asteroids are hazards! You will lose some health if you touch them. Shoot a star bit at one of those to defeat them., Those orange balls are fire. You will get your butt burned if you touch them! (Don't mention, there is more in Bowser's Star Reactor, Bowser's Gravity Gauntlet, AND Bowser's Galaxy Reactor) There is a ton of star bits in Sling Pod Galaxy!, If you do it incorrectly, you'll fall in the black hole and die! Be careful! And you did it! You got a Star!!!

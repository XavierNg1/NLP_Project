 Rats are intelligent animals who need a great deal of mental stimulation and activity. If you’re trying to help your rat lose weight, making sure it has plenty of activities will help it stay healthy and happy.Provide tunnels, igloos, ropes, ladders, blocks, and child or baby safe toys for your rat to play with.
Wooden gnawing blocks make great chew toys. You can also offer rawhide chew sticks or hard dog biscuits.
Old soup bones or chicken bones are fine for a rat to chew on.
 Your rat might enjoy running on an exercise wheel, which is the rodent-version of a treadmill. Make sure the wheel you find is large enough for your rat, and solid (or with very small mesh) to protect the rats’ feet and to avoid a rat tail being caught and damaged.Never get a metal wheel with rungs or a crossbar which could get your rat’s tail tangled in it.
Not all rats will enjoy running on an exercise wheel, and some may use it only for napping. However, for those rats who do enjoy it, an exercise wheel can be a great way to run off excess energy.
 The best thing you can do for your rat is to make sure it has plenty of social interaction with you and your family. Rats are very social, and will get bored and unhappy if left too often alone.Take your rat out of his cage for at least an hour every day, snuggling and petting him.
It’s a good idea to keep him within one room at a time, with the door closed, so that he can safely explore the whole room.
 Your rat will be happy to play with any number of homemade toys. Give him paper towel tubes or PVC pipes to run through. He’ll likely enjoy toys designed for birds, such as ladders, swings or anything he can gnaw on.Find a branch from a fruit tree, and place it inside his cage. This will give him something he can climb on and something he can chew on.
Keeping plenty of toys and activities around for your rat will keep him engaged and interested, and ultimately more healthy and happy.

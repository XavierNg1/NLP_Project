 No makeup looks good on clogged skin or skin that still has previous day's makeup on. Start afresh!

, Regular use of toner will help firm your skin and also reduce sight of clogs and large pores.

, Use a good concealer that is right for your skin in terms of shade and texture.

,, Don't forget to be gentle while applying and removing any products around the eyes. The skin there is very sensitive, also too much stretching will result in droopy skin around the eyes. You don't want that!

,, The eyeshadow used here are from Sephora's 'Color Daze Blockbuster' makeup kit.

,, This is the first step in defining the shape of the 'smoke' in the smokey eye look. Take your time to define this 'V' as it differs for everyone and from eye to eye. Stop and look straight in the mirror to check if you like what you see.

If you make a mistake in drawing this 'V', use a cotton bud with makeup remover on it to clean any mess :) Very sneaky ;P

By the way, if you have hooded eyes, you can make them look larger by a neat little trick - just draw an arc not on the natural socket fold but slightly above to give the illusion of a higher socket line. Also pat a little bit of the black eye shadow on the outer 'V' to add emphasis and drama.
 If you think you need more color of any of these three eye shadows, now is the time to add on. Once again use gently patting movements.

,, This step is essential as you want to create a haze, a smoke around the eyes - and smoke DOES NOT have defined lines of beginning and end :) Also, too many harsh, visible lines will look choppy and unprofessional, you don't want that.

, I always do this step to add just a little bit more intensity to the gaze of the eyes. If you want it to be subtle or if you are not really a black eyeliner girl, then you should skip this step. You can wear a smoky eye during the daytime as well if you skip this step and go easy on the mascara.

, Take one minute to fill in the brows with a brow pencil.

, No dragging single lines along the entire brow - they can give a very creepy clown-like appearance.

, Use a lip color that has a purplish hue to it, so that it looks like it belongs on the same face as the smoky eyes.

If you are confused about what lip color to wear with colored smoky eyes, then you can also opt for the safest option - a nude lip color! If nude lip is not your style, then apply a cool pinkish lip color.

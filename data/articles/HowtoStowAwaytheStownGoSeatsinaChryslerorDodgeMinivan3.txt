,,, There should be one marked with this style number. It may either start to fold the headrest down, or it may fold the remainder of the seat onto the seating portion of the seat. This cord will be hidden and over to the side. Push on the portion of the seat that will begin to fold down when you pull cord number 1.
 It will either fold the remainder of the seat onto the seating position, or it will allow you to begin to stow the seat away (depending on model year and brand).
 Release this cord slowly thereafter. Drop cord number 2 and pull on cord number 3 asynchronously, to pull the seat into it's final resting position.

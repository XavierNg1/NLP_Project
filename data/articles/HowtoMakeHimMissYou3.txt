 A guy can’t miss you if you’re always right there for him. A great way to get him to miss you is to create space between the two of you. If you spend every minute of the weekend with him, start carving out time to spend away from him. Spend a Friday night at home alone or with friends instead of hanging out with your man. At first he will probably like the time alone, but if you begin to do this regularly, he’ll start missing you in his arms.
 Start having nights out with your friends instead of date nights, and then tell your guy all about how much fun you had. He will probably be happy for you, but he’ll also be a bit jealous of how much fun you can have without him. If you spend a couple weekends having fun with friends, you’re guy will soon start to miss being the person that's having fun with you.


This works well with an ex-boyfriend as well. When an ex sees that you’re having fun and enjoying life without him, he will begin to miss being in your life.
 Start to post pictures and status updates about how much fun you’re having doing things on your own. This works very well when trying to get an ex to miss you. Show how much you’re enjoying life on your own, and your guy will be begging to hang out with you because he misses you so much.


Don’t be fake on social media, just highlight the fun you’re having going out with friends and participating in activities on your own.
 Treat yourself to a new hairstyle and new clothes so that you look and feel awesome. Dress yourself up, and then go meet your guy somewhere. He’ll be surprised at your new look, and want to see you more.If you want your ex-boyfriend to miss you, show up with your new look to somewhere you know he’ll be. Walk by him looking awesome and as confident as ever. This will make him wish he was still with you and miss the time he used to be in your life.

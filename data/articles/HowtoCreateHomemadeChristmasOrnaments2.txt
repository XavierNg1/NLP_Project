 Use craft paint to cover each nut completely with bright red paint.

When the paint is dry, using a marker or fine point brush make small black dots all over walnut.
Cut a four-point star from a 1.5-inch square of green felt.
Glue a loop of craft ribbon to the top of walnut, then secure green felt star over the top of walnut. This will make your tree look oh so festive.







Make some little dots using a black felt pen.






Then put the crumpled bond paper inside.






Tie it with a rubber band.






Get some strings or green ribbon, tie it around the top of the ornament so the rubber band will not be visible.






You will now have an alternative strawberry ornament.

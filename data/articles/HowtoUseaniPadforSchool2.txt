, Most people turn to a laptop or desktop when it comes to word processing but there are some fantastic apps available on your iPad too.

 Quite often you'll be required to present things and the iPad has some useful tools to help.

 There's no way to escape the huge amounts of tests, quizzes and exams that you have to complete in school but revising does make it so much easier.

 Using digital versions of the textbook can make your bag much lighter and mean you won't forget to bring a textbook. To do this you can use iBooks, Kindle and Kobo. If you want to ditch the paper all together you can use apps like Genius Scan to photograph a section of text and make it digital.

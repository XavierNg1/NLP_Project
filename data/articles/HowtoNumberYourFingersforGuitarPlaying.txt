 Finger numbering is not very common on guitar, but it does appear in sheet music and some chord diagrams. Your most mobile finger and the furthest to outside when playing the guitar, is your index finger. It is your first finger.









If you hold you hand up to your face, palm facing you, you simply number the fingers from left to right, ignoring your thumb.;
, Your fingers simply count up from index to pinky. This makes your second finger the middle finger.
 Your ring finger is perhaps the second most commonly used in guitar, so get used to the third finger now.
 The hardest to get used to using but crucial for complex notes, solos, and chords, the pinky is your 4th finger.
 Finger numberings are most common above a musical staff, where they tell you which finger to use. The circled number will be right above the appropriate note.

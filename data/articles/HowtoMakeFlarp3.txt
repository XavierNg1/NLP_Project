 Pour 2 tablespoons of dish soap into a bowl. Then add 1.5 tablespoons of corn starch. Mix together until the starch dissolves evenly in the dish soap.Use colored dish soap to eliminate the need for food coloring.
 Use your hands to work the flarp inside the bowl. Massage and squeeze it together. Continue to do this until the textureâ€™s consistently smooth and stretchy., Knead the mixture in the bowl so you can add more ingredients if needed to create the flarp you want to play with. Add more dish soap if you want it to be more runny and slimy. If you want it be more sturdy and dense, add more starch. Continue to knead until the ingredients are evenly mixed, and then you're ready to go!

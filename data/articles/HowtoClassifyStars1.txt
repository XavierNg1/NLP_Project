 Colour serves as a rough guide to temperature. Currently, there are ten colours, each with an associated temperature range. O class stars are blue/UV. B class are blue-white, A class white, F yellow-white, G yellow, K orange and M red. The other three classes are infrared. L class appear very deep red in visual light. Their spectra show alkali metals and metal hydrides. T class are cooler than L class. Their spectra show methane. Y class are the coolest of all, and apply only to brown dwarves. Their spectra are different to T and L class, but there is no definite definition.;
, Within each colour, there are ten temperature bands, 0-9, with 0 being hottest. Thus, A0 is hotter than A5, which is hotter than A9, which is hotter than F0 (as an example)

 Use your electric or battery operated pump to avoid getting lightheaded while blowing up all the inflatables.
 You want to construct the arch first to make sure you like the design before making it permanent.


You may need to enlist the assistance of a friend to hold the beach ball arch in place toward the top. Use small inner tubes to hold each beach ball in place.
 You may need to hold the middle portion of the arch in place until the glue adheres. Glue as you build the arch to ensure it arches and curves in the right place (as opposed to building it on the ground and then standing it up).

 Place the brown sugar in a small mixing bowl and pour the cola beverage over it. Lightly whisk the two ingredients together until evenly combined.


This glaze should be thick enough to use without thickening it over heat.
Make this glaze immediately before you intend to use it and only whisk it together well enough to combine the ingredients. The carbonation will eventually flatten after you add the glaze to the ham, but you should try to retain some of it prior to application.
 Cook the ham as usual, then pour or brush this glaze evenly over the surface of the ham during the final 30 to 45 minutes of anticipated cooking time.


This glaze can burn easily, so it's important to avoid applying it too early in the cooking process.

 You do not want excessive heat, humidity, or wind to ruin your paint job. When possible, paint your boat on a day that's roughly 60-80 degrees Fahrenheit with roughly 60% humidity.When available, paint your boat in a covered area.
 There are a lot of different paints on the market for boats -- from gel coats and simple enamels to complex two-step paint mixes. If you are painting your own boat, the best "bang for your buck" is definitely one-step polyurethane paint.


Two step polyurethane paint, while longer lasting, takes precise mixing and application techniques to use.
Most gel coats, excepting expensive, high-end options, will fade in 1-2 years.
 Make sure that your primer is compatible with your paint by reading the labels on both cans. Primer helps paint bond with your boat and prevents cracking and bubbling.


After the first coat has dried, lightly sand the boat (300-grit sandpaper) and apply another coat.
 You want to work quickly, using the roller to paint from the bottom of the boat up. Perform the bulk of the work with a paint roller and use the brush to get smaller areas afterwards.
 This may take anywhere from an hour to a day. Using 300-grit sandpaper, lightly sand the paint. This removes any spots, issues, or bubbling paint.
 Sand the boat lightly after every coat has dried. While this takes time, applying 2-3 clean layers of paint ensures your boat won't fade or crack for years to come.

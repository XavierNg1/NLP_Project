 Think about your daily routine and find a time of day that’s usually free. Morning is usually best because your mind is calmer before you dive into your day. It doesn’t have to be a long period of time—even five minutes of meditation can be beneficial, and you can meditate more than once a day if that works better for your schedule. The important thing is that you make meditation part of your daily routine., Ideally, you’ll be able to find a place you can leave set up for your meditation. The main thing to look for is a place that is quiet and relatively free of distractions.You’ll need a place where you can fit a cushion or chair to meditate on, and where you can sit comfortably.
You may want to set up your meditation space with incense, candles, or soothing images, but this is not required. Set your meditation space to be whatever makes you most comfortable.
 The general guideline is that you should meditate for however long you are comfortable, plus five minutes. It may take a few tries to figure out how long is best for you. Your meditation period will seem like forever in the beginning, but you’ll get used to it as you practice. Then you’ll be able to sit for longer, if you have the time.You can use a timer or phone alarm if you want to, but make sure that it has a soothing alarm. You don’t want to be startled out of your meditation. Make sure that you keep the device far enough away that you don’t feel compelled to check it while you’re meditating.

 Third party mirror's (such as Apple's AppleTV) are great sources of iOS mirrors for the Mac or PC to see what you are doing without actually showing the device held up to a webcam, but just purchasing an Apple TV isn't enough, and sadly, you must purchase other third-party apps (such as the Reflector app) to mirror what you are doing on your device.


Most users can choose to purchase a third party software called Reflector and mirror it that way or not use mirroring at all and choose to record it with the webcam route. Be careful. Reflector and AppleTV may be a little expensive, but that price is a one-time only price to pay for recording your device's screen for screencasting for a lifetime.

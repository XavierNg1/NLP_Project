 Emergency services may not be immediately available if a person is injured on a hiking accident. Emergency personnel may arrive more quickly in a populated area, but it is just as important to apply first aid.


If you have access to a first aid kit or gloves, make sure you put them on to protect yourself from any blood-borne diseases.
 Use your phone or digital camera to take a photo of the area before moving forward with first aid. Providing an image of the wound for emergency personnel means you may reduce the exposure of the wound to air, as they will have to open the dressings to see the wound.
 If you have sterile dressings available use them to cover the wound and apply pressure to stop the bleeding around the bone. However, if sterile dressings are not available, you may have access to feminine protection pads or urinary incontinence pads. These are cleaner than material found in the vicinity of the accident and will reduce the risk of infection. If these are not available, use white material first, such as a shirt or bedsheets. If all else fails, just use the cleanest material possible.
 Support the area to reduce pain and discomfort for the individual using soft towels, pillows, clothing or blankets.This will help to reduce the potential for shock. If there is nothing available, do not move the person or injured area and wait for emergency personnel to splint the area.
 The force of the injury and extent of the trauma may cause the individual to go into shock. This can be life-threatening. Signs of shock include: feeling faint, breathing in short rapids breaths, cold and clammy skin, blue lips, rapid but weak pulse, and anxiety.Try to place the individualâ€™s head lower than his trunk. The legs may also be elevated only if they are not injured.Make the person as comfortable as possible. Wrap her in a blanket jacket, or anything available to keep her warm.
Check the person's vital signs. Make sure her pulse and breathing continue to be normal.

 It’s best to till the soil to a depth of at least 12” (30 cm) because spinach has a very deep taproot. If you don’t have a tiller, you can use a garden spade to turn over the soil.;
, Use a shovel to work in generous amounts of rich, organic matter.


Add alfalfa meal to the soil. This will increase the nitrogen level in the soil, which will encourage fast growth. (Blood meal also adds nitrogen, and some organic farmers use it, but it can attract unwanted meat-eating animals, such as raccoons.)

, Spinach thrives in soil that has a pH level between 6.5 and 7.5. You can take a soil sample to your local nursery or agricultural extension service.

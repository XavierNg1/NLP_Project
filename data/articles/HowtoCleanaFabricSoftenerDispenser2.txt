 In a large bowl or a bucket, create a solution of 1 gallon (3.78 liters) warm water, ¼ cup (2 ounces) of liquid dish detergent, and 1 cup (8 ounces) of bleach.Since bleach is an abrasive and potentially harmful substance, wear rubber gloves while making and using the cleaning solution. You may also want to wear old clothes, in case any bleach splashes on them.


If you don’t already have any of the cleaning supplies around the house, you can easily purchase all of them at your local grocery store.
 Place the dispenser into the liquid gently, still wearing your rubber gloves, so that you don’t splash any of the bleach solution out onto yourself. You can let the dispenser soak for about 5–10 minutes so that the bleach and detergent mixture cleans the residue from the plastic., You can lightly shake the bucket or bowl holding the cleaning mixture so that it flows over the fabric softener dispenser and dislodges some of the gunk and grime stuck on the dispenser. When you do this, be careful not to splash any of the bleach solution out on your clothing or skin.


You can agitate the bucket once or twice during the 5–10 minutes you’re soaking the dispenser. More than this is unnecessary.
 Once you’ve waited 10 minutes and pulled the dispenser out of the cleaning mixture (still wearing your rubber gloves), use a clean rag or cotton cloth to wipe the dispenser clean.Remove all residue of soap and fabric softener, and fully dry the dispenser with the cloth.


If there are certain areas of the dispenser that you cannot fully wipe clean with the rag, find an old toothbrush. The toothbrush will allow you to scrub corners or other areas of the dispenser that are hard to reach., Now that you’ve removed and cleaned the dispenser, you can set it back in place in your washing machine. If the housing that the dispenser is set in also has a grimy buildup, you can clean this off by dipping your cloth in the soapy cleaning mixture and wiping the area down.

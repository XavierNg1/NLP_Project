 Heat provides a quick, easy way to reduce the discomfort of morning stiffness. To relax your muscles and increase circulation to stiff joints, use hot packs, heating pads, or a hot shower to target affected areas.When using a hot pack or heating pad, wrap the device in a thin, dry towel. Do not exceed 20 minutes of application.
Take as hot of a shower as is comfortable for you. Hot tub or whirlpool use can be especially therapeutic to relieve stiffness first thing in the morning.
Allow your skin to return to room temp before applying any topical medication.;
, Believe it or not, you can also relieve morning stiffness by applying cool temperatures to your joints. This helps reduce swelling and can numb locations of particularly bothersome pain. Ice packs, cold packs, or even a bag of frozen veggies will do the trick.Try warm and cold packs on separate days to see what works better for you. Stick with whichever seems to work better.
If either warm or cold packs are too uncomfortable, discontinue use. Your comfort is an important factor in keeping your pain low.
Wrap anything frozen in a dry towel to protect your skin, and do not apply cold to one location for more than 20 minutes. Allow your skin to warm back up to normal before applying topical medication.
 If your hands are the primary site of your morning stiffness, try soaking your hands in warm or hot water. To take your mind off of the discomfort as well, try doing a few dishes in a sink filled with hot water.Always test a sinkâ€™s water temp by quickly dipping a finger in momentarily before submerging your hands.

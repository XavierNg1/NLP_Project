 This step should be performed on the Mac computer that houses all the files you want to share with other users.


Click on the Apple menu from your Mac desktop and select "System Preferences."
Select "Sharing" to display the Sharing window, then click on the "Services" tab.

, This will give users access to the files stored on the FTP server if a firewall is currently in place.


Click on the "Firewall" tab and verify that the window displays "Firewall On." If the firewall is not turned on, click on the "Start" button.
Select "FTP Access" from the list of options provided next to "Allow." This option will allow users to access the files saved on the FTP server.
Close your system preferences window. Computers from remote locations can now access your FTP server, as long as they have the proper IP address and configurations.

 A puncture or cut in the eye can be very serious. Do everything you can to get the person to a hospital or eye specialist immediately. Do not attempt to treat a cut or puncture on your own.Call 911 if necessary.
Even if the cut or puncture seems minor, seek help. It may be worse than it looks or feels.
 Pressure in this instance can make the injury worse. Try to cover the eye without putting any pressure on it or potentially pushing the object farther into it., It may be tempting and seem natural to try to remove the object from the eye, especially if the person is in a lot of pain; however, this can potentially do a lot of damage.Wait to remove the object until a medical professional can do so. They will be able to protect the eye from further damage or infection.
 The pain from an eye injury may lead the person to want to take over-the-counter pain killers; however, a lot of pain killers such as ibuprofen are anti-inflammatory, which thins blood and can increase bleeding. These can be dangerous when an eye has been punctured and should be avoided.If the person is in serious need of pain medication, ask a medical professional which medications would be safe to take.
 An eye that has been cut or punctured is particularly vulnerable to infection or to further damage. Keep the eye covered until the person is able to be seen by a doctor.Use something such as a light cloth, or even the person’s hand to keep the eye protected. Just make sure it’s clean and isn’t putting pressure on the eye.

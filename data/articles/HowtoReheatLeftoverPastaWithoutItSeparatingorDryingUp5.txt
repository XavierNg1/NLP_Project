 This is by far the best method for cream-based sauces, such as Alfredo. The indirect heat ensures a more even, slower cooking method, reducing the chance of separation.


You can make your own double boiler out of two pans, or one pan and a glass, heat-safe bowl.
If a double boiler is not an option, use the stovetop method instead, over very low heat.
 If possible, heat the sauce separately, then pour over cold pasta or heat as described above. If the sauce and pasta are well mixed, just add them both to the container. Leave it here until the water begins to simmer.Reheating the pasta and sauce together shouldn't cause any major problems, but the risk of chewy or mushy noodles is a little higher.
 A cream sauce separates so easily because it is an "emulsion," or suspension of fat and water. A fresh splash of cream or whole milk helps keep these together, reducing the chance that the sauce becomes an oily mess., Wine sauces are also emulsions, but the acidity can cause cream to curdle. To avoid these, mix in a little melted butter instead. Another option is reduced cream, meaning cream heated in a separate pan until some of the liquid has evaporated., The lower the heat, the less likely your sauce is to separate. Stir gently, to avoid breaking apart the ingredients. Eat while the sauce is hot.
 If the sauce "breaks" apart while reheating, take it off the heat and transfer a couple spoonfuls to a bowl. Rapidly whisk an egg yolk into the bowl until smooth, then transfer the mixture back to the sauce.If you're heating the pasta as well as the sauce, the egg yolk method gets messy. Try a small handful of flour instead, to thicken the sauce and cut the greasiness.
If you end up with lumps of cooked egg while whisking, discard that bowlful and try again with less liquid and faster whisking. If the lumps are small, just strain out the lumps and use the remaining liquid.

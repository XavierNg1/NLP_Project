 Before you jump, warm up by doing some stretches. Then start to bounce on the trampoline as you do when you attempt front flips.Gain as much air as you can as you bounce on top of the trampoline.
Repeat your jumps at least a handful of times to ensure youâ€™re getting the most air possible for your flip.;
, With a front flip, the emphasis is placed on practicing motioning into a handstand. With a knee flip, the emphasis is placed on motioning into a position on your knees. Practice bouncing a handful of times and then dropping to your knees to land., Use force to lean and push your body forward. Start to flip in between your peak and right after you start bouncing.It is okay if you land on your bottom when you first start attempting this flip. You have to speed up how quickly you spin in order to land on your feet.
Don't wait until you are at your peak of your bounce to start flipping. Start flipping as soon as your knees hit the trampoline.

 Heavier oils, such as olive oil, work best for low-friction massages such as Swedish or relaxation. These oils are slipperier and don't absorb as quickly into the skin. Lighter oils, such as grapeseed, and creams work best for high-friction massages, such as sports and deep tissue. These oils absorb more quickly to prevent you from slipping as you apply more pressure but provide enough glide to prevent irritating the skin.;
, Heavier oils that don't absorb as easily may get on your clothing when you get dressed. These oils are best in situations where you have access to a shower so that you have the option to wash off any access oil. These oils also work well for an end-of-day massage in your home, where you don't have to worry about getting oil on your clothes.
 Some people like the aromatherapy benefits of scented massage oils while others may not appreciate walking around smelling like a lavender plant. Other individuals may be sensitive to strong scents, or allergic to fragrances. If you are choosing an oil for professional use, it's better to go unscented and add essential oils on a case-by-case basis. If you are choosing an oil for personal use, find a scent that you and/or partner enjoy.
 In addition to fragrance allergies, some individuals may also be allergic to nuts or certain flower extracts. For example, a person who is allergic to tree nuts should not use almond oil and individuals with ragweed allergies should avoid oils with chamomile. If you are concerned with allergies, look for oils labeled hypoallergenic.
 Some massage oils are medicated with arnica, menthol and other extracts to help reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Others may contain emu oil to relieve skin irritations. If you are using massage on a sports injury, a medicated oil would be more effective than a plain oil. However, if the person you are working on has allergies or skin sensitivities, you may wish to use a non-medicated oil and rely on technique alone.

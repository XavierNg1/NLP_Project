 Using a stovetop kettle, electric teapot, or microwave, heat up around two cups of water. The water does not need to be boiling hot; however, the hotter the water is, the better your concentrated “decoder ink” will work.
 Place 10-15 cabbage leaves in a large bowl and pour the hot water over them. Let the leaves soak for a full hour as the water cools. You should see the pigment of the cabbage bleeding into the water over time.


For the best results, all of the leaves should be submerged in the water.
 After the water has cooled, use kitchen tongs or a colander to separate the leaves from the juice.


Store your red cabbage “decoding ink” in the freezer. If you let cabbage juice sit in the fridge, it will rot and smell awful., Dip a sponge or paintbrush into the bowl of red cabbage juice and wash the liquid evenly over the paper that contains your message.
 As you coat the paper, your letters will appear in a greenish-blue color on the page. The letters appear this color because red cabbage juice works as a pH indicator and detects the basic baking soda.If the message had been written with lemon juice, which is an acid, the letters would have appeared pink instead of greenish-blue.

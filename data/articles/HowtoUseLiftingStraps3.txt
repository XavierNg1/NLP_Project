 Rolling the bar will tighten the strap. Do this until the straps pull on your wrists. Do not start lifting before the straps are tight--you will not get the full benefit of using lifting straps and may increase the risk of injury.
 Take care not to force your wrists to hold the entire weight as you lift. The lifting straps should let your wrists assist you in maintaining your grip on the bar, not do all the work.









You can injure your wrists by relying too heavily on them to lift the weight, so use your grip as well., Use a hand grips, squeeze the barbell during reps, do fist or fingertip push-ups, climb ropes, or hang from the pull-up bar to strengthen your grip so you don't have to rely too much on your lifting straps.








Lifting straps often cause weight trainers to ignore the need to strengthen their grips. This can be a real problem, especially if you compete in a sport that doesn't allow you to use straps.

 Increased physical activity helps keep food moving through the digestive system. This can increase the speed with which food is digested, and assist in the overall digestive process.


Exercise can prevent constipation and increase the speed of digestion by decreasing the amount of time food stays in the large intestine, thereby limiting the amount of water absorbed from the stool back into the body.Movement also helps stimulate the natural contractions of the smooth muscle in the digestive tract, expediting the breakdown of food.However, it is best to wait an hour or so before exercising, in order to allow the body's natural blood supply to concentrate in the digestive system, rather than fueling the heart and other active muscles.;
, Sleep gives the digestive organs the time needed to rest and repair, increasing their ability to digest food quickly and efficiently.Making some changes to your sleep will have digestion benefits that are far-reaching.


Don't fall asleep immediately after eating, wait two to three hours to ensure your body has had adequate time to digest.

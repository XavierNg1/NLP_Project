 Perhaps the best step you can take to help get in the habit of eating breakfast is making it the night before. One easy, healthy option is making oatmeal in the evening. In the morning, you can eat it cold or reheat it. Mix in nuts, fruit, or a handful of raisins and a bit of cinnamon.Oats are a great breakfast food, as they are high in fiber and will keep you feeling full well into your day.
Whole grain muffins are another good quick grab-and-go option. Make a big batch to last you through the week - and even longer if you freeze some.
You can even do the prep work for a quick omelet ahead of time by whisking the eggs and chopping the veggies ahead of time and storing them in the fridge overnight.;
, Whether you prefer to change up your breakfast day to to day or eat the same thing everyday, planning ahead will help you establish a routine. If you like to vary your meals, make a weekly plan so you can get everything you need and have it at the house. If you know you like to eat the same thing every day, stock up on what you need.For instance, have a backup tub of Greek yogurt and an extra bag of granola on hand in case your current supply runs out.
 For those days when you do wind up running a bit behind, store food at work so you donâ€™t have to go without breakfast. Definitely store a few items with stable shelf life in your desk or locker. Good options include a jar of peanut butter, protein bars, and dried fruit.If you have access to a refrigerator, consider storing protein shakes and cheese sticks in it.

 Place the skillet on a burner and turn the heat to medium high. Let the butter melt completely and make sure the pan gets very hot.


Don't use a nonstick skillet to make an omelette using this technique. The high heat can cause the nonstick coating to flake off.






This method works best with just 2 eggs, but you could add a third if you're quite hungry.
 While the butter is melting, put 2 or 3 eggs in a bowl and beat them with a whisk until the yolks and whites are combined. Using more eggs will create an omelette too thick to make with this technique; the egg mixture should spread thinly across the pan you are using. Season the eggs with a little salt and pepper, and sprinkle in chopped chives, oregano, dill, and other herbs to taste. 1/2 teaspoon of each seasons the eggs quite well.
 Be sure the pan is very hot first; the butter should be sizzling. As soon as the eggs hit the pan they will begin to bubble and cook. Stay close by, since the eggs cook very quickly when you use this technique. Cook the first side for 30 seconds.
 Pick up the pan and quickly move your wrist in a circular motion to flip the omelette to the other side. Be careful not to let the omelette flip out of the pan; use a controlled motion so that it stays centered.









This technique can take some practice. The pan should have enough butter so that the omelette easily slides across its surface and flips.
Use a spatula to turn the omelette over if you'd prefer not to chance flipping it.
 After the second side has cooked for about 20 seconds, slide the omelette onto a plate and use the lip of the pan to fold it over. This quick technique turns out simple, flavorful, perfectly cooked omelettes.

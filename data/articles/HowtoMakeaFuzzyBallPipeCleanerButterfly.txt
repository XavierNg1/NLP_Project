 Lay down two full length fuzzy wires side by side, both in the same color. Twist the two fuzzy wires together from one end. Leave about one inch (2.5cm) at the top for the antenna (untwisted).;
, This will form the antenna. The body piece is now ready for adding the wings to.
 Use one fuzzy wire for the first wing. Here you might wish to change to a different color from the body piece. Shape the fuzzy wire into a half circle shape. Attach it to the body piece by winding the ends around the body piece. Attach about one inch (2.5cm) from the top of the body piece and the other end in the middle of the body piece. This forms the top of the first wing.


To attach, wind the ends around firmly about twice or three times. Use as little wire as possible for winding on, to allow most of the wire to serve as the wing.
 Wrap just underneath each of the attachment areas of the already added wing, using another piece of fuzzy wire in the same color. After adding this, you should have two top wing pieces firmly in place. When done, the whole piece should look like an oval.
 Take another piece of fuzzy wire, either in the same color as the top wings or in a different but matching color. Make a half circle. This time, tie one end in the middle and the other end to near the base of the body piece.
 Attach just under the attachment parts for the first bottom wing. When done, the whole thing should look like a figure eight.
, Glue two balls together. Ideally, these would be in the same color, to give a uniform impression of the head shape.
 Or, add it just under the antenna. Add googly eyes if you'd like, or just leave it as it is.
 Now it's time to enjoy your new butterfly creation.

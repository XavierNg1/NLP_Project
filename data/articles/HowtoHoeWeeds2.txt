 You should be able to stand upright while you hoe weeds. Make sure the handle of your hoe is long enough to allow you to stand while using it. If the hoe forces you to hunch over while hoeing, try to find a hoe with a longer handle.
 If you want to control young weeds that are popping up in a large area or amongst your rows of plants, try a lightweight scuffle hoe. A diamond, triangle, or stirrup hoe will work best on young weeds., If you are dealing with large weeds, you can use a variety of hoes to get the job done. Try a field or grub hoe. You can also use a Warren hoe or a standard American garden hoe. These hoes can also be used to make furrows and chop compost., If you need to perform spot weeding, or if you need to remove weeds from a tight space, a hoe with a short handle will work well. You can also try using a circular hoe, collinear hoe, or any other hoe that is mounted on a short handle.

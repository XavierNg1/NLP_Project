 The bigger the marshmallow, the more delicious your treat. You can start with an ordinary-sized marshmallow, a smaller marshmallow, or even a jumbo-sized marshmallow. As long as it can be firmly placed on the wooden skewer, the process will work.


Place a marshmallow onto a wooden skewer. You should poke the skewer about halfway up the center of the bottom of the marshmallow.
If you have a large marshmallow, a popsicle stick can work instead of a skewer.;
, Just fill a pan with chocolate or caramel and melt it in the oven or microwave until you've created a warm, gooey liquid that is perfect for dipping. This will be the sweet coating you place over the marshmallow pop. When you're done melting the substance, pour it into a bowl.
 Carefully lower the marshmallow into the liquid and turn the skewer until all sides of the marshmallow are completely covered with the chocolate. You may end up with a little extra chocolate on the top of the skewer under the marshmallow.


If you'd like to add additional toppings to your marshmallow pop, like sprinkles or tiny chocolate chips, you should sprinkle them over the marshmallow as soon as your remove it from the liquid, so that they stick to the pop.
 If you want the coating around the marshmallow to be hard, then stick them in the freezer. It could take a few hours for them to harden -- just keep checking until they are as hard as you would like them to be. And if you don't want to freeze them, set them aside for at least ten minutes so they cool off a bit before you enjoy them.


If you're just waiting for your marshmallow pops to cool off, you can place them in a tall glass like flowers in a bouquet so you don't smear them by laying them down flat.
 Once your marshmallow pop has hardened in the freezer or just cooled off, hold onto your skewer and bite into your marshmallow pop. Enjoy the rich and gooey taste and take pride in a job well done.

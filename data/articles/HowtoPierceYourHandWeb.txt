 A professional, hollow (sterilized - preferably autoclaved) needle, the sterilized "barbell" jewelry to insert (make sure the needle is one size bigger than the jewelry you wish to put in), gloves, ice, and whatever else you may need.


Caution: The best way to do this is to have it done professionally, it is worth the money.

Do not have a friend do this. Great care is needed. It is neither easy nor safe.
Transmission of hepatitis, HIV, MRSA, and nerve damage are possible!
It is best to sterilize piercing equipment only with an autoclave.
Boiling for long enough is up to you. Never just dip equipment in alcohol which is not good enough, at all.
It should be considered dangerous and unreasonable to do this to/for anyone else. You might receive or give any kind of infection, blood poisoning/infection, and septic shock, etc.

;
, Now don't touch anything except your gloves and then open and use the sterile needle and the sterile barbell, when the appropriate time comes.
).
 You may have some trouble getting it to go through, but if you just keep pushing the needle through, it will eventually "come" out the other side. It is painful.
, The piercing needle will have a hollow part at the end that the jewelry will fit into and help the barbell slide through.
, Keep it clean. It will be tender, and could become infected.

See a doctor immediately, if it seems infected. You can get an aftercare sheet from www.tribalectic.com

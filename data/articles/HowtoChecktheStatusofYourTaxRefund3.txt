 Not every state collects a state income tax. If you live in any of the following states, your state does not collect income taxes and therefore does not provide tax refunds:


Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming do not have an income tax. You do not need to file a tax return in these states and you will not receive a refund.New Hampshire and Tennessee do collect an income tax, but only tax dividends and not wages or earnings. If your dividends do not exceed a certain amount, you will not be taxed. Visit your New Hampshire or Tennessee's tax division website for further information on whether or not you will be taxed., Each state has different means of providing information on tax refunds. In order to find out how to locate information in your state, you'll need to visit your state's tax division website. This can usually be found through an internet search engine. The site should provide a number you can call to talk to a representative if you have any questions.
 The information you need varies by state by state. You should have a copy of your state tax return on hand, in case you need to enter the exact dollar refund amount. Be prepared to enter your social security number or individual filing status, as well as your filing status.

 Harry Potter will not have knowledge of spells nor magic until his first year.;
, In the back right corner, have Harry stand on the beige floor tiles. Use the Wingardium Leviosa spell on the tiles, which will lift Harry up. Change the controls to Harry and go up the staircase. Have Harry grab the handle, drop down, and use it on the door.
 Use Wingardium Leviosa on the door and go through.
 This will complete the wall and allow you to enter Diagon Alley. Diagon Alley is where you can claim game extras, such as gold bricks, spells, and other useful items.
 Use your "special" button to grab the following items and place them in the cauldron:


Ice cream bar: Near the food booth
Spider Potion: Examine the spiderweb on the left
Flowers: Table on the right

, The cauldron will explode and lead you to another doorway. Have Hagrid stand in the circle and pull the chain. This will lead you to the Gringott's Bank.
 Stand in the circle and motion a wave to him. Have Griphook open the locked doorway in the middle section of the bankers.
 Open the vault using Griphook. Switch back to Hagrid so you can use Wingardium Leviosa on the fallen bricks.
 Position yourself so you can wave to him. He will open a new passage to the vault.
 Using Hagrid, pull the chain by going around and behind the dragon. Switch to Griphook to open the vault. Enter the vault to come to a cut-scene.
 Notice that you'll be back in Diagon Alley. Walk a bit to Ollivander's shop on the right (there will be a huge blue arrow pointing to the door). Walk in to complete the chapter.

 Get hold of a pad and pen or your favorite laptop and make yourself somewhere comfortable. Remove all distractions. Then sit down and begin to write. Don't worry about how it reads or what you're writing to begin with––just get started. If you feel blocked, here are some ways to help you begin:


Write about how bored you're feeling and why. Explore the feelings.
Explore any interactions you've had with relatives and friends during the holidays. Does anything good or bad stand out? Write about it.
Start with poetry. It's often a great way to get some ideas out in a flowing way, allowing you to expand in prose later.

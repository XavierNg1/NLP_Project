 All seven dwarves' heads are very round, like basketballs--look at the illustration to get it exactly right.;
, Connect it underneath the head as shown. This part will be the body.
 These will be Sneezy's arms and hands.

Draw Sneezy's left hand under his nose, as if he's stifling a big ACHOO!.
 Draw a tunic over a chubby belly, secured with a buckled belt, as well as lumpy shoes on his feet.
 Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional. Erase any leftover pencil and add color!

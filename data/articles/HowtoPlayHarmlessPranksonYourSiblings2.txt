 You will need superglue and a stick of deodorant. First, remove the lid of the deodorant. Squeeze a large amount of superglue all around the edge of the lid. Replace the lid quickly. After a few seconds, the super glue will dry and the lid will be impossible to remove.If you get any super glue on your fingers, use nail polish remover to get it off.
 Find a dry bar of soap and a bottle of clear nail polish remover. Paint the bar of soap with a few thick coats of clear nail polish. Allow the soap to dry for five to ten minutes between each coat. After three or four coats, the soap will be completely sealed in the nail polish. When someone tries to use it in the shower it won’t create any lather at all.


This technique works best with a brand new bar of soap. Older bars of soap can be soft and difficult to paint.
 Find some baby oil and your sibling’s favorite shampoo. Add a few tablespoons of baby oil to the shampoo and shake it to mix it up.When your sibling uses their shampoo, their hair will look even oiler than it did before they showered.


It’s best to do this when the shampoo is almost gone. Otherwise, your parents may get mad at you for wasting a whole bottle of shampoo.
The baby oil won’t damage your sibling’s hair.
 Find or purchase two or three alarm clocks. Set them all for different times before your sibling is supposed to wake up. Next, hide the alarms around their room. When the clocks start ringing they’ll have to get up and search for them before going back to sleep.For example, if your sibling wakes up at seven am, set the alarms for five, five thirty, and six am.
Don’t do this right before a big day at school. Otherwise, you may exhaust them on an important day.

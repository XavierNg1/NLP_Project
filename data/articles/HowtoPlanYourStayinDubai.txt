 Obviously vacations are taken only when people are ready to take them. However, there is also a right time to take a vacation. Dubai while being a year round travel destination is most suitable to be visited at the beginning of the year and towards the end of the year when the weather is cooler.


This is also the time that the city looks its best and there are plenty of activities for the whole family. During the rest of the year it is too hot and humid to get about comfortably specially with children in tow and sometimes dust storms make life somewhat difficult. However something to consider would be that accommodation is at its cheapest during the hot months. Getting about by air conditioned taxis and frequenting only air conditioned spaces many offset the uncomfortable weather conditions.;

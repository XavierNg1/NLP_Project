 Normal physical exercise is often a good way in reducing cholesterol naturally and it also raises your good cholesterol. A simple 30 minutes walk every day for 5 days a week will definitely help you a great deal. If you don't have time to attend the gym use the stairs instead of the elevator.
 Some say that alcohol might help in lowering cholesterol but only if you drink it in moderation. If you're not a serious drinker you should not begin drinking simply to reduced your cholesterol level, rather follow a good diet plan.
 If you are worried that your cholesterol is very high, talk to your doctor. It will not make you feel sick but if you eat a diet rich in fatty red meat, cheese, chips, cookies, and other unhealthy foods, this would be an indicator. Your doctor will probably do tests and make recommendations based upon the results.

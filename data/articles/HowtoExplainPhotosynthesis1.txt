 Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert the sunâ€™s energy into chemical energy. The series of reactions used to do this conversion (referred to collectively as photosynthesis) creates molecular oxygen, O2. This oxygen, which is critical for all other life on the planet, is released into the atmosphere.If you are teaching children, you can summarize this by saying that plants take in the carbon dioxide that we breath out, and turn it into oxygen.;
, Carbohydrates are molecules that are built primarily of carbon and hydrogen. They are used by plants to store the energy collected from the sun. During photosynthesis, the plant takes carbon dioxide, CO2, and water, H2O, to create a carbohydrates to store energy.Not only are carbohydrates used by the plant to store energy, but that energy is transferred to animals that consume the plant as food.
For children, you can explain that plants make sugars and starches out of sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.
 While photosynthesis is carried out by some some other organisms, the process is primarily utilized by plants. Even carnivorous plants (e.g. the venus flytrap) obtain their energy from photosynthesis and use their prey as a way to collect the materials to build cells (e.g. proteins, nitrogen, etc.). It is important that the person trying to understand photosynthesis keep the process in perspective as the way that plants, and some organisms such as certain bacteria, produce energy.Young children typically associate photosynthesis only with plants. Only mention other lifeforms if the child is old enough to know what they are.

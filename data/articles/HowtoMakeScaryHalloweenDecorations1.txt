 If you have exceptional photoshop skills, you can use a front and side view of your face to create a 3D image. Or you can download a readymade one here: http://www.instructables.com/files/orig/F53/QS3Z/HSVGCE57/F53QS3ZHSVGCE57.pdf. The illusion may work best if you print onto legal size paper.Make sure you print in color for the best looking picture. It’s going to use a lot of ink, so make sure all of your ink cartridges are full enough.;
, You will be submerging the image in a jar of water, so laminating it is important or the paper will just dissolve. Once the image is laminated, you can carefully trim any excess lamination from the outside of the image. Don’t cut too close to the paper.


If you have access to a lamination machine, this is a good option, but if not you can get large laminating sheets at craft stores or stores that sell craft supplies.
 A gallon size jar is the best option since it will appear to be the right size for a head. Fill the jar mostly full with water. For added effect, put a few drops of yellow and green food coloring in the jar. It will give the water a rotting look.


Make sure to use a jar with a lid so that you don’t make a mess.
A glass jar with a hinged lid will give the illusion a look of being really old.
 Take the laminated picture and curl it up. Slide it into the jar so that it wraps around the inside, pressing against the jar. It doesn’t need to be pressed tightly, so it if floats more in the middle, that’s okay too.You may find that you need to adjust the size of the jar for the size of the picture that you printed out. You want the picture to fill most of the jar for the illusion to be convincing.
 One great thing about this decoration is that you can set it up in a lot of different places. You could put it in the fridge if people will be getting food or drinks from there. You can set it out on the counter or on an end table in your living room.

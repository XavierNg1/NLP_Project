 Once your friend confirms, both of you need to launch Hold & Talk on Viber. Tap the microphone icon on the right of the Compose field. This will bring up a bottom section with a huge circle with a microphone and a “Hold & Talk” text inside. This is the “Hold & Talk” button.
 To start recording your message with Hold & Talk, tap and hold the “Hold & Talk” button. You will hear a beep and the circle will be highlighted in purple. A progress bar will start encircling the circle. This represents how much time you still have left before sending the voice message.


You can record up to a maximum of 30 seconds per message.
 Lift your finger from the “Hold & Talk” button to immediately send your voice message.


If you’ve consumed the maximum 30 seconds, your message will also be automatically cut and sent.
 If both you and your friend are having a Hold & Talk session, meaning both of you have Hold & Talk open, you will hear each other’s voice messages right away. You can talk normally as if you’re both on walkie-talkies.


Repeat Steps 2 and 3 from Part 2 to continue having your voice conversation.
 If one of you isn’t on Hold & Talk, the receiving party will get the voice message as an audio playback in the conversation. Listen to it by tapping the audio file.
 If you want to continue your conversation via a live call, tap the phone icon on the upper-right corner of the screen to call the other party.

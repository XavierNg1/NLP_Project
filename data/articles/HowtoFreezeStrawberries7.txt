 If you choose this method, make sure to select strawberries that fit the tray squares easily. Ideal for adding to drinks on hot days.



An alternative method for the ice cubes is to use commercial lemonade in place of water and give as sweet treats to children at a party. Do not use this method as a regular treat, however, as the lemonade is not healthy for growing teeth. If you want a healthier ice cream version, use pur√©ed strawberries and bananas and freeze in an ice lolly/icy pole mold.

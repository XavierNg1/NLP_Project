 Ebola is normally found among bats and wild monkeys, making these animals a reservoir for the virus. Direct contact with these animals, or their secretions, can result in contracting the disease., Once a human gets infected with the disease, human-to-human transmission is possible through direct contact, including touching, sexual transmission, and by being exposed to infected bodily fluids. This means that in order for the virus to be transmitted from one human to another, physical contact must be made, whether it includes bodily fluids, or just skin contact.


The virus can stay alive in sperm tissue for roughly 60 days, making male individuals highly infectious for a prolonged period of time., Some other viruses, like influenza, can be transmitted through air, making them highly infectious, but Ebola is not transmitted this way.

 You can board an airplane the same way you get inside a car; just stand beside the aircraft and press the Triangle button on your PlayStation controller to board it.;
, Press your finger and hold the R2 button on the topside of your PlayStation controller and the airplane will start to move towards the direction it’s facing. Once it gains enough speed, the plane will start to lift off the ground. Hold down the R2 button until you get to your desired altitude.
 Use the left analog stick to control the movement of the plane. You can move up, down, left, or right by simply using the left analog stick on your PlayStation controller.
 To quickly change the direction the plane is flying, press the L1 button to make a quick yaw to the left or the R1 button to yaw the plane to the right.
 Military-type airplanes, like the Hydra, have built-in guns and missiles that you can use to shoot at enemies. Press the X button on your PlayStation controller to fire these weapons and take down your target.
 Just like driving cars, you can change the view of the camera while flying planes just by pressing the right analog stick.
 If you can’t find a landing strip, you can try to land on open fields or long straight roads without any cars to crash into. Once you’ve sighted the place you’re going to land, press the L2 button to slow down the aircraft. Steer the plane as you descend with the left analog stick and press it to draw out the plane’s undercarriage to land properly.

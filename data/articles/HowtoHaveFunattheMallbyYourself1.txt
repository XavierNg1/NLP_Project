 Window-shopping is a great way to spend time without spending money. When you window shop, you can glean inspiration for how to use existing items, make a mental note of items you might want to purchase later, or satisfy your curiosity about a new season’s items and trends.You don’t have to go to the mall with the intention of window shopping, but it can turn into that when you don’t have friends pressuring or urging you to purchase something.;
, One of the greatest benefits of shopping solo is the ability to take as long as you want. When you shop with others, you have to work on a shared timetable, but when you are on your own, you can linger in your favorite part of a store, try clothes on multiple times to get a clear idea of what you like, or even just wander around.You can also go as fast as you’d like. If you walk into a store and don’t like what you see, walk right back out! You do not have to wait around for someone else to finish browsing.
 Being alone is a great excuse to visit a store you’ve never been to--particularly if there is a store you are too shy or embarrassed to visit with other people. You can visit a weaponry store, a joke shop, or even a lingerie shop without worrying about what your companions might think.Do not visit stores you are not permitted to. Shopping alone is a time to experience freedom from others’ timetables and wants, not a time to behave inappropriately or disobey a parent’s request.
 Ask about return policies, when new shipments come in, what types of clothing would fit your coloring or frame well, or even whether or not they like their job.


Although some sales staff will not have answers for you, they will likely find someone who does. If you are nervous buying new clothes or are unsure what to purchase for an event, get the input of an impartial third party. A friend is likely to sugarcoat opinions to spare your feelings.

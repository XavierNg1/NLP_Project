 Both are units of measurement in the metric system. 1 micrometer equals 1,000 nanometers., You should be given the number of nanometers you need to convert. If you are using measurements other than nanometers or micrometers, you would use different calculations and thus could not use this method.

For example, you might need to convert 14,500 nanometers to micrometers.
 When converting a smaller unit into a larger unit, you end up with less units than you started with. Thus, you need to divide.Since there is 1 micrometer per 1,000 nanometers, to find the number of micrometers, divide by 1,000.

For example, 14,500รท1,000=14.5{\displaystyle 14,500\div 1,000=14.5}. So, 14,500nanometers=14.5micrometers{\displaystyle 14,500\,{\text{nanometers}}=14.5\,{\text{micrometers}}}.

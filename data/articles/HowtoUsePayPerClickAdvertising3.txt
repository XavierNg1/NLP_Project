 This is the best way to test the success rate of certain keywords or advertisement headlines against others.
 If you are testing different keywords or products, then you can determine in a week or 2 which ads will work best for your company. Most PPC advertising programs let you track your progress daily on your account screen, as well as through sales on your own website.
 If you keep returning to your account to change wording, images or links, it will interrupt the gathering of data. It is better to fine-tune the ad by trying a few different search terms or wording choices and then shut down the ad when you can see what works best.
 Unless you do not sell products or services on your site, the success of an ad is determined by sales increases rather than by an increase in traffic.


If you are using the landing page to gather email addresses and communicate with a new database by email, then make sure you gather this data as well. It may take a few emails to this database to determine how many new leads were converted to customers.
 This can mean that you have not determined what keywords attract buyers, or it can mean that your product is not ideal for PPC advertising.

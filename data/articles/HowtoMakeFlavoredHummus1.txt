 Start by placing two cans of chickpeas into a food processor. Each can is approximately 15.5 ounces (440 grams) of chickpeas. You should run the processor until the beans are chopped into small pieces. This may take five to seven pulses.If using canned chickpeas, you should rinse and drain them first. If you are using dried chickpeas, prepare them before putting them in the food processor. Boil them until they are soft, usually an hour or two.
Chickpeas are also called garbanzo beans.;
, After your chickpeas are chopped, add the rest of the ingredients to the food processor bowl. Add two crushed garlic cloves, ¼ cup of tahini, 3 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil, ¾ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper.You can reduce or increase the amount of garlic to taste.
 After you have added everything, pulse everything in the food processor. Continue to combine it until the mixture is smooth and creamy. You may need to stop often to scrape the hummus from the sides of the bowl.You can keep this in refrigerator for up to a week.
 Though chickpeas are the traditional base for hummus, you can use black beans to make your hummus. Switch the two cans of chickpeas for two cans of rinsed and drained black beans. Keep the rest of the ingredients the same.Instead of using lemon, you can substitute lime juice in the black bean hummus.

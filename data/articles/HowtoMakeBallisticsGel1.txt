 This recipe will produced two blocks of ballistics gel that will work for pistol and rifle testing. This will simulate the effects of the bullet on soft tissue.;
, The key to good ballistics gel is the gelatin that you use. While you can order specialized gelatin, the cost can be very prohibitive. Knox brand Gelatine works very similar to the specialty gelatin, and can be found at most major grocery retailers.
 To make the gel, you will need a gallon of water for every 13 ounces of gelatin. This will give you about a 10% mix by weight, which will make for the best ballistics gel.


This recipe will be using 9 gallons (34.1 L) of water and 117 ounces of gelatin.
 For this recipe, you will have to cool the gel down to about 36 °F (2 °C). Make sure that your refrigerator can fit the container, or that you have a cool place such as a garage to set the gelatin.


It will need to set for at least 8 hours in a cold location, so be sure that you can afford to make that much room in your refrigerator for that long.

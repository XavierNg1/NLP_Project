 Make sure that the stain remover and water are thoroughly mixed.


This method is best used on bears with a voice box.
The oxygen stain remover will help get rid of any difficult spots, but a mild detergent will also work.
 Completely cover the spot with the water and stain remover liquid.
 Wait 5-10 minutes for the mixture to absorb, but donâ€™t let it dry completely.


Use small, circular motions to rub the mixture into the spot.
 If it is still visible, repeat the first four steps.


You can also use a paper towel for blotting.
Depending on the nature of each spot and how much the stain has soaked in, you may need to repeat the process.

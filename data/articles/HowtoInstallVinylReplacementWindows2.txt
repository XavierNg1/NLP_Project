 For all Welded Windows, snap angle to bottom of window frame.
 Set new window in opening to verify all correct measurements. Remove window from opening.
 You can use the rope from the weights (cut weight off the end) tied to the insulation to pull it up through the frame cavity.
 Also, add caulk to the outside blind-stops and along the top of the opening's header.
 A layer of insulation between the head expander and frame may be added if necessary. Expander legs may also be easily trimmed with a utility knife to accommodate various heights.

 By writing down the incident as you saw it, you can help to control and resolve the issue.Be as clear as possible about what happened, including:


How the incident began.
Who the bully was, and what they said.
How the victim responded.
What the end result was.
 Do not be nice or suck up to a group of colleagues who have bullied you. Bullying in the workplace is absolutely not ok, and there should be consequences for the people who think that it is ok to act in this way.


If you are simply nice to them and do nothing, they will think that you will not stand up to them, and may continue to bully you.
 If you have been the target of a bully, you may be experiencing some feelings of depression, isolation and helplessness. However, it is important to remember that you are not alone. Talk to family members or friends that you trust and ask them for advice.Another option is to ask a counselor, doctor, or spiritual leader about what they think you should do, and how they recommend you should handle the situation.
 If you are concerned about appearing vulnerable, and do not want to talk to your boss about the psychological harm the bullying has caused you, discuss the incident(s) in a matter of fact way, and show your boss how the bullying is having a negative impact on your work, and on the finances of the company.


For example, show your boss that bullying is a problem by explaining that the bully has refused to cooperate with you, and thus is preventing you from finishing your tasks on time, and causing the quality to drop.
 If you are being bullied, bring the issue up by personally discussing it with your manager or bringing it up in a meeting as soon as it occurs. If you do not report the situation as soon as it occurs, the bully has more time to continue the bullying, or cover up the bullying in the first place.


Ask the HR department about the policies they have in place to offer protection from retaliation by the bully.

 Sleepwalkers are deeply asleep during an episode, but their eyes do remain completely open during the entire event.If you are trying to successfully pull off a fake sleepwalk, keeping your eyes open is a must.;
, Even though their eyes are open, sleepwalkers aren’t really “seeing” during an episode. Their expressions remain totally vacant and their eyes are unfocused and dim.


Practice keeping your face expressionless and your eyes unfocused before you attempt to fake sleepwalking. You’ll need to maintain that blank look in front of the person you are faking out.
If this person tries to wake you up during your “episode”, and they probably will, you’ll have to keep a straight face while this is going on.
 During an episode, sleepwalkers are so dazed that they normally don’t react or respond to anyone who attempts to communicate with them. When you attempt your fake out, ignore anyone who speaks to you and do not initiate a conversation with anyone.
 Sleepwalkers are extremely difficult to wake up during an episode. Don’t “wake up” unless the other person exerts a ton of effort trying to get you to do so. Keep your expression blank and maintain your glassy eyed gaze at all times.

 If youâ€™ve purchased a whole kohlrabi with the leaves and stems, remove the leaves from the bulb. The leaves are edible.The leaves are similar in flavor and can be used like kale or spinach.
The leaves must be used a few days after they are removed from the bulb or else they will go bad.
 The stems of the kohlrabi, while edible, are not typically eaten and should be removed before storage. Only the bulb and leaves should be saved and used in cooking or enjoyed raw., Using warm water, scrub the kohlrabi bulb and remove any dirt or other residue.
 Once wrapped, you can put the kohlrabi into your fridge for later use.Bulbs that have been removed from their stems, scrubbed and wrapped in plastic can stay fresh in the fridge for up to two weeks.

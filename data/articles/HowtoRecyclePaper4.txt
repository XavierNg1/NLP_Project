 Ask them about their available recycling services, as well as any recycling centers in your area. Ask them for details on what can and cannot be recycled.
 Different areas have different policies on what they can accept, but here’s what generally will and will not be taken:


What you can recycle: Newspaper, magazines, maps, packaging, envelopes, cardboard.
What you can’t recycle: Waxed paper, laminated paper, pet food bags, food-soaked paper.
 If your waste management company offers recycling, then take your sorted recyclables out to the curb in the recycle bins on trash day.
 If your local sanitation company doesn’t support recycling, or you have too much to fit into a bin, pack up your recyclables and take them to your local recycling center.

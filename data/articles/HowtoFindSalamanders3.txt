 Looking for salamanders in the wild can be a lot of fun, but be sure you don’t stay in one place too long. Disturbing leaves and logs and trampling through the grasses in a concentrated area can cause habitat degeneration and may upset the salamander breeding populations., If you stumble upon a salamander breeding pool, avoid disturbing it. Watch from a distance so that you do not harm the salamanders or their eggs., If it isn’t necessary to handle a salamander, opt not to. The oils on human skin can be toxic to salamanders, and the salt and heat from human hands can be harmful to them.

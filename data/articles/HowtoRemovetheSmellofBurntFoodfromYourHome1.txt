 Once the burned item is fully cool, throw it away. Take all burned food, put it in a plastic bag, and put it in the garbage can outside of your house. Remove it from your home - don’t put it in the garbage disposal or in a garbage can in your kitchen. The smell will still continue to linger in the air.;
, Open the windows to let the smell out and bring fresh air in. This is the quickest and simplest way to get the air in your house circulating. Open up all of your windows and outside doors, especially near the kitchen.
 To help circulate the air more quickly, bring out all of the electric fans in your home and plug them in beside open windows and doors. Turn them on to the highest speed possible in order to get the air moving. If you have a kitchen fan/stovetop fan, turn that on too.
 Wash down all surfaces in rooms where the odor is noticeable. Use bleach or a disinfectant to clean the surfaces and to mop the floor. If the smell is very strong, wash the walls., Launder all items made of fabric from the rooms where the smell is noticeable. This includes table cloths, curtains, and slip covers. Use bleach if that won’t ruin the fabrics. If the smell permeated any cardboard boxes in the kitchen, move the contents of the boxes to plastic baggies and recycle the boxes.

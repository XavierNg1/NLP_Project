 Wear a static wrist guard if possible, or touch the metal case before handling anything inside, to ground any static charge you may have.;
, Overheating issues are also often caused by poor air circulation in the computer case. If you have space, adding another fan can help. Also, you should regularly open the case unplug all the cords and carefully take your computer system outside use a can of compressed air or an air compressor. A small vacuum is a good second choice but you have to be careful not to hit any internal components with it, and avoid touching the circuit boards with anything. Take your time and be very thorough with this step. Next take a cotton swab dabbed in some rubbing alcohol and go over the internal case components to get them very clean. You can go over the external case with a rag and a little bit of water. Allow your system 2 hours to dry out before turning it back on.

 It may be held in place on the motherboard by four Phillips screws or a lock-down lever.
 Often it is held in place by a small lever that lifts to release the processor.
 Dropping the processor will likely damage it. Alternatively, it may be stuck to the heat sink by thermal paste. Try to separate them. A credit card-type card can be useful for this step, but don't damage the CPU trying to pry them apart.
 Blast compressed air directly on the heat sink. It only takes a few good quirts to clean a blockage. If it's persistent, allow a few seconds before repeating.
 Use a clean cotton bud or paper towel. A little rubbing alcohol may help, but too much could cause damage.
, It only takes a small amount. Too much can cause overheating problems all over again.
 Clip the clip back in. Secure the fan back on. Plug it back into the motherboard.
 Make sure stray wires are secured away from fans, then put the cover back in place.

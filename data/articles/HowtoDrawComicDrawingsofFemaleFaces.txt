 If the character is young, a round or wider face may be more appropriate. If the character is more mature, use a more 'egg shape' face. The face shape may also depend on what kind of cartoon you are drawing.;
, As it is a female, the neck should be slim and petite. Depending on your characters age and style, the neck could be straight on both sides or with an inwards curve.
 This can be widely varied, and is completely up to you. Use light, smooth strokes for now.
 Do it roughly two thirds of the way down of the face you have left, and right in the middle, unless your character is looking to the side, in which case, you use a curved L shape at your chosen side. For the centre: As this is a cartoon, use a small curve, like the top half of a circle. Alternatively, you could use a light dash, but keep it small and simple!

, Is she smiling, laughing, frowning, crying? Add on the mouth in your chosen expression. Keep it light for now, it will be easier to rub out.
 The shape should reflect your characters emotion. Make them big and full of light reflections. This adds emotion and makes your drawing come to life.
 Don't press too hard at any point, and take your time!

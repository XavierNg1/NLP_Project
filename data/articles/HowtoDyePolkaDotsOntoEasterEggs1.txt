 Because you will be dipping the eggs into the dye, hallow or blown-out eggs are not recommended for this method. Be sure to let the eggs cool before moving on. White eggs are recommended, but you can try brown eggs for an interesting effect.;
, Pour Â½ cup (120 milliliters) of boiling water into a cup. Stir in 1 teaspoon of vinegar and 10 to 20 drops of food coloring. Repeat this step for each color you want to use.The more food coloring you add, the darker the color will become.
You can also use a simple Easter egg dyeing kit from the store. Prepare the dye according to the kit's instructions.
 You can use blank label stickers, confetti stickers, or even the small, round smiley-face stickers teachers use. Be sure to smooth down the edges of the stickers so that no dye gets underneath.Shiny stickers seem to resist the dye the best. Matte, paper stickers seem to let some of the dye through.
 Use a wire egg holder or a pair of tongs to gently set the egg into the dye. Leave the egg in the dye for 5 minutes.During this time, you can add round stickers over your other eggs for the other colors.


Be careful not to drop the egg, or it may crack.
 You can do this with a wire egg holder, a pair of tongs, or a small, slotted spoon. Hold the egg over the cup and let the excess dye drip off.
 Set the egg down some place where it won't tip or roll over; you can even use an egg holder. Once the egg is dry, peel the stickers off to reveal the white polka dots!


If you used brown eggs, the polka dots will be brown.
You can try to use a towel to dry the eggs, but be aware that this may give your egg some "texture".

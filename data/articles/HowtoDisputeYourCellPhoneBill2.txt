 If calling your service provider has not resulted in a satisfactory outcome, you can seek to resolve your billing dispute through binding arbitration. Cell phone contracts in the United States generally contain a provision allowing for binding arbitration. Arbitration proceedings are similar to court proceedings except arbitration is less formal and uses a third party known as an ‘arbitrator’ instead of a judge. The arbitrator gives an award after hearing evidence from both sides. The arbitrator’s decision is generally binding and subject to limited review by courts., Your contract will generally contain information about binding arbitration, but you can also access this information on your service provider’s website. Read this information carefully so that you know what procedure to follow if you are considering arbitration to resolve your dispute.

 Arbitrators can make a decision on written documents presented by both sides, and by doing so, you can avoid an in-person hearing. In-person hearings can be time consuming and inconvenient, and presenting a strong case by clearly setting out your arguments in a written document can be easier than doing so in an in-person hearing.

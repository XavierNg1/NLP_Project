 Obsessive compulsive disorder occurs alongside many other mental illnesses. Often, these conditions are related due to the basic way they manifest. OCD or the other condition may be misdiagnosed or undiagnosed due to the other condition. For example, children with Tourette’s syndrome with tics may be only diagnosed with OCD at first.Common co-occurring conditions include:Depression.
Anxiety disorders.
Mood disorders, such as bipolar.
ADHD.
Tourette’s syndrome.
Eating disorders.
Addictions, such as a gambling addiction.
PTSD.
 OCD commonly occurs with addiction or substance abuse. This is due to the similarities between the obsessions and compulsions and addiction. You may find that you have a drug or alcohol addiction connected to or occurring alongside your OCD. Symptoms of a co-occurring substance abuse problem includes:You use alcohol or drugs to deal with your anxiety, obsessions, or compulsions.
You think you are unable to control your OCD or moods without drugs or alcohol.
You cannot focus or get through your day without drugs or alcohol.
Your use of drugs and alcohol has had negative effects on your life, relationships, or job.
 Many people only receive treatment for their OCD and not the co-occurring disorder. This can lead to problems and symptoms from the other illness even if your OCD is being managed. Your quality of life may be reduced or you may not make the progress you should because the other condition isn’t being treated.Leaving the co-occurring disorder untreated can lead to unemployment, chronic health problems, unstable relationships, and isolation.

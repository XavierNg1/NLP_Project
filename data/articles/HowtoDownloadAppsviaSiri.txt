 Tap and hold the Home button to activate Siri. You can be at the home screen, lock screen, or in another application to launch Siri.


You will know it has launched when you hear two beeps.;
, You will want to put your mouth close to the Home button and clearly pronounce the sentence.


If Siri doesn’t understand you the first time, try repeating yourself slightly slower or more clearly.
 Siri will have to process what you just said, but once it finds the app in the App Store, you will be redirected to the App Store application.
 This will be a blue rectangular button directly to the right of the app details (title, developer).
 This will install the application onto your device.


If you get asked for your Apple ID password, make sure you enter it so you’ll be able to install the application on your device.
 Once the device finishes downloading and installing the app, you will be able to locate it on the home screen and use it as usual.

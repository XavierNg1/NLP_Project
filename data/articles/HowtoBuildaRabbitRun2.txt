 You'll need a cage kit, which comes with wire modular pieces. You'll also need some zip ties or hinges or a hammer and nails, available at most home improvement stores., Place two pieces next to each other. Use two zip ties, one at the top and one at the bottom, to bring the two pieces together. If the pieces aren't very high, you may need to make another layer on top. Use the zip ties to add the top layer as well. You want it to be 3 to 4 feet high., Continue adding pieces to the pen, until you have one that is an appropriate size. For instance, if your pieces are 2 feet wide, you'll need at least two pieces on each side and one piece on each end., The easiest way to create a door is to attach one panel only one side. That way, it will swing out, up, or down. You can keep it closed with a clip or clothespin., You may want to replace the zip ties with a hinge or metal j clips, which are more secure and more visually appealing. The zip ties can be helpful for keeping the cage in place while you work.


If you leave the zip ties, make sure they are facing outward. Your bunny is likely to chew on anything inside the cage, so point the ends of the zip ties outward. Make sure you pull them tight and clip off any excess.
 Use the same pieces to build a roof. Lay the piece on top, and attach on the sides and in the corner. Keep attaching the pieces to each other and the sides until you have a solid roof., If you plan on leaving bunnies in this run unsupervised outside, then you need to add wire pieces across the floor, too. Rabbits can burrow out from under the cage.However, you need a more solid floor for your rabbit's feet, so use either wood or a very thick layer of straw on the bottom.Indoors, you can use utility mats to cover the bottom instead of wire, as they won't burrow into your floor.

 Part of why it is simply not possible to wipe away your blackheads is because they are not caused by a buildup of dirt. Instead, they are created by a buildup of dead skin/sebum, which then reacts with oxygen and turns the substance in your pores black.As well, it is impossible to shrink, close or open your pores, as your pores are not muscles. They are simply holes that house the hair follicles and sebaceous glands on your body.
While some substances, like lemon or mint, can make your pores appear smaller, in reality your pores are not shrinking.
Other factors like genetics, age, and sun exposure all play a role in how large your pores appear, but there is no magic cure to making them shrink.
 Do this by washing your face no more than twice a day with a gentle facial cleanser that is oil free. Make sure you wash your face if you use makeup on a daily basis, as makeup residue can cause oil buildup on your face.Be sure to exfoliate your face with a natural or professional method and use a natural or commercial toner on a daily basis.
 Washing your pillowcases will remove any dead skin cells and oils your face leaves behind on the fabric every night., Hair can carry germs and bacteria that could end up on your face and/or nose.Avoid touching your face or nose with your hands. Your hands can carry dirt, germs and bacteria that can then end up on your face and cause a buildup of oil that can lead to blackheads.
 This can cause the skin on your nose to become inflamed, infected, and even cause scarring.As well, when using scrubs, avoid scrubbing your blackheads too hard as this can lead to irritation and inflammation.

 Brown the meat and place it into a slow cooker along with all the other copycat chili ingredients. Stir the chili well to combine the ingredients. Put the lid on the slow cooker and cook the chili on LOW for 6 to 8 hours or on HIGH for 4 to 6 hours.To help the chili thicken, you can leave the lid off of the slow cooker for the last hour of cooking.
 Replace the 2 cups (480 ml) of water called for in the copycat chili recipe with a flavorful liquid like stock. You could use beef, chicken, or vegetable stock. Or consider using one of these:


Wine
Beer
Tomato juice

, Although the copycat recipe calls for ground beef, you could use ground turkey or pork. Keep in mind that the ground turkey will make a leaner chili while the ground pork may make the chili greasier.


You can also combine different meats for more flavor. For example, use one pound of ground pork with one pound of lean ground beef.
 If you like the flavors and seasonings of the chili, but don't want to include the meat, make a few adjustments. Leave out the ground beef and use chopped mushrooms instead. You could also crumble in tempeh for a texture similar to meat.


For a vegetarian version, remember to use water or a vegetarian broth.

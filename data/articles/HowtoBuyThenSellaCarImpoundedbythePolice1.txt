Decide if attending a live auction is the right choice for you. Attending a live auction will allow you to see and inspect the cars. However, attending a live auction will take up more of your time than an Internet auction. The drive time and time spent at the auction will take up most, if not all, of a day. You will also need to make arrangements to get the vehicle home after it is purchased.
Browse the various Internet auction sites to determine if you want to attend an online auction. If you purchase a vehicle on the Internet, you can make all the bids from your computer. You won't need to worry about transporting the vehicle because it will be shipped to you. However, you will be relying on the information provided on the site regarding the condition of the vehicle. Unlike a live auction, there is no opportunity to inspect the vehicle.;
, Enforcement agencies will have information on when and where auctions are held. Agencies that impound vehicles also will put the information in your local newspaper.
 Some websites charge a fee for participating in vehicle auctions. When you find a site you like, register with the website.

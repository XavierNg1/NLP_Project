 While it may be tempting to find a good camping spot, the sniper rifle in Halo leaves a visible trail that will make even the stealthiest snipers vulnerable. Strafe around unpredictably to avoid getting shot and learn to predict the opponent's movements.
 When crouched, you halve the area for someone else to shoot at. And being a sniper, you don't really need to move that fast.
 Do NOT walk straight or head on into the enemy as that can get you easily sniped.
 A good location gives the sniper a wide open range to snipe targets from while eliminating the threat of surprise attacks from the behind or side. Use peripheral vision to watch your radar and be weary of sniper trails from the enemy. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!


Every time you enter a new open area, scan the perimeters quickly for potential targets or enemies.
 Remember which ones walk straight or predictably, remember which ones carry a sniper or is wearing an over-shield.

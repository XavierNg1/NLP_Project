 At the end of the day, there is no "perfect" amount to tighten your trucks. The tighter you turn the trucks, the more difficult the board is to turn. Too loose and you won't feel like you're stable, and your turns will be wide and difficult to control.The spot right in the middle of these extremes, your perfect tightness, is based on your own style and preference. Luckily, there is a large range of rideable tightness -- this isn't rocket science!Generally, tighter pins provide more resistance on turns, key for high-speed skating.
Looser pins have a more forgiving feel on turns and landings.;
, The amount the wheels tilt back and forth depends on how tight the trucks are. If you have a board (or a friend's board) that you like, test the tightness on them and try to replicate it in your own board. The amount they wobble right and left relates to how tight they are.
 This single bolt controls the tightness of the trucks. It points directly to the ground when you're skating, and is found between the wheels.








Turn it clockwise to tighten the trucks, getting tighter turning.
Turn it counter-clockwise to loosen the trucks, getting a softer turning feel.
 Don't just tighten the trucks and hit the skate park. After tightening, ride around a bit, trying a some turns, some ollies, and basic skating. Remember that there is no "right" tightness-- you need to find out what works for you.
 A hard day of riding will show you all the pros and cons of your new truck set-up. But that doesn't mean you need to be stuck with your set-up all day. A skate tool is small and easy to carry. Bring it along and make adjustments as needed.

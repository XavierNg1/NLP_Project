 If your baby is over six months old, it’s time to begin solid foods. Any earlier, and babies’ heads and necks tend to not be strong enough to support swallowing solids. Some foods are particularly good when weaning your baby. Weaning foods are complementary in nature — that is, they complement mother’s milk. The basic purpose of introducing these foods is: a) to provide taste and variety to the baby’s diet; b) to provide the “missing” nutrients; c) to teach the baby swallowing, chewing and eating skills; and d) to habituate the baby to the exact taste and flavor of home meals.Begin with liquids, then go on to semi-solids and finally to normal home foods. By the age of ten months, the baby should be eating an almost full diet.
Most pre-made baby foods have "stages" of foods to help you decide which foods to start with. Many parents start with rice or other grain cereals and go on to vegetables or fruits next.
 He is still learning to chew/swallow the food, and there will be times when the baby seems to be “refusing” the food, or even “throwing” it back out, when actually, he is just unable to co-ordinate his mouth and tongue movements sufficiently enough to put the food inside.


Start with just one to two tablespoons of solid food and increase over time as you baby wants more.
 Give this food daily for the first three to four days. Ensure that she is able to eat it, digest it and remain free from any allergic symptoms like coughing, loose bowel movements, or rashes. After the four days or so are up, start with another new item. A food item that does not agree with the baby can be re-tried after some weeks as long as it doesn't cause hives, wheezing, swelling, or trouble breathing.


In cases of families with a history of food allergies, atopic eczema, drug intolerance etc, new foods should be tried with caution.

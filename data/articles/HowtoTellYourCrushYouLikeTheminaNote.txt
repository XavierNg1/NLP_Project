 Plan out what you want to write, how you want to express it, what you're going to write on, etc. You simply can't say that you like them and leave it at that. Write some rough drafts until you get an idea of what to say.;
, Ink pen or pencil, along with paper, of course! Additionally, you can get some stickers together to add some style to your note. Heart stickers are always a good option! A good idea for your note is to use red or pink paper to remind your crush about Valentine's Day!

, Fold the paper the way you want, add the stickers, whatever you want! Try to add little details that are romantic to set the mood.
 Use your best handwriting! No one wants a note that they cannot read due to such sloppy handwriting. Be nice and write nicely so your crush doesn't have to strain their eyes to read your poor penmanship.
 Would you like to stick it in their locker, have a friend pass it to them, or drop it off as you say your daily hello to them? Either way, find out a way to give it to them and stick to your plan.
 You only live once. You never know, your crush could like you back. If you back out now and they DID like you, their feelings will soon fade off if they get the impression that you do not feel the same way. Also, it's not like writing them a note looks like a lame way to confess your feelings. It's a perfectly normal way to do it.
 They might not feel the same way, but it's always nice to know that you don't have to worry about holding in your feelings forever.
 If they say they don't feel the same way, then respect them for that. You can't expect someone to like you back just because you like them! If they do feel the same way, try asking them to meet up with you sometime. Wink when you suggest it so they get the right idea.

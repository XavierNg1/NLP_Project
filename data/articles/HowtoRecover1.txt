 Your doctor or physical therapist has years of experience helping people come back from injuries, and they can give you specific advice to help you feel better.;
, Even if you feel better, you need to complete your prescription or risk new infections. Many "super-bugs," like MRSA, are the result of people skipping the last few days of their drugs. This gives any remaining bacteria a chance to become immune to the drug, making them harder to fight later.
 The most important thing you can do to recover is nothing at all. You need to give your body time to get better without risking further injury.


After serious injuries, sleep is your best friend. Stay in bed, getting out once or twice a day to stretch and move around.
 You aren't going to be back in your normal routine the day after intense physical trauma. You need to be honest with yourself and work on the small things before moving on to bigger, more complex tasks. Focus on getting the little things right and the big things will follow in time.


Go for a short walk each morning, extending it by 1-2 minutes every day.
Read the newspaper or try out the crossword to keep your mind active and engaged with the world.
Ask a loved one to accompany you on small errands or tasks to help you and look out for future injuries.
 If you can't wait to get back on the basketball court, talk to you doctor about the steps you need to take to make it possible. Having a tangible end goal for your recovery makes it much easier to commit to getting better.


Be realistic -- start with small goals before getting bigger.
Celebrate milestones you've crossed, as this makes you more excited to keep working.

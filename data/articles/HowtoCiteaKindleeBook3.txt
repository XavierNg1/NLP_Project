 With a Chicago Style citation, start off with the author's name. You will list the last name, followed by a comma, then the first name. Then, add a period. For example, "Woolf, Virginia.", From here, state the title of the book. Make sure the title is in parenthesis, and follow the title with a period. For example, "Woolf, Virginia. Mrs. Dalloway.", From here, you'll have to add publication details. You can find this information on the site where you purchased or borrowed the book, and it may also appear on the first few "pages" you scroll through on your screen. You should add the city, followed by a colon. Then, add the publisher, followed by a comma, and the year published.Your source would now read, "Woolf, Virginia. Mrs. Dalloway. New York City: Houghton Mifflin Hartcourt Publishing, 1953."

, As with APA citation, how you cite an e-book in Chicago Style depends on where you accessed the book. When working from an online database, you should either list the URL of the database or the DOI. Remember, the DOI is the series of numbers, dashes, and periods that identify a book in an online library.If you're using a DOI, your citation may look something like, "Woolf, Virginia. Mrs. Dalloway. New York City: Houghton Mifflin Hartcourt Publishing, 1953, doi: 123.3456/2355/2345".
If there is not a doi included, you can simply include the URL of the online library where you checked out the book. For example, "Woolf, Virginia. Mrs. Dalloway. New York City: Houghton Mifflin Hartcourt Publishing, www.onlinelibrary.com".
 If you bought a book online, or read it for free, you simply need to add the URL where you bought or read the book to the end of your citation. For example, "Woolf, Virginia. Mrs. Dalloway. New York City: Houghton Mifflin Hartcourt Publishing, amazon.com."

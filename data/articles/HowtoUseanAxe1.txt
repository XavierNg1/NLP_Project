Stand over the large piece of wood.
Swing the axe to chop into the wood at a 45-degree angle.

Bring the axe up over your left and right shoulder, switching from 1 side to the other as you alternate bringing the axe down on each side of the target spot on the wood.
Glide the hand that lies close to the blade down towards the end of the handle as you swing the axe.
Bring the top hand down the handle to meet the bottom hand by the time you have finished the swing.
Aim your swing for the top, middle and bottom portion of each side of the spot where you are cutting the wood.
Repeat this swing pattern until you have chopped through the wood.

 Heat stimulates oil production, so avoid blow drying.It’s also a good idea to avoid flat irons, curling irons, and hot rollers if serious oiliness is a concern.
 Running your hands through your hair and otherwise playing with your hair spreads oil from the scalp to the rest of your hair. It may also stimulates oil production at the roots.Touching your hair is also problematic because it transfers oils from your hands (from things such as lotion or anything you've eaten) to your hair.The same goes for brushing: every time you drag the brush down your head, you’re pulling oil from the roots through the rest of your locks. Obviously you need to brush when you’ve got tangles or pesky fly-aways, but try to resist those 100 strokes a day.
 These products help to get rid of oiliness at the roots, and they can increase volume.They’re a great option for non-shampoo days.


Dry shampoo is great for occasional hair help, but you shouldn’t use it every day. It can block hair follicles and make it difficult for the sweat glands on your head to properly do their job.Cornstarch, cornmeal, and blotting papers work similarly to dry shampoo, soaking up excess oil in between washes., Styling products with silicone or a high concentration of oil can make your hair look greasy, so read ingredient labels carefully and choose alternate stylers.

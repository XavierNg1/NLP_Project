 Regis is an all boys high school.;
, In order for your application to be accepted for review a copy of the applicants baptismal certificate must be included.
 Only students with high standardized test scores are allowed to apply. The CO-OP (or now the TACHS) is not required for an application and Regis is NOT to be listed as one of the three choices put down on the test.
 You want to not just receive from the school but give to the student community there. Also express interest in public service and serving others. They want you to be someone who will get involved there. You should buy a test prep book for the HSPT. The one from KAPLAN is recommended by some.
 Regis High School issues the HSPT, or the High School Placement Test. This test always occurs on the first Saturday of November. It is similar to the Specialized High School Admissions Test for schools like Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech. There are usually around 1000 applicants taking the test for 230 interview spots. Only students who score in the upper quartile and higher are asked to return for an interview. The test is very tightly timed and requires quick and accurate decisions about your answers.
 The final step (assuming you get this far) is the interview. These are usually conducted on the first weekend of January. Each of the 230 interviewees has a 20 minute interview with a Regis faculty member and immediately after are interviewed for another 20 minutes by a Regis Alumnus or Board Member. Don't worry if you're nervous, everyone is. Know that the people who are interviewing you truly want to help you get in; they want to learn about who you are, so be honest. Don't worry about saying the wrong thing. Do, however, engage them. Ask questions, and be as front-footed as you can.
 The results are mailed out around the same time as those of other Catholic high schools. The freshmen class is usually about 135 students, but by senior year it's usually around 120.

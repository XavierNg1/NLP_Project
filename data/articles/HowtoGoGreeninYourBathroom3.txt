 Using reusable products will help eliminate the amount of waste that goes in and out of your bathroom. Examples of reusable products you can use are rags and towels for cleaning as opposed to paper towels, and toilet-bowl brushes that can be used repeatedly instead of just one time.
 For example, use toilet paper made from recycled materials, and hand- and body-towels made from organic cotton or bamboo, since conventional cotton is manufactured using a variety of pesticides and other chemicals.
 This can prevent you from being exposed to the chemical odors and gases that typically reside in most shower curtains made from PVC plastic.
 You can replace standard light bulbs with energy-efficient light bulbs, or remove some light bulbs from the row of bulbs above your vanity to save energy.
 These types of products are better for your overall health and for the environment; whereas many commercial toiletry items including soap, toothpaste, shampoo, shaving gel, and feminine products contain chemicals and other toxins.

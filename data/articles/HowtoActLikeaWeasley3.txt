 Bill was good at Quidditch, and so was Charlie. Percy was not a sports lover, although he bets on the outcome of matches. Fred and George were fir, Ginny and Ron were known for loving Quidditch and later in their Hogwarts years they made it onto the Quidditch team!

, All the Weasleys had a Â lot of friends. If you want a new student to know that you are like a Weasley say. " I am _______ (full name). Who are you. I hope we will be friends, and that we will never argue.". This will make them see your friendly side.
 Percy became minister, Ronald became prefect, Ron mentioned Fred and George had "really nice marks", and Ginny was very smart for her age. Always work hard in school, and get to be intelligent. Don't work too hard or you'll become a Ravenclaw.
 The Weasleys were supportive. Laugh with them, tell them about your problems, and even act as though they were friends. Your family can be there for a while, so stick together(although arguing siblings is common in the Weasley household)

, Even Percy joked a lot. Always laugh, and keep your humour up. Tell jokes, and play funny pranks. Always laugh if you make a mistake, and don't be a perfectionist. All the Weasleys have flaws!

, Since you are the top of your class, you might want to help others. Start a homework club and work it out together. Be loyal to you friends while you are doing this.
 The Weasleys went to Hogwarts, and they all loved it, especially Ginny did! Enjoy!

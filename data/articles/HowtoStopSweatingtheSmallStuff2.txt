 Physical activity will relieve stress and improve your mood. In fact, a person only needs 30 minutes of exercise a day to feel the psychological and emotional benefits of physical activity.Activities like running, hiking and swimming, as well as playing sports like tennis, cause your brain to release endorphins which will give you a natural “high.” Even small amounts of exercise can improve your mood in this way.
Focusing on a single physical activity clears the mind and might be considered a type of meditation., Just like exercise, a little relaxation on your own can go a long way. As little as ten minutes a day of uninterrupted alone time can calm your mind and relax the physical stresses that come with frustration and worry.


Make sure to put away your phone, tablet, laptop and any other device that might interrupt your relaxation and cause more minor stresses., People who are stressed out take quick, shallow breaths, causing even more stress. Deep breathing from the diaphragm (diaphragmatic breathing) can slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure, as well as increase oxygen exchange.


Lay down in a quiet room and breath normally. Next, take a slow, deep breath through your nose, filling your chest and abdomen with air. Slowly breath out through your mouth. Repeat this until you feel the stress begin to slip away.
Chest breathing has been somewhat normalized in particular cultures because of body image pressures, as people tend to keep their stomachs sucked in. Breathing from the diaphragm is a much more effective way to combat stress., Mindfulness meditation has been shown to help people deal with stress and anxiety. This type of meditation can teach you to identify intrusive, unproductive thoughts and recognize them for what they are: just thoughts.

 Some cleaners must be mixed with a carpet cleaning solution, while others just require the addition of water. Follow all instructions carefully, and be sure you don't dilute the concentrate by adding too much water.


Make sure the floor is entirely dry from the pre-cleansing the day before before you begin applying the enzymatic cleaner.
 You want to work in small sections of about 3x3 feet. Use enough of the solution that there is standing water on the area for at least 10 minutes. Add more solution if the area begins to dry out--again, it is essential the liquid permeate every layer and ever pore of the cement so it can break down the uric crystals.For easier application, use a clean deck or household sprayer. Using a dirty sprayer will cause whatever residue (like mildew or dirt) to be sprayed into the absorbent concrete and may result in another bad smell.Be especially aggressive in areas where you noted the urine stain with the UV light. You may want to get a scrub brush and use that to really work the enzymatic cleaner into those areas.The most heavily marked areas may bubble. Take note of these areas, as you may need to treat them again if the smell persists.Repeat the process until you have treated the entire floor.
 To prolong this process and give the enzymatic solution more time to work, you can cover the floor with a plastic tarp. This will slow the evaporation rate of the solution.If the smell persists, treat any of the heavily soiled areas with another round of enzymatic cleaner.
 This will make your floors much easier to clean in the future and usually looks more attractive.

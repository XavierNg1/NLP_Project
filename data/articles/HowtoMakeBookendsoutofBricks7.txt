 Make a house, a face, your dog, a car––nearly any design can be made using liquid nails (or silicone adhesive) and found objects.


Check out a hobby store for small dollhouse pieces. Re-create a tiny library on the outside of each brick by purchasing a dollhouse bookshelf, chair and even a few doll book. Glue the bookshelf to the back of the brick and then affix the chair and other books to the side. You could even sit a small doll in the chair reading a book for extra interest.
Design a modern looking face or architectural structure using basic children’s blocks. Create interest by using a variety of color and shapes on each brick backing.

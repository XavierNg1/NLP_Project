 As soon as you do this, the pages' updates will appear as part of your home page feed. You can comment on interesting posts, in order to become part of a professional conversation and network with people.


Think of some keywords for your industry. Search for them in the top search bar. When your results appear, click on "groups" instead of "all results," and you will find options of groups to join. Look at the group, and join groups if they list their members' profiles, list job postings and have good discussions about industry topics.
In some cases, the group administrators will check your page before admitting you to the group. Click the "Ask to Join" button to the right of the group name.
 If you have interesting discussions with people in your group, you will soon find people in your region who would be good professional contacts. Introduce yourself by a personal message.
 You can also build small business networks this way. Only do this if you are prepared to spend extra time being a group administrator, suggesting topics of discussion and posting industry articles.
 You can add the LinkedIn application to your profile, and people will be able to click on it to see your resume and experience. A potential client, employer or professional may choose to connect with you through LinkedIn, rather than Facebook.

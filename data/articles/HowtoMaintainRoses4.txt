 Talk to your local garden center to help find roses that will survive and thrive in your climate. If you live up north, for example, you'll need to find a hearty, heavy rose that can survive winter. Southerners need a rose that can handle humidity and heat. Since there are so many rose varieties to choose from, it should not be too difficult to find one that matches your needs, but don't just go in believing any rose can survive anywhere -- they are all very different plants.
 Grab a soil test from you local garden store and use it to check out your garden's dirt. It should be at a pH range between 5.5-7.0 for the best rose growth.


If you soil is too acidic (low pH), you can add finely grown limestone to the soil and test again.If the soil is too alkaline, or basic (high pH), you can add ground sulfur to the soil.
 Don't plant roses in sandy, loose soil or firm, hard-packed dirt. Roses need a deep, lightly packed area of soil to really thrive. The dirt shouldn't keep it's moisture for a long time, as this can drown the roots. Make sure your garden can drain excess water out.


Aim for higher ground in your garden, where there is plenty of room for draining water.
If the soil is relatively easy to dig into, without feeling like sand, it is likely fine for roses., Roses are full-sun plants, so put them somewhere they will get ample sunlight throughout the day, which will lead to bigger, better blooms.In general, south facing walls and areas provide the most sunlight.
 This will help them get off on a good foot, providing necessary nutrients as the plant establishes itself in the soil. You can find many fertilizers specially formulated for roses, or you can go the old fashioned way.


Want to avoid fertilizer and manure? Consider planting your roses with a small square of gypsum and an iron nail -- providing two nutrients needed for growth.

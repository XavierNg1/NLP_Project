 There is currently no way to select multiple photos and delete them all at once. You have to manually delete each photo using the Instagram app, no matter which way you go about it. That being said, you can use your computer to make deleting each photo through the Instagram app a little easier.;
, Browsing through your available photos and marking them for deletion will be a lot easier on a computer as opposed to on your phone. You can open your profile by entering https://instagram.com/username.
 You'll need to be logged in with your Instagram account in order to proceed with marking your images.
 For ease, open each one in a new tab in your browser by holding Ctrl and clicking the picture. You can also right-click an image and select "Open in a new tab". This will open each image in a separate tab.
 Come up with a hashtag that isn't being used by anyone else, and add it to each image you want to delete. For example, you could add "#deleteme2015119abcd" to the Comment section of each one. This will allow you to quickly search for all of the photos with this hashtag in the app.
 After you've marked your images with your unique hashtag, log into the Instagram app on your mobile device. You can only delete images using your mobile device.
 Open the Search section of the app and switch the search to "Hashtags". Type in the unique hashtag you created and all of the images you marked will appear.
 Tap the first photo on the list. Scroll down and tap the Options (...) button. Tap Delete, and then tap Delete again. Repeat this for each photo that you want to remove.

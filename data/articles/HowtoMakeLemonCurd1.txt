 It's much easier to juice a zested lemon than it is to zest a juiced lemon. Here are some ways to do this:


The first way is to use a lemon zester. This is a handy tool, built with the express purpose of peeling the skin off lemons and limes.
Another way to do this is with a fine-toothed grater. The advantage to this is that rather than having long strips of skin to then chop fine, the grater does all that in the process of grating.
A third method is paring. With a paring knife or vegetable peeler, peel away strips of lemon skin.
If you use a peeler, make sure you trim off any of the white pith before proceeding—it's very bitter.
Mince the lemon zest, until you have 1 tablespoon of lemon zest—about 1 lemon.;
, A regular hand juicer should get you about 2 tablespoons of juice from one lemon. If you find you're not getting enough juice, try rolling the lemon firmly on a hard surface to break up the tissue and release more juice, or microwave it for 10 seconds to warm it up.
 Combine the Whisk eggs, sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a small saucepan, and whisk together until well-blended.
 Stir in the butter with a spoon, and mix until smooth.
 Do not bring to a boil. Over low heat, gently bring the mixture barely to a simmer (small bubbles occasionally rising to the surface). Cook, stirring constantly, for about 15 minutes or until the mixture thickens.
 Pour into small glass jars, custard cups, or small bowls, and store in the refrigerator.

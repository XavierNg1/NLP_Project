 Last years fashions will be less costly than current ones, while still being fashionable enough not to be outdated.
 Purchase out of season clothing with the intent of being able to wear it by the end of your pregnancy. For example, if you find out you are expecting at the beginning of the summer, thereâ€™s a good chance that shops will have their winter items, which you will need by your third trimester, on clearance. You can grab some great bargains by stocking up on your third trimester items now.
 Generally, women who spend more on their maternity clothing will try to get some type of recoup back by reselling their clothing at consignment shops. This is a great way to purchase quality items for less money.
 Many times, women donate perfectly good items that they no longer have a use for to thrift shops. You can find gently used clothing that has been donated because it never fit correctly or was uncomfortable for one reason or another to the previous owner.
 This will get you through a few more months of non- maternity clothes before you have to make the leap to maternity clothing. These items may be useful after the baby is born as well, if it takes you a little while to lose the baby weight.

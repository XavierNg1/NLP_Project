 You can get there on foot either from Route 4 through the desert or via the Skyarrow Bridge.Make sure you have a Pokéball, an open space in your party, and a Celebi in your party.
 Game Freak HQ is a black building on the right side of Castelia Street, the east-most of the city's four radial streets. Coming off the Skyarrow Bridge simply turn down the first street that opens to your right.
 There will be a boy and a girl standing in front of a bar in the first room you see upon entering. The boy is the one on the left. Walk up and talk to him. If you have Celebi in your party, it will pop out, and the boy will say "Yip yap!" and reveal himself to be Zorua in disguise. The girl standing next to him will suggest that Celebi and Zorua are good friends and that Zorua would like to go with you., A box will pop up asking if you would like to add Zorua to your party. Select yes.
 Any kind of poké ball will do. Zorua will go into the ball and join your party!

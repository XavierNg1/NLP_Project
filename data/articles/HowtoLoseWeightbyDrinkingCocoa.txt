 Drinking chocolate is cocoa powder mixed with vast quantities of sugar, and it won't help you lose any significant amount of weight. You can find cocoa powder in the baking section of your local supermarket. If you're in Britain or Australia, purchase Cadbury Bourneville Cocoa. It has a soothing, mildly bitter flavour. If you're in the United States, Nestle or Hersheys.;
, Pour a level tablespoon of cocoa powder into a cup. Fill the cup with hot water, stir the cocoa with the tablespoon and give it a few minutes to cool, then drink it. Do NOT add sugar or milk, as these will reduce the appetite suppressant effect. The cocoa will taste bitter, but not unpleasant. You will find your appetite for food is immediately reduced.
 This is "cocoa fasting." The cocoa powder itself contains a reasonable amount of high quality protein, and because its caffeine content is lower than coffee or tea, you can safely consume about four ounces/125 grams of cocoa powder a day.
 If you're doing the full fast, then take vitamin pills. If you're just trying to reduce your food intake without drastic measures, then try having cocoa in between meals, before and after meals to reduce the amount of food you eat. Make sure you drink a lot of water, and eat plenty of fresh fruit.

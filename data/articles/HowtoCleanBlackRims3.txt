 Once you've washed and rinsed the wheels, make sure to dry them off well, using a dry towel or rag. That way, you pick up any grease left on the rim so that it won't attach itself to the microfiber cloth in next stage., Usually, you'll spray on a spray wax, such as Final Finish. This finish has wax, of course, but it also contains other additives. The additives are important because they help the finish stay on the wheels for longer than just plain wax.Alternatively, you can use a rub-on wax. Either way, consider using a black wax to keep the wax from leaving white streaks on your black wheels.In fact, if your wheels are a clear gloss painted surface, you can use a black wax like you would use on your car. However, it's best to only use a black wax if your rims are glossy, not matte., If you're using a spray-on wax, be sure to use a piece of cardboard or paper to shield the brake pad from the wax, then spray on the wax. For a rub-on wax, use a clean microfiber cloth to rub the wax in.For both kinds of wax, smear it on first, making sure you get it all over the wheel, as well as in all the crevices. Then, with a clean side of the microfiber cloth, buff out any smears, making it shiny.However, if you're using black spreadable wax on glossy wheels, try to avoid getting it in the crevices. Just use an applicator sponge to rub it gently over the surface of the wheel, making sure to get a solid coat.

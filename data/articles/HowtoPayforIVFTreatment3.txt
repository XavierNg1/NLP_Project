 Crowdsourcing, or crowdfunding, is a way to raise small amounts of money towards a specific goal. It is becoming an increasingly popular way to defray the costs of IVF treatments, especially because people generally enjoy helping others.Most donors will be family and friends. You may also pick up a few donors you don’t know at all.Crowdfunding may be a good option to pay for your IVF if:


You’re comfortable with everyone—family, friends, the general public—knowing about your infertility struggles.
You’re comfortable asking people you know and don’t know for money
You don’t have enough connections or relationships to raise the money you need

, An older way to raise funds that is similar to crowdfunding is hosting some type of benefit to raise funds for your IVF. Keep in mind that, like crowdsourcing, this brings others into your private life. Consider throwing the following to help defray the costs of IVF if you are comfortable:


Bake sale
Benefit dinner
Benefit race, such as a 5K run/ walk
Selling candy bars

, One of the easiest ways to raise money is find an additional source of income. Finding part time work, doing jobs from home, and asking your employer for extra hours may help you get closer to your goal of paying for IVF more quickly.
 Many people own larger homes than they need or have too many things around the house they don’t use. Take some time to figure out where you can downsize your life to save money for your IVF treatments. This might include getting a smaller home, getting rid of extra cable channels, or trading in your car for a less expensive monthly payment.


Consider selling valuables you don’t use. For example, you may have valuable jewelry or collectibles that sit and gather dust. Use the proceeds from the sale of such items towards your IVF treatments.
Combine all of your savings and put it in an account set up specifically for your IVF.

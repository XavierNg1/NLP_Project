 To add a French bustle, start by measuring the center back seam of the gown’s train from the waist to the floor. Then measure the distance from the edge of the train to the base of the dress.Mark the place between these two distances with a pin.
 Lift the center back seam where you made the pin mark and position it against the center of the waistline, at the base of the bodice. Adjust the fold so the train is between ½” to ¾” (1.3 – 2 cm) off the floor.Pin the train to the waistline seam.
Lift the sides of the train off the floor ½” to ¾” (1.3 – 2 cm) and fold and pin the train along each side of the back seam.
To lift the remaining train off the floor, continue to fold and pin the train as necessary between the seams.
 Undo all the pin-marking points you have made on the train and waistline of the dress. Sew a length of narrow grosgrain ribbon measuring 15” (38 cm) to the waistline of the dress, using the pin marks as a guide.The ribbon should fall between the lining of the skirt and the dress’s train.
Make sure to sew the ribbon securely into the waistline seam.
 Cut 2 1/2“ (6.5 cm) of the ribbon before folding it in half and stitching the ribbon loop to the underside of the dress’s train. Make the loop stronger by reinforcing it with a small piece of interfacing, or by attaching the loop to the seam allowances of the dress.Loops should be attached ½” (1.3 cm) below each pin mark.
Repeat the same process for all other loops.
 Attach each ribbon to the corresponding loop by inserting the ribbon into the loop and tying a double bow. Plump up the fabric to make the bustle look bigger and to provide more volume.The French bustle is great for dresses with lots of train decoration centered below the waist because the bustle won’t hide the designs.The French bustle is also ideal for dresses with long trains or that are made of heavier fabrics.

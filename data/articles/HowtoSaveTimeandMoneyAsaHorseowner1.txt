 If you can keep an eye on sales throughout the year and know what you're going to need ahead of time, you can find great bargains when the sales are on. Items such as feed, wormers, gear and supplements will be on specials at different times through the year and knowing what you need can allow you to stock up when the sales are on.


When winter coats are on special, for example, buy them even though winter is several more seasons away. The horse isn't fussed about fashion statements.;
, Friends and trusted fellow horse owners may be able to sell you their used items at a fraction of their original cost. Another way to get great secondhand gear is to look at online sellers who have excellent reputations.
 Organize an event for fellow horse owners in your area to bring unwanted, surplus or secondhand gear along to trade. This can include horse equipment, riding gear, clothing and maintenance gear. You can either do direct exchanges or pay small amounts of cash to make it fair when there are no exact trades for one party.


Clean any gear you're putting into a swap-meet. You'll want the items to look appealing and in great condition.

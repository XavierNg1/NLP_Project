 While most dogs will be okay with you cleaning gunk from their eyes, others might not. If your dog is especially sensitive, try cleaning her eyes with the help of another person. Have someone with whom the dog is familiar hold your pet while you clean the dog’s eyes.
 If your dog’s eye discharge isn’t caused by a serious medical condition like epiphora or conjunctivitis, you can clean the gunk with a damp, soft cloth or sponge. Using water that is at room temperature, wet the cloth and wring it out so it remains damp but is not overly saturated.Avoid using extremely hot or cold water as this can cause further irritation in your dog’s eyes.
Don’t use a napkin or paper towel as both can disintegrate when wet and leave harmful bits of paper in your pooch’s eyes.
 Using the moistened washcloth or sponge, gently clean the discharge from your dog’s eyes using several gentle strokes. If necessary, you can rinse and wring the cloth between strokes.
 In the majority of cases, you should not use any type of detergent, soap, or shampoo when cleaning gunk from your dog’s eyes. This can cause irritation for your pet. Instead, you should stick to water and avoid cleansers altogether., If your pet is suffering from a chronic or serious condition that causes excessive eye discharge, your vet may recommend using sterile pet eyewash to clean your dog’s eye. Gently moisten the cotton ball or pad with the solution, taking caution to not soak it. Start at the inner corner of the eye and wipe outward.Use a new cotton ball or pad for each eye, as using the same one for both eyes can spread bacteria, viruses, and infection between the two eyes.

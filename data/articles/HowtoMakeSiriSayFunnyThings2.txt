 Say "Call me Mr. President from now on" and Siri will refer to you by that name until you change it.
 Siri will try to interpret most "where" questions as a serious request, which can give you pretty silly results:


Siri, where can I hide the bodies?
Where did they hide the weapons of mass destruction?

, See what Siri makes of these:


Siri, do you speak duck?
What's your favorite ice cream flavor?
Does this dress make me look fat?
What should I be for Halloween?

, If you have the heart for it, try insulting Siri. Don't be surprised if she gets offended.

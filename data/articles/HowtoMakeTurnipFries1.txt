 Add 1 cup (150 g) of fine plain white cornmeal, 1 cup (125 g) of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons (12 g) of kosher salt, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of black pepper to a large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together so they’re well blended.If you like, you can add other seasonings to the coating for the turnip fries. Garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and paprika are some options to consider.;
, Pour 2 cups (473 ml) of whole buttermilk into a large bowl. Add ¾ pound (340 g) of peeled turnips that have been cut into ⅓-inch (8-mm) thick sticks to the milk and toss well so they’re completely coated.If you don’t have buttermilk, use 2 cups (473 ml) of regular milk with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of lemon juice mixed into it.
 After you’ve coated the turnip sticks in the buttermilk, place them in the cornmeal mixture. Toss them in the cornmeal until the turnip fries are completely coated, and place them on a plate or baking sheet lined with foil or parchment paper., Fill a large skillet with ¼-inch (6-mm) of canola oil, and place it on the stove over medium heat. Allow the oil to heat for 5 to 7 minutes.You can substitute peanut or vegetable oil for the canola if you prefer.
 Once the oil is heated, add the turnip fries to the skillet in batches. Cook them until they are golden brown, which should take approximately 5 minutes.Turn the fries occasionally with a spatula as they’re frying to ensure that they cook evenly.
 Use a slotted spoon to lift the turnip fries out of the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towel. Allow the fries to drain for 2 to 3 minutes on the paper towel before transferring them to a platter. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons (6 g) of fresh, chopped chives over them and serve.You can serve the turnip fries with ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce.

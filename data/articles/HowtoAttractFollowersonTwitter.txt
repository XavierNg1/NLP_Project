 The most attractive feature of a Twitter account is a complete profile. A complete Twitter profile makes it easier for people to identify what your account is all about. Tap the “Profile” button on the top right corner of the web page or from Twitter’s mobile app’s screen to view your profile page and complete any information you find missing.;
, Constantly posting tweets will make sure that your name stays on top of the newsfeed of your followers. Your Twitter followers will likely share your status to their subscribers if they keep on seeing you actively posting—which, in turn, could follow you too.


Besides constantly posting, make your tweets interesting by using media or information that’s relevant to your target followers. For example, if you’re trying to attract car enthusiasts, post any car-related topics or tips to attract this set of followers.
 Topics in Twitter are commonly identified and grouped by putting a hashtag (#) before the start of the topic title (e.g., #weather). Putting topics in hashtags on your tweets will allow your post to be viewable by the general public, especially when that topic becomes trending.


Using hashtags of already-trending topics will increase the chances of people subscribing to your account because your name and your tweet will appear on the list of related posts about a certain trending topic.
 Your followers can reply to the tweets you post. When you see people responding to your status posts, interact with them by giving a quick tweet-back. This will let people know that your profile is authentic and not just operated by an auto-post software, making it more engaging and encouraging other users to follow you.
 When people start to follow your Twitter account, be courteous and follow them back. This way, your profile can be exposed to their subscribers as well, which can attract followers to your account too.

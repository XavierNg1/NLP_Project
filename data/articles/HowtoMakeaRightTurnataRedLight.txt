 Do not swerve into the right lane, or cut anyone off (abruptly move into the lane without adequate room).


If you cannot get into the right lane, do not attempt to turn on red.;
, If your turn signal is still on, you can leave it on. You can also turn it off briefly before signalling your turn.


For the safety of drivers and bicyclists around you, you should never begin your turn without signalling.
 In some states, you cannot turn on red if there is a red right arrow, so check your state laws.Many cities also have laws in addition to, or separate from, state laws. Make sure you know all the laws in your city.
 If there is a crosswalk, stop at the crosswalk. Otherwise, stop at the limit line.


You must stop completely before making your turn. Do not coast through the turn, even if all appears to be clear. , Pedestrians crossing always have the right of way. Cyclists may also be coming behind you. If there is a bike lane, you must signal and enter it just as you would a regular lane. Oftentimes cyclists pull out further into the intersection, and may not be required to obey red lights. Keep this in mind as you check for them.
 Make sure the front of your car is not inching into traffic, but also make sure that you can see completely.


If you cannot see completely, do not make the turn.
 Watch everyone who is moving on their green light, including bicycles and motorcycles. This can include people on the right making a U-turn.


If it is a very big intersection, there may be people across from you that have a left turn arrow, so be sure to watch the whole road. , You should begin and end the turn in the lane nearest to the right side of the road.


Unless there is a sign indicating otherwise, always turn into the lane closest to you, the right lane.

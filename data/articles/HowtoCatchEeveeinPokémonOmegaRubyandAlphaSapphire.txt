 You can get it after you have finished the Elite Four, and you need to go to Littleroot Town and talk to Professor Birch. He will upgrade your Pokedex.;
, Here you will find Eevee and other Pok√©mon such as Nincada and the common Zigzagoon. But the only way to find it is to use the Dexnav. The Dexnav will sense a silhouette and a cry that will sound like Eevee. So approach it by creeping over to it, and then you can encounter it.
 Once you catch it, you can turn it into any Eeveelution!

, Now that you've caught Eevee, you can just search for it anytime and it will just appear. By just pressing the Eevee sprite on the Dexnav and clicking Search, you will have many Eevees in no time.

 Remove any oven racks, thermometers, or other removable elements from your cooled oven. Then apply baking soda to all stained surfaces of your oven’s interior, paying particular attention to thick or greasy stain areas.


Make sure that if you have used your oven recently, it is turned off and completely cooled before cleaning it with baking soda.
Apply the baking soda liberally, up to ¼ inch thick in areas that are stained.For the sides and top surfaces of the oven where you can’t easily sprinkle on baking soda, add enough water to the baking soda to make a paste that can be spread on to the oven surface.;
, Lightly pour or spray water from a spray bottle onto the baking soda-covered surfaces of your oven. Use enough water to fully saturate the baking soda.A spray of water should be enough for a light layer of baking soda, while pouring on water may be needed for a thicker coating. The goal is for a paste-like consistency, with no dry powder but no pooled water either.
You may also spritz plain white vinegar over the baking soda with a spray bottle. Take care if using this method, as the combination of vinegar and baking soda creates a chemical reaction that can be explosive in large quantities. Use only a spray bottle for vinegar in this case., Allow the dampened baking soda coating to sit undisturbed in your oven. Wait for at least 12 hours or overnight before removing it.


You can spritz the baking soda with water again if you find it has become dry, but otherwise you can leave the mixture alone until the next day.
You’ll find that the damp baking soda turns black or brown as it picks up the grease and stains from your oven. If you used a vinegar spray, the mixture will bubble. These signs are normal and show the effect of the baking soda in picking up food stains.

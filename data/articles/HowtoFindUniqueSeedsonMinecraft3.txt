 One of the most famous, best-reviewed seeds for the PS3 is, oddly enough, named after the popular alt-rock group. This world has it all: multiple biomes, several temples, various scattered villages, mineral wealth, and even a few libraries. With this and so much more to find, this seed makes a great all-around choice for any game mode., This seed spawns you next to a set of standard villages. The catch? They are right next door to two fungal biomes, giving you a chance to see giant mushrooms and more up-close.



Tip: One of the villages has a diamond in it â€” a rarity in the early game.
 This huge world contains an impressive desert and much more: numerous villages (some with blacksmiths and diamonds), a few surface dungeons and desert temples, and even a set of mob spawners. If you're willing to explore, you can find other biomes as well.

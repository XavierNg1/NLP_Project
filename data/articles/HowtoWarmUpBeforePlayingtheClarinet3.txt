 These are like long tones except that at the peak of volume you add the register key. For example, on low E you would go to middle line B.
 These are challenging at first, so don't give up on them. Start on the E with the register key and then lift your top finger. If you are new to the altissimo register this is actually a half step higher than C with only the back hole down and the register key. Keep doing this until you get to A with the register key down. For the notes to respond, you need a fast air stream and pressure.
 Play the chromatic scale slowly.
Start on first line e, and go to the lowest note (very low E).
After you get to the lowest E, put the register key down. Then stop for 1 2 beats, then play the second lowest note, (very low F) and put the register key down.
Keep doing this until you get to the first line E again.
Start on low G, and put the register key down. Then slide your left pointer (first key finger, of the finger that plays A) down just a little, so that you are just halfway covering the hole. do this little, and only do it if you are experienced.

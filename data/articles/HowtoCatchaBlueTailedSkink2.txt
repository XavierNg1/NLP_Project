 Do this if you have not had success with your hands, or do not wish to touch the skink. Using a net can be easier than your hands, since you have more reach on the skink and do not have to worry about it shedding its tail.


If you have trouble luring the skink out of its hiding place, then it will be difficult to use a net. Try using a trap instead.
 Any unscented, sturdy container will be fine for a temporary home. You can add local leaves and grasses along with food and water. Blue-tailed skinks will eat spiders and other insects, but the easiest food to acquire is from crickets.


Although it is not recommended, you should do research on the most suitable home for this skink if you are preparing a permanent home. It may help to talk to employees at a local vivarium, which can be found online on in the yellow pages.
If you plan to keep the skink permanently, check the laws and permits for your area first.
 The best nets are butterfly nets, which have a long handle and wide net on the end.


A long handle will allow you to reach the skink from farther away, increasing your chances of catching the skink.
A wide net will also make it easier to catch the skink because you do not have to be so exact when enclosing it.
 Place a bowl of food and light near the area where the skink is hiding, in order to draw the skink out into the open.
 While the skink is busy eating, bring the net down and around it to trap it underneath. It is best to approach the skink from behind so that it is less likely to see you.
 Slide the cardboard under the net to trap the skink inside the net. This will prevent the skink from escaping when you turn the net over.
 While holding the cardboard over the opening of the net, turn the net over so that you can carry the skink. Keep the cardboard over the end so it does not jump or crawl out.
 Remove the cardboard and turn the net over to allow the skink to fall or crawl into its new home.

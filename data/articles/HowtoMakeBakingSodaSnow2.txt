 Half the fun of baking soda snow is getting your hands “dirty.” If this is a group activity for kids, let each make their own batch. Give the kids the thrill of making a mess with ingredients that are actually cleaners.At the same time, keep a close eye on young children who have a habit of putting things in their mouths. Instruct all young children not to consume it.
 With each jar, rub a glue stick (or regular old glue from a bottle) over the inside of the jar’s lid. Press the bottom of whatever elements you’re adding (like a Santa, sleigh, or evergreen figurine) into the glue until it’s firmly in place. Then dust the rest of the lid with your fake snow and screw the jar on upside-down., Be sure to add enough liquid ingredient to your batch so that your snow is easily molded without crumbling. Then simply ball some up to form a snowman as you would with real snow. Or, break out the sand toys from your last beach trip to make snow castles instead of sand castles., Make enough snow to cover a wide area like a tabletop. Then invite the kids to break out their favorite action figures and dolls for a wintry blast. Let the Barbies go skiing, reenact the Battle of Hoth with Star Wars figures, or do whatever else their imagination comes up with., Adding vinegar to baking soda causes a perfectly safe chemical reaction that makes the baking soda erupt into fizz, much like the Mentos-and-soda trick. Amuse the kids by giving them a bowl of vinegar to drop their snowballs into. For some twisted Bond-villain fun, make snowmen, inject them with a dropper filled with vinegar, and cackle evilly as they melt from the inside out.

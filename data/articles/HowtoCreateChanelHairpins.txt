 To make a clean cut, lay the wire on the table and make sure it’s completely flat. Measure 5 inches (12.7 cm) and then snip.;
,, You may want to make sure the glue has dried (at least somewhat) before pushing it through the pearl hole (so that it doesn’t catch on the sides of the hole).


Allow the glue to dry completely before proceeding to the next step.
 The end of the wire should still be inside the pearl.
 Wind one of the separated wire pieces around the outside of one side of the hairpin. You must still be able to open the hairpin, so make sure you are only wrapping one side. Winding should only go approximately a quarter of the way down the pin.


Repeat the process but on the other side of the hairpin. You should have two wires still hanging off each side.
 Only a small dab of glue will do the trick, as a glob may interfere with your hairstyle.

You can dry the corn husks off purchased corn. Alternatively, buy husks from an ethnic grocery store or farmer's markets (especially Hispanic ones). Some regular supermarkets might also stock them. During sweet corn season, many grocery stores allow customers to husk their corn in the store, and are more than happy to allow you to bring away some husks for free..but just ask the produce manager nicely first!;
, This will make them much more pliable and easier to work with.
 This tends to be a wet and messy project.
 If you have one or two that have holes or brown spots on them, put them on the outside.
 You could also use thick, strong rubber bands if you want.
, Take two small pieces of soaked husk. Wad each piece into a ball, and stuff it in between a larger husk to cover it like a ball. Tie some string under the ball. Attach to the body with the rubber band or string.
 Tie on both ends to stop the braid from unraveling. Slip each arm in between the husks and tie into place.

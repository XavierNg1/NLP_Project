, Once you have logged in, you will be directed to your News Feed. To the right of the News Feed is a list of your friends. Those available for chat will have a green dot beside their name. Click on a friend you want to chat with to open a small chat box at the bottom of the screen.


You can also click the status text field at the top of the page to begin creating a status post.
 There are two Alt keys on your keyboard; you can press any one of them.
 Do this in sequence, and make sure you use the numeric keypad on the right side of the keyboard, not the numbers at the top.


Make sure that Num Lock is ON; otherwise, this will not work. Num Lock is a key on the top left corner of the numeric keypad, just above 7.
 After entering the code and releasing the Alt key, you’ll have created the † symbol.
 Finish writing your message or status, and when you’re done, just press Enter on the keyboard (for chat messages) or click “Post” to post your new status update.

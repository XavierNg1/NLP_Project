Slice a watermelon in half. One half is going to be used to infuse the vodka, the other half can be used for something else, or normal snacking. Slice the half of watermelon in half, creating two quarters, and then slice the quarter pieces of watermelon, separating between the flesh and the rind. Continue to cut the watermelon into about 1 inch chunks.

Don’t worry about removing the seeds, they will be strained out later.


Place the cut up watermelon chunks into an airtight jar. Fill the jar with vodka, and completely cover the cubes. Seal the container and place it in a cool, dark place to steep for at least 6 days.,

Remove the container from its storage place, and open the jar. Place a clean tea towel, or cheesecloth over the mouth of the jar, and secure it with a rubber band. Slowly tip the jar over, and strain the infused vodka into clean bottles or jars.

The vodka should look pink.
Throw out the watermelon chunks, or if you’re feeling really daring, wrap the pieces of watermelon in plastic wrap, refrigerate, and eat later.

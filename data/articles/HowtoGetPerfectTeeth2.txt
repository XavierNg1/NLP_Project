 You should floss your teeth at least once daily, in conjunction with your regular brushing. Flossing is a great way to remove tartar and plaque that brushing sometimes can't., You will need the right length of floss in order to properly floss your teeth. An appropriate length of floss is one that reaches from your hand to your shoulder. Once you have this length of floss, wrap the ends around your middle fingers.The floss should reach between your hands, having been wrapped around your middle fingers.
 Once you have the floss wrapped around your middle fingers, you can start working it between your teeth. Follow these detailed steps to get the most out of your flossing:Slide the floss between your teeth.
Bend the floss into a “c” shape.
Bring the floss completely up and down the tooth to clean out any plaque or tartar.
Bend the “c” shape the other way and once again move the floss completely up and down the tooth.
Continue in this way until you have flossed between every tooth.
 After you floss your teeth you will want to brush them and then finish with a mouthwash. This can help remove any leftover particles of plaque or tartar that were broken loose during flossing.Swish mouth wash for around thirty seconds before spitting it out.You can dilute mouthwash with water if it is too strong.
Brush properly, reaching all your teeth, and taking at least two minutes.

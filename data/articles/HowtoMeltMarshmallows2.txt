 You will need the skillet to be very hot before you can add the marshmallows, so leave the skillet in the oven while it is heating. This method will allow you to make a s'mores dip.


If you do not have a cast-iron skillet, you can use another, similar-sized oven-safe dish instead.
 Set the marshmallows down on their (curved) sides, and cut them in half using a sharp knife. You should end up with a disk-shaped marshmallow. Set these aside.
 Make sure that you use a pot holder, because the skillet will be very hot. Do not turn the oven off.
 You can simply hold the skillet by the handle and twist and turn it until the butter coats the entire surface. If you are not using a skillet, then you can spread the butter around on the surface using a heat-safe spatula instead.
 If you wish to make a s'more dip, you will need to add some chocolate. Measure out 1 Â½ cups (265 grams) of chocolate chips and spread them out evenly on the bottom of the skillet.
 Arrange them so that they are touching each other. They should fit snugly inside the skillet. Be careful not to burn your fingers on the skillet!

, Let the marshmallows bake for 5 to 7 minutes. The tops will turn golden-brown and crispy, but the insides will be soft and gooey.


If you want a crispy, fire-like texture, turn the broiler on during the last few minutes. Watch them carefully to avoid burning them.
 Set it down on a heat-safe surface and let the dip cool for at about 5 minutes.
 You can spread the marshmallows onto graham crackers, cake, or cupcakes using a butter knife. You can also break graham crackers in half or into quarters, and dip them into the melted marshmallows.

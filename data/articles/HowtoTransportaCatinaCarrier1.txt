 Do not use cleaning products to clean the carrier, since the scent of these products is off-putting for cats. Instead, use mild soap and hot water to clean the carrier. Take the carrier apart and clean it with a scrub brush. Then rinse it with water and leave it outside to dry in the sun.Cleaning the carrier will give it a neutral scent and may help it smell less like the vet’s office.;
, Leave the carrier’s door open so your cat can explore the carrier as it pleases. It is best to do this at least a week in advance so your cat has enough time to become comfortable with the carrier.For example, place the carrier near one of your cat’s sunning spots, like the window sill, or near your cat’s bed or favorite napping spot.
 This will help entice your cat to explore the carrier on its own. You can also place a piece of your cat’s bedding, like a blanket, in the carrier. If you don’t have a piece of bedding, put a piece of clothing that belongs to the cat’s favorite person in the carrier.Alternatively, rub a towel or cloth behind your cat’s ears and around its neck and face to pick up its scent. Place this inside the carrier.
The goal is to make the carrier comfortable enough for your cat to eat or sleep in.
 Once your cat starts going into the carrier on its own, start closing the door for a few seconds at a time. Once it is comfortable with the door being closed, begin driving short distances with your cat in the car.For example, begin by backing out and pulling up the driveway. When your cat is comfortable with this, then drive it around the block. This way, your cat may come to understand that the carrier and the car do not always mean a trip to the vet.

 Cats can make as many as 16 different meows. Paying attention to the different sounds can help you better communicate with your cat.


A short meow is typically a greeting.
Multiple meows signal excitement
A mid-pitch meow is a request, likely for food.
A deep “Mrow” is usually a complaint.
A high pitch “Rroww!” is an indication of anger or pain.
A long drawn out “mrrroww” is usually a demand.;
, In nature, cats only meow as kittens to get attention for their mothers. When they realize you do not respond to their other signals, they learn to meow. Often the meow is a way to communicate something the cat wants, but it can have other meanings as well.


Most frequently your cat’s meow is trying to articulate a request. A meow often means that it wants food, attention, or to be allowed into a room.
A meow can also signal distress. Cats vocalize when they are in heat, lonely, stressed, angry, or in pain. They also become more vocal when they get older.
Other times a meow is a simple greeting similar to a “hello.”, Some of the most important ways that cats communicate are through body language. Cats, for example, have a complex language of signals that they make with their tails.


When a cat looks you in the eyes and makes a long, slow blink, they are showing affection. This is sometimes compared to a kiss.
A cat approaching you with its tail in the air is a greeting that suggests your cat is happy to see you. This has been compared to a handshake.If the fur on your cats hair is standing up, this is a sign that it is angry or afraid.
When your cat's tail is low, or between its legs, it is insecure or anxious.
A tail thrashing back and forth is a sign that your cat is angry. The faster it moves it back and forth, the angrier it is.

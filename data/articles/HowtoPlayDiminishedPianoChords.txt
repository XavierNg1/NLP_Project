 (Root, whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step.) For purposes of this example, let's use the “C” scale, which is: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.;
, So the notes in a C diminished chord are: C, Eb, & Gb. (It is like a C minor, {C, Eb, & G} with the fifth, G, also flatted.) A C diminished chord would typically be denoted either: C dim, C Dim and occasionally as C-.
 (C dim = C, Eb, Gb) Then the doubly flatted seventh is added; Bbb. Yes a double flatted seventh is the same note as the sixth, so a Bbb is also an A. —However, since the chord is called a diminished seventh, the seventh tone of the scale must be present and “A” is the sixth tone of the “C” scale, not the seventh. To be any type of seventh chord, the seventh tone of the scale must be present in some form. Therefore, to be theoretically correct, the note must be called a “B” double flat, —not an “A”. So, the notes in a C dim7 chord are: C, Eb, Gb, & Bbb.
 (Up a minor third from C is Eb, up another minor third is Gb and up another minor third is Bbb (which is also A) So, C dim7 is one chord, C# dim7 or Db dim 7 is the second chord, and D dim7 is the third chord, - - - and when you reach Eb dim7 / D# dim7, you will be playing the same note that are in a C dim7. (Eb, Gb, Bbb {also known as A} and Dbb {also known as C})

, Since only twelve notes and their octaves exist and since 12 ÷ 4 = 3, there are only three diminished chords possible before you are playing a different inversion of the same chord again.

 You will see that even as you start to type your search word(s), Mail begins to make suggestions. In this example, the search is for an email from a friend named "Colin" containing some password details.

In this example, you can see that the search token is set to find messages "From" the "Colin" chosen from the original list. By using the drop-down menu, you could also select:

"To" - to search for messages sent "to" the person selected from the list.
"Entire Message" - to list all messages containing the word selected (in this case, "Colin."

 As before, you can change the terms of the search token using the drop down menu.

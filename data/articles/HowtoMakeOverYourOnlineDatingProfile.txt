 Ok, so you have an online dating site profile, or maybe you have several on different sites. You have some witty things in there about yourself and you put a couple of pictures you found from a couple years ago that look decent. Now, you’re sitting there and you're wondering why the responses aren’t coming in like you expected.;
, I am going to give you some helpful tips that will help your dating profile get the responses you want, and also help you feel better about yourself.
 What you want to do here is simple; get several pictures taken of yourself that will be recent and nice. You do not want to use pictures that are too revealing or too sexy. This will give the wrong impression.
 Do not use webcam pictures or video pictures that are grainy.


Do not take the picture yourself out of focus or from some crazy angle.
Do not use glamour shots, or old outdated photo’s because if you meet someone, they will eventually see the REAL you.
 Get a manicure and pedicure. Get a hair cut and for the men, shave your face and women get a facial. Now, for the best part, go shopping and get yourself something that you feel good about wearing. Treat yourself to a really nice day out doing all this.
 You can get yourself a disposable camera and take it to any drugstore or Walmart and get them developed and ask for a digital disk also. Now you have pictures you can add to your profile.
 Make sure you have someone take this picture with a lot of light so there is no need for a flash. Make sure to smile! Next take several pictures of yourself with a full standing view. Do not make the background to busy to distract people from seeing the real you.
 Do not be misleading and most importantly, do not give to much personal information. And finally, be courteous and answer all responses to your online dating profile quickly and politely. If you are not interested in someone who responds to your online dating profile, let them down politely.

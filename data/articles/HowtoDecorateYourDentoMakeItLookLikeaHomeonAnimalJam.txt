 It doesn't really matter which one, as long as you like it. You may want one that has enough space for a kitchen, dining room, living room, bathroom, playroom (if you have kids), 2-4 bedrooms, and a yard.;
, Buy a fridge and a stove. Put a few rectangular tables  between the kitchen appliances. That makes your counter space. Put a sink (if possible you can buy one at Kimbara) somewhere between the refrigerator and counter, or the stove and counter. Put a rug in front of your sink if you wish. You can add a breakfast nook by buying a tea party table and adding a few mats around it.
 Place a table in the middle of the space you want to use. You can add some chairs, depending on how many people are in the family, around the table.
 Put a television hanging above a fireplace to be really predictable and conventional. Add some long couches next to the TV. You can place a rug between the two couches.
 You can get a great look easily by putting a sink, a rug, and a chair wooden ones if possible, in a suitable area. Place the den items in which ever order you want.
 If not, skip this step. Put a lot of plushies, try including giant ones, in a large room, but no bigger then the living room. Add a few tables and beach balls, beach towels, computers, and even tablets in the room. Add 3 non-member couches and put some pillows on them. There's your play room. 

, You can put some pink sofas, or non-member couches, around the place. You can add plushies, a TV, a fireplace, a laptop, a tablet... These items can make different rooms, depending on your personality.
 Just put beach towels, trees, plants, flowers if you can, toys, deck chairs or lawn chairs, and different den items that are built for the outdoors.
 You can make a great office by putting in a desk ( Greeley's desks are good ) with a lamp and a rug and a door. Add some chairs for you to sit on and some for others if you invite anyone else to you office.

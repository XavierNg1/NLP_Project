 The photos could be themed, such as a family holiday or a child growing up through the ages, or simply random photos you like. You will want two large pictures––one on each side of the brick (or four if you're creating two bricks) and then two or three smaller pictures for each side of the brick. Determine if you want to cover the top of the brick––if so, find another picture. Use a ruler to take measurements so you know how big to print your pictures.
 If your pictures are cataloged on your computer, print out enough pictures to cover both sides of each brick (two larger pictures), the two sides and top (several smaller pictures). Use camera-ready photo paper for the highest quality. Alternatively, have a photo store print the images for you.
 You will have a framed photo on each side of the brick and then you'll decoupage the rest of the pictures onto the brick itself. Consider using frames that do not have stands and flat back surfaces so they can be easily affixed to the brick.
 Use either liquid nails or silicone adhesive to make each frame stick. Hold in place for several minutes while it adheres and bonds to the brick.
 You may just like the look of the two pictures frames and stop there. However, if you want to add more family memories, brush one layer of decoupage on a cleaned brick surface and then affix your photos. Wait about 20 minutes for the solution to dry and then add another layer. Perform this step three or four times and then spray with acrylic sealer to complete the project.

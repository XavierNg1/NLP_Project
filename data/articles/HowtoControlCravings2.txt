 You cannot gain control over something that you do not truly believe exists. Whether you have a small problem controlling minor cravings or have a large scale addiction, recognizing the problem is the first step to gain control. Some signs that your cravings may actually be a problem are:You feel guilty after indulging your craving.
Your mood and self esteem are affected by your cravings.
Attempting to stop what you are craving causes anxiety, irritability, or physical withdrawal.
If your cravings interfere with work or family life you may be dealing with an addiction.
 Before creating a concrete plan to control your cravings you must commit to changing your lifestyle. If you are not committed, you will not follow through with your plan. You may have to make some serious changes in your life, such as dealing with stress in a different way or re-evaluating your social situations.Think about how you will avoid your cravings. For example, if you crave donuts, plan how you will handle days when someone brings donuts for everyone. If you and your friends normally meet at the ice cream shop, suggest meeting them at a fitness class instead.
 Once you have developed a plan to conquer your cravings, stick to it. If you find yourself slipping, remind yourself of your goals.Remember that conquering your cravings is not an all or none situation. You can still enjoy your favorite foods in moderation. For example, you may want to avoid eating ice cream every night, but you can still enjoy a scoop with your friends on the weekend.
If you indulge more than you'd planned, know that it's normal to over do it sometimes. Instead of beating yourself up about it, return to your plan and remind yourself of times you've been successful.

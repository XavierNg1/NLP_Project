 Before you begin massaging your hands and fingers, be sure to take off any rings or bracelets that may get in the way.;
, For a smooth massage, it is best to first apply lotion or oil to your hand before, and during the massage, to keep your skin slick. This will allow your thumb and fingers to more easily slide across your skin so it won't become irritated by too much friction.However, some people would recommend not putting lotion on straight away, because some 'drag' is important for releasing fascia.
 Shake them out and wiggle your fingers about. Stretch your hands by flexing them as wide as you can, and then make a fist. Bend your wrists with your hands points down, and then flex your hand up and down several times. Continue to use these techniques for about one minute before you begin to massage your hands.
 The pressure applied to your fingers should be firm, but not painful. A few seconds for each fingertip will do. After pinching the tops and bottoms of your finger and thumb tips, go back to each tip and pinch them again, this time squeezing from side to side.

 Explain that you do not appreciate that they have taken your money. Talk to them about how hard you work and how the money is rightfully yours., The safest place to hide your money is in a bank! If it is just your siblings that are taking your money, ask your parents if they can help you sign up for an account at the bank. If you are under 18 years old and in the US, you have to sign up with a parent. Your parent or guardian will also have access to your account., If you have made a lot of money and want to invest it for the future, talk to your parents or guardian about putting your money into savings bonds. This will help double your money over many years (such as 5, 10, 20, 25) but make it so no one but you are able to cash it out at the bank.

 Most parents work during the day and will leave you home alone or with someone not as strict about your internet access. That's the perfect time to go crazy on your social media sites. The best time for this will be summer vacation or right after school

, If your parents don't go to work or work at night, try staying up all night alone using it. Here is an article about staying up at night. Make sure they don't see the light on your device, and don't stay up too late.
 This works if you have your own phone. Try using it when they're busy or just not noticing you.
 Open another page or window with something you're allowed to do. If your parents come and ask you what are you doing, quickly switch the screen to the other page so they won't know that you're using social media.
 If your school allows you to bring your own phone, and you have internet yourself, use it on the way to school or back home (if your parents aren't there). Also, if your school allows you to use your phone every break, use it as long as possible. Keep in mind that most schools block you from accessing social media websites.

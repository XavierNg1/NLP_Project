 These yard markers show how far you are throwing,(1 yard = 3 feet).;
, If you do not stretch before throwing, you run the risk of injuring your arm.
 IE: shoulders facing your target, arms separating forming a T, and finally driving your glove and non-throwing shoulder to your target. Increase the distance as you go. Be sure to take your time while warming up. Also while throwing make sure you are trying to throw the ball through the person you are throwing with.
 This helps you get a good idea of your release point while throwing.
 Don't try to start out throwing 60 yards (54.9Â m) on the first day. Work up to further distances as your arm strength improves. This might take a few rounds of long toss but the end results are definitely worth it!

, This process helps your arm "cool down" so to speak. After you're done make sure to stretch your arm and ice it for about 20-30 minutes to help it heal.

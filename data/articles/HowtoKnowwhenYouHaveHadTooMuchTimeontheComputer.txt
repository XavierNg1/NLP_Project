 Even though you're having fun, you need to set yourself boundaries, your health can be at serious risk if you play too much! So, set yourself some boundaries, like play on the computer for a couple of hours then have a break.;
, In your break, you can get something to eat and drink, and sit down and relax for a bit, maybe go outside and take a walk a bit.


Your break needs to range from a half an hour to an hour, don't have a short break and go back on it.

 When you feel like the conversation has reached its end or one of you has to go, say something like, “It’s been so nice talking to you” or “I’m so glad that we got back in touch.” This will show them how much you’ve enjoyed talking to them., After talking, you may decide that you want to meet up with this person. If you feel like meeting in person, say something like, “We should get together sometime.” You can take it a step further if you want and ask them to do something specific, like getting lunch or coffee., If you don’t feel like meeting up with this person or you are living in different places, but you still want to talk every now and then, say something like, “Let’s try to keep in touch.” You could also be more specific by saying, “I’ll give you a call next week,” or “I’ll give you a call after my trip to Puerto Rico and tell you how it went!”., After you have finished telling them how much you’ve enjoyed getting back in touch, it’s time to say goodbye. Since you’ve already set up your goodbye, you can say something simple. Even saying something like, “Alright, well we’ll talk soon. Take care,” is a good farewell.

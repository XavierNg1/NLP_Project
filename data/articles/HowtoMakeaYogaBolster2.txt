 The filling, whether you choose to use old blankets or towels, will need to be rolled up lengthwise. Lay the filling out flat and roll it up tightly, like a yoga mat.Consider using rubber bands or string to bind the rolled-up filling. This will make it easier to stuff the filling inside your pillow case or cloth, and will also help keep the bolster tight during use.
Once the filling is rolled, you'll need to insert it into the sheath. If you're using a pillow case, this should be fairly easy. All you'll need to do is slide the filling inside the pillow case, while retaining the tight wrap of the filling., If the bolster is too small, you can add additional filling (towels or blankets) to create a longer or thicker bolster. If it's too large, you can scale back on your filling. Ultimately, though, the size of the finished product should be determined by your body and your needs.


A common size for cylindrical bolsters is 24 inches long by eight inches high. Some yoga practitioners find this height ideal for well-supported forward bends and a deep chest opening.Some yoga practitioners prefer a smaller bolster for supporting the neck, knees, and spine. If you want a smaller bolster, try aiming for 16 inches long and five to six inches high., If you used a pillow case, securing the open end will be easy. Simply use a rubber band or piece of string to tightly tie the open end shut.This will give you a functional bolster that can still be taken apart as needed.

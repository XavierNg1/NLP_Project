 The use of topical creams can aid greatly in the healing process. Available over-the-counter from your local pharmacy or drugstore. Examples of Creams include:


Corticosteroid creams with low doses of steroids that help reduce pain and swelling.Creams with lidocaine to help reduce pain. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic., You can do this while sitting on the toilet for some added relief. The warmth of the teabag is soothing in itself and the tannin found in tea is a natural astringent which will help to reduce swelling and pain.

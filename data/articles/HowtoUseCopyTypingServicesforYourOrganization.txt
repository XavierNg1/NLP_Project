 Business people in areas such as auctioneering, agricultural, medical, educational, individuals' business firms or retail & big accountancy, etc., can benefit from having someone else do the polishing work after you've done the hard thinking. The sorts of things that you can expect help with include:


Conference and interview transcription
Detailed reports in multiple document format
Book manuscripts - digital and copy typing
Property and building inventories
Building survey reports
Medico legal reports
Foreign Language Translation;
, This will vary dependent on whether you need to present a document or whether you're wanting to email it around or load it onto the Internet. Always give the precise specifications for what you're after, and consider asking for an electronic copy even if you are wanting hard copy outcomes (it's an important back-up and storage method).

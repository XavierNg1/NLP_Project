 To keep in freshness, it is best to have a tight wrapping around the fish, rather than placing it into a large container. Wrapping will help seal in moisture and flavor, while placing in a larger tin or container may cause the fish to dry out., Although a freezer is too cold for fresh fish, a refrigerator is often too warm an environment. The solution is to place your fish on ice (directly, or still wrapped) inside of the fridge. As the ice melts, you’ll need to drain it, so keep this in mind when choosing a storage method.When you purchase fresh fish, it should be in a similar configuration: over ice, in a sealed container. If your fresh fish is not stored properly prior to purchasing it, skip it.
Sort through shellfish, and throw away any with cracked or broken shells, as they may have been contaminated.
 Once your fish has been wrapped (if flesh is exposed) and properly covered in ice, seal the container you’ve placed them in. This will help maintain freshness and discourage bacterial growth., Because your fish should not be placed into water, make sure you remove any melted ice during the storage period. You can place the ice in a colander, then place the colander into a bowl, or you can place your ice into a plastic bag for easy clean-up., Fresh fish can spoil quickly and easily, so use whatever fresh fish you have within 2 days of catching or purchase. If you cannot get to it within that time frame, cook it and store the cooked fish, which will last a bit longer, and will not run as high a risk of spoiling.If you cannot get to your fresh fish within two days, follow the freezing recommendations to salvage the fish you’ve not gotten to.

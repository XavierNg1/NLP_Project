 To beat level 135, you must create and detonate at least five color bombs. Color bombs can be created by matching five candies of the same color in a row, and will wipe out all candies on the board of the same color you match them with.;
, Making matches at the bottom of the playing board will improve your odds for the formation of special candies as a result of the cascading effect, which is when candies fall down to replace those you matched. In many cases, cascading candies in level 135 can result in the automatic creation of color bombs., After chocolate squares start spreading out from the corners to the rest of the playing board, they may interfere with your ability to create multiple color bombs.Match color bombs with candies of the same color positioned next to the chocolate squares. This can help wipe out chocolate, while allowing you to collect a color bomb at the same time.
Allow any horizontal striped candies you create to fall into the bottom row of the board, if possible. Detonating horizontal striped candies in the bottom row can help wipe out the chocolate squares positioned at the bottom left and right corners of the playing board., While you may be tempted to create these types of special candies, these matches can affect your opportunity to make multiple color bombs.
 The detonation of color bombs will result in there being fewer colors remaining on the board, which can help you create more color bombs.

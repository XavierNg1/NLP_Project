 If you are unable or unwilling to provide appropriate housing and husbandry, then perhaps this species is not for you.
, Vinegaroons have heavy mouthparts (pedipalps) that are formed into pincers. The first pair of legs is long and thin and is used like antenna to feel their way around. Vinegaroons have poor eyesight. The next three pairs of legs are used for walking. The abdomen is attached widely to the head-thorax region (cephalothorax). The tail is long and thin suggesting a whip which is where the common name, "whipscorpion," originates. Their chelicerae are too small to really get a hold of skin and bite with much vigor. But they will pinch pretty firmly, if they feel the need., Eggs are carried in a sac by the female. After hatching, they ride on the femaleâ€™s back similar to scorpions., Sexing Vinegaroons is very difficult as it is done by a very close inspection of the cephalothorax (underbelly) and differentiating a slightly different shaped segment., Vinegaroons have no venom glands, but they have glands near the rear of their cephalothorax that can spray a combination of 85% acetic acid and octanoic acid when they are threatened. The acetic acid gives this spray a vinegar-like smell, giving reasoning to the common name Vinegaroon. Unless you happen to be allergic to vinegar, then you have no reason to be alarmed, if you're ever sprayed., Typically, these critters are very tolerant of handling. Be very careful when doing so as they are not as strong as they look. A fall of even a meter can kill or severely injure them.

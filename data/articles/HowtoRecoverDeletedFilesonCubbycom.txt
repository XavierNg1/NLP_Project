 Open a new web browser and go to the Cubby home page.;
, Click the “Log In” button located on the top right corner of the homepage. You will be brought to the login page. Enter your email address and password for Cubby, then click on the “Log in” button below it.


Once logged in, you will be brought to your main folder with all your cubbies.
 You can open a folder by clicking on it. You need to be in the same location (cubby or folder) as the deleted files so that you can immediately see them once they’re unhidden.
 Click the “More” button from the header menu, and select “Show deleted.” All the deleted files on your Cubby account, particularly that cubby or folder location you’re in, will be unhidden., You can see all the deleted files in grayscale. They still work just like any other files on Cubby. You can still view and download them or check their file versions. They just appear differently compared to the other files.
 Hover over the file you want to recover. A menu button will appear on the far right. Click on it.
 From the menu that will appear, click “Restore.” The file will be brought back to its normal color. You have now recovered a previously deleted file on Cubby.com.

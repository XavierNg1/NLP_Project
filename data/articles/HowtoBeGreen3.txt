 If your car is old, consider buying a new car that is better for the environment. Some good choices are:


Electric cars.They don't release emissions and are becoming popular throughout the market. They can cost a lot, but after that you don't have to pay for gas.
Hybrids.They do consume gas, but release less emissions. You can find them just about anywhere. Plus, they cost only $20,000 to $40,000.
Hydrogen cars. Like electric cars they do not release emissions. However, they are quite rare.
If none of these ring your bell, try hypermiling, carpooling or living without a car.
 If you decide to do something other than drive, consider the following choices:


Walking. Do this for short distances such as walking to the nearby shops or taking your kids to school. Walking also works well for people who are strapped for cash. Although walking instead of driving is quite slow, it's worth the effort and walking is actually really good for your body!
Biking. A good bike normally costs between $50 and $100 and folding bikes are portable and small enough to fit in your storage area. Just like walking, biking is very good for your body!
Catching the bus. The fares are dirt cheap and eco-friendly buses are the way to go. But be aware of traffic jams, they can ruin your day and you may have to wait on a cramped bus filled with noisy people!

 Have them answer the following questions:

Is it too heavy for them to lift, move or carry?
Is it an awkward shape?
Is it too big?;
, This should be done as follows:

Position your body as close as possible to the object.
Place your feet shoulder width apart.
 Tell them to:

Keep their back straight.
Get a good grip.
Keep the object close to your body.
 This includes telling them:

Don't twist.
Use your feet to turn your body.
Turn your feet towards the direction you want to carry the object in.
 Tell them to:

Push with the legs.
Lift straight up.
Set it down the same way you picked it up.
, Learning by doing is as important as teaching them the basics through discussion.

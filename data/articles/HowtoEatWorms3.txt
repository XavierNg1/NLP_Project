 Head out with a small shovel, and work in small, 6-inch holes. Dig in short, shallow strokes. Worms love loose soil, not hard packed earth. Some good places to look include:


Damp, dark places.
Under rocks or logs
Loose, wet soil.
After rain storms.
 Mustard powder is an irritant to a worm's skin, so it will drive them up to the air. Furthermore, worms can drown if stuck in the soil when it is wet (this is why you see so much more worms after rainstorms). Sprinkle some mustard powder on loose earth, then "water it" to slowly and evenly to pull worms up to the surface., Note, however, that worms are an essential part of the compost pile's life cycle. They are the ones actually doing the composting! That said, the food in a good compost pile is irresistible to a worm, and if you live in an area with worms they will get back in., Worms eat the soil, meaning they'll pick up chemicals and waste if it is nearby. Never forage for food in areas that might be covered in pesticides or worse.

Wear a sturdy pair of hiking boots. The boots should be waterproof.
Wear a thermal shirt and pants along with socks that are made from wool or synthetic materials as your base layer. Do not wear clothing made of cotton, as it dries slowly and will make it difficult to remain warm if it rains or snows.
Wear a layer of fleece clothing as the second layer.
Wear a waterproof and windproof outer layer. Ask an employee at a sporting goods store for such clothing if you are unsure of what will work.
Wear a winter hat and gloves.



Keep in mind that it often takes twice as long to walk or hike in winter as it does in warmer times, as snow or ice may be present.
Note that winter days are shorter than the days are in any other time of year. This will affect the amount of time you have for hiking and any activities you would like to do.
Check the weather forecast before you leave. Consider postponing your trip if there is severe weather in the forecast.

 If you have a large group, or a lot of time to play, organize a tournament. Draw straws to see who will play who, or let the group decide. Agree on rules before the tournament begins (e.g., decide if you will set a time limit and the person with the most points/assets at the end will win, or if you will play each game to completion before moving on).
 It’s easy to get competitive, but the goal is to enjoy yourselves. Remember to make fun the main factor, and don’t worry too much about winning or losing. Congratulate the winners of the game, and always accept congratulations graciously if you are the one to win.
 Pick up a few fun prizes, such as candy bars, bubbles, or Play-Doh for children. You could even get cheap scratch tickets or mini bottles of booze for an adult game night.


To stick with the theme, hand out dice, cards, or even a board game to the winners.

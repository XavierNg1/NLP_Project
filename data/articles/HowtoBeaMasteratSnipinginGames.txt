 Practice first on easy mode; if it's too easy, then normal. If that's also simple then try hard until you get to the highest level of difficulty.;
, You won't be able to concentrate in games like this if you don't have your full concentration. Also, stretch before playing to help with your reflexes.
 Try to aim for the head when using guns. This will later help with headshots in sniping. Once you can shoot in the head with a handgun or rifle, then you can pick up a sniper rifle.
 It just means shooting from a concealed area. So start off from small ranges. When at a small range in a concealed position, start off with shooting the chest, then neck, and finally the head. Once you can headshot from short range, you should try far concealed places. Follow the same procedure, chest, neck, and then head.
 Follow your target's movement, if the target is moving then you should position the crosshair a little to the left if they are running to the left (same goes with right). This is called 'leading' the target. The faster they are moving and the farther away they are, the more you need to lead them to hit them. Otherwise, adjust it to 'Lock On' effect.
 Some newer, more advanced games include realistic physics systems which include adding gravity to bullets. Therefore, if you find you just aren't hitting a target that's far away, try aiming up a few degrees.
 If they are concentrated on you, you should either move or have a sniper war. When in a sniper war you should shoot then duck so you can dodge the shot.
 Always pick a location that when you crouch your body is completely hidden. This is so that you can reload or hide from enemy fire if you miss and they see you.

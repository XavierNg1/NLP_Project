 Using your financial plan, determine your projected annual expenses and gross income. You'll need to have enough capital to cover both your start-up and operating expenses. If you do not, you will need to take out a loan.


Operating expenses include licenses, permits, insurance, rent or mortgage, a security system, employees' salaries, computer equipment and software, and professional services such as an accountant or bookkeeper.
You can lease equipment or purchase used equipment to save money on operating costs.
 This could be from your own savings, an investment partner, or a bank. Other entrepreneurs have used a line of credit with their bank, a home equity loan, a credit card or micro lending.
 You would then apply for the SBA loan at a local bank or credit union. This type of loan guarantees repayment by the SBA if you default., Find a bank who will give you a home equity loan or home equity line of credit. You would be using your own home as collateral. Make sure you can pay back this loan or you risk losing your home. You will also have to have a credit score in the high 600s to take out this type of loan., Internet micro lending services (also called peer to peer lending) help borrowers find lenders for relatively small loans, usually under $35,000. Research these sites and familiarize yourself with all of the rules and regulations in order to avoid misunderstandings later.Popular micro lending sites include Kiva, Prosper and Lending Club.

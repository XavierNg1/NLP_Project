 When your guest says "Can I check my Facebook?" you simply switch user (or log out) and give them the guest account to play with. You'll find it under Control Panel -> Users / Accounts -> Enable Guest Account on Windows (all versions of Windows are slightly different, so click around!);
, On Firefox, it's Preferences -> Privacy -> "Firefox will" -> "not remember". Check the "don't track" box, while you're there.
 If you prefer Firefox, install Chrome for your guests, and vice versa. When your mum wants to check her Gmail, simply start your spare browser and leave it to her! Leave the link to your guest browser prominently on the desktop or in the task bar in case your PC is hijacked when you're out of the room.

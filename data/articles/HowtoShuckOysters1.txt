 Oysters should still be alive when you shuck them; if they've already expired, they aren't safe to eat. Pick oysters with the following properties:


Closed shells. If an oyster's shell is open, it's likely that it's already dead. Lightly tap the shell, just in case; if it immediately shuts, the oyster is still alive and fine to eat.
A fresh sea smell. Fresh oysters smell both sweet and salty, like the air next to the sea. If an oyster smells fishy or "off," it's probably not fresh.
A heavy feel. Place the oyster in your palm. If has a nice heavy weight, that means it's still full of seawater and was probably harvested quite recently. If it's unexpectedly light, the seawater has dried up, and it's no longer fresh.;
, Besides a nice sack of fresh oysters, you'll need the following supplies:

A stiff-bristed brush
Heavy gloves






An oyster knife, or another knife with a heavy blade that won't snap
A bed of ice for keeping the oysters fresh until serving







, Before you start shucking, take a close look at an oyster so that you know the right way to handle it while shucking.

The hinge is the muscle that connects the top and bottom shells at the pointy end of the oyster.






Opposite from the hinge is the rounded front of the oyster.






The top of the oyster is the flatter shell.






The bottom shell is cup-shaped.

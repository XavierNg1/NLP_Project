 This is an easy one to level up if you know how to use it. Once you get Riku into you party, go to the room where the doors to the Org. members places are. There your gauge will be maxed out. So basically go Final Form outside that room and go through that room to get your gauge filled up. I would recommend using magic such as Firaga, Thundaga and Reflega against the Nobodies. It makes it very easy and quick to level up Final Form. Once it gets below 1 or 0, go back to that same room and your gauge will be filled and ready to go for another go. Repeat the process from there onward. Once you are done, you will have Final Form maxed out, have Glide maxed out and you will be at a decent level (such as in the 70s or 80s) even before you fight Xemnas for the first time! So you basically get 3 bonuses from doing this.

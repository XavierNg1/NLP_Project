 Comments exist solely to help developers navigate through their code. Remove all comments.


If needed, write all comments in a note document or on a sheet of paper so that you are the only one able to view your comments.;
, Never use constants. Numbers should be valued directly in code. This will make your code very hard to modify and follow.
 If you have to use a variable, no one will be able to figure out what the variable actually exists for without digging into the code if it has a very non-descriptive name. Try names such as single letters of the alphabet, or, if you are feeling particularly silly, completely unrelated nouns (such as "dog" or "cat").
 A good way to do this is to use methods where they are unnecessary. Try to use the most complex features that the language has to offer. For example, C offers a goto command which can be used to jump around code in a very confusing manner.
 Create classes, methods, and files that have nothing to do with the overall function of your code.
 Do not indent your code.

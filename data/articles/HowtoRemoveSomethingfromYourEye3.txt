 If your eye is irritated by anything larger than a small speck, you might need a doctor to help you remove it. Pain is the most obvious sign that something in your eye is more than a mild irritant, though sometimes something in your eye can cause serious damage even in the absence of pain. Other symptoms to watch for include visible changes to the color of the eye, bleeding, abnormal vision, or discharge from the eye.Alternately, if you simply cannot dislodge the foreign body from your eye, you should also consider this cause to see a medical professional.
 Once youâ€™ve identified something in your eye as a serious issue, contact a doctor. Larger foreign bodies must be removed by a doctor or medical professional. If the item is stuck inside of the eye, minor surgery may be required to remove it.Otherwise, the doctor may numb your eye and pull out the object, giving you an eye patch to protect it afterwards as it heals, and also possibly antibiotics., If you have a shard of glass or something else that has punctured your eye, avoid attempts to remove it yourself. You might do more damage in your attempt at removal. Instead, get to a doctor for medical aid.Carefully cover the eye with an eye patch until you see a doctor.

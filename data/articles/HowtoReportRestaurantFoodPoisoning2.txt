 If you get food poisoning, itâ€™s important for you to go see your doctor as soon as you can. Your doctor can determine if you do have food poisoning or another illness, if the food poisoning is mild or serious, and advise you on treatment.If you have an emergency, call 911 or visit the emergency room.
 Sometimes, food poisoning can take a few days to surface. Many people believe that food poisoning is due to the last meal they ate, but it may be from a meal eaten a day or two before. When reporting food poisoning, make sure to take into consideration everything you have eaten over the last couple of days.Think about the other people in your home, or other people who ate meals with you. See if they got sick too and if they have similar symptoms.
 Though you should definitely report anything suspicious, it is very difficult for food poison to be pinned on a specific restaurant. Mainly, this is because the contaminated food has more than likely been thrown away and there may not be a way to medically confirm food poisoning., Before you report food poisoning, you must be prepared to answer any questions the health department or agency will ask you. Gather the following information:Type of establishment where the food poison occurred, such as fast food restaurant, chain, bar, or bakery
Name of the establishment, along with the address and phone number.
Date of exposure
Time of exposure, as specific as possible, a.m. or p.m. at the least
Symptoms, including details, dates, times, and duration
Number of people in the party affected and not affected
Detailed list of foods consumed at the restaurant

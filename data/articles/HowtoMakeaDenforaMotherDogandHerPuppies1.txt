 You can either buy a whelping box or build one. You can find whelping boxes for sale at pet stores and online. Make sure to choose a whelping box that is big enough for your dog to stretch out and lie down in, but small enough that the puppies can’t get too far away from the mother.Make sure the walls are high enough to keep the puppies in and prevent drafts. There should be a door or lowered area that is at a height where the mother dog can step over it.
You should make sure the whelping box has rails along the sides to protect the puppies.
You can also build a whelping box. Make sure it still has all the features of one you would buy.;
, If you don’t want to build or buy a whelping box, you can create a den using boxes, crates, or even kiddie pools. You need an enclosed space that is big enough for the mother dog to stretch out in, but that is small enough to keep the puppies close to the mother and each other.You can use half of a crate without the top or a box with a small door area cut into it low enough for the mother to step over.
Make sure the edges are high enough so the puppies cannot get out, but low enough that the mother can step out of the box easily.
 Since your dog will want to keep the puppies protected and safe, you should build their den in a relatively private area in your home. This may be in a quiet unused room, a spare bathroom, or a garage.The room should be away from the normal foot traffic of your family or roommates.
The area for the den should be in a place where other pets cannot get to it.

 You will need a single-cup cone, matching filter (generally a Melitta #2), a grinder, a waste cup for spillover, and of course, a mug.
 For a single-cup cone, grind your coffee to medium-fine with a burr grinder., Place the cone onto the cup. Fold the filter at its seam, and place in the cone. Run hot water over the filter to rinse out any paper flavor and preheat cone and cup. Make sure you drain both completely before brewing the coffee!, Add about 3 tablespoons of ground coffee to the filter., Bring the water just to a boil, and pour only just enough into the filter to saturate the grounds. Move the stream of water around to saturate all the grounds evenly, but avoid pouring too muchâ€”you want very little water actually dripping through on the first pour. Let bloom for about 30 seconds., Pour water around the cone, breaking down the bloom and saturating all the grounds evenly. Fill the cone till the water's just about at the top of the cone, and let the water filter through the coffee, into the cup., When it's about full, quickly move the cone from your drinking cup to the waste cup so that it can finish dripping through.

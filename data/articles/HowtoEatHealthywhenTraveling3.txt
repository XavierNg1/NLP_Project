Preventing and treating headaches
Minimizing junk food cravings
Flushing your body of toxins
Preventing heat exhaustion

, Beer, wine, and liquor dehydrate you and contain many unneeded calories. Simply drinking in moderation instead of drinking excessively can make a big difference., Cutting down on calories at every meal is a healthier choice that also keeps your energy up. Eating big portions sends the message to your brain that less food will be eaten in the near future. Because of this, those extra calories get stored as fat., Leaner meats especially, such as seafood and chicken, are typically better for you than beef and pork.These foods provide you with lasting fullness, energy, and strength.


You can also get protein from foods that are not meat. Nuts, seeds, and beans are other good sources of protein.Choose a protein-rich dish without a lot of sugar and carbohydrates. Eating the proper amount of protein enhances concentration, and keeps you energetic, lean and strong. Sugar and carbohydrates can make you feel sluggish and contribute to weight gain when eaten too frequently., It’s usually a lot easier to stick to a healthy dietary intake when you give yourself a little break once in awhile. Let yourself have that cheeseburger or that hearty breakfast you’ve been craving, but only in careful moderation. Make sure that on the days you decide to indulge in a high-calorie meal or dessert that you make especially healthy food choices for the rest of the day.

 To do so, click on your account name on the upper-right part of the page. Select “Edit Profile” to access the Edit section of your account information.
 This will open all the reviews created by and for your account.
 This will display all the past reviews you’ve written as well as all the hosts or guests you’ve stayed with and waiting to be reviewed.
 To do so, select a user profile under the Reviews to Write section. Write your review on the text field provided. Hit Enter when you’re done to submit your review.


Keep in mind though that you need to have completed your stay first (from reservation to check-out) before you can write a review for it to be considered genuine and valid.
 After you’ve entered the review, the account or accommodation name should move from “Reviews to Write” to “Past Reviews You've Written.”

 Small bedrooms often have small closets. To maximize your space, you want to make the most of the closet you have. One good way to to do this is to install a second rod below the one that's already installed.


You can buy an adjustable closet rod in any home improvement store. This will allow you to hang clothes on a second level, doubling the amount of hanger space.
 Another way to increase your hanger space is with coordinated hangers. These are hangers that hang on one another. They allow you to hang two or more items together, each on its own hanger.You can also buy slimmer hangers. These take up less space on the rod. They are often designed to be coordinated as well.
 Another option is to install shelves or place storage furniture in the closet. This allows you to get more items up off the floor.If you can fit storage furniture such as your dresser in your closet, this also frees up space in your room.If you have a lot of shoes, consider a shoe storage unit that hangs on the inside of your closet door. This is another great way to save floor space.

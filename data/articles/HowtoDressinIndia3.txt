 If you are a foreigner traveling to India, it’s a good idea to keep any valuables like your wallet or passport in a money pouch close to your body or in a secure pocket.This may not be necessary if you are visiting a small town. However, large cities (not just in India, but in most countries) can hold thieves and opportunists who will try to steal from tourists.
 In addition to keeping your valuables close, it’s a good idea to avoid wearing diamonds, expensive watches, or other obviously expensive jewelry that could attract thieves. Instead, opt for your jewelry items that do not contain gems or precious metals.


Many women in India wear jewelry, so you shouldn’t be deterred from wearing jewelry if you usually do. Just use common sense to pick pieces that aren’t extremely valuable or dripping in rubies.
 If you are traveling to India as a tourist, it’s important to feel comfortable and good in the clothing that you are wearing. If you are not of Indian or South-Asian decent, you will be recognized as a tourist and may attract some stares. That’s why it’s important to wear clothing that makes you feel comfortable and good!

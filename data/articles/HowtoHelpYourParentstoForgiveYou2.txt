 You may not believe your behavior was completely in the wrong, so instead of looking at the situation as a whole, focus on specific aspects. You may not have done everything wrong, but it isn't likely you did everything right. Find areas of improvement and own them. Your parents will appreciate your ability to admit you were wrong as a sign of maturity. This will help them forgive you more quickly.


Do not argue fault or try to deny wrongdoing. Your parents may see this as immature and take even longer to forgive you.
 Showing remorse is important to help anyone forgive. When giving an apology, acknowledge the hurtful behavior, why it was wrong and how it affected others.This will demonstrate you understand what you did wrong and validate your parents' feelings.


Try structuring the apology stating the effects of your behavior first. This will show others you are most remorseful about hurting them. For example, "I'm sorry worried and disappointed you by sneaking out. My behavior was irresponsible and inconsiderate; I assure you it won't happen again."
Always be sincere when apologizing. Insincere apologies will probably be interpreted as sarcasm and make the situation worse.
If you struggle with personal apologies, try writing it in a letter.
 Make a genuine effort to compensate the offended parties. Depending on what happened, this may not be possible, but a good faith attempt is usually enough to buy considerable goodwill with parents.


You might consider working off debt or providing physical labor to help restore damaged property.

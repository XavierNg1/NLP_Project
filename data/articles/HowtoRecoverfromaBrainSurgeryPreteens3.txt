 Remind your parent or guardian to schedule a meeting with your teacher, principal, school nurse, and support staff several weeks before returning to school.If you are being treated by an educational psychologist, it may be helpful for them to accompany you.


Have your parent or guardian take along with them to the meeting your health records, and have them share with the staff any documents about returning to school, and potential learning disabilities caused by the surgery.
 It is likely that even after being allowed to return to school, you will show signs of complications from time to time while in class. Give the teacher, nurse, and support staff the emergency contact numbers for your doctor or hospital support team. Also give them a list of what to look for.


Other situations where the doctor should be called include: potential exposure to chickenpox or measles; swelling, redness, or pus around any external tubing in your head; or nosebleeds, bruising, red, black or brown urine, red or black stools., Have your parent or guardian give the staff a list of special allowances that will help you readjust to being back at school.

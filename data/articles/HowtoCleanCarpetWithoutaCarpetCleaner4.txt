 Make it a habit for everyone in your household to remove their shoes before they step inside and walk on the carpet. If you have guests over, ask them to please remove their shoes before walking onto the carpet. This will reduce the amount of dirt and debris on the carpet.You may set up a shoe rack by the front and back doors to make it easier for people to remove their shoes.
 To protect your carpet and keep it clean, place mats and rugs down in high traffic areas. Have a welcome mat by the door and put rugs in the living room or bedroom. This way, you can clean the mats and rugs by running them through the washer or by vacuuming them. This will save you from having to do major cleans on your carpet.
 To really keep your carpet fresh, nothing beats a deep clean. Try to do this at least once a year. Do the deep clean yourself or hire a professional carpet cleaner to come in and do this for you. To do a deep clean of the carpet yourself, you may want to invest in a steam cleaner.If you use a steam cleaner on your carpets, you can use a vinegar and water solution to clean the carpets. As the carpet dries, the vinegar smell will fade, leaving you with clean, fresh carpet.

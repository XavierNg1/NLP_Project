 The pineapple juice will already give this cocktail a sweet taste, but if you'd like something even sweeter, add a handful of cotton candy into the glass. Try to fill the glass up to the brim with cotton candy. Don't worry, the cotton candy will dissolve the instant you add the liquid.;
, This will help chill the martini.
 If you don't like pineapple juice, you can try another type of juice, such as cranberry.
 This will mix everything together as well as chill it.
 If you added any cotton candy into the glass, you'll see it disappear the moment the mixture touches it.
 Try to balance the cotton candy on the rim of the glass, but don't let it touch the martini, or it will disappear. If you can't get it to balance, spear it onto a cocktail stick instead, and put the stick into the martini.

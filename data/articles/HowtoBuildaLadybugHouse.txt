 A shoebox or thick card-stock is a good weight.;
,, One side should be free of a cover; this will form the entrance.
 In case you didn't know, ladybugs are attracted to: light blue, pink and yellow. Here is one possible look you could try:


Paint or cover the box in light blue.

Paint or glue on pink and yellow flowers.

The inside doesn't have to be painted, unless you really want it to be.
, Ladybugs are really attracted to water. They spend their entire lifespan searching for it. So, it's a good idea to also make a tiny pool that will accompany the ladybug house, alongside it. Out of tin foil, create a pool that is about 5 inches (12.4cm) long and very, very shallow, like half the size of a ladybug. If you have a small Styrofoam plate, all the better!

,


Fill it with tap water (optional) .

Add rocks, leaves, and/or dirt, but not too many or it will weigh down the house.

Also add a lightly damp paper towel (don't put to much, it can harm it), folded up into the interior.

Throw in some tiny crumbs of cheese,pieces of no citrus fruit, and/or meat for good measure.
 Place the tiny pool right next to it. Spray the whole ladybug hotel with a sweet, fruity perfume (optional) , give it an hour or two, and you should see some ladybugs taking up residence!

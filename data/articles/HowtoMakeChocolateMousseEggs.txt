 Put these pieces into the saucepan.;
, Add these chunks to the chocolate pieces.
 Allow the chocolate and butter to melt slowly, stirring occasionally.
 Leave it to cool.
 Add the yolks into the melted chocolate mixture and mix well after each egg yolk is added.
 Once firmed up, fold these into the chocolate and egg yolk mixture gently.
 Try to slice the tops off at an angle, so that you can have the mousse build up the missing part of the egg.


Have some spares available in case of accidents, as sometimes the egg may simply crack down the joins and you'll need to eat it and use another one instead!

, Bring the mousse up as high as the top edge of the egg at its highest point after cutting. Slip each egg into an egg cup or an egg carton that has had the lid removed from it.
 Leave the mousse to set for three hours.
 Just before serving, sprinkle some sprinkles or colored sugar over the top for an extra decorative effect, or stick a small solid chocolate egg in for another chocolate bonus.


Serve in individual egg cups. If you don't have these, use a small glass or a dipping bowl to hold up each egg and place in the middle of a large plate. You could also drizzle a chocolate or berry coulis around the plate.

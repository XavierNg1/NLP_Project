 To open .rar files, you will need to have a compatible application installed. Because the .rar archive file format is proprietary, there are few applications available which can execute or play RAR files.


Purchase a copy of WinRar or download a free trial of the software from RARLAB's website. WinRar is an application offered by the developer of the .rar format.;
, Once WinRar is installed on your system you will be able to play or execute a .rar file by clicking on the file. The WinRar application will automatically unpack and reassemble the file for execution or playback.

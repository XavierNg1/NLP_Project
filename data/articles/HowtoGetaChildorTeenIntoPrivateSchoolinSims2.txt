 The first element to the Headmaster Scenario is the tour of the House. This can potentially earn a maximum 45 points. How you win this scenario is by having the best possible Room Score.;
,
Plenty of lighting around the house. It doesn't have to be expensive lighting, the area just has to be well-lit.
Artworks within the house and trees and a well maintained small garden outside the house all help to add to your score. The environment score is very important.
 In extreme cases, this can lead the Headmaster in leaving the lot the minute he gets there. He doesn't even need to enter the house.


Unpaid or ignored bills.
Broken objects.
Weeds in your garden.
Unpainted walls or a room with no roof.
 Some examples include a hot tub, the Myshuno game, or a bar. These things are bonuses and will make your score go up higher. You have to get the Headmaster to do these things with you.
 You have one hour to greet the Headmaster or they will leave. When he arrives, you have six hours to reach 90 points to win the scenario.
 The best meal that has worked are pork chops. Salmon is also a very good choice. Even if your Sim has all cooking points and is able to make lobster thermidor, it is a highly flammable dish and for most of the time, if you're not careful, can catch on fire. Start making dinner about 30 minutes before the Headmaster arrives, so it will be ready.
 It is one of the "entertain" interactions. Enter a room and click "show room". You can do this with multiple rooms, but make sure that they are clean.
 If you don't have 90 by the end of the visit, the Head does not accept your sim-child and the parents and kid are left with a bad memory for being rejected. Don't fret over it. You can try again next time. And then, you'll have the smarts for it.

 Pomade is a hair product made of water-soluble solution. It helps hair achieve a clean shine and is a popular choice for holding undercut hair for men in place. Pomade is a suitable product for slicking undercut hair back or to the side., Styling wax is a hair product that gives your hair a smooth, soft texture but also creates definition. Styling wax might feel tacky in the hair and is thicker than gel, pomade, and other hair products.One potential styling combination is to slick your undercut hair back with styling wax, then blasting it with a hair dryer for twenty to thirty seconds to achieve more volume.
 Hairstyling cream (sometimes called “styling cream”) is the best choice for styling undercut hair for men that is curly or frizzy. In undercut hair for men, styling cream provides a natural shine and creates the impression that the undercut hair is thicker. It also has moisturizing properties to keep your hair healthy. Hairstyling cream allows the undercut hair more movement than styling wax or pomade, and is a good choice when you want you wish to give the hair more freedom.
 Hair gel offers the hair only limited movement. Hair gel is good for styling undercut hair with definition, shine, and texture. If, for instance, you want to style undercut hair into a spiked or other vertically-oriented shape, hair gel is your best bet.Hair gel tends to be thinner in consistency than pomade and often has a range of holding strengths, from “lightweight” to ‘’heavyweight.”Gels are easier to wash out of the hair than pomades and waxes.
 If the recipient of the undercut has wavy hair, use a wide-toothed comb to manipulate it. If they have straight hair, use a conventional comb. You can comb the hair to the side or slick it straight back., Men may want to wear the undercut with or without facial hair. An undercut looks great with a long beard, a short beard, or no beard at all. Getting your undercut with a nicely trimmed beard, though, can give you a more classic look.

 If you want to go to a movie or you'd like a new game or toy, offer to do some chores around the house in exchange for the money you need to pay for it. Your mom might be so impressed at the offer that she'll go ahead and say yes.
 Say you really wanted to go to a party, but your mom is stubbornly saying no because she doesn't want you to be out that late. Why not offer to come home an hour earlier? If it goes well, maybe the next time she'll let you stay out as late as you want.
 Kids say this all the time, but does it ever really work? Moms don't care much about going along with the crowd. Only say this if you're asking for something that literally everyone else is getting to do, and have a list of people your mom respects who get to do it. Be ready to have your friends back you up if your mom says she wants to call them or their parents.
 It'll just make you seem immature, making your mom feel like she's making the right decision in saying "no". You've got to give her a good reason to say yes, and begging is just annoying. If you cannot get her to say "yes" in any way, a guilt trip might come to your rescue in the end. Use statements like "No, it's okay. Love you mom." and walk downstairs. Later she will come to tell you that you can go, because you just let it go like a mature person.
 Lighten things up by telling a joke or teasing your mom to make her laugh. Even if you're upset she's saying no, saying something funny can turn things right around. It shows your mom that you realize it's not the end of the world, and you're not going to throw a tantrum like a little kid. Who knows, her enhanced mood might make her change her mind.
 It works like a charm to make moms feel happy. Don't let it sound fake - say it like you mean it, even if you're feeling mad. The power of these three words cannot be underestimated!

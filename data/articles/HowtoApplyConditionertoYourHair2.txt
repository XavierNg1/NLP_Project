 As with regular conditioner, there are many varieties of leave-in conditioner depending on your needs. There are two general styles of leave-in conditioner: cream and spray-on. The former variety is best for thick, long, or curly hair, as it weighs down the strands a bit. The latter variety is best for thin or straight hair, as it is a bit lighter-weight.
 Go about your regular hair treatment regimen. Leave-in conditioner does not need to be rinsed out (as the name suggests) but does need to be applied to damp hair. Use the aforementioned directions for washing and conditioning your hair, and then towel-dry it so that it is just damp.
 Most products will recommend a pea-sized amount for medium length hair of average thickness, but the amount will vary from person to person. You can always add more product to your hair, so begin with less than you think you will need.
 Rub your hands together to thin out the conditioner a bit, and then begin running it through the ends of your locks. As with regular conditioner, avoid getting it near your scalp or the roots of your hair; keep it on the most damaged (oldest) parts of your hair, typically from half the length downwards.
 Use a wide-tooth comb to brush your hair after applying the leave-in conditioner. This will spread the product out even further, and help to avoid clumps of the conditioner from making certain sections of your hair greasy while others are left dry.

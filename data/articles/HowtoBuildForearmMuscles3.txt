 This exercise requires you to be in a sitting stationary position, so take a seat at the edge of your workout bench. You also want to have your feet flat and your knees shoulder-width apart., Since this is specifically targeting your wrists and forearms, you will want to start with less weight than you typically use for full-arm curls. You can start with as little as five-pound weights in each hand and increase them incrementally if they prove far too easy.


If you prefer, you can always work just one forearm at a time, which means you can pick up just one weight. Make sure you do the same number of sets and repetitions with each forearm to ensure an equal workout.
 By resting your arm on your leg, you put the majority of the weight on your forearm instead of your bicep. This position also braces your arm, which allows you to perform the curls with less risk of injury.
 Each rep of this workout requires curling the weight up and toward you and then back down. You additionally want to ensure that you breathe out while curling the weight and that you inhale while lowering it.To get the most out of this exercise, try performing sets of both upward and downward wrist curls. Upward means your palm is facing up, so the weight rests against it. Downward means your palm is facing down, so the weight rests mostly against your fingers. Each direction will work different forearm muscle groups., If you have chosen the ideal amount of weight for this exercise, then you should be able to do a set of twelve-to-fifteen repetitions and just barely be able to perform the final one.

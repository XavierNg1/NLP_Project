 There are five Big Octos available in the game, each found on separate locations, namely:


Two Eyed Reef – South of the map
Diamond Steppe Island – Southwest corner of the map
Fire Mountain – Northeast of the map, two spaces below the Seven Star Isles
Seven Star Isles – Northeast of the map
Tingle Island – Northwest, near the center of the map;
, Once you’re at the part of the sea near the areas mentioned above, ride your boat around the waters and look for a flock of seagulls along the horizon. Once you find one, sail towards the spot where the birds are flying, and you should see a Big Octo.
 Once you get close to a Big Octo, it will try to suck you in using a whirlpool in the water. Using the directional keys or the analog stick on your game controller, move your boat around the monster, backing away when you’re getting a little too close to avoid getting sucked in.


If you do get sucked into the whirlpool, the monster will spit you out and throw you on the far side of the map.
 To defeat the giant creature, you need to destroy all of its eyes (Big Octos have 5 to 8 eyes).Take out your boomerang or your bow and arrow, and press the “Aim” button to focus your sight at the monster’s eyes. Press the “Action” button to fire your projectile weapon at the eye of the monster.


Keep doing this until you’ve destroyed all of the monster’s eyes and kill it.
 Once the Big Octo is destroyed, move your boat to where the center of the whirlpool used to be, and use the Salvage Crane of your boat to retrieve the sunken treasure. Once retrieved, the chest will open and you’ll be able to get the heart.

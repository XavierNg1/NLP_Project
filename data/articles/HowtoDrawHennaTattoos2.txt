 In order to create a henna paste and apply a henna tattoo, you will need a few basic supplies. You are going to need two black tea bags, water and a kettle (to make tea), one plastic baggie, and a small plastic bottle with a pointed lid. You will also want to keep some paper towels handy, because henna can be a bit messy.You can find a small plastic bottle with a pointed lid at either a craft store (they are typically used for paint) or a beauty supplies store (they are typically used for hair dye).
 Boil 1 cup of water in a kettle and add your tea bags. Remove tea from heat and allow it to cool completely. You can place it in the refrigerator to speed up the process.
 Mix 3-4 Tbs. of cold black tea with 2 Tbs. of henna powder in a plastic bag. Move the baggie around in your hands to ensure that it is evenly blended and all lumps have been worked out. Let this mixture sit for two hours.








Your paste should be the consistency of cake batter.
 Using a pair of scissors, cut one corner off your plastic baggie containing the paste. They squeeze the henna paste through this opening and into the small plastic bottle. You will use this bottle to apply the henna paste to your skin.








Depending on the size of your design, you may want to begin by transferring just a little of your paste.
Any remaining unused paste can be kept in a sealed container in your refrigerator for up to two weeks.
Using a small bottle is preferable to applying the paste with a paintbrush.

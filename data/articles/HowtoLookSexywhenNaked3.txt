 If you feel that you would feel sexier by making changes to your body, begin by reviewing your diet. A poor diet can not only contribute to an undesirable weight, but it can also affect your energy and mood. If you find that your diet consists of food that does not benefit your body, begin to make changes. Reduce your sugar intake, and try to eliminate processed foods. Make sure that you get your recommended daily intake of fruits, vegetables, grains, etc.Changing your diet doesn’t have to mean eliminating all of the food you love. Instead of having a chocolate bar every day, reserve a special day or two to eat one.
 Exercising is great for your mood as well as your body. Exercising is important even if you don’t want a dramatic weight loss. Look for a physical activity that you enjoy. Try running, dancing, tennis, or swimming. Do that activity at least twice a week if possible.You can make the activity fun by doing it with a partner.
 Do a quick workout the morning or hour before you will be naked. This will temporarily tone your body. Go on a quick run, do a set of weights, or do a set of lunges and pushups., A happy, healthy mindset will help you feel sexy and confident. If possible, take a few minutes out of every day for self-care. If that’s not possible, set aside an hour a week. You can take a warm bath with scented oils, try out a face mask, or work on meditation. Do whatever makes you feel calm and happy.

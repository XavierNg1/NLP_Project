 Every new season, different shades and hues become fashionable. If you want to convey trendiness, finding a dress in a trendy color can do that.


Check out recent fashion magazines. Usually there will be lots of information about which colors are trending this season.
Browse the clothes in stores. Look at the new arrivals on the racks in stores that sell the kinds of clothes you want to wear. What colors do you see over and over? Those are probably the colors that are trending.
Watch what women on TV and in movies are wearing. New movies and TV episodes are another great way to find out the latest color trends. Watch the characters who are the most fashionable. What colors are they wearing?

, Usually several different color schemes are in style each season. Which ones match your coloring?

, Even if you don’t look great in the trendiest colors, it doesn’t mean you can’t wear them at all. There are other ways to sneak the color into your outfit.


The further away from your face a color is, the less it matters if it flatters your coloring. Wear an unflattering, trendy color at the bottom of a long dress or in your tights.
Wear unflattering but trendy colors in accessories away from your face like shoes or bracelets.
Sometimes a little more makeup will do the trick too. Concealer, foundation, and blush can help tired, sallow skin look more lively, and as a result, you’ll look better in more colors.

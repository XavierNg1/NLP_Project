 Smiling is physical, but anyone can smile at anytime.  Smiling will make people around you (including yourself), feel more happy and bright.  Someone who smiles all the time is really attractive.  Smiling will make you seem approachable. Whenever you see someone (even if you don't know them very well or at all), shine a big smile at them, chances are they'll smile back.
 Don't try to show off too much or boast.  Having pride, dignity, and confidence is definitely a must, but don't overdo it and let someone else have the spotlight on them every once in a while.  Try not to be too overly loud or annoying. This may seem attractive to the people who act this way, but it really is not.
 Kindness is a must! Always give compliments to everyone you know, maybe even strangers.Always offer to do favors for people and help others whenever you can. Treat others the way you would like to be treated.  Unfortunately, nowadays many people are rude and ignorant, so don't be like that.
 Always smile, always laugh, and always seem happy.  Of course you don't have to be 24/7, because we are all human and we all cry and frown, but don't let it show.  Try to have a good temper and think of the good side.
 Bravery is also important. Be willing to meet new people and speak for yourself. Don't let anyone tell you you can't do something.  As corny as it sounds, if you believe you can do it, you can.  Don't think, act, is a good motto.
 Whenever a friend needs something, offer to help them achieve it.  Always be there for the people you love.  Friends are people who will help you get through rough times, and that will always support you, forever.
 Be confident in everything you do, sit or stand up straight, take a deep breath, and believe you can do it.  Don't let others push you off your throne. You own yourself, so you can do whatever you want. Always be happy, healthy, and confident, of course, charming.

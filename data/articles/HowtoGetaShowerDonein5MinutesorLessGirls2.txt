 Having a regular shower routine can keep you at a steady pace and on schedule. Try to do your shower activities in the same order so that you don’t even have to hesitate or think about what you are doing., Try to maximize the time that you have in the shower by consolidating some of your shower activities! For instance, you apply and rub shampoo into your hair, then wash your body while you let the shampoo cleanse your hair. Once you finish washing, you can rinse the shampoo out of your hair and then apply your conditioner, then multitask in a similar way while the conditioner soaks into your hair., Shampooing and conditioning your hair is often what takes the largest chunk of time in the shower, especially if you have particularly long hair. To cut the time it takes to wash your hair, use a two-in-one shampoo and conditioner. These products can be equally as effective as using two separate products, and they can shave off a significant amount of time from your shower., Another great way to keep on schedule is to decide roughly how long you want to spend on each shower activity. For instance, you may decide to spend two minutes applying shampoo and washing your body, one minute rinsing out your shampoo and applying conditioner, and two minutes finishing washing your body and rinsing out your conditioner.
 If you’re really serious about shortening the time of your shower, consider turning down the temperature of the water midway through the shower. A hot, luxurious shower can be difficult to get out of, but if you turn down the water temperature to a temperature that is not as comfortable, it can be a powerful motivation to get out quicker.Never turn the water to a temperature that is too uncomfortable. Instead, turn the water from hot to lukewarm, rather than freezing.

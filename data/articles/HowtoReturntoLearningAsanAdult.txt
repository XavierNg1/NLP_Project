 But if it also means that soon you will have a career which is satisfying and is paying the bills - cherish these bonuses.;
, How have you spent them and what made you happy or unhappy?

, For example, if doing bookkeeping at your last job stressed you out you probably should not pursue an accounting degree.
 If you enjoyed maintaining the company website at your last job, you may also enjoy taking some online classes in graphic design and web design.
 What were your favorite subjects and hobbies? What did you want to be when you grew up? Does what you do now have anything to do with those subjects, hobbies and dreams?

, You don't have to decide "what you want to be when you grow up" right away.
 Set aside the time to do the homework - make yourself into a role model for the kids. Do homework together. Set up a study centre in your home or track everyone down to the local library for an afternoon of study.
 Not everything has to be done perfectly - you will give yourself ulcers. Do the best you can and learn from the feedback given to you by your teachers. Your home will survive the odd bit of dust. Teach family members how to vacuum, gain new cooking skills and become responsible for household cleanups.
 Flashcards; audiotape information to be played while driving the car or cooking the dinner; coloured highlighters for key points; teach someone else; diagrams; lists and learn recall strategies.
 Yes, sometimes study can go awry but ask, ask and ask again for help from a range of people: your teacher, your peers, family, counsellors. Persistence is the key.

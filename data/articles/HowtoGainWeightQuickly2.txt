 While cardio will develop some of your muscles, weight training alone is more likely to cause you to gain weight, since muscle weighs more than fat.


This does not mean you have to join a gym (though that certainly would work!). Do push-ups, crunches, lunges, and squats in the comfort of your own home while watching TV.
Exercising also builds up your appetite. After a workout, slam a protein bar or shake to give your muscles what they're craving.
 As you progress, what you've been doing will not be enough. Your muscles will get used to the work you're putting them through--as your workouts get easier, change them up to make them more difficult.


Invest in weights for your home. That way, when you only have 15 minutes before you have to get ready for work, you can squeeze in a quick muscle-building session to stay on the right track.
 The simple "more calories out than in" motto is true. So apart from bulking up, burn as few calories as possible. Grab the remote, your smoothie, and hanker down on the couch.


If you do become more sedentary overall, it's important to keep weight training. Even if you can't see the fat on your body, visceral fat (the kind stored around your abdominal cavity, liver, pancreas, and intestines) can still show up. And visceral fat loves inactivity. So before you sit down to watch that movie, pump some iron. Then have a marathon--a movie marathon--with some snacks.

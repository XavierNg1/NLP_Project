 They may look nice and shiny, but your counter tops could still be susceptible to damage from water and other liquids.


Pour a little bit of water on the granite.
If the water beads up quickly, then your job is done.
If the water seeps into the stone, then you still have work to do and should continue on to the next step.
 The sealer should be applied to clean, dry counter tops, so if you just performed the water test, make sure the counter is completely dry before spraying on the sealer.


Test the sealer by spraying it on a small, inconspicuous spot on the counter top.
Work in small sections to avoid over-spraying, and wipe the sealer evenly and gently across the entire surface.
Wipe for approximately 3-5 minutes with a clean, soft, cotton cloth until the counter top is dry.
 This time may vary depending on the product you are using. Make sure to read the instructions carefully.
 At this point, pour a little more water on the counter top. If it beads up, then you're finally done. If not, it's time to apply another coat of the sealer and repeat those steps.

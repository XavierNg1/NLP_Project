 It should be inspiring. A cover with only one colour and no patterns would be perfect as you can decorate it with photographs and drawings of yourself or your favourite things.;
, You can also include starters about your un/favourite things to do such as "I like eating...", "My favourite film is..." and so on. Write at least 12 sentence starters. After you've finished add your personal information and pictures. Add descriptions if you like, so that it will be more interesting.
 You can embellish it with doodles, zig-zags and colours.
 Write about what seems more relevant such as if you're feeling particularly hungry that day you may write "I feel like eating a candy bar right this instant. Think about a chocolate twice my size. I can see myself licking it, gnawing it carefully...". Once you start your imagination will flow.
 If you want it to be completely private, considering keeping your Life Book in a computer and password protecting it until it's finished. DO NOT purchase one of those diaries with locks as they break fairly easily.
 If you are feeling uninspired follow the same procedures as you did when you started.
 If you typed it, it is time to print and bind it. If you are writing in the computer than consider having it one hundred pages as that is a reasonable amount to tell the story of your life. If your story is typed you can change fonts and add images more easily. However, a notebook never looses it's beauty and charm.

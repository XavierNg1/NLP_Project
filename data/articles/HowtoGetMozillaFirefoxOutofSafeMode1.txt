 This is the â˜° symbol on your Firefox window. Safe mode is a temporary state that your browser will not return to unless specified. In most cases, all you will need to do in order to exit safe mode is to restart Firefox.;
, This will close you out of your Firefox session. To ensure that you are completely closed out of Firefox, restart your computer., If you find that you are still in safe mode, you may be "stuck" in the state and you should continue on to another method. If Firefox crashes when you open it and then shows you the safe mode window, you may have a larger problem on your hands and you need to troubleshoot Firefox.

 Everybody likes to hear positive things about themselves. Make this girl feel good about herself by giving her compliments. Compliment her on her sense of humor, her hairstyle, how well she does her job, and so on. Some people start to feel uncomfortable with too many compliments. Keep your compliments light yet meaningful, and don’t go overboard.
 Personalize the phone call by using the girl’s name periodically throughout your conversation. Don’t say her name at the start of every sentence, but throw it in casually every now and then so she feels special., It can be difficult to convey that you are listening to someone, since you can’t rely on eye contact and body language. But you can do other things to show that you’re listening to what the girl is saying.Try agreeing with or reacting to her statements, such as, “Really?” or “Oh no!”


If you pay attention to what she says, she’ll feel encouraged to keep talking.
 Keep the conversation going by focusing only on her. Don’t check your email or surf the internet while you’re talking to her. She can tell when you’re distracted and will feel like you’re not interested in giving her your full attention.

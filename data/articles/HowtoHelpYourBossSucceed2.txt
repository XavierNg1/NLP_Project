 You may have thought of a better way to split up responsibilities, but don't just nod your head in agreement and then keep on doing it the old way. If the organizational structure follows some standard , then get to know the standard.
 There's never going to be enough staff, time, money, space, technology, etc. for the workload. Understand how your boss has decided to mix and match these resources.
 Here's an example of where the team offloads work from the boss. Don't expect the boss to be equally effective in all phases of a project, all processes, all skills. Consider any project plan to be a framework and fill in the empty areas.
 If there are already metrics in place, use them and study the results. Yes, you can learn from disasters, but you'll need metrics to gradually improve your processes when you've eliminated disasters. If the team doesn't already have metrics, then invent your own and measure yourself. Create a metric, gather and analyze the data and study the results. Once the metric has served its purpose, turn to another area to improve - drop the first metric and start another.
 After the completion of every project have a debriefing of what went right and what could be improved. This would normally be the responsibility of a manager to set this up, but the team is perfectly capable of doing this on their own.

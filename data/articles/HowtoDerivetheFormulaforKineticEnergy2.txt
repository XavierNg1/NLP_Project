 The work that is done on an object is related to the change in its kinetic energy. 


ΔK=W{\displaystyle \Delta K=W}


, Note that using algebra alone in this derivation restricts us to constant acceleration.


ΔK=FΔx=maΔx{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Delta K&=F\Delta x\\&=ma\Delta x\end{aligned}}}

Here, Δx{\displaystyle \Delta x} is the displacement. 


, There are several constant acceleration kinematic equations that relate time, displacement, velocity, and acceleration. The "timeless" equation which does not contain time is below. 


v2=v02+2aΔx{\displaystyle v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2a\Delta x}

When an object starts from rest, v0=0.{\displaystyle v_{0}=0.}


, Remember, initial velocity is 0.


a=v22Δx{\displaystyle a={\frac {v^{2}}{2\Delta x}}}


,


ΔK=m(v22Δx)Δx=12mv2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Delta K&=m\left({\frac {v^{2}}{2\Delta x}}\right)\Delta x\\&={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}\end{aligned}}}

 Pokémon X and Y introduced the concept of "fishing streaks". This requires you to continuously hook wild Pokémon without pulling up nothing or messing up the reel timing. Increasing your streak will increase the chances of catching a Shiny., Make sure you have plenty of PokéBalls, as well as a fishing rod. You don't need special rods to perform streaks, but the rod you use will determine the level and type of Pokémon that you can catch., You will need Pokémon that can beat any Pokémon that you catch on the rod. You will also want a Pokémon with "Suction Cups" or "Sticky Hold" to be the first Pokémon in your party. This will increase the odds of hooking a wild Pokémon, which is essential for fishing streaks., You can increase your chances for hooking a Pokémon by fishing in an enclosed water tile. For example, if you're fishing from the back of a Pokémon, try to find a tile that is surrounded by the land, a rock, you, and an unfishable deep water tile., Once you've found a good spot, cast your line to start fishing. Press "A" as soon as you see the notice that you have a Pokémon on the line. Any of the following messages or actions will cause the streak to end:

"Nothing seems to be biting..." - This is a random occurrence, but can be mitigated by fishing in an enclosed spot.
"No! You reeled in too fast!" - You pressed the A button too soon.
"No! You reeled in too slow!" - You pressed the A button too late.
Leaving the area.
Starting a battle outside of fishing.
Quitting the game.
 As long as you are successfully hooking Pokémon, your streak will increase. This will increase the odds of finding a Shiny, up to a certain point. Because it is random, there is still the chance that you will not find a Shiny, even after successfully catching numerous Pokémon with your rod.

 You can't be classy or fab if you smell bad. Keep your nails really clean and keep your feet beautiful. If you have the money, don't color your hair by yourself; get it done professionally. So many things can go wrong with at-home kits.;
, This is the art of high and low dressing. Never wear a head-to-toe one designer outfit. If you do, you risk looking like you have no style and you got it from a catalogue. Make sure your accessories are colorful, but do not clash.
 If you look at any designers website there is not the brand's name in huge letters all over the front. Invest in items that are versatile and classic. Don't fill your wardrobe with only "fad" pieces.
 There are great stores with items that are fashionable, but affordable. Some of these are: Forever 21, ZARA, H&M, Target, TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Charlotte Russe. Most of them have high fashion and sell clothing lines with guest designers.
 For girls with purses: fake designer is fine, as long as you get a nice quality one.


If you don't want to waste money on a fake, just get a nice Kate Spade or a cute bag from TJ Maxx, Forever21, or H&M.
PRADA, GUCCI, HERMES, LOUIS VUITTON, CHANEL, BALENCIAGA, FENDI, MARC JACOBS, and COACH are all classy labels, if you want to go the expensive route.
 An expensive pair of jeans is always great. They have amazing fits, and it is good to wear the hell out of one pair, but you don't have to have all of your jeans cost over 200 bucks. H&M, Forever 21, and Levi's have good jeans too.
 Don't try to be so cool and not shake people's hands when you meet them. Have table manners. being well-bred is the way to charm people and get what you want.
 Being too nice is annoying. Don't be mean for no reason either though. Bitchiness is annoying and shows immaturity.
 Hooking up with people you don't know is always stupid. People will find out and will talk about you.

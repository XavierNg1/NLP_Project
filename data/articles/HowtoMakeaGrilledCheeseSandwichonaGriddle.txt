, The butter will melt quickly, so make sure to spread it wherever you will put bread.
 Lay one slice of bread on the griddle. Then add the sliced cheese - you should have enough cheese to cover the whole piece of bread. More cheese makes for a messier sandwich, but you can add as much as you want - it's a matter of personal preference.


You can also add shredded cheese on top of the sliced cheese, as this will make for a different flavor and texture, and the shredded cheese will melt more quickly than sliced cheese.
If you want to add any other toppings (tomatoes, ham or turkey, vegetables, etc.), do so now.
, The bottom slice of bread should be golden brown but not burned, and the cheese should be just beginning to melt. Be careful when flipping to keep the sandwich from falling apart.


If you find that the bread is browning or even burning before the cheese melts properly, turn the heat down.
 Then remove sandwich from griddle. Let cool for a minute or two, then cut in half diagonally and serve.

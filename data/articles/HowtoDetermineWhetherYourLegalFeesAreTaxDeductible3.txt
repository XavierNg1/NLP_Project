 If the legal expense is a business expense, you may deduct it on IRS Form Schedule C (Form 1040), line 17 or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040 or 1040-EZ).


If the expenses are personal, you can itemize the expenses on the same form, or take the standard deduction, depending on your situation. If you will not itemize expenses, personal legal fees are not tax deductible.
 You can find the current standard deduction for your filing status by looking at the left hand margin on line 40 of IRS Form 1040 (“Form 1040”). The best way to decide whether you will take the standard deduction or will itemize expenses is to fill out IRS Form Schedule A (“Schedule A”), and see which gives you the largest deduction. To fill out Schedule A:


Fill in your medical and dental expenses on line 1, and then follow the instructions for lines 2 - 4.
Fill in lines 5 - 8 with the amounts you paid for the listed taxes, then add the amounts together to complete line 9.
Fill in lines 10 – 14 with the amount you paid for the types of interest listed, then add the amount together and complete line 15.
Provide information about your charitable gifts and casualty and theft losses on lines 16 – 20.
Include your total personal legal expenses on line 21 and/or line 22.
Follow the instructions for lines 23 – 29 to calculate your total itemized expenses.
 If you will itemize expenses, determine if the personal legal expenses fall under one of the following two categories. If the expense does not fall under one of these categories, it is not a deductible legal expense.


Unreimbursed employee expenses. If the legal expense was related to your employment and your employer did not reimburse you, you can deduct it on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 21 or Schedule A (Form 1040NR), line 7, so long as it was ordinary and necessary expense.
Tax preparation fees. If the expense was for preparation of income tax returns, you may deduct it on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 22 or Schedule A (Form 1040NR), line 8.

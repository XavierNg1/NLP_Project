 You can find System Preferences from the Apple logo on the top menu. It is usually found in the Dock and Applications folder as well.
 If you don't see this, type "keyboard" into the System Preferences search bar and click the highlighted option.
 This button is in the lower right corner of the Keyboard options. Pressing it will open a pop-up window.
 Click the drop-down menu to the right of "Caps Lock Key." Select No Action, then OK. Caps Lock is now disabled.


If you want to undo this change, return to the same menu and click "Restore Defaults" in the lower left corner.

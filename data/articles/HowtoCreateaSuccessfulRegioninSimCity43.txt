Your zone will develop quickly., You should eventually add medium and high density commercial to your commercial city. This will attract offices and higher wealth Sims. The Sims will settle in your residential city and commute to your other two cities to work. Make sure you have good connections between your cities.
 Only develop agriculture in this city. By now, your region should have a very healthy economy.
 By now, you should have several thousand Sims living in your Residential city. You will develop high-tech industry in your Industrial city. And once you have over 45,000 Sims working in your Commercial City, you will get skyscrapers.


At first, your industrial city will have the most workers. Your commercial city will not be far behind. On the other hand, you won't have too many workers in your agricultural city. In time, your Commercial city will overtake your Industrial city in the number of jobs. Your Residential city will grow to have 20,000 or more Sims living in it. It could even have over 100,000! Your region will be thriving by this point.
 You can mix and match types of development to make it fun. Your region should continue to grow around your four core cities.

 Look in your closet and drawers and take note of the kinds of clothes you have already purchased for yourself. You will probably see some patterns of your buying behavior.


Are most of your clothes casual?
Is there a predominant color?
Are all the skirts and dresses ankle length if you like it?
Are most of your clothes made from synthetic fabrics or natural fabrics?
Do you have 15 pairs of slacks and 1 skirt?;
, Only pick clothes that you love and could never part with.



Is it comfortable?
Does it make you feel sexy? Powerful? Fun?
Think about how you feel every time you wear each of your favorite outfits. Is there a common denominator?

, Do you lean towards “fashion over comfort” or “comfort over fashion?”

,


Do you tend to buy clothes that you are drawn to, even if they are utterly impractical for your lifestyle? If so, those clothes are definitely “your style.”
If you gravitate towards hot pink sundresses, but you have to wear a tailored business suit to work, try to take a bit of your style with you every day—add a colorful silk scarf to your ensemble and the longest earrings allowable at your place of employment. You won’t be wearing your hot pink sundress, but you will have a more individual look that expresses your personality.

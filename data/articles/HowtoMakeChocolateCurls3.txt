 50%-70% cacao will do. You may need to chill the chocolate for several hours in the refrigerator before shaving. If you try to use room temperature chocolate for chocolate curls you will end up with thick, broken, chunky pieces of chocolate instead of thin, delicate shavings.


Wrapped blocks of chocolate can be found at most grocery and specialty stores. Regular bars of chocolate will not work as they are too soft.
 Hold the bar of chocolate in one hand -- you may want to hold it in a piece of paper towel to stop the bar from melting in your hand. Slowly and carefully, use the peeler to shave along the length of the bar to form pretty chocolate curls.


Pressing the peeler deeper into the chocolate will result in bigger, more dramatic curls, while drawing it gently across the edges will produce smaller, more delicate curls.

 Combine the horseradish, mustard, oyster sauce, soy sauce and wine in a small bowl. Mix well, combining all the ingredients thoroughly.
 Pour the marinade into it and then place the salmon fillet. Make sure that the marinade covers the flesh of the salmon.


Place the bag in the refrigerator and refrigerate the salmon for 8 hours or overnight.
 Coat the foil with nonstick cooking spray.
 The skin side should be in contact with the pan, and the flesh should be facing you.


Discard the bag with the rest of the marinade.
 The cooking time will vary based on the thickness of your fillet. For every inch (2.5 centimeters) of thickness, you should cook your salmon for 10 minutes. If your fillet is 1.5 inches (4 centimeters) thick, then cook the fillet for 15 minutes.


Regardless of the method you use, the baking times remain the same. So if you find another way to prepare your salmon, still feel free to use this as a guideline.
 At the end of the cooking time, use a fork to spear the top of your fish and to gently check whether or not the fish is flaky. If the pink flesh is flaky, then your salmon is done.


Divide your salmon into 4 equal portions and serve it with a salad, pasta, vegetables, and white wine.

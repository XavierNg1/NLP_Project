 This mask consists of three treatments: exfoliating, a soothing mask, and moisturizing. If you have very dry and flaky skin on your lips, consider skipping the exfoliating treatment and jumping straight to making and applying the mask. If you do choose to use the exfoliating treatment, be sure that you are gentle, so that you do not worsen the condition. Here is a list of what you will need for each part:To make the exfoliating scrub, you will need 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of olive oil.
To make the soothing mask, you will need 1 teaspoon of plain yogurt and Â½ teaspoon of raw honey.
For the moisturizing treatment, you will need a lip balm or a natural oil; an organic lip balm is recommended.
 Combine the sugar and olive oil in a small bowl and stir briskly with a fork until you get a grainy paste. You can use white or brown sugar.
 Use your fingers to spread the scrub over your lips, then gently massage your lips using small, circular movements. This will help get rid of any dead skin cells and reveal the soft, smooth skin underneath.
 Soak a soft, clean towel in warm water, and gently rub the scrub away.
 Both the honey and yogurt will work together to hydrate and soften your lips.
 Use your fingers to spread the mixture all over your lips. It may start to run down your lips, so it might be a good idea to lay down or sit in a chair and tilt your head back.
 Lean over the sink and wash the mask off. Although you used edible ingredients, it is not recommended that you lick the mask off; after sitting on your lips for so long, the yogurt would have gotten a sour taste.
 Simply apply a thin layer of lip balm or natural oil over your lips and blot off any excess with a tissue. Avoid anything containing eucalyptus, menthol, and camphor; these ingredients can dry or irritate your lips.Instead, consider using a natural lip balm or any of the following oils:








Cocoa butter
Coconut oil
Jojoba oil
Olive oil
Shea butter
Sweet almond oil
Vitamin E oil

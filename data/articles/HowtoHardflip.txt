 Push a few times and gain a little speed to start, because this trick requires a bit of momentum to pull off.






;
, The ball of your back foot should be placed close to the middle of your board, in the same position you use for a kickflip. You should be slightly up on the ball of your foot. Place your foot at a 45-degree angle with your toes pointed toward the back of the board and your heel angled toward the front bolts.









When you do the trick, your back foot will shove forward.
 Your front toes should be positioned at the front edge of the board, with your heel angled toward the back. Rise up so that your weight is on the ball of your foot.









When you do the trick, your front foot will shove off to the side to cause the board to flip.
 Use your back foot to pop the board straight up so that it pops vertically at a 90-degree angle to the ground. You'll do this the same way you would for a frontside shove it.
 So you'll pop and scoop with your back foot like you would for a frontside pop shove it while at the same time flicking strait behind you and also sort of up.









It's important to make sure your front foot gets out of the way after the shove, so the board can flip completely around.
Once you learn hardflips you will want to slowly practice scooping more and more up and out in order to make the board flip as vertically as possible, rather than more horizontally like you would for a frontside shove it.
 When the board completes the vertical part of the flip and is tipping toward the ground, stomp down hard to catch the board and land the trick.









Keep your body over the board the whole time.It can be easier to learn how to land on your front foot, but keep practicing until you can land the trick on both feet.

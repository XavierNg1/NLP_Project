 If you're petite, a huge wide-brimmed hat could totally overwhelm you. Instead of using size to make a visual statement, choose a hat with bold colors or vibrant trim instead.
 You can wear a small hat to one side and twist a chignon on the opposite side. This effect also makes your neck appear longer.



If your face is round, choose a hat that has a broad brim to balance out the fullness of your face.
If your face is long, choose a softer design or something with movement, like feathers.
For a square-shaped face, choose an asymmetrical hat to balance the angle of your jawline.
People with heart-shaped faces are the luckiest. They can carry off almost any type of hat., If you have a bold hat, tone down your makeup so that you don't look clownish.
 If you're wearing a dress with a peacock pattern, then try a hat with a jaunty peacock feather to unify the outfit. However, if your hat is bold, tone down accessories like jewelry so that you don't look garish.
 This advice may sound obvious, but the last thing you want to do is to spend your entire day clutching your hat against your head. Use thin elastic bands, ribbons or combs to make sure that your hat stays in place.

 The waffle stitch requires a specific number of stitches, so you will need to count as you cast on. Your total number of stitches should be a multiple of three plus one additional stitch at the end.For example, you could cast on 30 stitches then add one more for a total of 31 stitches, or cast on 12 stitches plus one for a total of 13 stitches.;
, To begin the pattern, knit a stitch and then follow that with a purl stitch. Repeat this pattern of knitting and purling all the way to the end of the row. Finish the row with a knit stitch., For the second row, begin by purling one stitch and then knitting the next stitch. This row will be just the opposite of your first row. Finish the row with a purl stitch., Your third row will be all knit stitches. Knit all stitches to the end of the row., Your fourth row will be all purl stitches. Purl all of the stitches until you reach the end of the row., To continue working the waffle stitch, repeat the sequence over again starting with the first row (alternating between knitting and purling). Continue to work the rows in sequence until your project is the desired length.Cast off as usual to finish your project.

 In a situation that absolutely requires you to move the victim, do it in the least damaging way possible. Grab their shirt collar and use your forearms to support their head while pulling the body in a straight line. This is a preferred method as the victim's head is braced while moving.
 Alternately, hold the victim and pull them by both feet, both shoulders, or both arms pulled over their shoulders. Do NOT pull by one arm or leg, as this will twist the body.
 Do not pull the body sideways! Emergency medical staff immobilize the spine with a rigid neck collar and a carrying board.If you must move the body, simulate this type of support by pulling the body only straight. The goal is to minimize movement in the neck and spine as much as possible.


If injury occurs in the water, keep the victim afloat until someone can obtain a rigid board to slide under their head and torso as far down as their buttocks. If you can’t get a board, get help from other people to get the victim out of the water by moving them as one unit. Support their head and body, as if on a stiff board, and don’t let their neck bend or rotate., If you must roll a spinal injury victim over to prevent choking on blood or vomit, get a second person to help you. Coordinate your timing so that you roll the victim over in such a way that the neck, back, and torso move as one unit. Do not allow the body to twist.

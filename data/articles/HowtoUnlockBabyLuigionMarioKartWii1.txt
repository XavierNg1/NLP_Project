 You will need to unlock 8 Expert Staff Ghosts. Ghost Data are replays that you can race against during a time trial. Expert Staff Ghosts have to be unlocked by beating the regular Staff Ghost data for each track. Staff Ghosts have "Nin★" next to their names.


Select Single Player from the main menu. Select Time Trials.;
, You will need to race at the top of your game, so pick a character and cart your are comfortable with.
 You will need to beat at least eight courses, so pick courses you know well. This will save you a lot of frustration.
 After selecting the course, you will be able to choose which replay data you want to use. Pick the one that says "Nin★" next to the name.
 The race will start and you will see the ghost on the track with you. You will need to beat the ghost by around 7 seconds to unlock the Expert Ghost. The number of seconds required seems to vary from ghost to ghost, so always try to put as much space between it as possible.


You will see a message at the bottom of your screen after the race informing you that "A fast staff ghost has appeared!"
You will not need to beat the Expert Ghost, simply unlock it.
Repeat until you've unlocked eight Expert Staff Ghosts. Beat the regular Staff Ghost on eight different courses to unlock eight Expert Staff Ghosts.
 Quit the game, then go back to the Main Menu, onto the Select Player screen.
 Finished! You'll see a message saying "Congratulations! You have unlocked Baby Luigi!"

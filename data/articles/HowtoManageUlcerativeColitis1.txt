 While scientists do not understand what causes UC, this disease appears to have a genetic disposition that may be triggered by factors in our environment. Think of UC as being like hay fever. If you have hay fever, you have a genetic disposition that will cause you to develop itchy eyes and a runny nose if exposed to pollen. If you’re never exposed to pollen, you’ll never develop the symptoms. If you are, you will. You certainly didn’t cause the pollen, or the genetic disposition! The same principle applies to UC., Some people will go months or even years without suffering any symptoms of UC. Proper treatment will extend these periods of remission. Only five to 10 percent of UC patients experience UC symptoms all the time, and fortunately even acute sufferers have treatment options., You’ll likely spend most of your life in remission. Properly treated, this is not a life-threatening illness. You can expect to enjoy relationships, marriage, children, a career, and other joys of life.

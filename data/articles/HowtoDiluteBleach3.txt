 Mix one teaspoon (5 ml) into ¼ cup (59 ml) of water. Apply one drop of the solution to a hidden spot on the fabric. Wait for one minute and then blot the spot dry with a white cloth. If the color does not bleed or fade, it should be safe to use bleach on it.Choose a hem for shirts you tuck in and an inseam or spot around the waist on pants.
It’s also smart to check the tags on clothes. There will be a warning if the clothes are sensitive to bleach.
 Remember when you add bleach to your laundry not to let the bleach come into direct contact with the laundry. To accomplish this, start the washer before you put any laundry into it. Let the basin fill at least halfway before you add detergent and bleach., Bleach does not wash clothes, so you still need to use detergent to clean your laundry. If your machine has a detergent compartment, measure out the detergent and add it. If the machine has no detergent compartment, pour it directly into the water., For small loads, use about ½ cup (118 ml) of bleach. If you have an extra large load, it’s okay to use closer to a full cup (237 ml) of bleach. Pour it into a bleach compartment or directly into the water.Washer sizes and load sizes vary, so you’ll have to adjust how much bleach you use.
 Let the washer finish filling with water so that the bleach mixes up and dilutes into the water. When the machine is almost full, put your load of laundry into the water. Make sure it goes all the way into the water rather than floating on top.

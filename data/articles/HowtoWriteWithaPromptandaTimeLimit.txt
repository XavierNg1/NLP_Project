 It may be a word to base the story on, a title, an opening line, or anything. Think about all the possible ways it could be interpreted.


Chances are, you should throw out your first idea, because if it's what you thought of first, it's probably what everyone else thought of first too. Try to think of something that would seem different and original to judges.
Write it at the top of your paper, if it's not already written there. This will keep it in your mind while you think.;
, Sit for a few minutes-but not too long-and think of what to write about. Once you have a general plot worked out, think of details and dialogue to go along with it.


Just because everyone else starts writing immediately doesn't mean you have to. You have a good amount of time to finish and the time you lose thinking of an original plot will probably be made up for in points that others didn't get for stale narratives.
 Writing a short story is like writing a regular story, just quicker. A good narrative should have an introduction, dialogue, rising action, climax, and resolution-just like your favorite book.


Pay attention to the time. A good rule of thumb is that you should be about the the rising action or climax by the time half your limit is up. If not, you should probably write faster.
If you get done early, don't just sit there. Reread your narrative and double check your spelling and punctuation. If you come across an adjective that could be a bit more descriptive, then neatly replace it.
 You've earned the right to do so, and the judges will do the rest. Don't obsess over what you think you may have done wrong, just think about what you did well, and maybe picture yourself going home with a shiny new trophy.

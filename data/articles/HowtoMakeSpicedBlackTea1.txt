 Pour 3/4 cup (180 ml) of water and 1/4 cup (60 ml) of milk into a small saucepan. Turn the heat on to medium and let the liquids warm while you cut the fresh ginger. Slice a small piece of ginger into 2 to 3 thin rounds.If you're using a low-fat milk, use 1/2 cup (120 ml) of milk and 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water.;
, Once the liquid is hot, add the ginger slices and the remaining spices. Keep in mind that you can use all of these spices for a single serving of masala chai or you can use only your favorites. Try adding:2 green cardamom pods
2 to 3 whole black peppercorns
1/4 teaspoon of fennel seeds
1 to 2 pieces of cinnamon

, Continue to heat the chai until it boils. Stir in 2 teaspoons of black tea leaves (or you can use 2 black tea bags). Turn the heat off and steep the tea for 2 minutes.Try using strong black tea, like Assam, Ceylon, or English Breakfast.
 Set a small fine sieve over a mug or tea cup and slowly pour the masala chai through it. This will strain the loose tea and spices. You can discard the solids. Taste the chai and add sugar according to your preference.You can easily double or triple this recipe.

 The guides are the metal rings that hold the line to the rod.

Sand nicks in guide rings to prevent the line from breaking when you have a fish on. If you cannot get the nick out by sanding with fine sandpaper, replace the guide. Examine the guides with a magnifying glass and pass a cotton ball through the rings. Cotton will catch if there is a nick you cannot see with a magnifying glass.



 


Check for rust on the guide rings and the reel seat -- where the reel attaches. If there is rust, replace the guide ring. Sand rust off the reel seat with fine sandpaper and repaint.

, Rods are relatively fragile, and even small nicks or scratches can result in breakage.
 If your rod is soiled, remove the dirt with a soft-bristle brush or a toothbrush. Allow the rod to dry completely before putting it away.


Take extra care to clean your angling rod if you have been fishing in saltwater, as there is a higher chance of corrosion.
 The joints, also known as ferrules, are the places where the separate sections of the rod join.
 Oils in your skin may cause the cork to wear out sooner.


If your cork handle is already worn, wet the rod grip and sand the cork grip with fine, waterproof sandpaper. Then, put some soap on the sandpaper and gently rub the cork. Rinse off the soap and let the grip dry. Be careful not to rub the rod itself with the sandpaper.

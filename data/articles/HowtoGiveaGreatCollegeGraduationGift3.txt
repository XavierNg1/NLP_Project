 Since the graduate is transitioning into a new part of life, they need a new, beautiful journal to mark the occasion and start their adventure. To make the gift more personal, have the journal monogrammed. There are a variety of online stores and retailers, like Etsy and Peter Pauper Press, that provide monogram services., Start the graduation celebration with monogrammed glassware, like wine glasses or beer steins. This gift not only holds a reminder of the graduate’s accomplishments, but it is also a great gift to help them get started on setting up their new kitchen.
 Flasks are staple celebratory gifts, but what makes it a unique gift is a personalized engraving suited to the graduate. Engravings can include their name and date of graduation, or even better, an inspiring quote from their role-model or favorite book.

 If you would prefer to apply in person, or have a specific company that you want to work for, consider going into their office and talking to a representative face-to-face. Doing this can help you to stand out from the sea of faceless online resumes the company receives.


When you go into the office, talk to the receptionist about what positions are available, and if there is anyone you can talk to right away about setting up an interview.
 If you go into an office and ask about available positions, you may be asked to do an interview right then and there. That means that you need to be prepared before hand. Consider your availability so that you can tell them what hours you can work right away.Prepare answers to common interview questions like:


Tell me a little about yourself?
What experience do you have in this field?
Where do you see yourself in five years?
What do you think your strengths are?
What do you think your weaknesses are?
When can you start working and how many hours do you think you could work each week?

, When going for an interview, it is important to wear appropriate clothing. Try to wear ‘business casual’ clothes and avoid clothing and accessories that could be deemed inappropriate.

Girls: Wear a blouse with a knee-length skirt or dress, or wear a nice shirt with slacks and a blazer. Wear nice shoes. If you choose to wear high heels, avoid stilettos.






Guys: Wear a nice polo shirt or dress shirt with slacks and some nice, undamaged shoes. In very formal settings, you should wear a tie and blazer.
 Even if you have not been told which documents to bring, you should bring a folder of important documents with you. That way, you can give a hard copy of your resume to your interviewer that you can refer to during the interview. Bring these documents with you:


Resume or CV.
Cover letter.
List of references.
Professional certificates.
Examples of your work.

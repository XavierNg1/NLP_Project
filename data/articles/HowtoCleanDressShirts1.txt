 Before you can wash your shirt you need to get it ready. Unbutton every button on the shirt, including buttons on collars and cuffs. Then remove the collar stay (if your shirt has one) and put it in a safe place., If there any sweat stains or spots on the shirt, it is a good idea to pre-treat them. You can use a simple fabric spray (such as Shout or Spray-n-Wash). Be sure to spray a bit inside the collar, as well as anywhere else you notice stains., Set your machine machine on "delicate." If the shirt is white or light-colored, set the water temperature to hot. If your shirt is dark-colored, set the temperature to cold to avoid fading., You will want to select a gentle, high-quality laundry detergent, such as Woolite, for your dress shirt. Additionally, you'll want to use approximately half of the recommended amount. Add this to your washing machine., In order to further protect your shirt from snags and other damage during the wash, place your dress shirt inside a laundry bag. Close the bag, place it inside your washer, and start the cycle., Avoid placing your dress shirt in the the dryer. Instead, hang your shirt on a hanger and allow it to air dry. If this is not possible, dry your shirt on your dryer's lowest setting.

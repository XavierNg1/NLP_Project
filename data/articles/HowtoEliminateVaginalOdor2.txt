 It is best to use a mild soap with warm water. Soaps that are too harsh or have too many chemicals and fragrances can actually make your vagina produce more discharge that gives off the foul smell.


Make sure you aren't putting any soap too close to your vagina. You can use soap to clean your pubic hair, but try to keep it away from your vagina. Soap of any kind can throw off the delicate balance of your body.
 Douching can alter the balance of healthy bacteria in your vagina, causing other bacteria to grow and create a foul vaginal odor. You should douche only if asked to by a doctor or gynecologist.
 Yogurt that contains live cultures introduces probiotics (or good bacteria) into your body. This can reverse the problem if you have a mild case or a yeast infection that is just starting out, and acts as a great preventative measure if you start the treatment before the problem develops further.
 Foods such as bread and beer contain yeast, and the sugar in other foods turns into yeast. These foods can increase the amount of yeast in your vagina, causing a yeast infection.
 This can kill your body's natural bacteria. Try taking warm baths or showers to see if it helps reduce your vaginal odor. Doing this step alone will probably not help you, however, so make sure to take a few other suggestions as well.
 You want vaginal discharge to be wicked away from your body, not held close next to it by items like panty liners and pads. Use these only when you need them and absolutely do not use scented products (as these can throw off your body's natural balance).

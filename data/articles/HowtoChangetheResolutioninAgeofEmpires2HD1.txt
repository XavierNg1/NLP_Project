 The game’s resolution is directly mapped to the resolution you’re using for your Windows desktop, meaning that changing your Windows resolution also changes the game’s resolution. To begin, access your computer’s Control Panel.;
, Under “Appearance and Personalization,” click “Adjust Screen Resolution.” On the Resolution drop-down menu, click the resolution you want. This is the resolution both your AoE2HD game and Windows desktop will run in. The best resolution depends on the size of your screen. Here are a few popular screen sizes with their recommended resolutions:


14 CRT (aspect ratio 4:3): 1024x768

14 Notebook / 15.6 Laptop / 18.5 monitor (aspect ratio 16:9): 1366x768

19 monitor (aspect ratio 5:4): 1280x1024

21.5 monitor / 23 monitor / 1080p TV (aspect ratio 16:9): 1920x1080

, When you’ve selected the screen resolution you prefer, just click the “Apply” button at the bottom of the screen to accept the new resolution.
 The usual way to do this is to double-click the game’s icon on the desktop. The game will display in the resolution you set.


You can also change the resolution settings in the Control Panel while playing the game. Just hit the Windows key on your keyboard to minimize the game and open the Start menu. Open the Control Panel, and change the resolution through the Screen Resolution settings page, and then return to the game by clicking the game’s icon on the Taskbar.

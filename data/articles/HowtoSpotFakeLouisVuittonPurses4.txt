 Odds are, if you do not recognize the Louis Vuitton design, it is a fake purse. If you have any doubts, check the bag design through a boutique, in a catalogue or on the official Louis Vuitton website.
 Multicolor, Cherry Blossom, and Cerises designs are not available in all bag styles. Vintage pieces are more likely to be scams.
 Avoid solid colored monograms or monograms with a green tint.

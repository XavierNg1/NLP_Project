 Make sure you are not tuned to a station. You should hear the static tone clearly and steadily. This will allow you to hear any differences in the tone when your device detects a metal object., Turn on your calculator. Next, position the two devices back-to-back, until a steady, dull tone is emitted. You may have to arrange the devices at certain angles or distances to achieve this tone., Once the calculator and radio are producing the correct tone, you need to tape them in that position. If the distance is too awkward to tape your devices together, mount them in that position on a board. This will keep your search head sturdy and functioning properly as you search for metals., An old broomstick or similar pole will make a suitable shaft. Use duct tape as a quick and secure method to mount the shaft. Alternatively, you can use zip ties to fasten the two pieces together. Use whichever method works best for the shape of your search head.., First, prove that the metal detector works by placing a spoon on the table. Run the detector over the spoon and listen for the detector to beep or give off a new sound (different from the steady tone that it is producing). Now, you can take it outside or around your house to locate other metal objects.

 First, place the unworked collar on your kitty and adjust it until it fits properly. A proper fit is tight enough so that kitty can't pull it over her head, but loose enough so that you can still fit two fingers underneath.
 Begin by joining thread with sl st to collar as follows:


Insert hook under collar, and catch slipknot in thread with hook; pull up loop. Then, working over the collar, yarn over and pull a loop through loop on hook; sl st made. The thread is now attached to the collar. Slide the sl st down to one the plastic breakaway clasp.
 Yarn over and draw through both loops on hook; SC made. Continue SC until you completely cover the collar,leaving only the plastic breakaway clasp showing. Finish off.
 Sew the flower in the desired position on the collar. Sew one leaf each side of the flower.

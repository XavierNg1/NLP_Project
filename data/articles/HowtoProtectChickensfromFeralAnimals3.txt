 Cats can help target many predators such as rats and vermin. However, cats may also view chickens as prey. Only use cats as protection if they're comfortable around chickens.New cats and kittens can be introduced to chickens gradually, especially at a young age. Have them interact through a fence or enclosure for a few weeks. Then, try a face-to-face interaction in which the chicken and cat are both restrained.
All cats are different. Some cats will always target chickens as prey, even when properly introduced. If your cat seems aggressive towards chickens, even after controlled interactions, you should not let the cat outdoors near the chickens.
 Farm dogs can be great for protecting chickens. Working breeds like Border Collies will chase off potential predators. However, dogs may sometimes target chickens as well. It's a good idea to keep dogs outside of a chicken coop. If you notice a dog being aggressive towards a chicken, scold the dog in the moment. Eventually, your dog may learn to leave chickens alone., Install a bright security light or a motion activated light near a coop. Bright lights can help deter predators at night when you and your chickens are sleeping. Lights may scare potential predators away from the coop., If your chickens are being targeted frequently by a predator, you can set baited traps. However, traps should only be used in extreme circumstances, as their effectiveness is questionable. Predators like raccoons often travel in groups, so you will have to take out an entire family for traps to be effective. If you do set traps, you will need consistently keep them up for awhile to catch all predators.You should also make sure to release animals like skunks and raccoons far away from other people's homes. You do not want to simply make predators another person's problem.

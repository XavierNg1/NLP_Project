 The first thing you need to do is to add up all of the numbers in the set. Let's say you're working the following set of numbers: 1, 2, 3, and 6. 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.;
, There are 4 distinct numbers in the set. So, take the sum of the numbers, 12, and divide it by 4 to get the average. 12/4 = 3. The average of the group of numbers is 3.
 Use the method of finding the average -- adding up all of the numbers in the set and dividing the result by the amount of numbers -- to find the average of each category. Let's say you're trying to find your weighted average for a class and you're working with the following averages and weight categories:


Homework average = 93%
Test average = 88%
Quiz average = 91 %

, Remember that the weight categories should add up to 100%. Let's say you're working with the following weight categories:


Homework average = 30 % of final grade
Test average = 50 % of final grade
Quiz average = 20 % of final grade

, Now, simply convert each weight category into a decimal and then multiply it by the average it represents. 30% is really .3, or 3/10 of the final grade, 50% is really .5, or 1/2 of the total grade, and 20% is really .2, or 2/10 of the final grade. Now, multiply these decimal-converted weight categories by the averages they represent.


Homework average = 93 x .3 = 27.9
Test average = 88 x .5 = 44
Quiz average = 91 x .2 = 18.2

, To find the final weighted average, simply add up the three results. 27.9 + 44 + 18.2 = 90.1. The final weighted average of the three groups of numbers is 90.1.

 The medianoche ("midnight") has the same filling as the Cubano, but placed on smaller pieces of a sweet, yellow egg bread. If you don't live near a bakery that sells pan suave (or the Mexican version, pan dulce), use challah rolls., In Tampa, Florida, some people make Cuban sandwiches with an Italian flair. Add a layer of Genoa salami between the ham and pork to try it out (but don't tell the sandwich purists in Miami)., Mayonnaise? Tomatoes? Lettuce? Sacrilege according to some, but it's your sandwich. Just give the traditional recipe one try before you bring it into the mainstream of American sandwiches.


The cheese is an easy place to experiment. Try Jarlsberg, provolone, or baby Swiss if you aren't a fan of Emmentaler (the cheese most commonly sold as Swiss in the United States).
 To add a little sear, grill the sandwich open-face for a minute or two, with the ham touching the grill. Do this before adding the pork and pressing as usual.

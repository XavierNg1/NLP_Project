 If you would like to use an image you have downloaded from the Internet or elsewhere, you will have to make sure the image is saved to your gallery.
 If applicable, bring your phone out of its stand-by mode and unlock your lock screen. The default location for your photo gallery is usually your home screen, but if you have rearranged your icons, you might need to swipe to the left or right to find it.
 Simply tap your photo gallery to open the main gallery containing images on your phone.Here you will be able to peruse your image selection and choose your desired image.


If an image does not display in your main gallery, the file type might not be readable by your phone. If this is the case, you may not be able to use that image for your screen saver.
 Though the location of this sometimes changes according to the model of your Samsung phone, but you can usually locate it next to home button below your phone screen., Your lock screen is the first screen you see when you activate your phone from stand-by mode and usually requires you to swipe or input a password to unlock your phone. Your home screen wallpaper is the image in the background of your phone desktop. You can change either or both by selecting one of these options from the list that appeared when you pressed the menu button.
 Now you can crop the image to your liking. You will see a large white box with smaller white manipulator boxes spaced at regular intervals around the larger box. The large box defines the perimeter of your image, and by touching and sliding the small manipulator boxes, you can crop your picture to your preference., When you are through = cropping, you will need to press "Done" before your screen saver is updated. After that, you can return to your home screen or lock screen, where you should see your new image.

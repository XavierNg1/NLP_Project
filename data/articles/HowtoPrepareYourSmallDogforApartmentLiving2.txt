 Your dog will become comfortable in its new home more quickly when it knows what to expect.Develop a schedule for everything, from feeding and walking the dog to outdoor bathroom breaks and playtime. Try to do everything around the same time each day.
 If you live with a partner, roommate, or family member, your dog will feel less anxious about its new home in the apartment if someone is always there during the first few weeks.When one of you is out, the other can stay with the dog. This isn’t always possible due to work schedules and other commitments, but doing it when you can will be comforting to your dog.


It shouldn’t be necessary to continue having someone stay home indefinitely. Once your dog shows signs of feeling at ease in the apartment, try leaving it home alone. You can tell your dog is feeling comfortable when it holds its ears and tail in their natural, relaxed positions when you are getting ready to leave.
Skip this step if you live alone.
 Your dog might be nervous about being in a new home and feel anxious when you’re not there. Even the smallest dog can become too noisy and annoy the neighbors when barking for its owner. To help your pup get used to being without you in the new apartment, step out briefly.Check your mail, chat with a neighbor down the hall, or run a quick errand. As your dog gets used to you being away for short periods of time, it will also be less anxious when you’re gone longer.
 A space where your dog can get cozy, or take a break when needed, will help your dog feel safe and comfortable in its new home.Make the space comfortable by placing familiar items there, such as a favorite toy or blanket. These should be items your dog had in the old home before the move.
You can use your dog’s bed or crate to create a space that is exclusively for your dog.

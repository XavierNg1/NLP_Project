 The tub should fit the gloves in comfortably. This is what we will use to soak the gloves in. The tub doesn't have to be huge, but if that's all you've got, it's fine.;
, Don't ever use cold water or boiling water. A good mix is 1/3 of the tub cold water and 2/3 of the tub very hot water. To test the temperature, stick your hand in the tub. Your hand shouldn't get cold and it shouldn't burn either. It should be about the temperature of a relaxing bath.
 Put only a drop of water to the water. If you don't have any dish soap don't worry about it., Do this for about ten seconds, we're only trying to get the glove nice and wet. If there are clumps of mud on the glove, feel free to get it off now too, you may need to replace the water after though. Take the glove out of the water. It's more effective if you clean one finger at a time.
 You now want to rub the glove whilst under water. Do this finger by finger. Do this with your knuckle or thumb as you can apply lots of pressure to the latex part of the glove. Rub it until all of the mud is off the glove. Then repeat with the other glove., After the cleaning process, your gloves should be dripping wet. The best way for your gloves to dry is naturally but to get all the excess water out, you need to use a towel.


Get one glove and place it in the middle of an old face towel. A bath towel will be far too big. If that's all you have, fold it in half or quarters until it's small enough to work with.
Fold the towel in half with the glove in the middle. It should look like a burger, with the towel being the bun and the glove being the burger.
Walk or jump on top of the gloves, which should be covered with the towel. This should squeeze out and excess water.
 If you don't they might dry out too much (a little bit of moisture is OK) or they might stick.

 Move the baking rack to the bottom third of the oven.
 Cut the squash in half vertically with a serrated knife using a sawing motion. Pry the two halves apart.
 Be sure to scrape out the hallows so that no stringy bits remain. Discard the pulp when you are done, but consider saving the seeds so that you can roast and eat them later.
 Make sure that the cut side is facing up, and the skin side is facing down against the sheet. To keep the squash from scorching or drying out, fill the pan with Â¼-inch (0.64 centimeters) of water.
 Each hallow gets 1 tablespoon of both butter and sugar.You do not need to melt the butter or cut it smaller. It will melt and mix with the sugar on its own.
 The salt will help cut the sweetness of the sugar. It will also help bring out some of the other flavors as well. Be sure to get the salt and cinnamon on both the flat/cut sides as well as the hallows.
 As the squash heats, the butter and sugar will melt together to great a sauce. The squash is done when the edges start to turn golden. You can test it for doneness by poking it with a fork or knife. If you can easily pierce the squash all the way through, it's ready.
 You can eat it straight from the skin, or you can scoop the flesh out with a spoon and serve it in a bowl. If you do that, be sure to mix in the melted sugar-butter!

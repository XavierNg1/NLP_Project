Black + a few drops of White = Greyish Black
Black + Red = Burgundy Black
Black + Blue = Bluish Black
Black + Silver = Metallic Black

, Once you have decided on the shade of black nail polish that you want to create, you can mix your black nail polish with the second color you have chosen. Try adding a just a few drops of the second color at first and then add more until you achieve your desired shade.








Use a popsicle stick or cuticle stick to stir the nail polish colors together.

Make sure that the nail polish bottle is clean or the leftover polish may alter your custom color.

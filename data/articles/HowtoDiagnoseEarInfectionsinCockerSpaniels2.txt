 Since you own a Cocker Spaniel, you should check her ear flaps at least once a day so you can pick out debris, such as twigs or grass seeds, that has become entangled in the long fur. Regularly check the ear for infection. To do this, lift the ear flap and check for skin redness, excessive wax, or discharge from the ear. Sniff each ear to see if they smell bad, which could indicate an infection.If you have doubt about whether your dog’s ear looks normal or not, compare one ear with the other. Often ear one side is worse than the other when there is an infection.
 If you think your Cocker Spaniel has an ear infection, take her to the vet immediately. The vet will perform a physical examination, looking to see if the dog has a head tilt, if there is pain around the ear, if there is a discharge, or physical changes in the ear. The vet will inspect the ear canal for inflammation, redness, ulcers, discharge, or foreign bodies in the ear, such as a grass awn.The vet uses an otoscope to look down the external ear canal. The otoscope fits down the ear canal and allows the vet to look deep into the ear for infections.
If a discharge is present and the ear is sore, this is enough to diagnose an ear infection.
 Your vet will decide the cause of your dog’s ear infection, such as bacteria, yeast, or something else. This will determine how your dog is treated. Your vet will clean your dog’s ear.Most of the time, the vet will start with a topical ear drops in the office, which contain medications against yeast, bacteria, or ear mites. Then, your vet will give you an antibiotic, antifungal, or other medicine to administer at home.If the dog has regular ear infections, or the infection is slow to respond, the vet may perform further tests. These include examining discharge smears under a microscope or sending a swab away for culture.

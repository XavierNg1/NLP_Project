 If you learn the widely available brands that offer gluten-free products, there is no need to pay for select gluten-free brands or specialty foods at gluten-free stores.


Many major manufacturers offer gluten-free products, such as potato chips, canned vegetables or fish, frozen dinners, and desserts.
Buying products that just happen to be gluten-free will usually cost less than buying foods produced specifically to provide gluten-free options to a desperate diet niche.
 Other gluten-free dieters can be your best hope for quickly identifying affordable gluten-free foods available in virtually every grocery store. Some websites keep running tallies of name brand foods that are gluten-free.

 Peppermint products have long been used as a natural remedy for gas. Look for peppermint caps that are enteric coated, which means they can pass through your stomach and into your intestines before dissolving. This will give you a dose of peppermint where it is most needed.


You can also make tea from peppermint leaves to soothe your digestive tract., These products are safe to use during pregnancy, though it is still a good idea to check in with your doctor to ensure they're a good choice for your medical needs. Only turn to over-the-counter medications if dietary changes have failed to make a substantial difference in your symptoms., Contact your doctor immediately if your gas symptoms move beyond discomfort into the realm of actual pain, or if you notice severe diarrhea or blood in your stool.

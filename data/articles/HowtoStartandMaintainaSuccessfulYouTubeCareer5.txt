 YouTube can be a great place but can also be a very demoralizing and nasty place when the haters get involved. No matter what you do, no matter what you look like, there are people out there who will say negative things to try to make their lackluster little lives more interesting as they hide behind the shield of not being seen. The best thing to do when receiving a nasty comment is to delete their comment, block the commenter and never respond to them. You don't want to give them the satisfaction for being an idiot. Keep your head held high and don't let anybody bring you down.


Decide whether you'll even leave a video open to commenting. It's not always the right thing to give people air space to trivialize or downgrade your hard work.
Don't take any of the snarly, self-centered comments personally. Some people really get enthused about being creepy and picky online. Don't give them the time of day. Civility is the byword.
Whenever anyone starts up on the "freedom of speech" spiel, gently remind them that they're already exercising it. It's become a standard bore to read this baseless whine in nasty criticism.
Focus more on the positive comments rather than the negative ones.

 The Spartans weren't actually bare chested (as in in 300). They wore bronze muscular armor or linothorax. Making the linothorax is probably the easiest if you're going to make your own. Hiring is probably the best option if you don't know how to make the armor.


Wear leather underpants. If you don't have any, paint one pair of undies brown (no boxers, only briefs).;
, To make one:


Heat a piece of bronze and hammer a helmet with an exposed face. Forge a face guard (or buy one).
Attach the face guard to your helmet.
 You can also make one out of tin foil and paint it bronze.
 When you wear it, use a fancy metallic brooch to pin the cape with.
 It doesn't matter what kind as long as they're leather.
 You can either forge bronze or use cardboard and plate it with tinfoil, then paint. Remember that Spartan shields were round and had an upside down "V" on the bottom. If you're not sure, search online for some images to guide you.
 If you are going around with a sword, also have a belt and sheath/small loop. The spartan sword is small, like 25 inches (63.5 cm). For more details, see How to make a wooden sword.
 Greaves protect the tibia against attack. Again, you could make your own bronze greaves if you know how to forge metal. Alternatively, make them out of foil and color.
 Swords were more of a secondary weapon, just in case the spear broke or got lost. The spear is the easiest to make: Buy a wooden stick around 75 inches (190.5 cm) long. Sharpen one end.

If you don't have enough time, this is another way to make a more "nooby" spear: chuck-does-art.blogspot.com.es/2011/10/diy-spartan-hoplite-costume-how-to-make.html.
 If this isn't possible, wear a fake one or draw one on cardboard and tape it on your chest.

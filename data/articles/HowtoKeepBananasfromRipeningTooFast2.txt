 You can thaw the bananas for use at a later date.

Although peeled bananas have no protection against air exposure, the airtight sealing acts to limit the amount of fresh air that the bananas get. The freezing temperature will slow down the ethylene emission more than simply refrigerating it.






Unlike refrigerated bananas, frozen bananas will not be edible immediately. You will need to leave bananas at room temperature for about an hour to allow them to thaw.
 The acid coating acts as a preserving agent and keeps the banana yellow longer.


You do not need to saturate the banana in lemon juice. Adding more lemon does not equal better preservation. Adding to much will make your banana taste sour.
For sweeter alternatives, replace lemon juice with pineapple, orange, or apple juice. These are all acidic enough to slow the browning process without needing to be diluted. Apple juice is also mild enough to be nearly undetectable; opt for the other juices if you plan on later mixing the banana with other fruit.
 This also uses acidity to preserve the banana but uses vinegar instead of fruit juice.


Using vinegar is a nice alternative if other fruit juices are distorting the taste too much. Simply add Â¼ cup of vinegar for every cup of water. Dip the banana, sliced or whole, into the water for about three minutes.
Avoid leaving bananas in the vinegar water solution for longer than three minutes. Submerging the banana can cause it to become too soft and can impart a strong vinegary taste, which is likely less appetizing than lemon or lime juice.



Crush a single vitamin C tablet with a spoon and sprinkle it in a glass of water. Stir the solution with a spoon and dip your bananas in the water for a few seconds.






Effervescent vitamin C tablets work especially well for this. Put one tablet in a glass of water. Once the effervescing stops, skip stirring and dip your bananas in the water immediately for a few seconds.

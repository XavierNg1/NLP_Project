 Although peas typically want full sun, which is defined as at least 6 hours of sunlight per day, they also prefer cooler climates. If you live in a hot area, plant your peas in an area that either gets dappled sunlight throughout the day or is shaded during the hottest hours. (A spot partially shaded by a tree or hedge is ideal because the growing leaves will provide more shade as the season gets hotter.)



Make a sun chart to determine which parts of your yard or patio will be suitable for growing peas.
 Each will have different light, space, planting, and harvesting requirements, not to mention a different flavor. Moreover, some grow tall and must be grown up a support system (which can be a great way to utilize vertical space), while others are more compact (and wonâ€™t cast a long shadow across other areas of the garden). There are three general categories of peas:


English (a.k.a. garden) peas are grown only for their seeds and must be shelled after being harvested. There are both high- and low-growing varieties.Snow (a.k.a. sugar) peas are grown for both their sweet, flat pods and their seeds. No shelling is necessary, as they are completely edible, but they taste the best when picked young. There are both high- and low-growing varieties.Sugar snap peas are also grown for both their seeds and pods but are thicker than snow peas and more closely resemble snap beans. They only come in high-climbing varieties.

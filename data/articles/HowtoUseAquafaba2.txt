 Add the simple syrup, lemon juice, bourbon, and aquafaba to a cocktail shaker. Leave the ice out for right now, since this inhibits foaming. Cap and shake it vigorously for about 10 to 12 seconds. Be sure to keep the shaker vertical to prevent leaks, since ice is what usually keeps a slanted shaker from leaking, thanks to the vacuum that the cold creates.Simple syrup is simply equal parts sugar and water.
 Uncap your shaker. Add a cube or two of ice. Cover the shaker again and shake for another 10 to 15 seconds., Uncap your shaker and slowly pour the liquid from as high as you can into the shaker’s top half or a tall glass (depending on what type of shaker you have). Allow the liquid to travel through as much air as possible so more air combines with it, which will make your foam that much foamier. Remove the ice from the shaker after the first pour, then repeat back and forth two or three more times., Depending on what type of shaker you have, either attach its strainer if it has an attachable one or, if it doesn’t, hold a strainer over your serving glass. Slowly pour the liquid through the strainer into the glass. Add a dash or two of Angostura bitters to taste, then serve.

 Like the actual console, the wires need to properly connected. Make sure that your controller is plugged into slot number 1. Also, push it in all the way. It might not be working because the wires are not pushed in fully. Make sure they are before continuing to the next steps.
 If the wires look bent or used, they might be broken inside. While you won't be able to check the inside of the wires, you can still look for evidence on the outside of the cover. Evidence of a broken wire includes broken, chewed up or cracked casing. The part where the wire goes into the control is most vulnerable to breaking.
 It's very easy for dust and grime to clog up your console's controller slots. This might stop the wires from sending the correct signals to the PlayStation. To fix this, gently clean out the controller slots with a cloth wrapped around your index finger. Also clean the wires connected to the controller. These too might be clogged up with dirt and dust.

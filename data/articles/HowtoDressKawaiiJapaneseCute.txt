 This is about being mega cute, colorful but sweet and not too noisy. Draw manga and anime, perhaps by watching some YouTube videos about it. Discuss Japanese culture and clothing with your friends to shape your own views. Play Dance Dance and maybe some calligraphy, and write messages with love, peace symbols in Japanese to friends. There are many ways to form your style.;
, Try to dress colourfully, see cute anime colorful pictures, they'll get you in the mood. Rainbows, polka dots, stripes, peace signs, happy faces, cute animals... casual but colorful. Try out some oriental clothing in alternative clothing stores, and don't be afraid to try something bold. Shirts with cute graphics paired with a colorful tutu or some dungarees are very cutesy and suit this look perfectly. If you don't want to spend too much money, you can always try investing in things like socks, tights, headbands or even wigs if you are into that.
 Spikes, accessories and slick hair is what's "it" in kawaii style. Get some gel and work your hair into a manga or anime inspired hairdo. While bangs are not necessarily, they still fit really well into the look. Then a simple headband with or some colorful clips from the kid section of a clothing store will do.

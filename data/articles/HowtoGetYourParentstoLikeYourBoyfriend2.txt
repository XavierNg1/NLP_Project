 Before introducing your boyfriend to your family, provide him with your family’s possible expectations. By prepping your boyfriend for certain behaviors and questions, then he may feel less overwhelmed and more at ease. Avoid blindsiding your boyfriend about how your parents may act. Provide him with reassurance.
Teach him ways to win your parents over. Good manners in particular will help.
Consider asking him to dress up for the first meeting with your parents.
Tell your boyfriend to avoid cursing or crude language that could bother your parents.
Tell your boyfriend what to call your parents, such as Mr. and Mrs. Smith or by their first names if less formal.
 When you and your boyfriend meet up with your parents, make the settings less awkward or uncomfortable. Find ways for your boyfriend to meet your parents well before a big family gathering or a holiday dinner. Make the interactions seem natural between your boyfriend and your parents, rather than awkward, big events.Have opportunities for you and your boyfriend to meet your parents at home or at a family dinner on a Sunday night.
Consider having your parents meet you and your boyfriend at a neutral place like a shopping mall or a restaurant.
The interactions between your boyfriend and your parents don’t have to be long, but should help to put both sides more at ease.
 Just like when you meet new people. You’re more likely to enjoy being with someone who has common interests. Figure out ways to connect the hobbies, interests, and personalities of your parents to your boyfriend.


For example, let’s say that your boyfriend is soccer sports fan and watches other sports. Maybe your parents are devoted sports fans. Even if they aren’t fans of the same team or sport, there may be things that they can talk about.
Or let’s say that your boyfriend plays a musical instrument, and your parents love jazz, you could see if your boyfriend could play a song that they enjoy.

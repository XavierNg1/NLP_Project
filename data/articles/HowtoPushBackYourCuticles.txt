 It shouldn't be too hot, or too cold. Soaking your nails in warm water makes the cuticles soft and pliable. When you push them back, they'll lift easily from your nails instead of sticking. You can also push them back after taking a warm shower, while your hands are still warm and moist.

, Enjoy the soaking time as part of your manicure session. Add a few drops of essential oil to the water to get the benefits of aromatherapy as you soak your nails. Don't be in a rush - you want those cuticles to get nice and soft.
 Use a clean towel to dry off your fingers, so the cuticle pusher doesn't slip when you start to do the job.
 Vaseline works too. Rub it in a little, but not completely. For a truly expert touch, use cuticle remover, available for purchase at drugstores.
 Angle the orange stick so that you gently push the cuticles toward the base of your nails, a little at a time. Don't push too hard or scrape your nails. If you're having trouble pushing the cuticles back, soak them for awhile longer to soften them up.









Never attempt to trim or tear off your cuticles. They are there to protect your fingers from getting infected. A tear could allow bacteria to enter your nail beds.
If you're ever getting a manicure at a salon, and the manicurist starts trimming your cuticles, tell her to stop right away. Many women have had to go to the doctor to get infected fingers treated after manicures gone wrong.
 Take a look at your cuticles: they should be fully pushed back, revealing the base of your nails. Do a touch-up if you see cuticles that still need to be pushed back.
 You should also moisturize your cuticles frequently to keep them soft and in good condition.
 Don't bite your nails or use harsh chemicals on your fingers, like acetone-based nail polish remover. These habits will cause your cuticles to get dry and cracked, and could lead to an infection.

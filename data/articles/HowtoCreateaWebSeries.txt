 Try to keep it organized, and keep it true to the audience that you are gearing it towards. For example, if you are making a business video, try not to drench it in jokes.;
, You will need actors and actresses. If your series is animated and you can't find anybody else to help you, many recording programs come with voice editing filters. If you are doing this, I would recommend using Audacity.
 There are a number of ways to do this. The most popular method is to either draw clips on paper and use a scanner, or just do the clips on paint. If your series is live action, film your video using any video camera.
 If your series is animated, display your clips very fast unless there are some still frames. If it was filmed using a camera, just put the clips together normally. I would use Windows Movie Maker, but you can use whatever program you want.
 If the video is animated, make sure that you do a good job with lip-sync.
 Make sure it is under 15 minutes and is completely finished.

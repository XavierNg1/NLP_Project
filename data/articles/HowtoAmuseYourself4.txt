 By spreading yourself out to the area you live in, you do many things. For one, you spend time doing good and helping people, animals, and the community. You're also giving yourself a positive reputation. If you suddenly are in need of a new job or have decided to run for mayor, you're more likely to be trusted when you have a reputation for helping other people., While you have extra time on your hands, there may be people in your life that can't seem to find enough time in the day. Ask your parents if they need help around the house. See if your siblings could use your help with homework. By volunteering your time, you are not only doing a good deed, you are also providing much needed relief to someone you care about.Ask your parents you they need you to babysit for one of your siblings so they can run errands. This is always a nice gesture.
 See if your friends could use help studying or preparing for something they have going on in their life. They will be grateful for your help, and you may have fun in the process.

 Before you begin styling your hair, use shampoo and conditioner to wash it thoroughly.


Use a wide-toothed comb to get out any tangles while it’s still wet.
Be careful not to tear your hair as you comb it.
 You want it to be about 90% dry when you put it up. It should be damp, not wet.


If you already prepped your curly hair by straightening it, you can simply dampen your hair slightly rather than washing it again.
 Use your fingers to work a gel or mousse into your hair while it’s damp.


This will give your air-dry style more hold and definition. It will also combat frizz.
 It’s all right if you have some bumps in your hair, as Serena’s finished style is casual.
 To do this, grab the end of your pony, and twist it tightly. Once you have created a hair rope, twist this around the base of your ponytail.


Tuck the end of ponytail into the elastic.
Use bobby pins to secure the sides of the bun
If you don't want to use elastic, as this can cause breakage in fine hair, use spiral bobby pins or large plastic clips to secure your bun. It doesn't need to be extremely tight.
 If you have shorter hair framing your face, pin it back behind your ears with bobby pins. This will help it to dry to look natural and swept back.
 Your hair will set and dry as you sleep.
 In the morning, when your hair is dry, take out your bobby pins, and let your hair loose.


Run your fingers through your hair to break up your waves.
If you want, set your finished Serena style with hairspray.

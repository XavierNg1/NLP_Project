 Trimming your tree during the winter months allows it to care for its wounds in spring when it will recover more quickly.Limit trimming only to dead or broken branches on newly planted trees.
Two to three years after planting you can begin developmental trimming to shape the tree.
Learn the growth habits of your particular type of oak tree;
, To create a healthy oak tree that create beautiful shade, you need to develop one dominant branch on the tree. Look at your tree and notice the largest branches. There maybe 2 or even 3 branches that are all large and a similar size to each other. As the tree grows, these will turn into multiple leaders and create a weaker tree.


Decide which branch looks like it is the most vertical and centered on the trunk and choose that one to be the dominant leader.Trim the other branches that may turn into other leaders by reducing their size to allow more sunlight to reach the dominant leader you chose.
Keep the dominant leader long.
 The branch collar is the swelling at the base of the branch where it begins to connect to the trunk. Trimming branches down to the branch collar will hurt the main trunk of the tree causing it damage to important tissues necessary for growth.









Shorten large branches by cutting them back to a lateral branch or bud.
Always make angled cuts to encourage growth

, Never remove more that one third of the treeâ€™s canopy in a single season. The tree depends on a healthy crown to create food from the sunlight and grow healthy roots in the ground. This is especially important when the tree is young., You need to prune young trees yearly to keep them growing healthily. Make sure the dominant leader is always the largest branch and trim back any large splits. Trim the branches that will prevent your tree from growing how you want it to:Dead, diseased, or broken branches
Branches that cross over or rub other branches
Inward growing branches
Branches that are growing directly on top of other branches

Apple will ask you for personal information in order to open an account. Be prepared with your date of birth and an email address. You will also need to create a password and set up your security questions to continue.
 Using the id you have just created or an already existing account (if you have one), sign in if you aren't already. If your music library appears when you open iTunes, you're already signed in to your account.


If the iTunes store appears when you open iTunes, the account email address is in the upper left hand area of the gray tab at the top in the "iTunes Store" area. Make sure this is your account email address.

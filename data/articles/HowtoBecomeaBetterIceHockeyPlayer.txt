 You need to know the basic structure of the game, such as the penalties and how to score a goal in hockey.;
, This is the key component to ice hockey unless you are a goalie. Search online and ask your coach for drills that will improve your skating. Check at your local ice rink for open skate sessions, or better yet, open hockey sessions where you can put on full pads and skate like you would in a game.
 It doesn't look or feel very good to fall down. Practice skating with a puck, and slowly start to carry the puck without looking down. This helps your balance.
 Get someone to practice with you. Practice passing the puck without it coming off of the ice. If you're a beginner, you don't need to worry about your passes being hard, you just need to worry about making accurate, tape-to-tape passes.
 There are three types of shots in hockey. Beginners only need to worry about taking a wrist shot:


Start with the puck on the heel of your stick, and your stick slightly behind you and extended from your body. Position your hands at the top and a bit higher than halfway on your stick.
Bend your knees slightly, and bring the stick forward. The puck should roll off your stick, giving it spin.
Follow through with your knees still slightly bent and point at where you would like the puck to go with your stick.

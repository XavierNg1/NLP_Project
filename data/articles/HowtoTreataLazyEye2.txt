 Surgery may be performed on the eye muscles to straighten the eyes if non-surgical means are unsuccessful. Surgery can also help in the treatment of amblyopia if the condition is caused by a cataract.Surgery may be accompanied with the use of an eye patch, eye medication, or glasses, or, if it produces good results, may be sufficient on its own.
 Eye exercises may be recommended either before or after surgery to correct faulty visual habits and to teach normal, comfortable use of the eyes.


Because amblyopia often comes hand-in-hand with weakened eye muscles on the "bad side," it can take strengthening exercises to get your eye muscles even on both sides again.
 Ensuring that you follow-up with your doctor according to the schedule of eye exams that they recommend will help you to avoid this problem.

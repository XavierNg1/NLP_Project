 An alkyne is a hydrocarbon chain that contains one or more triple bonds between carbons. The suffix at the end of an alkyne should always be -yne.
, The parent chain of an alkyne must contain any carbons that are triple-bonded. Number it from the end nearest to a triple-bonded carbon.


If you're dealing with a molecule that has both double and triple bonds, start the numbering from the end located closest to any multiple bond.
 In addition to noting where substituents are on an alkyne chain, you must also note where the triple bond is. Do this such that the lowest number on the triple bond is used.


If your molecule contains double bonds as well as triple bonds, you must locate these as well.
 If your parent chain has two triple bonds, the name will end in "-diyne." Three is "-triyne," and so on.
 As with alkanes and alkenes, you must list substituents alphabetically in the final name. Exclude prefixes such as di-, tri- and delta-.


If your molecule contains double bonds as well as triple bonds, the double bonds must be named first.

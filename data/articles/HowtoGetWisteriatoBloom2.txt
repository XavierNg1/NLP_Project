 Using a fertilizer will encourage your wisteria to blossom. You can find phosphate fertilizer from an online retailer, or you can find it in a local or a big box store.
 You should only do this in the early spring, such as April. When you have the fertilizer in your possession, read the instructions on the package and heed any warnings.


If you have plenty of time to fertilize, use a natural fertilizer and apply it to the surface of the soil. This method takes a longer time to release nutrients into the soil.
If you are short on time to fertilize, use a water soluble fertilizer. This is a fluid solution that is dissolved in water and is sprayed onto the soil and the plants.
Many times, when struggling to get a wisteria to bloom, too much nitrogen is the culprit. Adding phosphorus to the soil will balance the nitrogen already present in the soil and will encourage the wisteria to blossom.
 Each spring, you should add compost to the soil around the wisteria. Apply a two-inch covering of mulch on top of the compost. This will retain moisture and deter weeds from growing around the plant.


Wisteria grows best in fertile, moist, well-drained soil.You can make your own compost or purchase compost from a gardening store.
You can also make your own mulch.

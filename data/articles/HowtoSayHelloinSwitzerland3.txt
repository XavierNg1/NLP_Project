 Particularly in the western regions of Switzerland, people should be able to understand you if you speak French to them. Swiss French varies much less dramatically from standard French than does Swiss-German from standard German., This term is the standard, textbook translation of “hello," and you can use it in both formal and casual settings. Bonjour is a combination of the term "bon," meaning "good," and "jour," meaning day. The literal translation is "good day." The word is pronounced "bon-zhoor"., The "t" is silent, so pronounce the word "Sah-loo". This translates to a casual “hi” or “hullo” rather than a formal “hello.”


Even though salut is an interjection used to greet people, it is related to the French verb "saluer," meaning "to greet" or "to salute."
Another informal greeting using this term would be “Salut tout le monde!” Roughly translated, it means “Hello, everybody!” The term "tout" means "all" and "le monde" means "the world." This greeting would only be used amongst a group of close friends.
 Pronounce it "bon-swar". The literal translation of this word is “good evening,” and it should be used to say “hello” in the evening or at night.The term can be used in formal and casual settings, but it is more likely to be heard in formal settings.


"Bon" means "good", and "soir" means "evening".
One way to greet a crowd of people in the evening is to state, "Bonsoir mesdames et messieurs," meaning, "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen." Pronounce it, "bon-swar meh-dahms et meh-sures."

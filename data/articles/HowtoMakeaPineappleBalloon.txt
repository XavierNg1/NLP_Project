Tie a knot in the end of each balloon.
Tie the string around the knot––you’ll be hanging the balloon from this end.;
, Draw the typical leaf shape of a pineapple.


You’ll need at least eight to ten of these leaves, proportioned to the size of the balloon.
 Cut as neatly as possible.
 Ensure that they are standing upright; sometimes this may require some creative taping.
 The leaves face upward, the large round end of the balloon faces downward.


Hang a row of pineapple balloons across a room for a fantastic tropical effect.

 Your parents are there to help you be successful and happy. If you are being teased in middle school, both of these things become harder. Explain the teasing to your parents and ask them what they think you should do. Depending on the severity and the type of teasing, the school may need to get involved as well., If you feel unsafe or think that you need help controlling the teasing at school, talk to one of your teachers about the situation. Alternatively, you could reach out to your guidance counselor for support concerning the teasing. If necessary, your principal may also get involved.Report any type of teasing that is physical or sexual in nature immediately. This includes any hitting, slapping, or shoving, but also includes verbal/written sexual harassment. Tell a teacher that you are comfortable with, or go straight to the principal to report these issues. If they are not taken seriously, you should tell your parents and ask them to help.
 If you are having a particularly hard time dealing with the teasing, and do not feel comfortable opening up to parents or teachers, ask your parents to make you an appointment with a professional counselor. Counselors are trained to listen to you and help you work through your problems. Counselors will also help you build coping skills to manage the stress in your life.

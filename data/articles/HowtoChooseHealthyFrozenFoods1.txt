 Frozen fruits and vegetables can actually be very healthy. In fact, they can be more nutritious than fresh fruits and vegetables because they are frozen immediately after harvesting and their nutrients stay at their peak. To ensure you are buying healthy frozen produce, make sure that the only ingredient listed on the package is the vegetable or fruit.For example, buy 100% corn, or 100% peas. You can also buy 100% frozen strawberries, or mango.;
, Some packages of frozen vegetables and fruits can include additional cheese, sauce, pasta, rice, or sugar. These packages contain more calories and more sodium.For example, a cup of frozen broccoli contains 30 calories, no fat, and 20 milligrams of sodium. The same amount of frozen broccoli with cheese contains double the calories and upwards of 600 milligrams of sodium.
 When you are shopping for frozen produce feel the package and make sure that there is not a large lump or clump of frozen food attached together. This often means that the vegetables or fruit have been thawed and refrozen. When vegetables and fruits are thawed they lose some of their nutritional value., Resealable bags can help prevent freezer burn or ice crystals developing on the produce. This can impact both the taste and nutritional value of the produce.

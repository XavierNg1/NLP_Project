 Hot spices and condiments stimulate the production of gastric acids and can irritate the stomach.
 Both of these foods protect the stomach's mucous membrane because of their mucilage content, a thick, gluey substance produced by some plants.
 Full-fat dairy can generate inflammation and burning in the stomach.


A lot of people consume dairy products in order to counteract stomach acidity, but the relief is only temporary and the symptoms will come back even stronger.
Choose low-fat dairy and moderate your consumption of these products.
 Carrots have natural anti-inflammatory and painkilling properties. Thanks to their high concentration of beta-carotene and fiber, they neutralize excess acid and regulate acidic production. You can eat them raw or cooked; either way, they will help to control your symptoms.
 Even decaffeinated versions of coffee or soft drinks can damage your gastrointestinal membranes, causing gastritis and ulcers.


Replace these drinks with water and natural non-citrus drinks. Custard apple and soursop are capable of repairing and protecting stomach lining.
 These products digest slowly and increase the production of gastric acid.


Make homemade foods with lots of green, leafy vegetables.
Avocado and squash neutralize excess gastric acid while simultaneously protecting and reducing inflammation in the stomach's mucous membrane. Include these vegetables in your recipes.
Incorporate rice into your diet... and use the leftover water! Rice has a natural anti-inflammatory effect on the stomach and the intestines. One home remedy for gastritis is to slow boil a handful of rice. Drink the remaining liquid at least three times per day.
 Honey has a healing effect on gastric ulcers, and it also combats heartburn. Use it to sweeten all of your drinks throughout the day.


You can also add 2 tablespoons of honey to lukewarm water and drink it daily on an empty stomach. You will gradually start to feel better.

 The candle should be an even-burning dinner candle, placed approximately an arm's length in front of you. The flame should be level with your eyes so that you can hold your head steady and gaze straight ahead. To use reflected light, place the candle behind you so that you can see the reflection in a mirror directly in front of you, at proper height.;
,, If you blink very soon after beginning the gaze, ignore it and continue to gaze.Focus all your attention on the flame, ignoring all other thoughts, sensations, and feelings. Keep your gaze steady and unblinking.
 Close your eyes and visualize the flame in the center of your mind as long as you comfortably can. The smaller, clearer and more defined the image of the flame, the better the training for concentration.
 With practice, the image will become clearer and more defined. By internalizing the image, you change the exercise from a concentration exercise(external orientation) to a meditation exercise(internal orientation).

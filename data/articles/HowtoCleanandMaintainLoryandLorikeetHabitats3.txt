 Lory and lorikeets need a large cage to thrive. The cage you get should be at least two feet tall and 24 by 24 inches., When doing a routine cleaning, check all the toys. If toys have broken edges, loose strings, or other damages, throw them away. Replace them with similar toys right away. Most bird toys are not made to last long term and need to be replaced fairly regularly., To minimize the risk of negative reactions to cleaning products, go for natural products. Most pet stores sell organic cleaners and disinfectants that minimize the use of harsh chemicals and artificial ingredients., Due to the tendency of lories and lorikeets to squirt their droppings, place the cage in an area that is easy to clean. Ideally, keep the cage outdoors. If you don't have space for a safe outdoor aviary, place the cage near washable walls, such as tiled walls or walls painted with acrylic paint.

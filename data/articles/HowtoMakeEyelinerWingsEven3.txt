 Most people have an idea about where exactly the wings should extend to on either side, but then they get the eyeliner brush in their hands and that plan goes out the window. Instead, work backwards and place the point of the eyeliner first, before attempting to draw any sort of line., Once you’ve placed dots on either side of your eyes where you want the wings to extend to, look straight ahead in the mirror. Double-check that the dots are symmetrical and at the same distance from the outer corners of the eyes. If the points are symmetrical, the wings will be even., Once you’ve ensured that the dots are evenly placed, you can use your liquid or gel eyeliner to create the wing. Start at the points and move inwards to the outer corners of your eyes. With a defined point already created, the guesswork has been taken care of. Connecting those dots to the corners of your eyes is the easy part!

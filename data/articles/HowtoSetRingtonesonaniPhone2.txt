 There are many sites and apps from which you can download ringtones, but they are often filled with spyware, viruses and copyright-protected music that could get you in trouble. Your safest bet is to use the iTunes store right from your phone. If you’re using another app or site that you’ve researched and trust, the instructions should be similar to those in this method.
 Tap the iTunes icon.
 Tap “More” at the bottom of the screen and select “Tones.” You can now search by genre, top ten lists or featured ringtones.Tap each tone to hear a sample.
 Tap the price of the ringtone to download it to your phone. Once you agree to the purchase, you’ll be asked what you’d like to do.Tap “Set as Default Ringtone” to make your new ringtone the universal sound for all incoming phone calls.
Tap “Assign to a Contact” to choose a person in your contacts list that who you’d like to be associated with this ringtone. This means that every time that person calls you, you’ll hear this new ringtone. All other calls will still use the current ringtone.
Tap “Done” to simply download it without changing your ringtone. If you choose this option and later want to change your ringtone to this file, open the Settings menu and select “Sounds,” then “Ringtone.” You’ll now see this ringtone file as an option. Tap it to set as your ringtone.

 Make a 3:1 mixture by combining 3 tablespoons of baking soda to 1 tablespoon of water. Use a spoon, dull knife or old toothbrush to mix the ingredients together until they form a paste.The paste should have the consistency of toothpaste, so if itâ€™s too runny or thick, adjust it with more baking soda or water. More baking soda will make it thicker, and more water will make it thinner.





;
, Use a cloth or an old toothbrush to apply the paste liberally onto the plastic, making sure to scrub any sticky grime.You may need to make more paste if you are cleaning a large plastic item.
 Allow the baking soda paste to sit on the plastic for 20 to 30 minutes. The baking soda will loosen the dirt on the plastic.
 Use a wet washcloth to wipe the baking soda paste off the plastic. Rinse the washcloth periodically as you wipe.
 Remove the remaining paste by rinsing the plastic thoroughly with clean water. This should rinse away any dirt or grime the paste loosened.


Smaller items can be placed in the sink to be rinsed.
A large item can be rinsed with a garden hose.
 Use a mild dish detergent to wash the plastic.

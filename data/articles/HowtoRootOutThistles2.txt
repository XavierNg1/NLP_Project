 At this stage it's easy to pull the baby thistle plants before they mature into spiky grown-ups. Even at this young stage of growth the weed seedlings do possess prickles so wear gloves.
 Make sure you use good garden gloves as the bristles are sharp. When the thistle is sighted cut the flowering stem to the ground and do not put it in the compost pile as the plant may have hidden seeds which could infect the compost.


Dig the long root deeply as you can. The root only lives one to three years provided there is no second stem with leaves that could regrow. The plant roots in the soil will die.
 The herbicide may or may not work on older plants as they are at times very resistant to herbicide chemicals. Glyphosate is shown to work with bull thistle effectively but also kills surrounding plants as well. For annual thistle plants in areas close to desired plants use a selective herbicide that only works on weeds such as thistle. Make note however many herbicides work on growing plants and not seeds.
 Seeds mostly can lie dormant (sleep) in the ground for twenty years or more, their seeds can germinate at anytime of the year and sprout unexpectedly surprising a gardener. In some states in the US the bull thistle has created thorny dense stands that go one for miles.

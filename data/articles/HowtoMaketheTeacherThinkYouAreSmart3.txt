 Do your best to show up for school or class early. While everyone gets sick sometimes and needs to stay home, try to miss as little school as possible.Getting to class before other students will also help your teacher notice you more.
 Do your best to get along with your classmates. If someone is having trouble understanding something, raise your hand and try to explain the material in a way that might help the other student. When you’re assigned group projects, avoid slacking off and leaving most of the work to other students.You teacher will think you’re really smart if you show them that you want others to learn, too.
 Do your best to be genuine about wanting to learn instead of wanting to simply appear to be smart. Try to be more concerned with actually learning about a class session's topic than with just showing off how smart you are. Be sincere, positive, and enthusiastic instead of trying to suck up or be a know it all.Try not to raise your hand and rephrase what the teacher just said or bring up an unrelated subject just because you know a lot about it. For example, if your teacher mentions that the Boston Tea Party happened in 1773 and you know an unrelated event that also happened that year, it's probably not helpful to raise your hand and tell the class about the other event just to sound smart.
Be sure to remember who the teacher is, and avoid acting like a know it all by giving the teacher constant corrections.
 If you show a little appreciation, your teacher will not only like you but know that you care about the value of education. Again, try not to be a suck up or insincere. Think of ways that you’ve learned from your teacher, and try to be brief but specific.


For example, you might say, “It was really cool to learn about the Boston Tea Party, and I wanted to thank you for teaching us about it. I used to think it was literally a tea party! Now I understand that it was an important symbolic protest and involved so many complicated factors.”

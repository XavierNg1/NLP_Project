 This activates a window that magnifies the area you've tapped and causes a flashing cursor to appear.


If you'd like the cursor in a different location, just drag your finger over the text until it's in the location you'd like it to be.;
, A menu of buttons will pop up, and blue left and right control points will appear on either side of the highlighted text.
 Doing so highlights the word in which the cursor is flashing.


Tap Select All if you'd like to highlight all the text on the page.
Use Look Up to find the definition of a word.
 Use the control points to drag the highlight over the text you wish to copy.
 The buttons will disappear, and the highlighted text has been copied to your device's clipboard.
 Locate the place where you'd like to paste the text, whether in a different part of the current document, a new document, or a different app, and tap it with your finger.
 This button will appear above the place where you tapped. The text you copied will be inserted.


The "Paste" option will not appear unless there is something stored in your device's clipboard from a "Copy" or "Cut" command.
You can't paste into un-editable documents, like most web pages.

 The oven is a default we often resort to when keeping something warm. On the other hand, ovens are notorious for drying out mashed potatoes. There are ways of preventing this from happening. It merely depends on what tools you strap your potatoes with before sending them into the oven.
 Gentle steam retains the moisture of mashed potatoes. You’ll need two bowls where one is large enough to store your bowl of finished potatoes. Make sure you can fit the bowl of mashed potatoes inside the larger bowl with latter’s lid attached.


Make sure the bowls are oven safe before continuing., Heat up about a cup of water in either the microwave or on the stove-top. Once the water is heated, transfer it into the large bowl. Fit the small bowl inside to ensure the water doesn’t overflow., Once you’ve prepared the two bowls, place them in the oven set to 200 degrees Fahrenheit. You can use a lower temperature if you prefer, but nothing under 150 degrees. This technique will only work for about an hour.Check on the potatoes after thirty minutes to ensure the process is working.
 Once you take the potatoes out of the oven, whisk them with a fork. If you still need to keep the potatoes warm, cover the potatoes with a warm, damp washcloth.


The washcloth will buy you another twenty minutes. Make sure it is clean before using on your food.

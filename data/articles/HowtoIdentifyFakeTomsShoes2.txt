 The insoles of TOMS shoes should be sewn in, and should not come out easily. In addition, the insole may not match the inside contours of fake TOMS shoes., If the insoles are flat and do not contain mounds to support the arches of your feet, the TOMS shoes are most likely fake., Counterfeit shoes are generally not as well made as the genuine article. One way to evaluate this is to look at the stitching. Do you notice any uneven stitching or threads that are coming lose? If so, the shoes are probably fakes., Ensure that the size printed on the inside of the shoe matches with the actual size of the shoe. For example, if you are a women's size 7, but the shoes you try on in your size are far too large or fit a woman who wears a size 8, the shoes are probably fake.

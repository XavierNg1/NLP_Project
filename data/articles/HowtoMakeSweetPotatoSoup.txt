,,,, Add water to about one inch over the vegetables. Bring to a boil and simmer until all vegetables are soft. You can also pre-bake your sweet potatoes before slicing and adding to the pot for this step for easier pureeing later.
 Use stick blender to puree all the vegetables together. If desired, add a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, or curry. Don't add the salt until after you have used the chicken or vegetable stock.
 Add enough chicken or vegetable stock to thin out the puree to desired soup consistency. Taste your product at this point and add salt if needed and pepper to taste, or another pinch of spice if needed. You may add a splash of heavy cream at this point to give it a creamier appearance. Heat to serving temperature without boiling.
 Top with a dollop of sour cream if desired, it does add a depth to the soup, and if you have added a bit too much curry or any other spice, it will help to calm the heat a bit.

 Wear your track pants and sports top. Nike or Adidas tops look the best, they are sweat absorbing and also keep you warm or cold. If you are on a team, wear the clubs team jersey or colours.;
, Heels, seriously? Definite no-no for sports. Wear trainers, tennis shoes, astro-boots (They are grippy and ensure you don't slip) or football boots (don't wear if you're playing inside).
 Yes, it may be they latest fashion to have your shoes coming off every five minutes but be sure to tie them for sport. Want to go to prom with your head split open and your leg in a cast?

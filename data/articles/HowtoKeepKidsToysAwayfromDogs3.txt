 When your dog is busy with its own toys, it may be less likely to take your kids’ toys. Many types of toys are available for dogs, such as puzzle toys, chew toys, soft plush toys, and nylon bones.You could even turn dirty laundry (pillowcases, t-shirts, towel) into toys, since your dog would enjoy smelling your scent on the item.Interactive toys, such as a rope toys, could also be a good toy type for your dog.Interactive toys would allow you and your dog to spend quality time together.
If your dog is particularly destructive, choose toys that are durable, such as nylon bones.
Do not choose toys that have easily removable parts, like string or plastic eyes. Your dog could swallow these parts, causing a potentially serious medical problem., Even if your dog has a basket full of toys, it may get bored with them if they’re out all the time. To keep your dog interested in the toys, leave out only a few at a time and rotate them about once a week. If your dog has a favorite toy, though, consider leaving that one out all the time.Replace toys when they are worn and damaged.
 If you have young kids, they may not understand that they should not grab your dog’s toys.Explain to your kids they should not grab the dog’s toys, just like the dog should not grab their toys.

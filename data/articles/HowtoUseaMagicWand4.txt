 The wand does not need to touch the area, but it should be pointed away from you and toward the target area. You might make circular motions with the wand and incorporate a prayer, mantra, or incantation.These might include:


Meditations or visualizations that ground or focus you.
Invocations of a god, goddess, or nature spirit.
Prayers about nature and natural subject matter, including seasonal prayers and incantations during a full moon.
 Since wands transmit energy, they improve energy flow through the body. This can be applied to breaking down blockages in a variety of systems, such as the circulatory and nervous systems. Clear away blockages by pointing the wand at the blocked area or areas, and focusing your energy and any verbal prayers or mantras that you might like to use.
 In this case, you would point the wand toward yourself. Meditate on the negative thoughts and feelings, and allow the wand to draw them out. You might speak your wishes at this point as well. Reduce stress and nervousness. Wands help clear blocked pathways that help release stress, nervousness, and other negative energy., Many people do this while lying down. Run the wand over your body and focus on when and where the wand vibrates. These areas require more attention from the wand. Once the wand stops vibrating, your auras are cleansed.

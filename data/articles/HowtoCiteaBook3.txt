 The APA (American Psychological Association) requires book citations to occur in both places. For example, if you were citing the book, The Epic of America, you would reference it within your text with the title (italicized) and the year of publication: The Epic of America, (1931). You would also properly cite the book on your reference page with the specific formatting rules for citing authors, editors and books:

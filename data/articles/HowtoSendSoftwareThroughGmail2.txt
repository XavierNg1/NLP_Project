 If the file is small enough to send through Gmail (less than 25 MB, 10 MB if the recipient is not using Gmail), you can use this method to bypass the file type filter. It still may be easier to use Google Drive, but this works if you can't access it.


Your recipient will need to know how to fix the file name so that the program can be ran.
, If you can't see the file extension (.exe, .bat, etc.) for the files on your computer, you'll need to enable them so that you can make the required changes.


Windows 7, Vista, XP - Open the Control Panel, select "Appearance and Personalization", and then click "Folder Options". Click the View tab and uncheck "Hide extensions for known file types". Click Apply.
Windows 8 - In the folder containing the file you want to share, click the View tab at the top of the window and check "File name extensions".
, For example, if the file is named filename.exe, you would delete .exe leaving just filename.


You will be asked to confirm that you want to change the extension. Confirm that you do, as the file will work perfectly fine when the extension is added back.
 You can drag the renamed file into the message window to attach it.
 This will likely take a few minutes.


If the file is too large, try sharing it through Google Drive.
 This will likely take a few moments as well. Make sure to include a note about the original extension and how to add it back.
 They don't need to have extensions displayed in order to add them, they just need to rename the file and add the original extension at the end.

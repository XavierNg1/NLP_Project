Check the web to see if your specific device has built-in screenshot capabilities, if you are not running Android OS 4.0.

 If you are having trouble capturing a screenshot, it is likely that your OS doesn't support screenshot capturing.
 On an Android device, you may need to hunt down your captured screenshot. Try checking the Documents App or your Recent Photos app. Certain devices store captured screenshots in different places, so you may need to look around for it.

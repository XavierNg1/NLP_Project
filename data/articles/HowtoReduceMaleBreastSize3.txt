 If you have tried exercise and dietary changes to no avail, or if you have a medical issue that is causing your gynecomastia, you may consider breast reduction surgery. You should set up a consultation with a plastic surgeon about male breast reduction surgery to ensure it is right for your condition.You can ask your GP for a referral to a plastic surgeon who specializes in breast reduction surgery for men. You may want to set up consultations with several surgeons to find one that is right for you.
Though breast reduction surgery is an effective way to reduce your breasts, you will need to also maintain a healthy weight, balance your hormonal levels, and avoid certain drugs to reduce the chances of developing gynecomastia again.
 Before you commit to breast reduction surgery, you should sit down with the surgeon and have her outline the procedure from start to finish.You will be put under general anaesthetic during the procedure, which should take around 90 minutes. Fatty tissue will be removed through an incision around your nipple. The surgeon may also make cuts down your chest to move excess tissue and then reposition your nipples.
You will need to recover overnight in the hospital and allow yourself a few days off to rest. You will also need to avoid any strenuous activity up to six weeks after the operation. You will have to wear an elastic garment after the operation to assist with healing and recovery.
 Though breast reduction surgery is often very effective, the surgery can leave red and lumpy scars in the area. They may appear for several months and then fade gradually over time.You are also at risk of losing sensation in your nipples and having uneven nipples as a result of the surgery.

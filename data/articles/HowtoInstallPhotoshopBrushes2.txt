 You don't even need to open up an image. Simply open up the program in order to install your brushes.


It can help to have a Finder or Windows Explorer window open showing the brushes as well. You will need to be able to find them again.
 There is a bar on the top of the screen that changes depending on what tool you have open. Simply press the B key to switch to the brush tool., It will be next to a small dot, usually, and is in the top left corner of the screen. This opens up the Brushes Preset Menu.
 This brings up a window that you can use to find your brushes. Go back to your ZIP file and look for the .apr file -- these are your new brushes.
 This will automatically add your brushes to your preset menu. You can find them anytime by opening the Brushes Preset Menu. Simply click the little gear symbol and find your new brush set at the bottom of the drop down menu.
 It doesn't get any easier. Simply click on the .apr file in a window or on your desktop, then drag and drop the file into Photoshop. The program will automatically organize the brushes for you. If neither of these strategies work, try out one other method:


Click on "Edit" from the top bar.
Click on "Presets" â†’ "Preset Manager."
Make sure "Preset Type:" is set as "Brushes."
Click "Load" and find your brushes, double clicking them to install them.

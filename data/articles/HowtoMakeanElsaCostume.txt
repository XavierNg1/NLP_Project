 For the shirt, unless you are wearing a dress, try to find something sparkly with long sleeves. Or, find two tops––one that is light blue and sparkly, and one with netted sleeves. You can stitch the netted sleeves onto the light blue top. If you can't find netted sleeves, find normal sleeves in the same color.;
, Elsa wears a long dress that is light blue. Try to find a skirt that is the same or a similar color that your top is.


If you can find a dress like Elsa's, great! Her actual dress has no sleeves, except for netted sleeves. Again, try to find a shirt with netted sleeves and sew the sleeves on or wear the shirt underneath, so as not to ruin the shirt. If you can't find a dress, do what was outlined with the shirt and skirt (above).
 Have it start in the middle of the scalp (a French fishtail).
 See How to do Elsa's coronation hair style for details.
 This will give it the icy sparkling look which Elsa has.
 Elsa has pale skin, which can be achieved by using foundation.
 Elsa has thick lashes. To achieve this, use lots of mascara. Perhaps use some fake lashes.
 Use purple and bronze colors. Use dark purple eyeshadow on your eyelids, and bronze above your eyelids, below your eyebrows. Make your eyes really stand out.
 Elsa has pink lips, so you should wear some lipstick, if needed, to enhance the color.

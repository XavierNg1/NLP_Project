 Simply lay one end of the rope over the rest of it to form a basic round loop. The bottom of the loop will be roughly where the knot will be located.

, Take the end of the rope and, keeping the loop intact, pass it through. You should have a simple cross-over and a small loop.

, Grab the end of the rope and a section above your loop. Then pull your hands apart to tighten your overhead knot simply and easily.

, This knot is not very tight, nor large, but it still has uses. Frequently it is used as a stopper, preventing the rope from passing back through a hole or opening (like a rock climbing belay). It can also help prevent the end of a hanging rope from fraying., To loosen the knot, push the ends of the knot back towards each other. Then push and pull to follow the end of the rope back through in the opposite direction as it came. You may have to pull at the edges of the knot to loosen it, but once you can wiggle the end of the rope through you should be able to untangle the knot.

 Whether you are using a premade wax strip, or if you are using hot wax that you heat up, you should exfoliate your skin about a day before you plan to wax.


Use a loofah or scrub to get rid of dead skin so the wax can grip the hairs better. Then, wash the area with a regular soap and water, and make sure it is completely dry.After cleansing your skin, sprinkle a bit of baby powder to the area about to be waxed. It'll absorb any excess moisture so the wax and cloth strip can adhere properly.
Waxing can be done on the upper lips, under arms, arms, legs, stomach, back, and bikini line.Any lotions or makeup on the skin may prevent the wax from removing the hair.;
, There are some simple tips that might make the waxing process less painful for you. You might want to explore more options for hair removal than waxing, too.If you have sensitive skin, you can take an ibuprofen half an hour before you begin. Be prepared to spend about an hour waxing as this is not something you want to rush.
If you menstruate, try not to wax right before or during your period; your skin may be much more sensitive, and it could be significantly more painful.
 A good choice would be to do the waxing in your bathroom after a shower.


If you wax in a cold environment, itâ€™s going to be a more painful process. Warm air helps your follicles stay open, and the hair will slide out more easily. This applies to plucking your eyebrows, too!
Go several days without shaving the area you want to wax; you will have best results when the hair is at least 1/4 inch long.

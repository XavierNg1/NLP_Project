 You only need credentials to cover private events. In other words, for any event that is in a public space, you can cover it without credentials., If you work for a newspaper or other type of media, your employer will usually issue an identification that shows you are with that company. That won't get you into every event, but it does provide information about you to people who need it.If you are a freelancer, you can ask for a press identification from one of your employers, or pick one of the many freelancing sites that offer credentials for anyone who works in the media., To get into specific events, you will need press passes for those events, issued by the event organizer. Either you or your editor will need to request passes for the event.The first question the organizers are going to ask is who you represent. They want to know that the photos you take will help publicize their event or person they represent.If you don't represent anyone in particular, you may still be able to gain access as long as you show you are a freelancer who covers similar events.That may mean you need to start out at smaller venues with easier access.Be sure you read the fine print. For instance, if you gain credentials, you may be giving away any copyrights to the photos to the event holders., With the pass, you may be allowed access to certain areas the general public isn't allowed. Stay within the guidelines outlined by the pass. Otherwise, your pass may be revoked, and you may have trouble getting one in the future.

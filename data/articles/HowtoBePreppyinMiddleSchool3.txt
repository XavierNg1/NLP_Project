 Start in the cafeteria. Say to one preppy, "I like your shoes!" She'll say thank you. If she compliments about you back, say thank you and then sit by her and her prep friends. Do school projects with them so other preps see that you, too, are a prep.
 Get their phone numbers and text them at least once a day.
 Invite them over, host a sleepover (Include makeovers as one of the activities), or... go SHOPPING!!! What prep doesn't love shopping? The possibilities are endless- Just make sure when you spend time with your new friends you don't do or act weird, gross or random (Like crossing your eyes, talking about health issues, etc).

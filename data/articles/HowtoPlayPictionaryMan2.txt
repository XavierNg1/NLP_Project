,, You will be given a short period of time to think about what to draw, then the timer will start., As you draw, your teammates will shout out answers. If a teammate guesses the right answer, push the large button on Pictionary Man's bottom to stop the timer and re-display the subject. If no one guesses within the time limit, play passes to the Picturist on the other team.

You can draw anything related to the subject, including a syllable in one of the words (such as a pen for "penny") or a homophone of one of the words (such as a boat dock for "doc"). You can also use punctuation and other symbols, except as described below, and you can make charade-like gestures while you're drawing.
You cannot draw letters or numbers (you can draw the outer portion of Superman's insignia, but not the "S") or dashes to show the length of any word in the answer. You also cannot draw ears to represent "sounds like." Your gestures cannot include sign language, and you cannot give clues verbally while drawing.
 The Pictionary Man score sheet consists of 2 rows of 15 boxes each. Mark a box when a team gets a correct answer. After 7 turns have been played, the game announces a Challenge round.

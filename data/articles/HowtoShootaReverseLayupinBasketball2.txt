 The closer you shoot to the baseline, the more your shot will be protected from potential blocks by the backboard. However, as you approach the baseline, your shooting angle will diminish. This can make for a more challenging shot to some.


In many cases, defense will determine just how close you can get to the basket. You may not always be able to perform the layup close to the baseline.
Taller and more aggressive defense may require reverse layups to be very close to the baseline., Spin on your ball will cause it to grip the backboard, allowing you to utilize more of the backboard when making your shot. As you release the ball, flick your wrist slightly to impart spin to the shot.


Each basketball player is different, so you should experiment with how you flick your wrist and the intensity with which you flick to find the way that works best for you., To be able to perform this shot in an instant on the court, you'll need it to be second nature. This means you'll have to practice it until the mechanics are deeply ingrained in your muscle memory. To drill for the reverse layup, you might:


Place four cones on the key. One cone should be placed at each elbow, and one at each second free throw block.
Start behind either elbow cone. Fake a shot, like you might while creating a buffer between you and the defense to cut to the inside, then take a single step back with your right foot.
Push off with your back right foot and cut to the hoop on the outside of the cones. When you are beside the cone at the second free throw block, drive to the baseline.
Shoot the reverse layup. Jump off your inside foot, delay your ball pickup slightly, and use your outside hand to flip the ball off the backboard and into the basket.

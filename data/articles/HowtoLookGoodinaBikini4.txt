 It is best to be in a positive mental state before you leave your house in your bikini so when you arrive to your destination, you are ready to have fun. Hiding in a corner, walking around slouched over, or deciding that you can't reveal yourself in your bikini after all will only keep you from having the great time you deserve. Before you leave the house, look in a mirror, and try saying the following:"I look great in my bikini, and I am going to have fun today!"
"I am a very attractive woman and I deserve to feel good about myself."

, Having proper posture creates flattering lines that will help you look more confident. Simply pull your shoulders back and bring your head up, to look leaner and taller. Imagine your navel being pulled up into your spine to help you pull in your abdomen. Try to remind yourself throughout the day to keep correcting your posture if you find yourself starting to slouch.Even when you are sitting down, you should be practicing proper posture by sitting with a straight back, your shoulders pulled-back, and your chin up.
 If you are among others in a swimsuit, chances are they are way more concerned about their body than they are yours. Most women have concerns about their bodies and appearance just like you do, and they are also probably looking for ways to look and feel their best in a bikini. If you can let go of your insecurities, and just have a good time, your positive vibes may rub off on those around you to create a more positive atmosphere.


When you arrive to your event or gathering, focus on everything except your bikini. Think about the friends you are there to meet and laugh with, the relaxation you want to achieve, or the new memories you are going to create. Concerns about the way you look in a bikini should be at the bottom of your list of things to think about.

 In French, unlike in English, the basic future tense does not use a helping verb. If you want to talk about something you will have at some point in the future, use this conjugation.Pronounce "j'aurai" as "ZHOR-ay."

, When you're addressing one person and want to talk about how they will have something in the future, conjugate avoir as "aura" (pronounced OHR-ah). Remember that the s at the end is silent., Since all objects have a gender, if you want to talk about how someone or something will have something in the future, use whichever gender is appropriate.For example, suppose you're talking to a friend about a boat you're going to buy. The French word for boat is masculine, "le bateau," so when you talk about the features the boat will have, you would say "il aura," or "it will have." Even though you used the masculine pronoun, you wouldn't translate the word directly as "he" in this context.
 When you are speaking about what you and another person will have in the future, conjugate avoir as aurons. Pronounce this conjugation "OHR-ohn," keeping the s silent.For example, you might say "nous aurons le poisson," or "we will have the fish."

, If you are talking to a group of people, and want to tell them about what they will have someday, use the second-person plural vous. This pronoun also is appropriate when you are speaking to someone formally, such as an authority figure., When speaking about a group of others, choose the pronoun that represents the gender of the entire group. Use ils for mixed-gender groups.The conjugation "auront" is pronounced "OHR-ohn," with the t remaining silent.

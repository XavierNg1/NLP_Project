 Put one of each gender in (one male and two females if you have Endangered Species DLC) so they will breed and replace the ones that die.;
, Donation Boxes help earn more money for your zoo. You can find them under scenery.
 Put a restroom nearby too. Maybe put in a gift stand, and after a while, upgrade to a shop, more stands, and maybe even a restaurant.
, Donations increase for a short time after guests use the Discovery Kiosk so add one as soon as you can. Guest amusement increases when they see arches, fountains and statues so add these strategically.
 When you get enough fame stars and your guests' entertainment bars are low, build a music rock or other entertainment needs. Kids like playground areas, for instance.
 It's aesthetically pleasing to many guests. If you wait long enough and plan your moves right, you should be a zoo tycoon!

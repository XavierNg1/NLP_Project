 The Maradona works best when the defender is approaching from an angle or from the side, rather than straight on. Diego Maradona himself used it countless times to escape seemingly impossible situations, in corners of the field or when surrounded by defenders. If a defender is approaching head on, it can be used to take the ball in a different direction.


One of the reasons the Maradona Turn is so effective is that it can be used in tight spaces.
When getting crowded on other sides by multiple defenders the move can be used to re-direct the ball out of a tight spot.
 The Maradona Turn is perfect to use when a defender is approaching fast, especially if they’re about to tackle. When you're moving fast down the field and an approaching defender or multiple defenders move to stop you, the sudden shift in speed of the Maradona will confuse your attacker(s).
 When the ball is stopped and you need to get it moving out of a tight place, and effective Maradona Turn can break you out of a stuck position inside the opposing team’s territory. Use it suddenly when you've been stopped by defenders, then take the ball off into open ground.
 The Maradona is meant to used with dynamic speed, not at top speed. Once again, the speed dynamics are what make the move so effective. When you’re attacking fast against multiple defenders, then stop on a dime, execute the turn almost casually, then speed off toward the goal, leaving the defenders bewildered and in your dust, it’s not only a highly effective maneuver, it’s one of the more stylish and artistic moves in soccer.


Use the move to de-accelerate, then re-accelerate in a different direction.
Be sure to pull the ball far enough behind you that it’s out of the defender’s reach, but where you can keep it in your own space and control.

 You can only do this using Google Chrome, or by installing the Firefox "Search by Image" extension.



Click here for instructions on installing Firefox extensions.
You can't right-click to search by image in any other web browsers.
 This will open a new tab with the Google Images search results.
 After the image is uploaded the search results will be displayed. Google will attempt to determine the original creator of the image based on search results, and will also display images that are visually similar. This can be very useful for finding additional images for a set. Beneath the similar image results, you'll see a list of pages that have the same image on them.
 If you no longer want to search by that image, you can click the "X" next to the image name in the Google Search bar.

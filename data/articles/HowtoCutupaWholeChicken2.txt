 Placing the chicken so that the breast is up will make it easier to see what you are doing.
 Pull it away from the body. You want to be able to see where the leg and hip bones connect.








You can also use a carving fork to hold the chicken in place while you pull the leg away from the body.
 Cutting through the skin on the side of the chicken will allow you to better see where the leg and body meet.
 Use the carving knife to cut through the hip joint to remove the entire leg. By pulling the leg out, you create right angle that is easier to cut through.
 Cutting through the cartilage will give you a clean cut without splintering any bone. Repeat these steps on the other leg.

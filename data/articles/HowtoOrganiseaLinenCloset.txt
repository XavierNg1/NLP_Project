 This makes the linen closet the most useful. Shelves allow you to organise vertically, not just stacking things. You can easily by hanging shelves from most major retailers like target, which are cost-effective ways to maximise space.









Spacing between shelves should be about 40 centimeter (15.7Â in) height. This allows for stacking and easy access. Any taller and the piles will be too tall and will topple easily.;
, Put towels together, sheets together, pillow cases together, etc.









Another method is to create piles or shelves by room, such as master bedroom, child's bedroom, guest bedroom, bathroom, dining room, etc.
 to keep like objects grouped together. Baskets, plastic containers, pull-out drawers on wheels, etc., all make great dividing containers to keep items separate. Towels, face washers, tablecloths, tea towels, and serviettes (napkins) will all fit into these containers easily, and can then be labelled to easily organise them.
 For example, sleeping bags, picnic rugs, guest sheets, dining table linen, etc. can all go up the top.









Try to keep infrequently used linen in packaging or bags for added protection and organisation.
 This is where you can keep your sewing machine, small appliances, a picnic basket, sewing items, etc.
 Hang wire baskets on the door; just check that the door shuts easily into the linen closet first. This can hold sewing items, feather dusters, light bulbs, shoelaces, fabric or name markers, etc. for easy finding.

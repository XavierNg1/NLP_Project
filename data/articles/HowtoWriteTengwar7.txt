 These includes:


Sindarin full mode of Gondor. Sort of a hybrid mode between the Sindarin mode of Beleriand and the Sindarin mode of Gondor.
Old English mode. A mode for writing Old English.
English (JRR Tolkien's mode). The original English mode, as used by JRR Tolkien.
English (Christopher Tolkien's mode). The mode of English used by JRR Tolkien's son, Christopher.
English full phonetic mode. A full mode of English. Spelling is based on the pronunciation of words, not their standard English spelling. As such, this mode shows a lot of variation between people (or even between the writings of one person) and is very tricky to learn.
English full alphabetical mode. Another full mode of English. This one is easier to learn because it is based on spelling instead of pronunciation.

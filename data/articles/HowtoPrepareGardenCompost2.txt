 An integral part of the composting process are the green materials which also known as nitrogen compounds. Add scraps like raw vegetable peelings, coffee grounds, cut grass, and crushed egg shells to your compost receptacle. Avoid adding meat, bones, or fish scraps to your compost as they will attract pests or rodents., Dry, brown materials combine with green nitrogen compounds to form the base contents of garden compost. These include cardboard (e.g. cereal boxes paper towel rolls, newspaper, hedge clippings, twigs, sawdust, wood shavings and old leaves. Mix the nitrogen and carbon compounds as evenly as possible, but have a greater concentration of brown materials for the best results (approximately 2:1)., To accelerate the composting process, cut all the scraps to be included in it into the smallest possible pieces. Twigs and branches should be clipped into small parts, eggshells should be crushed, cardboard should be shredded, and fruit and vegetable scraps should be cut up as finely as they can be., Water the compost pile as needed to keep it moist. As a general rule, the materials should be damp and not overly wet. If you live in a rainy climate, cover your compost area with a tarp or plastic sheeting to prevent it from becoming waterlogged., If you do not have a compost tumbler, use a shovel or garden fork to mix the contents of the compost bin thoroughly. Move contents from the bottom to the top and vice versa. This aids in the decomposition rate by adding oxygen, the last ingredient needed to compost., After the first few days of adding compost ingredients, the pile should heat up as a result of the decomposition process. This heat will subside when the process is done and the compost is ready. Use a thermometer or simply reach into the middle of the compost pile with your hand to test how warm it is.


When the compost is done "cooking" and cools down, it will be ready to use.

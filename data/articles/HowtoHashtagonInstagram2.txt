 This should be in the middle of the bottom of your screen.
 You can do so by either selecting 'Library,' 'Photo' or 'Video' option from the bottom of your screen.


If you're posting an existing photo or video, select it from your library. Then click Next and select a filter if desired.
If you're taking a new photo or video, use the circle button to take it. Choose the filters and do any editing if needed.
 Keep your tags relevant; for example, a baker might place "#muffins" in the description box.
 This will save your tags.
 Your tagged photo/video should now be in circulation!

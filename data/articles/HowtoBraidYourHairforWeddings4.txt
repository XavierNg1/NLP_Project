 A rope braid can be styled from a long ponytail or twisted into an elaborate bun.,

Gather hair into a ponytail and secure the ponytail with a hair elastic.






Part the ponytail into 2 sections. Hold the right section in your right hand and the left section in your left hand.






Twist the right section of hair, then cross it over the left section of hair. Twist the rightmost section, which was the left section prior to the crossover, and cross it over the other section.






Continue this process until the rope braid is the desired length.






Secure the rope braid with a hair elastic.



Wrap the completed rope braid around the ponytail holder, forming a circle around the ponytail holder. Depending on the length of your hair, you may need to wrap the rope braid around several times. This will create a twisted bun.
Tuck the end of the rope braid under the bun and secure with bobby pins.
Secure the bun with additional bobby pins.

 Technically, you can make a mimosa with any fruit juice. All you need to worry about is getting the ratio of fruit juice to champagne right. This recipe is great for when you're in the mood for something different.
 Combining apricot nectar, pineapple nectar, orange juice and champagne, this mimosa is about as tropical as you can get.
 It runs off the tip of your tongue thrillingly, just as it runs down your throat enticingly. This mimosa is a simple mix of guava and champagne, topped with maraschino cherries on top.

 Songkran Day or Thailand New Year is one of the biggest events in Thailand each year. Seeing in the Thai New Year means a constant festive feel, with parades, music, shows, people out on the streets and more happening all of the time. There will also be the biggest water fight imaginable!;
, The Thai New Year water plays consist of two principal parts: Water and white powder. The white powder is placed on your face by other people out celebrating.
 You will have no troubles purchasing a water gun on the streets of every Thai city and town. There will be guns in differing sizes, priced from around 100 - 800 baht. You can even buy the water if needed, as the shopkeepers have large water barrels on their premises.
 If you plan to get around via some form of transport, make sure you've already reserved it well in advance because if you haven't, you'll find everyone else has! Songkran time is going home time for many workers in Bangkok who came from other regions in Thailand and they will all want to go home for the celebrations.
 The Tourism Authority of Thailand organizes street walks during Songkran. The walks pass in front of the Central World Plaza, one of Thailand's large properties, and the walk continues all the way through Silom Road, up to Siam Square. Siam Square is the location for a special event that is held on the platform at Sanam Luang near the Grand Palace.
 There are a number of extra activities available to make the Songkran experience more enjoyable:


DJs will be playing all kinds of music
People throwing water on each other and putting powder on each other's faces
Dancing on the streets etc.
 Songkran brings joy and happiness to all and it is a great idea for you as a tourist to get into the spirit of the occasion and have a great time too!

 Apply your makeup as you normally would; for example, moisturizer, foundation and concealer. This will prepare your face for the application of eye shadow, blush and lipstick., Use your finger or an eye shadow brush to apply a single wash of color to your eyelid. Also apply a line of shadow along your lower lash line.Because dark mascaras can overpower a monochromatic look, use a lighter mascara, like a brown or dark brown, on your lashes.
 Dip your brush in the blush. Before you apply the blush, tap the brush to get rid of any excess powder. Then sweep the blush over the apples of your cheeks, or along your cheekbones.For an intense flush, sweep the blush up to your temples.
 Apply a lipstick that is the same color or a varying shade of your base color. Apply the lipstick with your finger to get a more natural, less graphic look.Use a lighter shade for daytime and a darker shade for nighttime.

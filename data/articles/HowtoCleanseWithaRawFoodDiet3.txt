If you are starting a cleanse on Monday and you eat your dinner the night before on Sunday at 8:00 pm, you will not eat or drink anything other than water until 8:00 pm on Monday.
After you complete your fast, you will be able to reintroduce a variety of foods into your diet.
 You will continue to eat these foods for the length of the cleanse.


Start by introducing fresh, uncooked fruits back into your diet. Fruits are generally easy on the digestive system and by starting with them first after the fast, you are less likely to experience any stomach discomfort. Examples of fruits that are good for cleansing include apples, pears, watermelon, mangoes, bananas, grapes, peaches, plums, coconut and any berries.
After you have introduced fruit, begin adding some fresh, uncooked vegetables to your diet. You can continue to eat fruits, but may want to alternate between fruits and vegetables or eat a combination of the two. Examples of vegetables that have excellent cleansing properties include cucumbers, celery, red beets, cabbage, onions, avocados and dark, leafy greens.
Include leaves, stems and roots of plants in your diet if possible.

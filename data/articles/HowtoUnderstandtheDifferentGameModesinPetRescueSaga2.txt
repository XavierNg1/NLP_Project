 In Classic Mode, there are no pets in play. Instead, you need to clear a certain percentage of blocks in order to beat the level.
 Match the same-colored blocks to clear the blocks off the screen. Some obstacles also count towards the total number of blocks, so take them out as well. Use the items and boosters available for you in the level.


Save the rocket booster for last, as it can clear out one of the last remaining columns of blocks that wonâ€™t match. Clearing out these last few blocks can make or break your game.
 Most likely, levels in Classic Mode will require a minimum number of points, on top of the percentage of blocks cleared.


Focus on getting huge points by combing out huge groups of same-colored blocks on every move. Doing so will help you rank higher in your leaderboards.

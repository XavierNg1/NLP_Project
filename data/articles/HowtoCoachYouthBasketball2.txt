 Letting your players know who you are is a necessary first step, and it shouldn’t be limited to a name. Tell the kids where you’re from, what your background is, how much basketball you play or played, and why you decided to get into coaching. Most importantly, tell them what your plans are—not only for yourself, but for them. Young athletes need direction, and the sooner you lay out your vision, the more likely they are to latch on from the get-go.
 It may be unrealistic to expect the same amount of detail from each of the kids you’ll be coaching, but encouraging them to share information about themselves will not only make the rest of the group feel comfortable, it will provide you with more of a sense of what each of the players is about.
 It’s important for kids to feel comfortable out on the court, and giving them a chance to play their preferred position is a good way to accomplish that. But it certainly couldn’t hurt to find out if anyone is willing or interested in trying different positions. Youth basketball should always be about fun first. If a player doesn’t want to switch, that should always be his or her choice.

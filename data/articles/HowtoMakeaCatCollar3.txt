 Use fabric scissors to cut away the collar portion of a toddler's button-down shirt.


Lay the unbuttoned shirt face-down on a flat surface. Pop the collar up.
Carefully cut just beneath the seam on the side facing the body side of the shirt (not the collar side). Cut as close as possible to the seam without cutting through it.
 Dab a thin line of seam sealant over the raw, cut edge of the collar to prevent any fraying.


Let the seam sealant dry completely before you continue.
 Cut a 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) wide strip of nylon webbing to a length 1 inch (2.5 cm) wider than the circumference of your cat's neck.


You can measure the nylon webbing directly against your cat's neck or use a soft measuring tape to take the measurement. Either way, the cut piece of nylon webbing should be wrap around your cat's neck loosely, allowing you to fit two fingers between it and your cat.
Alternatively, you can skip the nylon webbing and use an old collar that has been previously fitted to the circumference of your cat's neck.
 Draw a line of fabric glue or hot glue down the length of the webbing, then press the webbing to the inside of the shirt collar.


Lay the unbuttoned collar on a flat surface with the "wrong" side facing up and the folds pointing down.
Place the glue on the nylon webbing, then press the webbing onto the wrong side of the collar adhesive-side down. The ends of the webbing should lie just to the insides of the button and button hole.
You can pinch and fold the collar to match the length of the webbing, if necessary, but you should not fold the webbing to match the length of the the collar.
Let everything dry completely before continuing.
 Once the glue dries, wrap the collar around your cat's neck with the webbing-side facing in. Button the front together to hold the collar in place.

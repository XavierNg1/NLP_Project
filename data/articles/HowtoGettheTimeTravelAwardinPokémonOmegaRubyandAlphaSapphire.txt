 It doesn't have to be a special Pokémon; any Pokémon from the games will do.;
, For this, you'll need an original DS or DS Lite console, which has slots for a DS game and a GBA game. Migrating Pokémon in the 4th generation games is done at the Pal Park, located on Route 221 in Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, and in Fuchsia City in HeartGold and SoulSilver. You need to have beaten the Pokémon League before you can access the Pal Park. You can migrate 6 Pokémon per day.
 In order to do this, you'll need 2 DS, 3DS, or 3DS consoles; one with the Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver, and one with Black, White, Black 2, or White 2. Go to the Pokémon Transfer Lab on Route 15 and talk to the people at the top of the lab. Then, turn on the DS with Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver and select "DS Download Play" (the orange icon with a DS on it on the 3DS). Pick your Black, White, Black 2, or White 2 game and choose the Pokémon from the Ruby or Sapphire game that you want to transfer. In order to migrate the Pokémon, you'll have to play a minigame where you throw Poké Balls at Pokémon while they move around the screen. Don't worry if you don't get every Pokémon - unlike the 4th generation games, you can migrate Pokémon as often as you like.
 For this, you need a 3DS or 2DS, Poké Transporter, Pokémon Bank, and an internet connection.

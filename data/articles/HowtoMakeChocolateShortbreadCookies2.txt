 After you form a dough, take the dough out of the mixing bowl, scraping it off the sides if necessary. Place the dough on a cutting board and roll it into a ball shape. Then using a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a disc about ¾ inch (1.9 cm) thick. Use your fingers to round the edges of the disc., After you make the disc of dough, wrap it in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Chilling the dough will make the shortbread cookies a better consistency when baked., Turn the oven up to 325 degrees F (162.7 C). While you are waiting for the oven to heat, line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Use the end of a stick of butter to lightly grease the parchment paper., After you have chilled your dough ball, take it out of the refrigerator and break off chunks of the dough, either using your hands or a cookie scoop. Once you break off the dough, roll the dough pieces into balls that are about 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter.


After you have finished making your balls of dough, place them on the greased parchment paper.
Try not to over-handle your dough. Over-handling dough makes cookies that are dense, as opposed to crisp.



If you want to make you chocolate shortbread cookies into fun shapes, don’t create balls of dough. Instead, use cookie cutters to punch out shapes in the disc of dough, and place the cookies on the greased parchment paper.

 Include the subject (like that English essay) how much time you think it's going to take (for example, 10 minutes to an hour) and all those other pieces of homework.
 You might give yourself 10 minutes to look over everything., Put it in order. If you have a history report due on Monday, and a essay due on Tuesday, do the stuff that is due on Monday first!

If you find it helps you, write out an actual ordered to-do list of your assignments, based on when they're due and how crucial they are.
 For example, 2 hours of homework on Saturday, to get a majority of it done, and 30 minutes on Sunday, to finish up if you haven't already and possibly work on any assignments due on Tuesday or Wednesday., Just like when you did your homework list, write out whatever you have to get done at home, too. Include what you have to do, how much time you are going to take to do it, and when you are going to do it., Did your parents tell you to do laundry on Saturday, and you have time to do your assignments on Sunday? Then put the chores first - or, better yet, do some of your homework while you're waiting for the laundry to finish, and you can hit two birds with one stone. If you're smart about both time management and prioritization, you can get all the "boring" tasks of your weekend out of the way., Make sure all your assignments are out of the way. Check over everything, and then go outside! Go for a jog, play hopscotch and go to the park! You deserve it!

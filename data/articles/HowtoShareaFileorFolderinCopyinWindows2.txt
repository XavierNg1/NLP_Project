 Go to your Start menu and locate the Copy folder. Click on the Copy application shortcut from there. Copy will be launched, and reside on your notification tray on the lower right side of your screen.


If Copy is already running, there is no need to launch it again.
 Look for Copy on your notification tray. It will have an icon of an origami crane. Right-click on it to bring out a menu. Select “Open Copy Folder” from it. The folder will be opened.
 Browse through your Copy folder and find the folder you want to share. Click on it to select. All the files and subfolders within this folder will be shared together.
 Right-click on the folder you want to share and select “Copy Actions” then “Copy Public Link.” The share link to your folder and all its contents is created and put on your clipboard.


You can use this link by pasting it on your email, IM, Facebook, Twitter, and others. Anybody who has access to this link can now access the folder and all its contents.
 Right-click on the folder you want to share and select “Copy Actions” then “Send Public Link” or “Share.” A message dialog box will appear. Input the email addresses of your invitees or recipients in the first field and write your message on the second field.


Click on the “OK” button when done.
The share link will be created and sent together with your message to the recipients you’ve input. Your recipients can now use this link to access the folder and all its contents.
For this step, there’s no need for you to leave Copy and go to your email client to send the message. Copy uses its own email server for the emails.

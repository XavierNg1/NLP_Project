, You will be sitting the vegetable up in the next stage on this cut edge. An uneven cut may make the vegetable slip when you are slicing.
 You can rechauff√© these into anything else such as soups, stocks and sauces or mashed vegetables. The vegetable should now have right angled corners and straight sides.
 Any leftover can also be a reheated in the same way. You should now have a pile of 4mm x 5cm slices.
 Even the edges as that assures an even result. Then slice them in 4mm / 1/8th of an inch slices to make long matchsticks.









Curved vegetables such as celery or cucumber should be cut into the 5cm portions, then sliced long ways (or with the grain) to give even slices, then these can be julienned.
 These can be used as a garnish or steamed, fried or sauteed as a main vegetable.

 In the top right, there's a button that says "Apply for Credit." Click that.


From the resulting popup menu, click on Apply Online.
 This button is located at the bottom right of the screen, and will begin the application process.
 You will be asked to provide pertinent information such as your legal name, address, Social Security number and residential information as well as financial information including your current occupation, income and employment history.
 If all of the information is valid and the application has been completed to the best of your ability, submit the online application. Understand that submission of your application grants consent for Ford Credit to run a review of your credit history.
 The official web site advises that you may receive a response in as little as three minutes. However, the average response time is 10 to 30 minutes. If approved, you may print the enclosed certificate for your records.

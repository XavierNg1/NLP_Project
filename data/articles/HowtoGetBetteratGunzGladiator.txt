,,, This involves turning sideways about 50째<(turn)<120째

, (The yellow shiny light) Think about it as a head-on-head collision. Your block vs their massive. If they massive forward, you block forward. If they massive upward, you block downward (due to bad coding, theirs seems as if its coming out the ground), and vise versa. If they massive backwards, block backwards (due to bad coding, it seems as if it comes out from behind you). There are a few more glitches that you can use to block massives.
 This involves breaking their defense and slashing repeatedly. Finding your own method will work best.
 Such as instead of doing DBF > DBF > DBF > DBF > DBF, you'd do DBF > Light-step > DBF > Light-step, or something of the sort. But instead of making it repeated, you'd do TBF > Light-step > DBF > DBF > Light-step > DBF > DBF > DBF > DBF > Light-step > TBF > Light-step. Don't copy me or it will defeat the purpose.
 A 0째 degree slash will be recoiled by a 0째 block. It follows the same concept of massives, but is less glitchy.
 Butterfly is a glitch, find your own. Surprise your opponent, take advantages of their cons and your pros.
 Spar is a non-recorded 1v1, so no one can go bragging about how they beat you 10-0, this is to practice.

 Doing this is a very good way to seem cold and emotionless but is a lot more workable than trying not to feel anything.


Act with lust, affection and longing instead of love.
Act in a contented way with pride and enthrallment instead of joy.
Use rage, irritation and exasperation instead of anger.
Act with shame and disappointment instead of sadness.
 The lack of expressions are a key feature of Moriarty's face, for instance:


Moriarty's face is usually set in a cold blank look when thinking or explaining things, but she finishes each sentence with a coy smile or smirk. This is a calculated manipulation tactic as most facial expressions don't come naturally to her.
 She is also blunt and to the point. However, she may act coy to get a point across or as another manipulation tactic.


Moriarty will always tell people what she wants, with absolutely no shyness or doubt.

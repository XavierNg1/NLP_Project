 This is a great way to make a quick savory snack and use up pie dough at the same time. You can experiment with fillings, but generally quiches are made from a mixture of egg and milk with vegetables, seafood, cheese, bacon or ham, and herbs mixed in.
You can use whatever vegetables, spices, and cheese you have on hand mixed with egg and milk as a filling.
An easy recipe for mini quiches is a quick zucchini and egg quiche.
 You will need the following ingredients and supplies: 3 eggs
1 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese
1 zucchini, grated
1 small onion, chopped
Leftover pie dough
A muffin tin

, You will make small quiche crusts with this. Divide the pie dough into small balls about 1 inch in diameter.
On a floured surface, roll out each ball into a circle about 5 inches in diameter.
Gently press each circle into a muffin cup, stretching or patching the dough until it reaches all the way to the top of each muffin cup.
Using the tines of a fork, poke small holes into each quiche crust on the bottom and the sides.
 They will need to be partially baked before you add the filling. These will need to bake for about 15 minutes.
The crusts might puff up in the first 5 minutes of baking.
If this occurs, open the oven and poke any air pockets with a fork to decrease the puffiness of the dough.
 You can do this while the crusts are baking. In a small bowl, mix the eggs and buttermilk with a whisk.
Add the salt, spices and cheese and whisk again.
Then add the zucchini and onion, and whisk to evenly combine all the ingredients.
 You can use a ladle to spoon it into the crusts. Fill each crust about 3/4 of the way.
Any leftover filling can be put into ramekins and baked into crustless quiches.
Put the filled crusts in the muffin tin and any ramekins in the oven.
Bake at 350 degrees for 20-35 minutes, checking every so often to see if the eggs are setting.

 Wash 3 ripe avocados and 1 serrano chile. Peel the husks off of 3 tomatillos and wash the sticky residue off of them. Slice the avocados in half and remove the pits. Scoop the flesh into a blender. Slice away the ends of the tomatillos where the husks were and put the tomatillos into the blender. Trim off the end of the serrano chile and put it in the blender.If you want a spicier avocado salsa, add another serrano chile to the blender.
 You should add 1 clove of peeled garlic, the juice from one lime, and 4 tablespoons of Mexican cream or sour cream to the produce in the blender.Wait to add the water since you'll only need it if the salsa is too thick.
 Put the lid on the blender and blitz the avocado salsa until it's completely smooth. Remove the blender from the base and stir the salsa to check the texture. If the salsa is too thick, add 2 tablespoons of the water and blend it it. Continue to add small amounts of water until the salsa is the consistency you want it to be.If your blender isn't very powerful, consider roughly chopping the produce.
You may need to stop and stir the sides of the blender once you've blended the salsa.
 Transfer the salsa to a serving bowl and refrigerate it for one hour. This will help the flavors develop. Taste the avocado salsa and adjust the seasonings before you serve it. Consider adding the 1 teaspoon of salt according to your taste.If you want a tangier taste, squeeze the juice of another lime into the salsa before you serve it.

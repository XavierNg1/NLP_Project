 Then you can decide on which ingredients will be right for you. Have a look at the list below to give you a general idea of what hair type category you fit into.



Dry: looks dull, has split ends, damages easily, breaks easily. This could be due to damage or just lack of oil production.

Oily: becomes greasy if not washed daily, looses its shine and "swish" throughout the day.

Combination: oily at the roots, but dry and damaged towards the ends. This is often due to over-styling and brushing.

Normal: doesn't have many problems, usually looks shiny, not many split ends, easy to manage. This type may not need a hair mask.
 Then, wash your hair as normal, but don't apply conditioner, just stop after shampooing. Squeeze any excess moisture out of your hair and comb. Then, take your mask (make it in a bowl before going for your shower), and apply evenly through the hair. Leave for 10-20 minutes and rinse with lukewarm water. Finish with a cold rinse to close the hair follicle. Follow these instructions unless indicated to do differently with any of the ingredients below.

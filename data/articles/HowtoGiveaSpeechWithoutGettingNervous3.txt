 If you try to contain all of your body’s nervous energy, then you may find yourself jittering on the stage. Instead, take a quick walk before your presentation. Or, do a few toe flexes or even jumping jacks. Release that excess energy and your body will calm down., Make sure that you are taking deep breaths both before, and during, your speech. You might even think, “in” and “out” and you inhale and exhale. If you find yourself holding your breath, then let it out slowly and continue speaking. Use pauses in your presentation as an opportunity to reset your breathing.You may also want to do a quick body scan. Close your eyes, breathe in deeply, and focus on any areas where you feel yourself tensing your muscles. Take a deep breath in, and try to soften the tension as you exhale., Talk with the organizer for your speech or the teacher for your class and discuss the dress code with them. As you’ll be a center of attention, you want to dress the same, or even nicer, than your audience. You can also consider your clothing as your armor and try to visualize feeling stronger when you put on your speech outfit.


Try your outfit on before you give your speech to make sure everything fits well and that you feel comfortable. This helps prevent awkward adjusting during your speech.
 Keep your back straight and stand up as tall as you can. Pull your shoulders back and avoid hunching over. Dip your chin to check your notes, if needed, but then keep your head raised up.Watch out for jittery behaviors, such as tapping your fingers or twirling a pen. Practicing a good deal will help you to spot these actions and work on eliminating them prior to your final speech.

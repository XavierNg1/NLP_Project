 Boiling water can be used to partially or fully cook the noodles, but it is the only way to fully cook the noodles if you do not plan on cooking them further as part of another dish.









The boiling method works especially well if you plan on using the rice noodles in cool noodle dishes, including salads and bean dishes. Boiling the noodles is also recommended for flat rice noodles used as wrappers.
 Dry rice noodles are very brittle, so they must be handled carefully if you do not want to break them into tiny pieces.









Fresh rice noodles are not brittle, but they are not cooked with boiling water. Instead, they are usually steamed or added to recipes without being soaked first.
 Instead, they must be covered with boiling water and allowed to cook off the stove.









To fully cook the noodles, allow them to soak for 7 to 10 minutes, stirring them gently every 1 to 2 minutes to help loosen them. The noodles are done when they are completely limp. Thin, thread-like noodles may cook in less than 7 minutes, while flat rice noodles may take more than 10 minutes if they are thick.
Remove the noodles sooner if you plan on cooking them in another dish. The noodles should be pulled out once they just begin to separate if you plan on cooking them further in other hot dishes. This will only take a few minutes.
To create a chewier noodle, pre-soak the noodles in lukewarm water before cooking them in boiling water. Soak the noodles in lukewarm water until they are just barely pliable. Drain, then finish cooking in boiling water for an additional 2 minutes or until the center is chewy but not hard.
 Tossing the rice noodles with sesame oil will prevent them from clumping together or drying out, which is ideal if you plan on serving them on their own or in cold dishes.









Skip this step if you are immediately adding the rice noodles to another cooked dish.

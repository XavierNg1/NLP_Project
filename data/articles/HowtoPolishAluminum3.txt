 Use a soft cloth to apply aluminum polish to the piece. Wipe it on using small, circular motions. Do not use aluminum polish on pots, pans, or cookware -- even if you plan to wash the item after -- as it should never be ingested.
 After applying aluminum polish to your item, wipe the residue off the aluminum with a clean, soft cloth. Pay special attention to handles, crevices, and etchings to be sure to remove all traces of the aluminum polish., Once you remove all the polish, youâ€™ll want to buff the item to restore the shine. Choose a new, clean, soft cloth to do your buffing. Buff using small, circular motions in the same way you applied and removed the aluminum polish.

 Use a mix, or bake from scratch. Chocolate or vanilla work best and are usually the most popular flavors.;
, Use a knife to cut straight across the top of the wrapper. Place the top piece aside; you'll be reusing it shortly.
 Once you've made the frosting, spread it over the whole top of the bottom piece of each cupcake.
 Take the piece you cut off earlier and use the cookie cutter to press out a heart shape from the center. Keep the outline of the heart, removing the internal heart shape piece (you're allowed to eat it).
 There will now be a heart of frosting pushing up through the cupcake. Repeat for each cupcake left.
 Add sprinkles to the frosted part. The cupcakes are now ready for serving.

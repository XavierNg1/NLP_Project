 You won't want them to know that you snuck out, which is why it's important that you're already home and in bed by the time they wake up. Be quiet when you sneak back in so that you don't wake anyone up.
 Sometimes it's easier to come back in through your front door than to leave through it. Plus, if you get caught sneaking back in, you can always say that you came downstairs to get a glass of water from the kitchen or a late night snack.


If you have a loud dog, an alarm, creaky stairs, etc., then climb back in your window they same way you climbed out.
 Whether you used a rope or ladder, leave it in place so that you can use it get back into your bedroom. Be sure to replace the screen on your window and close your window before going to bed.


Hide the rope before you go to sleep so that nobody sees it.
Wake up early to put the ladder back where you found it before your parents realize it is missing.

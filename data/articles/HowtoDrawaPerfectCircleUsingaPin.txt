 To draw the circle you will need a pencil, a push pin, some string, some paper and some cardboard. Gather all of these things before moving on.;
, Since the paper is thin and and pin is sharp, it will obviously go through. To prevent the pin from damaging anything or ripping the paper, rest the paper on top of the cardboard. Secure the paper by taping the edges to the cardboard. This will stop it from moving.
 Make sure the string is very tight. If you want to, you could tape it onto the pencil. That should secure it in place and stop it from moving.
 The pin should go through the string. Alternatively, you could tie the other end of the string onto the pin. After that, push the pin into the paper but not right through the cardboard. If you let go and don't tug on the pencil, the pin should stay up. Don't sweat if it doesn't.
 With the index finger of your non-dominant hand, keep the pin up. Now with your dominant hand, pull the pencil around the pin to draw the circle. You may need to swap holding and drawing hands after you've drawn the semi-circle.

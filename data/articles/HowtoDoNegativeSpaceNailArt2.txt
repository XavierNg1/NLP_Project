 You will need to use a thin tipped nail brush here rather than the brush that comes with your nail polish. You can buy this in a beauty supply store. Using whichever nail color you prefer, draw a horizontal line in the middle of your nail. Go slowly to keep the line straight and even., Paint your nail from the line to the tip. Use the same color you used to draw on the line. You can use the regular brush that came with your nail polish to paint your nail.It can help to use something to cover the space below for protection. For example, take a paper hole reinforcement. This is a small strip of paper used to patch up binders, that should have one sticky edge. Place it on the lower part of your nail, so it's covering up some of that space.If necessary, add another coat.
 You will again use the thin tipped nail brush. Select a different color. It should be different than your original color, distinct enough to stand out. For example, you can do black and white, orange and pink, blue and pink, and so on. Paint a line just below the first line you painted, going slowly to keep the line straight and even.When you're done, the tip of your nail should be painted and there should be one stripe of a different color below the painted tip.
 Let your nails dry. This can take anywhere from half an hour to an hour. Then, add a layer of top coat. This will protect your nails and keep your manicure in place longer.

 Use a match or lighter to heat up and sterilize the pin. Expose every bit of the pin to fire for several seconds to kill off any bacteria., Give the pin at least a minute to cool down. It should not be painfully hot when you use it to pop your pimple., Apply rubbing alcohol to the pin, to your hands, and to the zit. Be sure that everything involved in the procedure is sanitized with rubbing alcohol., You do not want to point the pin toward your face. Instead, you should hold it along your face, so that when you poke your pimple it wonâ€™t penetrate anything but the very tip of the pimple., Do not touch anything but the white part of the zit. Penetrating the red part of the pimple will cause scarring. Instead, run the pin through the very tip of the pimple, so that it goes through one end and out the other., The pin should have penetrated the length of the white tip. Pull the pin out, away from your face, so that it ruptures the white tip when you remove the pin from the pimple., Do not squeeze the white top itself. Instead, squeeze the outside of the pimple so that it pushes out the pus. Consider squeezing with a cotton swab to avoid doing additional damage to the skin., Use a cotton swab to rub the area down with alcohol and clean up bacteria. Apply a small amount of bacitracin ointment to the area.

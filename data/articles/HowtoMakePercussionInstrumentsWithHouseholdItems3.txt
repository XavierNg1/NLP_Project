 Use a single hole punch to punch 5 or 6 evenly spaced holes around the edge of a plastic or paper plate. If you use thin paper plates, you may want to stack 2 plates together for added stability.
 For the tambourine, you'll need as many jingle bells and twist ties as you have holes. Run the twist tie through the middle of each jingle bell and bend both ends towards each other to prevent the bell from falling off of the tie.
 Run the twist tie of each jingle bell through a hole in the edge of the plate. Tie each bell on tightly by twisting the twist tie around itself. You can now play the tambourine by either shaking it or by striking the plate's surface with your palm or fingers.

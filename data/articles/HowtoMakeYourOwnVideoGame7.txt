 Each engine supports specific platforms, and some require different licenses to release on different platforms. For example, with Game Studio, you can release on Windows and Mac OS X with the Standard version, but need to upgrade to the Pro version and pay an extra fee to release mobile versions.
 Once you are nearing your game’s release, start trying to attract some attention. Release some screenshots and video clips of your game in action on popular gaming forums. Contact gaming news sites and let them know that your game will be releasing soon (be sure to include how to get it, how much it costs, and a summary of the game).


Create a company website during production so that you can start building followers. Hosting a forum for your game is a great way to get fans talking to each other, and regularly updating your site can start to draw more attention.
 Some independent developers will host the game on their own website, but you may find that demand costs you a significant amount in hosting fees, and some hosts can’t support the load that a successful game requires. There are several popular outlets for releasing independent games on PC and Mac OS X:


Steam
Desura
Humble Store
GOG
Mobile games typically need to be released through their prospective stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store, etc.). The same goes for console games (Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, etc.).
Different services will take different cuts on the sale of your game. Research each one to see if they are right for you. Most services have sales reps that you can speak with directly as a developer.
 Once your game is released, support it as much as financially possible with bug fixes and more content. The age of digital distribution means that games can be updated quicker than ever before. There are bound to be bugs that appear once the population at large has access to your game. Do what you can to fix these as soon as possible.

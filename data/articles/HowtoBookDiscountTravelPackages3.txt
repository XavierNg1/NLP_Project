 Travel deal sites usually have extensive fine print at the bottom of the page. Make sure that every box you have ticked has been chosen and not populated by the site itself.
 You can go to Trip Advisor's website to read reviews from former customers.
 If there is any risk you will not be able to take your vacation, then adding in travel insurance on Expedia, Hotwire or another site may reduce the risk of losing money. Read the insurance stipulations carefully, so that you know what is covered and what is not.
 Booking with a credit card lowers the risk associated with travel businesses going bankrupt. Credit cards often advocate for refunds on purchases that are subject to bankruptcy, but if you book with a debit card, check or with cash, you are not likely to get your money back.
 Many travel sites allow you to input your mileage numbers before you book. If they do not, ask the airlines to give you credit at the airport.

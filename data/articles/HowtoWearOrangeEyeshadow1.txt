 Neon orange compliments any skin tone. If you don’t want to go that bright, choose something catered to your skin shade. For ivory skin, choose apricot – a pale, yellowish orange. If you have olive skin, try coral shades infused with pink. Opt for bold, tangerine orange if you have dark skin., Wash your face and use your favorite moisturizer. Apply concealer under your eyes and on your eyelids, then blend it in with a makeup sponge. Dab on your foundation and blend it in with a makeup sponge or brush.


Using concealer on your eyelids will prime your lids for shadow. Using concealer underneath your eyes will mask discoloration such as dark circles.
If your complexion is reddish, use foundation to cancel out the red before rocking orange shadow., Pluck or trim any stray hairs, if desired. Your eyes will be the focus of this look, so you want a clean canvas around them. If you keep your eyebrows natural, no problem! Fill in any sparse areas with eyebrow pencil or shadow. Set your brows with a clear gel and an eyebrow wand.
 Wear a neutral lip color so it doesn’t compete with your eyeshadow. Blend a bit of your orange eyeshadow into the blush or bronzer you use on your cheeks. This will compliment the look of your eyes.If your eyeshadow is more of a subtle apricot, then you can opt for a darker orange lip color.

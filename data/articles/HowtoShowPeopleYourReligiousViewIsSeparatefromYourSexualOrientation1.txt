 Try researching your religion, as well as any sects it has, and perhaps other religions too. You may also find prayer to be useful. Ask yourself...


How does God (or the gods) feel about sexuality?
What does your religion say about how to treat people who are different?;
, Learn about different identitiesâ€”from lesbian to bisexual to aromantic. You may find that it helps to have a word for your sexuality, or you may not care much for labels. Your identity is your own, and you will understand and accept it at your own pace.
 You may choose to actively participate there, or just read/listen to what other people have to say. This can help you understand yourself and others, and inform your worldview.
 What do these groups of people feel? Do you agree with them? Consider whether your views upon sexuality align with those of your church, or if you are at odds with your religious leaders.


For some people, their church's view upon sexuality is a dealbreaker, and they switch to another church or stop being religious.
Some people feel that while their religion's views on sexuality are undesirable, the rest of the religion has enough merits to make them stay in the church. You are not obligated to agree with everything your religious leaders say.
Some people find a church that shares their views on sexuality.
 Having a general sense of what to say can help you be prepared to communicate your views. Here are some things to consider for your outline...


Discuss how your personal religious beliefs tie into accepting people of all sexualities.
Assure people that you do not share the beliefs of religious fanatics (for example, the Westboro Baptist Church).
Define your religion and/or sexuality, especially if they are obscure.

 In order for you to take a donation for used clothing, the IRS requires that the clothing be in at least good condition. While the IRS does not define what it considers “good condition,” you can look at definitions from charitable organizations that accept used items.


Salvation Army does not accept items that are torn, dirty, or broken.
Goodwill states that if you would be willing to give the item to a friend or relative then it is in good enough condition to donate.
If you donate a used item that is worth more than $500, then the IRS allows the item to be in less than good condition., The IRS also places limitation on the household items for which you can claim a charitable deduction. Like clothing, used household items must be in good or better condition to take a charitable deduction. In addition, you can only take deductions on the following household items:


Furniture and furnishings.
Electronics.
Appliances.
Linens, and other similar items.
Household items for purposes of charitable deductions do not include: food; paintings, antiques, and other objects of art; jewelry and gems, and collections.
 When choosing a valuation method for used clothing and household goods, you should consider using either the cost and selling price of the item or comparable sales price. Since used clothing and household goods are generally significantly lower than the price of new items, you should not use the replacement item value method. An easy way to help determine the selling price of your goods is to use a valuation table from a charitable organization.Charitable organizations, such as Goodwill or the Salvation Army, provide price lists for items that they sell in their stores. These lists can be used to calculate FMV for your donated items.

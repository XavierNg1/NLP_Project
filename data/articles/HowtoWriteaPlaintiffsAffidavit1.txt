 Plaintiffs use affidavits in a variety of circumstances, and there is no one definition of “plaintiff’s affidavit.” When you start a lawsuit, you may need to swear to the truth of certain facts. Affidavits are common in the following situations:


You are requesting child support. The parent who requests child support often needs to create an affidavit in which they provide financial information.
You are seeking an uncontested divorce. If you served your spouse with divorce papers but he or she didn’t respond, then you can often complete an affidavit and ask the court to give you a “default” divorce.You are filing a verified complaint. Generally, you start any kind of lawsuit by filing a “complaint.” Some courts require that you verify the facts in the complaint. You can do that by signing an affidavit.;
, Often, courts publish printed, “fill in the blank” affidavits you can use.These will make completing the affidavit easy. You should stop into the court and ask the clerk if a printed form is available.


Many courts also publish forms on their website. You can download these forms in PDF format and type in the requested information. You should check the court’s website to see if a form is available.
 Before beginning your lawsuit, you might want to schedule a consultation with an attorney to discuss any questions or concerns that you have. You can get a referral by contacting your local or state bar association.Call up the attorney and ask how much he or she charges.
Also ask if the attorney provides “unbundled legal services” (also called “limited scope representation”). Under this arrangement, the attorney will only do the work that you give him or her. For example, you could hire the attorney to look over your forms or to coach you about how to handle a court hearing. This is a good way to save on money.

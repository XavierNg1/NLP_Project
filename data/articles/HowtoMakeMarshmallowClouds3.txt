 Start preheating the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. While it's heating, mix the dry ingredients, minus the sugar. Add 3 cups of flour (600 grams), 2/3 cup of cocoa powder (200 grams), and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to a bowl, and stir to combine., Start with 1 cup of sugar (200 grams) and 1 cup of brown sugar (200 grams). Add in the cup of butter. Blend the mixture until it is light and fluffy. Add the eggs and extract and beat until they are well combined and fluffy.Creaming the butter and sugar together adds air to the cookies, making them lighter. If you cream these two ingredients until they are light and fluffy, you're actually creating more dough with the air you're incorporating., Dump the flour mixture and the chocolate chips into the wet ingredients. Using a low speed, begin to beat the mixture together. Keeping mixing until the ingredients are combined into a thick dough., Take a ball of dough, and use it to cover about 4 or 5 marshmallows. Form them back into balls with the marshmallows in the middle. They'll make fairly large balls, slightly bigger than a golf ball. Place them on a baking tray (no need to grease it). Leave about two inches of space between the balls., Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit until the cookies are browned and don't look glossy anymore. They can cool on the sheet for about 2 minutes, but you should move them after that to a cooling rack.

 Floral fabric is a nice choice. With such fabric, you can add two fabric flowers to one corner of the frame.
, Choose the size you need for the image you plan to slip into the frame. You'll need both a panel and a back plane; cut off the two patterns respectively.
 Draw the size of the photo frame with both the outer and inner frames drawn in. Also draw the diagonals in the inner frame.


Make sure each side of the outer frame is extended about 1.5 centimeter (0.6Â in) long.
 Cut the inner frame along the diagonals; leave the four angles uncut.



Fold the extended fabric of the outer frame to cover each side.
Add adhesive tape to three sides of the frame; leave one side to let the photo in.
 Use a rectangular piece of cardboard; slightly fold it at a quarter of the rectangle cardboard, then glue it to the back plane.
, Add your photo and put on display.

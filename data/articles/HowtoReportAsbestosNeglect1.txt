 If you notice dangerous asbestos in a building or site where you work, immediately notify the person in charge of the facility. Once notified, ask them about their plan of action to remedy the dangerous condition.If the asbestos is in your home, contact your Local Authority for guidance. Find your Local Authority at https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council.;
, If your employer has not remedied the dangerous condition after your notification, speak with your trade union's safety representative. As unions are large organizations with considerable bargaining power, they can often get the employer to remedy the condition., There are two ways to raise a concern with enforcement authorities with respect to asbestos neglect. If the asbestos is at a large or public facility, you'll report it to the Health and Safety Executive, or HSE. If the asbestos is in a smaller building or a private facility, you'll report it to your Local Authority.The HSE has jurisdiction over areas like mines, construction sites, hospitals and schools, factories, farms, and government facilities.
Local Authorities have jurisdiction over areas like homes, offices, pubs, churches, retailers, and hotels.
 The process of submitting a concern is simple. All you'll need is your own contact information, as much information about the dangerous condition as you can find, and information about who is causing the problem.


The HSE's form is located at http://webcommunities.hse.gov.uk/connect.ti/concernsform/answerQuestionnaire?qid=594147. You'll have to fill it out completely, but you aren't required to know the answer to every question.
If you're going to report it to your Local Authority instead, find your own at https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council. Once you provide your postcode, it will send you directly to the city government's webpage. You can report the violation from there.

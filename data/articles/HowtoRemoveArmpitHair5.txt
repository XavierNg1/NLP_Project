 If you're interested in electrolysis, it's important to go to a salon with a good reputation. Have an initial consultation so you can learn about the process and lay out a plan.


Electrolysis involves destroying individual hair follicles with chemical or heat energy for permanent hair removal.Make sure the salon uses needle electrolysis, which is the only permanent form of hair removal.
 The treatment will last fifteen minutes to one hour. Some people find the process painless, while others describe it as uncomfortable. Depending on how much hair you have, you may have to return for further sessions.
 Your skin will be red and swollen after your session, so you'll want to treat it gently. Apply aloe or another ointment recommended by the salon you visited.

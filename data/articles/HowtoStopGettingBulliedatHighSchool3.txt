 This can sometimes be difficult but is important for your own sanity. Don’t let him affect how you feel. Bullies generally want to know that they have control over your emotions. They absolutely don't, you do. Behave normally and don’t show fear. Act like his negative comments don’t affect you even if at first you are faking it.


React by using a sense of humor, saying something such as "I'm really glad you finally found something funny to say." This will throw the bully off guard and might change the direction of the interaction.
 Only you are responsible for yourself and your emotions. A good way to practice is by making a list of positive attributes and reflecting on them daily. Another way is by celebrating and rewarding yourself.


The more empowered you are and the more you can help yourself, the more likely you'll be able to stop the bully.
 Think of ways to feel at your best or strongest. Join a club or sport like track and field or drama. Get involved in school activities like yearbook or the school newspaper. You can perfect an existing talent or learn a new skill and make new friends in the process.

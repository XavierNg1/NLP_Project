 It doesn't need to be a very big knife, just as long as it has a pointed tip.
 Make a slice across the top of the orange to get started, then continue by rotating the orange in your hand while you use the knife to cut off the peel in one continuous motion.
 The knife should be facing towards you while you peel in a steady controlled manner, with a slight sawing motion. The orange skin should come off in one continuous, spiraled piece, about 1 inch (2.5Â cm) wide. Don't worry if a little of the fruit comes away with peel, you'll get better with practice.
 Once you have done this, it will be easy to peel the orange with your fingers. Just make sure you don't slice too deeply, or you will cut the fruit and get orange juice everywhere!

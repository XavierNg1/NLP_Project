 This is a simple method, requiring only that you know how to connect lines in a way that makes them appear three-dimensional. You can even do it on the computer if you so desire, and if you want them to stand out even more, you can try 3D block letters.;
, Calligraphy, the art of decorative handwriting using a pen and/or brush, can be difficult to master, but once you get there you're golden. If you already know calligraphy, you can still work on improving your calligraphy by writing short notes to yourself in calligraphy.
 To do this you'll need to practice your flourishes; every single letter must be elaborate. Make your script look extra realistic by doing it on parchment, or a scrap of paper you've burned at the edges.
 These are a little juvenile, but aesthetically pleasing nonetheless. Use them when doing lettering on cards and signs for kids.
 Incorporate designs you like and other types of lettering you've seen, including those above. Tagging is all about creativityâ€”just let the inspiration flow.

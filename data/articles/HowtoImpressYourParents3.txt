If there is a subject you are struggling with, ask your parents if they can help you.

Be aware that there may be subjects they don’t know enough about, or that they may not have time to help with. Don’t take this to mean they don’t care, instead, remember that they work hard to keep you happy and healthy.
 If you need additional help to maintain your grades, ask your teachers or see if tutoring is available. Some subjects can be challenging, so don’t be afraid to ask for help.
 Part of doing well in school means behaving well. Do as your teachers instruct, and this should be easy enough.


If you face pressure from peers to misbehave, do your best to ignore it. Eventually, they will learn that you do not cave in and leave you alone.
 If your school offers volunteer opportunities, sports teams, or band, consider if this might be something you would enjoy. Participating in things because you want to can create a lot of joy and pride for your parents.

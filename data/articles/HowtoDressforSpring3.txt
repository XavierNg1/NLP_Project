 Wind-breaker jackets are remarkably helpful during the first month or two of the season. They block out the chilly breezes of early spring, and also protect you from light rain. Just make sure you choose one with a hood.
 Trench coats are lightweight, making them suitable for spring weather. The belt that wraps around the waist of the coat flatters a range of figures, and trench coats that come in fun colors and patterns can give your outerwear personality.
 After all, springtime is known for its showers. A trench coat or wind-breaker may protect you from light sprinkles, but a raincoat is essential for stormy days.
 Lightweight, fitted cardigans are a nice way to dress up your top while keeping you warm and comfortable. Whites, creams, and pastel colors maintain a delicate, springtime image.
 Look for a fitted denim jacket without any interior insulation. The material is already heavy enough to keep you warm on chillier days, and may even prove too heavy once the weather starts warming up.

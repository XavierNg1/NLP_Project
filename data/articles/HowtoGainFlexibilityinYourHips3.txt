 Your right leg will be in front of you, bent with your foot parallel to your hip.
 The act of flexing this muscle will relax the hip flexor so it can be stretched. Place your hands on your right knee and keep your back straight.
 Push gently off your right knee with your arms and keep your back straight. Keep your knee behind or in line with the ankle. Hold the lunge stretch for 10 to 30 seconds., Bring the right knee in so that you are on your knees on the pillow, and then switch legs, bringing your left leg forward.
 Increase the duration of the stretch as your flexibility grows.

 You’ll need to watch your injury. If the pain is severe, or if your toe swells and has redness or warmth, go to the doctor.Make sure you have not developed an infection. Remember, it's better to be safe than sorry.If it is bleeding or draining, your toe needs to checked out by a medical professional
Don’t just rely on your friends for medical advice. Ask doctors, nurses and other specialists.
Some people have lost toes from untreated injuries, so it's better to be on the safe side.
It’s a good idea to always know the nearest route to the emergency room.
 If any medicine you took is not working in about an hour, you may need to get more help. You might have a more severe problem that requires medical attention. Remember, not all toe injuries can be treated at home.


Keep track of what medicines or methods you have tried on your toe so that if you go to the emergency room later on you know what to report to the doctors.
Always tell someone you trust if you are having strange symptoms from medicine.
 After you've tried distracting yourself or using physical methods like medicine or hot/cold to lessen the pain, check again to see you have an infection. See again if the toe is bleeding, draining, cold, numb, tingling, blue or grey. Remember that some injuries can get worse over time. It's not ok to just "fix" the problem and completely forget about it.


If you go to the urgent care or emergency room, be sure to bring a friend or family member.
Bring your insurance card, identification and wallet to the emergency room or urgent care center. If you are going alone, plan ahead how you will get back if you are unable to drive due to your sore toe.
Be sure to tell anyone at the doctor's office or emergency room if you have a bone sticking out or any unusual coloration.

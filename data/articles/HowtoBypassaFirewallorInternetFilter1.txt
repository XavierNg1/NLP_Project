 If your school or work IT department is any good, then these will be blocked/filtered. But it's easy to try to start.


If those proxies are blocked, just use a new proxy that firewalls don't know about yet. You can get them by joining a mailing list. For example, if you join a list like Circumventer (link below), they will send you fresh proxies daily, that hopefully your IT department isn't blocking yet.;
, Do a search for "free online proxies". This will provide you with a list of proxies to bypass filters, such as FrogTunnel or Vtunnel (requires JavaScript).
, Most sites have a checkbox that says "block scripts"; it is better to uncheck this.
 Go to Tools > Options > Connection Settings, and change the Proxy Settings to a proxy. Go to ask.com and search proxy lists.


If your school blocks a certain proxy, there is a way to access it. Get the URL via Google and then click on "cached." This will enable you display the page and use the proxy. Keep in mind that adaptive firewalls will catch you and permanently block the site. Another way to get around a firewall is to put spaces between letters when searching for sites.

 Before you can land your jump, you’ll first need to make the jump. Before you can do that, you’ll need to decide where you’re jumping.


For the sake of practice, it’s a good idea to start with level ground.
Mark a spot for your landing, or choose an already-marked spot. A basketball court is perfect for this.Stand about 30 inches from your landing spot.;
, You’ll be landing on the balls of your feet and might be tucking to roll, so prepare your body for those movements.


Face forward, directed straight at your landing target.
Your feet should be parallel, about shoulder-width apart.Align your body (legs over feet, shoulders over legs, standing straight).
 This prepares your body for the jump, giving you the spring load you need for momentum.
 It can help to bend your arms, holding them close to your body. This gives you more control as you move through the air., Point your toes, with your legs together.

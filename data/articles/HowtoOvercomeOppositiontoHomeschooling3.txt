 When parents have more direct interactions with their kids, the relationship between homeschooled kids and their parents can continue to grow and develop in a healthy way. Homeschooled kids and their parents report fewer problems even into the teen years, when most kids grow away from their parents and their relationship becomes more combative.
 Use this evidence to demonstrate that if more kids were homeschooled, we could have stronger communities.


Homeschooled children, when grown, are employed in political campaigns at higher rates than the general population.
When they reach voting age, 95% of adults who were homeschooled vote. Among the general population, however, just over 50% of Americans vote.
 You can also explain to your opposition that the more students are in the public school system, the higher the financial burden on the state.


Each school year, about $8,300 is allocated per student. In some districts, costs reach $25,000 per student. Homeschooled students, by contrast, require just $546 from the state per school year.
If someone argues that “Only rich people with lots of free time can homeschool their kids,” you might point out their error by reminding them that homeschooling actually requires less time than does traditional schooling for both parents (who don’t have to drive their kids to and from school, review teacher feedback, attend parent-teacher conferences, or fill out permission slips) and students (who often spend most of their education studying independently, and may spend as little as one hour each day with an actual instructor).You could go on to explain that homeschooling can easily be done on a budget, and parents of homeschooled kids can have fulfilling careers working from home as artists, writers, and web developers.

 In this case, we can see that 27 and 12 are both divisible by 3, so we'll separate that out:27x2 - 12 = 3(9x2 - 4)

, To use this method you should be able to take the square root of the terms evenly. (Notice that we'll have left out the negative signs - since these numbers are squares they may be products of positive or two negative numbers)9x2 = 3x * 3x and 4 = 2 * 2

, We'll take the a and c values from our step above - a = 9 and c = 4, then find their square roots - √a = 3 and √c = 2. These are the coefficients for the factor expressions:27x2 - 12 = 3(9x2 - 4) = 3(3x + 2)(3x - 2)

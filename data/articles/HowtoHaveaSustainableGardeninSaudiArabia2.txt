 Consider sharing with neighbors who may also want to grow food, especially if you need to negotiate to get the rooftop space.
 Good containers include large plastic bottles used for large amounts of water or oil (6 liter/4 gallon), coffee cans and terracotta flowerpots.
 Add some compost to the soil to improve its quality.
 You might have a mixture of both ornamental plants (flowers, ferns, etc.) and edible plants (vegetables and fruit). This will depend on how much rooftop space you have. Some suggestions include:


Geraniums and scented pelargoniums

Eggplant (aubergine)

Okra (ladyfinger)

Potatoes (these can be grown in potato bags)
Herbs (such as basil, thyme, oregano, etc.)
Spices such as chili plants
Salad vegetables such as lettuce, tomatoes and baby spinach
Marigolds
Annual flowers.
Vine plants (grapes, beans, etc.).
 Set up sail sheets, tarpaulins or similar covers for plants that need cover. Or, shift the containers to a wall that gets more shade.
 Use a watering can or other container to bring water to the plants. Don't leave it too long between watering, especially on very hot days.

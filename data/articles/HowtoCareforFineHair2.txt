 If you generally use styling product when doing your hair, pick a mousse or styling spray. Mousse and spray products are lightweight, while creams or serums will weigh down your hair, making it look limp. Try to pick a mousse or spray that is volumizing.Use an oil-free product, especially if your hair is oily as well as fine.
Don’t use too much product. Even lightweight formulas can weigh down hair when used excessively.
 Heat stylers like curling irons or straightening irons can cause damage to any hair type, but they are particularly harsh on fine hair. It’s best for your hair not to use irons at all, but if they are an important part of your beauty routine, use a heat protective spray before using heat tools. Heat protective sprays coat the strands of your hair so that they are not damaged by the heat of the iron.
 Always start with the lowest setting on your hair iron or dryer. Since heat is damaging to delicate, fine hair, always start off with the lowest heat setting when using a dryer or iron. Increase the heat gradually if the cooler setting does not have the desired effect.Letting you hair dry whenever is possible is best for dry hair.
 People with flat, fine hair often notice that their hair gets oily very quickly. Dry shampoo is a great remedy because it acts as a powder that absorbs excess grease and oil. To use, dust a small amount on the scalp. Then use your fingers to work it over the oily areas of your hair.Don’t use dry shampoo as a stand in for regular shampoo. Instead use it occasionally for touch ups.
 Try to only brush or comb your hair when it’s dry. Because your hair is more fragile when wet, brushing wet hair can be stressful to your hair. Therefore, try to brush your hair when it is dry and use a wide toothed comb or a bristle brush to be extra gentle.

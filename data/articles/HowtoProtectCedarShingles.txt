Organic matter like branches and leaves that lie on cedar for a long time can grow mold and mildew, which will in turn seep in the cedar and cause its quality to deteriorate. Clear the shingles approximately every 2 weeks, and remember to remove any debris after rainstorms.;

Moisture from inside a building can also damage cedar. Places to keep an eye on include attics and any structures that hold water.



Power washing attacks smaller debris that can harm cedar. When power washing, be sure to use a low pressure that will not damage the wood. Increase the frequency of your power washing if your cedar collects lots of debris throughout the year.

Bleaching oil is the traditional coating for cedar shingles and is effective at protecting against moisture, mold, and mildew. It adds a gray color to the wood.
Clear coat solutions are designed to protect the wood while enhancing or altering its original hues. Many varieties, differing in color, are available.
Use a sprayer or paint brush to apply the treatment. Make sure your coating is even.

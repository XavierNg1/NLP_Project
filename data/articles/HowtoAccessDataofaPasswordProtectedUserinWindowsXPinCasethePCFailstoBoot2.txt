 Restart Computer and change the Boot Settings to read from Optical Drive before the HDD. Then Insert the "Ubuntu Live CD" (free open source download) and Restart the Computer.;
, Run "Ubuntu Live" without installing Ubuntu onto the Hard Disc., Access the Windows Files on the HDD using the Ubuntu operating system., Scavenge through important Files, Documents, and possibly other External Drive Sources., Save all important files and documents onto a safe external device or burn them to a disc, if you have more than one drive., Restart the Computer, change Boot Settings back to Read HDD first again.
 Reformat your HDD using Windows Setup Disc. Or, "FDisc" if you have no Windows Disc (also free open source download).
 This should solve the problem.

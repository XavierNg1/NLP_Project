 Heat may break down the chemicals already applied, undermining their residual effect. As a general rule, apply chemicals after steaming.;
, This will increase the effectiveness of the steamer. If possible, use a vacuum cleaner with a bag, as this allows for easy disposal of any bed bugs that may have been captured in the vacuum. If you have a bagless vacuum cleaner, dispose of all contents in a bag outside of your house, place the bag straight into the outdoor garbage, then wash the vacuum container and filter in as hot water as the vacuum components can stand. Allow to air dry before refitting to the vacuum cleaner.


Another option is to use a steamer/vacuum combination.
 Remember that steamers produce extremely hot steam, so use caution to avoid burning yourself.
 Do this both when the steamer heats up initially and when moving between locations. Once the water is purged, you can attach the appropriate accessory and begin steaming.


Keep a dry towel or moisture-absorbent cloth on hand to help absorb excess water that may accumulate while steaming.
 and work your way down to the floorboards. The steamer can be used on moldings, mattresses, box springs, headboards, sofas, carpeting, floorboards and more. However, never steam into an electrical outlet or appliances!

, Some steamers have a pressure control valve, allowing you to control the pressure of the steam.
 Keep the tip of the nozzle about one to two inches (2.5cm-5cm) from the surface you are treating, and move at a rate of about one inch (2.5cm) per second.
 Applying encasements before the steam has dried may result in the growth of mold.
 If signs of bed bugs appear, re-treat the area with steam. It is always recommended to follow up a steam treatment with an EPA-approved bed bug spray.

 Parrots are known to hide any pain or discomfort they may be feeling. As a result, you may not become aware of a problem until it is quite advanced. The best way to prevent disease and keep your parrot healthy is to visit your vet every 6 to 12 months for a routine check-up.At this visit, your vet will:

Examine your African Grey
Weigh your parrot
Provide any necessary vaccinations
Perform a series of tests

, When you go in for your visit, your vet should draw blood from your parrot and perform a series of tests. Blood tests can screen for a number of diseases, as well as any problems with organ function (which can occur as a result of chronic aspergillosis)., During your routine well-care visit, you should also make sure your vet performs a fecal exam. These exams can screen for any yeast or bacterial infections, which can cause respiratory problems.Your vet may ask you to bring in a stool sample.

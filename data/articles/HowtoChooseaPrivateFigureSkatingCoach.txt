 Do you want to compete? Do you want to just skate for recreational purposes? Heck, do you want to go to the Olympics? Share this info with some potential coaches and see which one is the most interested.

Some coaches won't teach you if you are not interested in competing. Figure out how extreme of a skater you want to be.
Also think about what type of figure skating you want to do. Ice dancing, freestyle, pairs, different coaches are needed for progressing in different areas.

, I'm not talking about some major background info, but find out enough to know at least a little about them. During an interview, ask some of these questions: How long have you been coaching? How long and where did you skate before you decided to coach? What major skating accomplishments have you achieved? What is your skating philosophy? How many students do you teach? Any references? Write this info down or make a mental note of it.
 Most coaches charge $25-$45 every 1/2 hour. An hour can range from $60-$75.

Figure out how much time you need with your teacher. If you are a beginner maybe only once a week for 1/2 an hour. More serious skating means more ice time.
 Observe the techniques he/she uses to teach and also watch the skaters.

Some coaches use strict, demanding techniques, while others try to be more relaxed and lighthearted in their lessons.
 Ask the skater(s) and their parents how the coach is. Find out how the coach behaves and teaches from these sources.
 Does she/he want them to go to the Olympics or just try their best? Does he expect them to come in every single day and not fall once or learn from the mistakes? Compare this to how you want your son or daughter to do and what you expect from them.
 Make sure that the three have the same goals, expectations, etc.

Make sure your kid really wants to skate. If the kid wants to do this just for fun and the coach is very strict about sticking with skating, it might not be a good match.

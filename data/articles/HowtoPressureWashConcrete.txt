 A gas or electric washer with a pressure rating of at least 3,000 PSI, and a flow rate of at least 4 gallons (15.1 L) per minute, will effectively clean exterior concrete. Set the spray nozzle to high pressure and use a 40-inch spray tip. Add an appropriate cleaning solution to the reservoir.;
, You must know if the concrete is badly stained, a blast of water won’t be able to get rid of problem areas. Apply a de-greasing agent, bleach or detergent first (depending on the type of stain) and scrub the stain. Allow the applied cleaner to sit for sometime even after scrubbing and then you may pressure wash it., Proper preparation is the key to a successful concrete cleaning experience. It will make the job quicker and easier for the do-it-yourselfer.


Remove any obstacles or large debris from the cleaning area. You will need to temporarily relocate any patio furniture, planters, etc.
Dampen and cover nearby plants or gardens to protect them from the high pressure spray and cleaning chemicals. You can use any non-porous cover such as a tarp or plastic tablecloth.
Cover all exposed outlets or electrical wires. If outlet covers do not exist, seal them with plastic and water-proof tape.
Remove dense areas of oil or grease with tri-sodium phosphate (TSP). Apply the product per the manufacturer's instructions and be careful to follow all safety precautions.
 You may increase or decrease the power of the spray by adjusting either the nozzle setting or the distance at which you are holding the wand from the concrete.
 This will ensure that there are no uneven streaks in the concrete once it dries. Follow the slope of the concrete to optimize proper draining and run-off.

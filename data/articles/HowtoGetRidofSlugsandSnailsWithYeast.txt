 The jar must be deep enough to keep the slugs and snails from crawling out. You can also buy containers (traps) designed specifically for this purpose at garden supply stores.A suggested mixture is two cups of warm water, a packet of dry yeast, and one teaspoonful each of salt and sugar. The salt will help ensure that the slugs and snails die before they have a chance to escape. If you're going to dump the slugs and/or mixture in your garden or compost pile, skip the salt; it'll make your soil too salty., This is best done in the vegetable patch or other garden space where the slugs and snails are patrolling.
 Put these traps throughout your garden at intervals of six to eight feet, since the yeast won't draw them in from any further than that.
 They will have crawled into the jar and drowned. You can leave them in the garden to decompose and contribute to the organic matter of the soil, or put them in a compost pile (either way, crushing them will hasten the process, if you are not squeamish about doing so).
 It will be impacted by rain and evaporation, so top it up as needed.

,, From the drop-down menu that appears, select "Add-ons" and wait for the "Add-ons Manager Tab" to appear.
 Extensions are a common type of add-on that bring additional features to your browser (for example pop-up blocking, games, and communication apps).


To remove a theme (a type of add-on that changes the colors and/or background of your browser), select “Appearance” instead of “Extensions.” The rest of the steps will be the same.
To remove a third-party plugin like Flash or Java, select “Plugins”, then change “Always Activate” to “Never Activate”. Plugins provide support for viewing certain types of Internet content like music, video, and animations.
 If you’re experiencing slowness or unexpected behavior from your web browser, it could be due to a buggy or incompatible add-on. Disabling add-ons can help you determine which add-on is causing these issues.


When you click “Disable”, the button text will change to “Enable,” which allows you to re-enable the extension later.
 This option will permanently delete the extension and its associated files from your computer.


Use “Remove” if you’ve determined that a specific add-on negatively impacts your web browsing.
You can download an extension you’ve removed later by clicking “Get Add-ons” in the Add-on Manager.
If the “Remove” button is grayed out, click the ☰ menu, select the “?” symbol, then select “Restart with Add-ons Disabled.”Choose “Start in Safe Mode” from the menu. When you return to the Add-ons menu, should now be able to click “Remove” next to your desired Add-on.
 Whether your chose “Disable” or “Remove,” you’ll see an option that says “Restart Now.” Once clicked, the browser will restart with the extension disabled or removed.

 In the cleaning section of most stores, you should be able to find a "hospital grade" disinfectant. This will be more effective against a wide range of bacteria than other disinfectants. In many cases, you'll find this sold in concentrated form and will have to dilute it.


If hospital grade disinfectant is not available, you could use a mixture that is 80% ethanol, 5% isopropanol, and 15% distilled water., If your disinfectant came ready to use, you won't have to dilute it, but in many cases you'll have to add distilled water to the concentrated solution. The amount you'll have to dilute your solution will vary between products, so you should consult the directions on your disinfectant for best results.


On the label of your disinfectant, there should be various suggested amounts for diluting. Use these to determine the amount you need to dilute your disinfectant.
Impurities or additives, like fluoride, in your tap water can negatively impact the strength of your disinfectant. For this reason, you should only dilute with distilled water., The disinfectant you'll be using will be very strong, so plastic containers might not hold up well to it. However, a simple glass container, like a cup, can be used for your disinfectant.


Your disinfectant should be high enough in the glass to completely submerge the used part of the clippers., Different formulas of disinfectant may take less time than others to work. To guarantee your clippers are fully disinfected, soak them for full time indicated on the label of your disinfectant.


After your clippers finish soaking, you can wipe away excess moisture with a clean, dry cloth or a piece of paper towel, or allow them to air dry. Your clippers are ready to clip!

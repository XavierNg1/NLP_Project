 Once you've become an expert at the game you can add your own rules to enhance it.


Make it a rule that the Shark can only tag Minnows who have their head above water.It’s fun to challenge yourself but never put your life in danger. Be cautious and make sure swimmers can make it from one side of the pool to the other in one breath.
 Add more Sharks so the Minnows have to swim faster and be more creative to get to the other side without being tagged.
 Instead of Sharks and Minnows, you can use Cat and Mouse, Cheetah and Gazelle, or Fox and Rabbit. , If you don't have access to a pool, or if the pool is too crowded to play, move to a field or gym. This version is played year-round and can usually accommodate more players. Make sure to swap your swim trunks for sneakers.


Cones, tape, or basketball court lines are used to mark the boundaries. These will be the spots where players will start and end.If you want to minimize contact, you can have players tuck a towel into their shorts, to act as a “tail.” Instead of tagging players, the Shark will pull their tail., Have the Shark close their eyes or turn their back until they hear a Minnow swimming. They must tag players by following their sounds.


In this version, Minnows can exit the pool and try to walk to the other end of the pool without being seen or heard. If the Shark does hear them then the Shark will yell, "fish out of water" and the Minnow must start over., Place pool floats around the pool. If a player bumps into one, send them back to the beginning or make them sit through a time out.
 In this version, instead of becoming Sharks when tagged, players become seaweed. They must stay still and can only reach as far as arm's length to tag other Minnows who then become seaweed as well.If a seaweed touches a Shark, it turns back into a Minnow and can continue swimming to the end of the pool.

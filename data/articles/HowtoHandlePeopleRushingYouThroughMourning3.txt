 If there is someone else who shares the same loss, seek refuge in their company. This can be especially helpful when others try to tell you that your mourning is taking too long. Turning to someone else who is struggling to adjust can provide you with relief and companionship.For instance, if you lost a child, it may help to spend time with a spouse, co-parent, or another sibling who is also suffering the loss. Together, you can walk down memory lane. Recall funny stories about the deceased. Look at pictures or artwork. Lean on each otherâ€™s shoulders when you need to cry.
 Although members of a bereavement support group may not intimately know your loss, they may be feeling similarly. Participating in a support group can give you consolation when others in your life are pressuring you to speed up your grieving.


You can talk to your grief counselor for suggestions about support groups in your area, or you can search online for supportive communities.You may be able to find a support group at a local church, at a mental health clinic, or by contacting a social worker at a hospital.
 If you believe in a higher power, it can help to lean into your spirituality as you grieve. Many people find that their spirituality is a major source of comfort and support as they navigate the aftermath of a major loss.


Depending on what spirituality means to you, you might find consolation through walking in nature, attending religious services, volunteering and helping others, praying or meditating, seeking spiritual counsel, or reading a sacred book.

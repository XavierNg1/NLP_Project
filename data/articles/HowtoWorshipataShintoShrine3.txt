 Now that you’ve been purified, you’re ready to commune with the gods of the shrine. This is done at the offering hall (haiden), which is located just before the main shrine building. The haiden usually has a simple roof with a large wooden offering box (saisenbako) underneath.You’ll be able to easily identify the offering box by the wooden slats in its top. These allow money offered to the gods to fall down into the box.
 Walk up to the offering box and quietly toss in a coin as an offering. A 100-yen coin is a typical offering, but you may offer more or less if you wish.Consider using a 5- or 50-yen coin as an offering. These coins are associated with good luck, especially in relationships.The amount of money you offer at a shrine is less important than your intention. If you meet the gods with a pure heart, your offering will be appreciated.
 If there is a bell at the haiden, give its rope a single, firm shake to call the gods to hear your prayer. After this is done, show your reverence to the gods with two deep bows. At some shrines, there may be a gong in place of a bell. In these situations, the gong is usually used in the same fashion as the bell – to call the gods to the shrine.Each bow should be at a 90° angle, so you’re bending in half at the waist. Take your time when bowing; rushing can be a sign of disrespect.
 Pray whatever is on your heart freely, but do so without speaking out loud. Express your gratitude wordlessly to the gods for listening to your prayer. When your prayer is finished, clap twice.Your claps should be unhurried and of moderate volume. This shows the gods your respect and also your happiness at meeting them., After expressing your respect and happiness with claps, you’ll need to bow once more to respectfully excuse yourself from the presence of the gods. Bow in the same fashion you did earlier and leave the haiden.

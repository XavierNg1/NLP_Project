 When exiting a conversation with a potential connection, let them know you'd like to meet later on. Pass them your e-mail or phone number and suggest a time and place to meet.For example, "I have to run now, but are you free for coffee Tuesday? I'd love to continue this conversation."

, If you're more introverted, face to face interactions can be stressful. After meeting someone in person, nurture your relationship online. Add connections through Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. You can work on communicating via these platforms to strengthen connections.If your Twitter and Facebook are more personal than professional, you may want to stick to interacting via social media platforms like LinkedIn.
 Networking gets easier with practice. Push yourself out of comfort zone a little each day. For example, challenge yourself to e-mail three contacts in one day. The next day, challenge yourself to meet a colleague for lunch. With a little courage, you'll eventually get comfortable networking despite your introverted nature.

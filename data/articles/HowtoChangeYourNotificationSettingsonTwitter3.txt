 Follow these steps if you want to change the e-mails that Twitter sends you.
 If you're not already logged in, enter your username and password into the fields provided. Then, sign in.
 It's located in the upper-right region of the window. When you click on it, a menu will appear.
 This will take you to a page where you can control your account settings.
 The menu that appears lists all of the different ways in which Twitter can contact you via e-mail.
 Look for a button at the top of the list of e-mail items that reads either "Turn on" or "Turn off." Clicking this button will enable or disable Twitter from sending you any and all e-mails whenever relevant activity happens in your network.
 If you'd like to receive notifications for certain types of activity, click the individual check boxes next to each notification item to disallow e-mails about that particular notification from being sent to you.









If the checkboxes and options are grayed out, that means you have disabled e-mail and you must click the "Turn on" button at the top-right portion of the list of items.

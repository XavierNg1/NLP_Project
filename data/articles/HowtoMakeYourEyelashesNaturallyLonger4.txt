 Research suggests that green tea may improve hair growth. A study done on rodents who drank the tea for 6 months showed significant hair growth in previously bald patches.Green tea can also stimulate growth and soften hair when applied topically (directly to the skin/hair)., Many DIY beauty fans and alternative health practitioners claim that aloe vera gel promotes lash growth, but this has not been proven by science. To give it a try, apply the gel to your lashes with a cotton swab, a mascara wand, or your fingers.


You can take the gel directly from the plant (by squeezing it out from the leaves), or you can use aloe vera gel, which is available at most drugstores. This is particularly nice to use in the summer months in place of oil.
 Research has shown that garlic can aid hair growth. One study showed that patients who applied a topical garlic treatment to bald patches saw results within 2 to 4 weeks.Garlic pills are available at most health food stores, and many pharmacies. Garlic creams or gels may be more difficult to find, so ask your doctor or dermatologist if you cannot easily find them at a pharmacy.Do not apply actual garlic to your eyelashes, as this will cause irritation, not to mention it will make you smell like garlic.

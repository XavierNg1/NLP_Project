When you start the dribble you want to push the ball out in front of you to get a quick start.
Be sure not to push it out too far or the ball will get stolen.
 Then pick the ball up as you are planting your right foot.


This should take anywhere from 1-3 dribbles depending on skill level. 3 at the max.
Traveling is taking more than 2 steps without dribbling the ball so make sure you pick the ball up as you plant your right foot about 3-5 feet from the basket.



Your left foot is going to be the foot you jump off of, like a normal right handed layup on the right side.
, Move as if they are connected with a string from your elbow to your knee.
 There, put the ball off the glass and into the basket.


You want to aim in the middle of the square not the left side.

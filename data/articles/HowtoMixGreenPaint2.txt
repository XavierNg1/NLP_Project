 Start with one part yellow and one part blue and mix the two colors together with a pallet knife. Once you have your green, add one extra part yellow and mix again. Keep adding yellow until you get the shade you want.


Two to three parts yellow and one part blue will give you a bright, lime green.
 Adding white will also give you more of a minty green. Keep in mind that some whites can be very vibrant. Start with less white than you think you might need.
 Start with a basic green color, then mix in one extra part blue. Keep adding blue paint until you get the color you want.


Two parts blue and one part yellow will give you turquoise.
 Keep adding the black paint, drop by drop, and mixing, until you get the color you want.
 If you want more of an olive green or an army green, add a drop of red. The more red you add, the more earthy your shade of green.

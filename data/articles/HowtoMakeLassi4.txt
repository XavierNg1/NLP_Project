 For a savory flavor, mix in 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, ground turmeric, or masala powder.This works best when added to the traditional salty lassi. For a flavorful addition to the traditional sweet lassi, add 1/2 teaspoon of ground cardamom powder or ginger, for some kick.
 Start with a traditional sweet lassi and blend in some of your favorite fruits. Consider mixing in strawberries, papaya, bananas, or coconut.Try chopping and freezing the fruit before blending it into the lassi. This will make your drink colder and frothier.
 While most lassi drinks are yogurt based, you can swap out the yogurt and water or milk for coconut milk. This will give a slightly tropical flavor to the drink. Or you could flavor the lassi with rose water syrup, vanilla extract, or honey.Don't choose too many flavors or they could make the drink too sweet. If you stick to one or two flavors, they'll be more pronounced.
 Top your lassi with any of the following for extra flavor and a more polished look:


chopped pistachios
sprigs of mint
sprinkle of turmeric or cumin
chopped almonds
fruit sliver

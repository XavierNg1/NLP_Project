 Make it a habit to keep a notepad so that you can jot down different experiences you have while you travel. This will make it easier to remember experiences that you can later use in your stories. Jot down the most important points of the story rather than trying to chronicle all the details during your travels.You can also take photos or video of your experiences to help you remember them, or you can even integrate them into the telling of your story.;
, A natural way to start telling a story is to relate it to your current experience. For instance, if you're at a Mexican restaurant with your friends, you can talk about your travel experience in Mexico. Relating it to what you're currently doing and making it relevant will cause people to be more interested.It will also help create banter between the people that you're sharing the story with.
 The more out of the ordinary your story is, the more memorable and entertaining it will be for people. Avoid mundane stories with no moral or point. Instead, choose a story that is unique in order to pique their interest. Don't be afraid to slightly exaggerate to make your story more interesting.If your story isn't extraordinary in any way, you can weave humor into it to keep it interesting.
 When you are telling a story, make sure that it's one that's fresh in your memory. If you have to stop to try to remember details or large plot points in the story, it can break up the story's flow, and people could lose interest. Choose a story about a recent trip or something that was so memorable that you could never forget the details.

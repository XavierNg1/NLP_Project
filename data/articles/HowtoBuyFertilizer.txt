 While test kits are available online and at garden stores, you will get the most accurate results if you contact your county agricultural extension agent.;

Measure the length of the garden, lawn or flower bed. Multiply that number by 2.
Measure the width of the growing area. Multiply that number by 2.
Add the numbers together.
If the area is less than 1,000 square feet (92.9 square meters), divide it by 1,000 (92.9) to get a decimal to use for calculating the amount of fertilizer you will need. For example, if your garden is 680 square feet (63.17 square meters), your multiplier will be .680.
If you are planning to fertilize a lawn interrupted by several flower beds, calculate the area of the beds and subtract that from the area calculation for the lawn.
 Have this information on hand when you go to the garden shop to help you process how to buy fertilizer more readily.


Plants with dense foliage generally benefit from higher levels of nitrogen, which helps grow greener leaves by encouraging the production of chlorophyll. Because nitrogen leeches from the soil easily, you may need to apply it more frequently than other components.
Plants producing fruits or seeds, like vegetables or berry plants, will require more phosphorus and potash. Phosphorus supports the development of a strong root system, while potash helps plants tolerate weather stress and resist disease.
Flowering plants may benefit from the addition of phosphorus, which also helps to strengthen plant stems and encourage heavier blooming.
 For example, if your test results recommend 2 lbs.(.9 kg) of potash per 1,000 square feet (92.9 square meters), you would multiply .680 x 2, to determine that you will need 1.36 lbs. (.6 kg) for your garden.

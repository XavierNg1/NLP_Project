 The first step to texting is to figure out what everything means. Sometimes people will just type the letters in a phrase to shorten their message. Some basic phrases are Idk (I don't know), ttyl (talk to you later), and gtg (got to go). Knowing these are very important if you want to become an expert in texting.;
, The most important part of texting is knowing who to text! The best people to text are your friends because you'll always know what to say and they'll keep you up to date on the latest news and gossip. Plus, you can talk about anything with them!

, Now for the main event! On most phones, you have an option for Messaging. Go into that and select New Message. Choose the type of message you want to send and who you want to send it to. Now, start typing away! When you're finished, press Send. It's that easy!

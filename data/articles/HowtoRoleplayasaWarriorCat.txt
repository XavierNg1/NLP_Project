 Currently, there are six different parts to the Warriors Saga. They are Warriors, The New Prophecy, The Power of Three, Omen of the Stars, Dawn of the Clans and A Vision of Shadows. Also, there are Warriors Mangas, and books like "Firestar's Quest", "Cats of the Clans", "Bluestar's Prophecy" and "Warriors Field guide". Only the first 6 books (The new prophecy: Into the wild, Fire and ice, Forest of secrets, Rising storm, A dangerous path and The darkest hour.) are essential to start your own role play though, so at least read those to get a basic understanding of the Warriors life.;
, There should be at least four clans in the forest. Choose names for your clans like MistClan, ForestClan, DarkClan, RippleClan, SpeedClan or LightClan. Don't choose names like EgyptianClan or BookClan.
 Think of your roleplay name first, and then think of your leader's, deputy's, and others.
 Include things like Fourtrees, Twolegplace, or Treecutplace. You could also make specific landmarks such as Sunningrocks, Moonpool, Highrocks, and other things the cats would call something.
 Enlist a friend, tell them to read the books, give them a name, age, and status, and explain to them their territory, landmarks, and any other important things.
 It is good to start off as a kit or apprentice so you can have experience through playing the game. If you are an apprentice, pick your mentor, and then go on training missions.
, You should go outside and "hunt" then coming back in and drop something on your honorary "fresh-kill pile" and eat something, referring to it as fresh-kill.
 You can roleplay outside if it's warm, or roleplay inside if it's cold. Get a box or a large pile of rocks and declare it as your highrocks. Set up tents, or some other form of make-shift shelter and declare those as your dens. Lastly, make a fresh-kill pile (This can be a large plate or aluminum foil) and set food on it.
 Make people think you're just crazy as you go through these.

 Before you make flageolet beans in cream, you will need to soak the beans. Put the beans in a large bowl and cover with 1 inch of water. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Soak overnight, or for at least 8 hours., Place the beans in a strainer after you have soaked them overnight. Run cool, clean water over the beans. Lightly agitate the strainer after rinsing the beans. This will help drain any remaining water and debris., Place the beans, water, carrot, onion, and cloves in the kettle. Then tie the celery, parsley, and bay leaf into a bundle with cooking twine and place in the kettle. Finally, add the thyme, salt, and pepper., Bring the beans to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover the kettle with a lid. Reduce the heat to low or medium-low and allow the beans to simmer for about 2 hours or until the beans are tender when pierced with a fork., Once the beans are tender, turn off the stove. Use a fork or tongs to remove the bay leaf, parsley, onion, and celery from the kettle. Discard these ingredients in the trash or compost., After you have discarded the other vegetables and herbs, use a fork or tongs to remove the carrot from the kettle. Chop the carrot into small cubes. Set the chopped carrot aside., You will need about half a cup of the cooking liquid to make the cream sauce. Take a ½ cup-sized measuring cup and dip it into the liquid. Set aside ½ cup of the cooking liquid., Carefully drain the beans in a large strainer. Be careful you do not burn yourself as the beans will be very hot. If possible, ask a friend or family member to help you dump the beans into a strainer so they can drain., Heat the butter in a large skillet and then add the shallots and garlic. Cook the garlic and shallots for about one minute while stirring. Add the beans, chopped parsley, diced carrot, and cream. Simmer for 5 minutes and serve.

 You should hold it in your non-dominant hand. Make sure to hold it with the shiny side down.


One end of the sheet should be in your palm, with the opposite end extending up past your fingers.
 Dip your hand in water mixed with rice vinegar to keep the rice from sticking. Spread the rice so that it covers the bottom third of the nori sheet.You should aim to use about 1/2 cup of rice per roll.
 Place your ingredients into the indentation, and don’t overstuff it or you’ll have a difficult time rolling it up later. Some of the more popular combinations for hand rolls:


Spicy tuna roll: Chopped tuna, mayonnaise, chili sauce, cucumber, carrot
Rock ‘n Roll: eel, cream cheese, avocado
Tamago roll: pan-fried rolled omelet, lettuce, avocado.
 Lift the bottom corner of the nori, and fold it over the ingredients, creating a cone shape. Continue rolling, making sure that the roll is tight as possible.


Press several single grains of rice into the bare end of the nori. These will act as "glue" as the sushi forms a roll.
You do not need to cut hand rolls. Dip the corner that you are planning to eat in the soy sauce, instead of pouring soy sauce on the whole thing. This will keep it from falling apart.

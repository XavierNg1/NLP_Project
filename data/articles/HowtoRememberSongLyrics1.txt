 When you sing along with an artist, you rely on their vocal cues to lead you from one verse to the next. This crutch prevents you from learning and retaining the lyrics.This becomes problematic when you perform live and the cues are gone. One way to overcome this obstacle and memorize the lyrics is to sing along with the original track (on which the artist is singing) and the backing (instrumental) track. Ideally, the two tracks you download will be the same version of the song., While you’re driving around town or working around the house, turn on the original track. Sing the first section of the song with the artist. Press pause.
 Switch to the backing track. Sing the same section of the song without the artist’s cues. Press pause. Take a moment to assess how well you know the lyrics. If you nailed every word, move on to the next section. If you fumbled your way through the section, continue switching back and forth between the two tracks until you have learned and retained the lyrics. Once you are comfortable with a section, move on to the next. Continue this process until you have learned the entire song.

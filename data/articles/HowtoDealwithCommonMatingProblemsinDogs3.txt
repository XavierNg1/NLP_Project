 Before you decide to allow your dog to mate, you should seriously consider the ethical implications. It is important to understand that there is an overpopulation of dogs, and that every day dogs are euthanized. Instead of producing puppies, consider adopting a shelter dog., If you breed your dog, you should embrace the philosophy of “breed to improve.” This means that you should examine your dog carefully and note its flaws. Then, you should choose a mater that can either balance or entirely eliminate those flaws in offspring.For example, if your dog suffers from arthritis, you should breed her with a dog that does not have arthritis.
If your dog suffers from a breed-specific health problem, such as hip dysplasia, try breeding him with a mate who does not suffer from the same ailment.
 If you choose to breed your dog, you should make an effort to cooperate with other breeders in geographic regions other than your own. This will help facilitate the movement of genes within a breed between locales. This is especially important if you are dealing with a breed whose population is small.For example, you should not breed your dog with a dog that lives in your town. If possible try to make connections with a breeder in another part of your state or country.
Make sure you ask for the genealogical history of any dog you choose to mate with your dog. This can ensure that you are not breeding your dog with a distant (or close!) relative.

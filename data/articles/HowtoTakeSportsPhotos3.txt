 If you are able to be down close to the action, get to the event ahead of time and find the spots where you’ll have the best view of the playing area. Try to find a place where you can move around, crouch, and maybe even lay down. You want to pick a safe place where you won’t end up getting hit by the players.The coaches, officials, or other game authorities may restrict where you can stand, which is important to find out ahead of time as well.
If there are going to be other photographers at the game, getting there early will ensure you don’t lose a great spot to someone else.
Go to more sports games to take pictures, even if you don’t have a specific reason for being there. You’ll get practice but the stakes are lower.
 Great shots pass in a moment, so always be looking ahead of the action to where the action is moving. Learn the game well so you can tell when big plays are about to happen. You won’t have time to react if a great shot reveals itself, so always be ready.For example, when shooting a football game, watch for the quarterback to cock the football back as he prepares to pass. Or in baseball, watch as a runner nears second base as he may be about to slide.
If you have kids, take photos of them playing in the yard, watching for specific moments of action that would make good photos.
 Don’t focus all of your attention on close-ups of the players, because the game is more than that. Catch photos of the coaches on the sidelines or the crowd reacting to a big play. Take wide shots that show the pitcher’s reaction to a home run hit. All of the extras add drama to the shot.In between plays is a great time to get shots of the packed stadium, the many players on the sidelines, or the players on the field when they are resting. Don’t ignore a shot just because it isn’t action packed.
Sometimes when you take an up close photo of a player, you lose the context of what is happening around them.

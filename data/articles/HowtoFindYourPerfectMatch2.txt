 Feel free to express your true opinions and personality. If your suitor sticks around, your company was found truly enjoyable. If another date doesn't come about, you may feel rejected, but this proves that you were just not meant to be. Being honest and being true to yourself can help you avoid wasting time while dating.


Furthermore, acting the way you think your suitor wants you to act rather than being yourself can foster feelings of resentment, stress, and discomfort. These feelings do not set a solid foundation for a relationship., You might find someone there who shares the interests and more! This event and the commonalities you have will create easy talking points, and might lead to a first date.


If you love literature and art, join a book club or get active in the artistic community.
If you love to cook, take a cooking class and whip up conversation with a fellow chef.
Even if you don’t connect with anyone, you’re still doing something you love.
 Your suitor may not fit the ideal picture you had in mind, but if it feels right, pay attention to that. On the contrary, if there's anything that is disturbing to you, don't ignore the signs.


Your unconscious mind responds to situations that reflect your goals (in this case being romance), so it’s always good to trust your gut.

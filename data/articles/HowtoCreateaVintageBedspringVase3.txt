 For this project, you’ll need a bedspring, an ear of corn, wire and a wire cutter. Cut a length of wire, long enough to hang your birdfeeder from the branch of a tree. Attach your wire to the widest part of your bed spring’s cone. Slide the corn inside the bedspring and hang your birdfeeder from a tree.Before hanging your feeder, enclose the corn in the feeder by attaching a few lengths of wire over the top of bedspring cone. This will keep squirrels from coming and stealing the whole piece of corn.
Make sure to cut off all loose wire pieces, so no animals can accidentally cut themselves.
 Take your bedspring and clean and degrease it. Paint it black and allow it to dry for a day. After your bedspring has dried completely, roll some wax paper into the shape of a cone and insert it into the cone of your bedspring. Fill the wax paper with fries and use it to make a statement at your next dinner party.Spray paint is not food safe, even when dry, so always make sure the wax paper is creating a barrier between the fries and the bedspring.
For a vintage diner feel, try spray painting your bedspring fire engine red.
 Place your bedspring on its side and slide your holiday cards between the coils. You can also use your bedspring to organize your mail or display family photos.When you get sick of using your bedspring as a display case, flip it upright and use it to hold your pencils and other office supplies.
If you have more than one bedspring, consider wrapping cutlery in napkins and inserting the rolled up silverware into the bedspring for a fun place setting at dinner parties.

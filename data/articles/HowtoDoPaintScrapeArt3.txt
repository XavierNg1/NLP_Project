 Sgraffito is when a painter scratches through a top layer of paint to expose the pigment beneath. It’s great for linear details, like hair. Next time you paint a portrait, try using a thin painting knife or utility blade to scratch thin lines for your figure’s hair.When scraping away a top layer of paint, make sure the undercoat is completely dry or you’ll end up muddying your colors.
 You can use a scraping technique to create details like individual tree trunks in a forest. Try cutting up an expired credit card or piece of foam board. Dip the pieces in paint and dab or scrape them to create details.You can use oil or acrylic paint if you're using a credit card. Pieces of foam board work best with acrylic.
Try scraping them across the surface to create bodies of water or windows in a building.
You can also lightly dab the paint-dipped pieces right onto your composition to create trees, blades of grass, and other lines.
 Like sgraffito, scumbling involves using a knife to scrape away small sections of a painting’s top coat. First, try painting a sky in your painting's first coats, then use the next layers of paint to suggest a tree-lined horizon. Use a knife to scumble, or remove, bits of the treeline to create small holes where the sky peeks through branches.Scumbling works for oil and acrylic paints. To avoid muddying colors, make sure the undercoat paint is dry before scumbling over it.
 In addition to portraits and landscapes, paint scraping techniques are useful when creating abstract works. Try spreading layers of paint with a palette knife, spatula, or squeegee. Use the tools to scrape the surface and remove patches of paint, blend pigments, or create expressive gestures.Many great contemporary abstract painters use scraping tools to create improvised marks.

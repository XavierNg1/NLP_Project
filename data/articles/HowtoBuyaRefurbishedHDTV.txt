 Since refurbished HDTVs are not in mint condition, their pricing should be significantly lower than brand new HDTVs in mint condition.


Perform an Internet search for the brand name and model of the refurbished HDTV you plan on buying, then take note of its pricing on various websites for both new and refurbished models.
Call retail stores that sell HDTVs in your local area to determine the pricing of brand new and refurbished HDTVs of the same model you are interested in buying.;
, If for some reason the HDTV stops working properly shortly after its purchase, a warranty will help cover the costs of any necessary repairs.


Look for warranties that last a minimum of 45 days, then inquire about your options for buying an extended warranty. Vendors who offer warranties that last at least 45 days are usually considered reputable and are confident in the reliability of their products.
If you are buying a refurbished HDTV from another country, verify that the warranty is also valid in your country. In most cases, warranties are limited to the country from which the HDTV was purchased.
 This may protect you from financial loss if the refurbished HDTV does not work properly or if you are unsatisfied with the product.


Verify the amount of time in which you can return the HDTV and whether a restocking fee is applicable. Some vendors may charge you a percentage of the sale amount or high-priced fees if you decide to return the HDTV.
 The reasons as to why an HDTV is refurbished may impact your buying decision. For example, a refurbished HDTV with torn packaging may be in near-mint condition; whereas an HDTV that has undergone numerous repairs may stop functioning properly after a short amount of time.


Ask the store manager why the HDTV is refurbished, or look for an explanation on the website if you are purchasing the HDTV online.

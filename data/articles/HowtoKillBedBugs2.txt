 Many commercial pesticides can be used against bed bugs, but you must make sure that the pesticide you choose is specifically labeled for bed bug use. Many general pesticides or those used for other insects, like ants or wasps, are not effective against bed bugs.


Choose a pesticide geared toward use in a specific location for the strongest results. In general, there are pesticides used to treat the outdoors, mattresses, the whole home, a whole room, and cracks or surfaces.
There are also certain active ingredients that are commonly found in pesticides used against bed bugs. These include bifenthrin, boric acid, cold pressed neem oil, deltamethrin, tetramethrin, and propoxur, among others.
When possible, purchase a product that has been registered with the EPA. These products have been officially tested for effectiveness., There are not general instructions that apply to all pesticides; you must follow the instructions provided on the label of the specific pesticide you choose.


Never use an outdoor pesticide indoors.
Using a pesticide incorrectly could be dangerous for your health. It may also prove ineffective against the bed bugs.
Only throw the instructions away once the pesticide has been completely used up. Save the instructions as long as some of the chemical remains inside the container.
 If commercial, home-use pesticides fail, call a professional. The chemicals used by professional exterminators are often more powerful, and the techniques used to apply those chemicals are also more thorough and expertly performed.


Find out from the exterminator if he or she wants you to prepare your home in any particular way before fumigation occurs. The exterminator may have you discard bedding or fabrics that are damaged beyond repair or remove anything that can be harmed by the chemicals being used.

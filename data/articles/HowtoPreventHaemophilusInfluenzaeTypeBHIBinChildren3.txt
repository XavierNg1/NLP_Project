 Meningitis (infection of the fluid and lining around the brain and spinal cord), pneumonia (infection in the lung), and epiglottitis (infection in the throat that makes it hard to breathe) are the most important diseases caused by Hib bacteria. In developing countries pneumonia is more common than meningitis in children with Hib disease, but Hib disease should be suspected in the case of any child with signs and symptoms of meningitis or pneumonia.Symptoms of Hib meningitis include fever, decreased mental status (confusion, lethargy, behavioral changes), and stiff neck.The diagnosis of Hib disease is usually made based on one or more laboratory tests using a sample of infected body fluid, such as blood or spinal fluid., Hib disease is treated with antibiotics. Most people with Hib disease require hospitalization. Even with antibiotic treatment, 3% to 6% of all children with Hib meningitis die from the disease.Immediate treatment can improve chances of survival.


An additional 15% to 30% of survivors suffer some permanent neurologic damage, including blindness, deafness, and intellectual disability.
 Children younger than 2 years old don't develop very good immune responses to either the vaccine or the infection, and may not develop protective levels of antibodies. This means that a child could get Hib disease more than once.Children younger than 2 years old who have recovered from invasive Hib disease are not protected and should receive the Hib vaccine as soon as possible.

 Checking a pig from behind can help you to determine if it has good strong legs. The legs should be straight and sturdy looking. You should also look for a 45 degree angle or V-shape between the pig’s legs. If the pig's legs are wider or narrower than this, then the pig may not make a good project.Avoid pigs that have wide set legs or that have a square appearance from behind. This indicates that the pig may have too much fat on its body and will not produce lean meat, which is what most pork consumers prefer.
 If you are competing with your pig, then it is important to make sure that your pig does not have any obvious defects. If the pig has any obvious defects, then do not purchase it. Common structural defects may include:a hernia on the pig’s scrotum or stomach, which will look like a small or large lump. If you notice anything protruding from the pig's belly or scrotum, then do not purchase this pig.
kyphosis, which will look like a hump on the pig's back. If a pig looks like it has a curved back or a hump on its back, then do not purchase it.
 By looking at a pig from the side, you can get an idea of what its body structure is like and how quickly it is growing. Look for a pig whose legs all seem to be positioned at the same angle and that walks with its head held up. This indicates that the pig has a good body structure and that it will make a good project.Avoid pigs that walk with their heads bent low or that have legs bending at different angles. All of the pig's legs should bend at the same angle and should be about the same length.
As you check the pig from the side, pay attention to the distance between the pig's body and the ground. The pig's legs should all be the same length and its weight should look like it is evenly distributed. If the pig's front legs are obviously shorter than the back legs, then avoid purchasing this pig.

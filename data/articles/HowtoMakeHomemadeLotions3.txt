 Add ¼ cup (52 g) of coconut oil, ⅛ cup (71 g) of shea butter, and ⅛ cup (72 g) of cocoa butter to a small saucepan. Place it on the stove, and heat the ingredients on low until they melt completely, which should take 10 to 15 minutes.To keep the lotion from solidifying after you mix it, it’s best to use raw shea butter.
Stir the mixture as it’s melting to ensure that it’s heating evenly.
 When the coconut oil mixture has melted, remove the pan from the heat. Add in 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of aloe vera juice, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of sweet almond oil, and 5 to 10 drops of your favorite essential oils. Stir until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.You can substitute jojoba oil for the almond oil if you prefer.
You can use any combination of essential oils that you prefer, but it’s a good idea to include oils that target the skin issues that you wish to treat.
If you have dry or aging skin, geranium and rose essential oils are good options.
For skin issues such as eczema or psoriasis, jasmine, rose, chamomile, lavender, and sandalwood essential oils work well.
If you want to create an energizing lotion,use grapefruit or lemon essential oil.
If you want to prevent stretch marks, mix in lavender, neroli, patchouli, rose, and/or geranium essential oils.
 Once all of the ingredients are fully mixed, use a spoon to carefully transfer the lotion to a jar or other storage container. The lotion should stay fresh for 1 to 2 months.Small canning jars make excellent containers for the lotion.
While the lotion will keep for up to 2 months at room temperature, refrigerating it can prolong its life for an additional couple of months.

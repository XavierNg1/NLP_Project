 Use a circular, massaging motion. Use your fingers to spread the cleanser all over your face, including your hairline. This should take about 45 seconds.Make sure your hair is pulled back away from your face with a ponytail, headband, or bobby pins.
Long-lasting or liquid foundation should be removed before you wash your face.Choose a mild cleansing oil or water designed to remove makeup, or go natural with coconut oil. Look for water-soluble formulas that will rinse away with no residue.If your skin is oily or prone to breakouts and not too sensitive to friction, try a makeup removing wipe. This will gently exfoliate your skin while removing makeup.Do not use baby wipes, which are designed to clean a baby's skin, not interact with and lift off makeup., Most of your foundation and blush should come off--you should be able to see it on the washcloth.Make sure you get your hairline, under your chin, and around your ears., If you find that you are breaking out along your hairline or you go super heavy on makeup (if you are a cheerleader or actor, you probably have to wear a ton of makeup while performing), try applying a thick layer of cold cream to your face and let it sit for a few minutes.









Wipe the cold cream off your face with a warm washcloth and the stubborn makeup should come right off with it.

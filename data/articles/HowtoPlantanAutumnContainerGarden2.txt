 In the spring and summer months you typically space plants further apart in container gardens because the plants will grow into each other as they mature. In the fall, however, place plants closer together in order to fill the container. These plants will likely stagnate and not grow much bigger. As a result, you should select plants that are already mature and place them close to each other to create a full and beautiful container garden., In order to design an appealing autumn container garden, you should take into consideration the colour and size of the plants. Choose colours that complement each other. You should also select plants that are a variety of heights. For instance, you do not want to plant all low bedding with no taller plants to add variety. Instead, you should look to include ground cover, taller plants, and maybe even a few plants that will hang over the edges of the container.For example, you could plant red chrysanthemums with some yellow ornamental grasses and green and purple heuchera.
This will cover different height levels and will give an excellent pop of colour to your home in the autumn months.
 It is also important to consider the type of container to use in the fall and winter months. Clay pots may crack and break in the colder weather. Instead, you should use fiberglass, iron, stone, or thick plaster containers that can stand up to the changing weather conditions. Many of these options are extremely heavy and may be difficult to move around.Try planting in a lightweight plastic container and then placing that inside your larger stone or iron containers.This will also make it easier for you to take out and switch plants between seasons.

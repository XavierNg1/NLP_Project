 Make your way to the Dive Spot.;
, Travel south underwater until you reach a small area where you can go back to the surface. Once there, go back to the surface.
 The Braille tells you to Dig. Use Dig in that exact spot to enter the next room.
 It translates to "First comes Relicanth, then comes Wailord". Now, put Relicanth in the first slot in your party, and Wailord in the last. This will trigger an earthquake, and doors will appear to open far away.
 Surf north on Rt 105 to reach the Island Cave. Make sure to save your game. Once inside, go up to the braille and read it. It says to not move for two whole minutes. Go do something else, turn your volume on your game up, and after two minutes are up, the screen will flash, you will hear a noise and a door will appear. This door goes to Regice's room where you can battle him.
 Go to the very middle of the Braille wall and move twice right, then twice down. It is important that you follow those instructions carefully, or the process won't work. You will then be able to use Strength on thin air, revealing another door. Go inside and you will battle Regirock.
 This cave is called the Ancient Tomb. The riddle requires you to go to the direct center of the room, which is six steps backwards from the inscription with the riddle, and use Fly, which opens Registeel's tomb. Save your game, because you are about to battle the final Regi!

 Grab a bag or bin and toss in any wrappers, tissues, scraps of paper, and so on.


If trash routinely accumulates on your nightstand, put a bag or bin within arm's reach.;
, In the photo, there's an umbrella, but it's unlikely to rain inside a bedroom, so put the umbrella in the car or the coat rack, where it will be handy the next time you go out.
 If your nightstand is where coins, keys, wallet, and other pocket stuff lands every night, don't worry too much about changing your (or your spouse's) habits. Instead, make it official by giving them a basket or tray. Whether you put that basket on top or in a drawer is up to you.
 Try to use your nightstand drawers to store items you will use in or near the bed. Find other homes for things you don't use in bed. Unless you sleep with it, your bottle cap collection can live in other, more appropriate quarters.



Put things on the top that need to be accessible. Things like lamps, clocks, phones, and tissues should generally go on top.
If you like to read in bed, do you have space for books? The right place depends on where there is space. If you have a shelf on the nightstand, you can put some books there. If not, place bookshelves nearby and use the nightstand for only the current read.
 As you do, think about why the things ended up there. Are things landing here because of lack of space on the nightstand? Are they there because the laundry hamper should be closer to where you undress?

 Even if you can’t afford to give money, you can sign up to receive updates from the Center. These updates will usually include a call to action to contact your elected representatives. You can sign up on the Center’s home page., The NILC posts job openings on their website. However, they also need interns at both their Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. offices. The D.C. office also has fellowships available. These jobs are intended for law students, though graduate students may also apply for the internships in D.C.


The internships are unpaid but academic credit may be available. The fellowship pays a $1,500 stipend.You can apply by sending a resume, cover letter, writing sample, transcript, and three professional references to jobs@nilc.org. In the subject line, you should type “L.A. Internship” or “DC Internship.”

 Immigration is a hot-button issue, and the laws are subject to change. You can influence public policy by speaking out or attending rallies. For example, you could write a letter to your newspaper or share links from the NILC website with friends on social media

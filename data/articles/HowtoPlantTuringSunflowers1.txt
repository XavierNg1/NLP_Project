 Tall varieties of sunflowers require lots of sun and a sheltered position. Tall flower heads can bend over in moderate winds, which can cause their stems to break.;
, You can also use fairly deep, large containers and planters but they might need weighing down to prevent the tall plant from tipping them over. Heavy-based pots are better, such as ones made of stone or terracotta.
 Birds love sunflower seeds. You may find birds will peck and scatter the seed heads, which can make a big mess underneath the sunflowers.


The scattering of seeds also means that some of your sunflowers may self-sow, which means sunflowers might start growing in the general vicinity of the original sunflower.
 It’s best to wait until the frosts are over if you want to plant your sunflowers outdoors.


Alternately, you can start your sunflowers off in a pot indoors in the early spring and then move them outdoors in late spring once all risk of frost is over.
 Weed the area where you plan to plant your sunflower. You can help improve soil fertility by mixing some compost into the soil.
 To plant this tall variety of sunflowers, start planting in the spring. You can easily buy packets of seeds in gardening stores or online and they are some of the cheapest flower seeds to buy.


You may have less luck using seeds you have gathered yourself from previous year’s sunflower harvest as these aren’t always fertile.
 Plant the seeds about one inch deep into the compost you have mixed into your soil. Leave about 20 inches (50.8 cm) of space between seeds, then water the area well. Keep the soil moist until the sunflowers have sprouted.


Sprouting can take two to three weeks.
 Some gardeners like to plant two seeds together as not all of them will sprout. If both seedlings emerge, you can remove and discard the one that looks less strong, or transplant the seedling to another position at least 20 inches (50.8 cm) away.

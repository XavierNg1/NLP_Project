 You should always see a veterinarian to verify the injury, but in the meantime, check the area of the shoulder. In the case of a fracture, it will be swollen and painful to the touch. Swelling and pain in another part of the leg may indicate that a fracture is located elsewhere. In addition, your dog will not use that leg for walking because it moves the shoulder, causing the fracture or dislocation to move.
 If your dog has a fracture or dislocation in the shoulder, you’ll need some basic supplies to wrap it properly. Ideally, you should keep these items on hand in a first aid kit:


large roll of cotton
adhesive bandage

, Try to calm your dog and get it into a standing position. If possible, have someone else hold and support the dog while you wrap the shoulder; this will decrease the weight on the other legs.
 Take your roll of cotton and use it to wrap the shoulder area and the foreleg. Then place a roll of cotton between the injured shoulder and the chest.


The amount of cotton padding necessary depends on the size of the dog. Your main objectives should be providing stability and ensuring that there is no contact between the shoulder and the chest.
 Flex the elbow and foreleg of the dog, so it is bent. It will make the shape of a “Z.”

, Wrap an adhesive bandage around the foreleg and up the side of the chest, then over the shoulder. Then bring the bandage down the side of the other shoulder, across the chest, and back to the original foreleg.
 Repeat these motions, keeping the elbow below the level of the paws.
 These instructions are only meant to help you provide immediate first aid when necessary. If your dog has a fracture or dislocation, you need to see a veterinarian.

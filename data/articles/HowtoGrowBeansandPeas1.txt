 Beans typically want (unfiltered) full sun, which is defined as at least 6 hours of sunlight per day.They do very well in warmer climates such as that of the American South. Some bean varieties, such as those that were traditionally grown using in cornfields using the three-sisters method (i.e. beanstalks twining around cornstalks with squash at the base), are more tolerant of shade and will still produce in dappled sunlight or with under 6 hours a day.



Make a sun chart to determine which parts of your yard or patio will be best for beans.;
, Each will have different light, space, planting, and harvesting requirements, not to mention a different flavor. Some beans (like snap beans) are grown to be eaten raw – pod and all – while others are meant to be shelled and dried for later use in cooking. There are two general categories of bean:


Pole beans grow tall and must be trellised.Not only are they beautiful to look at, but they also make the most of vertical space.
Bush beans are compact and don’t need supports.Since they don’t cast long shadows, they can more easily be planted in and around other plants.

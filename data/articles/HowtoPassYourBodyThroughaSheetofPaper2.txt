 For the index card, you'll need to fold it hotdog style, or longways., From the folded edge, make two initial incisions on the left and right sides. Leave a little bit less than an inch for the index card's strips.
 Starting from one of the slits, cut parallel to the folded edge. You'll want to make the cut a little less than an inch down from the folded edge.
 Starting from the unfolded edge, cut upwards towards the rectangle you just removed. Again, you'll want to space these slits a little under an inch.
 Now continue your cuts, alternating sides, until you reach the other end of the index card.
 Carefully unfold the paper. This will feel like you're opening up an accordion.You should be able to fit through the index card.

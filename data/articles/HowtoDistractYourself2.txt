 When you focus on breathing deeply, you can help your body release stress and anxiety. Your mind will start to clear as you think only about breathing. Breathe in for a count of four. Hold for a count of four. Exhale for a count of four. Place your hand on your stomach to feel it moving in and out with the breath.
 A mantra is a simple phrase or word that you repeat to yourself. When you find yourself in a situation when you want to distract yourself from thinking certain thoughts or doing certain activities, use a positive mantra. For example, if you want to distract yourself from anxious feelings, you might say, “I am strong,” or “I can cope.” This will turn your mental energy away from the negative feelings as you focus on yourself repeating these words., If you are feeling negative emotions, you might find it useful to get some exercise. Going for a walk or bike ride will allow you to focus on one activity.
 When you sleep, your mind will quiet down and you will stop thinking so actively. Curl up in bed for a nap.

 A good general rule for pruning perennial sunflowers is to cut them down to half their size in the late spring or early summer. Then, reduce their size again by a third in June or July.;
, Gardeners from warmer climates should prune Maximillian, swamp (Helianthus angustifolius), and willow leafed (Helianthus salicifolius) sunflowers to two-thirds of their original height in June.


This procedure will keep these potential giants at a more manageable size and eliminate the need to stake them.
 Most perennial sunflower species bloom between mid and late summer. Gardeners should keep an eye on their plants at such times and refrain from pruning them after their buds start forming.However, the rules are slightly different for late summer blooming varieties. Late summer blooming types should be pruned back when they reach between 1.5 to 2 feet (0.5 to 0.6 m) in height, because they will recover in a few weeks and bloom regardless of the cuts.
 Maximilian sunflowers (Helianthus maximiliani) and Mexican sunflowers (Tithonia diversifolia) should be trimmed in June or July. This will reduce the sunflowers’ size from their typical height of 9 feet (2.7 m) or greater to a much more manageable 4 feet (1.2 m).Maximilian sunflowers can also be left standing through the winter months as food for the birds. If you choose to leave your tall sunflowers for the birds, they can be cut to the ground in the early spring to prepare the plant for new growth.
 Annual sunflowers can be trimmed back to the ground when they start to dry out and turn brown. They will not bloom again so many gardeners choose to remove them from their gardens entirely.

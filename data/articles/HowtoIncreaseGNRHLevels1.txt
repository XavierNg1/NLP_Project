 Testosterone supplements are the primary way of treating GnRH deficiency for men. Testosterone is given either as a patch, a shot, or as a pill. You can start this therapy as early as twelve years of age.Shots of testosterone are given once a month. In comparison, you will use the patch every other day or take the pill daily.;
, Women will be prescribed either a patch, gel, or a pill that contains estradiol. This is a form of estrogen. At first, you will be given a small dose, which will be increased slowly over a period of one to two years.After several months of estradiol therapy, your doctor may add progesterone or progestin to your treatment. You must be on estradiol first before you can add these to your treatment plan.
 Low GnRH levels cause a lack of two hormones called gonadotropins. There are two types of gonadotropin: Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH). You can get injections of these to help start puberty or to make you fertile.Both men and women can undergo this therapy. Your doctor will decide if you need FSH, LH, or both.
You may need to go to the doctor or hospital for these injections, but in some cases, you may be prescribed injections to give yourself at home.
 In both sexes, GnRH deficiency can cause infertility, but pustuleÂ  GnRH therapy can help. Instead of injections, this hormone therapy gives you the missing gonadotropin hormones through an IV pump. Each treatment session can last between one and two hours.

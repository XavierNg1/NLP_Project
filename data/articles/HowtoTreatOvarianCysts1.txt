 Treatment depends on the type of ovarian cyst. Most often, the first course of action is to wait. Functional cysts often disappear on their own within a few cycles. The cysts may be monitored by ultrasounds every one to three cycles to determine if the cysts are getting smaller or not., Pain relievers can help alleviate the pain connected to ovarian cysts. Acetaminophen, like Tylenol, NSAIDs, like Aleve or Advil, and aspirin, like Bayer, can help., Your physician may prescribe oral contraceptives to control and prevent some forms of ovarian cysts. Oral contraceptives are useful in both preventing and sometimes treating ovarian cysts. If you are using the oral contraceptives for birth control, you will probably be put on a regular dose. If the oral contraceptives are being used only to treat the cysts, the dose will be the lowest possible for the shortest period of time.Taking birth control pills decreases the risk of some types of ovarian cysts, but carry their own risks. These include an increased risk of cancer of the breast, cervix, and liver, heart disease, and stroke., Surgery to treat ovarian cysts is very rare. However, if your cyst looks large, is recurrent, or there are multiple cysts, your doctor may suggest that they be surgically removed. Your doctor may also consider removing the cyst if it causes a lot of pain or other problems. This treatment option needs to be discussed with your doctor.

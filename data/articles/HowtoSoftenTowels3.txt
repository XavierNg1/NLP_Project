 Laundry soap is highly concentrated, and a little bit goes a long way. If you use too much, the residue can congeal on the fabric, making the fibers stiff and scratchy. Try using less detergent than you normally would.


Too much detergent residue can also foster mold and bacterial growth â€“ especially if a towel stays damp for a while.
 If the chamber is too full, it might be keeping your towels from getting a full rinse. This can leave the fabric stiff with residue from minerals, dirt, and detergent.


The same goes for drying! Be patient and run multiple loads to avoid overcrowding.
 If your home's water supply is "hard" and full of minerals, then the faucet or washing machine might be leaving chalky deposits in your towels. Consider buying a mineral filter to soften up your water supply, or washing your towels only with off-grid water.

 You should ask yourself the following questions:Did the driver arrive on time?
Was the ride smooth?
Was the car clean?
Did the driver have a good attitude?
Was a reasonable route used?;
, If your driver has been receptive to unusual or difficult requests during your ride, their patience might warrant a tip.

This especially applies if you were sick--or otherwise afflicted--during your ride.
 Generally speaking, you'll want to tip between fifteen and twenty percent of your total fare for an average tip. If your driver was truly exceptional, you might want to tip higher.

If you don't have access to a calculator (e.g., your smartphone), take a tenth of your fare (for example, a tenth of twenty would be two) and double it to make a twenty percent tip.
 Since Uber doesn't allow for tipping from within the app, you'll need to give your driver their tip in cash. Based on your consideration of the ride and both your driver's behavior and your own, put together your tip before arriving at your destination., Do this once you arrive at your location.

Some drivers won't take a tip outright. You can choose to leave the tip anyway at your discretion.

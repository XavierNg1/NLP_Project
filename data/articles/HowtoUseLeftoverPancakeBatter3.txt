 Cover your bowl of extra batter with plastic wrap and keep it in the fridge for a day or two. Alternatively, consider storing your extra pancake batter in a plastic container with a resealable lid. An empty milk carton is perfect, as your can dispense the batter directly from the container., Use an airtight freezer bag to store any extra pancake batter you want to keep for more than one or two days. Make sure zip-top bags are designed for freezer storage, or double bag them. Squeeze the air out of the bags before sealing them., Freeze just enough batter to be used the next time you want to make pancakes in its own bag. Once the batter starts to freeze, take it out of the freezer and roll it into a cone, with one end at one of the bagâ€™s bottom corners. The next time you want to make pancakes, thaw the cone and snip off the corner at the pointy end. You can then squeeze batter out of the bag and directly onto your pan.

 Chivalry might be slowly becoming outdated, but as it stands today, plenty of girls still find acts of chivalry impressive. There are plenty of ways to do small chivalrous things that make your girl feel special, for example:Pull her chair out for her when sitting down at a restaurant.
Open doors for her.
Help her take off her coat.
 Don't give all of your attention to your girlfriend when you're hanging out with her friends or at her house when her family is around. Socialize with her friends. Try to establish a friendly rapport with them. If you're at her place for dinner with her folks, offer to help clean up, or set up the table. Impress her friends and family, and you'll impress her., It may be a stereotype that girls want guys who take most of the initiative, but it's a stereotype for a reason. While the last thing you should do is try to control her life, most girls appreciate it when their boyfriend puts effort into things like planning dates, finding things to do on the weekend, and just generally being decisive.Sometimes this can be as simple as deciding quickly where the two of you should sit at lunch, or where you should go to eat.
 Celebrate moments of joy, achievements and birthdays with her. Look for ways to go out of your way to show that you care. This can be as simple as surprising her with flowers, or as grand as planning a romantic home-cooked dinner.Don't forget to celebrate your anniversaries together. It never hurts to surprise your girl with a small present for your one month or six month anniversary.

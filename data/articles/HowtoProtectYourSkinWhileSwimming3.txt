 Outdoor pools allow for the chemicals in the water to escape into the air, leaving less of them that can damage your skin. Freshwater pools are also a good option as they do not contain salt or other substances that can damage your skin.If you are going to swim indoors, go for a pool that has good ventilation and low chlorine content.
 The longer you spend in the water, the more damage you are doing to your skin. Over time, your skin will start to prune and feel dry due to the chemicals in the pool. Take breaks out of the water and try not to stay in the water for longer than two to three hours at a time., Make sure you shower, moisturize, and put on sunscreen before you hop into the pool or the ocean. Then, always shower right away and moisturize again when you get out of the water. Having a regular pre and post swim routine will ensure your skin stays protected while you swim.

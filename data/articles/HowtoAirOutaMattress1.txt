 Remove all clothing, sheets and even pillows from the mattress so that it is completely open to the air. If possible, open all windows and allow the sun to shine on the mattress through the window.


When the sun shines on the mattress, it will naturally purge it of many germs and bacteria.
This is the ideal time to wash your sheets and other bedding as necessary. A recommended washing time is weekly for sheets and pillowcases and quarterly for blankets and heavier bedding items.
Wash the mattress cover monthly to quarterly, depending on how dirty it appears.;
, With the mattress exposed to the fresh air, run your vacuum over the mattress to gather any dust which may have accumulated on it. You need not vacuum every time you air the mattress, but a weekly or monthly vacuuming will help to remove dust and dust mites. With the mattress vacuumed, air will more easily flow over and through the mattress, and you will reduce the amount of time needed to air it.
 You will be unable to easily maneuver your mattress outside yourself. In order to get it through your house and outside, enlist the aid of an able-bodied friend. Air the mattress outdoors as often as you have time for, but aim for once or twice a year. Get help moving it to a dry, clean spot outdoors. Make sure it is a sunny out, whether it's winter or summer.
 Don't leave the mattress out in the evening air or it will become damp. Return it to the bedroom before the sun disappears.

 Make sure you rinse your hair well and wash it with an acid-balanced shampoo as soon as you are done working out. You do not want your hair to sit with sweat and dirt in it once you have finished exercising, as this can lead to frizz. You should also apply conditioner to your hair when you wash it so it is thoroughly clean.To avoid over washing your hair, you may plan your hair appointments and washings around your workout. For example, if you know you are going to workout on Friday morning, you may wash your hair less frequently during the week and then do a major wash of your hair after your workout on Friday.
 Always let your hair dry completely before you style it. Let your hair air dry or dry it with a towel. You may also apply leave-in conditioner in your hair to keep the frizz under control.Try to avoid using a blow dryer to dry your hair, as the heat can damage it. If you do use a blow dryer, make sure you use heat protectant spray or gel on your hair before you dry it.
 After a workout, you may not have the energy to style your hair in an elaborate way. For a simple solution, embrace your natural curls and let your hair dry to its natural shape. Or put your hair up in a simple pony tail or bun for a sleek but stylish look.You can also apply a hair attachment to your hair once it is dry for a quick style that will not appear frizzy. Spray sculpting mist on your hair and hairline, and then tie a satin scarf around your head. Apply the hair attachment, such as a bun, and secure it with pins. Then, remove the scarf and enjoy your quick but sleek post gym hair look.

 811 was created to help protect people from unintentionally hitting underground utility lines while working on digging projects.;
, Specification for distance between piers can be found in most books about deck construction. These holes are one foot square and one foot deep. The existing ground around the hole should be undisturbed as it provides the lateral support for the post. Poor positioning of the hole will result in a larger hole and less support.

, Note the sides are vertical and the bottom is flat.
 This will allow you to create a flat level surface to place the paver on. It also absorbs some of the expansion and contraction that characterizes some soils.
 This is important to prevent the weight of the deck from pushing the piers down and creating sags in the deck.
 Then check the level in both directions on the posts top. You may also use a small 12" level on the paver. If it is not level, add more gravel or sand and recompact.
 This deck is attached to a retaining wall and a ledger board is the basis for the level. Position the pier and strike a line on the pier level with the top of the ledger.
 This assures a square cut that allows the beam to rest more completely on the end of the pier. These piers are 4" pressure treated peeler cores. You could also use pressure treated 4"x 4" posts.
, Use the same points for every pier. Don't measure from pier to pier. If one pier is off, you will multiply the error.
 This will allow you to relocate the pier if it is bumped or move accidentally.
 Hold the pier to prevent the dirt from moving it off it proper location.
 The dirt should compact to at least 3 inches (7.6Â cm), and the pier should be stable enough to stand on its own.
 You should have more dirt that the remaining space in the hole because of pier, paver, and gravel.

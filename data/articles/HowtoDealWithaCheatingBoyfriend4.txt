 Don't smother him. If you're clingy or possessive over him, he may push you away. If he feels trapped with you, he may resort to cheating as a means of freeing himself.
 If he doesn't feel his needs are being met, he will find a way to meet them, and if you can't satisfy those needs, he'll find someone else who will.


Be adventurous in bed and open to do the things he wants to do, as long as his demands are reasonable.
Boring or repetitive sex can drive him to find somebody else to satisfy his urges.
Genuinely enjoying sex makes all the difference. If he thinks he isn't satisfying you, this may cause him to reassure his ego that he is good in bed by satisfying someone else.
 Blaming and accusing him for every little thing will push him to seek acceptance elsewhere, not just sexual acceptance, but emotional as well.
 Love is not a competition, so don't try to win. Dismissing everything he says or being condescending with him will cause him to retaliate.

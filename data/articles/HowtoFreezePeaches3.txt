 Depending on how many peaches you have, you may need to use multiple containers. You can use either tubs or freezer bags. Make sure to leave a few inches of free space between the peaches and the rim of the container.
 Freezing peaches in a packing solution prevents them from sticking together and helps to preserve their sweet flavor. Choose from among the following solutions to pour over the peaches, leaving half an inch or so of headspace between the top of the peaches and the rim of the container.









Water. If you prefer not to use any added sugar, you can add plain water to the container to help preserve the peaches.
Sugar. Line the bottom of the container with peach wedges, then sprinkle sugar over the layer. Add another layer and sprinkle it with more sugar. Continue doing this until you've filled the container to within 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of the rim.
Syrup. Make a syrup solution by 4 cups of water and 1 1/2 - 2 cups of sugar in a saucepan until the sugar dissolves. Let the syrup cool, then pour it over the peaches., Make sure you include the date they were processed and packed.
 They should keep for 8 to 10 months.

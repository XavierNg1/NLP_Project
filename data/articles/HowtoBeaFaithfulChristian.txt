 You should read your Bible twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. If you focus just on God for 5-10 minutes, it really helps. Try to find time to read a verse or two from the Bible, and concentrate on what God is saying in the those verses.;
, Pray to him when you feel happy, sad, angry, scared, or just bored. Tell him your feelings and don't hold back on it. Not only are you strengthening your relationship with God, but it also really makes you feel better when you have someone to talk to.
 If you have a conflict, even if it is something as simple as, "I wonder if I should eat this last slice of cake?" You should ask yourself if what Jesus would do in this conflict. So, Jesus would probably not take that last slice of cake, but let someone else have it.
 A lot of times in our lives, we are tempted to do things we know we shouldn't do. Even though it's hard, the best thing to do is avoid it. Just walk away if the temptation is hard, and if it just keeps coming, pray to God to help lift your temptation, and find something to distract yourself. If someone is peer pressuring you to do something that isn't right, you should just tell them to stop, and walk away from it.
 It doesn't matter what type of Christian you are. There is a church out there for you. Attend any services you can, and make sure you take notes on the sermon. Also, attending a Sunday School helps, too. Most churches have Sunday Schools for adults and kids.

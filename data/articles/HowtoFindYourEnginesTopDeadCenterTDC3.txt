 Instead of removing the spark plug to replace it with a stopper tool, you can use your thumb to get a good approximation of top dead center that will be accurate enough for you to install your distributor or spark plug wires, but will not be specific enough to align your camshafts.Make sure to remove the spark plug using a spark plug socket, otherwise it will simply unthread and remain in the hole.
Be extremely careful not to allow anything to fall in the hole while the spark plug is removed.
 As the engine rotates, the piston will rise inside cylinder one and you’ll be able to feel the increase in pressure. Take your thumb and insert it into the hole the spark plug came out of so you’ll be able to feel the change in pressure within the cylinder.Make sure your thumb is positioned to it creates a seal over the hole.
 As you keep your thumb over the spark plug hole, have a friend rotate the engine counter clockwise using a wrench of the appropriate size. Have them continue to rotate the engine until the increase in pressure pushes your thumb off the spark plug hole as it nears top dead center. Pay attention as your friend rotates the motor so you’ll notice when your thumb is pushed off the hole.
As soon as your thumb moves it will relieve the pressure, allowing you to place it over the hole again.
 Once your thumb has been pushed off the spark plug hole, use a flashlight to peer down into the hole at how close the cylinder is to the hole itself. Have your friend rotate the motor very slowly as you watch to get it as close as possible to top dead center.This process is accurate to within 15 degrees, so it should not be used to install new camshafts.
Make sure to reconnect the battery after reinstalling the spark plug.

 Use inverse operations to move any part of the equation that is not part of the logarithm to the opposite side of the equation.



Example: log3(x + 5) + 6 = 10

log3(x + 5) + 6 - 6 = 10 - 6
log3(x + 5) = 4

;
, Using what you now know about the relationship between logarithms and exponential equations, break the logarithm apart and rewrite the equation in a simpler, solvable exponential form.



Example:log3(x + 5) = 4

Comparing this equation to the definition , you can conclude that: y = 4; b = 3; x = x + 5
Rewrite the equation so that: by = x
34 = x + 5



, With the problem simplified into a basic exponential equation, you should be able to solve it as you would solve any exponential equation.



Example: 34 = x + 5

3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = x + 5
81 = x + 5
81 - 5 = x + 5 - 5
76 = x



, The answer you got when solving for x is the solution to your original logarithm.



Example: x = 76

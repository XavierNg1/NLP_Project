 Begin making paleo hot chocolate by pouring 2 cups (473.18 ml) of almond or coconut milk into a small pot or saucepan, then placing the saucepan over medium-high heat., Heat the milk on the stove until it reaches a boil, then remove the milk from the heat. Make sure to remove the milk as soon as it starts boiling, as over-heating milk can cause it to scald., After you remove the milk from the stove, pour in 2 tablespoons (29.57 ml) unsweetened cocoa powder. You can also add ¼ teaspoon (1.23 ml) vanilla extract if you want to give the cocoa a slightly sweeter flavor.You can also use about 1.5-2 ounces (44.3 ml- 59.1 ml) of good quality dark chocolate in the place of unsweetened cocoa powder. Just make sure that the dark chocolate you select does not contain milk.
If you use a bar of dark chocolate instead of cocoa powder, chop the chocolate into small chunks so that it dissolves more easily.
 Stir the mixture of milk and cocoa powder until the powder is completely dissolved in the milk. If you are using dark chocolate chunks, stir until the chunks have completely melted into the milk.Add more cocoa powder if you want a more chocolate-y taste.
 You can also add coconut sugar to make the hot chocolate sweeter. Taste the hot chocolate and decide whether you want a sweeter taste. Add coconut sugar in by the teaspoon until you are happy with the taste.Coconut sugar is a natural, paleo-friendy sweetener that is made from the sap of the coconut palm tree. It is healthier than sugar and has a much lesser effect on blood sugar than does regular cane sugar., Once you are satisfied with the flavor of your hot chocolate, serve it while it’s hot! You can drink it with paleo-friendly toppings or alongside paleo treats like flourless brownies or cake.

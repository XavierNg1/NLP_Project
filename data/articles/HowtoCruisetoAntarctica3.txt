 Remember that you’re going to be stuck onboard for a number of days with nowhere else to get food. Contact each cruise operator that you’re interested in to find out if they can provide for your dietary needs if you have any specific restrictions or concerns. Although most if not all include meals in their ticket prices, double-check what this covers exactly. Expect the amount of courses offered per meal to vary, as well as the availability of snacks and certain beverages (like alcohol), which may only be offered at additional cost., Expect most cruises to offer a wide variety of onboard and onshore activities. However, anticipate that not all of these may be included in the ticket price. For instance, being transported from ship to shore may be part of the ticket price, but additional activities once you reach shore may involve rental fees for equipment on top of the initial ticket price., Keep in mind that the weather in Antarctica can be severe, even in the summer months. Prepare to dress accordingly. However, if budget is a concern, contact the operator before you go clothes-shopping. Although you will undoubtedly be responsible for items like thermal underwear and socks, find out if outer gear like parkas and rubber boots are covered by the ticket price or available to rent., Expect cabins onboard one ship to vary in price depending on their location, with cabins on lower decks usually being lower in price. Additionally, be aware that some companies offer the same itinerary on different ships with different prices. If one ship seems out of reach, find out if another ship with fewer amenities follows the same itinerary.

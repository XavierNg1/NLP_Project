 Say creative compliments. If they are a Starblogger, say, "Hey, I really liked your post on (subject of post). It was really (a nice word that describes the post). If they are a famous club owner, say, "I love your club! It's so (words like fun, interesting, etc.);
, It could be one of their friends you're being mean to, or worse, a best friend. If someone is insulting another person on the Stardoll queen's guestbook, say, "Hey, (username of insulter), stop bullying (username of person being insulted)! We're all friends here." The SQ will see that you are a nice person and you want to give peace. This is what a SQ would look for (if they are not snobby.)

, A SQ would not want a BFF who goes on Stardoll once a month. Always have friendly chat with the SQ like "Hey, I really like your outfit. Where did you get it?" or "Hey, do you know a good bazaar to get hot buys?" or if you want to be nice, "I saw that you're running for Covergirl. I'd love to help!"

, Personally, my favorite things to do are suite chat fashion shows, enrolling at modeling agencies, chit chatting at a club, or just hanging out at a party. No one wants a friend who just likes to say, "Hey. I think you're cool." or "Your outfit's pretty."

, If you're a girly and friendly girl, and there's a goth, snobby, but popular girl, you shouldn't be friends. Snobs and friendly girls don't work. Don't be that girl who only has friends because of their popularity.

 Maybe it's a holiday with your family where you had a laugh, or your first kiss... whatever it is, think back to it and just wait for the smile to creep onto your face.;
, Read a joke book or funny story, watch a comedy, or hang out with some naturally funny people.
 Do something that you used to do when you were little, like dancing in the rain, or making sandcastles. Just acting like a little kid again will make you grin!

, You might be surprised how much you have to smile for. You have a life full of adventures!

, Read stories about achievements, successes and bravery, and it should make you smile.
 Study for a test and pass, donate to charity, or do a sponsored run; whatever it is, it should leave you tingling with a feeling of 'I did something good'. Nothing makes you smile more!

, and you know how happily you react and interact with your best friend with relaxed and happy smiles.


Don't talk about your smiling techniques to new friends, or you will seem odd and off-base.

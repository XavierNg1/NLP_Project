 Think of how touched your friend will be to get a note passed in class that simply says, "Hey, I haven't told you in a while but I really do appreciate our friendship."

, Make sure it's one that you wouldn't mind too much if they revealed, since sharing secrets builds trust. If the person tells the secret, you will not have lost much (because you did not mind this secret getting out), but you will have learned that they cannot be trusted as your best friend. If the person keeps the secret, you can tell another slightly larger secret. Soon, your friend may build a track record of trust by keeping all of your secrets, and you will know that this is a person you can share your deepest thoughts with.
 Best friendships require honesty, even more than regular ones do.


Secrets which you hold back about your friend may come out at a bad time and can have a serious negative effect on your friend.
 In a good friendship, your friend will be as honest with you as you are with them, so don't make bold assumptions about the way they might think about you. Most of the time, if you're thinking it's something bad, then you're wrong! If this person is a true friend he or she will love you and be honest with you.

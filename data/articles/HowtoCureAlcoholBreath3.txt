 Drinking moderately rather than binge drinking can lessen the smell of alcohol. Try to stick to a few drinks over the course of the evening. Binge drinking can not only result in a strong smell but other health problems, especially when done frequently. Cutting back on drinking, and not drinking to get drunk, can help prevent alcohol breath.


Try to stick to drinking only two drinks per sitting.
 Different drinks have different odors. If you mix a variety of types of alcohol, this can make the overall odor worse. Stick to one type of alcohol you like for the night as this can lessen alcohol breath.
 Mixed drinks that contain herbs and spices can have a stronger odor than simple beer, wine, and liquor. Stick to simple drinks as this will lessen the smell of alcohol on your breath.

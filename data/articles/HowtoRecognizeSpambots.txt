Intelligent spam programs attempt to interpret what you say to the account they are using and make a response that seems relative to what you said. When the account you suspect is a computer program always makes very vague, generic responses (like horoscopes, responses that would cover a wide range of things) the account is likely being run by a program. Don't jump to conclusions though, as it may just be a user who has nothing to contribute (if that's any better).
Spam programs will sometimes answer questions that were never asked. For example, a 'user' may suddenly just post "Yes, I agree. You should keep doing what you're doing.", without anyone ever having argued or asked a question.
Some spam programs may spontaneously state something they 'like'. An example of this would be a group of users having a conversation about computer security, and another 'user' suddenly says "I love the latest Croc sandals. I bought them at crocsandalscheap.com for a good price!"
Spam programs will never really participate in a conversation or directly talk to another user. This is because conversation between humans is really difficult to emulate and design an algorithm for. So the program's design prevents it from being obvious through making comments every now and then.

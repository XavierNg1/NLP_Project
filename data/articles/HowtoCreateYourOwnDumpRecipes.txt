 For example, raw chicken thighs, sliced celery, sliced carrots and peas, and a starch like diced potatoes or pasta with a sauce added, such as a can of condensed cream of chicken soup, would make a great dump recipe.


Remember to add additional liquid if you are including pasta in your recipe.;
, Here's how you should go about this process:


Select the central ingredient, whether it be meat or fish or a vegan equivalent.
Select the vegetables and other ingredients, such as pasta, to go with it.
Decide on the size each ingredient will be to put in the cooker.
 In fact, by searching for dump recipes, you may just come up with the ideal recipe you want and not have to create one yourself.
 Here's what you need to know:


Stove cooking recipes containing chicken should take about 1/2 hour if at the boil.
A pressure cooker will take less time - perhaps 10 minutes on pressure.
A crockpot will take many hours - 4 hours on high and 6-8 hours on low.
 This can help you repeat the delicious recipe at a later date, or to share it with friends. And who knows, you may come up with a Dump Meal Recipe Book of your very own. Currently, there are very few books like this available, and you could start a trend!

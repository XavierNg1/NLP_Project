The basic challenge for an unfamiliar driver will be that it is not left-hand turns which are problematic. Simply be in the left-hand lane, obey any traffic signals and a left-turn is easy.;
, Speed limits vary between different types of roads and the areas that you are in.
 You can never turn left on a red.
 The rule here is simple. Approach, slow down, and look to your right. If you see a car, stop before entering the roundabout - that car is more than likely going to pass you (it's 2 of the 3 options). As you become more accustomed to LHS driving, you'll learn to look for the other car's indicator. If it's flashing a right hand turn, it won't be in your path and you are good to go on. But always slow down and remember that even the locals get very conservative on multiple lane roundabouts.
 At large intersections, a 'right turn arrow' may appear giving you right of way. At intersections without an arrow, it is permissible to creep into the middle (so long as you don't obstruct anyone ... just slowly move into a 'ready to turn' position). It's not uncommon to just 'sit' for up to a minute in this spot. A break in traffic will come, but you are also allowed to 'turn on the red' if you are already in the intersection. That is, as oncoming traffic (and the flow-through behind you) stops to observe the new red light, you can hurry on through with your right turn before the intersecting traffic begins to move.

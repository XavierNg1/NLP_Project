 Most cases of car sickness can be dealt with using lifestyle changes and home remedies. However, sometimes car sickness can get in the way of your job or everyday functioning. In this case, you should talk to your doctor about possible medical interventions, such as over-the-counter or prescription medication.


You should also talk to your doctor if you (or your child) experience symptoms well after you have gotten out of the car, severe headache, difficulty hearing or seeing, and difficulty walking. These could indicate issues that are more serious than regular car sickness.Susceptibility to car sickness may be related to age, race, sex, hormone factors, sensory illness, and migraines. Ask your doctor if you have an elevated risk for motion sickness., There are over-the-counter and prescription drugs that are effective against car sickness. Most of them contain dimenhydrinate (aka dramamine) or meclizine.Some popular brands are Dramamine and Bonine/Antivert. Some of these are available as patches and can be particularly helpful because of their ability to release the medicine over time. Antihistamines can prevent nausea caused by motion sickness by dulling the inner ear's motion sensors. In order to work properly, you should take the medication 30-60 minutes before you begin your car trip.Look into the side effects before using any of these drugs (especially if you're driving), and ask your doctor just in case. Antihistamines can make you feel sleepy and affect your ability to operate machinery., Scopolamine is only safe for adult use--not for child use.It is prescription-only and is worn as a patch behind the ear. You must wear it 4 hours before your traveling commences. While its side effects can be severe (blurred vision and dry mouth), it is very effective at combating nausea caused by motion sickness.Talk to your doctor about whether it might be a good option for you.

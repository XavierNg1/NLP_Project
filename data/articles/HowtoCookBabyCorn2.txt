 Fill two-thirds of a small to medium saucepan with water. Bring that water to a boil over medium-high heat.


Meanwhile, fill a medium to large bowl with ice water. Set this bowl aside for later use.;
, Dunk the baby corn in the boiling water. After approximately 15 seconds, drain the water and remove the baby corn from the hot pan., Submerge the baby corn in the bowl of ice water. Keep the miniature cobs in the ice water for 30 to 60 seconds.


The ice water halts the cooking process and prevents the corn from getting any softer. When you feel the baby corn, it should still seem quite crisp.
 Drain the water and dry the baby corn. You can then serve the baby corn as it is or use it in other recipes.


You can toss blanched baby corn into salads, chilled pasta, or other cold dishes.
Similarly, you can add blanched baby corn to hot dishes during the last minute or so of cooking. Since the corn is already partially cooked, you won't need to continue cooking it much longer.

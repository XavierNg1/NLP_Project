 If your watch has stopped, you may need to change the battery. You can find watch batteries at Radio Shack or Walmart, or you may want to take your watch back to the place that you bought it for a professional fix.


You can potentially scratch your watch if you try to replace your battery yourself. However, if you do want to pry off the back of your watch, you can do so with a small flat-head jeweler’s screwdriver. Insert the tip of the screwdriver into the indentation or tab that separates the front and back of your watch. Tap it with a hammer or rubber mallet until the back comes off. You should then be able to replace the battery (use a non-metal object to remove and replace the battery) and the back of the watch.If your watch is solar powered or movement powered, you may need to charge it in the sun, or wear it for a day or two before it is ready to set.
 This is the small knob on the side of your watch.Depending on how complicated your watch is, you may have buttons instead of a crown.
 On some watches, the crown will pull out to multiple levels. Usually, one level will change the date, and another level will change the time.


Experiment by pulling the crown out to multiple levels and turning it. If it doesn’t affect the minute hand and hour hand, pull it out or push it in to a different level.
 Turn the crown until the minute hand and hour hand are pointing to the correct places.


Usually the minute and hour hands will move together.
 This will set the time, and your watch will start running again.


Make sure that crown is pushed all the way in. If you don’t push it all the way in, your watch will not restart.

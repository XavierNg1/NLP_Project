 This technique creates a series of white or lighter colored stripes vertically (top-to-bottom) through the color of your dye by rolling the fabric and tying it with fasteners. Horizontal stripes can also be made by rolling your fabric left-to-right instead of top to bottom., To create vertical (top-to-bottom) stripes, you should roll your fabric from its bottom to the top in a loose tube. For horizontal (left-to-right) stripes, you should roll your fabric in a loose tube from the left to the right., Use rubber bands or string to tie the cloth tube off at even intervals. If the spacing between your fasteners is uneven, the distance between your stripes will also be uneven.


Your stripes will form along the orientation of your rubber bands.
To ensure even striping, you might want to measure the space between your fasteners with a ruler and adjust as necessary. You could also measure out and mark your spacing beforehand.

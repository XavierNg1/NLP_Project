 Text messages will no longer be deleted after a certain amount of time and will be kept indefinitely.


Over time, messages will use up your storage space (both on the device and your iCloud storage).If you run out of space you may have trouble receiving new messages.
Other options will delete your messages after 30 days or one year. Giving your text messages a lifespan can help save storage space.
You can also delete message manually by tapping and holding a message bubble and tapping the trash can icon.

 As in the methods above, acetone will work wonderfully to dissolve glue on most glass surfaces. Soak a cotton swab in acetone and rub it directly onto the dried glue, then follow by rubbing with a rag. The glue should start to soften and come off with a few applications.


Don't use acetone on plexiglass and other glass alternatives made from plastic. Acetone will eat away at these materials over time, eventually dissolving them into a liquid (though this requires prolonged contact.)

, Another way to work crazy glue off of glass is to soak glass items in warm, soapy water. Scrub the glue gently with an old toothbrush or a gentle abrasive in the water. If you're careful not to scrape or gouge, you can even use a plastic putty knife to help chip the glue off. Be patient â€” over time, the glue should begin to flake away.


If two pieces of glass are stuck together, submerge both in warm soapy water. Let sit for at least 15-20 minutes. As the glue loosens, pry the glass objects apart cautiously. If you experience strong resistance, stop to avoid breaking the glass.
 While abrasives like sandpaper will leave glass so scratched and marred that it's no longer transparent, one gentle and unlikely abrasive is actually suitable for use on glass: toothpaste. To use toothpaste this way, follow the steps below:


Squeeze out toothpaste onto your finger and apply it to the glued area.
Start scrubbing with a sponge or a gentle wool cloth. Scrub for a couple of minutes until the glue softens.
Try to peel the glue of the object with your fingernail. If it's a small patch, it should start to lift off.
This method doesn't always work with really big patches of glue, but it does well when there are small spots of glue here and there.

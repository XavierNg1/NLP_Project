 Some educators and health care professionals may downplay the seriousness of selective mutism, or even suggest that your child will grow out of it; however, selective mutism is a serious problem that requires treatment. It is important for you to advocate for your child. Make sure that your child’s teacher is on the same page as your SLP regarding your child’s needs in the classroom, and that the teacher is encouraging, supportive, and willing to work with you and your child's SLP.For example, make sure that your child’s teacher knows not to gush or overreact if your child speaks in class., Some children will communicate using special devices, such as a voice recorder, a computer, or even just a pen and paper. Ask your child’s teacher what options are available for your child to use in the classroom.Your child might have a method of communicating that she prefers. Pay attention to how your child communicates when she is feeling anxious for clues on how to provide communication options to your child at school.
For example, if your child tends to draw when she is feeling anxious, then sending her with a special notepad and crayon set may help.
Your child and teacher may work out a way to communicate with non-verbal methods, such as signals or cards, before working up to speech., Some children with selective mutism will speak only in small group settings, so you may want to talk to your child’s teacher about this possibility.For example, if the students sometimes work in small groups to complete tasks, then perhaps your child’s teacher could ensure that your child is placed with the smallest size group or even just with one partner.

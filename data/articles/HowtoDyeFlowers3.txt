 Floral spray dye is very similar to spray paint, except that it is made so that it won’t kill fresh flowers and adheres to flower petals. Floral spray dye (or floral spray paint) comes in a variety of colors, and is safe to use on both fresh and dried flowers. Keep in mind that it can get quite messy, spray painting a bouquet of flowers.
 Spray dye is opaque when applied, and will completely cover the color of the flower petals underneath. As a result, you can use any color, shape, or species of flower you want.
 Using spray dye is messy business, so it is important that you set up a special work area to do it in. Move into a well-ventilated space – like your garage or driveway – and put down a drop cloth or newspapers. Put on rubber gloves and old clothes that you don’t mind getting a bit dirty and stained.
 With the lid still on, shake the can of spray dye well for 20-30 seconds. Remove the cap and turn the nozzle so that the black dot is aligned with the direction you want to spray.
 Hold each flower up individually, so that the bud is facing away from you. With your other hand, hold the can of spray dye 15–18 inches (38.1–45.7 cm) away from the flower bud. Hold down the nozzle to release the dye, turning the flower as you do so to spray it evenly. Spray the flower until it is completely covered with an even coat of paint.
 Put the freshly painted flower into a vase or other container that holds it upright. The dye will take 1-3 hours to dry depending on the temperature and humidity. Don’t touch the flowers until they are completely dried, or else the dye will rub off onto your hands and clothes.


Put the flowers in a warm, dry room to help them dry faster.
 Continue working through your bouquet, spraying each flower individually and then putting it in a vase to dry. You can add multiple coats of the dye to the flowers if you aren’t happy with the density or brightness of the color.

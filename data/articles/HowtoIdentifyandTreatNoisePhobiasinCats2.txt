 It is normal for loud noises to make your cat anxious, but you should take your cat to the veterinarian if its behavior changes suddenly. If it begins to hurt itself, tries to escape, shows signs of diarrhea, or begins destroying property, you should also take your cat to the veterinarian., Some medications, like Amitriptyline, Prozac, and Buspirone, can be administered throughout a long, stressful period, like storm season. It can take 3-4 weeks for these medications to take effect, so they wonâ€™t be useful in emergency situations, but can help during prolonged periods of stressful noise., There are other medications that are too powerful to administer to your cat on a regular basis, but which you can give to your cat directly before a period of loud noise to calm it down. These include Alprazolam and Valium.

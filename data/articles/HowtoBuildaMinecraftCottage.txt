 You need a flat roof, some dirt, ladders for getting up there (stairs are too cramped) water, fences and seeds. Lay out the fences along the edge of your roof, so you won't fall off.
 Make a deep (at least 3 blocks) hole underneath the floor, add ladders so you can climb down. Then start a tunnel leading to a secret room! Maybe a pool, a doghouse, a cool bedroom- anything you want! Remember, since this is a secret tunnel, nobody but you should know where it is.
 Place logs one block outwards from where they were in the beginning. You should now have a one-block space in between the corners of your house. Extend the roof to these logs. Underneath this new roof space is a good spot to add flowers.

 Vinegar is a mild acid that has great effect on stains. Pour a small quantity of vinegar into a bowl. Soak a clean, soft cloth in the vinegar. Wring out the excess.
 Apply the vinegar cloth and gently attempt to buff out the stains. Move the cloth in circular motions with a gentle touch to avoid stressing the nickel as much as possible. Re-soak the cloth as needed., For stubborn stains, you may need to soak the nickel plating. Combine four parts water with one part vinegar in a container that will either contain the nickel piece or hold enough solution to put on the stains.Do not use straight vinegar. It is often too abrasive to expose to thin nickel coatings for extended periods.
Nickel plating is easily damaged by acid, so vinegar cleaning should be done sparingly on stubborn stains.
You can heat up your mixture to give it a little more cleaning power if you desire. This should only be done if the object wonâ€™t be soaked in it.
 Soak the nickel-plated item in the solution for several hours. The stains should have begun to lift. Alternatively, pour the vinegar solution over the object and let it rest for 30 minutes. Repeat as necessary.
 Use warm running water or apply a soft cloth dampened in water. Make sure all the vinegar is gone. Vinegar left on the plating will continue to wear away at it. Wipe with a second cloth if necessary to make sure it is all gone.

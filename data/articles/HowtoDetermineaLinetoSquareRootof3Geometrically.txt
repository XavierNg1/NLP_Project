,, Both top and bottom, with straight lines will form two equilateral triangles, one atop the other, the bottom one an inverted mirror image of the top triangle. All the radii are equal and all sides being equal, these are proven equilateral triangles.
 The length of this line equals the square root of 3.
 Where the perpendicular cuts the original given unit line to the line's left (or right) endpoint is a distance of .5 -- let us call this distance a. a^2 = .25. The hypotenuse has a length of 1; let us call the hypotenuse c and c^2 = 1. c^2 - a^2 = b^2 = 1 - .25 = 3/4 and the square root of this is sqrt(3)/2 and equals 1/2 the dropped perpendicular between the intersection points, top and bottom, of the two circles. Therefore twice this distance, or the measure of the full perpendicular between the circle's intersection points, equals sqrt(3)/2 * 2 which = the square root of 3 ... the very distance which was sought to be determined geometrically.
 Sqrt(3) = 1.73205080756888 and we can see the black line is about 2*.85 or 1.7 units in length, roughly.

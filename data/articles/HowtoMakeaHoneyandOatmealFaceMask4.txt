 The facemasks you have made will be very gloopy and messy. Consider draping a towel over the front of your chest and shoulders to protect your clothes. You can also wear something that you do not mind getting dirty.
 While the ingredients you have used are not bad for your hair, you will probably have to wash your hair completely if you get any of the oatmeal mask on it. To prevent this, tie your hair into a pony tail to keep it away from your face. If you have short hair, then consider wearing a shower cap.
 If you have not already, wash your face with your usual facial cleanser and water. Lightly pat your face dry with a clean towel.
 Using your fingers, start gently massaging the mask into your face, using circular motions. Apply the mask into your forehead, nose, cheekbones, and jaw. Do not apply it on your mouth or eyes.
 Let the mask sit on your face for 10 to 15 minutes. If you are using the soothing, yogurt-based mask, consider leaving the mask on for 15 to 20 minutes instead. The mask may harden or start to flake off as it dries; this is normal and to be expected.


While waiting for your mask to dry, consider taking a relaxing bath or soak.
 Using cool water, gently wash the face mask off. Be sure to use the same circular, massaging motions that you used to put the mask on.
 Once your face is clean, follow up with your usual skincare regime. If you don't have a skincare regime, them you can consider applying some toner and moisturizer.


To apply the toner, simply soak a cotton ball with some toner, and sweep it over your face, focusing on the forehead, nose, and cheekbones. The toner will help tighten your pores.
To apply some moisturizer, simply squeeze some of your favorite facial moisturizer onto your palm, and apply it to your face using your fingers. Avoid the sensitive areas around your nose and mouth.

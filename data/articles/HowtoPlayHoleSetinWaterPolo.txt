 You want to push your defender back, with your hips out in front of you. When the ball is passed, this enables you to step out to it and score. In times when you cannot score, you also have the option of turning your defender. If you can successfully put the defender on your back, the referee will reward your team with an ejection or a 5-meter. A hole set can also take a foul and allow for the 2 and 4 positions to drive.;
, There are several types:


Sweep -- The ball is cradled using your wrist and released after a quick turn. The key to this shot is quickness.
Backhand -- Hold the ball with your wrist pointing forward and you release it quickly. This shot is best taken when the pass comes in from the flat and you are positioned on the far post so you have entire cage.
Lay-out. This shot requires the player to step out to the ball and then come forward to shoot. A defender may reach forward to block the ball. In this situation, you can fake a shot and turn them or you may change your angle of shooting. For instance lean back, then wait for the defender's move. Once he moves, move your upper body left. This confuses the goalie and the defense. But remember, quickness is the key for success.
Opposite Hand -- work on picking the ball up and shooting with your opposite hand. If the defender knows that you are right handed, he will most likely shade your strong side leaving you open to make a move to shoot with your left hand.
 Make sure your hand is positioned below the water and that your movement is not very aggressive.
 It's always easier to get a shot off out of 2 meters (6.6Â ft) if you shoot on the 2nd or 3rd pass into set. If you don't have a good shot, take the foul or dish the ball to the perimeter.

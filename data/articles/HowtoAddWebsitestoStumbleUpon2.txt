Choose a topic. Designate the website's topic by choosing from popular topics that are already highlighted or select a different topic from the pull-down menu.
Add tags or keywords. You may enter up to 5 tags or keywords that include spaces to help the website appear in StumbleUpon search results. Make sure commas are used to separate the tags.
Add a review. Type in a brief or detailed review of the website you are adding.
Select the language. Indicate the language the website is written in. The "No Language" option can be chosen for pictures, videos, or websites without text. When you are finished choosing a language, click on "Add Review" to complete the process of adding the website to StumbleUpon.

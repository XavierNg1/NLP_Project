 Try not to offer criticism to someone right after he or she has done something. If possible offer some praise and then provide criticism a little later. This will give you a chance to think about the best way to phrase your criticism and increase the chances that it will be well-received. You may even want to wait to share criticism until it is absolutely necessary. For example, if you have some criticism for someone who has just given a presentation, then you might consider waiting until a day or two before their next presentation to share the criticism.
 This is often called the sandwich method of offering criticism. To use this method, you would say something nice, then offer the criticism, and then close with another nice comment.For example, you might say something like, “Your presentation was fascinating! I had a little trouble following the content sometimes due to the pace, but I think if you slow the next one down it will be amazing!”

, Starting your criticism with “you” can send the message that you are looking for an argument and put the other person on the defensive. Instead of leading with “you,” try to start your criticism with “I.”For example, instead of saying, “You always interrupt me when I am talking,” say something like, “I feel frustrated when I am talking and I get interrupted.”

, Another good way to provide criticism to someone is to phrase your criticism in the form of a future request. This is not as severe as making a statement about something someone has just done or as asking someone to completely change their behavior.For example, instead of saying, “You always leave your socks on the floor!” you might say something like “In the future, can you please pick up your socks and put them into the hamper?”

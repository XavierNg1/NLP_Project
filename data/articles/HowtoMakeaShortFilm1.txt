 Are you making a narrative or documentary? Comedy or action? That is something you need to think about when starting your short film's script. A good screenwriting website is Celtx.com


If you are planning to make a fiction film, then it's narrative. Think of a basic story idea. You can get ideas for films from things you read in daily life, short stories, newspapers, etc.;
, Write out your script, using Celtx; if you have never written a script before, pick up a book that explains script writing and character development, and that—along with the Celtx program—will be all you will need.
 Begin this by thinking of the names of the characters, the time of the story (Is it 10 years from now? Is it a hundred years before our time?), think of it how the story starts.
, Decide what each shot in the movie is going to be. For example, wide shot, over the shoulder, tracking shot, close up, extreme close up, medium wide shot. crane shot, dolly shot, etc.
 This is called a breakdown sheet.
 Is it external (EXT) or internal (INT)?

,,,, Look for actors. Try looking for actors in your neighborhood, your school, anywhere. Your actors could be your friends, your family members, your classmates. Hold auditions for your actors. Make sure when you audition your them, they are right for the character, they should have similar attitudes, they should pretend they are the character they are portraying. That way, you could have the right person for the job and won't be able to mess their character during your production filming. For crew you are going to need as many people as possible, but at least the following:

Camera person






Director of photography






Sound recorder






Costume and makeup person.






Craft service






Someone who knows something about lighting






A PA.

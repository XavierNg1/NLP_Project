 Although you should usually wait 2-4 days to mist them again, this may be different for each succulent. If you're not sure how often to mist yours, a good rule of thumb is to wait until the soil is dry to mist it again.
 When the succulents are young it is critical to stick to a strict misting schedule., This practice establishes a healthy root system., There is no standard answer to how often to water mature succulents. This will depend on the plant variety, the soil, the ambient humidity, and other factors. Generally, you should water more often in the summer when the plant is actively growing than in the winter when the plant goes into semi-dormancy with shorter days., Sometimes it is beneficial to skip watering for 1-2 days to allow even stronger roots to grow. Contrary to popular belief, you don't always have to stick to the same watering schedule for mature succulents. Still, it is good to have a general schedule., Your succulents are probably under-watered if:

the upper leaves are becoming dry and crispy
the entire plant has become shriveled (although it is difficult to revive it at this point)
many leaves are shriveling at the tips

, This will help transition them to a regular watering routine. Giving them a 'full dose' of water after a long period of time without water might damage the plants., After they have gotten used to the change, gradually return to their regular watering schedule. You can then water them with a watering can, and they should be back to normal in 1-3 weeks!

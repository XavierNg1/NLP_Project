 If you want to bake with a sugar substitute, you may not be able to eliminate all the sugar. However, you can significantly reduce the amount of sugar in your recipe by substituting half the sugar with an alternative.When doing this, cut about ¼ cup of the liquid element in the recipe.
You can try applesauce, pureed dates or other fruit, or mashed bananas.
 Fruit desserts can be delicious and sweet without the added sugar. Follow the recipe the same way, but eliminate all the additional sugar. You may even consider adding more fruit for extra fruit sweetness or tartness.This can be done for pies, cobblers, tarts, parfaits, or any other fruit-based dessert.
 Not all of these options will be right for you. You may not like the taste of one of them. That doesn’t mean you should go back to sugar. Instead, keep trying sugar alternatives until you find the one that is right for you. You also may find that some natural sweeteners are better in certain recipes or types of baked goods than others.


For example, you may hate the taste of pureed prunes and maple syrup, but love shredded beets in cakes and muffins sweetened with bananas.
If you cannot figure out how to sweeten with these alternatives, there are many recipes and cookbooks that contain baked goods made with natural alternatives.

, Focus. When casting any spell, it is good to have a clear purpose before you start. This way, you avoid a lot of mistakes later. Do you have a justifiable reason for casting this spell (something besides personal gain)? For what are you casting your binding spell? Is there anything you need to set up beforehand to cast the spell correctly?

, This will vary depending on your spell.
 Most spells start with a chant. An example for a binding spell that protects you would be: "I bind you (name), your work, your voice and your chants. The work you did against me will not affect me."


For the spell that completes the above chant, light a red candle or a white one. You do not need both; the red candle is preferable if you have it.
 Say, "I bind you; I stop your spell." Tie one knot in the rope.
 Tie another knot in the rope.
 Blow out the candle. Imagine the spell cast on you is vanishing with the smoke. It is gone.
 Its purpose is to protect you. Every spell will be different, with a different purpose, but most will begin with lighting a candle and end with blowing it out. Most will require something like the rope to hold what you are binding. The chant varies depending on what you are binding.

 In some instances you may be required to produce a written affidavit of residence to go along with the other forms of proof you are submitting, such as a utility bill or government issued ID card. An affidavit is an official statement from you which is made under oath, or is attested to under penalty of perjury, that certifies your residency. That means that this is a legal document, which if faked, can lead to a prosecution., For an affidavit of residence you will typically need to write your address, state that you are a full-time resident, and say when your residency began. There are templates available online which give you the essential outline of an affidavit of residency.


An example of the text could be: "I, the undersigned (full legal name) hereby certify that I live at (address) and have been resident there since (date residency began)."You need to use your full legal name in the affidavit.
Write it in a formal style and ensure it is presented clearly and professionally.
 Often you will be required to get the affidavit notarized before it is accepted as proof of residency.A Notary Public is an independent individual who verifies that you have signed the affidavit and it is genuine.You will find notaries in local government offices and mailing counters. You can search online for notaries operating near you.


When you go to the notary you will need to bring identification with you so be sure you know what to bring before you go.
Don't sign the affidavit before you go, your notary needs to witness you doing this.

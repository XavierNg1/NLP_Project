 Find your favorite local cause and volunteer. Finding organizations that are meaningful to you can increase your morale. It can also help you meet people who have similar interests and the same kind of passion you find in yourself.


You can find local volunteer organizations through your school, local community, religious institution, online, or through a friend.
 By applying for an internship program, you can get real world experience while doing the things you are passionate about. Remember that experience dating back to your high school years looks great on any job application. It shows that you are focused and dedicated; qualities that employers look for.


Start by looking for local businesses and organizations in your areas of interest and see if they offer internship programs. You can search online, or ask a counselor, teacher, coach, or club advisor. You can also find out if family or friends know someone in a field that interests you. , Today, geeks and nerds are becoming increasingly fashionable. The mainstreaming of geek culture has even resulted in geek protagonists. Just think of Seth Cohen in the TV series “The OC,” or the protagonists in the popular TV series “The Big Bang Theory.” Embrace your inner nerd or geek by celebrating “Embrace Your Geekness Day” with your friends on July 13th.
Plan to get together with your group of friends once a month to celebrate your interests and differences.

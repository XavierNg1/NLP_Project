 Mac OS X includes the ability to create PDFs without any additional software or special programs. Just open the PDF file in whatever program you normally would.
 You can find this in the "File" menu or by pressing âŒ˜ Command+P.
 This will open a new window.
 You can name your new PDF whatever you'd like and select where you want to save it.

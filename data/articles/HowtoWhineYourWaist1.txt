 To start whining, stand on a flat surface. Hold your feet about shoulder-length apart. Keep your feet flat on the ground to maintain your balance., To start getting the feel of whining, simply roll your waist in a circle. Do not try to incorporate too much movement. Just get used to the feel of moving your waist while keeping the rest of your body still.Strive to make a small circle. You can move in either a clockwise or counter clockwise direction.
Go as slowly as you need to go to pick up on the movement. It can take awhile to get used to moving your waist while keeping your shoulders and torso in place.
Keep circling your hips slowly until you feel confident in the motion.
 Once you have a feel for the basic motion, you can lower your body down slightly. Bend your knees just a bit so your waist sinks down to the floor. Go as low as you feel comfortable. Then, move your body back up by un-bending your knees. Keep circling your waist the entire time.

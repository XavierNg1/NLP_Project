 Verify what your bag is made from cotton, bamboo, polypropylene, or hemp. Bags made from these materials should be machine washable. Check the tag to verify the recommended cleaning method.


These bags can also be washed by hand, should you choose to do so.
 These bags can be washed in the laundry machine with laundry detergent. They should generally be washed on a gentle cycle with cold water. Cotton bags are the exception; they can be washed with hot water on a regular cycle., Cotton, bamboo, and hemp bags can be dried on a regular setting in a clothâ€™s dryer. This is easier than air drying and poses less threat of moisture remaining on the bag after drying., Air drying is safe for all types of bags. So, if your bag is made of polypropylene, or if you are unsure what it is made of, allow it to air dry. Hang it up and give it approximately 24 hours to dry. Be sure that it dries completely.

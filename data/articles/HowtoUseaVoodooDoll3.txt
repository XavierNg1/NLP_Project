 While the colored pins can be used on a voodoo doll of yourself or someone else for good, some can also be used for evil. For example, if you wish to exert power over an individual, use the red pin, focus on the power you want the individual to submit to, and prick the voodoo doll of the individual in the head.
 Using the voodoo doll that represents the spirit you wish to call upon, create an alter for your doll, focus on the person you wish to harm or cause misfortune to, and petition the spirit to act on your behalf. In the same way as you would petition a spirit for yourself, light a candle that corresponds to the spirit and possibly offer a sacrifice.
 If you wish to invoke harm upon someone through a voodoo doll representing them, you can use regular pins or needles, rope, wire, water, or any sort of torture device you wish. Then, following the focusing technique, concentrate on the person you wish to harm and the actions you are carrying out.


Make sure you clear the doll of all previous energies. If the doll is in any way associated with someone else, they may experience the harm as well and you wouldn't want that!
Most experienced practitioners of Voodoo suggest only to use your doll for good, because as the saying goes "what goes around comes around."

 If the rapist feels that they and the victim are alone, they may think they can get away with more violence. There is a chance that they have weapons and are willing to use them.
 If the rapist has any shred of decency buried somewhere deep inside, your obvious surprise and disgust will make them stop. If not, be loud to get attention. Shouting "Fire!" or "My baby, my baby!" is more likely to make people come running.


"What the heck are you doing?"
"What is going on here?"

, You getting hurt will not save the victim. If you haven't been seen, hide in a safe place and call the police.
 If a car is involved, what color and make is it, and what is its license plate? Where exactly are you? How much of the rapist did/can you see, so that you can identify them later?

, The victim may be conscious, semi-conscious, or passed out completely from alcohol or date rape drugs. If they are crying or visibly upset, comfort them as best as you can. Ask how you can help, and explain that you have called the police.


Lay an unconscious victim on their side so that if they vomit, they will not choke.
 You may be interviewed to help document the crime and provide important information. Watching them take over may make you feel helpless. This is normal, and you did the best you could. You were brave, and now the officials will handle the aftermath.

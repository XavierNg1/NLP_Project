 The best areas for building a tarp shelter are places that have flat ground. This can make creating the shelter a bit easier and will allow you a more comfortable place to sleep in. Take some time to find a nice, flat area before building your tarp shelter., Once you've found a nice place on the ground for your shelter, you will want to look above it. Dead branches can pose a serious hazard to campers if they are knocked down by wind. Always avoid placing your shelter under any branches that look old, dead, or dangerous to avoid having one fall on you., Many tarp shelter designs require you to place a sturdy cord or rope between two trees. This cord will act as the ridge-line for your tarp shelter. It's a good idea to look for a flat spot that has two trees for you to place this cord between.If you can't find two trees, you could try placing two anchor branches in the ground instead.
These trees should be roughly as far apart as your tarp is long.
 Although it may be sunny and dry when you set your tarp shelter up, the weather may change during your camping trip. It's important to consider what the weather might do in the near future, allowing you to stay comfortable and avoid any damage to your tarp shelter.Figure out which way the winds are blowing. Any “wall” of your tarp shelter should face away from the wind.
Avoid putting your shelter in any areas that are low or seem like they could flood during rain storms.

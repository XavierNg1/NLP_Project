 For tiny rose buds, use strips of tissue paper cut to size. To create larger rosettes, find a pretty crepe paper you like. You can use any color, print, or texture of paper that you would like.
 You will need to work with strips of paper 2-5 inches (5-12.5 cm) wide. To create a small rose, use paper that is less than 12 inches (30.5 cm) long. For a larger rose, use paper cut to length longer than 12 inches (30.5 cm).
 Lay your paper out flat, and fold the top ¼ of it down across the length. This will create a long strip that is now ¾ size rather than full size. Folding down the top part will give your roses full, smooth-edged petals.
 Pick up your paper from one end, and create a small spiral by rolling the paper inwards. Pinch the base of the flower to form the bud.
 Continue rolling the flower up along the paper until you have rolled it all up. Twist the bottom section to form the base and use scissors to round the edge to give it a natural shape (rather than a squared off appearance).
 Wrap a bit of florists wire around the twisted base to hold the flower together. You can cut the wire short and attach your rose to any decorative object, or cut the wire long and use it as a faux-stem.
 Enjoy your pretty tissue roses!

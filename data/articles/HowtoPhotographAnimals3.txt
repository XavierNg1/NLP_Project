 In order to create a sense of intimacy in your photos you should physically lower your angle to capture the animal’s perspective. This strategy also makes it easier to get eye contact with the animal, which will help make the shots more personal., Before photographing a pet consider what makes the pet unique and how you can reflect their character through photos. For example, photograph the pet engaging in their favourite activity, be it napping or playing fetch.Similarly, if you are photographing wild animals, consider their unique behaviours and features, and try to emphasize them in your photos.
 Capturing close-up, face shots of animals can be a great style for portraits. This tight angle, creates an intimacy and allows you to make eye contact through the photo. Also consider wider angles to display the surrounding landscape.

A wider angle will allow you to show the animal in a larger context. For example, a wider angle shot of a buffalo grazing in a field, captures the habitat and reality of a plains buffalo., Pets and domestic animals have a strong connection to people. Photographing a pet with their owner is a great way to capture that bond.Photos of animals with people can be taken as staged portraits or as candids., Pets are often trained, allowing for staged photos, unlike wild animals. However, it is good to take both staged and candid shots to accurately capture the animal through photos.When taking staged photos, try to get close up shots with eye contact. You can use their toys or treats to direct their vision toward the camera.Candid photos come across as more natural and are a fun way to capture the animal’s individuality.

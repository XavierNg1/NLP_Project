 First, check to see if your child’s pencil or pencil grip is comfortable. If something is rubbing uncomfortably against your child’s hand, it may be as simple as trying a new type of pencil.
 If you have tried the above methods and nothing seems to be working, consider talking to your child’s teacher or pediatrician about bringing them to an occupational therapist for additional fine motor skill testing and training. The lack of proper pencil holding can be a sign for other developmental delays, so it is important to catch the problem early and start your child right from the start.
 It may seem easier to just start a child early and begin teaching them the correct pencil holding technique as soon as they can hold a pencil or crayon, but that can have adverse effects. Toddlers and younger children have a difficult time holding a pencil in the correct tripod grip because their shoulder and arm muscles are still developing and steadying.
 When a toddler begins coloring, they will put a crayon in the fist grasp and use their shoulder muscles. As the shoulder muscles grow, most children naturally move to a grip with the pencil in the palm of their hand while wrapping all of their fingers around the pencil. From there they move on to the immature 5-finger grasp and then eventually the 3-finger grasp.


Let your child naturally work their way through the different grasps before you step in to intervene. Although most children won’t make it to the 3-finger grasp completely without help, it will help their development to let them figure it out most of the way on their own.

 There are many versions, regular (Photoshop 6, Photoshop 7), elements (Photoshop Elements 7.0 is the newest) and CS. Cs is the very expensive, around $800. Elements is great for beginners because it costs less than $100 and it includes most of the features you will need to use.;
,,, This can be accomplished a few ways. The most basic is just "auto-fixing" it. If you are more experienced with Photoshop, there are alternative ways. What you are trying to do here is get rid of shine and redness.
 Grab the clone stamp tool, hit alt where the skin looks good near the pimple, and then draw over the pimple. Do this as much as you want to all the pimples.
 If they are over the eyelashes or eyebrows, it is too tricky to get rid of them, so just leave them there- no one will notice.
 Select your forehead, top of your nose, cheeks, and chin. Go to filter - blur - Gaussian blur. Blur your selection so that the skin looks perfectly smooth, but not too much that it doesn't look realistic. Play around with it a little! If you have freckles, do not select them.
, Get your free selection tool, and feather it to 1-5px depending on your image. Select the whites of both eyes. Go to brighten/contrast, and brighten them.
 Take your burn tool and burn the outside of the colored part of your eye. Take the dodge tool and dodge the inner part, outlining the black (but not touching it). If you want to change the color, then select the colored part with your elliptical select (the circle one) and open a new layer. Fill it with the color you want. Experiment with the layer setting - soft light, overlay, anything you want.
 You do not want ever to make it black and white, as this will look terrible. It is a very amateur mistake. There are some great in depth tutorial on youtube for it though.

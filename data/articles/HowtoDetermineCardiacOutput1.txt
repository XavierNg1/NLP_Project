 The heart rate is simply the number of heartloads of blood that are ejected from the heart per unit of time.Typically we measure heart rate by beats per minute. Measuring your heart rate is simple, but before attempting it, make sure you have an accurate device to count the seconds.

You can attempt to keep track of the the beats and seconds in your head, but this could be inaccurate because the beats you count tend to overpower oneâ€™s inner clock..
It is better to set a timer, so you can focus on counting the beats. Try using the timer on your cell phone.;
, Although there are many places on your body where you can find a pulse, the inner wrist is usually an easy place to find it. An alternative is on the side of your throat, on the jugular vein area. Once you have identified your pulse and have a clear beat, take the forefinger and middle finger of one hand and place them over the area where you can feel the pulse.Usually the pulse is strongest on the inside of the wrist, in a line drawn down from the index finger, within two inches past the first crease of the wrist.
You may need to move your fingers around a bit to find your heartbeat.
You may also need to apply a little pressure to feel it. However, if you have to press too hard, then this is probably not a good spot. Try a different spot instead.
 Once you find your heartbeat, start your stopwatch or look at your clock with the second hand, wait until the second hand reaches the 12, and begin counting the beats. Count the beats for one minute (until the second hand returns to the 12). The total number of beats per minute is your heart rate.

If you find it difficult to count your heartbeats for an entire minute, you can count for 30 seconds (until the second hand reaches the 6) and then multiply that number by two.
Or you can count for 15 seconds and multiply it by four.

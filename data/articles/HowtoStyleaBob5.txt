 There are many products today that are specially created to achieve this look. Sea salt sprays are popular, as are other similar products.


If you do not currently own a product, then be sure to go to your local drugstore and buy one.
 There are mixed reviews about which works best: adding beachy waves to completely dry hair or to hair that is still a little damp.You will have to determine what works best for your hair.


It would be helpful to read the instructions on the texturizing product you own, as well.
 Be sure to spray all over your head. You can flip your head upside-down, as well, to reach the hair at the back of your neck.
 For some people, the scrunching method works well to help them achieve the “beachy waves.”


Gather small sections of hair in the palms of your hands and gently push upward toward your scalp. Slowly and gently close your hand around the hair as you push to scrunch it.
This might work better and add more volume to your hair if you flip your head upside-down to scrunch.
 If the scrunching method does not work for you, you can consider adding slight waves to your hair with a curling wand after spritzing the texturizing product.Wrap 2-inch sections of hair loosely around the wand, no more than 2-3 times, so that it creates waves rather than curls. Work all the way around your head in 2-inch chunks of hair. Check for any straight strands that linger and wrap them around the wand.
Be sure to hold your fingers away from the curling wand when holding the ends of the hair so that you do not burn your fingers.
 After you scrunch or curl, gently run your fingers through your hair to loosen the waves. Then, add more texturizing spray to finish and hold the waves.


You could spritz your hair with hairspray, instead of more texturizing product, if you would like a better hold.

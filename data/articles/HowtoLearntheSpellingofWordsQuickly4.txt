 Reading will improve your spelling without you even realizing it. Each word you read is another reminder of how that word is spelled. And as the exercises above showed, even knowing how to spell simple words can help you spell words you've never seen before.


When you find a word you don't know, spell it out loud. Write down the word a few times.
 When you find a useful or interesting word while reading, in conversation, or in class, write it down. Every day, write down each word on your list three times and spell it out loud. Literally one minute of this "studying" each day will teach you the spelling quite quickly. Remove words from the list once you're confident you know the spelling. Add new words to replace them.
 If your phone or computer correct your spelling for you, you're missing a chance to reinforce the correct spellings. Turn off this feature so you don't reinforce bad habits by entering the wrong spelling repeatedly.

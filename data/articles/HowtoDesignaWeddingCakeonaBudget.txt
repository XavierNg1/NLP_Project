 This can be difficult sometimes because local bakery shops usually have their own styles and one-of-a-kind cake designs. Sometimes your best bet is to look up wedding cake galleries online and then take a design you find online (printed out) to your local bakery.;
, These are another great source of ideas. If you can't afford the wedding magazines and books, there are many ways to find them without having to spend a lot of money. Go the library or a bookstore and look through designs. Look in thrift stores; wedding magazines are often available for next-to-nothing once other people's weddings are done!

, This way you won't get in over your head and buy too much cake. To help you get a budget in mind, you will need an accurate head-count of the number of guests so you know how much cake to buy.
 Once you have decided on the cake, make sure to get everything in writing from the baker and then call the baker a couple of weeks before the wedding to make sure everything is on track. Don't leave anything to chance! It is a good idea to get in touch with the baker a week before your wedding and go over the details again. Make sure the baker understands exactly what you want and will deliver it on time; you don't want to get the cake and find a word is misspelled on the cake! This may seem like a small detail but with a little effort on your part it can be avoided. So remember to pay attention to the small details and don't feel overwhelmed, just take it one small task at a time.

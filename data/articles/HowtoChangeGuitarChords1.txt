 Make sure you can play the chords smoothly on their own. Strum each note of the chord individually, making sure they don't buzz or sound dead. If you can play each note in a chord cleanly every time, then changing chords will be easy. For this article, you can practice with any chords you want. For starters, you might work on shifting back and forth between a C and a G-major chord, two of guitars most common chords.

, Keep your wrist relaxed and lightly bent, as if you were cupping an apple in your hand. A relaxed wrist and fingers are key to moving quickly and easily along the fretboard. Your elbow should be tucked in, towards your ribs instead of splayed out, and your strumming hand should be able to move freely from the wrist.









A relaxed body can move more fluidly, smoothly, and quickly.
Your fretting wrist (your left hand, for right-handed players) isn't kinked in front or behind of the neck, it is almost perpendicular to the frets, if not leaned a bit forward.
 The small, hard spot on the tip of your finger is infinitely more precise than the fleshy pad. For faster, smoother transitions, always fret with the tips, curling your fingers away from the guitar to make it easier to land on the fingertips.









If you can't reach the frets comfortably with your fingertips, raise your left knee (for right-handed players) to lean the guitar upwards, classical style. The upward angle makes it easier to get your fingers around the neck.
 If you're playing a note on the 3rd fret, you could technically be anywhere between the second and third frets with your fingers. But you'll get the most consistent, even sound if you're as close to the back of the 3rd fret as possible. Always try to creep closer to the fret you're trying to play for the cleanest transitions and chords.
 Chords take a lot of strength for beginning guitarists. So don't get discouraged when you have difficulties at first -- all guitarists need to build the physical skills as well as the musical skills of playing. The best way to build strength is to keep playing.









Play a tough chord, remove your hand, then play the chord again. Keep repeating this on-off pattern to get faster and stronger with quick chords.
Close your eyes to think about what a chord "feels" like. Can your fingers get there without your eyes?

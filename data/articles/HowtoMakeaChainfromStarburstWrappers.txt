 You will need a lot of Starburst wrappers. Seven wrappers will make approximately 2 inches (5cm) of chain.









If you want the chain to be shinier, replace the wrappers with shiny ones, like mint wrappers; or intersperse the Starburst wrappers with mint wrappers.
Add some color variety to your chain. Buy different flavors of Starburst with different wrapper colors or fold them so the inside shows for a white link.;
,,,, It should be only be about 6 millimeters (0.23") tall.
,,,,, It's easier to insert the next link if you arrange the previous link with the bend of the fold pointing towards incoming ends.
, You can add on as much as you want.









Use like streamers to decorate a room for a party.
If you add a necklace chain or findings, you can turn this into a necklace.
Make one long enough to go around your waist and dangle a little, for a pretty belt accessory (obviously it cannot carry the weight a normal belt does––it's just decorative).
Use to make hair accessories or jewelry items.
Use as a gift wrapping decoration, in place of ribbon or bows.
Use in craft projects for added decoration.

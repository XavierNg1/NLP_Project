 Add ½ cup (139 g) of canned whole cranberry sauce, ¼ cup (15 g) of chopped fresh cilantro, the zest and juice from a lime, 1 jalapeno that’s been roughly chopped, half a white onion that’s been roughly chopped and microwaved for 1 minute while covered, ¼ cup (45 g) of diced red bell pepper, ¼ cup (45 g) of diced green bell pepper, ½ cup (100 g) of Mexican flavored canned tomatoes that have been drained and chopped, and kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Distribute the ingredients as evenly as you can throughout the bowl.If you don’t have a lime, a lemon will also work.
You can add more or less jalapeno depending on how spicy you want the salsa to be.
 Once all of the ingredients are in the food processor’s bowl, pulse the appliance a few times. You want the mixture to be fully blended but still chunky., When the salsa is completely mixed, pour it into a serving bowl. Serve it with crackers or chips, or as a side dish to pork, chicken, or turkey.The salsa also makes a delicious addition to a turkey sandwich.

 Talk to her and listen to her. Ask her about her family and where she grew up, her religion and politics, and what she likes to do for fun. Don’t be critical or rude about her answers: they are hers, not yours! Respect her ideas, her opinions, and her beliefs. Girls like it when you treat them like people. If you want girls to find you attractive, respecting them as people is a great place to start.


For example, ask her about her favorite hobby, and then ask her how she got in to that hobby. This is a great way to work into talking about where and how she grew up, her family, etc.;
, She likes Metallica….you like Metallica…..bam! You now have something to talk about! Ask her about the music she listens to, the movies she watches, and the things she does in her spare time. Find some common ground and you will have a great way to get to know each other and bond.
 If we guaranteed you wouldn’t get friend-zoned, we’d be lying. But being friends with a girl and showing her what a wonderful person you are is the best way to attract her. Show her how happy she’d be with you and then see how much happier you are with her.


Be supportive when she is having a hard day, help take her mind off of her problems, be available when she needs help, and listen to her when she talks.
 Don’t stare at her and then avoid eye contact. Don’t hover around her and then never actually manage to say anything. Don’t stare at….certain parts of her anatomy (however tempting). Don’t make weird sexual advances if you don’t know her well and definitely don’t use pick up lines. Things like this will freak her out and definitely make you a lot less attractive.

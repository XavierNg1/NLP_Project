 You can mute any phone call using your iPhone 5.
 This will enable the screen, as it is turned off when the iPhone detects that it's being held at your hear to prevent accidental button presses.
 The "Mute" button looks like a microphone with a slash through it. Muting the call will turn off your iPhone's microphone. You'll still be able to hear the other person, but they won't be able to hear you., This will put the call on hold, allowing you to browse your phone or add in another caller.Not all mobile networks support call holding.
 Once you are unmuted, the other person will be able to hear you again.

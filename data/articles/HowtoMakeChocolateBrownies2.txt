 Grease a baking dish with room-temperature butter. Sprinkle a light amount of flour onto the greased pan, covering completely.


Pick a pan that is big enough. Brownies are traditionally flat, meaning that you should pick a bigger pan over a smaller one. Smaller pans will necessitate more time in the oven.
 Alternately, melt the butter in a microwave until just fully melted. Let cool.
 Add the sugar, mixing completely. Add the vanilla extract and eggs, beating until just incorporated.
 Mix the cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder.


Mixing the dry ingredients completely before transferring into the wet ingredients will cut down on the amount of time you mix the batter. The less the batter is mixed, the creamier and fluffier your brownies will turn out.
 Mix until just barely incorporated.
 Spread batter evenly.
 Perform the toothpick test to check for doneness. Leave brownies to cool for at least 10 minutes.
 Dust an even layer across the brownies.

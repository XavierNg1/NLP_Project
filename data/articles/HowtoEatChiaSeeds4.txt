 When preparing any single-serving smoothie or shake, add 1 or 2 tbsp (15â€“30 ml) chia seeds to the blender or food processor with the other ingredients before blending., Stir 2 tsp (10 ml) chia seeds into 10 oz (310 ml) of water, the juice of 1 lemon or lime, and a small amount of raw honey or agave syrup, to taste.
 Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) chia seeds to an 8-oz (250-ml) glass of juice, tea, or any other warm or hot drink. Allow the drink to sit for several minutes so that the seeds can absorb some of the liquid, creating a thicker beverage.

 By leaving the actual sale to professionals, you increase your chances of successfully selling the dress to someone. The downside to using consignment stores, however, is that half of the money you make from selling the dress goes to them.If increasing the odds of selling the dress are more important to you than making money, consignment stores are the way to go.


Wedding dresses come and go out of fashion fairly quickly. To increase your chances even further, try to keep your dress in excellent condition and sell it within 2 1/2 years of when you first bought it. A used gown that is in great condition can expect to make a little more than half of what you originally paid for it.;
, There are many websites like StillWhite.com, NearlyNewlywed.com, and PreOwnedWeddingDresses.com which are resources specifically designed to help you sell your wedding dress online.These sites allow users to either sell their dresses or search for a used dress with certain specifications and finding what dresses most resemble what they are looking for.
 Instead of selling your wedding gown online, you could use local based advertising like Craigslist to sell it around town instead.There may not be anyone in your area who wants to buy your specific wedding gown, though, so this option is not as promising as using online wedding gown sites that will have larger audiences.
 The sheer number of used wedding dresses being sold online and in classified ads makes it difficult to sell your own. Your ad should grab a buyerâ€™s attention, hold their interest, and make them want to buy it.Emphasize the excellent condition of your dress and how much you loved it on your day. If you purchased it from a well known designer, be sure to use their name in your ad.
Be fair when setting your price. No matter how appealing your ad is, no one will buy your dress if the price is too high. Browse the market to see how much similar dresses are selling for and set your price accordingly.

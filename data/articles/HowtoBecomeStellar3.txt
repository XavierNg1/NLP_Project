 Don't let yourself fall into the mindset that if you are the emo subculture you must always be depressed and sad. Stellar is not about turning into a trend zombie; if fashion and subcultures have gone so far that you have to change your personality to fit in, then that's probably not who you want to be.
 If you're shy, then stay that way; there's nothing wrong with being quiet. It's also called introverted. If you don't want to appear antisocial, then just make sure people know you're shy, not angry or silent. If someone starts talking to you, smile and reply to them, but let them know that you don't want to talk very intimately about yourself.
 If you wouldn't normally do something, i.e. rock climbing, then go outside your comfort zone and try it! You'll probably end up better from the experience. Stellar kids aren't known for being afraid to try something new, which is what the fashion is about.

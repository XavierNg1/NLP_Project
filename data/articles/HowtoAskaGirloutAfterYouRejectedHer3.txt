 Before you proceed, make sure you have thought about the past. Why did you turn her down in the first place?How did you respond to her? Were you kind or rude? Does she think of you negatively because of how you responded? If you let her down gently, she may be more open to going out with you. If you were on the harsh side, it will be more difficult.


For example, if she asked you out while you were in the presence of your friends, you looked her up and down, laughed and said "I don't think so," your chances of her accepting a date are pretty slim.
Make a list of the reasons that you did not want to go out with her in the past. Have any of these things changed? Have you changed your perspective on the reasons?

, Do you want to go out with her because you truly like her? Do you want to go out with her just to see if she will say yes?To figure out your true motives, make a list of the pros and cons about the situation.


Your pros and cons should include the things that you like about her and the things that you do not like about her.
If the pros are longer than the cons, you may actually like her. If the cons or longer than the pros, you may just be trying to stroke your ego.
 Whether you let her down easy or not, you probably hurt her feelings. She may have difficulty believing that you really want to go out with or her or she may think that you are playing with her emotions. Be honest with her about the reasons that you turned her down and let her know that you are serious this time around.If you were rude, you may say, “I’m sorry for how I handled things the first time. I thought things over and realized I made a mistake. I would love to take you out.”
Maybe you were uncomfortable with her doing the asking. You may say, “I’m not used to girls asking me out, and it caught me off guard. Please give me another chance and let me take you out.”

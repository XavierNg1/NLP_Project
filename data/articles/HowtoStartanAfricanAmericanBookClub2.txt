 As an African American book club, you have the option of limiting membership to African Americans or opening it to anyone who is interested in studying African American literature. Limiting membership may make everyone feel more comfortable and open about their remarks, but opening membership can ultimately provide a greater number of different perspectives.
 Having a mixed-sex book club can lead to more interesting discussions, but limiting the membership by male or female can make your members feel more comfortable and may make it easier to choose books that appeal to the entire group.


Even if you do not put a limit on the gender, book clubs tend to be predominantly composed of females, so you may find yourself being part of an all-female book club without intending to be.
 A group that is too small will not be very lively, but a group that is too large may make it impossible for everyone who wants to speak to get a chance to do so. Typically, book clubs have between 5 and 15 members. Smaller groups have a more personal feeling to them, but larger groups invite a greater diversity in opinion.
 The more people you talk to about your book club, the greater your odds of spreading the word around your community are.
 Ask your library, church, or local community center if you can post a flyer on their bulletin board. You can also post an ad on a free online classifieds for your city or community. In your advertisements, specify that you are starting an African American book club and provide an email address or phone number for interested parties to contact you at.

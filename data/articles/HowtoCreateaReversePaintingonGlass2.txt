 You will need to paint in sections, allowing different areas time to dry. Drying typically takes 24 hours. For this reason, only mix colors that are needed in a specific area, to avoid having wasted, unused paint on your palette. The first colors to pour are those for line work and small detail. The last colors you will want to do are the background of the image, like the sky.
 You should buy oil paint; 37 ml tubes should be sufficient, unless your glass is very large.If you do not have the exact paint shades that you would like for your painting, begin by mixing paints to get your desired colors.


Squeeze the amount needed (small for a small area, more for a large area) of a light color onto palette paper, wax paper, aluminum foil, or a mixing palette. Add a small dab of the darker primary color to the light color. Mix well with a palette knife or brush. Keep adding small amounts of dark or light until you get the desired shade.
 Once you have the desired color/shade, add gilding size to your paint to help it adhere to the glass. Because glass is non-porous, it does not take paint well. You must use gilding size to help the paint adhere to and dry quicker on the glass.


Pour a small amount of size directly onto your already-mixed paint and begin blending it in. Add size as needed to larger paint piles. The desired ratio is 1/2 paint to 1/2 size. Blend thoroughly with a palette knife or paint brush., Separating the paints will help you avoid accidental color mixing.

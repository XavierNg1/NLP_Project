 The type of pool rack is a very important aspect of the outcome of your break. The tighter the rack, the better the break.;
, Put extra power into the shot by pulling back farther, not by shooting faster. You want a smooth, controlled backswing with full follow-through. A steady, square impact carries more force than a lightning-fast shank.
 Beginners often rest their stick on the back rail. On a regulation table, that puts you too far away. Learn to break from the head-string (the closest point you can be to the rack), with a closed bridge (the hand position that looks like a rotated "OK" sign).
 Go for a full hit in the middle of the cue ball, just below center, so it dies after contact. You want the cue ball to come to rest in the middle of the table so you'll have lots of options for your second shot.
 Some players aim for the second row of balls, hoping to bounce the cue ball off a rail and back into the rack for more action. Whatever. A full hit on the head ball equals a stronger, more consistent break with fewer scratches.
 Watch the cue ball to fine-tune your shot. If it tends to drive forward after impact, hit it lower for more backspin. If it likes to veer off toward the sides, hit it slower for greater accuracy and power.

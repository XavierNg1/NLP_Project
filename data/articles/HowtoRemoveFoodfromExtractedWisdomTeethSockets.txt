 If your surgeon closed the wounds with stitches, food won't be able to get in the holes. You may see particles near the extraction sites that look grey, black, blue, green, or yellow. This is normal discoloration and is part of the healing process., Thoroughly brush and floss the rest of your mouth, but avoid the teeth closest to the wound., It's okay to rinse the first day, but you have to take certain precautions.Combine 1/4 teaspoon salt with one cup of warm water. Stir it well to mix.
Avoid swishing the saltwater rinse in your mouth or spitting it out. Gently move your head to move the rinse around your mouth or use your tongue to help move the saline solution around.
After rinsing, lean over the sink and open your mouth to let the rinse fall out. Don't spit.
Your doctor may also give you chlorhexidine gluconate (Peridex, Periogard) to rinse with. This is a germicidal mouthwash that helps kill bacteria., Don't use your tongue to prod the hole, either. Doing this may introduce bacteria to the wound, and could disrupt the healing tissue.Instead, stick to salt water rinses to remove food particles.
 Any kind of suction activity in the mouth could dislodge blood clots, causing a painful dry socket and potentially leading to infection., Salt water rinses are useful for cleaning wounds in the mouth, removing food, and reducing pain and inflammation.


Mix 1/4 teaspoon salt in eight ounces of water.
Stir completely, so that the salt is well-dissolved in the water.
 You may wish to focus your rinsing action on the affected side of your mouth, to most effectively remove debris and provide inflammation relief., You'll also want to rinse thoroughly before you go to sleep. Doing this will reduce inflammation and help ensure that your wound is kept clean and can heal properly., Using a syringe may help you control the flow of water and allow you to clean your wound more efficiently; however, if not used properly, an irrigator or syringe can dislodge the blood clot forming to heal the tissue. Ask your dentist whether you should use one.Fill the syringe with lukewarm water. You may also use the saltwater solution described above.
Aim the tip of the syringe as close as possible to the site of your wound without actually touching it.
Flush the site of the wound from any necessary angles to thoroughly clean the wound and prevent infection. Do not push too forcefully â€” expelling a powerful jet of water directly into the socket could be harmful.
 Food that gets caught in a wisdom teeth wound may be uncomfortable, but it alone should not cause an infection. Healing can still take place even if food gets caught, and it's more important to avoid touching or probing the wound., Clots in the gums may appear gray and fibrous, like food particles. Cleaning too vigorously in this case may remove the clot and cause further complications., This is especially important during the first 24 hours after surgery. Gradually move from soft foods to semi-soft foods as your wound heals. It's generally best to avoid hard, chewy, crunchy, and spicy foods, as these are most prone to pooling in the socket and causing irritation or infection.Chew on the opposite side or your mouth from the extraction site.
Avoid eating foods that are too hot or cold foods. Go for room temperature foods during the first two days.
 Wash your hands frequently with soap and water. Don't shake hands with people for a week or so. Don't share toothbrushes or other implements with others. You want to make sure that you don't pick up a secondary infection that could tax your immune system.
 Some bleeding will be common over the first few days following a tooth extraction. If you experience any of the following symptoms, however, you should contact your dentist or oral surgeon immediately.Excessive bleeding (more than a slow ooze)
Pus in the wound
Difficulty swallowing/breathing
Fever
Swelling that increases after two or three days
Blood or pus in nasal mucus
Throbbing, dull pain after the first 48 hours
Bad breath after three days
Pain that is not reduced after taking painkillers

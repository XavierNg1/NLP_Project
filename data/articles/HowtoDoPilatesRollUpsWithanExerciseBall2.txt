 Your head and torso should come off the floor as you perform this movement, but make sure not to hunch your shoulders.
 Your legs should still be stretched out and your toes should still be pointed, but everything from the hips up should be perpendicular to the floor.
 You should do this as deliberately as you can, rolling your back down to the ground slowly and extending your arms behind you again as you do so. Once you've gotten back to the starting position, begin to repeat the motion for the specified number of reps.

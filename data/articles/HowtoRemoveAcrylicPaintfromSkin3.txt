 If the paint has already dried on the skin, you will need additional measures to remove the stain. Start by washing the area with soap and warm water. Loosen the paint as much as possible to weaken its hold on the skin. Scrub the area lightly as you wash.


Pat the area with a towel before proceeding to treat the spot so that the water on your skin doesn’t dilute the alcohol.
 Take a washcloth or large cotton ball swab. Douse the cloth or cotton ball with roughly an ounce of standard rubbing alcohol. Alcohol is a solvent for acrylic paint, which means it will start to break down the paint once it’s applied to the skin.For ease of application, press the cloth or cotton swab to the mouth of the alcohol bottle and turn it upside down, soaking a compact circle perfect for scrubbing.
Pure rubbing alcohol is one of the most highly recommended methods for removing paint from various surfaces., Dab the area with the washcloth or cotton ball to wet it and give the alcohol time to begin acting on the paint. Then, go over the paint spot with alcohol using small, circular strokes to coax the paint out of the crevices of the skin’s surface. Scrub the area until all paint is gone, reapplying alcohol as needed.You may have to scrub quite forcefully to reach paint that has settled deep into the skin.
 Once all traces of paint have been removed, wash and dry the area to clear it of any leftover rubbing alcohol. Isopropyl alcohol is a mild irritant to the skin, and can cause redness and irritation if it is not rinsed away.

 If the tick is fastened to a person or a pet, detach it first. Grasp the tick's head with a pair of tweezers with pointy tips. Pull slowly upward, in a straight motion.Tweezers with wide tips may crush the tick or squeeze out infectious germs.
Never use your bare hands. If you must touch the tick, wear disposable gloves.;
, Cover the tick with transparent tape on all sides. The tick will die on its own, and cannot get free.This is the best method to use, since the tick will be mostly undamaged.This makes it easy for a doctor to identify the tick, if you end up showing symptoms.


You can use a sealed, clear container instead, such as a small zip-locked bag. Check for holes and make sure it is fully sealed.
 If you do not have tape, drop the tick into a container full of alcohol.It may take a while for the tick to die. Watch it or cover with a transparent lid to make sure it does not escape.


Water will not kill the tick. If you don't have rubbing alcohol, try bleach or vinegar.
 Scrub with rubbing alcohol or an iodine scrub, if you have it. Use soapy water if not.This reduces the chance of an infection spreading.
 Tape the dead or trapped tick over an index card. On the card, write the date you found the tick, and locations it might have come from. Store it away from pets and children.
 Some ticks can spread diseases, especially deer ticks. Bring the victim and the tick to a doctor if the victim develops these symptoms within three months:Fever or chills
Headaches, muscle aches, or joint pain
A rash, especially a large red "bulls eye" rash.

Swollen lymph nodes, usually in the armpit or groin

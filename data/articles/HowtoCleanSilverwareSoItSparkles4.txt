 Rubbing alcohol is excellent for removing mineral spots and residue from your silverware. It may not be very effective for cleaning silverware that is heavily tarnished, however.For severe tarnishing, try one of the baking soda methods instead.
You may want to use this method after one of the other methods if you find that your silverware still has some mineral deposits.
 Combine one part rubbing alcohol and four parts water in a bowl. You will not be placing the silverware in the bowl, so it doesn't matter how large it is.To avoid wasting water and rubbing alcohol, start with a very small amount. You should not need to use a lot of solution to clean your silverware.
 Dip a clean, soft cloth into the mixture of water and rubbing alcohol. Then use the dampened cloth to lightly buff your silverware until it is clean and sparkling.You should not have to apply much pressure, as you will only be removing surface deposits with the rubbing alcohol.

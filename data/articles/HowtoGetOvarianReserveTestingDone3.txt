 Antral follicles are tiny structures that contain immature eggs. A transvaginal ultrasound can be performed to visually assess your antral follicle count (AFC). Determining this count can provide an estimate of the number of remaining eggs present in each of your ovaries.This test is considered more accurate than FSH testing for older women (greater than 44 years old).
Your FSH levels can vary from month to month, while your AFC will remain relatively stable.
 A transvaginal ultrasonic test can also be used to measure your ovarian volume. The size (volume) of your ovaries can also help indicate the number of remaining eggs in your reserve. By measuring your ovaries on three planes and using some calculation, your doctor should be able to determine your ovarian volume.This test alone is not the most accurate indicator of ovarian reserve or fertility.
This information can be useful, however, when placed in conjunction with other results.
 For some women, a combination of biochemical and imaging (ultrasound) techniques can provide the most accurate assessment of their ovarian reserve. Since no single fertility test can boast 100% accuracy, multiple methods are often combined.Discuss this carefully with your healthcare provider, and select the best 1-2 tests for you.
The combination of too many tests can actually cloud results and lead to confusion.

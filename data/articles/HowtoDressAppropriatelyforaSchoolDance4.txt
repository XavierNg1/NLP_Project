 If the dance calls for formal attire, rent or buy a suit and wear a button-down shirt and tie underneath. You can opt for an optional vest or cumberbund under the suit, too. Or go without a jacket altogether and stick with nice dress pants and a button-down for more semi-formal dances.


If you’re going with a date, coordinate with them first to see if part of their outfit can match yours. If your date is a girl, their dress, top, or accessories could match your shirt, tie, or vest/cumberbund.
 Get dress shoes made of leather or similar material. Match them with the color of belt that you’re wearing.
 Wear a nice leather belt, and choose a watch and a piece of jewelry if you like, such as a ring or a simple necklace. Get cufflinks to fasten the sleeves of your button-down shirt.You can wear a top hat or other dressy hat if you want, but anything like a cap or beanie isn’t acceptable for a formal dance.


For a prom or other very formal dance, you can follow the tradition of wearing a boutonniere that complements your outfit and a girl’s corsage. You can tell your date what color to buy you, or you can just buy or make your own! Wear your boutonniere pinned to the lapel of your suit.

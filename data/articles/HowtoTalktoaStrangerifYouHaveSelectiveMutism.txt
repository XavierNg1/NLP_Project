 Remember to be safe, and maybe a bit far away from them and call out. If you're at the mall however, and there are many people around, try to find maybe a woman with a stroller, as they're already a tad pre-occupied with their children, and are usually very safe especially in the mall environmentÂ  (to avoid being impolite, don't talk to someone that's on the phone or doing something else.);
, Easy so far, right? You can tap them lightly on the shoulder if you're afraid they won't hear you. Just don't sneak up on them and give them a heart attack!

, It helps if you think of something beforehand, so you don't stand there wondering what to say. After selecting this, say or call it to the stranger. Don't say anything rude or inconsiderate. You can compliment them, which is always an easy and safe road to take. Ex: I like your shoes. Or simply say, hi. Maybe mention the weather, or make small talk if your SM is not severe. You can also ask them a question, but this also takes more effort, as you have to wait for an answer and maybe say something else if they ask you something in return, so start out with statements instead, and work your way up. Then, you run away as fast you can if you want! Don't worry about making a fool of yourself, like a lot of people with SM do, because guess what, it's very unlikely that you'll see this stranger again, unless you live in a small town.
 It always helps to get feedback on your experience. If no one that you talk to is around, (or your SM is so severe that you don't talk to anyone in your household) keep in mind that other sufferers of the silence of SM are going through the same thing that you are. Congrats, and I'm sure you'll beat this pesky disorder soon enough!

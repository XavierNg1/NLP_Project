 Flirting with a guy you like by dressing up, using a sweet-smelling perfume, showing him that you've got a big social life, and so on can help him see that you're interested - and interesting. There's no harm in playing a little hard to get, as long as you don't get too consumed by trying to attract his attention.
 Making him miss you might turn his head initially, but eventually he'll get bored if you wait forever to answer his texts or avoid him for too long between dates. He might also catch on to your plot to make him miss you if you spend too much time bragging about the fun you have without him. Instead of figuring out new ways to make him miss you, try telling him how you really feel.
 It's normal to want your ex to miss you when you're gone, especially if you were the one who got dumped. However, focusing too much on making him miss you will probably end up backfiring. You'll get too obsessed by what he thinks, when instead you should be moving on. Give yourself, and him, a break and don't try to manipulate him after you've already broken up.

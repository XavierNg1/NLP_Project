 You get rares by collecting on Rare Item Mondays. Look out in the Daily Explorer for Rare Item Monday updates. Playing adventures in Hard Mode will also get you rares, however, you will not get a rare every time you play. You can also get rares in the Forgotten Desert, but not every time. You should have at least 10 to 15 rares to start off.;
, Try trading or getting people to trade small den or clothing betas for your rares. Small tables, Cami Frogs, Rocking Horses and Jamaaliday Bows can get you started on for the next step.
 They are all good betas. Try getting one of those below is a good way to get even rarer:


Wallpaper
Flooring
Archways
Mech Angel Helmets
Beta Elf Tail Armors
Glitched Nerd Glasses.
 Start off with short wristbands, then trying to go for long wrists, then short collars.
 Trade for spikes for a glitched item is fair enough. Glitched items are very rare and most people will want them for their headdress. To trade for a glitched item, start finding some person who is willing to trade their glitched item. You should start trading them, then ask what to change or add. They will think you will be changing good enough for their item. They will probably accept before you know it. But don't try to anger them. They might leave, and decline your offer.
 If you get a rare Headdress, it's extremely hard to get a non rare one. If you get a Headdress using the same method by telling the person to add or not, you're lucky! Never give up.

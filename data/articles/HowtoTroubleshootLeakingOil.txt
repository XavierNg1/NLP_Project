 Take out the dipstick, which will be red, orange, or yellow. You should not need to remove the oil cap itself to check the dipstick. Wipe off any oil with a rag or paper towel so you can see the mark that indicates the proper oil level. "Dip" the stick into the oil reservoir and then take it back out. Look to see if the oil on the stick reaches the oil level mark.


It is ideal to check your oil once a week.
Add oil if the crankcase is low or empty. Continue checking every 30 minutes. Rapidly leaking oil could mean there is a hole in your oil pan.;
, The combination of an ultraviolet (UV) or blue light and fluorescent dyes allows you to find small oil leaks. Add the dye to your oil reservoir and let your engine idle for 10 minutes. With the overhead lights off, shine the fluorescent light over your engine. Glowing areas indicate leaks.
 Wrap packing cellophane around the connectors, sensors and wiring harnesses and secure with duct tape. Spray degreaser on your engine, chassis and suspension and let sit for the time specified in the instructions. Using a steam cleaner, eliminate any grease or hardened dirt. Dry electrical components and sensors with compressed air.
 Drive your car for about 15 minutes. If there is oil on the surface, it will appear in the powder, allowing you to see its point of origin.
 Multiple oil leaks can be present due to natural wear of the seals used to retain the oil. It is not uncommon for valve cover gaskets, cam seals, and oil pan gaskets leak at the same time. All the rubber seals that retain fluid on an engine are exposed to the same heating and cooling of the engine, and may fail one at a time or all together.

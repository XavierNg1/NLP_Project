 Stir the sugar and water together in a small saucepan. Set it over medium-high heat.


Start with cold water for best results.
Make sure that the saucepan has tall sides to prevent the syrup from bubbling over.
 Let the mixture reach a boil. After it boils, let it boil steadily for up to 1 minute.


Boil the mixture over medium-high heat, stirring frequently to help dissolve the sugar.
Make sure that the sugar has dissolved before you remove the syrup from the heat. If you can still see sugar crystals in the syrup, it needs to boil for a longer amount of time.
 Remove the syrup base from the heat and let it cool to room temperature.


Let it sit out at room temperature as it cools. Do not transfer it to the refrigerator yet.
 Once the syrup has cooled to room temperature, stir in the package of unsweetened fruit-flavored soft drink mix until fully blended.


You can use any flavor you desire. Since the powder is designed to dissolve in drinks, you should have little to no problem getting it to dissolve in the syrup.
 Stir 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of flavored syrup into 8 oz (250 ml) cold milk. Add more or less as desired.


Any remaining syrup can be saved in a sealed jar and refrigerated for roughly one month.

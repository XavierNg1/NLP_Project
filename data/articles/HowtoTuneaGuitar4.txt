 In standard guitar tuning, the strings are tuned EADGBE. Each letter corresponds to a string, from the low sixth to the high first. It’s easy to remember this order with a fun acronym, like:Every Angry Dog Gets Bit Eventually

, Follow each string to its corresponding tuning peg. In most cases, turning the pegs counterclockwise will raise the pitch of the string. Do this if it is lower than the desired note (flat). Turn a peg clockwise to lower a string if the pitch is too high (sharp).You only need to turn the tuning pegs a little at a time. This will make it easier to find the precise pitches you need.
 Once you’ve tuned your guitar by any method, play some notes and chords to make sure everything sounds right. Sometimes notes are off because the guitar moved slightly as pressure changed from adjusting strings, or simply because a tuner or your ear wasn’t 100% accurate. If this is the case, just check the strings again and readjust any that are off., Tuning a guitar to itself is just fine for solo play and practice. Though the notes relative to each other will sound in tune, it means the whole guitar might be a little sharp or flat relative to other instruments. To be in tune with other people, you’ll want to be in “concert pitch,” or tuned to the precise notes EADGBE.Use a digital tuner, tuning forks, or a slide whistle to find the precise pitches you need.

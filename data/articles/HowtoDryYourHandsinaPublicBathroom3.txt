 Paper towel dispensers can be stacked, on rolls, or in sheets. Use both hands to pull paper towels off. Rip the towels off gently or you will end up with half of a paper towel.


Some dispensers work by simply pulling out the towels. Grasping the towel by the edge, gently pull the towel free from the dispenser.
Roller dispensers will have towels that are perforated for separation. Hold both sides of the towel and pull straight down on the towel edge. A single sheet of towel will release automatically.
Some roller dispensers have levers for dispensing the towels. Pressing on the lever will cause a sheet of paper towel to drop. Use both hands to separate it from the roll.
Use your elbow to press the dispensing lever. This way, your freshly sanitized hands won’t pick up any germs that could be on the lever., Placing your hands on opposite sides, rub the cloth briskly across your hands. There are different ways to do this. You can move them in the same direction, or you can move one hand up and the other hand down.
 Don’t overdo it. People generally take more towels than they need. If you shake excess water from your hands before using the paper towel, you can limit the number needed to get your hands dry.If you are concerned about environmental waste, you may want to avoid using paper towels when possible.
 Don’t be too quick. To get the excess water off your hands, you should allow the paper to rest on your hands for a few seconds. Be sure to dry your fingers and around finger nails.
 Look at your hands, are they still wet? If they are, you should keep drying them. After you're done, dispose the used towel in trash receptacles.

 Open up Windows Explorer by pressing âŠž Win+E. This will display all of the drives that are connected to your computer.
 Select Properties from the menu.
 You will see a couple of different options. Find the "Error checking" section.
 You may have to enter an administrator password if you are not currently logged in as the administrator.
 Depending on the version of Windows you are running, you may need to enable error correction. Later versions of Windows will handle all of this automatically.
 The scan will begin. Scanning the hard drive can take a significant amount of time, and may slow down your computer as you are using it. Try to run the scan at a time when you are not using your computer.


If any errors are detected, Windows will attempt to fix them automatically. You will receive a report at the end of the scan letting you know what the results were.

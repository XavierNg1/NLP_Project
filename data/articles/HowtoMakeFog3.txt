 Use 4 to 8 gallons (15.1 to 30.3 L) of hot water to maintain the fog in 15-minute bursts.Try to maintain a temperature between 120 and 180 degrees Fahrenheit (49 and 82 degrees Celsius). Additionally, boiling water is not ideal because it adds its own vapor to the dry ice fog, causing it to flow up instead of sprawling down and outward.
Keep your container of water hot using a hot plate to maintain your fog for a long time.
 Dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide, which has a much lower freezing point than water (-109.3°F or -78.5°C.) Drop the dry ice into the hot water using tongs. Typically, 1 lb (450 ml) will produce enough fog to last for 2 to 3 minutes.Hotter water will create more fog, but the hotter the water is, the faster the ice will turn to fog and the more often you will need to add more.
Always handle dry ice with insulated gloves and tongs.
 The extremely cold temperature of dry ice will have an immediate reaction to the hot water, causing a thick cloud of fog to form. The rising steam of the hot water, together with the melting ice, creates the effect of fog.Control the direction of the fog with a small electric fan.
Because fog will naturally be heavier than air, most of the fog will sink to the floor or ground unless you force it to rise with the fan.
 Every 15 minutes or so, you'll need to add more dry ice to consistently maintain the fog effect. Smaller pieces of dry ice added to the water will maintain greater fog volume over time, rather than larger pieces that will great large bursts of fog.Try using a hot plate to keep your water from cooling off, or refresh with hot water from your kitchen.
Be aware that water is likely to bubble out from the reaction of the dry ice and water. If you're making fog indoors, know that the floor is likely to become slippery wherever the fog is.

 This translates directly to "I don't know ". Pronounce it as "juh-nuh-say-pah" or "shu-nu-say-pah". To pronounce the "je" like "shu", shape your mouth like you are beginning to "shush" someone, but carry on the "sh" sound by following with a sound almost halfway between "uh" and "ooo". This should sound something like "eu". The "ne" is similar: just replace the "sh" with a "n" sound.


Note: in modern spoken French, the "je" and "ne" ("I" and "don't") often glide together, so you may sound more authentic if you slur your syllables—as in, "jeun-say-pah," or even "shay-pah".If you want to be especially polite, say, "I don't know, sorry." In French, that's "Je ne sais pas, deslolée." Pronounce "desolée" as "dez-oh-lay".
Bear in mind that the negating "ne" is always used in written French, but is often dropped in informal spoken French. One might say to a friend, for instance, "Je sais pas," and mean something like "I dunno.";
, "Je," ne," "sais," and "pas":


"Je" is the first person subject, or "I".
"Sais" is the first person conjugation of "savoir", a verb which translates as "to know something". Always put the "ne" before the verbal tense and the "pas" after it.
"Pas" loosely translates as "not".
"Ne" doesn't really mean anything, and is more a formality of grammar that accompanies "pas". This is why a person speaking informally can omit the "ne" and simply say "Je sais pas."

, Add the specific thing that you don't know to the end of the phrase—this can be a piece of information, or it can be a certain thing with which you are not familiar. Review the following examples:


"Je ne sais pas parler français" means "I don't know how to speak French."
"Je ne sais pas la réponse" means "I don't know the answer."
"Je ne sais pas nager" means "I don't know how to swim."
"Je ne sais quoi faire" means "I don't know what to do." The "pas" is unnecessary in this example because the verb savoir is being used with a question word.

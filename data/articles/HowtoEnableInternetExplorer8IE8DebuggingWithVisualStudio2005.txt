Note:
If you are using a 64-bit computer, you want to edit the 32-bit registry. This will restrict IE8 to one process per instance and protection mode will automatically turn off, if you are running Windows Vista / Windows 7 or newer.
 So you will need to re-enable it:


Open Internet Explorer.
Go to Tools->Internet Options.
Switch to the Advanced tab.
Uncheck Disable script debugging (internet explorer).

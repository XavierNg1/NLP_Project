 Is this person of significance to you? Are they a friend, family member, colleague, employer, clergy member, or professor? Do they hold some type of authority over you? Decide if you think this person is in the right position to offer you criticism. If you don’t believe that they are, remain calm, thank them for their opinion, and walk away.If the other person does hold a position of authority over you, you might be put in a position of having to agree, or at least not disagree with them.
 You might have a person in your life that belittles you or regularly criticizes you. They aren’t offering constructive feedback, but are trying to chip away at your self esteem. This person is toxic to you and probably isn’t telling you anything worthwhile. Set boundaries and decide on your response if those boundaries are crossed.Whether this person is a friend, family member, or colleague, you have the right to choose who is in your life. If someone is criticizing you baselessly, you might consider that they aren’t a healthy influence for you.
 Try to imagine the other person’s perspective and get a feel for why they might perceive your actions or behavior as they have. Do they work in a different part of the company, only interacting with you on the phone? Or perhaps they always drive the vehicle immediately after you and always see it dirty. You still might not agree with what they have to say, but trying to imagine the situation from their point of view is helpful and may clear up misunderstandings.

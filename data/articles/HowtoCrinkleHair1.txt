 One way to help give your hair stylish crinkles is to prime your hair with texturizing spray. This helps give your hair enough grip that the crinkles will hold. Cover your hair with texturizing spray when wet, and then blow it dry.Hold the spray bottle around six inches away from your hair. Spray a light mist of spray over all of your hair, then comb through the strands to spread it.;
, You can have loose or tight crinkles depending on the tool that you use. For loose crinkle waves, use a heat waver iron. You can also use a wider crimp tool for loose crinkles.Use a small crimping iron for tight crinkles. This will give you tiny crinkles spread out through your hair. You can achieve this look with a crimping iron with small, narrow plates., This makes it easier to use the waver or crimping iron. Divide your hair in half, and then section and style off one half before the other. Place your hair into small sections that are around one inch (25 mm) each., Use the heat tool on the bottom, back sections first. This helps you get the harder to reach parts styled before you let more hair down., Move the waver or crimping iron down along your section of hair instead of up from the bottom. Hold the waver closed for a few seconds, long enough that the hair should be crinkled when released and it will be hot to the touch.You can go all the way to the tips or leave the ends free for a bit of a casual, beach-vibe.
 After you finish putting the waves over your entire hair, run your hands through it. This helps get rid of the “just crinkled” look and give your hair a more natural, casual look.

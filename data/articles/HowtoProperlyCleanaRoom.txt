, When picking up clothes, it would be better to put them in a drawer or in a dirty clothes hamper. Do not throw them under a bed or couch or in a closet; parents always notice when you do this.
 Dusting will not always seem like it is doing a lot when in the act, but it always makes our room look better and sometimes adds a shine. You should wait a few minutes for the air born dust to settle on the floor before vacuuming.
 Put the books back in, but not in any sloppy order, put them in alphabetical order (title or author it is up you, try to make it the easiest system for you to use).
 There are usually lots of dust bunnies under beds and couches and in corners! If you have a rug on your floor, you can vacuum it then roll it up and vacuum the floor underneath. Vacuuming will make your room feel better, smell better, and taste better. Your room should already look a lot better.
 This includes: making the bed, putting items back where they are supposed to go, and possibly moving furniture around for a different look. After organizing everything you should be in top shape and looking good all over!

 To change when the background music begins and ends, click and drag in the clip to the right or to the left within the Audio editing timeline. To have the audio clip begin right away, drag the audio clip all the way to the left, at the beginning of the editing timeline.


Put a 5-second delay on the background music, for example, by clicking and dragging the clip to the right so that the outer-most edge on the left lines up with the 5-second mark on the timeline ruler. If you cannot clearly see where the 5-second mark is on the timeline, you may need to zoom in closer by clicking the Zoom button, which resembles a plus sign and is located on top of the timeline. The background music clip has been moved into position.

 Your kit should include food and water for a couple days, a radio, batteries, first aid supplies, and a flashlight. Your kit will not only provide you with items you may need during and after a tsunami event, but it will give you piece of mind while you are evacuating., Perhaps the most important part of preparing for a tsunami is creating evacuation routes to high points inland. By plotting several different evacuation routes, you’ll limit the amount of time you may have to waste figuring out where to go during a tsunami. Create plans that will take you from:

Work to a safe zone.
Home to a safe zone.
Likely places you may be in your community to a safe zone., Take the time to drive or walk the route several times in advance. Look for alternative ways to cross rivers, streets, or get around major buildings.

By familiarizing yourself with your evacuation route, you’ll be much more likely to be able to avoid dangers like downed power lines or damaged bridges., A contact plan will let you know how and when to communicate with friends or family after you have evacuated. You should also include a place to meet friends and family after authorities have signaled an all clear.Choose a location that is easily accessible and in a safety zone. Possible locations include a friend’s house, a public park, or a landmark.
Make sure you include a timeline for communication in your plan. For example, have a first contact time (maybe 1 to 3 hours after the event), a second contact point (6 to 12 hours after), and a third contact point (a day after the event).

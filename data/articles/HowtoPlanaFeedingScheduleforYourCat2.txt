 If you are consistent, it generally doesn’t matter what time of day you feed your cat. If your mornings are hectic trying to get ready for work and get the kids ready for school, it may be better to feed your cat in the afternoon or evening. If you’re feeding your cat two or three times a day, pick the times that are easiest for you and do your best to stick to this schedule.It might help you remember to feed your cat at the same time every day if you stick to a ritual. For example, put food out when you are waiting for your coffee to brew every morning, or feed your cat as soon as you get home from work in the evening.
 Remember, your cat will get used to the schedule you choose and may “remind” you when it’s meal time. For example, if you feed your cat around 7a.m. every Monday through Friday morning, don’t be surprised if your cat wakes you up on the weekends at this time as well. Your cat will become accustomed to the feeding schedule you set and will expect to be fed promptly.
 Each cat is different, so your cat might prefer to be fed at a different time than your friend’s cat. For example, if you notice your cat doesn’t eat its morning meal, but seems to beg for more food before bedtime, try switching up your cat’s feeding schedule to accommodate its preferences.


However, if your cat’s preferences make it difficult for you to maintain a consistent feeding schedule, it might be better to stick to the schedule that works best for you.

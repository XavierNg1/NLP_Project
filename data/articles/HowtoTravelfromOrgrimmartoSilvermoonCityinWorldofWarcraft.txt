 You can find the Zeppelin tower to the east of the Orgrimmar main gate, between The Valley of Strength and The Drag. Look for the Zeppelin that will take you to Tirisfal Glades (Undercity), which can be found on the south side of the tower.;
, The Zeppelin arrives every few minutes. Hop on board when it shows up, and then wait to arrive at Tirisfal Glades.


If you accidentally take the wrong Zeppelin and end up in Stranglethorn, take the other Zeppelin that docks at the same tower that you arrived at and you will be taken to Tirisfal Glades.
 If you look to the south from the Zeppelin tower, you'll see the gates to Undercity.
 The gates to Undercity are directly south of the Zeppelin tower, just a few paces away. Head through the gates to enter Undercity.
 This is the first area you enter when you pass through the Undercity gates. You'll see a gazebo in the center of the courtyard. Head south towards the gazebo structure and then look to your right.


Don't go deeper into Undercity, as it's easy to get lost in the complex elevator system. The Orb of Translocation is found at the northern edge of the city, in the Ruins of Lordaeron.
 The Ruins of Lordaeron is a large courtyard area at the entrance of Undercity. Take an immediate right from the central gazebo in the Ruins and walk up the staircase.
 Enter the chamber at the top of the staircase. You'll see the Orb of Translocation at the center of the room.


The map coordinates of the Orb are 59,67 if you are having difficulty finding it.
You'll need Burning Crusade installed in order to use the Orb of Translocation., You will end up in the Inner Sanctum of the Sunfury Spire in Silvermoon City. If you need to get back to Orgrimmar, you can follow the steps in reverse.

 Professors will often have the option to add students past capacity so long as there are enough chairs. This typically needs to be done before a certain date, so be sure to plan what classes you'd like to take well ahead of time.;
, If you have a special interest in the class, need it as a prerequisite, or need it to graduate, professors may be sympathetic.
 If the professor comes early too, this will give you a chance to introduce yourself. The professor may also be able to tell you your chances of getting in. If the professor won't be able to add you, this saves you time and gives you a chance to crash or attend other classes.
 If the professor asks a question or asks for volunteers, don't hesitate to make yourself known.
 Shake hands and introduce yourself, and be sure to reiterate your interest in the class and your reasons for taking it. Ask if it would be okay to attend a few class meetings to see if a spot opens up.
, Some professors may even offer to grade your homework and exams. You may be able to list the class on your transcript or test out of it in the future.
 If the issue is simply having enough units, be adventurous and look at courses you wouldn't normally take, such as dance, psychology, philosophy, or communications.

 First, arrange two cards into a slightly-off-center "T". Hold the cards, one in each hand, so that their flat faces are perpendicular to the table. Lean them against each other to form another almost-T. Next, place a third card against the middle of one card to form another "T". Close the box with a fourth card and "T", so you have four cards pressed against each other with a square space in the center.


This is the basic four-card cell or "lock box". It is one of the most structurally stable foundations that you can lay for your house of cards. Think of this cell as a pattern that you can repeat throughout your design.
 Overlap two cards flat on top of your four-card cell. Then, lay two more flat cards (rotated at a 90-degree angle) to complete the roof. A "double-ply" flat layer will make your eventual structure much more stable.
 Carefully construct a second four-card cell on top off the flat layer. You now have a stable two-story card structure. Feel free to keep adding stories until you run out of cards, or until you think the structure is tall enough. The four-card cell is a very strong root, so you should be able to stack many levels atop the foundation.


Try adding "wings" to the house by attaching more T-shapes to the ground floor. Whenever you put down a card shape that is perpendicular to the table surface, make sure to lay a flat card layer on top as a "ceiling". This will make the cards more structurally sound, and it will make the whole building look more like a house.
Get creative. The sky's the limit with this method â€“ so see how big of a house you can build!

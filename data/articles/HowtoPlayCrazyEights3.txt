 Don’t be afraid to add on to the basic rules with your own rules.
 In the basic way to play, a player can draw a card from the stock even if he/she has a card in his/her hand that he/she can play.Make a rule that says if you have a card you can play in your hand, you must play it.
Make a rule that says if you draw a card from the stock that is a legal card, you can play it immediately instead of waiting for your next turn.
Make a rule that says you can only draw a certain number of cards from the stock during each turn. If you still cannot (or will not) play a card that you have drawn, the turn passes to the next player.
 Make a rule that says if a player has only one card left, he/she must alert the other players of that fact. If a player fails to do so, he/she must draw two cards., This makes the game more like UNO. Designate a number or face card to be a ‘skip next player’ card, a ‘reverse order’ card and a ‘draw two’ card.Example: Designate 4s to be a skip card. If you play any 2, the next player’s turn gets skipped. Designate all Queens to be reverse cards. If you play a queen, the order of play is reversed. Designate Kings to be draw-two cards. If you play a king, the next player must draw two cards.

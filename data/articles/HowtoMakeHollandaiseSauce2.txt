 Add the salt and freshly ground pepper.
 The bain marie should already contain hot water but not boiling at any time.
 Do not let it get hot, just melt gently.
 You can use the whites for something else. Beat the egg yolks to combine, then add 1 tablespoon of water. Transfer the egg yolks to the saucepan with warmed water and seasonings.
 Continue to whisk until the egg yolks take on the consistency of thickened cream.
 Add 2 tablespoons of water gradually in drops, once the butter has been completely added.
 Adjust the seasoning as needed. Once happy with the flavor, add the lemon juice and stir through quickly.
 If needed, the sauce can be strained. Serve warm.

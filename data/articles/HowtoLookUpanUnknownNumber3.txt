 You should never answer a call you do not recognize as it could be a scam call. This is especially true if the same number keeps calling you without leaving a message. If someone really needed to get ahold of you, they would leave a message with information on how to contact them., Phone apps can help you identify unknown calls, but sometimes have questionable privacy policies. Some phone apps will upload your contact list to their database and may or may not keep you and your contacts' information private. Before downloading a phone app, read the privacy policy carefully.If an app's privacy policy is very difficult to understand, it may be intentionally poorly worded due to throw off users. If you can't understand an app's privacy policy, do not download it.
 If you're repetitively getting scam calls report them to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Scam calls are often marked by very pushy telemarketers asking for personal information, especially financial information, but refusing to answer questions regarding themselves and their company. You can report potential scam calls to 1-888-382-1222.The FTC regulates scam calls in the United States only. If you're outside the United States, find the equivalent organization in your country to report the call.

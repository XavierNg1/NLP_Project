 Buy a makeup palette from a costume shop or party supply store. Many different manufacturers of theatrical makeup make palettes especially designed for creating fake bruises. You may also buy separate compacts instead if you'd like. You will also need a makeup sponge for each color to keep from ruining the palette.


Bruises will generally require the following colors: dark maroon, blood red, dark blue, purple, pale green, and yellow.
This method will give you the most realistic-looking results.
 For healing bruises, this will be yellow or pale green. For all other bruises, use bright blood red. Avoid making solid lines or obvious shapes that would look strange on a real bruise., Cover most of the underlayer first in maroon. Then, sponge on a layer of purple over most of the maroon. Use the makeup sponge to blend well at the edges of each layer. For healing bruises, skip maroon and use purple only. Sponge the purple around the perimeter of the bruise and leave a spot of underlayer visible in the center.
For fresh bruises, leave most of the red underlayer visible and add just a bit of maroon for shadows. Skip adding other colors.
 Small splashes or patches of other colors from your bruise palette can add variety. Make sure to blend all layers well with a sponge to avoid looking fake or cheesy. Once you've finished completely, set your bruise with powder.

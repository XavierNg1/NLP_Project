 Bottling up your emotions is not good for you, and you will feel sad forever. Forget all that nonsense that you're not supposed to mourn an animal as much as you would a person. There was a bond that you cherished, and no matter the nature of the bond, it is missed.
 You might send out a mass e-mail, but not to everyone in your address book. Send it to those who know you well, and care about you. You will receive many responses that let you know others loved and appreciated your pet and will validate your feelings.
 Don't pretend you never had one. Even though it makes you sad, it is best to remember and cherish the memories, not ignore them. It may hurt at first, but it's the only path to closure, and it's the only way you'll ever be able to remember fondly your time with your pet. This is a good time to make a scrapbook or post photos on your blog or homepage. Include pictures, stories, and notes about your pet. Read "The Rainbow Bridge" poem online. It will make you feel better about your loss.
 Although losing a pet is very sad, it is no reason to shut yourself up in your house or go into depression. Your pet has always felt comfort in your comfort, and the sooner you get back on track, the sooner you'll be yourself again.
 While emotionally, you may not be prepared to welcome another pet into your home right away, the act of helping to care for a homeless pet, a pet in desperate need of a caring human, may help with your grieving and sadness.
 Plant a tree, donate to a shelter or college of veterinary medicine.

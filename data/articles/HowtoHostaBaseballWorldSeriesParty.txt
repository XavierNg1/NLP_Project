 When you're inviting people over, make sure you choose what game you want to watch, preferably game 5,6, or 7. Or any game that you think will be the "final game" of the series.;
, A sports party is NOTHING without snacks!! Some popular baseball foods fall into Potato Chips, with or without dip or salsa, Chex Mix is always good, Ritz crackers w/cheese dip. Anything Salty, Crunchy or cheesy would be good.
 You will need Soda or juice for the kids, and various kinds of beer/soda/other alcohol/ for the adults. If you buy many packs of drinks and food, many stores will give you a discount for all the stuff you're buying.
 Also, lay out LOTS of team gear on the walls.
 Do you want people coming into your home to see soda cans on the floor, or piles of laundry? Of course not! Run the vacuum, CLEAN THE TV SCREEN! Put a tablecloth to avoid food messes.
 The world series is always on FOX. And for each game they have long pregame shows. That will also give your invitees to fill up on food before the big game!

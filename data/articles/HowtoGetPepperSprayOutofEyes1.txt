 Pepper spray is an oil-based substance which causes severe irritation to your eyes and skin. If you get pepper spray in your eyes, resist the temptation to touch your face or rub your eyes. Touching your face will just spread the oil around and increase the affected area.Don't touch your face, but do tear up your eyes by blinking a lot.
Blinking produces liquid that helps start the process of flushing the spray residue from your eyes.;
, If you are wearing contact lenses when you get pepper spray in your eyes, take these out immediately. The spray residues will stick to the lenses and continue to irritate your eyes. Throw the lenses away. Even cleaning them will not remove the residue.After taking out your lenses, submerge your face in cool, clean water.
Open and close your eyes underwater several times.
 Even if you manage to flush out your eyes, the symptoms may persist. Irritation to the eyes can continue anywhere from 30 minutes to over two hours. Inflammation of the throat lining can also cause breathing difficulties for up to an hour.


If your symptoms are particularly severe or last longer than this, you should go to a hospital or walk-in centre.
If you have asthma, pepper spray can cause serious breathing difficulties and you should get emergency medical treatment.

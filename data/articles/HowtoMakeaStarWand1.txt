 The paper needs to be strong enough to withstand decorating and sitting atop the wand. Construction paper, cereal box card or thin card are the best types of paper.;
, The star should be a substantial size; a good ratio is to make a star the size of a child's hand for a child's wand and a star the size of an adult's hand for an adult's wand.
 Place it over the paper you're making the star from. Cut out two stars from the paper.
 For a stick, use something long and slim, such as a straw, a bamboo skewer, a specially cut piece of balsa wood, a thin dowel piece or even a garden twig (make sure it is clean).


Use glue, tape or staples to attach the star.
 This will cover the top of the wand stick and gives the star added strength.


You might even consider stuffing the two stars. To do this, crumple up paper (newspaper, scrap paper) or cotton wool. Staple or glue almost of the way around the two stars to seal the edges. Leave a small gap. Stuff the star, then join up the last opening. The star is now three dimensional and puffy.
 There are lots of things you can do:


Paint or color the star with markers
Glue on sequins, buttons, artificial jewels, etc.
Sprinkle with glitter (either use glitter glue or use a glue stick and then shake on the glitter)
Glue on candies for a candy fan
Cover the star in foil. It can be left like this or glitter/flashy artificial gems can be added.
 Tie it into a neat bow or wind it around the wand stick and glue or tape in place.


You can also tie a strand of ribbons from the point at which the star base ends on the wand stick. Have the various ribbons cascade down to the base of the wand stick.

 After you decide what that will be, build on it. Say the theme is a man walking down a street. Well, you need to build on that! Make the audience think about what you are trying to express. Is he walking down a street at night, to a bar? If so, then the music might be something jazzy. If it's some seven-year-old girl skipping down the sidewalk to Peppy's Ice Cream, then the song will probably not be slow or jazzy. It would ideally be faster and "bouncy".;
, Going back to the man walking to a bar at night, you probably would want low voices (instrumental wise, not real voices) like Bass Clarinet, Tenor Saxophone, Trombone, or Baritone Sax. The preppy fun girl would probably be flutes or clarinets. You can also have a combination of instruments for the melody. For example, Bass Clarinet and Sax, or flute and clarinet.
 If you have a lower instrument playing the melody, you might want a higher instrument playing the harmony.
 Print out some manuscript paper and jot down everything you have. To transpose the song, see the tips for what key most common instruments are. But for now, let's say your transposing what you have on piano to Bb Trumpet. This means that on the trumpet, a 'C' would sound like a 'Bb' on Piano. So if the trumpet needs to play 'C' then you write it down as 'Bb'. Just go down one whole step (B, Bb)to see what the notes should be. This may sound confusing, but it won't when you do it.
 Let your imagination and creativity fly! Make the 1-page song a 5-page song! But don't get off the theme too much! If the slow jazzy feel turns into the faster preppy sound too suddenly, it won't make sense.
 That way it won't have eraser marks/scratch-outs form pen/white out on it. There are even programs out there where you just print out the notes. One is the Finale Notepad, available for free download at http://www.finalemusic.com/notepad/.
 Make sure it sounds alright, and adjust it accordingly.

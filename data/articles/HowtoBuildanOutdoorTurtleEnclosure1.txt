 You should only build an outdoor enclosure for your turtle if you live in an area that is relatively warm year round. A good rule of thumb is to see whether your turtle breed is native to similar climates. For instance, if you have a box turtle it’s a good idea to make sure that box turtles are native to your area before you plan an outdoor enclosure., When it comes to outdoor enclosures, bigger is usually better though a larger size will generally require more maintenance.The size of your yard, and the portion of your yard you’re willing to devote to the enclosure, will determine the size of your enclosure. Turtles do not grow to the size of their enclosure; their adult sizes are independent from the habitat they live in. You need to build a large enough enclosure for an adult turtle when you have a baby turtle.You will need to build a larger enclosure if you intend to house multiple turtles there. A suitable size enclosure for three or four relatively small turtles, like box turtles, should be five feet by five feet in size., Turtles need direct sunlight both for their health and well-being. They also need a shaded area that they can retreat to whenever they feel the need to be out of the sun. Many people choose to build the enclosure next to their home or a shed, since this creates a shaded area for a portion of the day and acts as a fourth wall for the enclosure.If you do choose to build along the side of your home, east and south facing walls are ideal locations since they receive sunlight early in the morning. This way, turtles can warm up after the night and it will mimic the daylight they’d receive in the wild.

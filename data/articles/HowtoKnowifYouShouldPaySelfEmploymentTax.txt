 If you work for yourself or own your own business, you may be required to pay a self-employment tax. The self-employment tax applies to any individual who:


is the sole proprietor of an unincorporated businessis a member of a trade or business partnershipworks as an independent contractorowns or is part of a limited liability company (LLC)earns income through rental property, including ownership of a trailer park or hotel propertyearns income through investments;
, Any individual who works alone and owns his own business is considered self-employed. This includes any part-time businesses, such as a private "side job" performing services in addition to a regular job or business.Anyone who is in business for himself is required to pay self-employment taxes.An example of an individual in business for himself would be a mechanic who is employed at a local repair shop but also offers side jobs from his home or garage., Any person who singlehandedly owns and operates an unincorporated business is considered a sole proprietor of that business, and must pay a self-employment tax.In a sole proprietorship, the business and the business owner are concerned an indistinguishable entity.Sole proprietors do not file separate personal and business taxes, as there is no legal separation between the business and the individual.Examples of a sole proprietor include:


a landscaper who works alone or employs a small crew to complete landscaping jobs
a self-employed technician who performs computer repairs, either from home or from a small commercial office
the owner of a small catering company
financial planners who work alone and are not part of a firm
certain home healthcare workers

, Anyone who works as a consultant or freelancer may be considered an independent contractor. An independent contractor is considered self-employed, as he works on projects for clients rather than working in a strictly employee/employer dynamic.Independent contractors are required to pay their own federal income tax and self-employment tax, since clients do not withhold any taxes from an independent contractor's wages.Independent contractors are only paid for work that is performed, rather than receiving a general hourly salary, and are not eligible for employee benefits (including overtime pay or minimum wage salaries) or worker's compensation benefits.Examples of independent contractors include:


a writer, designer, or editor who works independently on projects, works from home, and sets her own hours
an individual who collects samples for a researcher but is not employed or on payroll with that researcher's laboratory
an individual who is paid a predetermined sum of money to design and build a piece of equipment, where the individual sets his own hours and is only paid the agreed-upon sum of money regardless of how long it takes him to complete his task, A partnership is any working relationship between two or more individuals in which those individuals contribute money, property, skills, or labor to a trade or business and share in that business's financial profits and losses.That trade or business does not necessarily need to be a full-time operation; a part-time business, for example a "side job" in which individuals perform repairs or services, would be considered a self-employed business partnership.Any individual who is part of a trade or business partnership is required to pay self-employment taxes.Examples of a trade or business partnership include:


a real estate office owned by two or more agents working at that office
two or more doctors who share office space

, Property owners who receive rental income, including income from owning hotels and trailer park property, must declare the net income from that property as taxable. Net income is determined in this case by subtracting all deductible expenses related to operating that property from the gross rent payments received.Some landlords who earn their living as full-time landlords, as well as part-time landlords engaged in other real estate practices, may be exempt from the self-employment tax.If you're unsure whether you qualify for this exemption, it's best to speak with a tax return preparer.
 Individuals who receive income from investments are required to pay taxes on a portion of that income.If you're unsure what your tax obligations are as an investor, you may want to consult with a tax return preparer.
 A limited liability company (LLC) provides the limited liabilities of a corporation with the tax structure of a partnership. An LLC can be either a sole proprietorship or a partnership with two or more members.Any sole proprietor or member of an LLC is required to pay a self-employment tax., Self-employed individuals are still required to file an annual income tax return, even though taxes were not withheld from the income received throughout the year. To do this, self-employed individuals must file either Schedule C (Form 1040), which reports profits and/or losses from a sole proprietorship business, or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040), which reports net profits from a sole proprietorship business.Both forms are available on the IRS website.
 Any individual earning $400 or more through self-employment is required to pay a tax on those earnings. The self-employment tax is usually applied to 92.35% of the individual's net earnings for the year., Self-employed individuals may be required to make quarterly payments that estimate the individual's Social Security, Medicare, and income taxes. These taxes are usually based off of an estimated tax, since the individual does not have these taxes withheld by an employer, as a salaried employee would.Estimated taxes for quarterly payments are determined by filling out Form 1040-ES, available on the IRS website.
Estimated taxes generally must be paid by anyone expecting to owe $1,000 or more in tax, after subtracting withholdings and refundable credits.Estimated taxes must be paid quarterly. Taxes for the period of January 1 to March 31 must be paid by April 15; taxes for the period of April 1 to May 31 must be paid by June 15; taxes for the period of June 1 to August 31 must be paid by September 15; and taxes for the period of September 1 to December 31 must be paid by January 15 of the following calendar year., Self-employment tax covers the Social Security and Medicare taxes that would otherwise be deducted from your salary if you were an employee of a business. In 2014, the self-employment tax rate was 15.3%, of which 12.4% was applied to social security and 2.9% was applied to medicare., Self-employed individuals are permitted to deduct the cost of health insurance from their net taxable earnings when filing income taxes.More information about the qualifications for self-employed health insurance tax deductions can be found in the Form 1040 Instructions, available on the IRS website.
 If you are a self-employed individual, you may want to speak with a tax return preparer who can help you ensure that you're paying all the required taxes and deducting all the qualifying deductibles from your return. There are a few things you should keep in mind, should you decide to hire a tax return preparer.


Check the preparer's qualifications. All paid tax return preparers are required to have a Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN). Make sure your preparer has a PTIN, and consider hiring a preparer who is affiliated with a professional organization.Ask about service fees. Preparers who base their fees on a percentage of a client's refund may not be offering you the best possible services. Be similarly wary of preparers who promise to obtain a larger tax refund than other professional preparers, as these preparers may not be working ethically or legally.As if the preparer offers electronic filing. Any professionally paid preparer who works with more than 10 clients each year must file those returns electronically. Any preparer who does not offer electronic filing may be lacking in experience or procedural knowledge.Never sign a blank return. This is usually a sign of dishonesty and possible illegality.Always review your return before you sign it. Ask any questions you may have about the return that your preparer has produced for you before you sign it, to ensure that there are no questionable entries or potentially fraudulent claims.

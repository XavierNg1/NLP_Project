 This will take the chlorine off of you and help your swimsuit slide off of your body better. When showering, don't actually shampoo and condition your hair and wash your body, simply rinse your body off. It shouldn't take more than a minute to rinse off. You can take a real shower at home later.
 If there are empty changing rooms that are available to you, go into one, as this will give you optimal privacy while changing. If there are no rooms available, stand with your back to a wall. Make sure there are no mirrors!

, Dry off your legs well with the towel, so they have no moisture on them. Also, pat the swimsuit dry a little. This will stop your swimsuit from getting your legs wet again!

, This is more important when you're in public, as if you're in a changing room it doesn't really matter. Wrap the towel around your torso (make sure that it's long enough to cover everything.)

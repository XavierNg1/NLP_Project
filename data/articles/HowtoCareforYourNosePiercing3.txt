 You should be cleaning your piercing twice a day for the first three months. Before touching it, it is essential that you use antibacterial soap to wash your hands thoroughly. Skipping this step is often the cause of infection.
 A saline solution is a mixture of warm water and non-iodized sea salt. Your piercer can either sell you some from the studio, or he can tell you where to buy it. When you use it, it should be the temperature of a drinkable hot beverage. Place it in a microwaveable cup and heat it in 10 second increments. Once it is the correct temperature, take a sterile tissue and dip it into your solution with clean hands. Generously wipe down your piercing with the solution. The optimum time for your saline solution is right after you shower.
Do not reuse the same cup of solution.
 Throughout the day, resist the opportunity to play with your nose ring. Your hands are constantly covered in bacteria and this is a great way to get an infection. If you notice any build-up around the ring and you donâ€™t have your cleaning solution with you, wash your hands and soak the piercing for a few seconds in warm distilled water until the build up easily comes away. Do not move the jewellery in and out, as this may cause hypertrophic scarring.

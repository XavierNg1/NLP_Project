 Most people are nice when you get talking to them!;
, Don't be too obnoxious, but let people know you're there and want to be heard.
 If you get a laugh, it's even better!

, It sounds obvious, but most of us don't listen properly all the time. Bounce off them - they'll be more likely to chat if you talk about something they brought up.
 Most people can be drawn into a conversation about almost anything.
 Air your opinions. Even if someone disagrees with you, that's just an opportunity for a longer conversation!

If they disagree, you can ask something like "Why do you think so?" or "Tell me the reason why you disagree."







, It makes people much friendlier, and tricks them and you into believing you've got confidence!

,,, Make sure they are good stories with a point you don't want everyone to be wonder "why is she/he telling me this?" Remember the things you want to talk about and talk about it with more than just one person. Make a good list of things to talk about and talk about it.
 There must be a reason you want to talk about this so, go ahead.

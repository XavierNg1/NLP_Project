 Long wood matches or a butane lighter are preferable because they won't alter the flavor of the cigar. Don't use paper matches, gas lighters, or -- worst of all -- scented candles. You can also get a cigar lighter at the store.
 The foot of the cigar is the part you'll actually light. Hold the flame below the foot without touching it, and rotate the cigar a few times until the foot is evenly warmed. This will warm up your tobacco and make it easier to light.
 Hold the flame in front of the cigar without touching it. Then, inhale just enough so that the cigar is lit. Make sure not to inhale the smoke.
 You can do this to make sure that the light is evenly distributed. To check if the cigar is fully lit, turn the lit end towards your mouth and gently blow on it; the lit portions will light up orange.

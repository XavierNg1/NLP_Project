 The only Gible available in this entire generation can be found in Floccesy Town in Black 2. You can receive this Shiny Gible from Benga after defeating him in Black City.Since this is the only Gible available in this generation of Pok√©mon games, you'll need to trade it from Black 2 to White, Black, or White 2 if you want to use it in those games.
 The Gible you receive is only Level 1, so it will probably take a little while to raise it to Level 24. The best way to get quick experience for Gible is to put it at the front of your party and then switch it out immediately with a strong Pokemon. Gible will split the experience gained at the end of the battle.

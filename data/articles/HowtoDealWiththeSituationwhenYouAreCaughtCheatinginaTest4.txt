 This can be tricky, and it might take a little bit of self-reflection. However, it’s extremely important to determine what led you to cheat in the first place.Were you stumped by the subject? Were you too busy with extracurricular activities to study? Did you feel pressured by your parents to get a perfect grade? Be honest with yourself about why you resorted to cheating, whether or not it is a great reason.


You don’t necessarily need to tell anyone what you figure out about yourself, but keep it as useful knowledge going forward.
 If you were confused about the subject matter on the test, make a plan to work with a tutor, study an extra hour after school, or meet with your teacher to ask questions. If you couldn’t find the time to study between your other after school commitments, you need to quit some of your extracurriculars (or rearrange your schedule) in order to make school a priority.


No matter what caused you to cheat, you should be able to make a plan to follow going forward.
While apologizing and accepting your punishment is OK once, making this plan will help it from becoming a routine occurrence.
 This is your chance to prove yourself and show that you are not a cheater. Hold yourself accountable, and remind yourself how unpleasant your punishment was. If you need to study more, turn off your cell phone and really commit to studying for a block of time without distractions. If you need extra help, reach out to your teacher and schedule a time to meet that you can’t flake on.You may need to make sacrifices in order to become a better student, but this will be worth it in order to avoid the temptation to cheat and the punishment that comes along with it.

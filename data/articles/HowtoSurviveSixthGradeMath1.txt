 A ratio is a way to compare numbers.In sixth grade you will start working more with fractions and calculating ratios.A fraction is a type of ratio called “part-to-whole.” The numerator tells you the number of parts you have, the denominator tells you the number of parts in the whole. So, if you have 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}} of a pizza, you have 3 parts (probably slices), and the entire pizza is made of 4 parts, or slices.

The other type of ratio is called “part-to-part.” This type of ratio tells you how many parts of a whole one group is, compared with how many parts another group is. For example, the ratio of girls to boys in a classroom might be 2:1. This means that for every 2 girls in the classroom, there is 1 boy.

, You will begin dividing fractions in sixth grade, which includes dividing fractions by whole numbers, and fractions by fractions.To  divide by a fraction, you take the reciprocal of one of the numbers and multiply.

A reciprocal is found by “flipping” a fraction: the numerator becomes the denominator, and the denominator becomes the numerator.For example, the reciprocal of 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}} is 43{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{3}}}.

As an example, to divide 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}} by 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}}, take the reciprocal of 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} and multiply:34÷14{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}\div {\frac {1}{4}}}34×41{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}\times {\frac {4}{1}}}=3×44×1{\displaystyle ={\frac {3\times 4}{4\times 1}}}=124{\displaystyle ={\frac {12}{4}}}=3{\displaystyle =3}


, In sixth grade you will begin learning basic algebra skills involving variables.A variable is a letter that stands for an unknown value in a math equation.You will need to understand what variables mean, as well as how to  solve for them.

For example, the variable 4y{\displaystyle 4y} is equal to y+y+y+y{\displaystyle y+y+y+y}. It is also equal to 4×y{\displaystyle 4\times y} and 2×2×y{\displaystyle 2\times 2\times y}.

To solve the equation y+3=11{\displaystyle y+3=11}, you need to find the value of y{\displaystyle y}. To find the value of y{\displaystyle y}, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:y+3=11{\displaystyle y+3=11}y+3−3=11−3{\displaystyle y+3-3=11-3}y=8{\displaystyle y=8}

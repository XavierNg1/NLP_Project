 Testosterone treatment is a generally safe medical procedure—however, the most serious possible risk for men is prostate cancer. Studies have indicated that the risk of prostate cancer as a result of testosterone treatments is highest among African-American men and men over 40.All men over the age of 50 need to be monitored for prostate cancer while receiving testosterone treatments.
 A variety of health concerns can develop from testosterone treatments. Working with your doctor, you may be able to reduce the risk of these medical conditions by regulating the amount of testosterone you receive with each treatment and the duration of your testosterone treatments. Other possible risks of testosterone treatment include:Increased red blood cell count
Acne
Reduced sperm count
Sleep apnea
Enlarged or tender breasts

, Testosterone-boosting treatments are generally not recommended for men undergoing cancer treatment—especially if the treatment is for prostate cancer, since testosterone treatment can increase the size of the prostate.As you undergo testosterone treatment, be sure to continue having your testosterone levels checked, in order to monitor their resurgence or continued diminishment.
 You should only plan to increase your testosterone levels through doctor-prescribed treatments, and through natural methods like exercise and diet modification. Many supplements—including those advertised online or in infomercials—will do your body little good and will not help boost testosterone levels.This supplement restriction includes taking supplements of hormone DHEA: a naturally produced hormone that your body converts into testosterone. Your body produces DHEA on its own, and taking DHEA supplements will have little effect on your testosterone levels.
If you’ve heard about a herbal testosterone treatment or are thinking of beginning a homeopathic method, always ask your doctor before you begin.

 Many women have a delay of several hours or even days before breast milk supply fully arrives.


Let-down of milk may be delayed by medication, a surgical birth, or extended separation from your baby after birth. Do not get frustrated if your milk supply seems to be delayed, as most women take up to a week to get a full supply in their breasts on a regular basis.
 The first several days after your baby is born, you may only produce colostrum. Colostrum arrives before regular milk and is thick, yellowish fluid that provides high fat content and important antibodies and nutrients to your baby. In the first several days after birth, this is the only nutrition your baby is likely to need, and the amount you may produce during feeding will be small but adequate for your newborn.
 Direct contact with your baby encourages the release of hormones in your body that stimulate milk production and emotional bonding with your child. Cuddling and letting the baby rest on your bare skin will help signal your body to produce breast milk.
 The process of giving birth naturally signals your body to begin milk production.


Unless you have a medical condition or physical problem that precludes milk production (which is very rare), your body will produce what is necessary for your baby to consume during the first week. Your newborn’s stomach will be small, and his or her nutritional needs will be limited.
As your baby’s nutritional needs and stomach size grow, your milk supply will also increase, and your production will keep pace with or exceed your baby’s needs.

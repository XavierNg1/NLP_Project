 Fortunately, ceramic braces are already far subtler than traditional braces. There are some choices you can make, however, to make them even less obvious.


Ask your orthodontist for tooth-colored wire. This is less noticeable, and will blend better with your ceramic braces and clear ligatures.
Ask your orthodontist for self-ligating ceramic braces. This is a type of ceramic braces where the wire clips directly into the bracket, eliminating the need for stainable elastics around each bracket.
 The brackets will stain yellowish if they are not brushed correctly. This will make them much more noticeable.


Brush your teeth 2-4 times a day with non-whitening toothpaste. If you use whitening toothpaste, your teeth may have yellowish spots when your braces are removed, from where the braces prevented contact between the toothpaste and your teeth.Floss at least once a day.
 While you should avoid whitening toothpaste, you should also do what you can to keep your teeth and/or braces from yellowing. This will draw the wrong sort of attention to your mouth.


If you drink colored juices or sodas, use a straw.Avoid foods that may stain your braces and rubber bands. This includes berries, soups, pasta sauce, etc. If you do decide to eat a food that may stain, brush your braces immediately after eating that food.
Drink water with your meals to help rinse your braces while eating.
 Usually ceramic braces go along with clear ligatures. These can stain easily, so getting them changed regularly at the orthodontist is a must.

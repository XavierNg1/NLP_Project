 You can always pick up more as you go along.
 You might want to set up one or two others as well.
 It doesn't really matter how you start. It could be either regular life, a holiday, or a twist.
 It doesn't really need to be a long event- or an exciting one for that matter. Just start with an event.
 If you have no ideas, then try planning something in detail instead.

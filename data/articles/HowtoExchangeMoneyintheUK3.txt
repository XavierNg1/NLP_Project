 Many companies will sell you foreign currency, but you need to be aware of these companies' exchange rates. Some companies have higher exchange rates than others. Additionally, exchange rates are constantly changing. Check with your own bank first. Your own bank usually offers lower exchange rates to its customers.


You can monitor exchange rates by downloading apps on your phone or computer that specifically do this. For example, XE Currency is a free app that works for both Androids and iPhones. Currency and Currency+ are both free exchange rate apps that work on iPhones. Exchange Rates and Easy Currency Converter are both free exchange rate apps that work on Androids.
There are also exchange rate monitor services on the Internet that will alert you if a rate has changed through e-mail or other notifications.
 Before you leave, determine how much money you will need for your whole trip. Then, calculate how much pocket money you will need upon arriving for transportation, food, and other immediate expenses. Also, remember to factor in exchange rates and fees when calculating how much money you will need. Exchange your money at home before you leave abroad.It is always best to have a variety of payment options, i.e., cash, card, checks, because if you lose one, you will still have other ways to exchange your money.
 Before traveling, always notify your bank that you will be traveling to your destination. This will prevent the bank from putting a hold on your card for suspicious charges. Call your bankâ€™s toll-free number and notify them about where and when you will be traveling.

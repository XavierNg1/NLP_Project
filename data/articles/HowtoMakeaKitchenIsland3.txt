 Find a dresser that is suitable to make into a kitchen island. Overly long or very heavy dressers will make poor kitchen islands. Instead, look for something which is roughly the length and width of the area you want to occupy in your kitchen.


If you want the island to be a different color when itâ€™s done, paint the dresser now as it will be more difficult to do once the top has been replaced.
 If the top of the dresser is too low, you can raise it to proper height by adding legs (if you want it stationary), wheels (if you want it mobile), or both (if you need more height than just wheels can provide). Be sure to factor in any changes you will be making to the countertop, as adding a thicker countertop will also add height.


How these legs and wheels are added will vary widely depending on the style of the dresser. Consult with a local expert for advice and be sure to follow any additional instructions included with the packaging of wheels or legs.
 If the back of the dresser is unsightly or damaged, replace it by cutting or having cut a custom sized piece of MDF or particleboard. Carefully remove the old one and then nail the new one into place.


You can add usability to the back by painting it with chalkboard paint to create a blackboard for writing grocery lists or as doodle space for the kids.
Another way to use the space would be to screw hooks or bars into and solid, stationary sections on the other side of the backing. These can be used to hang kitchen towels, paper towels, oven mitts, or kitchen tools.
 If you want to have a more food-prep friendly countertop, you can carefully remove the existing dresser top and replace it with a custom sized countertop of your preferred material. If the existing top is fairly rectangular with clean, straight edges, you should be able to tile it easily. What you do will largely depend on your skill, needs, and preferences.

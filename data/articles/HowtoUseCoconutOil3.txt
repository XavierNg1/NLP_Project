 You can use coconut oil in other types of cuisine, as well, but the flavor may clash more frequently than it will with Thai or Indian cuisine.
 If you are going for a more traditional flavor with a particular baked good, like chocolate chip cookies or red velvet cake, it might be best to skip the coconut oil. For added depth of flavor, though, you can replace part or all of the fat called for in a baked good recipe with coconut oil. Since extra virgin coconut oil also tends to be a little sweet, you can also reduce the amount of sugar used in the recipe.


Chilled coconut oil works especially well when used in place of butter for pie crusts and similar dough.
 Even though it can be used as a substitute for other fats, there are also a number of recipes for which coconut oil is the first choice. These recipes usually include dessert recipes, like frostings, ice creams, candies, and puddings, but there are some savory recipes that call for coconut oil, too. Examples include bean dishes and soups.
 A small dash of extra virgin coconut oil added to a smoothie, tea, eggnog, or hot chocolate is enough to provide you with the benefits coconut oil offers along with a mild hint of coconut flavor.
 Extra virgin coconut oil has a sweet taste that is reminiscent of golden or brown butter. As such, it can be drizzled over popcorn and other foods for which you might usually drizzle with butter.

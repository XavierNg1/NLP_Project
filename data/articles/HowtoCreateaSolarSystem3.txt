 Blow 9 balloons at different sizes.
 Papier mache the balloons so that the bottom portion where it starts to turn into a point is left uncovered. Let the papier mache dry and then pop and remove the balloons.
 Use strips of papier mache to close the gaps left by the balloon and make the overall shape more spherical.
 Paint the papier mache balls to resemble the planets using basic acrylic or tempera paints.
 Get a long length of string and attach the planets and sun to the string in order. Tie up the string across a room and enjoy!

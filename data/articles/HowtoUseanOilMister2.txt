 You can put natural oils, like olive oil, jojoba oil, and coconut oil directly onto your hair. Store bought commercial hair oils generally have an oily consistency and may contain natural oils, but usually include other additives, some of which you may want to avoid. Commercial hair oils may also have special application procedures, so you should always read the label before buying one.


Natural oils, like olive oil, have the added benefit of being a readily available kitchen ingredient.
Store bought hair oils often target certain negative features, like excessive curliness, frizziness, and dullness., Depending on your oil mister, this process may vary slightly. In most cases, you'll have to remove a top and take out the pump mechanism of the mister. Then, add your oil to the mister and put it back together. After that:


Use the priming cap or a primer lever to pump up your oil mister and pressurize it. In most cases, this takes 7 to 10 pumps., Remove the priming cap, if necessary, then hold the mister in your hand. Spray a fine mist of oil onto your hair by pressing and holding the top button. This should emit a steady mist for as long as you hold the button, so long as pressure remains.


Depending on your model of oil mister, you may have to re-prime it one or two times while misting your hair.
Use your free hand to lift your hair in layers as you mist so the upper and lower layers of your hair receive oil.
You may want to wear an old shirt or drape a towel around your shoulders when applying oil to your hair to prevent oil stains from getting on your clothes., Even when using your hands to lift layers of your hair while applying the oil, it's likely that some spots received more oil than others. Comb your fingers through your hair after you mist to ensure all of your hair receives the benefits of the oil.

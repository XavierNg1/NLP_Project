 Singing can help to improve muscle control in your throat and in the soft tissues in your throat. Toning these muscles can reduce your chance of sleep apnea. Try singing along to a favorite song once per day or more often to give these muscles a workout.
 Jaw muscles can also contribute to sleep apnea, so it is important to strengthen these as well. To strengthen your jaw muscles, hold a pencil between your teeth for about five to 10 minutes per day., The muscles in and around your mouth also play an important role in breathing, so strengthening these muscles may also help cure your sleep apnea.Try pursing your lips as if you are going to give someone a kiss. Then, hold your lips like that for about 30 to 60 seconds and release. Repeat this exercise a few times per day.
 Blowing up balloons can improve your lung capacity and give the muscles in your mouth and throat a good workout as well. Try blowing up a few balloons each day to strengthen your breathing muscles., There is some evidence that exercising can reduce the severity of sleep apnea.Even if you don't experience weight loss from your exercise, you may still experience some relief.
 Gargling water can help to tone the muscles in the back of your throat as well. Try gargling with water a few times per day to build up these muscles.You can also gargle mouthwash after you brush your teeth in the morning and at night.
This is not proven to help with sleep apnea, but it may be worth trying.

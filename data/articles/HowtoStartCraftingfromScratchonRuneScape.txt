 It is located in Barbarian village. Just run through and you will get 10k(10000). This is not a must,you can do other things too. Such as picking up ashes and selling them at the Grand Exchange(GE)The GE is located at Varrock.We are looking for an amount of 5-10k to begin your crafting journey.Do other skills to make this money.


Having your money(5k-10k)There is not much you can do. Go to the Barbarian village with a pickaxe. Once there,you will find a mining spot around the village(under it). Once there mine the clay. Now, run up and find a well. Use the clay on the well to get soft clay. Now run almost back until you get a pottery place. Use the soft clay on the wheel and make pots. When this is done,use the unfired pots on the potter oven. Repeat this process until you are level 8 crafting.;
, An amulet mould and as many gold bars as you can!Have the mould and 27 gold bars in your inventory. Now use the bar on a furnace and choose to make gold amulets! You can make lots of cash! Don't string the amulets! Sell them like they are at the GE!

,, Again don't string them. You will need:Amulet mould and half of inventory dragonstones and other half gold bars.One inventory spot will be open if you split them 50/50. Put a weightless item there.(Like a feather)You will make more money with this and also more xp. Do this till 99 for a lot of cash! (Note this method of Dragonstone amulets is members only)

, At times it can actually turn a massive profit! Between 500k-1.4mil! This is a great way to make money!

, Try experimenting with faster options that don't make money.


Now you have 99 crafting and that awesome looking skillcape without losing any money at all!

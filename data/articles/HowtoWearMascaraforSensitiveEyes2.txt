 If your eye sensitivity is related to allergies, you may want to use medication to help your eyes. Antihistamines can be effective in helping itchy, watery eyes, especially if you have a seasonal allergy that messes up your mascara.This probably isnâ€™t something you can do every day, but it might help for special occasions or days when your allergies are making your eyes particularly problematic.
 Another way you can help eye sensitivity when you wear makeup is to use eyedrops before you apply it. This can help if you have red, watery, or itchy eyes. If you want to use eyedrops, get allergy relief ones.Make sure you use the eyedrops before you apply the mascara. Try at least 15 to 30 minutes before.
If you think you are going to need eyedrops while wearing mascara, consider using waterproof mascara.
 Before you use a mascara on your eyes, test it first. This can help you figure out if the mascara will affect you negatively or not. Smear some mascara on the inside of your arm, put a bandage or piece of tape over it, and then leave it all day.Remove the tape at the end of the day. If there is no redness, the mascara is okay. If your skin is red, then you should try another mascara.

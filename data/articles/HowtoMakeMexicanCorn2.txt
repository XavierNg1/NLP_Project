If you don't have a roasting rack, you can cook the ears of corn directly on the oven rack. Do not coat the oven rack with nonstick cooking spray, but thoroughly clean it before and after roasting the corn.
 Place the roasting rack on the middle shelf of the oven, and bake the corn for approximately 30 minutes, or until it is tender and cooked through.


Note that you should keep the husks on the corn when using the roasting technique. Do not husk the corn before cooking it.
The exact amount of cooking time will vary depending on the size of the ears and the level of doneness you prefer. You should begin checking the corn after 25 minutes. Continue checking it every 5 to 10 minutes after that, cooking the corn up to 45 minutes if needed.
 Remove the finished corn from the oven. Let it cool slightly, then peel away the husks.


Place the corn on a separate cooling rack and wait at least 5 minutes for it to cool. Once you can safely handle it without burning your fingers, peel off the husks.
You can either completely remove the husks or wrap them around the stem end of each ear to serve as a handle.
 Spread the butter evenly over each ear of corn, then coat all sides of the corn with a thin layer of mayonnaise.


You can either roll the corn in the melted butter or brush the butter on using a pastry brush.
Use a butter knife or spoon to spread the mayonnaise.
 Sprinkle the corn with chili powder, chopped cilantro, and cotija cheese. Apply as much or as little as desired according to your sense of taste.


Note that cotija cheese is the most conventional option, but if you don't have any, you can substitute grated Parmesan or Romano cheese. Finely crumbled Feta cheese could also work.
 Cut the lime into wedges. Immediately serve the corn with one or two of these lime wedges and enjoy it while it's still hot.

, Not look through, this wouldn't have any plain result rather than improving their logic skills. Basically, the longer they stargaze, the higher the chance of them being abducted. So start your Sim stargazing as soon as it gets dark. There is no optimum time during the night. People come up with times (between midnight and 4am, usually) but there's nothing in the coding for that.
 What happens is the first hour, there is a really small chance of them being abducted, the second hour, the chance gets higher, the third hour, higher again and so on. However, if they stop for any reason and then start again, the chance of abduction goes back to the first hour.
 Aliens will abduct your Sims at night or early morning (any time that it is dark outside). Any teen or older Sim can be abducted by aliens, but only adult males will come back pregnant.
 Take the shortcut: CTRL+SHIFT+C and type "BoolProp testingcheatsenabled true" without the quotation marks.Do this in the neighbourhood mode,the go to your sims house.Select your Sim, shift-click on the telescope while the abducted-to-be Sim is in control, and select FORCE ABDUCTION or whatever it says. Your Sim will look through the telescope and get abducted. "BoolProp testingcheatsenabled false" turns the cheat off.

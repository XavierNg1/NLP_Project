 Roll back the right sleeve if you are right-handed, or the left sleeve if you are left-handed.
 Move the can so that the nozzle at one end is even with your wrist. Rotate the can so that the nozzle is pointing away from you.
 Have the assistant wrap a strip of masking tape around the top of the can, just below the nozzle, and your arm. Roll the sleeve down so that it covers your arm and the can.
 Have your assistant stand a few feet away and pretend to be a bad guy.
 Turn your hand over so that your palm is facing you. Aim your hand at the "bad guy." Press the nozzle with your thumb to fire your "web."

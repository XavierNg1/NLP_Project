 Sunlight can actually be harmful to sofas. You should keep sofas away from open windows. Draw your blinds during peak sunlight hours in your area.If you dislike keeping your blinds closed, see if you can purchase stain protection when buying a sofa. This is an added feature that will protect a sofa from harmful UV rays.
 If you're having people over, this greatly increases the chances of your sofa becoming stained. You can move your sofa into another room of the house and put out fold-out chairs instead. However, if you don't want your guests to feel uncomfortable, you can also put a cover over your sofa when you have people over.


You can buy a suitable slip cover for your sofa at a local furniture store.
 Leather furniture requires greater protection than other sofas. You can drape lightweight sheets over leather furniture when it's not in use. This will protect your leather furniture from sunlight, dirt, and debris.Cleaning will go much quicker if you cover leather furniture, as it will not gather as much dust and dirt.
 Only sit on the portions of a sofa designed for sitting. Sitting on a sofa's armrest can cause damage.If you live with others, especially young children, make sure everyone in your household knows not to sit on a sofa's armrest.
